The company said it has focused pharmaceutical pipeline and continuously developed it further. The company has also announced plans for growth in the following years. By 2022, Merck wants to generate sales of around 4 billion euros with new products. The company said its pharma pipeline offers new sales potential of around 2 billion euros up to 2022. Merck noted that starting in 2017, it aims to gain approval of one medicine or new indication every year. Life Science and Performance Materials innovations each would add around 1 billion euros in sales by 2022. In its Life Science business sector, Merck is benefiting from strong demand from the biopharmaceutical industry and has been growing faster than the market. Merck has also realized synergies from the Sigma-Aldrich faster than planned. At the end of 2016, the company will already have leveraged 105 million euros as compared with the originally planned amount of 90 million euros in annually recurring cost synergies. Sigma-Aldrich integration will exceed synergy targets by 20 million euros thanks to additional top-line synergies. The company informed analysts and investors at its 2016 Capital Market Day about the progress it has made in achieving its objectives up to the year 2018. CEO Stefan Oschmann and CFO Marcus Kuhnert also provided a look at the period after 2018, the year which marks the company's 350th anniversary.

In July, it was revealed Ms Iskandar was renting out illegal garage conversions to desperate tenants - many of them beneficiaries - for hundreds of dollars a week. Now, documents released to Newshub show the Ministry for Social Development found Ms Iskandar was not lodging tenants' bonds. 'Predatory' property managers renting out Auckland garages That is illegal, and the MSD's fraud unit is investigating Ms Iskandar over concerns she could be taking advantage of vulnerable people. The MSD began receiving complaints about Ms Iskandar in January. However, it wasn't until after Newshub's story went to air in July that they escalated their action against her. Self-described property agent Ms Iskandar told Newshub's undercover journalist she was renting out an illegally converted garage for $420 a week. It was one of many. Work and Income paid $2000 towards the garage bond. It had no running water, kitchen or bathroom, and was lived in by a mum on a benefit with two young children. "Those are her perfect people - people who are vulnerable. She ain't going out looking for a worker, she is going to go for the Government," says Jacine Greaves, a former tenant of Ms Iskandar. In the past year Ms Iskandar received 364 Work and Income grants for tenants she was housing - but MSD's keeping the dollar value of those payments secret. "She would write you any kind of letter you needed to get more accommodation supplement," says Ms Greaves. Although the intelligence unit did not find any offending against the MSD by Ms Iskandar, officials noted: "often these cases turn out to be a crime against the client". It was decided more investigation was needed. However, despite knowing its clients - beneficiaries - could be at risk, MSD waited two months before handing the problem to its Auckland fraud team. That investigation is ongoing. During Newshub's investigation into Ms Iskandar, Work and Income said it had stopped referring clients to her six months earlier. However, emails show it was still sending single clients her way, where there were no other options available. Case managers clearly worried about the quality of Ms Iskandar's accommodation, the number of families sharing rooms, and rooms costing $280 per week. But they were conflicted about meeting urgent housing needs while reconciling concerns about suitability of the accommodation - in other words, they had few other options. Four months after the first complaints to MSD, case workers wanted to stop using Ms Iskandar but were "unsure whether they could legally do this". "The decent thing to do was to say 'we think this lady is dodgy - don't move into her property', considering they were the ones paying out the money," says Ms Greaves. MSD's intelligence unit concluded Newshub's investigation showed "Iskandar is doing what their assessment found earlier in the year". But it is only now MSD has decided to escalate things - Work and Income has been told not to make any more payments to Ms Iskandar. MSD was approached for an interview but would only agree to it if Newshub provided pre-written questions, which we declined to do. In a statement, national commissioner Penny Rounthwaite said MSD has "acknowledged delays in communication and identified where we had not escalated these concerns quickly enough". Lawyers for Ms Iskandar say they believe the information supplied to Newshub under the Official Information Act was provided in breach of their client's privacy. Newshub.

Joyce Lay; Dr. Joe Simpson; Chairman Senate Committee on Health, Senator Lanre Tejuoso; Chief Social Officer, Merck Healthcare, Dr. Rasha Kelej; President, African Fertility Society, Prof.Oladapo Ashiru; Intercontinental Region, Merck, Yiannis Viontzos and Commissioner for Health, Ogun State, Dr. Faye Iketubosin, during the ‘Merck More than a Mother' launch in Lagos ...recently Martins Ifijeh Over 250,000 Nigerian couples are currently battling with infertility in the country, Senate Chairman, Committee on Health, Senator LanreTejuosho has said. He said the issue of childlessness was often blamed on the women, even though reports suggest 50 per cent of infertility problems were caused by men. “This perception does not represent the reality, as the causes of infertility are often shared between males and females,” he said. Tejuosho, who spoke during the ‘Merck More than a Mother’ initiative by Merck Pharmaceuticals in Lagos, said one in four Nigerian couples have infertility challenge, adding that this statistics needs some attention. “We need to focus on how we will make the health institutions accessible to them for infertility management.” While decrying stigmatisation of women due to fertility challenges, he called for increased advocacy so that men will also know it is not an exclusive problem of the women. “When men are also very enlightened on this, they will have the courage to come out with their wives to seek treatment, so that treatment efforts can be directed accordingly. Awareness and education can greatly reduce the high number of infertility in the country,” he added. Noting that the federal government was putting all efforts on ground to ensure healthcare centres were strengthened across the country, Tejuosho explained that within the next two years, there would be 10,000 functioning health centres across political wards of the country. He also noted that the legislature will close ranks during health budgeting to make sure health centres have the capacity to attend to infertility issues. Lending his voice, the Chief Social Officer, Merck Pharmaceuticals, Dr. Rasha Kelej, said the main reason for the establishment of Merck was to empower women in Africa and also to create awareness to change the mindset of people against infertility. “We are here in Africa to empower women to create awareness, information, health and change of mindset. It makes me sad listening to stories on stigmatisation, especially when only the women are blamed for infertility. Men do not want to admit the fact that they can be the cause of infertility as well. “We want to change all these. We know changing culture and belief is very difficult, but with integration and cooperation of the media, there can be awareness on infertility, which would also help eliminate stigmatisation. Women are to be respected,” she added. While urging men to boldly cone out and speak of their fertility problem, she urged the society to respect women. “Even if they don’t have children, we should respect and appreciate them and they will become reproductive members of the society as well,” Kelej noted.

Mrs. Buhari who is also the initiator of Future Assured and the Chairman Senate Committee on Health, Senator Lanre Tejuoso disclosed this during the “Merck More than a Mother” in Nigeria Campaign Launch in Abuja. “Merck More than a Mother” initiated by Dr. Rasha Kelej – Chief Social Officer of Merck – aims to empower infertile women by improving access to information, education, healthcare, change of culture, mindset and to de-stigmatize infertility. Mrs. Buhari in a speech read on her behalf by the Vice President’s wife, Mrs. Dolapo Osinbajo,  pledged her support in the implementation of “Merck More than a Mother’s” activities in Nigeria – with emphasis on creating awareness and providing information and education on causes of infertility; facilitating access to healthcare; and economic and social empowerment of infertile women. She expressed her willingness to help strengthen advocacy for women with infertility challenges through her Future Assured Initiative Project. On his part, Chairman Senate Committee on Health, Senator Lanre Tejuoso, said the Senate would initiate a legislation on Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) in the country. Wife of the Senate President, Mrs. Toyin Saraki, in her remarks, called for partnership between government and the private sector to make infertility treatment affordable. Saraki’s wife who spoke on behalf of wives of other Senators said that they would carry the message of the “Merck More than a Mother” campaign to every Senatorial District in the country. A panel discussion by fertility experts and policy makers during the launch called for an end to the stigmatization of infertile women; creation of awareness and education on the causes of infertility and management since over 85% of the cases are caused by infections which can be treated and prevented. They added that it also involved building advocacy for the development of ART laws to improve the governance and quality of fertility care; improving access to fertility care by integrating it into public reproductive health services and building the capacity to provide quality and safe fertility care through training. The panelists also supported the empowerment of infertile women who form a vulnerable part of the population and noted that infertile women in Nigeria and many other African countries who can no longer be treated have been empowered socially and economically to lead independent and happier lives through “Empowering Berna” initiative. “Empowering Berna” is part of “Merck More than a Mother” campaign. The panel included Senator Dr. Lanre Tejuoso, the Chairman Senate Committee of Health; Minister of Health, Prof.  Isaac Adewole, Minister of Women Affairs, Senator Aisha Alhassan and Uganda’s Minister of State for Health, Hon. Sarah Opendi. Others are a Member of the Kenyan Parliament, Hon. Joyce Lay; National Coordinator, Future Assured, Dr. Mohammed Kamal; President of Africa Fertility Society, Prof. Oladapo Ashiru and Chief Social Officer of Merck Pharmaceuticals, Rasha Kelej.

This was one of the findings of the first global curiosity study from Merck, a leading science and technology company. The study examines the curiosity index of workers in four dimensions. The goal: To compare curiosity levels at work in an international context. Even though curiosity plays an important role on the job, the majority of study participants did not describe themselves as curious. Only one in five employees (20 percent) identified with this quality. Staff instead described themselves as organised, collaborative, and detail-oriented. "Curious" came only in twelfth place. Nevertheless, this quality holds great potential for a company's ability to innovate. "Innovation and technological progress do not appear out of the blue. They always develop out of a person's sense of curiosity about something new. Scientific curiosity and the joy of discovery are thus our most important resources when it comes to finding answers to global challenges such as the aging of our society or population growth," says Stefan Oschmann, Chairman of the Executive Board and CEO of Merck. "That's why curiosity should be a key aspect of our everyday work." Four dimensions of curiosity  Merck examined with its Curiosity Study 2016 the extent to which staff are able to make the most of their curiosity at work, and if they are encouraged to do so. Last year, the company already surveyed 1,013 full-time employees online in the US. In 2016, Merck expanded its survey to China and Germany in order to draw a global comparison, since these three countries are characterised by different cultures and economic systems. To define the concept of curiosity, and to make it measurable, Merck has worked closely with curiosity expert Todd Kashdan, who teaches at George Mason University in the United States. Together, they came up with four dimensions of curiosity: Inquisitiveness, creativity, openness, and distress tolerance. For the study, Merck conducted more than 3,000 online surveys with full-time employees in Germany, the US, and China. Focus group interviews were also carried out. Lack of creative freedom  Just because employees do not describe themselves as curious, does not necessarily mean that they're not. They simply do not exhibit this quality as strongly outwardly - likely because curiosity is usually not as appreciated in their daily work as other qualities. The survey results also support this thesis. Thus, 73 percent of respondents do not feel comfortable asking more questions at work. Nearly one out of every two workers surveyed in Germany (45 percent) agreed with the statement that they are discouraged by their employer from challenging the status quo. To develop new ideas, employees first and foremost need flexibility: 35 percent of German employees cited self-directed work as the most important factor. Promote curiosity  Merck launched the Curiositiy Initiative in August 2016 to promote curiosity. On the interactive online platform at curiosity.merckgroup.com, visitors can take a self-test to find out how curious they are. There are also tips for overcoming creative blocks and a number of fascinating articles on the subject of curiosity. The scientific foundation of the Curiosity Initiative is the Merck Curiosity Council, consisting of experts in the field of curiosity research. The Council is composed of Professor Todd Kashdan of George Mason University in Virginia, USA, and Dr. Carl Naughton, German-English author, scholar, and speaker. He has researched and taught in the field of educational psychology at the University of Cologne, and  also written books on the topics of thinking, communication, and curiosity. Further members of the Council include Andreas Steinle, CEO of the Future Institute in Kelkheim/Frankfurt and Dr. Kunlin Wei, Professor of Psychology at the Institute for Psychological and Cognitive Sciences at the University of Beijing, China.

Mrs. Buhari, who is also the initiator of ‘Future Assured’ and the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Senator Lanre Tejuoso, made this known during the “Merck More Than A Mother” campaign launch in Abuja. “Merck More than a Mother” campaign, which was initiated by Dr. Rasha Kelej, the Chief Social Officer of Merck, aims to empower infertile women by improving access to information, education, healthcare, change of culture, mindset and to de-stigmatise infertility. For her part, Mrs Buhari, represented by the Vice President’s wife, Mrs. Dolapo Osinbajo,  pledged her support in the implementation of “Merck More than a Mother” campaign activities in Nigeria with emphasis on creating awareness and providing information and education on causes of infertility; facilitating access to healthcare; and economic and social empowerment of infertile women. She stated that she will help strengthen advocacy for women with infertility challenges through her Future Assured initiative project. Also speaking, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Senator Tejuoso, said the Senate would initiate a legislation on Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) in the country. Earlier, Wife of the Senate President, Barr. Toyin Saraki, in her remarks, called for a partnership between government and the private sector to make infertility treatment affordable. On behalf of fellow Senators’ wives, Saraki’s wife committed that they would carry the message of the “Merck More than a Mother” campaign to every senatorial district in the country. Meanwhile, a panel discussion by fertility experts and policy makers during the launch called for an end to the stigmatization of infertile women; creation of awareness and education on the causes of infertility and management since over 85% of the cases are caused by infections which can be treated and prevented. The panelists added that it also involved building advocacy for the development of ART laws to improve the governance and quality of fertility care; improving access to fertility care by integrating it into public reproductive health services and building the capacity to provide quality and safe fertility care through training.  They also expressed support for the empowerment of infertile women who form a vulnerable part of the population and noted that infertile women in Nigeria and many other African countries who can no longer be treated have been empowered socially and economically to lead independent and happier lives through “Empowering Berna” initiative. “Empowering Berna” is part of “Merck More than a Mother” campaign. The panel included Senator Dr. Lanre Tejuoso; Minister of Health, Prof.  Isaac Adewole; Minister of Women Affairs, Senator Aisha Alhassan; and Uganda’s Minister of State for Health, Hon. Sarah Opendi. Others were a member of the Kenyan Parliament, Hon. Joyce Lay; National Coordinator, Future Assured, Dr. Mohammed Kamal; President of Africa Fertility Society, Prof. Oladapo Ashiru; and Chief Social Officer of Merck Pharmaceuticals, Rasha Kelej.

 A new kind of drug is working better than chemotherapy in some lung cancer patients Lydia Ramsey Oct. 10, 2016, 9:48 AM 16,341 facebook linkedin twitter email print In this 2011 image, tiny beads (yellow) are used to force T-cells to divide before they are given to leukemia patients. University of Pennsylvania via Microbe World / Flickr For people with advanced forms of lung cancer, chemotherapy might not be the only — or even the best — option.  The drug, marketed as Keytruda, is one of a new set of drugs called immunotherapy. The drug targets the programmed cell death 1 (or PD-1) receptor and allows the body's own immune system go after the cancer cells. Merck, the maker of Keytruda, just finished a new trial on the drug, for patients who haven't yet been treated for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The results are published in the New England Journal of Medicine, and were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology conference. About a third of all these patients with non-small cell lung cancer have cells that express at least 50% of this PD-L1 protein (which relates to the PD-1 receptor the drug is targeting).  The 305 patients who took part in the trial were either assigned Keytruda or platinum-based chemotherapy. Progression-free survival — a clinical endpoint that basically means the cancer hasn't grown — was a median of 10.3 months in those who received Keytruda, while those in the chemotherapy group had a median progression-free survival of 6 months. The overall survival rate at six months for those on Keytruda was 80.2%, while it was 72% for chemotherapy. "All these data taken together really represent a sea change in the treatment of the lung cancer patient," Merck's senior vice president of clinical development, Roy Baynes told Business Insider, referring to this trial, as well as another that looked at what happens when chemotherapy is combined with immunotherapy. This is the first randomized controlled trial to show that immunotherapy is better than standard chemotherapy as a first treatment for people with this type of lung cancer, he said. Steep competition Keytruda isn't the only PD-1 drug trying to prove it works for this group of lung cancer patients. In August, Bristol-Myers Squibb, a company with a competing drug called Opdivo said its version of the study didn't hit its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with at least 5% PD-L1 expression in tumors (a wider net than what Merck's was looking at). Bristol-Myers also presented data at the ESMO conference and fell short of expectations that it would at least do well in patients with high levels of PD-L1 protein. The company's stock was down 8% Monday morning, while Merck was up 2%.  Both Opdivo (nivolumab) and Keytruda (pembrolizumab) are approved for a seemingly ever-growing list of cancer types. And they're not cheap. Opdivo brought in $840 million in second-quarter sales alone, while Keytruda  made $314 million over the same time period. "It might well be that Keytruda monotherapy in high PDL1 expressers remains the go-to regimen, representing a high bar for combination therapy to cross," Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a note Friday, before the full data was released. But, although there is a lot of excitement over new immunotherapies like these two, there's still a lot that needs to be figured out about how these treatments work and who will respond to them.  "Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors will displace chemotherapy in yet another subset of patients with lung cancer," Dr. Bruce Johnson of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute wrote in an editorial published Sunday in NEJM. "We await the results of long-term follow-up of large cohorts of patients who were treated with another checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab, to see whether the initial survival data advantage in the population translates to survival of 20% or greater at 3 years and beyond."

Share this article UTRECHT, Netherlands, October 12, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Goal is to Make a Child-friendly Treatment for Schistosomiasis Accessible to Children Under Six Years of age in Endemic Countries UK-based Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI), part of Imperial College London, is reinforcing the international non-profit Pediatric Praziquantel Consortium. The aim of the Consortium is to develop, register and make available a new child-friendly praziquantel formulation for the more than 25 million preschool-age children suffering from schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease endemic in most of Sub-Saharan Africa. This age group currently lacks a suitable treatment. SCI, with their extensive expertise in working with Ministries of Health across sub-Saharan Africa for the control and potential elimination of schistosomiasis, will support the Consortium in preparing and implementing the Access and Delivery plan of the new pediatric formulation in endemic countries. Dr Elly Kourany Lefoll, Program Lead of the pediatric praziquantel development program and Head of Drug Development Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) at Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, comments: "We are very pleased that SCI joins our Consortium. Over the last four years, we've made important progresses across the pediatric praziquantel development program, with a phase II clinical trial currently being conducted in Ivory Coast. This means that we are now testing the new formulation in schistosome-infected pre-school age children to identify the optimal dose." If not treated properly, schistosomiasis results in high morbidity, including anemia, stunted growth and reduced learning ability. In some cases, the disease can even be fatal. "As we are advancing in our development program," Dr Kourany-Lefoll continues, "we have started to develop a plan to make the child- friendly praziquantel formulation accessible to children under six years of age in endemic countries. We are reaching out to access experts, and other key stakeholders, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and governmental representatives from Sub-Saharan African countries to gain their input and support. SCI will play a crucial role in this endeavor." For SCI this partnership opens up different opportunities. SCI's goal is to reduce the global disease burden of NTDs, including schistosomiasis, in sub-Saharan Africa by 2030 in accordance with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Professor Fenwick, SCI's founder and director, says, "We have been in contact with the Consortium for many years, and we look forward to this collaboration. We see the pediatric praziquantel formulation as a breakthrough in the battle against schistosomiasis in infected young children, a group lacking suitable treatment until now." He adds, "Apart from creating awareness, changing perceptions and fostering global support for NTD Programmes, at SCI, we also put great emphasis on ensuring universal access to effective treatment for everyone who suffers from NTDs." The know-how of SCI in deploying preventative and therapeutic tools and strategies to eliminate NTDs complements the existing scientific and regulatory expertise provided by the other six partners of the Consortium. Moreover, SCI has a broad network among policy makers such as the WHO, Ministries of Health, academic institutions, funders and other stakeholders which are key players in the implementation of an effective awareness and sensitization campaign in the coming years. Schistosomiasis (also known as bilharzia) is one of the most prevalent parasitic diseases in Africa and a very important one in terms of public health burden and economic impact. It is a poverty-related disease that leads to chronic illness. The threat posed by schistosomiasis is substantial, with 78 affected countries, 700 million people at risk and an estimated 258 million people infected. More than 90% of patients live in Africa, where the disease affects a large proportion of children under the age of 14. About the Pediatric Praziquantel Consortium  The Pediatric Praziquantel Consortium is an international not-for-profit partnership that aims to reduce the global disease burden of schistosomiasis by addressing the medical need of infected preschool-age children. Its mission is to develop, register and provide access to a suitable pediatric praziquantel formulation for treating schistosomiasis in this age group. The pediatric formulation under investigation has been designed to be smaller, exhibit an improved palatability and be orally dispersible compared to the current commercial formulation. The Consortium was established in July 2012 by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (Merck KGaA), Astellas Pharma Inc. (Astellas), Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) and Lygature (formerly TI Pharma). At the beginning of 2014, Farmanguinhos and Simcyp, a Certara company, joined the Consortium as full partners. The Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI), part of Imperial College London, joined in 2016. Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany leads the program and brings expertise and support related to praziquantel, including resources from different areas (drug product manufacturing, pre-clinical, clinical, regulatory) needed for clinical development and to efficiently execute the project. Astellas contributes by providing its innovative pharmaceutical technologies in the area of pediatric drug formulation development as well as clinical development in children. Swiss TPH brings extensive experience in helminths biological and pharmacological research, epidemiology and clinical research in endemic regions. The governance is facilitated by Lygature, a Dutch non-profit organization and independent party with an extensive portfolio of international public-private partnerships in drug research and development, including in the area of neglected diseases. Farmanguinhos, the federal governmental pharmaceutical laboratory of the Fiocruz Foundation in Brazil, brings unique expertise to produce and distribute the new pediatric formulations product in endemic countries. Simcyp, a Certara company, brings expertise in pharmacokinetic modelling for better predicting the appropriate dosage for use in the pediatric clinical trials. SCI, part of Imperial College London, provides the necessary expertise to define and execute the access strategy and plan as well as to initiate and implement NTD control and elimination programs in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Home Auto Gadgets Hardware Internet IT Science Software Blogs Polls Submit News Science Keytruda: A breakthrough treatment to increase survival rates for lung cancer patients Monique Bethell - October 12, 2016 5:00 AM Print Recipient E-mail Sender E-mail Lungs  (Source: Medscape.com) A novel immunotherapy offers a unique breakthrough toward the successful treatment for lung cancer patients. This weekend, Merck announced the results of two major studies showing Keytruda’s superior ability to slow the progression of advanced lung cancer and reduce risk of death by fifty percent (50%) at the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO). Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Chemotherapy is currently the standard of treatment in most patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which makes up about 80% of all cases of lung cancer. The problem is the survival rates remain low and the side effects are high. Study results announced at the ESMO and also published in the October 9th edition of The New England Journal of Medicine suggests that Merck’s Keytruda treatment can offer a “meaningful improvement” over standard chemotherapy treatments.     Based upon the results observed from two major clinical studies, KEYTRUDA also known as pembrolizumab, is the only anti-PD-1 to demonstrate superior progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of both squamous and non-squamous NSCLC in patients whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1 and whose tumors have not mutated or spread to other parts of the body.     Results of KEYNOTE-24, a clinical trial which studied Keytruda as a single therapy, compared to those who were treated with chemotherapy showed that it reduced the risk of disease progression by 50% and reduced the risk of death by 40%. Patients taking Keytruda also saw a 45% shrinkage of tumors compared to only 28% of patients on chemotherapy.   Another study, KEYNOTE-21 was conducted by researchers at the Hospital at the University of Pennsylvania, found 33 of the 60 patients who received both Keytruda, plus chemotherapy (carboplatin plus pemetrexed), responded to treatment, compared to 18 of 63 patients who received only chemotherapy, according to a statement from the company. Patients on combination therapy had an average progression-free survival of 12 months, compared to 8.9 months with the standard of care. The risk of disease progression or death was reduced by 47 percent.  Patients also had a longer period of time before their tumors started growing again.   How does it work?   Keytruda works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight cancer cells.  It blocks the PD-1 pathway and prevents the cancer cells from remaining hidden from the body’s natural immune defense system.   Photo Source:  Keytruda.com   Currently, Keytruda is approved as a second line of therapy for NSCLC patients who have tried chemotherapy and haven’t been successful. According to Bloomberg, Matthew Hellman, an oncologist specializing in lung cancer from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, notes that the combination of Keytruda with chemotherapy is “a welcome addition to the field”, although more testing with larger sample sizes is needed in order to draw stronger conclusions.       The FDA also approved Keytruda for patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer. The addition of treatment Keytruda for NCSLC presents another major step forward in the advancement for treatment of this disease. According to Merck, this discovery could significantly increase the market share of Keytruda to an even wider population.         "What would I do?

The aim of the Consortium is to develop, register and make available a new child-friendly praziquantel formulation for the more than 25 million preschool-age children suffering from schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease endemic in most of Sub-Saharan Africa. This age group currently lacks a suitable treatment. SCI, with their extensive expertise in working with Ministries of Health across sub-Saharan Africa for the control and potential elimination of schistosomiasis, will support the Consortium in preparing and implementing the Access and Delivery plan of the new pediatric formulation in endemic countries. Dr Elly Kourany Lefoll, Program Lead of the pediatric praziquantel development program and Head of Drug Development Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) at Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, comments: "We are very pleased that SCI joins our Consortium. Over the last four years, we've made important progresses across the pediatric praziquantel development program, with a phase II clinical trial currently being conducted in Ivory Coast. This means that we are now testing the new formulation in schistosome-infected pre-school age children to identify the optimal dose." If not treated properly, schistosomiasis results in high morbidity, including anemia, stunted growth and reduced learning ability. In some cases, the disease can even be fatal. "As we are advancing in our development program," Dr Kourany-Lefoll continues, "we have started to develop a plan to make the child- friendly praziquantel formulation accessible to children under six years of age in endemic countries. We are reaching out to access experts, and other key stakeholders, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and governmental representatives from Sub-Saharan African countries to gain their input and support. SCI will play a crucial role in this endeavor." For SCI this partnership opens up different opportunities. SCI's goal is to reduce the global disease burden of NTDs, including schistosomiasis, in sub-Saharan Africa by 2030 in accordance with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Professor Fenwick, SCI's founder and director, says, "We have been in contact with the Consortium for many years, and we look forward to this collaboration. We see the pediatric praziquantel formulation as a breakthrough in the battle against schistosomiasis in infected young children, a group lacking suitable treatment until now." He adds, "Apart from creating awareness, changing perceptions and fostering global support for NTD Programmes, at SCI, we also put great emphasis on ensuring universal access to effective treatment for everyone who suffers from NTDs." The know-how of SCI in deploying preventative and therapeutic tools and strategies to eliminate NTDs complements the existing scientific and regulatory expertise provided by the other six partners of the Consortium. Moreover, SCI has a broad network among policy makers such as the WHO, Ministries of Health, academic institutions, funders and other stakeholders which are key players in the implementation of an effective awareness and sensitization campaign in the coming years. Schistosomiasis (also known as bilharzia) is one of the most prevalent parasitic diseases in Africa and a very important one in terms of public health burden and economic impact. It is a poverty-related disease that leads to chronic illness. The threat posed by schistosomiasis is substantial, with 78 affected countries, 700 million people at risk and an estimated 258 million people infected. More than 90% of patients live in Africa, where the disease affects a large proportion of children under the age of 14. About the Pediatric Praziquantel Consortium The Pediatric Praziquantel Consortium is an international not-for-profit partnership that aims to reduce the global disease burden of schistosomiasis by addressing the medical need of infected preschool-age children. Its mission is to develop, register and provide access to a suitable pediatric praziquantel formulation for treating schistosomiasis in this age group. The pediatric formulation under investigation has been designed to be smaller, exhibit an improved palatability and be orally dispersible compared to the current commercial formulation. The Consortium was established in July 2012 by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (Merck KGaA), Astellas Pharma Inc. (Astellas), Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) and Lygature (formerly TI Pharma). At the beginning of 2014, Farmanguinhos and Simcyp, a Certara company, joined the Consortium as full partners. The Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI), part of Imperial College London, joined in 2016. Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany leads the program and brings expertise and support related to praziquantel, including resources from different areas (drug product manufacturing, pre-clinical, clinical, regulatory) needed for clinical development and to efficiently execute the project. Astellas contributes by providing its innovative pharmaceutical technologies in the area of pediatric drug formulation development as well as clinical development in children. Swiss TPH brings extensive experience in helminths biological and pharmacological research, epidemiology and clinical research in endemic regions. The governance is facilitated by Lygature, a Dutch non-profit organization and independent party with an extensive portfolio of international public-private partnerships in drug research and development, including in the area of neglected diseases. Farmanguinhos, the federal governmental pharmaceutical laboratory of the Fiocruz Foundation in Brazil, brings unique expertise to produce and distribute the new pediatric formulations product in endemic countries. Simcyp, a Certara company, brings expertise in pharmacokinetic modelling for better predicting the appropriate dosage for use in the pediatric clinical trials.

This research report also lists several other prominent vendors that are expected to impact the market during the forecast period. Special regulatory designations will act as a major boost for the global metabolic disorders therapeutics market. These special designations help vendors launch their drugs quickly into the market. Also, in a few cases, governments offer tax incentives for such drugs. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave the orphan drug designation for a few already approved drugs such as Elelyso, Zavesca, and Cerezyme. Regulatory bodies, at times, give these designations to pipeline products. For instance, Amicus Therapeutics' migalastat is under regulatory review in the US. However, the drug received orphan designation from the FDA for Fabry disease in June 2016. Competitive vendor landscape Novo Nordisk dominated the global metabolic disorders therapeutics market in 2015, primarily because of the high revenues obtained from the diabetes drugs segment. The dominant drugs of the company are Levemir, NovoRapid/NovoLog, NovoMix/NovoLog Mix, and Victoza, which together accounted for the sales of USD 10.14 billion in 2015. The company focuses mainly on diabetes, obesity, hemophilia, and growth hormone disorders. The sales in diabetes and obesity care products increased by 22% in 2015, when measured in Danish Krone (DKK). "Sanofi holds the second position in the metabolic disorders therapeutics market, particularly the diabetes drugs market owing to the high performance of Lantus, which remains the world's best-selling insulin brand, both in terms of volume and value. The sales of Lantus represented over 17% of the total net sales of the company in 2015," says Barath Palada, a lead cardiovascular and metabolic disorders analyst from Technavio. Merck has captured the third position in the global metabolic disorder therapeutics market owing to its prominent position in diabetes and hypercholesterolemia drugs market. Januvia and Janumet are the leading diabetes drugs offered by the company, the combined sales of which accounted to USD 6.01 billion in 2015. Also, the presence of pipeline products is expected to foster the growth of this segment further.

Top five metabolic disorders therapeutics market vendors Novo Nordisk The company is engaged in research, development, manufacturing and marketing of insulin products, GLP-1 and associated delivery systems, oral antidiabetic products (OAD) and obesity drugs. In FY2015, the revenue increased by 9% compared to that in 2014. The increase was because of the growth in performance of Victoza (Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 therapy for type 2 diabetes) and insulin and protein related products (Treshiba, Ryzodeg, and modern insulin). However, it was partially offset by the decrease in sales of oral antidiabetic products (Novonorm, Prandin, and Prandimet). Sanofi The company is engaged in research, development, and marketing of various therapeutic solutions and healthcare products. The revenue generated from the sales of the other products in the diabetes segment amounted to USD 8.41 billion in 2015. The various products included under the diabetes segment are Lantus, Amaryl, Apidra, Insuman, and Lyxumia. The sales in the diabetes segment declined by USD 550.2 billion in 2015. Apart from this, Toujeo was approved by the US FDA in February 2015 and by the EMA in April 2015. Merck Merck offers type 2 diabetes drugs through its pharmaceutical segment. The company has an established presence in the diabetes market with offerings such as Januvia and Janumet. In June 2015, the company presented Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin study results at the 2015 American Diabetes Association meeting. AstraZeneca The company offers a wide range of products for the treatment of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The key products for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases include Atacand1/Atacand HCT/Atacand Plus, Brilinta/Brilique, Crestor, Plendil, Seloken/Toprol-XL, Tenormin, and Zestril. Eli Lilly Eli Lilly has an established presence in the diabetes market with its range of offerings. It offers diabetes drugs through its endocrinology segment. The key products include Trulicity, Jardiance, Abasaglar (Basaglar), Humalog, Humulin, Trajenta, Jentadueto, and Glyxambi.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Lung cancer treatment is moving beyond chemotherapy, with Merck & Co. setting the pace in a new category of therapies that harness the body’s immune system to fight tumors.  The U.S. drugmaker’s Keytruda medicine reduced the risk of death or cancer progression by 50 percent, Merck said, unveiling details of a crucial study at a meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology. The medicine gave patients an average of 10.3 months before their cancer progressed, compared with six months on chemotherapy. Unlike competitor Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., whose similar drug Opdivo failed in an advanced trial and caused its stock to plunge, Merck selected patients who harbored high levels of a protein thought to predict how well the immune-system drugs will work. The results give Merck a head start -- and not just on Bristol-Myers. Roche Holding AG and AstraZeneca Plc are also in the race for the best new immune therapy against lung tumors, the most common cancer in the world.  While Merck and Bristol-Myers are the leaders, each of the four companies will probably be able to take a piece of the market as data emerges from single and combination therapies for patients with various levels of the predictive protein, said Mirjam Heeb, who helps manage $186 million in health-care stocks, including Bristol-Myers, Roche and Merck, at GAM Holding AG in Zurich. “We can assume now that Merck has a lead of at least 12 months” in its target patient group, Heeb said in a telephone interview. “But the overall landscape is changing so fast that I think it’s impossible to predict what it will look like in 12 months.” Doctors will probably start testing patients soon after diagnosis to see whether they’re suited to treatment with Keytruda and can forgo the many side effects of chemotherapy, said Stefan Zimmermann, a chief oncologist at the Cantonal Hospital of Fribourg, Switzerland. “The main reaction will actually be relief and renewed hope,” Zimmermann said on Sunday from the meeting in Copenhagen. “We have been waiting for ways to ditch the good old chemotherapy that carries significant toxicity.” Shares of Merck, which have gained 19 percent this year, rose 3 percent in trading before the opening of U.S. markets, while Bristol-Myers fell 6.1 percent, adding to a 19 percent decline this year. AstraZeneca fell 0.4 percent at 12:31 p.m. in London, and Roche rose 0.4 percent in Zurich. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is set to decide by Dec. 24 whether Keytruda, already approved for patients whose lung cancer got worse after chemotherapy, can be used as an initial treatment too. Some 224,000 Americans will probably be diagnosed with lung tumors this year, according to the National Cancer Institute. Much of the battle for dominance in lung immune-oncology drugs thus far has centered on whether patients need to show high levels of a protein called PD-L1 to benefit. Merck’s trial focused on patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 at least half the time. That group could comprise as many as one-quarter of newly-diagnosed lung-cancer patients, said Sam Fazeli, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. By contrast, Bristol-Myers’s competing therapy, Opdivo, failed a test as a sole treatment for lung cancer after the company included patients with lower levels of PD-L1. But details of the trial unveiled at the conference pointed to lackluster results even in a narrower group of patients with high PD-L1 levels. “PD-L1 assessment has to be part of the standard diagnostic workup,” said Corey Langer, director of the thoracic oncology program at the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania. “Patients can’t wait for these results.” Langer led a smaller trial of Merck’s Keytruda also presented in Copenhagen, which combined the drug with chemotherapy and also let in all patients, no matter their PD-L1 levels. The combination was almost twice as successful at shrinking lung cancer tumors than a standard chemotherapy regimen. But with just 123 patients, the trial was too small to say for sure whether the combination is better than immune therapy alone, Langer said. Roche also presented results showing its immune therapy contender, Tecentriq, helped patients whose lung tumors had already progressed. Tecentriq was approved by regulators in May for advanced bladder cancer, and Roche expects a ruling from the FDA in second-line lung cancer by the end of next week. Results for newly-diagnosed patients aren’t expected before 2018, however. By then, Fazeli said, investors will be focusing on combination therapies. The first results from two immune therapies used together will probably come next year from AstraZeneca. Bristol-Myers is also working on such a combination, with data due out in 2018. Like Merck, Roche is combining its immune-oncology drug with chemotherapy, aiming for approval in 2018. “Given the data you see here with Keytruda alone, the combinations should by logic and by data seem to do better,” Fazeli said.   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News.

Bristol-Myers should make a case to get Opdivo paid for by the Cancer Drugs Fund, which covers new therapies while information is collected on how well they work in practice, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, known as NICE, said in an e-mailed statement. The medicine’s potential should be explored in patients with certain levels of a protein involved in immune response to cancer, according to the statement, a draft of recommendations to the state-run National Health Service. “We do not have the full picture yet and we need more evidence to find out the extent of this benefit” in patients whose protein levels indicate the drug will work best, Carole Longson, director of the health technology evaluation center at NICE, said in the statement. Bristol-Myers, based in New York, has lost about a quarter of its market value this year as study results threw into question whether Opdivo can help lung-cancer patients who’ve just been diagnosed. Meanwhile, Merck & Co.’s rival treatment Keytruda reduced the risk of death or cancer progression by 50 percent in a study, giving Merck a head start on all of its competitors in the race for the best new immune therapy against lung tumors. NICE said last week that Keytruda isn’t cost-effective, even with a discount on price, and shouldn’t be covered by the Cancer Drugs Fund. Bristol-Myers also offered an undisclosed discount on Opdivo, whose price is 439 pounds ($536) for a 40-milligram vial, according to NICE. Exact treatment costs depend on a person’s weight and type of lung cancer. Opdivo is given intravenously every two weeks and targets a protein called PD-L1. NICE suggested that coverage through the Cancer Drugs Fund would allow study and access to the drug in patients with PD-L1 levels of 10 percent or more on their cancer cells.

Oct. 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- OncoSec Medical Incorporated ("OncoSec") (NASDAQ: ONCS), a company developing DNA-based intratumoral cancer immunotherapies, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended July 31, 2016. "During the fourth quarter, we continued to advance the development of our lead clinical program, ImmunoPulse® IL-12, focused on the anti-PD1 non-responsive patient population in melanoma. The development of ImmunoPulse® IL-12 in combination with an anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor represents a potential immunotherapy for melanoma patients that are progressing on anti-PD1 therapy," noted Punit Dhillon, President and Chief Executive Officer.  "We have enrolled over 20 patients in our Phase II combination clinical study of ImmunoPulse® IL-12 with Merck's KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in melanoma patients that are considered non-responders to anti-PD1, and OncoSec remains on track to announce interim data from approximately 15 of these patients at a three-month follow-up later this quarter.  Subject to these interim results and discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, we expect to submit a registration directed study design for ImmunoPulse® IL-12 by the end of 2016.  We have also continued to expand our research pipeline and broaden our engineering efforts relating to new devices that will be launched with our next clinical candidate. We look forward to discussing research and pre-clinical updates and timing data and clinical development milestones relating to our Melanoma program on our conference call and webcast on October 13th." FINANCIAL RESULTS   For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016, OncoSec reported a net loss of $6.6 million and $26.9 million, or $0.39 per share and $1.63 per share, respectively, compared to a net loss of $6.5 million and $21.2 million, or $0.48 per share and $1.67 per share, respectively, for the same period last year. The increase in net loss for the year ended July 31, 2016, compared with the same period in 2015, resulted primarily from (i) the progression of its clinical trials, (ii) consulting services costs to support its device development and clinical activities, (iii) facility costs related to its new corporate headquarters, and (iv) stock-based compensation expense. There were no revenues for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2016 or July 31, 2015. Research and development expenses were $3.7 million and $14.8 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016, respectively, compared to $3.8 million and $13.1 million for the same periods in 2015. General and administrative expenses were $2.9 million and $12.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016, compared to $2.7 million and $8.1 million for the same period in 2015. At July 31, 2016, OncoSec had $28.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, as compared to $32.0 million of cash and cash equivalents at July 31, 2015. OncoSec expects these funds to be sufficient to allow it to continue to operate its business for at least the next 12 months.

This could be an ambitious target in a highly competitive market led by multinationals  GlaxoSmithKline and Reckitt Benckiser, and domestic household names like Dabur and Emami. But with Rs 15,000 crore in cash and investments on the books of Piramal Enterprises, competition is watching the moves of Nandini Piramal carefully. Piramal scion is directly responsible for growth of this business. As an executive director, she also oversees the larger health care portfolio of the company, including contract manufacturing and critical care businesses. She has already made six acquisitions for the health care business in the past two years, putting Rs 1,800 crore to work. Three of these were made in the OTC business. This includes baby care products from Little’s, which helped it in getting into a new segment. Besides, it acquired four gastro-intestinal products from Merck to complement its existing portfolio. It also acquired five legacy brands from Pfizer, including Waterbury’s Compound and pain reliever Sloan’s. Nandini could be repeating what father Ajay Piramal did earlier. He bought Nicholas Laboratories in 1988, when it was ranked 48th in the domestic market and turned it into third largest company through a series of acquisitions. In 2010, he sold the domestic formulation part of the business to Abbott for $3.8 billion (Rs 17,500 crore), but retained the OTC, critical care and contract manufacturing businesses. Nandini could not have missed the lessons of value creation her father is known for delivering. Ajay Piramal continues to provide guidance as chairman of the company. “We are ready for acquisitions — big and small,” said Nandini Piramal, saying being in the top three is only a short-term goal. “The OTC market is fragmented. There are big brands in a few categories but we believe there is a lot of room to play.” With an unparalleled war-chest, investment bankers have made a beeline to her office. But, acquisition is not the growth strategy. The company is getting into new product categories as well. It launched an anti-allergy product, StopAllerG, first such in the category. It also launched Quikkool (mouth ulcer cream) or Throatsil (throat pain spray). The company has planned several extensions for each of these brands with the aim to make them among the top two players in their respective categories. The company started its independent OTC business in 2007 and made two acquisitions — contraceptive i-pill in 2011 and skin allergy lotion Caladryl in 2013. Its biggest brand is oral analgesic Saridon, with annual sales of Rs 131 crore. OTC is currently the smallest segment in its pharma portfolio with annual sales of Rs 393 crore in 2015-16. The company’s health care business, spread across three lines reported, Rs 3,558-crore revenue in the period, a compound annual growth rate of 17 per cent for five years. The company operates in the self-care segment of the OTC market, pegged at Rs 12, 000 crore and growing at 12-13 per cent annually. The company says it is seventh biggest in the business. According to India Brand Equity Foundation, OTC is 21 per cent of the $20-billion pharmaceutical industry in India. Nandini might not have an easy ride in this segment, as other heavyweights like Sun Pharmaceutical are also eyeing the OTC market with a greater focus. India’s most valued pharma company has top-selling OTC brands such as health supplement Revital and painkiller Volini. These products became a part of Sun Pharmaceutical’s portfolio after it acquired Ranbaxy two years ago. With the strength of popular brands in its kitty, the company has increased its focus on the segment by introducing new products for this segment. In June, it re-launched  dermatology prescription drug Suncros as a sunscreen product under OTC. Another domestic rival, Cipla, spun off its consumer health business to Cipla Health, a joint venture subsidiary with private equity firm Eight Roads Ventures India. It is now aiming to build five Rs 100-crore brands in five years by tapping into the growing health and wellness consciousness among urban population. “For long, the OTC segment was largely dominated by multinational corporations. But with increasing competition in the branded generics space, Indian companies are also getting aggressive in the OTC space now,” said Sriram Shrinivasan, partner and global leader for generics, EY.

This could be an ambitious target in a highly competitive market led by multinationals  GlaxoSmithKline and Reckitt Benckiser, and domestic household names like Dabur and Emami. But with Rs 15,000 crore in cash and investments on the books of Piramal Enterprises, competition is watching the moves of Nandini Piramal carefully. Piramal scion is directly responsible for growth of this business. As an executive director, she also oversees the larger health care portfolio of the company, including contract manufacturing and critical care businesses. She has already made six acquisitions for the health care business in the past two years, putting Rs 1,800 crore to work. Three of these were made in the OTC business. This includes baby care products from Little’s, which helped it in getting into a new segment. Besides, it acquired four gastro-intestinal products from Merck to complement its existing portfolio. It also acquired five legacy brands from Pfizer, including Waterbury’s Compound and pain reliever Sloan’s. Nandini could be repeating what father Ajay Piramal did earlier. He bought Nicholas Laboratories in 1988, when it was ranked 48th in the domestic market and turned it into third largest company through a series of acquisitions. In 2010, he sold the domestic formulation part of the business to Abbott for $3.8 billion (Rs 17,500 crore), but retained the OTC, critical care and contract manufacturing businesses. Nandini could not have missed the lessons of value creation her father is known for delivering. Ajay Piramal continues to provide guidance as chairman of the company. “We are ready for acquisitions — big and small,” said Nandini Piramal, saying being in the top three is only a short-term goal. “The OTC market is fragmented. There are big brands in a few categories but we believe there is a lot of room to play.” With an unparalleled war-chest, investment bankers have made a beeline to her office. But, acquisition is not the growth strategy. The company is getting into new product categories as well. It launched an anti-allergy product, StopAllerG, first such in the category. It also launched Quikkool (mouth ulcer cream) or Throatsil (throat pain spray). The company has planned several extensions for each of these brands with the aim to make them among the top two players in their respective categories. The company started its independent OTC business in 2007 and made two acquisitions — contraceptive i-pill in 2011 and skin allergy lotion Caladryl in 2013. Its biggest brand is oral analgesic Saridon, with annual sales of Rs 131 crore. OTC is currently the smallest segment in its pharma portfolio with annual sales of Rs 393 crore in 2015-16. The company’s health care business, spread across three lines reported, Rs 3,558-crore revenue in the period, a compound annual growth rate of 17 per cent for five years. The company operates in the self-care segment of the OTC market, pegged at Rs 12, 000 crore and growing at 12-13 per cent annually. The company says it is seventh biggest in the business. According to India Brand Equity Foundation, OTC is 21 per cent of the $20-billion pharmaceutical industry in India. Nandini might not have an easy ride in this segment, as other heavyweights like Sun Pharmaceutical are also eyeing the OTC market with a greater focus. India’s most valued pharma company has top-selling OTC brands such as health supplement Revital and painkiller Volini. These products became a part of Sun Pharmaceutical’s portfolio after it acquired Ranbaxy two years ago. With the strength of popular brands in its kitty, the company has increased its focus on the segment by introducing new products for this segment. In June, it re-launched  dermatology prescription drug Suncros as a sunscreen product under OTC. Another domestic rival, Cipla, spun off its consumer health business to Cipla Health, a joint venture subsidiary with private equity firm Eight Roads Ventures India. It is now aiming to build five Rs 100-crore brands in five years by tapping into the growing health and wellness consciousness among urban population. “For long, the OTC segment was largely dominated by multinational corporations. But with increasing competition in the branded generics space, Indian companies are also getting aggressive in the OTC space now,” said Sriram Shrinivasan, partner and global leader for generics, EY.

Investor sentiment took a hard hit after the release of the weaker than expected Chinese trade report. The disappointing data sparked concerns among traders over the health of the global economy. Mining stocks were under pressure after the weak Chinese trade report. Financial stocks and automakers were also among the decliners. Technology stocks also extended the weakness of the previous session, after yesterday's warning from Ericsson. China's exports declined more than expected in September reflecting subdued global demand, data from the General Administration of Customs revealed Thursday. Exports dropped notably by 10 percent in September from prior year, much bigger than the expected fall of 3.3 percent. Shipment had declined 2.8 percent in August. At the same time, imports slid 1.9 percent annually, confounding expectations for an increase of 0.9 percent and reversing a 1.5 percent rise in August, which was the first increase in almost two years. As a result, the trade surplus narrowed to $42 billion compared to the expected level of $53 billion. The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index weakened by 0.88 percent. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks decreased 1.10 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which includes some major U.K. companies, lost 0.98 percent. The DAX of Germany dropped 1.04 percent and the CAC 40 of France fell 1.06 percent. The FTSE 100 of the U.K. declined 0.66 percent and the SMI of Switzerland finished lower by 0.85 percent. In Frankfurt, drug maker Merck KgaA dipped 0.25 percent after it said it firmly believes it will meet the objectives set for 2018. The company said it has focused pharmaceutical pipeline and continuously developed it further. Deutsche Bank surrendered 3.12 percent, after the U.S. SEC announced that the lender has agreed to pay a $9.5 million penalty for failing to properly safeguard material nonpublic information generated by its research analysts. Commerzbank also forfeited 4.20 percent. Volkswagen decreased 1.33 percent and Daimler fell 1.53 percent. BMW also finished lower by 1.56 percent. In Paris, Casino Group reported 2.9 percent sales quarter on an organic basis for its third quarter. Same store sales were up 1.7 percent. The stock dropped 2.11 percent. BNP Paribas dropped 2.90 percent and Credit Agricole weakened by 3.22 percent. Societe Generale also finished down by 3.04 percent. Peugeot fell 2.27 percent and Renault lost 1.89 percent. In London, Unilever declined 3.53 percent after it said its third-quarter total turnover were 13.4 billion euros, down 0.1 percent due to a negative currency impact. Sales increased by 3.4% at constant exchange rates, while underlying sales growth was 3.2 percent. Meanwhile, U.K. supermarket chain Tesco announced that it has pulled dozens of household products supplied by Unilever from its online shopping site over pricing and a weaker pound. Tesco decreased 3.03 percent. Standard Life weakened by 5.07 percent after it was downgraded by Barclays to 'Underweight' from 'Equal weight.' Mining stocks were under pressure due to the weak Chinese trade report. Anglo American dropped 4.80 percent and Rio Tinto fell 4.86 percent. BHP Billiton declined 4.40 percent and Antofagasta lost 3.05 percent. German consumer price inflation accelerated to a 16-month high in September, final data from Destatis showed Thursday. Consumer prices advanced 0.7 percent year-on-year in September, in line with flash estimate and faster than the 0.4 percent increase seen in prior month. The latest inflation figure was the highest since May 2015, when it was at the same level. House prices in the United Kingdom picked up steam in September, the latest survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors showed on Thursday with an index score of +17. That's up from +13 in August and the three-year low of +5 in July. That reading immediately followed the Brexit vote and capped five straight months of decline. First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits held steady in the week ended October 8th, the Labor Department revealed in a report on Thursday. The Labor Department said initial jobless claims came in at 246,000, unchanged from the previous week's revised level. Economists had expected jobless claims to climb to 254,000 from the 249,000 originally reported for the previous week. Import prices in the U.S. saw a modest uptick in the month of September, according to a report released by the Labor Department on Thursday. The report said import prices inched up by 0.1 percent in September after falling by 0.2 percent in August. The uptick in prices matched economist estimates. The Labor Department also said export prices rose by 0.3 percent in September following a 0.8 percent drop in August. Export prices had been expected to edge up by 0.1 percent.

It’s been the worst performer so far in 2016, and it looks like it will continue to move still lower in the coming weeks. The weakness in the sector is pervasive, hitting all subgroups, but drug stocks seem to be technically poised for a serious decline. I’ve noticed a pattern in some of the biggest drug stocks, specifically Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK), where they trade near their 52-week highs in a tight range or rectangle pattern, break out on news and then fail badly. Pfizer did this in July and has been falling ever since. Merck, on the other hand, broke out and failed just this week, so the jury is still out on that one. A lesser-known drug stock is currently exhibiting the same pattern as Pfizer and Merck, which could result in a nice profit for short sellers. Zoetis Inc (ZTS), which focuses on drugs and vaccines for pets and livestock, was actually spun off from Pfizer in 2013, so there’s not a lot of history for chartists to ponder. But the short-term pattern of range, breakout and failure is quite clear, as is the break below the rising trendline drawn from March of this year. [More from StreetAuthority.com: This Stock Is One Bad Day Away From A Breakdown] Specific news events preceded Pfizer and Merck’s reversals. But while Zoetis does not have a major news event, it has something its larger peers did not: falling cumulative volume ahead of its peak. 10 Stocks That Every Investor Should Own Cumulative or on-balance volume is a measure of volume changing hands on up days versus down days. Theoretically, it tells us whether bulls or bears are more aggressive, and, most of the time, it mirrors price action. When the two diverge, we get a good signal that the trend is about to change. With Zoetis, cumulative volume has been falling while shares have been rising. This tells us the bears are selling, distributing their shares to supposedly weaker hands. Supply goes up, demand goes down, and that typically leads to a decline in price. [More from StreetAuthority.com: Why This Scandalized Bank Is A Contrarian’s Dream] With Tuesday’s big decline, Zoetis has already broken down below its 50-day moving average, ahead of its larger cousins during their patterns. However, ZTS bounced off the bottom of its two-month range, so traders should be aware that there is support at the $50 level. There was unusual options activity at the $50 strike as well. Given the stock’s failure to hold its breakout and the weak overall condition of the healthcare sector, it seems the writing is on the wall here. Conservative traders may want to wait for a break below $50 support to sell given Tuesday’s large drop. However, more aggressive traders can sell shares short now and add to their positions on a break below the $50 level. Apple Inc. (AAPL): The Luckiest D*mn Company on Earth The next important support is around $45.50, which is near the June lows, and that seems to be a compelling downside target.

X Samsung’s Note 7 recall biggest in history but not the worst Cars, peanuts and medication have done more damage to company reputations Thu, Oct 13, 2016, 12:52 On a 10-point scale measuring financial and reputational damage to a company, Samsung’s Note 7 recall ranks between four and seven, said an expert. Photograph: Brian Green/Reuters         Samsung’s recall of its fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 smartphone will be one of the biggest recalls ever in the technology industry. The South Korean conglomerate pulled the plug on the entire product line and slashed its third-quarter profit forecast by $2.3 billion (€2.1 billion). On a 10-point scale measuring financial and reputational damage to a company, Samsung’s recall ranks between four and seven, said Srinivas Reddy, director of the Centre for Marketing Excellence at Singapore Management University, who has researched product and brand failures. That’s because the exploding phones – while still “a calamity” for the company – have not killed anyone, Reddy said. “The threat for Samsung is how soon they can get back,” Reddy said. “If they don’t get back soon, it provides a vacuum for others to creep in.” Notorious recalls In a marketplace where everything from cars to cows can have deadly defects, Samsung’s product failure is far from the worst in history. Merck’s 2004 scandal with its drug Vioxx – which studies showed could increase the chance of heart attacks and strokes in some patients – was a “catastrophic disaster,” rating a 10 on Reddy’s scale. Payouts from lawsuits and government investigations tallied more than $8.5 billion. Other notorious recalls include: Some versions of Ford Motor Co’s Pinto compact car first introduced in 1971 came with a fatal design flaw – impacts to the rear of the vehicle could cause fuel leaks and explosions. Ford recalled about 1.5 million Pintos in 1978 amid a US government investigation and criminal charges in the state of Indiana. Ford shut down Pinto production soon thereafter. The largest car-related recall in history is yet to be completed and could result in bankruptcy with billions of dollars in costs. Takata’s airbags were meant to save lives in the event of a crash. Instead, the defective products became deadly cannon that shot shards of materials at passengers – at least 16 people have died in relation to the product. ADVERTISEMENT Food staples such as chicken, beef and peanut butter have been recalled because of mistakes or unhygienic conditions in manufacturing processes. Peanut Corp of America used the nut in more than 800 products that were tainted with salmonella in 2009. The result was nine deaths, more than 700 illnesses and one of the biggest recalls in US history. The company collapsed and the former chief executive officer was sentenced to prison. Even medicines taken to ease pain have proven to be fatal. In 1982, Johnson and Johnson recalled about 31 million bottles of Tylenol after seven people in the Chicago area died from swallowing cyanide-spiked capsules. Some of the highest-profile cases have involved children. Mattel recalled about 21 million Chinese-made toys, including those based on characters from Sesame Street and Dora the Explorer, after they were found to contain more than 180 times the allowable levels of lead paint. If ingested by children, lead can cause brain damage, learning problems and even death.       Topics: Srinivas Reddy Center For Marketing Excellence Singapore Management University Us Government Ford Motor Johnson Merck Peanut Samsung Chicago Indiana United States Read More Irish plane passengers warned not to use Samsung phones Samsung updates Irish customers on Note 7 options Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy Pound raises cost of Britain’s EU budget contribution Retail & Services Irish shoppers should rise up over UK retailers’ levy International Gerry Thornley: Focus returns to showdown with All Blacks Business Sensors help police curb gang violence in Cape Town Sponsored My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa Power up your company's pension plan Designed for life: Helen James on creativity and a life InSync ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Lansdowne Road deal needs correction, says union chief 21:32 Councils losing revenue due to rates assessment backlog 20:28 The big business events coming up in the week ahead 19:12 In the news: Arnotts’ bumper year and Clare crematorium 18:09 Pound raises cost of Britain’s EU budget contribution 17:27 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Could sleep problems be a thing of the past with Sense?

Is Hillary Clinton bad news for drug stocks? Posted on Wednesday, October 12, 2016 by CNN in Business News Looking for another sign that Hillary Clinton appears to have momentum over Donald Trump in the U.S presidential race? Check out healthcare stocks, specifically big drugmakers and biotechs. Clinton has promised to tackle the problem of high drug prices numerous times on the campaign trail — in speeches and in a series of tweets. And pharmaceutical companies have typically taken a hit following her tough talk. The recent controversy surrounding rising prices for the EpiPen allergy medication in late August has brought the issue of drug prices back to the forefront. Clinton attacked EpiPen maker Mylan in a tweet, saying there was “no justification” for the price hikes. The iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals exchange-traded fund, which includes Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Merck and Mylan as top holdings, is down more than 5% since that tweet. Meanwhile, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF, which owns Biogen, Gilead Sciences and Amgen, has plunged 7% in the past month and a half. The EpiPen tweet echoes another one by Clinton from September 2015, when Martin Shkreli became a household name for the more than 5,000% price increase of the HIV and malaria treatment Daraprim by his company Turing Pharmaceuticals. Clinton called that price hike “outrageous.” Biotech stocks (and Shkreli) wound up getting taken to the woodshed as a result. The sell-off in healthcare stocks is one of several market indicators that appear to be pointing to a victory over Trump next month. CNNMoney is also tracking the prices of gold and gasoline, as well as the value of the Mexican peso, to try and gauge what investors are thinking about the election. But should drug stock investors really be that nervous about a Hillary Clinton presidency? After all, many investors were initially scared about the impact that President Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, would have on the sector. However, leading health insurer UnitedHealth has soared more than 300% since the law went into effect in March 2010. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF, which includes top drug, biotech, medical equipment and insurers, is up nearly 120% too. That’s better than the overall market. So Obamacare didn’t exactly kill the industry. Along those lines, Martin Small, the head of U.S. ETFs for BlackRock-owned iShares, wrote in a recent report that the dip in healthcare ETFs lately may be an overreaction. “The sector appears to be taking a ‘breather’ during the uncertainties of the U.S. election season,” Small wrote. Still, investors may be growing worried about the possibility of Democrats winning control of at least one, if not both, of the two chambers of Congress now that Trump’s campaign seems to be going off the rails (on a crazy train?) The likelihood of major legislation that could hurt the big drugmakers and biotechs is higher if Democrats control the White House and legislative branch. It’s still not clear if the turmoil in the GOP will actually lead to a Democratic sweep next month though. And even if it does, experts point to an increased appetite for healthcare mergers as another reason why the industry could continue to thrive. Pfizer announced earlier this year it was scooping up cancer drugmaker Medivation, while Abbott Labs is buying medical equipment giant St. Jude.

(POL), a provider of specialized polymer materials, services and solutions, Wednesday announced that it is collaborating with German drug maker Merck KgaA (MKGAY.PK) to launch IM3D, a new technology enabling manufacturers to realize extraordinary 3D imagery on packaging and consumer electronics. With IM3D technology, manufacturers can create surfaces that appear to have depth and structure, although they are perfectly flat. At present, the 3D impression is created in just a single step during the injection molding process, compared to previous method of several processing steps. The striking effect turns packaging components, such as covers and wrappers, as well as polymer housings into distinctive eye-catchers. The company noted that IM3D decoration technology can be incorporated into standard injection molding machine production lines. The technology is made possible by combining Merck KGaA's expertise in development of pigments with the color concentrate formulation expertise of PolyOne.

BR America       中文       Deutsch       Français       日本語       ChinAfrica Search      Subscribe Home      Nation      World      Business      Opinion      Lifestyle      Multimedia      Documents      Special Reports      Africa Travel Nation Battling Cancer Young women on the Chinese mainland will gain access to HPV vaccine By Cui Xiaoqin | NO. 40-41 OCTOBER 6   The China Women's Development Foundation launches a health program for women and newborn infants in Beijing on May 5 (XINHUA) Landing in Hong Kong after a three-hour flight from Beijing last November, Liu Ran rushed over to the Dr. Vio & Partners Hospital. It was her third visit in six months. Sitting in the waiting room, travel-weary Liu along with several friends, also from the Chinese mainland, were ready to receive their next human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. The virus has been found to be the main cause of cervical cancer. Soon, however, young women on the Chinese mainland will not have to travel to Hong Kong anymore for the vaccine. British company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) announced on July 18 that its HPV vaccine Cervarix has obtained marketing authorization from the China Food and Drug Administration, becoming the first approved HPV vaccine on the Chinese mainland. The vaccine, expected to reach the market early next year, will help prevent cervical cancer in young females aged 9 to 25. A long wait In 2006, Gardasil, the world's first HPV vaccine produced by Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD), was approved by the U.S. Government. Since then Gardasil has been used in more than 100 countries and regions around the world. But on the Chinese mainland, the HPV vaccine rollout was delayed because of lengthy clinical trials. "Some of my colleagues started to pay attention to HPV vaccines some time ago. Many of them chose to go to Hong Kong for it because they didn't see any possibility that it would be available on the mainland soon," Liu said, "As far as I know, the optimum age for receiving the HPV vaccine is before 25. I'm 26, so I don't have time to wait. I need to safeguard my health as soon as possible." Dr. Wang Shaoming, with the Institute of Oncology of Peking Union Medical College, wrote in a paper published in the international academic journal Vaccine that if the HPV vaccine was given to females aged 9 to 15, the seven-year gap between 2006 and 2012 would mean 59 million Chinese females lost their best chance of access to the vaccine. Among them, 380,000 would likely get cervical cancer and 210,000 would die from the disease if no intervention measure like regular screening is taken. So why did it take so long for the Chinese mainland to approve the HPV vaccine? One important reason is that it has a different drug approval system. Under the Chinese law of drug registration, clinical trials designed for Chinese people are obligatory before a foreign pharmaceutical company can get approval for a new drug. According to China's management procedures for imported drugs, an imported vaccine should undergo domestic clinical trials before it can hit the market. But as it takes much longer for vaccines than other drugs to show effects, GSK's Cervarix, for example, spent six years in a clinical trial involving more than 6,000 subjects.   A doctor advises women having physical checkups at a hospital in Changchun, northeast China's Jilin Province, on March 8, 2014 (XINHUA) Mass demand According to a report released by CA, a cancer journal for clinicians, China showed a rising trend of cancer morbidity and mortality in 2015. Cervical cancer was among the top 10 diseases in terms of morbidity. According to the World Health Organization, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women in developing countries. There are around 130,000 new cases every year in China, more than 28 percent of the world's total. The disease also has the highest mortality rate worldwide. "Cervical cancer is currently the only malignant tumor with a definite etiology. It can be gradually eliminated by measures such as HPV vaccines, regular screening and early detection and treatment," said Lang Jinghe, Director of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, at a conference held in 2014. But the HPV vaccine does not mean 100 percent prevention, because the vaccines currently available in the market do not target all the carcinogenic virus subtypes, said Professor Zhou Qi from Chongqing Cancer Hospital. Regular screening is still necessary even after one receives the vaccine, he said. Remaining doubts "I did a lot of research online to learn about the vaccine's safety and necessity," said Liu. "Before the final decision was made, I hesitated a lot." Her initial trepidation was not unfounded, as the HPV vaccine can cause adverse reactions such as pain, swelling, redness, fever, dizziness, and nausea. Some also worry that a history of 10 years is too short to prove its safety. One well-known case of reaction occurred in 2013, when more than 30 Japanese women experienced body pain after receiving the GSK vaccine. As the pain didn't subside even after treatment, the Japanese Government suspended its recommendation of the two HPV vaccines, but did not ban the vaccines outright. "There is no evidence so far of a causal link between the vaccine and these serious adverse reactions," said Gong Xiaoming, Doctor at Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital. "It might have been accidental." Liu said she had been reading about the adverse reactions right before she left for Hong Kong the first time. "I was a little scared," she admitted. "But I eventually went, because I did not want to waste the money I had paid." As of March 2014, a total of 170 million doses of HPV vaccines had been administered globally. Besides the safety issue, the expensive price is another concern. Each dose of the HPV vaccine costs 850 yuan ($128) and a course consists of three shots. In many places, the vaccines are provided to young girls at the optimum age for free. "I got a discount thanks to a cooperation project between my company and the hospital, but the three shots still cost me $290. And I spent even more on flight tickets and hotels," said Liu. "That's the reason why some people gave it up, especially those above 25—limited efficacy and huge cost."

The South Korean conglomerate pulled the plug on the entire product line and slashed its third-quarter profit forecast by $2.3 billion. On a 10-point scale measuring financial and reputational damage to a company, Samsung’s recall ranks between 4 and 7, said Srinivas Reddy, director of the Center for Marketing Excellence at Singapore Management University who has researched product and brand failures. That’s because the exploding phones — while still “a calamity” for the company — haven’t killed anyone, Reddy said. “The threat for Samsung is how soon they can get back,” Reddy said. “If they don’t get back soon, it provides a vacuum for others to creep in.” In a marketplace where everything from cars to cows can have deadly defects, Samsung’s product failure is far from the worst in history. Merck & Co.’s 2004 scandal with its drug Vioxx — which studies showed could increase the chance of heart attacks and strokes in some patients — was a “catastrophic disaster,” rating a 10 on Reddy’s scale. Payouts from lawsuits and government investigations tallied more than $8.5 billion. Other notorious recalls include: Some versions of Ford Motor Co.’s Pinto compact car first introduced in 1971 came with a fatal design flaw — impacts to the rear of the vehicle could cause fuel leaks and explosions. Ford recalled about 1.5 million Pintos in 1978 amid a U.S. government investigation and criminal charges in the state of Indiana. Ford shut down Pinto production soon thereafter. The largest car-related recall in history is yet to be completed and could result in bankruptcy with billions of dollars in costs. Takata Corp.’s air-bags were meant to save lives in the event of a crash. Instead, the defective products became deadly cannons that shot shards of materials at passengers — at least 16 people have died in relation to the product. Food staples like chicken, beef and peanut butter have been recalled because of mistakes or unhygienic conditions in manufacturing processes. Peanut Corp. of America used the eponymous nut in more than 800 products that were tainted with salmonella in 2009. The result was nine deaths, more than 700 illnesses and one of the biggest recalls in U.S. history. The company collapsed and the former chief executive officer was sentenced to prison. Even medicines taken to ease the pain have proven to be fatal. In 1982, Johnson & Johnson recalled about 31 million bottles of Tylenol after seven people in the Chicago area died from swallowing cyanide-spiked capsules. Some of the highest-profile cases have involved children. Mattel Inc. recalled about 21 million Chinese-made toys, including those based on characters from “Sesame Street” and “Dora the Explorer,” after they were found to contain more than 180 times the allowable levels of lead paint. If ingested by children, lead can cause brain damage, learning problems and even death.

Disappointing Chinese trade data may weigh on the markets amid renewed concerns about the outlook for global economic growth. Traders also continue to digest the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting, which suggested that an interest rate hike at the December meeting remains on the table. U.S. stocks moved about in a directionless manner on Wednesday amid pre-announcements, the Fed minutes and a retreat in oil prices. The major averages initially moved lower but saw volatility throughout the morning. The Dow Industrials and the S&P 500 Index stayed mostly afloat thereafter before ending modestly higher, while the Nasdaq Composite continued to show volatility before closing in the red. The Dow Industrials added 15.54 points or 0.09 percent before ending at 18,144 and the S&P 500 Index tacked on 2.45 points or 0.11 percent to 2,139, while the Nasdaq Composite ended down 7.77 points or 0.15 percent at 5,239. Sixteen of the thirty Dow components finished the session higher, while the remaining fourteen stocks declined. McDonald's (MCD), Travelers (TRV) and Nike (NKE) were among the biggest gainers of the session, while Cisco (CSCO) fell sharply. Among the sectors, gold and utility stocks rallied, but biotechnology, networking, and oil service stocks came under selling pressure. On the economic front, the minutes of the September Fed meeting showed that the decision to leave interest rates unchanged was a close call. Several members seem to believe that a rate hike is needed relatively soon. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil is slipping $0.17 to $50.01 a barrel. The November futures ended the previous session down $0.61 at $50.18 a barrel. Gold futures are currently trading at $1,257.40 an ounce, up $3.60 from the previous session's close of $1,253.80 an ounce. On Wednesday, gold fell $2.10. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 103.64 yen compared to the 104.21 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Wednesday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1031 compared to yesterday's $1.1007. Asia Asian stocks sold off as the Fed minutes heightened rate hike fears and Chinese trade data reignited growth worries. The Hong Kong and Indian market led the slide. However, the New Zealand and Chinese markets rose marginally. With the overnight weakness of the yen abating, Japanese stocks ended moderately lower. The Nikkei 225 Index opened higher, as the yen had weakened to above the 104-level against the dollar overnight. After staying positive until early afternoon trading, the index retreated amid a let up in the strength of the dollar versus the yen and languished below the unchanged line thereafter. The index ended down 65.76 points or 0.39 percent at 16,774. Food, housing, retail, real estate, paper, export, banking and utility stocks came under selling pressure, while chemical and resource stocks saw mixed sentiment. Australia's All Ordinaries Index languished below the unchanged line throughout the session before ending down 36.90 points or 0.66 percent at a 2-week low of 5,518. Energy, IT, financial and material stocks were among the worst hit. On the other hand, consumer staple, industrial, real estate and utility stocks gained ground. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 375.75 points or 1.61 percent before ending at 23,031, while China's Shanghai Composite Index ended at 3,061, up 2.85 points or 0.09 percent. On the economic front, data released by the Chinese General Administration of Customs showed that exports from China fell 10 percent year-over-year in September compared to the 3.3 percent drop expected by economists. Imports fell 1.9 percent, belying expectations for a 0.9 percent increase. The trade surplus narrowed to $42 billion, smaller than the $53 billion surplus forecast by economists. Among other data, an index compiled by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry showed that tertiary or service sector activity in Japan fell in August after expanding in each of the previous two months. A Bank of Japan report showed that bank lending in Japan rose 2.2 percent in September, faster than the 2 percent increase in August. The Bank of Korea's monetary policy board voted to keep the nation's benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record low 1.25 percent for the fourth straight month. This followed June's surprise rate cut by 25 basis points from 1.50 percent after 10 straight meetings without a move. Europe European stocks opened lower and have seen further downside amid U.S. rate worries and Chinese growth concerns. Some lackluster domestic corporate tidings are also hurting performance. In major corporate news, Unilever (UL) reported third-quarter total turnover of 13.4 billion euros, down 0.1 percent due to a negative currency impact. Sales increased by 3.4% at constant exchange rates, while underlying sales growth was 3.2 percent. Meanwhile, U.K. supermarket chain Tesco announced that it has pulled dozens of household products supplied by Unilever from its online shopping site over pricing and a weaker pound. German drug maker Merck KgaA said it firmly expects to meet the objectives set for 2018. The company said it has focused on its pharmaceutical pipeline and continuously developed it further. France's Casino Group reported 2.9 percent sales growth on an organic basis for its third quarter. Same store sales were up 1.7 percent. Südzucker reported higher first half profits despite a drop in revenues. Fraport reported higher traffic for September, with the year-ago numbers dragged down by a strike. If not for the negative impact, traffic would have been flat. On the economic front, final data released by the German Federal Statistical Office confirmed the acceleration in annual German consumer price inflation to a 16-month high of 0.7 percent in September. This follows a 0.4 percent increase in August. The harmonized index of consumer prices rose 0.5 percent year-over-year, the fastest thus far in the year. House prices in the U.K. picked up steam in September, the latest survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors showed, with a house price balance score of +17. This was up from +13 in August and the three-year low of +5 in July. U.S. Economic Reports First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits held steady in the week ended October 8th, the Labor Department revealed in a report. The Labor Department said initial jobless claims came in at 246,000, unchanged from the previous week's revised level. Economists had expected jobless claims to climb to 254,000 from the 249,000 originally reported for the previous week. A separate report released by the Labor Department showed a modest increase in import prices in the month of September. The report said import prices inched up by 0.1 percent in September after falling by 0.2 percent in August. The uptick in prices matched economist estimates. The Labor Department also said export prices rose by 0.3 percent in September following a 0.8 percent drop in August. Export prices had been expected to edge up by 0.1 percent. The Energy Information Administration is set to release its weekly petroleum inventory report for the week ended October 7th at 11 am ET. In the week ended September 30th, crude oil stockpiles fell by 3 million barrels to 499.7 million barrels. Nevertheless, stockpiles were still at historically high levels for this time of year. Distillate inventories declined by 2.4 million barrels but were above the upper limit of the average range for this time of the year. However, gasoline inventories increased by 0.2 million barrels last week and were above the upper limit of the average range. Refinery capacity utilization averaged 90.8 percent over the four weeks ended September 30th compared to 92.2 percent for the four weeks ended September 23rd. Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Patrick Harker will speak on the economic outlook to the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia at 12:15 pm ET. The speech will be followed by an audience and media Q&A. The Treasury Department will release the results of its auction of 30-year bonds at 1 pm ET. The Treasury is also due to release its monthly budgetary statement for September at 2 pm ET. In August, the budgetary balance was at a deficit of $107.1 billion. At 9 pm ET, Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari is scheduled to participate in a town hall about ending too big to fail and the role of the Federal Reserve at the University of Montana in Missoula. Stocks in Focus Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported adjusted third quarter earnings of $1.70 per share, exceeding estimates by five cents a share. However, revenue came in below forecasts. Wells Fargo (WFC) announced its Chairman and CEO John Stumpf is retiring from the company and the board, effective immediately. The company announced the appointment of COO Tim Sloan to the post of CEO and its lead director Stephen Sanger as its non-executive Chairman. Railroad operator CSX (CSX) reported better than expected third quarter results despite both earnings and revenues declining year-over-year. Winnebago (WGO) reported fourth quarter net income of $13.1 million or $0.49 per share on revenues of $263.3 million. Analysts had expected the company to report earnings of $0.47 per share on revenues of $252.52 million. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America These Companies Are Sitting On Mountains Of Cash Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Walt Disney Q4 Profit Down - Update Forget Canada: The Best Places To Escape Trump's America Continental Stock Dips On Weak Q3 Profit; Sees Strong Earnings In Q4 AstraZeneca Q3 Pre-tax Profit Down On Crestor Generic; Backs FY View Alphabet Cancels Drone Deal With Starbucks As Project Leaders Pushed Out Viacom Q4 Adj.

Some lackluster domestic corporate tidings are also hurting performance. The major averages in the region are lower for the third straight session and are at their lowest level in over 2 weeks. The CAC 40 Index of France is currently down 1.30 percent at 4,395, the German DAX Index is losing 1.22 percent and is at 10,395 and the U.K.'s FTSE is at 6,975 by virtue of a 0.69 percent drop. The Swiss Market Index is down 0.79 percent at 8,005. The Euro STOXX 50 Index, a compilation of blue chip stocks across the euro area, is down 1.21 percent at 2,972. The weakness is broad based, with financial, automakers, resource and technology stocks being the worst hit. Wednesday, U.S. stocks moved about in a directionless manner amid pre-announcements, Fed minutes and retreat in oil prices before ending lower. Meanwhile, Asian stocks sold off today, as the FOMC minutes heightened rate hike fears and Chinese trade data reignited growth worries, with the Hong Kong and Indian market leading the slide.

Tesco is also down over 2 percent. German drug maker Merck KgaA is up marginally after it said it firmly believes to meet the objectives set for 2018. The company said it has focused pharmaceutical pipeline and continuously developed it further. France's Casino Group reported 2.9 percent sales quarter on an organic basis for its third quarter. Same store sales were up 1.7 percent. The stock is down over 1.75 percent. Südzucker is rallying over 1.75 percent after it reported higher first half profits despite revenue decline. Fraport reported higher traffic for September, with the year-ago numbers dragged down by a strike. If not for the negative impact, traffic would have been flat. On the economic front, final data released by the German Federal Statistical Office confirmed the acceleration in annual German consumer price inflation to a 16-month high of 0.7 percent in September. This follows a 0.4 percent increase in August. The harmonized index of consumer prices rose 0.5 percent year-over-year, the fastest thus far in the year. House prices in the U.K. picked up steam in September, the latest survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors showed, with a house price balance score of +17. This was up from +13 in August and the three-year low of +5 in July. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America These Companies Are Sitting On Mountains Of Cash More Top Stories AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet Stocks Close Mixed On The Day But Sharply Higher For The Week - U.S. Commentary VP-Elect Pence To Take Over As Head Of Trump Transition Team Airlines Struggle With Computer Glitch Trump To Drop Out Of Trans-Pacific Partnership Within First 100 Days Gohmert Says Congress Can Help Fund Border Wall Singles Day: Alibaba Sales Skyrocket Pence Holds "Warm And Professional" Meeting With Biden Stocks Seeing Modest Weakness Following Post-Election Rally - U.S. Commentary Stocks Turning In Lackluster Performance In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy GrubHub CEO: I Did Not Tell Trump Supporters To Quit U.S. Consumer Sentiment Rebounds To Six-Month High In November Trump Victory Inspires Mixed Feelings Of Fear And Relief Trump Promises Decisions On Top Administration Officials "Soon" <<Previous        137 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Walt Disney Q4 Profit Down - Update Forget Canada: The Best Places To Escape Trump's America Continental Stock Dips On Weak Q3 Profit; Sees Strong Earnings In Q4 AstraZeneca Q3 Pre-tax Profit Down On Crestor Generic; Backs FY View Alphabet Cancels Drone Deal With Starbucks As Project Leaders Pushed Out Viacom Q4 Adj.

These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. Note that an uncontrolled trial of the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab for cisplatin-ineligible metastatic urothelial cancer found a 24% objective response rate that increased with PD-1 expression. A different trial, evaluating the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer who had received prior treatment also showed promising results. COPENHAGEN -- Two more anti-PD-1 drugs demonstrated activity in metastatic urothelial cancer, staking a claim to indication territory already occupied by a third drug in the class. One-fourth of patients with cisplatin-ineligible disease responded to first-line treatment with pembrolizumab (Keytruda), and a cut point for PD-L1 expression of ≥10% appeared to identify patients most likely to respond to the immune checkpoint inhibitor. Treatment with nivolumab (Opdivo) led to a 20% response rate in patients with previously treated metastatic urothelial cancer. Earlier this year, atezolizumab (Tecentriq) received FDA approval for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer that progressed on prior therapy. Nivolumab received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA as a potential second-line therapy for metastatic urothelial cancer, and pembrolizumab investigation as first-line therapy for advanced urothelial cancer will continue in a randomized, phase III trial, as reported here at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO). "Pembrolizumab has substantial activity with a favorable safety profile as first-line therapy in cisplatin-ineligible patients with metastatic bladder cancer," said Arjun Balar, MD, of NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. "The biomarker cut point will need to be validated in the larger study population, but seems to identify patients most likely to respond to pembrolizumab well." "Immunotherapy is rapidly redefining our treatment approach for patients facing this dreadful disease," he added. ESMO clinical expert Maria De Santis, MD, of the University of Warwick in England, noted that the response rate with pembrolizumab appeared slightly lower than what has been observed with chemotherapy in first line, but the duration of response to the PD-1 inhibitor appeared longer. Speaking to results of both studies, De Santis agreed with Balar that "immune checkpoint inhibitors have started to alter the therapeutic landscape for bladder cancer. We expect even more dramatic changes in the coming years with the use of immunotherapy in other clinical stages and as combination therapy." Cisplatin-based chemotherapy remains standard of care as first-line treatment for advanced urothelial cancer. However, a substantial proportion of patients have impaired renal function, poor performance status, or other medical conditions that make them ineligible for cisplatin. Until the recent emergence of immunotherapy, alternatives to cisplatin remained limited. Pembrolizumab Data Balar reported findings from a phase II, open-label evaluation of pembrolizumab as first-line therapy for patients with cisplatin-ineligible advanced urothelial cancer. The presentation included data from a planned interim analysis of the first 100 patients enrolled in the ongoing trial, which has an accrual target of 352 patients. The primary objectives of the trial are to evaluate the objective response rate and determine the cut point for high PD-L1 expression. Secondary objectives include duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, and objective response rate by different levels of PD-L1 expression. The 100 patients had a median age of 75, and the primary reasons for cisplatin ineligibility were poor performance status and renal dysfunction (43% and 45%, respectively). Balar reported that 24 of the 100 patients attained objective responses with pembrolizumab, including six patients who had complete responses. An additional 15 patients had stable disease. More than half of the patients had some regression of target lesions. After a median follow-up of 8 months, the median duration of response had yet to be reached but ranged from 1.4 to 9.8 months. Among responding patients, duration of response was 6 months or longer in 83%. An analysis of PD-L1 expression in tumor cells and infiltrating immune cells established a tentative cutoff of ≥10% as expression level beyond which the response rate did not appear to improve. At that cutoff, 11 of 30 (37%) patients attained objective responses, as compared with six of 33 (18%) patients with PD-L1 expression <1% and five of 33 (15%) patients with expression levels of 1% to <10%. The most common adverse events (all grades) were fatigue (14%) and pruritus (12%). The most frequently reported immune-mediate adverse event was hypothyroidism (6%, all grade 2). Nivolumab Results The nivolumab study involved 270 patients with advanced urothelial cancer that had progressed during or after platinum-based chemotherapy. The trial had a primary endpoint of objective response rate, and secondary/exploratory endpoints included PFS, overall survival, safety, quality of life, and biomarkers associated with efficacy, said Matthew Galsky, MD, of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. Median patient age was 66. About 30% of patients had received two or more prior regimens for advanced urothelial cancer, and a similar proportion received nivolumab as initial treatment. Galsky reported that 46% of patients had tumors with ≥1% PD-L1 expression and 31% had ≥5% ligand expression. Overall, 19.6% of the patients achieved objective responses, including complete responses in 2.3%. An additional 23% of patients had stable disease. The response rate increased from PD-L1 expression from 16.1% for patients with PD-L1 expression <1% to 28.4% for those with PD-L1 expression ≥5%. Of the 52 responding patients followed for at least 6 months, duration of response had yet to be reached (7.4 months to not reached), and 40 of 52 patients had ongoing responses. The median PFS for all patients was 2.0 months, including 1.87 months in association with PD-L1 expression <1% and 3.55 months for PD-L1 expression ≥1%. The entire study population had a median overall survival of 8.74 months, including 5.95 months for PD-L1 expression <1% and 11.30 months for PD-L1 expression ≥1%. The most common adverse events (all grades) were fatigue (16.7%), pruritus (9.3%), diarrhea (8.9%), decreased appetite (8.1%), hypothyroidism (7.8%), and nausea (7.0%). The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were fatigue and diarrhea (1.9% each). The pembrolizumab study was supported by Merck and the nivolumab study by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Balar disclosed relationships with Merck, Genentech/Roche, and AstraZeneca/Medimmune. Galsky disclosed relationships with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Genentech, Merck, Novartis, Astellas, Dendreon, Janssen, and Dual Therapeutics. Reviewed by F.

Minter | AP This Oct. 9, 2016 photo shows a damaged Samsung Galaxy Note 7 on a table in Richmond, Va., after it caught fire earlier in the day. Between Samsung phones, Chipotle burritos and Volkswagen diesel engines, it seems like it's been the year of recalls. It begs the question: How big is the Samsung recall, compared with all the others? The Korean electronics giant announced Tuesday that it will halt production of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone just weeks after U.S. regulators issued a recall of 1 million of the model for risk of catching fire. According to reports, the replacement models were also defective. Samsung's market capitalization shed about $18 billion following the news. The fiasco will probably cost the company billions, but it's hard to compare against other major product recalls. Any kind of item can be recalled, and there's no single source for information on those recalls. Instead, there's a patchwork of at least seven government agencies, each of which is tasked with tracking recalls of a particular type of product. That alphabet soup of government agencies — including the NHTSA, CPSC, FDA and EPA — are all linked at www.Recalls.gov, a supposedly one-stop shop for recall information that really just points the user back to each individual agency's website. Each agency has its own units for tracking recalls: pounds of meat, units of defective vending machine jewelry, or bags of glass-contaminated bread. Here's a look at how each organization tracks its recalls, and the biggest ones on record. 143 million pounds of beef The USDA keeps what is probably the most useful and organized recall data out of all the big regulators, including the danger level, reason for the recall, and number of pounds affected. The majority of recalls are for food-borne bacteria like e. coli and listeria. The biggest USDA recall on record was the February 2008 recall of 143.4 million pounds of fresh and frozen beef products from Westland/Hallmark Meat, a California processor that had slaughtered unhealthy cattle that couldn't walk — a clear violation of meat-handling standards, because that's a possible symptom of mad cow disease and other illnesses. Before the recall was announced, about 50 million pounds of the meat were distributed in school lunches and other federal programs (the company even won school "supplier of the year"). Even though the risk was considered small and some of the beef had already been consumed, two years worth of meat production was recalled, and the cost forced the company into bankruptcy. Eight people sickened in listeria outbreak The Obama administration once proposed creating a single agency tasked with food safety overall, but regulation is still split between the USDA's responsibilities and most other foods, which are handled by the FDA along with drugs and medical products. An FDA spokesperson said the agency didn't have data organized in a way that would allow them to identify the largest recalls on record. Indeed, though the agency publishes the quantity recalled, there isn't much consistency in how information is recorded. A recall might involve "3,560 sandwiches," "10 pallets," "4 boxes," or "dozens," "units," "bags," "cases," "pieces of oysters," "pounds" or "jars" of recalled foods. In our research, it appears that the single largest food recall for the FDA took place only a few months ago. Starting in 2013, nine people were sickened by listeria that appeared to come from fruits and vegetables produced by CRF Frozen Foods. The products had been shipped throughout the U.S., Canada and Mexico as part of more than 40 brands at major retailers. The recall in early 2016 affected over 150 million pounds of products, according to FDA records, and millions more in products that were made with the fruits and vegetables. The FDA's drug recall data is also hard to work with. Likely one of the most costly drug recalls in recent history was Merck's 2004 recall of Vioxx, an arthritis medicine worth billions of dollars in revenue each year. At the time of the recall, Vioxx was being used by millions of people, and potentially thousands of deaths were linked to the drug. The company lost potential revenue in the tens of billions and paid at least $6 billion in settlements. Getty Images Used cars of German carmaker Volkswagen stand on display at a Volkswagen car dealership on September 22, 2015 in Berlin, Germany. Volkswagen's $15 billion settlement The EPA has jurisdiction over recalls involving pesticides, rodenticides, fungicides and vehicle emission testing. The agency doesn't seem to keep data on those recalls on its website and did not provide figures by press time. Nonetheless, it is likely that the biggest recall in the agency's history will be for Volkswagen, after that company was found to have cheated on emissions tests. In a nearly $15 billion dollar settlement this year, Volkswagen agreed to give owners the option to sell back the car or have their vehicles modified, and must have an overall recall rate of at least 85 percent or pay additional fees. The company will also be required to fund projects to improve infrastructure and reduce emissions. Faulty airbags The biggest vehicle recall ever ordered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was for 32 million Fix-a-Flat tire inflators sold by Pennzoil-Quaker State, according to figures shared by an NHTSA spokesperson. The tires repaired with the kits were found to explode when exposed to extreme heat. That's a large single recall, but reports indicate that it only cost the company about $25 million. If we take into account scope and cost, it's more fair to say that the actual largest vehicle recall in history is actually a combination of several recalls for Takata airbags beginning in 2014. The airbags could injure or kill occupants with their forceful deployment. Takata airbags were included in more than 200 million vehicles from 14 different automakers and at least 10 deaths have been linked to the malfunction. About 50 million airbags have been recalled so far, but the total cost of the recall could cost Takata as much as $24 billion. Getty Images A deployed airbag is seen in a 2001 Honda Accord at the LKQ Pick Your Part salvage yard on May 22, 2015 in Medley, Florida. The largest automotive recall in history centers around the defective Takata Corp. air bags that are found in millions of vehicles that are manufactured by BMW, Chrysler, Daimler Trucks, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru and Toyota. ( 150 million pieces of lead-tainted jewelry Consumer products is one category of recalls most people are familiar with. We generally hear about them described in terms of the number of units recalled. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is the government agency tasked with regulating the safety of thousands of types of consumer products in the nation. It also handles recalls for those products: Everything from craft paint to office furniture. According to figure provided by a CPSC spokesperson, the biggest recall was vending machine jewelry made by the Genuine Toy & Joy company in 2004. The jewelry was found to have an unsafe amount of lead and 150 million pieces were recalled. But no one was actually hurt by the lead-tainted jewelry. Compare that to the recall with the next highest number of units, that of some 50 million Roman and Roll-Up Shades in 2010. At least one death by strangulation was linked to the shades, and at least 23 other injuries were reported.

The company expects to enrol 2,000 patients in the first six months. Satish Kumar / The National Aster DM launches digital monitoring for patients in UAE Sananda Sahoo October 12, 2016 Updated: October 12, 2016 07:56 PM Related Aster DM buys into Abu Dhabi’s day care clinical services Healthcare leads UAE jobs market but overall employment listings online down 22% Aster DM’s healthy growth with online pharmacy launch Aster DM opens first Medcare clinic in Sharjah Aster DM has launched a cloud-based technology that allows patients to manage diabetes and hypertension from home as lifestyle diseases prove beneficial to healthcare companies. After a four-month pilot study involving 100 patients, the Dubai healthcare company launched two mobile applications that patients can use to input their sugar and blood pressure readings from home. The information goes to Aster DM’s health data management centre and in case of any fluctuations in the readings, the patient gets a call from the physician. Patients can sign up for the programme for Dh999 a year, which includes blood glucose and blood pressure monitoring devices. The apps, iFora Diabetes Manager and iFora BP, are free to download and available on Android and iOS. The home-monitoring programme is not covered through insurance, said Alisha Moopen, the executive director and chief executive for hospitals and clinics in the Arabian Gulf region at Aster DM. The company expects to enrol about 2,000 patients in the programme within six months. "You see these lifestyle diseases across the board, among locals as well as expats and in more and more younger people," Ms Moopen said. Diabetes and hypertension can be inherited, but are also side-effects of a sedentary lifestyle and a high-calorie diet. Of the UAE’s 7.4 million population, about 1 million people in the 20 to 79-year-old group had diabetes last year, according to the Brussels-based advocacy group International Diabetes Federation. While countrywide data for hypertension is not available, in Dubai alone 3.5 per cent of the population suffers from hypertension, according to the Dubai Healthcare Authority (DHA). The high prevalence of diabetes in the UAE poses a burgeoning disease management segment for healthcare companies. This week, Ras Al Khaimah-based pharmaceutical manufacturer Julphar launched two new medications in the UAE for the management of type 2 diabetes. Julphar will supply these medications as part of its deal with the US pharma company Merck Sharp & Dohme. Its plant in Ras Al Khaimah has the capacity to manufacture 40 million vials of insulin a year. In December, it launched a real-time continuous glucose level monitoring device in the UAE. Aster DM is also working on electronic dispensing of medications and online consultation with its physicians that would enable patients access care from home. Both the digital platforms are currently awaiting licensing approval from DHA. The Dubai company expects to float an initial public offering on the Bombay Stock Exchange in the next six to 12 months, Ms Moopen said. ssahoo@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Aster DM buys into Abu Dhabi’s day care clinical services Healthcare leads UAE jobs market but overall employment listings online down 22% Aster DM’s healthy growth with online pharmacy launch Aster DM opens first Medcare clinic in Sharjah More Technology Saudi Arabia and Alabbar eye online retail domination Stand-alone VR headsets can outperform add-ons like Rift Alibaba smashes Singles’ Day record as Chinese consumers open wallets Trump fills the empty space that tech created MOST VIEWED Business | All Abu Dhabi’s Royal Jet offers VIP alternative to travelling first class Renault faces criminal inquiry over emissions cheating suspicions A380s and Boeing 777s make up Emirates’ entire fleet as it scores a world’s first Etihad Airways on the lookout for new pilots in Europe Saudi Arabia and Alabbar eye online retail domination Dubai Parks operator aims to lift revenue as costs rise India’s currency move will hit property and gold Head of GE Oil & Gas says oil industry cuts not done yet Basking in the glow of Egypt’s devaluation Trump looms large over World Economic Forum event in Dubai More Most Viewed American-Iranian political tensions will only escalate UAE detection stations fully operational after meteor hits Abu Dhabi Louvre Abu Dhabi announces first contemporary art installations 2018 Africa World Cup qualifying: Chelsea pair Victor Moses and John Obi Mikel on target for Nigeria Watch out for the supermoon on Monday Girl, 16, trafficked to Dubai and forced into prostitution, court hears Muhammad Surur and the normalisation of extremism Hate crime and Islamophobia increases after Trump victory Having trouble saving money in the UAE?

The company expects to enrol 2,000 patients in the first six months. Satish Kumar / The National Aster DM launches digital monitoring for patients in UAE Sananda Sahoo October 12, 2016 Updated: October 12, 2016 07:56 PM Related Aster DM buys into Abu Dhabi’s day care clinical services Healthcare leads UAE jobs market but overall employment listings online down 22% Aster DM’s healthy growth with online pharmacy launch Aster DM opens first Medcare clinic in Sharjah Aster DM has launched a cloud-based technology that allows patients to manage diabetes and hypertension from home as lifestyle diseases prove beneficial to healthcare companies. After a four-month pilot study involving 100 patients, the Dubai healthcare company launched two mobile applications that patients can use to input their sugar and blood pressure readings from home. The information goes to Aster DM’s health data management centre and in case of any fluctuations in the readings, the patient gets a call from the physician. Patients can sign up for the programme for Dh999 a year, which includes blood glucose and blood pressure monitoring devices. The apps, iFora Diabetes Manager and iFora BP, are free to download and available on Android and iOS. The home-monitoring programme is not covered through insurance, said Alisha Moopen, the executive director and chief executive for hospitals and clinics in the Arabian Gulf region at Aster DM. The company expects to enrol about 2,000 patients in the programme within six months. "You see these lifestyle diseases across the board, among locals as well as expats and in more and more younger people," Ms Moopen said. Diabetes and hypertension can be inherited, but are also side-effects of a sedentary lifestyle and a high-calorie diet. Of the UAE’s 7.4 million population, about 1 million people in the 20 to 79-year-old group had diabetes last year, according to the Brussels-based advocacy group International Diabetes Federation. While countrywide data for hypertension is not available, in Dubai alone 3.5 per cent of the population suffers from hypertension, according to the Dubai Healthcare Authority (DHA). The high prevalence of diabetes in the UAE poses a burgeoning disease management segment for healthcare companies. This week, Ras Al Khaimah-based pharmaceutical manufacturer Julphar launched two new medications in the UAE for the management of type 2 diabetes. Julphar will supply these medications as part of its deal with the US pharma company Merck Sharp & Dohme. Its plant in Ras Al Khaimah has the capacity to manufacture 40 million vials of insulin a year. In December, it launched a real-time continuous glucose level monitoring device in the UAE. Aster DM is also working on electronic dispensing of medications and online consultation with its physicians that would enable patients access care from home. Both the digital platforms are currently awaiting licensing approval from DHA. The Dubai company expects to float an initial public offering on the Bombay Stock Exchange in the next six to 12 months, Ms Moopen said. ssahoo@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Aster DM buys into Abu Dhabi’s day care clinical services Healthcare leads UAE jobs market but overall employment listings online down 22% Aster DM’s healthy growth with online pharmacy launch Aster DM opens first Medcare clinic in Sharjah More Technology Saudi Arabia and Alabbar eye online retail domination Stand-alone VR headsets can outperform add-ons like Rift Alibaba smashes Singles’ Day record as Chinese consumers open wallets Trump fills the empty space that tech created MOST VIEWED Business | All Abu Dhabi’s Royal Jet offers VIP alternative to travelling first class Renault faces criminal inquiry over emissions cheating suspicions A380s and Boeing 777s make up Emirates’ entire fleet as it scores a world’s first Etihad Airways on the lookout for new pilots in Europe Saudi Arabia and Alabbar eye online retail domination Dubai Parks operator aims to lift revenue as costs rise India’s currency move will hit property and gold Head of GE Oil & Gas says oil industry cuts not done yet Basking in the glow of Egypt’s devaluation Trump looms large over World Economic Forum event in Dubai More Most Viewed American-Iranian political tensions will only escalate UAE detection stations fully operational after meteor hits Abu Dhabi Louvre Abu Dhabi announces first contemporary art installations 2018 Africa World Cup qualifying: Chelsea pair Victor Moses and John Obi Mikel on target for Nigeria Watch out for the supermoon on Monday Girl, 16, trafficked to Dubai and forced into prostitution, court hears Muhammad Surur and the normalisation of extremism Hate crime and Islamophobia increases after Trump victory Having trouble saving money in the UAE?

dominate in psoriasis? The emergence of biosimilar anti-TNFs could expand access to established biological therapies for psoriasis. However, recently launched therapies and pipeline agents can deliver better outcomes, for longer. Which options are most likely to gain ground in this increasingly crowded treatment landscape? We interviewed 12 US and EU payers with expertise in formulary development and drug reimbursement to get their perspective on the challenges facing the MS market. Plus you'll find out how payers view pipeline MS treatments, what advice they have for Pharma, and which clinical trials to watch. Covering 9 currently marketed drugs, and 10 currently in clinical trials, the report reveals candid insights about the psoriasis landscape from 12 key opinion leaders (KOLs) in North America and Europe. You'll learn which treatments satisfy dermatologists' objectives for psoriasis treatment, whether oral therapies are overtaking injectables, and which pipeline drugs—both biosimilar and innovative molecules—are likely to succeed. Top takeaways Despite numerous treatments, unmet needs persist: KOLs are particularly eager to see longer-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Find out what else they are looking for in future therapies. Limited uptake of current oral therapies: KOLs are enthusiastic about oral treatments, but they want more than oral delivery. What will pipeline oral agents have to offer to overtake injectables? Biosimilars are gaining acceptance: Favourable reimbursement decisions could intensify competition in the psoriasis market. Find out about the additional factors that will affect their uptake in real-world clinical practice. IL-targeting therapies are not created equal: The current gold standard, Stelara (ustekinumab), targets IL-12/23 but emerging competitors focus on IL-17 and IL-23 alone. How do KOLs perceive these next-generation mAbs? New pathways elicit mixed feedback: Early-stage candidates exploit pathways previously untargeted in psoriasis. Discover which ones excite KOLs, and which ones don't. Safety is a key concern: Concerns about side effects and long-term safety hang over several newer treatments for psoriasis. Find out what they are and how KOLs expect them to influence use. Personalised care is on the horizon: KOLs believe outcomes from current therapies can be improved, and express optimism about the possibility of personalising treatment. How could this trend shape the future marketplace?
