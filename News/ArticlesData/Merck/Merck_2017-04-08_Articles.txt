Wells Tags: abortion cells in vaccines, circovirus, MMR, polio vaccine toxins, rotarix dangers, sv40, toxic vaccines, vaccine excipients, vaccine toxins (Natural News) Want to inject a serum into your body that contains a deadly virus that’s killing pigs in China? Would you like to get “immunized” with cultures contaminated with viral agents from infected African green monkey kidneys? Don’t worry, it’s all said to be perfectly “safe and effective,” even though no clinical trials have ever been done to prove it. Research shows that a double infection of SV40 and measles virus occurred in single cells of African green monkey kidney cultures. In case you don’t know, SV40 is an abbreviation for Simian vacuolating virus 40, a polyomavirus found in both monkeys and humans that can cause cancer. This virus was named Simian Virus 40 or SV40 because it was the 40th simian virus found in monkey kidney cells. Mysterious spike in number of dead pigs in China linked to same viral agents used in Rotavirus Vaccines The FDA is at it again – burying evidence of massive fraud and dangerous excipients used in US “FDA-approved” vaccines. Have no doubts, the FDA is just as corrupt as the CDC. A few years ago, more than 13,000 pigs died within a matter of weeks along the Huangpu River that flows through Shanghai, China. One prime suspected cause of death was the porcine circovirus (PCV). Samples taken from the dead pigs tested positive for the deadly infection, which is a common ingredient in the Rotarix and RotaTeq Rotavirus vaccines injected into tens of millions US children. Sounds crazy, right? The inventor who got rich off the Rotarix vaccine is the infamous Dr. Paul Offit, who auspiciously promotes his own toxic jabs using CDC propaganda. Though there are zero clinical tests proving that circovirus type 1 and 2 (PCV1 and PCV2) are safe when injected into humans, but the FDA and the pro-vax schemer Paul Offit claim it’s safe to inject this deadly porcine virus into muscle tissue of children, babies and of course pregnant women. Is there any wonder why the side effects and serious adverse events that occur after injecting deadly pig viruses include compromised immune systems, intussusception (tangled intestines), shedding and transmission (spreading the virus to other humans), bronchiolitis, gastroenteritis, pneumonia and urinary tract infection. It tells you right on the RotaTeq vaccine insert sheet that infection can cause fever, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of body fluids, hospitalization and even death in some children. Well, no wonder! Look what’s in the vaccine. Let’s dig deeper into this vaccine ingredient linked to pig carcasses turning up by the thousands in Shanghai, China Porcine circovirus types 1 and 2 have been in the news several times as a serious threat to public health. In May of 2010, the FDA temporarily suspended the use of GlaxoSmithKline’s (GSK) rotavirus vaccine “Rotarix” because DNA from circovirus PCV1 was found in the vaccine; however, Merck’s RotaTeq jab, which contains DNA fragments from circovirus PCV2, was not suspended. Go figure. Meanwhile, the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) called for the complete elimination of pig virus DNA in vaccines. NVIC asked GSK to eliminate PCV1 DNA from Rotarix, and told Merck to recall all vaccines containing PCV2 DNA fragments, because PCV2 is “an aggressive virus that causes immune suppression, wasting disease and death in baby pigs.” Evidence that it is safe (and not deadly) for children to swallow pig virus in live oral rotavirus vaccines is still missing! Polio vaccine once contaminated with SV40 now contains infected African green monkey kidney cells Flashback: By 1960, the Salk polio vaccine had been injected into nearly 100 million American children and adults. It’s estimated that up to 30 percent of those vaccines were contaminated because they contained the live virus SV40. Federal testing of the vaccines followed but was performed inadequately (on purpose) for just 14 days – obviously not long enough to detect the deadly virus that lay dormant in tens of millions of children. In the years that followed, the incidence of pediatric cancer skyrocketed. Do the math. Pediatric cancer continued to climb throughout the 1960’s, 70’s, 80’s and 90’s. Cancer is now the number one killer of children in the U.S. Is it dangerous, unethical and inhumane that certain US vaccines contain human cell lines that come from aborted fetuses? Yes. Several US vaccines, according to the CDC’s vaccine excipient list, contain human diploid cells from aborted fetuses. Are you against abortions? Are you a vegan? Do you think aborted parts are sold on the black market (via Planned Parenthood) to vaccine manufacturers for this reason? Several immunizations that contain cells harvested from infected human diploid cells from abortions are now recommended for babies and children; they include Poliovax, Adenovirus, Hepatitis A, MMR II (measles, mumps, rubella combo jab), MMRV (V=chicken pox), Rotavirus and Smallpox. To date, there are two human diploid cell lines prepared from tissues of aborted fetuses: WI-38, which are human diploid lung fibroblasts from a female fetus from 1964, and MRC-5, which are human lung fibroblasts from a male fetus aborted for psychiatric reasons in 1966. Ask your doctor and nurse why the CDC and FDA approve vaccines that contain deadly animal viruses. Make sure your doctor and nurse read every single ingredient on the vaccine insert to you aloud before you consider any vaccines for yourself or your children ever again, including the flu shot (influenza vaccine that still contains mercury). Question any and every single ingredient that sounds experimental. Ask what purpose those “excipients” have for vaccine safety and efficacy. Investigate chemical medical violence for yourself right here and listen to all the testimonials.

database. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market.   (EMAILWIRE.COM, April 08, 2017 ) Antibacterial drugs are chemical compounds used to treat infections caused by bacteria either by killing or inhibiting the growth of bacteria. The term antibiotic is often used synonymously with an antibacterial. However, antibiotics are agents that work against microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and parasites but are not effective against viruses. The term antibiotic was originally coined to refer to any compound of microbial origin, which is antagonistic to the growth of the microbe. Antibacterial acts via various mechanisms such as the inhibition of cell wall synthesis, the inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis, the disruption of the cell membrane, and the inhibition of protein synthesis. They can be bacteriostatic or bactericidal in nature, i.e., they either block vital processes in bacteria, kill the bacteria, or halt them from growing. Antibiotics that affect a wide range of bacteria are called broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin and gentamicin). Antibiotics that affect only a few types of bacteria are called narrow spectrum antibiotics (e.g., penicillin). For more information http://www.reportsweb.com/global-antibacterial-drugs-market-2015-2019 Publisher's analysts forecast the global antibacterial drugs market to grow at a CAGR of 1.06% over the period 2014-2019.

In the context of the number of patients screened initially, however, relatively few benefited. Molecular screening of different tumor types led to a matched targeted treatment strategy for a subset of patients with advanced, hard-to-treat cancers, although only a minority of those who were successfully screened and treated derived clinical benefit from the approach, a single-center, single-arm, open-label trial indicated. Out of a cohort of 1,035 patients, a molecular portrait could be identified in 89% of them, among whom an actionable target was detected in almost half of the group at 49%, reported Fabrice Andre, MD, PhD, of Gustave Roussy Cancer Institute in Villejuif, France, and colleagues. This subsequently led to 199 patients actually receiving a treatment course matched to their specific genomic alternation. And in this subgroup of patients, clinical benefit as reflected by the percentage of patients who achieved a progression-free survival (PFS) interval on matched therapy (PFS2) that was 1.3-fold longer than the PFS interval achieved on prior therapy (PFS1) was documented in one-third of them, 11% of them being objective responses. "There are controversies about whether the use of high-throughput genomics could improve outcomes in patients with hard-to-treat cancers," explained Andre and colleagues in Cancer Discovery. "In the present study, we have shown that tumor sequencing improves outcome in 33% of patients with advanced cancers," they added. "Although these results are encouraging, only 7% of the successfully screened patients benefited from this approach." The Molecular Screening for Cancer Treatment Optimization (MOSCATO) 01 trial involved both adult and pediatric patients with a variety of tumor types. The most common tumors included digestive cancer followed by lung cancer, urological cancers, breast cancer, and head and neck cancer. The median number of prior lines of therapy was 4 and tumor biopsies were successfully taken in the majority of patients. The approaches used to obtain molecular portraits for the 843 patients in whom such a portrait was identified included targeted sequencing and array comparative genomic hybridization analysis. As investigators noted, both RNA sequencing and whole-exome sequencing were added during the course of the study. "The vast majority of the patients received matched therapy in the context of phase I/II trials," Andre noted. Complete responses were documented in two patients or 1% of those who received matched treatment. There were also 20 partial responses, 10% of the treated cohort. Disease stabilized in 52% of the group and 17% had progressive disease. "The median follow-up for progression-free survival on matched therapy or PFS2 was 20 months," researchers noted, "and median PFS2 was estimated at 2.3 months." The estimated median overall survival was 11.9 months. "There are several ways to further improve the efficacy of precision medicine," Andre suggested. First, researchers need better ways with which to identify genomic alterations. For example, although both RNA and whole-exome sequencing were done in a large proportion of patients in the MOSCATO trial, "they were not useful to drive patients to therapy," as he pointed out. Researchers also need to be able to more accurately identify which patients might gain from a genomics approach. Lastly, scientists need to identify targeted combinations of therapies that might improve clinical outcomes, especially for patients who have more than one driver alteration. Commenting on the study, Leif Ellisen, MD, PhD, of Massachusetts General Hospital Breast Cancer Center in Boston, felt that overall, the MOSCATO 01 trial was an encouraging study. "There are a few things that you have to remember about this study in particular and the field in general," Ellisen said. To some degree the "deck was stacked" against the study because patients who previously received standard therapy -- including targeted agents against well-established actionable targets -- were excluded from this trial. "In other words, the study had already culled out known successes of genotype-driven therapy," Ellisen emphasized. He also pointed out that the median number of prior therapies was four, so investigators were pitted against advanced disease known to be more aggressive and resistant to treatment. "But the bigger picture is that systematically doing genotypic-directed therapy is really a means to a larger end and that larger end is allowing us to collect the data about the relationship between the genotype of a tumor and response to therapy that informs us how we should treat future patients." If physicians 30 years ago abandoned chemotherapy for patients with advanced cancer on the grounds that only a minority of them responded to it, "we would never have made any progress in oncology," he added. "This is really the same story -- because only a minority of patients who benefit from this approach today does not mean that the data we are collecting and correlating with responses is not going to be the thing that allows us to make advances tomorrow as we refine our predictions and more patients can benefit in the future."

These structures help point the way to designing medicines of the future. Credit: Greg Stewart/SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Although the two angiotensin II receptors are thought to be very similar, an X-ray study showed clear differences in the pockets where the receptors bind to drug-like compounds. This illustration shows details in the pocket structures of AT2 (left) and AT1 (right). Credit: Greg Stewart/SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory A depiction of the AT2 receptor (gray spirals and filaments) extending through a cell membrane; the blue ovals represent the membrane’s inner and outer surfaces. A potential drug compound is bound into the receptor’s exterior pocket (yellow) stabilizing the receptor in an active-like conformation. This would normally lead to activation of G-proteins and spreading a signal throughout the cell. But in the case of AT2, the place where G-proteins dock to receive the signal is blocked by a spiral-shaped helix (orange) that is part of the receptor. This new detail helps explain why AT2 receptors do not bind and activate G-proteins, but instead likely transmit the signal inside the cell via other yet unknown mechanisms. X-ray studies done in part at the Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory have produced surprising insights into the workings of a hormone receptor associated with blood pressure regulation. Researchers believe it could be a target for new medicines related to cardiovascular conditions, neuropathic pain and tissue growth. Using powerful X-rays from SLAC's Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) and Argonne National Laboratory's Advanced Photon Source (APS), scientists discovered new structural details of an angiotensin II receptor called AT2 that has puzzled researchers for two decades. It is one of two angiotensin II receptors, and its partner, AT1, has been successfully used as a target for high blood pressure medications. The information they uncovered could give drug developers a new path for compounds that combat pain and inflammation or promote tissue regeneration by docking snugly into a pocket in AT2. "Unlike its sibling AT1, the AT2 receptor has not been fully understood," said Vadim Cherezov, chemistry professor at the University of Southern California and principal investigator of the study published today in Nature. "Through this study we uncovered many important details about the AT2 receptor structure and how it binds to chemical compounds, information that will stimulate further studies of the receptor’s function and could enable an exciting next step in drug discovery." Two Receptors, Many Mysteries Both angiotensin II receptors, AT1 and AT2, are key components of a hormone system that helps regulate blood pressure and sodium levels in the blood. They are known as “membrane proteins” because they straddle the plasma membranes of cells, where they receive signals from hormones outside the cell and pass them along to soluble partners inside the cell, such as G proteins or β-arrestins, setting off a cascade of events that spread the signal cell-wide. Many hypertension medications currently on the market target the AT1 receptor because of its well-understood role in blood pressure regulation; they block AT1 to bring blood pressure down. Cherezov led earlier experiments at LCLS that provided structural details of receptor blockers bound to AT1. The AT2 receptor, on the other hand, is still an elusive drug target despite multiple studies of its function. Some, but not all, have shown it counteracts the effects of AT1; others point to its potential for tissue protection and regeneration; and still others suggest it could play a role in blocking pain. "There are no approved drugs yet that act on AT2 receptors, but pharmaceutical companies are actively working on developing compounds that will activate or block these receptors," Cherezov said. "One such compound, called EMA401, is being tested in patients for the treatment of neuropathic pain.” In the latest study, Cherezov's team set out to do two things: find out how AT2 differs from AT1, so they can find ways of selectively activating or blocking it; and better understand why AT2 – which like AT1 has all the classic features of a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) – fails to activate G-proteins, which spread signals inside cells, or interact with arrestin, which turns those signals off. Biology Under X-Ray Light In the experiments, the researchers looked at two different kinds of samples, which were formed into crystals for examination with X-rays. In one, the AT2 receptor was bound to a selective compound, one that binds only to AT2. These crystals were so small that they could only be studied at SLAC's X-ray free-electron laser LCLS, where they were streamed across a beam of ultrafast X-ray pulses. In the other, a non-selective compound was bound to both AT1 and AT2. These samples, which formed larger crystals, were probed at Argonne's APS synchrotron light source. APS and LCLS are DOE Office of Science User Facilities. Unexpected Outcomes The results of the experiments were surprising in several ways, according to Cherezov. First, although both compounds were designed to block and deactivate the receptors, they left AT2 in a state that appeared to be active. But on the inward-facing side of AT2, the site where a G-protein would normally bind and spread the signal was blocked. "This basically explains why these receptors do not activate G-proteins," Cherezov said. "They are activated but self-inhibited." In addition, although AT1 and AT2 were thought to be very similar, the pockets where the receptors bind to the compounds exhibited marked differences. "This is something we have never seen with GPCRs," Cherezov said. "The idea was always that receptors that bind to the same compounds would have very similar pockets, so efforts to develop drugs that act on AT2 started with the same basic structures as drugs that act on AT1. Now we see that we may have to start with entirely different drug-like molecules that are tailored to fit the AT2 receptor, which could set the drug discovery process in a different direction." SLAC staff scientist Mark Hunter said, "This kind of room-temperature measurement on interesting membrane protein targets is something that LCLS is well-suited to perform. Membrane proteins remain elusive targets for high-resolution structural studies, and researchers can spend many years trying to obtain crystals that are well ordered and large enough to use at conventional light sources." Researchers from Zhejiang University in China; Merck & Co.; the Center for Free Electron Laser Science at the DESY lab in Germany; and Arizona State University also contributed to the study.
