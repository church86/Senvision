Opdivo wasn’t superior to chemotherapy even in patients with high levels of a protein called PD-L1, which has been thought to be a predictor of how well the immune-system drugs will work, Bristol-Myers said in results presented Sunday at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Copenhagen. The data came from a detailed analysis of the Checkmate-26 study, whose main results were released in August, causing Bristol-Myers’ stock to slump. The results were in stark contrast to the performance of Merck & Co.’s Keytruda in a similar group of patients. Merck’s entire trial was designed around people with high PD-L1 levels, while Bristol-Myers tried to reach a wider range of patients. Bristol-Myers had already announced in August that Opdivo didn’t help the broader group. Sunday’s results showed the treatment didn’t aid the narrower group either. More Women The results were “below expectations,” wrote John Scotti, an analyst at Evercore ISI in New York. Imbalances in the trial, where more women and more people with high PD-L1 levels got chemotherapy, may have skewed the results, said Nick Botwood, the company’s development lead for lung cancer. “The study was designed to ask a very specific question at the 5 percent expression,” Botwood said during a conference call after the data presentation. “It wasn’t designed to ask a question at 50 percent.” He was referring to a measure of how prominent the PD-L1 biomarkers are in a patient’s cancer -- with 50 percent being considered a high level. Sam Fazeli, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, said Bristol-Myers shouldn’t be written off just yet. “No one believes that Opdivo is dead in first line,” Fazeli said in an e-mail. “It’s a drug that has worked in many settings. It’s just that the trial had so many aspects that apparently worked against it.” Merck and Bristol-Myers have been battling for dominance in the new field of immune-oncology, in which medicines are designed to boost the body’s own defenses against cancer. Both drugmakers’ medicines are already approved for people whose lung cancer got worse after initial treatment. The trials presented Sunday would form the basis for approval or rejection as an initial treatment in lung cancer, a much bigger group of potential patients, and could be good news for Merck. “With the right tactical moves, Merck can turn Keytruda into the broadest offering in lung cancer,” said Tim Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE Bristol-Myers Squibb Co Cancer Terms of Service Trademarks Privacy Policy ©2016 Bloomberg L.P.

(NYSE:PFE) today announced data from an ongoing, investigational Phase 1b study of INLYTA (axitinib) combined with the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab (A4061079, NCT02133742), a PD-1 inhibitor known as KEYTRUDA and marketed by Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, in treatment-naïve patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The study was designed to establish dosing and evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of INLYTA when combined with pembrolizumab in first-line treatment of advanced RCC. Preliminary results from a similar, separate study combining INLYTA with avelumab (JAVELIN Renal 100, NCT02493751), an investigational, fully human anti-PD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody that is being co-developed by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer were also presented. The data suggest evidence of anti-tumor activity for INLYTA in combination with avelumab and were presented during a poster discussion session at the ESMO 2016 Congress, the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology being held in Copenhagen, Denmark. Based on these Phase 1 results, two independent global Phase 3 trials evaluating these combinations INLYTA plus pembrolizumab and INLYTA plus avelumab each compared with SUTENT (sunitinib) in first-line advanced RCC are now enrolling patients. "Combining immunotherapy agents with currently approved therapies such as INLYTA may provide a meaningful improvement in outcome for patients with renal cancer," said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., head of immuno-oncology, early development and translational oncology, Pfizer Global Product Development. "The results presented today indicate that there is a potential additive or synergistic effect between INLYTA and a checkpoint inhibitor in RCC." Early indicators from the A4061079 study point to strong response rates with the INLYTA/pembrolizumab combination, with 37 patients (71.2%, confidence internal 56.9, 82.9) achieving objective responses (three complete responses and 34 partial responses); 10 patients had stable disease and 5 patients had disease progression. Separately, in the JAVELIN Renal 100 study of INLYTA in combination with avelumab, five out of six patients treated so far had confirmed partial responses (objective response rate 83.3%, 95% confidence interval: 35.9, 99.6) and one patient with tumor shrinkage not meeting partial response criteria had stable disease. INLYTA is an oral vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor inhibitor for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC after failure of one prior systemic therapy approved in 63 countries. It was the first treatment to demonstrate superior progression-free survival benefit in a Phase 3 study versus sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in second-line treatment of advanced RCC. About Avelumab Avelumab (also known as MSB0010718C) is an investigational fully human anti-PD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody. By inhibiting PD-L1 interactions, avelumab is thought to enable the activation of T-cells and the adaptive immune system. By retaining a native Fc-region, avelumab is thought to potentially engage the innate immune system and induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In November 2014, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Pfizer announced a strategic alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize avelumab. About INLYTA® (axitinib) INLYTA is an oral therapy that is designed to inhibit tyrosine kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors 1, 2 and 3; these receptors can influence tumor growth, vascular angiogenesis and progression of cancer (the spread of tumors). In the U.S., INLYTA is approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after failure of one prior systemic therapy. INLYTA is also approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for use in the EU in adult patients with advanced RCC after failure of prior treatment with sunitinib or a cytokine. INLYTA Important Safety Information Hypertension including hypertensive crisis has been observed. Blood pressure should be well controlled prior to initiating INLYTA. Monitor for hypertension and treat as needed. For persistent hypertension, despite use of antihypertensive medications, reduce the dose. Discontinue INLYTA if hypertension is severe and persistent despite use of antihypertensive therapy and dose reduction of INLYTA, and discontinuation should be considered if there is evidence of hypertensive crisis. Arterial and venous thrombotic events have been observed and can be fatal. Use with caution in patients who are at increased risk or who have a history of these events. Hemorrhagic events, including fatal events, have been reported. INLYTA has not been studied in patients with evidence of untreated brain metastasis or recent active gastrointestinal bleeding and should not be used in those patients. If any bleeding requires medical intervention, temporarily interrupt the INLYTA dose. Cardiac failure has been observed and can be fatal. Monitor for signs or symptoms of cardiac failure throughout treatment with INLYTA. Management of cardiac failure may require permanent discontinuation of INLYTA. Gastrointestinal perforation and fistula, including death, have occurred. Use with caution in patients at risk for gastrointestinal perforation or fistula. Monitor for symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula periodically throughout treatment. Hypothyroidism requiring thyroid hormone replacement has been reported. Monitor thyroid function before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment. No formal studies of the effect of INLYTA on wound healing have been conducted. Stop INLYTA at least 24 hours prior to scheduled surgery. Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) has been observed. If signs or symptoms occur, permanently discontinue treatment. Monitor for proteinuria before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment. For moderate to severe proteinuria, reduce the dose or temporarily interrupt treatment. Liver enzyme elevation has been observed during treatment with INLYTA. Monitor ALT, AST, and bilirubin before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment. For patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the starting dose should be decreased. INLYTA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of potential hazard to the fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving INLYTA. Avoid strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors. If unavoidable, reduce the dose. Grapefruit or grapefruit juice may also increase INLYTA plasma concentrations and should be avoided. Avoid strong CYP3A4/5 inducers and, if possible, avoid moderate CYP3A4/5 inducers. The most common (=20%) adverse events (AEs) occurring in patients receiving INLYTA (all grades, vs sorafenib) were diarrhea (55% vs 53%), hypertension (40% vs 29%), fatigue (39% vs 32%), decreased appetite (34% vs 29%), nausea (32% vs 22%), dysphonia (31% vs 14%), hand-foot syndrome (27% vs 51%), weight decreased (25% vs 21%), vomiting (24% vs 17%), asthenia (21% vs 14%), and constipation (20% vs 20%). The most common (=10%) grade 3/4 AEs occurring in patients receiving INLYTA (vs sorafenib) were hypertension (16% vs 11%), diarrhea (11% vs 7%), and fatigue (11% vs 5%). The most common (=20%) lab abnormalities occurring in patients receiving INLYTA (all grades, vs sorafenib) included increased creatinine (55% vs 41%), decreased bicarbonate (44% vs 43%), hypocalcemia (39% vs 59%), decreased hemoglobin (35% vs 52%), decreased lymphocytes (absolute) (33% vs 36%), increased ALP (30% vs 34%), hyperglycemia (28% vs 23%), increased lipase (27% vs 46%), increased amylase (25% vs 33%), increased ALT (22% vs 22%), and increased AST (20% vs 25%).

HOME > Lifestyle > Health and Fitness 'New day' in lung cancer as Merck drug shines, works with chemo Reuters/Copenhagen Filed on October 9, 2016 Share More > Vote Drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body's natural killer cells to home in on tumours. Merck & Co scored a double hit on Sunday with new clinical data showing its Keytruda immunotherapy offered big benefits in previously untreated lung cancer patients, either when given on its own or with chemotherapy. As a monotherapy, Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy alone in pre-selected patients whose tumours had been tested using a biomarker. And when given with two older chemotherapy drugs in non-selected patients, it was almost twice as likely to shrink tumours as chemotherapy alone. Highlights: *Keytruda cuts risk of death 40 pc in big lung cancer study *Drug also improves outcomes when given with chemotherapy *Immunotherapy changing standard of care in cancer Another similar drug from Roche also demonstrated broad efficacy as a so-called second-line option in patients who had received prior treatment. "Remember this day. It's a new day for lung cancer treatment," Stefan Zimmermann of Lausanne's University Hospital told reporters at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress as the results were presented. An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the Merck monotherapy results were published, said Keytruda could become "a new standard of care". The various findings suggest that treating lung cancer - the biggest cancer killer globally - with powerful new immune system-boosting medicines is going to involve more permutations than some experts originally expected. Rival drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb had tried a catch-all approach with its Opdivo drug but it failed to help previously untreated patients when given on its own in a trial that included people with low levels of a protein called PD-L1. Keytruda, as a sole agent, was targeted only at patients with high PD-L1, making them more receptive to immunotherapy. We feel obligated and honored to do all we can to invent medicines that can help prevent diseases. pic.twitter.com/qSGjAce9XY - Merck (@Merck) October 8, 2016 Proud to share data from three #lungcancer studies today at ESMO 2016. - Merck (@Merck) October 9, 2016 In addition, read about more #lungcancer data: https://t.co/jJjqh0QrZG #immunooncology - Merck (@Merck) October 9, 2016 Lead researcher Martin Reck of Germany's Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf predicted that testing for the PD-L1 biomarker would now become standard "from today". Merck had already said in June that Keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at ESMO. Combination therapy The second trial, mixing Keytruda with chemotherapy, was much smaller but was notable because it was the first time that a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to work in a randomised Phase II study. Many experts have been sceptical about this approach and investors' expectations, up until now, have been quite low. In the event, researchers reported that Merck's combination cut the risk of disease progression or death by 47 per cent compared to chemotherapy alone after 10.6 months, while 55 per cent of patients saw their tumours shrink versus 29 per cent. Patients in this trial were not selected by PD-L1 expression but the study did find that those with higher PD-L1 had a higher response. Roger Perlmutter, Merck's head of research, said both trials suggested Keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy, which is now more than two decades old. Drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body's natural killer cells to home in on tumours. They are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead, with lung cancer the largest market. Up until now, Bristol has dominated the field but investors have started to shift their bets, with forecasts for Opdivo declining while those for Keytruda have risen. The current consensus forecast among analysts is for Keytruda sales to reach $8 billion in 2021, with Opdivo selling $10.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Results of Bristol's failed Opdivo trial, which included patients with tumours testing only 5 percent or higher for PD-L1 against the 50 percent cut-off used by Merck, were also presented at ESMO. These showed progression-free survival was 4.2 months with Opdivo and 5.9 months with chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall survival was 14.4 months with Opdivo versus 13.2 months. The failure of Opdivo to work for "all comers" in lung cancer was first announced in August, without any details. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company's market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments. Many now believe that combination therapy is the way ahead, with Bristol and AstraZeneca working primarily on using two immunotherapies together, while Roche and Merck look at adding chemotherapy.   Share More > Vote   Popular Comments Voted Government Know your Emirates ID privileges and benefits in the UAE 65891 views | 18 February 2016 Transport Dubai businessman buys number plate for Dh33 MILLION 58932 views | 8 October 2016 General Dandiya dancing rocks the night at Navratri celebrations 40236 views | 7 October 2016 Gadgets and Electronics Bag these KILLER deals on last day of GITEX Shopper 27713 views | 7 October 2016 Europe British-Indian stabs wife 124 times over asking for divorce 19348 views | 8 October 2016 Newsmakers Fawad Khan breaks silence on India-Pakistan tensions 16568 views | 7 October 2016 Crime Father refuses to accept 'arrogant teenage girl' 9611 views | 8 October 2016 General Arab woman killed in Dubai accident 8476 views | 8 October 2016 Pakistan Pakistan spy agency chief likely to be replaced: Report 5235 views | 8 October 2016 Education Homework in UAE schools: To ban or not to ban? 4536 views | 8 October 2016 Video | Nation Why people jump Dubai red lights Economy Dubai's non-oil foreign trade at Dh647 billion in H1 2016 0 comments | 8 October 2016 Technology Gitex shoppers pleased with deals 0 comments | 4 October 2016 Football Guardiola says he owes his success to Cruyff 0 comments | 6 October 2016 Abu Dhabi Let the hunting games begin: Adihex 2016 is now open 0 comments | 4 October 2016 Africa Anti-apartheid icon Tutu wants choice of assisted death 0 comments | 7 October 2016 General 9-year-old Emirati girl drowns in RAK 0 comments | 8 October 2016 Rest of Asia Suicide bombings kill at least eight in Baghdad: Officials 0 comments | 3 October 2016 UAE health Sleep well or risk getting cancer 0 comments | 2 October 2016 Music Rolling Stones to release new album in December 0 comments | 6 October 2016 General Dubai ranked among world's TOP 5 shopping cities 9 votes | 8 October 2016 Cricket England beat Bangladesh despite Kayes and Shakib heroics 9 votes | 7 October 2016 Americas Hurricane kills 339, Obama declares emergency 9 votes | 7 October 2016 India India says it foils attack on Kashmir base, kills three militants 9 votes | 6 October 2016 Video | Business Emirates NBD launches futuristic banking...

Many experts have been sceptical about this approach and investors' expectations, up until now, have been quite low. In the event, researchers reported that Merck's combination cut the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent compared to chemotherapy alone after 10.6 months, while 55 percent of patients saw their tumours shrink versus 29 percent. Patients in this trial were not selected by PD-L1 expression but the study did find that those with higher PD-L1 had a higher response. Roger Perlmutter, Merck's head of research, said both trials suggested Keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy, which is now more than two decades old. Drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body's natural killer cells to home in on tumours. They are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead, with lung cancer the largest market. Up until now, Bristol has dominated the field but investors have started to shift their bets, with forecasts for Opdivo declining while those for Keytruda have risen. The current consensus forecast among analysts is for Keytruda sales to reach $8 billion in 2021, with Opdivo selling $10.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Results of Bristol's failed Opdivo trial, which included patients with tumours testing only 5 percent or higher for PD-L1 against the 50 percent cut-off used by Merck, were also presented at ESMO. These showed progression-free survival was 4.2 months with Opdivo and 5.9 months with chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall survival was 14.4 months with Opdivo versus 13.2 months. The failure of Opdivo to work for "all comers" in lung cancer was first announced in August, without any details. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company's market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments. Many now believe that combination therapy is the way ahead, with Bristol and AstraZeneca working primarily on using two immunotherapies together, while Roche and Merck look at adding chemotherapy.

As a monotherapy, Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy alone in pre-selected patients whose tumours had been tested using a biomarker. And when given with two older chemotherapy drugs in non-selected patients, it was almost twice as likely to shrink tumours as chemotherapy alone. Another similar drug from Roche also demonstrated broad efficacy as a so-called second-line option in patients who had received prior treatment. "Remember this day. It's a new day for lung cancer treatment," Stefan Zimmermann of Lausanne's University Hospital told reporters at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress as the results were presented. An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the Merck monotherapy results were published, said Keytruda could become "a new standard of care". The various findings suggest that treating lung cancer - the biggest cancer killer globally - with powerful new immune system-boosting medicines is going to involve more permutations than some experts originally expected. Rival drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb had tried a catch-all approach with its Opdivo drug but it failed to help previously untreated patients when given on its own in a trial that included people with low levels of a protein called PD-L1. Keytruda, as a sole agent, was targeted only at patients with high PD-L1, making them more receptive to immunotherapy. Lead researcher Martin Reck of Germany's Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf predicted that testing for the PD-L1 biomarker would now become standard "from today". U.S. regulators are expected to decide whether to approve Keytruda for first-line non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type, by Dec. 24. Merck had already said in June that Keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at ESMO. COMBINATION THERAPY The second trial, mixing Keytruda with chemotherapy, was much smaller but was notable because it was the first time that a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to work in a randomised Phase II study.

These data were also published today in The New England Journal of Medicine. Based upon the results observed from KEYNOTE-024, to date KEYTRUDA is the only anti-PD-1 to demonstrate superior progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of both squamous and non-squamous NSCLC in patients whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1 and do not express EGFR or ALK genetic aberrations. In KEYNOTE-021, Cohort G, which included patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression level, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) plus chemotherapy (carboplatin plus pemetrexed) achieved a 55 percent objective response rate (ORR) compared to 29 percent for chemotherapy alone, the standard of care, and reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent. To date, KEYTRUDA is the only anti-PD-1 therapy to demonstrate superior efficacy in combination with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone in patients receiving first-line treatment. These data were published today in The Lancet Oncology. “Chemotherapy has been the standard treatment for most patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer for decades, but survival rates remain low,” said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “Our new data suggest that KEYTRUDA treatment can offer meaningful improvement over chemotherapy in a broad array of patients. In this sense, these studies may represent a turning point in worldwide efforts to control lung cancer. We sincerely thank the patients and the clinical investigators for their participation in our studies. Together we are working to improve the health of more and more patients with cancer.” Merck has submitted KEYNOTE-024 data to regulatory agencies in the United States, Europe, and Japan. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Priority Review, with a PDUFA, or target action, date of Dec. 24, 2016. Merck is currently advancing multiple registration-enabling studies in NSCLC with KEYTRUDA as monotherapy and in combination, including the combination of KEYTRUDA plus a platinum/pemetrexed-based chemotherapy regimen in patients with previously untreated, non-squamous NSCLC in the ongoing phase 3 KEYNOTE-189 trial. The KEYTRUDA clinical development program includes more than 350 clinical trials across more than 30 tumor types, including more than 100 trials that combine KEYTRUDA with other cancer treatments. KEYNOTE-024: Data Showed KEYTRUDA was Superior to Chemotherapy for PFS and OS in First-Line Treatment of Metastatic NSCLC KEYNOTE-024 included 305 patients who were previously untreated and whose tumors expressed high levels of PD-L1 (TPS of 50 percent or more). Patients were randomized to receive a 200 mg fixed dose of KEYTRUDA every three weeks (n=154) or four to six cycles of investigator’s choice of one of five platinum-based chemotherapy regimens (n=151): carboplatin or cisplatin plus pemetrexed, carboplatin or cisplatin plus gemcitabine, or carboplatin plus paclitaxel. Pemetrexed maintenance therapy was permitted for patients with non-squamous histologies. Patients randomized to the control arm had the option of crossing over to KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) upon disease progression. The median follow-up was 11.2 months (range, 6.3-19.7). The primary endpoint was PFS; secondary endpoints were OS, ORR, and safety. The findings published in The New England Journal of Medicine demonstrated that KEYTRUDA reduced the risk of progression or death by 50 percent compared to chemotherapy (HR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.37-0.68]; p<0.001). The median PFS for KEYTRUDA was 10.3 months (95% CI, 6.7-not reached) compared to 6.0 months for chemotherapy (95% CI, 4.2-6.2). At six months, 62.1 percent of patients treated with KEYTRUDA were alive and had no disease progression (95% CI, 53.8-69.4) compared to 50.3 percent of those receiving chemotherapy (95% CI, 41.9-58.2). This benefit was observed in all study subgroups. Additionally, KEYTRUDA resulted in a 40 percent reduction in the risk of death compared with chemotherapy (HR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.41-0.89]; p=0.005); this finding includes the 66 patients (43.7%) on the chemotherapy arm who crossed over in-study to receive KEYTRUDA once their cancer had progressed; median OS was not reached in either group. Further, ORR was 44.8 percent for patients receiving KEYTRUDA (95% CI, 36.8-53.0), including six complete responses, compared to 27.8 percent with chemotherapy (95% CI, 20.8-35.7), including one complete response. “These data from KEYNOTE-024 demonstrate the potential of KEYTRUDA to change the way non-small cell lung cancer is currently treated,” said Dr. Martin Reck, head of the thoracic oncology dept., LungenClinic Grosshansdorf, Germany, and lead author of TheNew England Journal of Medicine paper. “This provides additional evidence that testing for PD-L1 levels should become standard in lung cancer at first diagnosis to guide treatment decisions.” Additional Findings and Safety Information from KEYNOTE-024 The safety of KEYTRUDA was consistent with what has been seen in previous trials among patients with metastatic NSCLC. The most common treatment-related adverse events for KEYTRUDA were diarrhea (n=22), fatigue (n=16), and pyrexia (n=16). Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events for KEYTRUDA included diarrhea (n=6) and pneumonitis (n=4). There was one treatment-related death in a patient receiving KEYTRUDA (cause unknown). Additionally, based on an analysis of duration of response, a pre-specified exploratory endpoint, the median duration of response was not reached with KEYTRUDA (range, 1.9+ to 14.5+ months). The median duration of response with the chemotherapy group was 6.3 months (range, 2.1+ to 12.6+). Median time to response was 2.2 months for both groups. About KEYNOTE-024 KEYNOTE-024 is a randomized, phase 3 study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02142738) evaluating KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) as monotherapy compared to standard of care platinum-based chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC. Patients enrolled were those who had received no prior systemic chemotherapy treatment for their advanced disease, whose tumors did not harbor an EGFR sensitizing mutation or ALK translocation, and whose tumors expressed high levels of PD-L1 (TPS of 50 percent or more) as determined by a central laboratory using an FDA approved companion diagnostic, the Dako PD-L1 IHC 22C3 PharmDx test, from Agilent Technologies. KEYNOTE-021, Cohort G: KEYTRUDA Combined with Chemotherapy Showed Higher Response Rates Compared to Chemotherapy Alone as First-Line Treatment of Metastatic NSCLC KEYNOTE-021, Cohort G, included 123 previously untreated patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression and whose tumors did not have EGFR mutations or ALK translocations. Patients were randomized to receive KEYTRUDA plus platinum doublet chemotherapy with pemetrexed and carboplatin (n=60) or platinum doublet chemotherapy alone (n=63). Patients randomized to the chemotherapy-only arm had the option of crossing over to KEYTRUDA monotherapy upon disease progression. The median follow-up was 10.6 months (range, 0.8-19.3). The findings published in The Lancet Oncology demonstrated that ORR nearly doubled by adding KEYTRUDA to chemotherapy, with an ORR of 55 percent (n=33/60) compared to 29 percent (n=18/63) for chemotherapy alone (treatment difference 26%, 95% CI, 9-42%, p=0.0016); all responses were partial. Median duration of response was not reached in either group (range, 1.4+-13.0+ for KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy; 1.4+-15.2+ for chemotherapy alone). Responses in both groups were durable, with 88 percent (n=29/33) of responders in the KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy group and 78 percent (n=14/18) of responders in the chemotherapy alone group experiencing ongoing response at the time of data cut-off. Additionally, the KEYTRUDA combination significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death compared to chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0.53, 95% CI, 0.31-0.91, p=0.0102). Median PFS was 13.0 months with KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy compared to 8.9 months with chemotherapy alone. OS was similar between the two arms, with 92 percent survival at six months in both, and 75 percent and 72 percent survival at 12 months in the KEYTRUDA combination and chemotherapy alone, respectively. Of treated patients on the KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) plus chemotherapy arm, 47 percent remained on treatment as of the cut-off date, compared to 31 percent on chemotherapy alone. Of the treated patients who discontinued treatment on the chemotherapy-only arm, 52 percent (n=32/62) subsequently received anti-PD-L1 therapy, with 32 percent crossing over to KEYTRUDA monotherapy as allowed by the study protocol and 19 percent receiving it outside of study crossover. “The results from KEYNOTE-021 show that pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy nearly doubled the number of patients responding to treatment than chemotherapy alone,” said Dr. Corey Langer, director of thoracic oncology and professor of medicine at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and lead author of The Lancet Oncology paper. “We are now gaining a better understanding that pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy may play an important role in the first-line treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer.” Additional Safety Information from KEYNOTE-021, Cohort G The most common treatment-related adverse events (occurring in at least 15% of patients) for KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy were fatigue, nausea, anemia, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, increased AST, constipation, decreased appetite, increased ALT, dysgeusia, and decreased neutrophils. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events in this arm included fatigue, nausea, anemia, rash, vomiting, increased AST, increased ALT, and decreased neutrophils. The most common immune-mediated adverse events in patients receiving KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy were hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Additionally, pneumonitis, infusion reactions, and severe skin toxicity were noted. These immune-mediated adverse events occurred at similar rates to patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent. There was one treatment-related death from sepsis in a patient receiving KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy, and two (one from sepsis and one from pancytopenia) in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. About KEYNOTE-021, Cohort G Cohort G of the multicenter, open-label, phase 1/2 multi-cohort KEYNOTE-021 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin compared with pemetrexed and carboplatin in patients with metastatic, non-squamous, EGFR- and ALK-negative NSCLC in the first-line treatment setting. Patients were randomized 1:1 to four cycles of KEYTRUDA (200 mg plus carboplatin AUC 5 (5 mg/mL/min) plus pemetrexed 500 mg/m [2 ] every three weeks), or carboplatin plus pemetrexed alone, followed by maintenance pemetrexed with or without KEYTRUDA. Randomization was stratified by PD-L1 expression (positive expression defined as TPS of one percent or more; negative expression defined as TPS of less than one percent). Patients randomized to the chemotherapy arm were allowed to cross over to KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) monotherapy if they experienced disease progression. Response was assessed by blinded, independent central review using RECIST 1.1 every six weeks for the first 18 weeks, every nine weeks through the first year, and every 12 weeks in the second year. The primary endpoint was ORR; secondary endpoints included PFS, duration of response, and OS. About KEYTRUDA [®] (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. KEYTRUDA is administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks for the approved indications. KEYTRUDA for injection is supplied in a 100 mg single use vial. KEYTRUDA Indications and Dosing Melanoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a dose of 2 mg/kg every three weeks. Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1 as determined by an FDA-approved test with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy, at a dose of 2 mg/kg every three weeks. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. An improvement in survival or disease-related symptoms has not yet been established. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. Head and Neck Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA [®]  (pembrolizumab) Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 19 (3.5%) of 550 patients, including Grade 2 (1.1%), 3 (1.3%), 4 (0.4%), or 5 (0.2%) pneumonitis and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5.4%) or prior thoracic radiation (6.0%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 4 (0.7%) of 550 patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%) or 3 (0.4%) colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA. Hypophysitis occurred in 1 (0.2%) of 550 patients, which was Grade 3 in severity. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 10 (1.8%) of 550 patients, including Grade 2 (0.7%) or 3 (0.3%) hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 38 (6.9%) of 550 patients, including Grade 2 (5.5%) or 3 (0.2%) hypothyroidism. Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 3 (0.1%) of 2117 patients. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer anti-hyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. Other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% of 550 patients: rash, vasculitis, hemolytic anemia, serum sickness, and myasthenia gravis. Severe and life-threatening infusion-related reactions have been reported in 3 (0.1%) of 2117 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA. KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 14% of 550 patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were pleural effusion, pneumonia, dyspnea, pulmonary embolism, and pneumonitis. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue (44%), cough (29%), decreased appetite (25%), and dyspnea (23%). It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose. Safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA have not been established in pediatric patients.

These data, from the phase 2/3 KEYNOTE-010 trial, will be presented at the ESMO 2016 Congress, the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology, in Copenhagen(Abstract #LBA48). “These findings – which show superior survival with longer follow-up across patients with PD-L1 expression (tumor proportion score of one percent or more), as well as improved quality of life – point to KEYTRUDA as a durable treatment option for many previously treated patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer,” said Roy S. Herbst, M.D., Ph.D., professor of medicine and chief of medical oncology, Yale Cancer Center and Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale New Haven. “These data also reinforce the value of using PD-L1 as a biomarker to identify patients who are likely to benefit from KEYTRUDA.” In additional data at the ESMO 2016 Congress from KEYNOTE-010, an analysis of patient-reported health-related quality of lifeoutcomes showed more patients treated with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) reported positive outcomes compared to patients treated with chemotherapy (Abstract #1219P). Separately at the ESMO 2016 Congress, researchers presented an analysis of PD-L1 prevalence across three separate studies, including KEYNOTE-010. Overall, 66 percent of patients with metastatic NSCLC expressed any level of PD-L1, and 28 percent expressed high levels of PD-L1 (Abstract #1060P). “Our research in immuno-oncology continues to show tremendous promise, with our goal being to extend the lives of significant numbers of patients with non-small cell lung cancer,” said Roger Dansey, M.D., senior vice president and therapeutic area head, oncology late-stage development, Merck Research Laboratories. “In this longer-term analysis of KEYNOTE-010, among patients who responded to treatment, four times as many patients receiving KEYTRUDA were still alive without disease progression compared to docetaxel. It is gratifying to see these results continue with additional follow-up.” Merck has a robust clinical development program for KEYTRUDA in lung cancer, with multiple registration-enabling studies currently underway. The KEYTRUDA clinical development program includes more than 30 tumor types in more than 350 clinical trials, including more than 100 trials that combine KEYTRUDA with other cancer treatments. Efficacy and Safety Findings from KEYNOTE-010 (Abstract #LBA48) KEYNOTE-010 is a global, open-label, randomized, pivotal phase 2/3 study evaluating KEYTRUDA (2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every three weeks) compared to standard of care chemotherapy (docetaxel, 75 mg/m [2]  every three weeks) in patients with previously treated metastatic NSCLC. The primary endpoints were OS and progression-free survival (PFS) and were assessed based on patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (TPS of one percent or more) and high levels of PD-L1 (TPS of 50 percent or more). Secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response. KEYNOTE-010 is the first study of its kind to evaluate the potential of an immunotherapy compared to chemotherapy based on prospective measurement of PD-L1 expression in patients with metastatic NSCLC. As previously announced, the study met its primary objective, showing that KEYTRUDA significantly improved OS compared to chemotherapy in patients with PD-L1 expression (TPS of one percent or more). Findings were similar in patients who received the FDA-approved dose of KEYTRUDA (2 mg/kg every three weeks) and an investigational dose of KEYTRUDA (10 mg/kg every three weeks). These data also served as the basis for the KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) application approval by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in July of this year and are currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the second-line or greater NSCLC treatment setting. At the ESMO 2016 Congress, data from this study of 1,034 patients included six months of additional follow-up, with a median follow-up of 19.2 months (range, 11.7-29.7), and showed superior outcomes of OS, PFS, and ORR with KEYTRUDA compared to docetaxel in patients with PD-L1 expression (TPS of one percent or more) as well as high levels of PD-L1 expression (TPS of 50 percent or more) – with consistency of outcomes across KEYTRUDA doses. In patients with PD-L1 expression (TPS of one percent or more), OS at 18 months was 37 percent (HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.60-0.87]; p=0.0003) with KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg, 43 percent (HR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.50-0.73]; p<0.00001) with KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg, and 24 percent with docetaxel. Among all patients, median OS was 10.5 months with KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg, 13.6 months with KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg, and 8.6 months with docetaxel. ORR was 19 percent (95% CI, 15-23, p=0.00025) with KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg, 20 percent (95% CI, 16-25, p=0.00004) with KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg and 10 percent (95% CI, 7-13) with docetaxel. Responses to KEYTRUDA continued to be durable; among patients with any level of PD-L1 expression who responded to treatment, 60 percent on each of the KEYTRUDA treatment arms were alive, progression-free, and had not received additional therapy for their disease, compared to 15 percent in the docetaxel treatment arm. In patients with high levels of PD-L1 expression (TPS of 50 percent or more), OS at 18 months was 46 percent (HR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.39-0.73]; p=0.00004) with KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg, 52 percent with KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg (HR, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.35-0.66]; p<0.00001), and 24 percent with docetaxel. In this group, median OS was 15.8 months with KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg, 18.8 months with KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg, and 8.2 months with docetaxel. ORR was 29 percent (95% CI, 22-38, p<0.00001) with KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg, 32 percent (95% CI, 24-40, p<0.00001) with KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg, and nine percent (95% CI, 5-14) with docetaxel. Responses to KEYTRUDA continued to be durable; among patients with high levels of PD-L1 expression who responded to treatment, 68 and 63 percent on the KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg treatment arms, respectively, were alive, progression-free, and had not received additional therapy for their disease, compared to 15 percent in the docetaxel treatment arm. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies of KEYTRUDA. Treatment-related adverse events remained lower with KEYTRUDA compared to docetaxel. Among the total study population, 13, 17, and 36 percent of patients experienced Grades 3-5 treatment-related adverse events with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) 2 mg/kg, KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg, and docetaxel, respectively. Compared with the previous analysis, two additional patients in the KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg arm and five patients in the KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg arm experienced immune-mediated adverse events, none of which led to death. Grade 3-5 immune-mediated adverse events that occurred in two or more patients included pneumonitis (n=14), severe skin toxicities (n=8), and colitis (n=4). Additional immune-mediated adverse events observed in at least two patients in the KEYTRUDA arms of the study included hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, pancreatitis, adrenal insufficiency, myositis, thyroiditis, hepatitis, hypophysitis, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. In this study to date, there have been 10 treatment-related adverse events that led to death, two with KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg, three with KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg, and five with docetaxel. These data will be presented in a poster discussion session on Oct. 9 from 2:45 – 4:15 p.m. CEST (Abstract #LBA48) (location:Oslo). Patient-Reported Outcomes Findings from KEYNOTE-010 (Abstract #1219P) Also reported at the ESMO 2016 Congress were health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes from the KEYNOTE-010 trial. Findings were based on patient-reported assessments using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), EORTC QLQ Lung Cancer 13, and EuroQol-5D-3L instruments to measure for outcomes such as physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social functioning, as well as lung cancer and treatment-related symptoms, among other measures. Overall, from baseline to the 12-week assessment, patients treated with KEYTRUDA (2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every three weeks) reported numeric improvements, some of which were significant, in HRQoL and prolonged time to deterioration of lung cancer symptoms (defined using a composite endpoint of cough, dyspnea, and chest pain) compared with docetaxel (75 mg/m [2]  every three weeks). These findings, along with results from additional patient-reported outcomes analyses, suggest that HRQoL and symptoms were maintained or improved more with KEYTRUDA than with docetaxel. These data were presented in a poster session on Oct. 8 from 1 – 2 p.m. CEST (location:Hall E). PD-L1 Prevalence Findings from KEYNOTE-001, -010, and -024 (Abstract #1060P) Results from a third NSCLC abstract at the ESMO 2016 Congress explored, for the first time, the prevalence of PD-L1 in patients screened across multiple studies. The analysis assessed 4,784 patients with NSCLC who had tumors evaluable for PD-L1 expression and were screened for eligibility in three registrational studies of KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) – KEYNOTE-001, KEYNOTE-010, and KEYNOTE-024. Based on this pooled analysis, 66 percent of patients across all three trials were determined to express PD-L1 (TPS of one percent or more) and 28 percent were determined to have high levels of PD-L1 expression (TPS of 50 percent or more). These findings were similar across demographic and disease characteristics examined, including prior lines of therapy, age, tumor source (primary and metastases), and histology (squamous and non-squamous). These data will be presented in a poster session on Oct. 9 from 1 – 2 p.m. CEST (location:Hall E). About KEYTRUDA [®] (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. KEYTRUDA is administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks for the approved indications. KEYTRUDA for injection is supplied in a 100 mg single use vial. KEYTRUDA Indications and Dosing Melanoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a dose of 2 mg/kg every three weeks. Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1 as determined by an FDA-approved test with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy, at a dose of 2 mg/kg every three weeks. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. An improvement in survival or disease-related symptoms has not yet been established. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. Head and Neck Cancer KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA [®]  (pembrolizumab) Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 19 (3.5%) of 550 patients, including Grade 2 (1.1%), 3 (1.3%), 4 (0.4%), or 5 (0.2%) pneumonitis and occurred more frequently in patients with a history of asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5.4%) or prior thoracic radiation (6.0%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 4 (0.7%) of 550 patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%) or 3 (0.4%) colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA. Hypophysitis occurred in 1 (0.2%) of 550 patients, which was Grade 3 in severity. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 10 (1.8%) of 550 patients, including Grade 2 (0.7%) or 3 (0.3%) hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 38 (6.9%) of 550 patients, including Grade 2 (5.5%) or 3 (0.2%) hypothyroidism. Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 3 (0.1%) of 2117 patients. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer anti-hyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. Other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% of 550 patients: rash, vasculitis, hemolytic anemia, serum sickness, and myasthenia gravis. Severe and life-threatening infusion-related reactions have been reported in 3 (0.1%) of 2117 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab). KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 14% of 550 patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were pleural effusion, pneumonia, dyspnea, pulmonary embolism, and pneumonitis. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 20% of patients) were fatigue (44%), cough (29%), decreased appetite (25%), and dyspnea (23%). It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose. Safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA have not been established in pediatric patients.

As a monotherapy, Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy alone in pre-selected patients whose tumours had been tested using a biomarker. In contrast to rival Bristol-Myers Squibb, whose Opdivo drug failed to help such first-line patients, Keytruda was targeted at people who express high levels of a protein called PD-L1, which makes them more receptive to immunotherapy. U.S. regulators are expected to decide whether to approve Keytruda for first-line non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type, by Dec. 24. Merck had already said in June that Keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at the annual European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress. The second trial, mixing Keytruda with chemotherapy, was much smaller but was notable because it was the first time that a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to work in a randomised Phase II study. Many experts have been sceptical about this approach and investors' expectations, up until now, have been quite low. In the event, researchers reported that Merck's combination cut the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent compared to chemotherapy alone after 10.6 months, while 55 percent of patients saw their tumours shrink versus 29 percent. Patients in this trial were not selected by PD-L1 expression but the study did find that those with higher PD-L1 had a higher response. Roger Perlmutter, Merck's head of research, said both trials suggested Keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy, which is now more than two decades old. Drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body's natural killer cells to home in on tumours. They are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead, with lung cancer, the biggest cancer killer globally, viewed as the largest market. Results of Bristol's failed Opdivo trial, which included patients with tumours testing only 5 percent or higher for PD-L1 against the 50 percent cut-off used by Merck, were also presented at ESMO. These showed progression-free survival was 4.2 months with Opdivo and 5.9 months with chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall survival was 14.4 months with Opdivo versus 13.2 months. The failure of Opdivo to work for "all comers" in lung cancer was first announced in August, without any details. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company's market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments. Many now believe that combination therapy is the way ahead, with Bristol and AstraZeneca working primarily on using two immunotherapies together, while Roche and Merck look at adding chemotherapy. Results of Merck's two trials were published online in the New England Journal of Medicine and the Lancet Oncology journal.

Results presented at the ESMO 2016 Congress, the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology, in Copenhagen include follow-up of up to 35 months for the study's co-primary endpoints of OS and progression-free survival (PFS). Data showed prolonged OS with KEYTRUDA (2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg), with a median OS of 13.4 months and 14.7 months and a two-year OS rate of 35.9 percent and 38.2 percent, respectively, compared to a median OS of 11.0 months and a two-year OS rate of 29.7 percent with chemotherapy. "Now, with longer follow-up, we continue to show clinically meaningful outcomes with KEYTRUDA as monotherapy in these ipilimumab-refractory patients," said Dr. Roger Dansey, senior vice president, oncology late-stage development, Merck Research Laboratories. "These results provide further evidence supporting the use of KEYTRUDA as a standard of care for patients with advanced melanoma." Today, KEYTRUDA is approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma in more than 50 countries, including the United States and throughout Europe. The KEYTRUDA clinical development program includes more than 30 tumor types in more than 350 clinical studies, including more than 100 trials that combine KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) with other cancer treatments. The final analysis from KEYNOTE-002 is being presented at the ESMO 2016 Congress by Dr. Omid Hamid, director of the Melanoma Center at The Angeles Clinic and Research Institute, on Oct. 8 from 2:45 4:15 p.m. CEST (Abstract: #1107O). Additional Findings from KEYNOTE-002 KEYNOTE-002 is a multicenter, randomized, controlled phase 2 study of KEYTRUDA (2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every three weeks) compared to investigator's choice chemotherapy (paclitaxel plus carboplatin, paclitaxel, carboplatin, dacarbazine, or temozolomide) in patients with ipilimumab-refractory advanced melanoma (n=540). The co-primary endpoints were PFS and OS; secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), duration of response, and safety. Tumor response was assessed at week 12, then every six weeks through week 48, followed by every 12 weeks thereafter as assessed by independent central review using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Per the study protocol, after three months, patients who experienced disease progression on the chemotherapy arm were eligible to cross over to receive KEYTRUDA. In total, 55 percent (n=98/179) of patients in the chemotherapy arm crossed over to receive KEYTRUDA monotherapy. In the final analysis, which included the 98 patients who crossed over from the chemotherapy arm to receive KEYTRUDA, the median OS was 13.4 months with KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg (95% CI, 11.0-16.4 months) and 14.7 months with KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg (95% CI 11.3-19.5 months), compared to 11.0 months with chemotherapy (95% CI, 8.9-13.8 months) (hazard ratio: 0.86 [95% CI, 0.67-1.10; p=0.1173] and hazard ratio: 0.74 [95% CI, 0.57-0.96; p=0.0106], respectively); the two-year (24-month) OS rate was 35.9 percent and 38.2 percent with KEYTRUDA (2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively), compared to 29.7 percent with chemotherapy. While improvements in OS between KEYTRUDA (2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) and chemotherapy did not meet the protocol-specified significance threshold, longer follow-up continued to show a clinically meaningful improvement in PFS, the study's co-primary endpoint, with PFS of up to 31 months in patients treated with KEYTRUDA. Median PFS was approximately three months for each of the patient groups (95% CI of 2.8-3.8 months with KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg; 95% CI of 2.8-5.2 months with KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg; and 95% CI of 2.6-2.8 months with chemotherapy) (hazard ratio: 0.58 [95% CI, 0.46-0.73; p<0.0001] and hazard ratio: 0.47 [95% CI, 0.37-0.60; p<0.0001], respectively). The two-year PFS rate was 16.0 percent and 21.9 percent with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) (2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively), compared to less than one percent (0.6 percent) of patients treated with chemotherapy. ORR was 22.2 percent and 27.6 percent with KEYTRUDA (2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively), compared to 4.5 percent with chemotherapy. At the time of analysis, 50 percent and 58 percent of patients who responded to KEYTRUDA (2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively) were alive with no subsequent progression or anti-tumor therapy, compared to 12 percent of patients who responded to chemotherapy. With longer follow-up, adverse events have remained consistent with previously reported safety data. Treatment-related immune-mediated adverse events of Grade 3-4 were pneumonitis, colitis (10 mg/kg only), adrenal insufficiency, severe skin toxicity, hypophysitis, hepatitis, nephritis (2 mg/kg only), pancreatitis (10 mg/kg only), and myasthenia (10 mg/kg only). About Melanoma Melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of pigment-producing cells. The incidence of melanoma has been increasing over the past four decades approximately 232,000 new cases were diagnosed worldwide in 2012. In the U.S., melanoma is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed and is responsible for the vast majority of skin cancer deaths. In 2016, an estimated 76,380 people are expected to be diagnosed and an estimated 10,130 people are expected to die of the disease in the U.S. alone. The five-year survival rates for advanced or metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) are estimated to be 15 to 20 percent. About KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. KEYTRUDA is administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks for the approved indications. KEYTRUDA for injection is supplied in a 100 mg single use vial. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) Indications and Dosing Melanoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a dose of 2 mg/kg every three weeks. Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1 as determined by an FDA-approved test with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy, at a dose of 2 mg/kg every three weeks. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. An improvement in survival or disease-related symptoms has not yet been established. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. Head and Neck Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in Melanoma Immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases, occurred in patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Pneumonitis occurred in 32 (2.0%) of 1567 patients, including Grade 1 (0.8%), 2 (0.8%), and 3 (0.4%) pneumonitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. Evaluate suspected pneumonitis with radiographic imaging. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 or recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 31 (2%) of 1567 patients, including Grade 2 (0.5%), 3 (1.1%), and 4 (0.1%) colitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of colitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater colitis. Withhold KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) for Grade 2 or 3; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 4 colitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 16 (1%) of 1567 patients, including Grade 2 (0.1%), 3 (0.7%), and 4 (0.1%) hepatitis. Monitor patients for changes in liver function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater hepatitis and, based on severity of liver enzyme elevations, withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA. Hypophysitis occurred in 13 (0.8%) of 1567 patients, including Grade 2 (0.3%), 3 (0.3%), and 4 (0.1%) hypophysitis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis (including hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency). Administer corticosteroids and hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; withhold or discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 hypophysitis. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 51 (3.3%) of 1567 patients, including Grade 2 (0.6%) and 3 (0.1%) hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 127 (8.1%) of 1567 patients, including Grade 3 (0.1%) hypothyroidism. Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. Administer replacement hormones for hypothyroidism and manage hyperthyroidism with thionamides and beta-blockers as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 hyperthyroidism. Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in 3 (0.1%) of 2117 patients. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Administer insulin for type 1 diabetes, and withhold KEYTRUDA and administer anti-hyperglycemics in patients with severe hyperglycemia. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 7 (0.4%) of 1567 patients, including Grade 2 (0.2%), 3 (0.2%), and 4 (0.1%) nephritis. Monitor patients for changes in renal function. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater nephritis. Withhold KEYTRUDA for Grade 2; permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for Grade 3 or 4 nephritis. Other clinically important immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur. For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold KEYTRUDA and administer corticosteroids. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Based on limited data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants can be considered. Resume KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) when the adverse reaction remains at Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA for any Grade 3 immune-mediated adverse reaction that recurs and for any life-threatening immune-mediated adverse reaction. The following clinically significant, immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% (unless otherwise indicated) of 1567 patients: arthritis (1.6%), exfoliative dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, and partial seizures arising in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma. Severe and life-threatening infusion-related reactions have been reported in 3 (0.1%) of 2117 patients. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. For Grade 3 or 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant during treatment, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of KEYTRUDA. In KEYNOTE-002, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 12% of 357 patients; the most common (=1%) were general physical health deterioration (1%), asthenia (1%), dyspnea (1%), pneumonitis (1%), and generalized edema (1%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 14% of patients; the most common (=1%) were dyspnea (1%), diarrhea (1%), and maculopapular rash (1%). The most common adverse reactions with KEYTRUDA vs chemotherapy were fatigue (43% with KEYTRUDA), pruritus (28% vs 8%), rash (24% vs 8%), constipation (22% vs 20%), nausea (22% with KEYTRUDA), diarrhea (20% vs 20%), and decreased appetite (20% with KEYTRUDA). Corresponding incidence rates are listed for chemotherapy only for those adverse reactions that occurred at the same or lower rate than with KEYTRUDA It is not known whether KEYTRUDA is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, instruct women to discontinue nursing during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the final dose. Safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA have not been established in pediatric patients.

Data presented at the ESMO 2016 Congress, the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology, showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 24 percent (n=24/100) (95% CI, 16-34) in the total study population, which included patients with and without PD-L1 expression. “We have a growing body of evidence of KEYTRUDA’s activity in a range of cancers and treatment settings including the first-line treatment of patients with advanced urothelial cancer who will not tolerate cisplatin-based therapy,” said Dr. Roger Dansey, senior vice president, oncology late-stage development, Merck Research Laboratories. The KEYTRUDA clinical development program includes more than 30 tumor types in more than 350 clinical studies, including more than 100 trials that combine KEYTRUDA with other cancer treatments. Merck has the largest immuno-oncology clinical development program in bladder cancer with 27 trials involving KEYTRUDA, including four registration-enabling studies currently underway. “There have been very few advancements in the treatment of bladder cancer in the past several decades, and patients with urothelial cancer who are ineligible for cisplatin-based therapy are in significant need of new approaches to care,” said Dr. Dean F. Bajorin, study investigator and medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. “These data are exciting and demonstrate the potential for an anti-PD-1 therapy, such as pembrolizumab, to address the unmet treatment need that exists today for cisplatin-ineligible patients with this type of urothelial cancer.” Findings from KEYNOTE-052 are being presented at the ESMO 2016 Congress by Dr. Arjun V. Balar, medical oncologist and assistant professor of medicine at the Perlmutter Cancer Center at NYU Langone Medical Center, on Oct. 8 from 9:30 – 9:45 a.m. CEST (abstract:# LBA32_PR) and are featured in the official ESMO press program. Additional Findings from KEYNOTE-052 KEYNOTE-052 is an open-label, phase 2 study evaluating KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) (200 mg every three weeks) monotherapy as a first-line treatment in an estimated 350 patients with unresectable (inoperable) or metastatic urothelial cancer (a type of bladder cancer) who are ineligible for cisplatin-based therapy. The primary endpoints include ORR in all patients enrolled in the study (total study population) and in patients with PD-L1 positive tumors (expression of one percent or more). Secondary endpoints include duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Tumor response was measured according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) v1.1 as assessed by blinded independent central review. Findings presented at the ESMO 2016 Congress are from the planned interim analysis of the first 100 patients, which was intended to evaluate ORR and determine the PD-L1-high expression cut-point as examined by expression in tumor and immune cells. Forty-five percent of patients (n=45/100) had an ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) Performance Status (PS) score of two, 30 percent (n=30/100) had a PS score of one, and 24 percent (n=24/100) had a PS score of zero. In the total study population, ORR was 24 percent (n=24/100) (95% CI, 16-34) with a complete response rate of six percent (n=6/100) (95% CI, 2-13). Review of the outcomes based on PD-L1 expression showed that in patients with PD-L1 expression of less than one percent, ORR was 18 percent (n=6/33) (95% CI, 7-36) with a complete response rate of three percent (n=1/33) (95% CI, 0.1-16); in patients with PD-L1 expression greater than or equal to one percent and less than 10 percent, ORR was 15 percent (n=5/33) (95% CI, 5-32) with no complete responses; and, in patients expressing PD-L1 at levels equal to or greater than 10 percent, ORR was 37 percent (n=11/30) (95% CI, 20-56) with a complete response rate of 13 percent (n=4/30) (95% CI, 4-31). Among the 24 percent of patients in the total study population who were responding to treatment, the median duration of response had not been reached (range 1.4+ to 9.8+ months), with 83 percent of patients (n=20/24) having responses of six months or longer. The safety profile of KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) was consistent with that observed in previously reported KEYTRUDA studies. The treatment-related adverse events observed in this trial (any grade occurring in five percent or more of patients) were fatigue (n=14), pruritus (n=12), pyrexia (n=8), decreased appetite (n=7), diarrhea (n=7), rash (n=7), chills (n=6), hypothyroidism (n=6), and nausea (n=6). Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events observed (occurring in 2 or more patients) were fatigue (n=4), muscle spasms (n=2), decreased appetite (n=1), and diarrhea (n=1). Immune-mediated adverse events of Grade 3-4 were nephritis (n=1) and pneumonitis (n=2). Five patients discontinued due to a treatment-related adverse event; there were no treatment-related deaths. About Bladder Cancer Bladder cancer begins when cells in the urinary bladder start to grow uncontrollably. As more cancer cells develop, they can form a tumor and spread to other areas of the body. Urothelial carcinoma, the most common type of bladder cancer, starts in the urothelial cells that line the inside of the bladder. In 2012, approximately 430,000 people worldwide were diagnosed with bladder cancer and 165,000 died from the disease. The incidence of bladder cancer is elevated in North America, Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Australia and New Zealand. About KEYTRUDA [®] (pembrolizumab) KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. KEYTRUDA is administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every three weeks for the approved indications. KEYTRUDA for injection is supplied in a 100 mg single use vial. KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) Indications and Dosing Melanoma KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma at a dose of 2 mg/kg every three weeks. Lung Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1 as determined by an FDA-approved test with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy, at a dose of 2 mg/kg every three weeks. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving KEYTRUDA. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. An improvement in survival or disease-related symptoms has not yet been established. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials. Head and Neck Cancer KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.

As a monotherapy, Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy alone in pre-selected patients whose tumours had been tested using a biomarker. And when given with two older chemotherapy drugs in non-selected patients, it was almost twice as likely to shrink tumours as chemotherapy alone. Another similar drug from Roche also demonstrated broad efficacy as a so-called second-line option in patients who had received prior treatment. “Remember this day. It’s a new day for lung cancer treatment,” Stefan Zimmermann of Lausanne’s University Hospital told reporters at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress as the results were presented. An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the Merck monotherapy results were published, said Keytruda could become “a new standard of care”. The various findings suggest that treating lung cancer – the biggest cancer killer globally – with powerful new immune system-boosting medicines is going to involve more permutations than some experts originally expected. Rival drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb had tried a catch-all approach with its Opdivo drug but it failed to help previously untreated patients when given on its own in a trial that included people with low levels of a protein called PD-L1. Keytruda, as a sole agent, was targeted only at patients with high PD-L1, making them more receptive to immunotherapy. Lead researcher Martin Reck of Germany’s Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf predicted that testing for the PD-L1 biomarker would now become standard “from today”. US regulators are expected to decide whether to approve Keytruda for first-line non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type, by Dec. 24. Merck had already said in June that Keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at ESMO. COMBINATION THERAPY The second trial, mixing Keytruda with chemotherapy, was much smaller but was notable because it was the first time that a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to work in a randomised Phase II study. Many experts have been skeptical about this approach and investors’ expectations, up until now, have been quite low. In the event, researchers reported that Merck’s combination cut the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent compared to chemotherapy alone after 10.6 months, while 55 percent of patients saw their tumours shrink versus 29 percent. Patients in this trial were not selected by PD-L1 expression but the study did find that those with higher PD-L1 had a higher response. Roger Perlmutter, Merck’s head of research, said both trials suggested Keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy, which is now more than two decades old. Drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body’s natural killer cells to home in on tumors. They are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead, with lung cancer the largest market. Up until now, Bristol has dominated the field but investors have started to shift their bets, with forecasts for Opdivo declining while those for Keytruda have risen. The current consensus forecast among analysts is for Keytruda sales to reach $8 billion in 2021, with Opdivo selling $10.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Results of Bristol’s failed Opdivo trial, which included patients with tumours testing only 5 percent or higher for PD-L1 against the 50 percent cut-off used by Merck, were also presented at ESMO. These showed progression-free survival was 4.2 months with Opdivo and 5.9 months with chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall survival was 14.4 months with Opdivo versus 13.2 months. The failure of Opdivo to work for “all comers” in lung cancer was first announced in August, without any details. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company’s market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments. Many now believe that combination therapy is the way ahead, with Bristol and AstraZeneca working primarily on using two immunotherapies together, while Roche and Merck look at adding chemotherapy. – Reuters Share This article was published on 09/10/2016 Most Read Four Americans killed in US base attack in Afghanistan Anger as millions in India run out of cash Prostitutes caught Woman set on fire in Japan restaurant Man murders wife with hammer, screwdrivers 13th Nov 12th Nov Govt austerity measures top election campaigns Court confirms royal can run in polls 45 ATVs impounded in traffic police crackdown Business Cartoon E-Paper Health Kuwait Legal Clinic Lifestyle Opinion Sports Technology Top Stories World About Us Contact Us Rate card 2016 RSS © 2016, ↑ Kuwait Times

X Lung cancer drug fails to show advantage in clinical trial Bristol-Myers Squibb immunotherapy drug fails to beat chemotherapy in large trial Sun, Oct 9, 2016, 19:14 Updated: Sun, Oct 9, 2016, 19:56 A new drug from Bristol-Myers Squibb that turns the body into a weapon against cancer failed to beat chemotherapy in a large head-to-head clinical trial.         A new drug from Bristol-Myers Squibb that turns the body into a weapon against cancer failed to beat chemotherapy in a large head-to-head clinical trial, marking the biggest setback for the hot new field of immunotherapy. Opdivo, a type of immunotherapy known as a checkpoint inhibitor, had been tipped as a replacement for chemotherapy for patients suffering from advanced lung cancer, but a study published on Sunday showed the new medicine is inferior to the established treatment. Those taking Opdivo typically survived for just over four months before the disease worsened, whereas those who received chemotherapy went for six months before the cancer progressed, according to the trial of 541 patients. Opdivo is already approved for non small-cell lung cancer patients who have tried chemotherapy, but Bristol-Myers had hoped the medicine would usurp the poisonous cocktail to become the first drug of choice for oncologists treating newly-diagnosed patients. “We thought Opdivo could beat chemotherapy, and we have answered the question: for the broad population it is not enough,” said Fouad Namouni, oncology development head at Bristol-Myers. Hopeful Mr Namouni said he was hopeful that adding Opdivo to an older Bristol-Myers immunotherapy, Yervoy, would be more effective than chemotherapy, but a large study testing that combination is not expected to be completed until 2018. Lung cancer is the most common and deadliest form of the disease, with 535,000 patients diagnosed each year in Europe and the US, and roughly 85 per cent of cases involve non small-cell tumours. Perrigo to review options for multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri Northern Irish firm Almac plans €23m US facility expansion AstraZeneca predicts major US healthcare changes under Trump By the time most patients are diagnosed, they are already suffering from advanced disease, and roughly 95 per cent die within five years. Bristol-Myers first warned its drug had flunked the trial in August, prompting investors to wipe more than $23 billion off the value of the US pharmaceuticals group – but it did not reveal the full scale of the failure until Sunday. ADVERTISEMENT The company published the study at the annual meeting of the European Society of Medical Oncology in Copenhagen, where oncologists gathered to pore over research from pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. Delegates at the meeting heard more positive news from Merck, another US drugmaker that has been engaged in a two-horse race with Bristol-Myers to develop checkpoint inhibitors, which work by removing brakes on the immune system so it can attack cancer. Merck published a large, late-stage study of its drug, Keytruda, which it tested in a group of patients who were selected for the trial because they were thought to be more likely to respond to the drug. These patients had tumours with very high levels of a substance known as PD-L1, a characteristic shared by somewhere between 25 and 30 per cent of all people suffering from non small-cell lung cancer. In Merck’s trial, patients taking Keytruda typically went for more than 10 months before their cancer worsened, compared with six months for those receiving chemotherapy. About 45 per cent of patients either saw their tumours disappear entirely or shrink substantially, compared with 28 per cent on chemotherapy. FDA approval Merck has submitted Keytruda for approval in untreated lung cancer patients, and the US Food and Drug Administration is expected to give the drug the green light at the end of December. The success of Merck’s trial is a vindication of the company’s embrace of an emerging field of science known as precision medicine, where drugs are targeted at smaller subgroups of patients who are most likely to benefit. Conversely, Bristol-Myers tested Opdivo in a wider pool of patients, a strategy which would have resulted in higher prescriptions and drug sales had the trial been successful. Merck published another small trial in which patients were given Keytruda and chemotherapy simultaneously, which suggested that this combination could be more effective than either single regimen. In the study of 123 people, patients who took both drugs at the same time went for 13 months without their cancer getting worse, with 55 per cent of them experiencing a remission or substantial tumour shrinkage, compared with 29 per cent for chemotherapy alone. Dr Roger Perlmutter, Merck’s top scientist, said the findings from both studies showed that immunotherapies were “becoming foundational in the way that we treat cancer”. – (Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2016)       Topics: Bristol-Myers Squibb Merck Read More Glaxo sues Pfizer Ireland over alleged patent infringement Sales at Endo jump 18.6% on demand for generic drugs Debt-laden Valeant Pharmaceuticals cuts full-year forecast Venn Life Sciences wins €2.5m clinical trials contract GSK takes case against Pfizer over meningococcal vaccine Kinesis Health Technologies raises €590,000 in funding Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy Pound raises cost of Britain’s EU budget contribution Retail & Services Irish shoppers should rise up over UK retailers’ levy International Gerry Thornley: Focus returns to showdown with All Blacks Health Against the odds: becoming a mum with muscular dystrophy Sponsored My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa Power up your company's pension plan Designed for life: Helen James on creativity and a life InSync ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Lansdowne Road deal needs correction, says union chief 21:32 Councils losing revenue due to rates assessment backlog 20:28 The big business events coming up in the week ahead 19:12 In the news: Arnotts’ bumper year and Clare crematorium 18:09 Pound raises cost of Britain’s EU budget contribution 17:27 ADVERTISEMENT Most Read in Business 1 How to . . . fix Apple’s iOS 10’s annoying features 2 The big business events coming up in the week ahead 3 Standard Chartered weighs private-equity investments 4 Irish shoppers should rise up over UK retailers’ levy 5 Irish businesses get chance to pitch to Richard Branson 6 Unlocking the blockchain enigma 7 Trump’s plans won’t damage US investment in Ireland, Noonan says 8 Panama Papers shine a light on Ireland’s SPVs 9 Planning weddings in the United Arab Emirates 10 Small talk makes a big difference to your career Never miss a story.

Early results evaluating five patients with metastatic melanoma for efficacy and 16 patients for safety were reported. In patients naïve to anti-PD-1 treatment objective responses were observed in three out of four (75%) including one complete response (CR) and two partial responses (PR's). One patient with progressive disease while receiving anti-PD-1 therapy was observed to have stable disease (SD). These data were presented in a poster session on Sunday at the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) Annual Congress 2016 in Copenhagen, Denmark. SD-101 in combination with pembrolizumab was well-tolerated. No dose-limiting toxicities of the combination were observed in any dose cohort, and a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not identified. No immune-related adverse events were reported, and the most common treatment-emergent adverse events were grade 1-2 flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills and myalgia consistent with the engagement of TLR9 and production of interferon alpha. The study also included biomarker assessments suggesting that treatment with SD-101 and pembrolizumab resulted in elevation of gene signatures consistent with an increase in immune cell types and multiple immune functions. About MEL-01 (KEYNOTE-184) The ongoing dose-escalation and expansion study of SD-101 in combination with pembrolizumab includes patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable Stage IIIc/IV melanoma. The primary endpoints of the trial are MTD and evaluation of the safety of intratumoral SD-101 in combination with pembrolizumab. In addition, the trial is evaluating response as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, biomarker assessments and duration of response. Patients previously treated with anti-PD-1 and other immunotherapies are included. About SD-101 SD-101 is Dynavax's proprietary, second-generation, Toll-like Receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist CpG-C class oligodeoxynucleotide. SD-101 activates multiple anti-tumor activities of innate immune cells and activates plasmacytoid dendritic cells to stimulate T cells specific for antigens released from dying tumor cells. TLR9 agonists such as SD-101 enhance T and B cell responses and provide potent Type 1 interferon induction and maturation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells to antigen-presenting cells. SD-101 is being evaluated in several Phase 1/2 oncology studies to assess its preliminary safety and activity.

REUTERS/Alex Domanski/File PhotoMore By Ben Hirschler COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Merck & Co scored a double hit on Sunday with new clinical data showing its Keytruda immunotherapy offered big benefits in previously untreated lung cancer patients, either when given on its own or with chemotherapy. As a monotherapy, Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy alone in pre-selected patients whose tumours had been tested using a biomarker. And when given with two older chemotherapy drugs in non-selected patients, it was almost twice as likely to shrink tumours as chemotherapy alone. Another similar drug from Roche also demonstrated broad efficacy as a so-called second-line option in patients who had received prior treatment. "Remember this day. It's a new day for lung cancer treatment," Stefan Zimmermann of Lausanne's University Hospital told reporters at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress as the results were presented. An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the Merck monotherapy results were published, said Keytruda could become "a new standard of care". The various findings suggest that treating lung cancer - the biggest cancer killer globally - with powerful new immune system-boosting medicines is going to involve more permutations than some experts originally expected. Rival drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb had tried a catch-all approach with its Opdivo drug but it failed to help previously untreated patients when given on its own in a trial that included people with low levels of a protein called PD-L1. Keytruda, as a sole agent, was targeted only at patients with high PD-L1, making them more receptive to immunotherapy. Lead researcher Martin Reck of Germany's Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf predicted that testing for the PD-L1 biomarker would now become standard "from today". U.S. regulators are expected to decide whether to approve Keytruda for first-line non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type, by Dec. 24. Merck had already said in June that Keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at ESMO. COMBINATION THERAPY The second trial, mixing Keytruda with chemotherapy, was much smaller but was notable because it was the first time that a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to work in a randomised Phase II study. Many experts have been sceptical about this approach and investors' expectations, up until now, have been quite low. In the event, researchers reported that Merck's combination cut the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent compared to chemotherapy alone after 10.6 months, while 55 percent of patients saw their tumours shrink versus 29 percent. Patients in this trial were not selected by PD-L1 expression but the study did find that those with higher PD-L1 had a higher response. Roger Perlmutter, Merck's head of research, said both trials suggested Keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy, which is now more than two decades old. Drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body's natural killer cells to home in on tumours. They are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead, with lung cancer the largest market. Up until now, Bristol has dominated the field but investors have started to shift their bets, with forecasts for Opdivo declining while those for Keytruda have risen. The current consensus forecast among analysts is for Keytruda sales to reach $8 billion in 2021, with Opdivo selling $10.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Results of Bristol's failed Opdivo trial, which included patients with tumours testing only 5 percent or higher for PD-L1 against the 50 percent cut-off used by Merck, were also presented at ESMO. These showed progression-free survival was 4.2 months with Opdivo and 5.9 months with chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall survival was 14.4 months with Opdivo versus 13.2 months. The failure of Opdivo to work for "all comers" in lung cancer was first announced in August, without any details. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company's market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments. Many now believe that combination therapy is the way ahead, with Bristol and AstraZeneca working primarily on using two immunotherapies together, while Roche and Merck look at adding chemotherapy.

Patients in the study -- most of whom were men, and had a history of smoking -- had already tried at least one other therapy unsuccessfully. Roche’s results come amid intense interest in medicines that harness the immune system to help fight lung cancer. Tecentriq would compete with recently-approved treatments from Merck & Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Both U.S. drugmakers just finished trials in a much bigger group of patients: those who are treated for the first time. Bristol’s drug failed and Merck’s succeeded in results presented alongside Roche’s at the conference on Sunday. Importantly, Tecentriq also helped patients whose immune systems didn’t already show a strong response before treatment, said Dan Chen, the Swiss drugmaker’s head of cancer immunotherapy development. Patients who already had a strong immunity responded even better to the drug, Chen said. They lived a median of more than 20 months, compared with a 8.9 months for those on chemotherapy, in the Roche-funded study. “The survival benefit that we’re seeing here is unprecedented,” Chen said in a telephone interview. “This forms the foundation of our cancer immunotherapy development. Tecentriq will be used as a single agent but also in combination in the future.” Tecentriq was approved in May for advanced bladder cancer, and Roche expects a ruling from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in lung cancer by the middle of next week. The drug may have about 2.15 billion francs ($2.19 billion) in sales in 2019, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

They will reason that companies are only responsible to their shareholders for profits October 10, 2016, 3:09 am SHARE : Talha Afzal Tweet Daraprim, a drug that is the de facto standard of care for treating life threatening infections went from $13.75 to $750 overnight. The drug that was initially marketed at $1 a pop in 2009 is also used by transplant and AIDS patients. Although the drug price is down to $375 now after the arrest of the controversial CEO who was responsible for price hike, it is still very expensive considering the need to be administered every day (for years). The outrageous hike that left patients devastated gives rise to one and only one question: should profit motive be the only purpose of corporate existence? Take a look at Merck and Company, a pharmaceutical company that was faced with a somewhat similar situation many years ago. The company could develop a drug that could potentially save many lives but presented little to no opportunity of earning a return on investment.  The disease, known as river blindness, was agonizing: worms curled up as noodles under the skin causing intense itching, lesions, blindness, and eventually death. Most victims however ended up committing suicide before the final stage. It affected 18 million impoverished people in Africa and Latin America. The name of the drug was Ivermectin and it was being marketed by Merck as an animal drug. It would cost the company $100 million to develop the human version of the drug. The problem was three-fold: First, the company may never be able to recoup the investment because the victims of the disease were poor. Secondly, if the drug affected humans adversely, sales of the animal version, which was a major source of revenue, would also plummet. Third, the government was getting ready to pass a law that would allow competing pharmaceuticals to copy drug formulas sooner than they previously could and market it as their own. This would intensify competition leaving Merck with slim to no chance of recouping the initial losses on the product. Did Merck have a duty to develop the product? There is no easy answer to the dichotomy but the managers thought it did. Some of them even went so far as dispensing the drug for free.  This may have looked counter-intuitive given most businesses desire profitability over philanthropy but commentators argued that Merck would benefit from the act of kindness in the longer run. Merck did what was right. But will every company? Most companies will flake out at the thought of investing in projects that guarantee no returns. They will reason that companies are only responsible to their shareholders for profits and if they keep investing in unprofitable ventures, they will soon go out of business. Unethical choices may look promising in the short run but the eventual cost to the society is large. Take energy sector for instance. The sector is not only exploiting non-renewable resources, but the carbon dioxide emission from the industry poses imminent threat to environment. The industry may look profitable apparently, but the hidden cost to the society is large. According to a 2015 report, the carbon dioxide cost to the society exceeded the profits made by the industry. That means if the government passed legislation making it mandatory for every company to fix the damage to society, not many businesses will stay profitable. Instead of mere compliance, companies should pro-actively embody social goals, and environmental welfare should form the bedrock of social responsibility. Only when every tree has been felted and the last drop of water has been poisoned will people realize they cannot survive on arbitrary profits.

The drugmaker is combining two medicines to overcome lung cancer’s defenses against an immune system attack, an approach that became more attractive after rivals’ studies showed that single-drug therapy might only work in certain patients. Now AstraZeneca is racing Roche Holding AG and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. to be first to the market with a two-drug treatment that helps more newly-diagnosed people. “We made a deliberate choice to go right away to the combination strategy,” Mondher Mahjoubi, general manager of oncology at the AstraZeneca, said in an interview. Once seen as a laggard in immune-oncology, AstraZeneca’s fortunes got a boost in August when Bristol-Myers’s Opdivo failed an ambitious test that tried to show its effectiveness as a first-line treatment for a broad swath of patients with lung cancer. Results of single drug trials such as this one have shown that while a single treatment is effective on tumors with high levels of a biological marker called PD-L1., when levels of the biomarker are lower, a combination approach is necessary, Mahjoubi said. Backbone of Therapy The backbone of AstraZeneca’s approach is durvalumab, which blocks PD-L1, a protein “checkpoint” on some cancer cells that helps them hide from the the body’s immune system. The drugmaker is studying durvalumab in combination with another of its immune oncology drugs, tremelimumab, as a first-line treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer, the most common form of the disease. The company aims to file for approval for the combination in the U.S., Europe and Japan next year. “It is possible, provided that the data supports filing, that we would be first” with an approved first-line combination treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, said Sean Bohen, chief medical officer at AstraZeneca. “There is a huge unmet need, and as a result, a good market opportunity.” Lung cancer killed about 1.59 million people around the world in 2012, according to the World Health Organization, making it the leading cause of cancer deaths. It’s the biggest killer in the U.S., and there will be an estimated 224,000 cases and 158,000 deaths this year, according to the American Cancer Society. Competitors Other checkpoint inhibitors like durvalumab include Bristol-Myers’s Opdivo and Merck & Co.’s Keytruda, and have showed early promise in lung cancer. Cambridge, England-based AstraZeneca has the broadest portfolio of combinations, with 19 combinations of immune oncology medicines in its experimental pipeline, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, though all of the drugmakers are exploring combination treatments in some form or another. Bristol’s approach is similar to AstraZeneca’s: mixing two immune-oncology drugs. A combination of its Opdivo and Yervoy is in late stage trials slated to complete in early 2018. The New York-based company’s emphasis on combinations comes after the drugmaker in August failed to show Opdivo was significantly better than chemotherapy in first-line therapy. At the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Copenhagen on Sunday, Bristol-Myers presented more data from the trial that showed little difference in how first-line lung cancer patients did on the drug, even in those with high PD-L1 levels. That failure could disappoint doctors and investors. The results were “below expectations,” wrote John Scotti, an analyst at Evercore ISI in New York. Roche too is in late-stage trials of its immune oncology drug Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy, and with chemotherapy and the already approved targeted therapy Avastin, as a first-line treatment in patients with lung cancer. It expects to file for regulatory approvals for the combinations in 2018. Merck presented data at the conference on Sunday from an early-stage trial of a combination of its checkpoint inhibitor Keytruda and conventional chemotherapy tested on lung cancer patients. The results showed the combination was more effective than chemotherapy as a first-line treatment, regardless of their levels of the PD-L1 biomarker. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

"Suddenly, this trial news opens quite some opportunities for us, in both monotherapy and combination therapy," Chief Executive Pascal Soriot told Reuters on Saturday, in his first comments since the Opdivo trial flop in August. Soriot is in Copenhagen for the European Society for Medical Oncology congress, where he and his team will be scouring data from competitors to determine how best to fine-tune their own clinical work to maximise its chance of success. The timing has been fortuitous for the British drugmaker, which can now take advantage of the experience of its rivals. At stake is a chunk of a hugely promising new market for cancer treatments that fight tumours by boosting the immune system. Industry analysts forecast such drugs could eventually generate annual sales of $30 billion to $40 billion, with lung cancer seen as the biggest opportunity. Much of the clinical focus is on the best way to select patients likely to benefit from the new and expensive medicines, by using biomarkers to assess their tumours. While the Opdivo trial included patients with low levels of a protein called PD-L1, a separate trial found Merck's similar drug Keytruda worked well in a much smaller group of patients expressing at least 50 percent PD-L1. That gives AstraZeneca the opportunity to steer a path between its two rivals by refining the PD-L1 benchmarks used in its own keenly awaited clinical trial, known as MYSTIC, which is expected to report results early next year. "It gives us a chance to do what BMS was trying to do, but do it in a less risky manner, by expanding the population from the 50 percent PD-L1 cut-off to a bit broader," Soriot said. AstraZeneca's rival to Opdivo and Keytruda is durvalumab, which is being tested on its own and with another immunotherapy called tremelimumab. The British company is currently planning to look at how well its treatment fares among patients with a 25 percent PD-L1 expression level or more, but it has the flexibility to amend this. Roche also has a rival immunotherapy called Tecentriq, which has proved effective in previously treated lung cancer patients, and the fact that AstraZeneca looks like being fourth to market has been viewed negatively by many investors. Soriot argues this ignores the fact his company has the potential to leap ahead in combination therapy, which could well become the main choice for most lung cancer patients. "We're coming from a place where everybody thought we were behind and we have a very good chance to play in both the monotherapy and combination segments," Soriot said. "Even if BMS were to catch up with us in combination, there would still only be two companies with these regimens." Currently, Bristol's competing immunotherapy combination is not expected to produce clinical trial results until 2018. Furthermore, AstraZeneca has another card up its sleeve in the form of a so-called priority review voucher from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which Soriot said could be used, if needed, to help it seek rapid approval. "Being first is definitely important," Soriot said. (Editing by Susan Thomas) Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

While Roche has been profitable for decades, Exelixis is still losing money. On the other hand, Exelixis stock has more than doubled this year, but shares of the Swiss pharma giant have given up about 10% over the same period. EXEL data by YCharts. More From Fool.com Investors are right to wonder if they should dive into volatile Exelixis stock following its recent plunge or seek safety in Roche’s diverse revenue streams. Let’s look at some challenges and opportunities facing both companies to see which stock is the better buy. What’s new Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Exelixis’ lead drug, cabozantinib, chalked up a huge win this April when the FDA approved a tablet form under the brand name Cabometyx for treatment of advanced kidney cancer patients.Although cabozantinib capsules first earned approvalfor treatment of medullary thyroid cancer in 2012 under the brand nameCometriq,it generated modest sales in the limited population. When cabozantinib failed to show a survival benefit in a study with prostate cancer patients a couple of years ago,many analysts assumed its sales would remain limited. They were wrong. Although Cabometyx launched into the larger kidney cancer population partway through the second quarter, Exelixis’ net product revenue exploded from just $9.1 million in the first three months of the year to $31.6 million during the three months ended June. Image source: Roche. Roche also has an exciting new cancer therapy. Tecentriq binds to PD-L1 found on the surface of a variety of tumor cells, limiting their ability to suppress immune-system attacks. Two incredibly successful therapies, Opdivo from Bristol-Myers Squibband Keytruda from Merck & Co., act on the immune-cell side of the same pathway, but Tecentriq became the first of its class to earn an FDA approval in May. What’s next At the moment, Tecentriq is limited to treatment of a relatively limited group of people with bladder cancer, but that could change soon. Any day now, the FDA is expected to announce its decision regarding an application that would expand Tecentriq’s availability from bladder cancer to a much larger group of advanced lung cancer patients. Each year, lung cancers claim the lives of 1.6 million people worldwide, making it the leading cause of cancer death. With eight phase 3 lung cancer studies evaluating Tecentriq in this enormous population showing encouraging results thus far, the therapy has a real chance of reaching peak annual sales estimates north of $3 billion. Image source: Getty Images. Roche has more than Tecentriq label expansions to look forward to. Its candidate Ocrevus is the first multiple sclerosis drug to slow progression of the most aggressive form of the disease in large clinical studies. Roche expects an FDA decision regarding an application to treat this underserved population, which represents about 15% of the world’s 2.3 million people with multiple sclerosis, by the end of the year. If approved as expected, Ocrevus could add more than $5 billion annually to the company’s top line. For Exelixis, Cabometyx sales in the second quarter were strong enough to suggest its current role in kidney cancer has enough fuel to drive the company to profit town, but it could go much further. A patient’s disease must progress following a specific type of therapy before they become eligible for Cabometyx, butPfizer‘s Sutent is approved for newly diagnosed, untreated advanced kidney cancer patients. However,Exelixis announced that treatment with Cabometyx significantly slowed disease progression compared to Sutent in a 150-patient trial.We’ll have a better idea of how far Cabometyx can expand into the advanced kidney cancer population when it presents results from the study on Oct. 10 at a scientific conference. Exelixis is also running a phase 3 trial that could support an application to treat the most common form of liver cancer. It recently passed its first interim analysis,and if the trial is successful, Cabometyx could eventually generate more than $1 billion in annual sales. In the numbers Given Exelixis’ small market cap of around $2.9 billion, a slight breeze could blast its share price in one direction or the other. If Cabometyx shows clear signs it’s headed for the $1 billion mark, the stock could soar. Unfortunately, those signs must appear sooner rather than later, because Exelixis’ main cabozantinib patents are set to expire in 2024. Unlike Roche’s best-selling products, Cabometyx is asmall molecule drug. Once it loses exclusivity, generic competition could quickly hammer its sales. Image source: Getty Images. In stark contrast to Exelixis, Roche needs fire-breathing monster trucks to move the needle. The company finished the first half on pace to generate more than $53 billion in revenue this year.Challenging growth further,biosimilarcompetitionfor two drugs that comprised 24.6% of total sales in the first half (Rituxan and Herceptin)could be on the way. With a rock-solid dividend offering a 2.7% yield at recent prices, and 29 consecutive years of payment raises (in Swiss francs), Roche is a great stock for those in need of steadily growing income. If you’re willing to take risk in hope of greater capital gains, though, Exelixis looks like the better buy. A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world’s biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn’t miss a beat: There’s a small company that’s powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Cory Renauer (TMFang4apples) Oct 8, 2016 at 7:24AM Image source: Getty Images. Recently approved cancer therapies from Exelixis (NASDAQ:EXEL) and Roche (NASDAQOTH:RHHBY) have oncologists fizzing with excitement, but the two drugmakers have more differences than similarities. While Roche has been profitable for decades, Exelixis is still losing money. On the other hand, Exelixis stock has more than doubled this year, but shares of the Swiss pharma giant have given up about 10% over the same period. EXEL data by YCharts. Investors are right to wonder if they should dive into volatile Exelixis stock following its recent plunge or seek safety in Roche's diverse revenue streams. Let's look at some challenges and opportunities facing both companies to see which stock is the better buy. What's new Exelixis' lead drug, cabozantinib, chalked up a huge win this April when the FDA approved a tablet form under the brand name Cabometyx for treatment of advanced kidney cancer patients. Although cabozantinib capsules first earned approval for treatment of medullary thyroid cancer in 2012 under the brand name Cometriq, it generated modest sales in the limited population. When cabozantinib failed to show a survival benefit in a study with prostate cancer patients a couple of years ago, many analysts assumed its sales would remain limited. They were wrong. Although Cabometyx launched into the larger kidney cancer population partway through the second quarter, Exelixis' net product revenue exploded from just $9.1 million in the first three months of the year to $31.6 million during the three months ended June. Image source: Roche. Roche also has an exciting new cancer therapy. Tecentriq binds to PD-L1 found on the surface of a variety of tumor cells, limiting their ability to suppress immune-system attacks. Two incredibly successful therapies, Opdivo from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Keytruda from Merck & Co., act on the immune-cell side of the same pathway, but Tecentriq became the first of its class to earn an FDA approval in May.  What's next At the moment, Tecentriq is limited to treatment of a relatively limited group of people with bladder cancer, but that could change soon. Any day now, the FDA is expected to announce its decision regarding an application that would expand Tecentriq's availability from bladder cancer to a much larger group of advanced lung cancer patients. Each year, lung cancers claim the lives of 1.6 million people worldwide, making it the leading cause of cancer death. With eight phase 3 lung cancer studies evaluating Tecentriq in this enormous population showing encouraging results thus far, the therapy has a real chance of reaching peak annual sales estimates north of $3 billion.  Image source: Getty Images. Roche has more than Tecentriq label expansions to look forward to. Its candidate Ocrevus is the first multiple sclerosis drug to slow progression of the most aggressive form of the disease in large clinical studies. Roche expects an FDA decision regarding an application to treat this underserved population, which represents about 15% of the world's 2.3 million people with multiple sclerosis, by the end of the year. If approved as expected, Ocrevus could add more than $5 billion annually to the company's top line. For Exelixis, Cabometyx sales in the second quarter were strong enough to suggest its current role in kidney cancer has enough fuel to drive the company to profit town, but it could go much further. A patient's disease must progress following a specific type of therapy before they become eligible for Cabometyx, but Pfizer's Sutent is approved for newly diagnosed, untreated advanced kidney cancer patients. However, Exelixis announced that treatment with Cabometyx significantly slowed disease progression compared to Sutent in a 150-patient trial. We'll have a better idea of how far Cabometyx can expand into the advanced kidney cancer population when it presents results from the study on Oct. 10 at a scientific conference. Exelixis is also running a phase 3 trial that could support an application to treat the most common form of liver cancer. It recently passed its first interim analysis, and if the trial is successful, Cabometyx could eventually generate more than $1 billion in annual sales. In the numbers Given Exelixis' small market cap of around $2.9 billion, a slight breeze could blast its share price in one direction or the other. If Cabometyx shows clear signs it's headed for the $1 billion mark, the stock could soar. Unfortunately, those signs must appear sooner rather than later, because Exelixis' main cabozantinib patents are set to expire in 2024.

Among the several varieties of drugs and surgeries available in the market, the demand for drugs such as Prostaglandins which includes Trabatan, Lumbigan are the highest due to its high efficiency in treating glaucoma. Vesneo has shown a superior intraocular pressure reduction effect on beta-blocker timolol, the most widely used comparator in registration trials for glaucoma, in two phase 3 studies. Globally, the major factors contributing to the growth of Glaucoma treatment market is the higher number of glaucoma patients from the U.S, Europe and Japan. Novel therapies for glaucoma are constantly being investigated by research and development teams of various pharmaceutical companies, at different stages. It can be predicted that novel therapies that work in conjunction with current drugs, such as Prostaglandins, will likely be increasingly common in the near future. Growth of the Glaucoma treatment market could also be attributed to North America where the number of patients suffering from glaucoma is the highest among the rest of the U.S and also from emerging markets such as France and Singapore driven by rapid increase of old age population. Moreover, the Asian market is expected to become a huge potential market for glaucoma surgery devices in the foreseeable future, as it is expected to grow at comparatively the fastest among all other regions. It is estimated that by 2020, 11 million individuals will have vision loss due to glaucoma. Glaucoma market is seen as a diversifying risk to other lines of ophthalmic treatment business and is attracting more and more revenue. Glaucoma treatment companies are launching new technologies and adopting new strategies in the industry and making significant investments.

Who We Are About the Magazine Irish America Team Our Contributors In This Issue Archives Hall of Fame The Lists Business 100 Wall Street 50 Health and Life Sciences 50 Top 50 Power Women Top 100 Stars of the South Blog Events Travel Gift Shop Irish America Celebrates Annual Healthcare & Life Sciences 50 Dr. Barbara Murphy, chief of Medicine at Mount Sinai Health System, delivers the 3rd annual Healthcare and Life Sciences 50 keynote address in Manhattan. (All photos by Nuala Purcell) By Irish America Staff, October 6, 2015 Irish America celebrated its annual Healthcare and Life Sciences 50 Awards Reception, co-hosted with ICON plc, on October 5 in Manhattan. The Healthcare and Life Sciences 50 aims to recognize the best and brightest professionals in the medical industry and highlight the work they are doing to improve the lives of their communities and our healthcare industry. “There’s a lot of change – connected health, personalized medicine, patients being helped through advances in technology and connectivity,” Ciaran Murray, CEO of ICON, said. “And I think that when we look at quality of the people here in this room, the quality of people working in Ireland and the U.S., I think it would be safe to say that we can be optimistic and say that Irish Americans, and Ireland, and America, will continue to be at the forefront of driving that change and movement.” Irish America co-founder and editor-in-chief Patricia Harty spoke towards that theme as well, recognizing the achievements of the honorees and invoking their selfless service to the medical profession. She specifically paid tribute to Nobel laureate Dr. William Campbell (August / September cover story), who was born in Donegal and spent his career working for Merck, where he discovered a cure for river blindness. When he was told of his Nobel Prize, Harty noted, “He said, ‘Well, how can you honor me? It was the team.’ He wanted to make absolutely certain that it was his team, his colleagues, and that he accepted the award on behalf of him.” Honorees Dr. James Watson, Brian Dougherty, Dr. Owen O’Connor, Dr. John Neylan III, Dr. Michael Mullen, and Keynote Speaker Dr. Barbara Murphy and her husband, Peter Fogarty. (Photo Nuala Purcell) Among the honorees in attendance was also Nobel laureate Dr. James Watson, one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962. Looking at the crowd, Watson, who is 53 percent Irish and whose ancestors come from Nenagh, Co. Tipperary, joked that he is worried “the world doesn’t know yet how prominent the Irish are yet.” Dr. Barbara Murphy delivered the keynote remarks during the reception. Born in Ireland, Dr. Murphy is Dr. Barbara Murphy is the Chair of the Samuel Bronfman Department of Medicine, the Murray M. Rosenberg Professor of Medicine, and the Dean of Clinical Integration and Population Management at the Icahn School of Medicine at the Mount Sinai Health System. In these roles, she is the only female chair of medicine in New York, and one of only three women to be appointed chair of medicine at a top medical school in the country. Dr. Murphy spoke of motivating factors for her professional trajectory and the benefit of both her cultural upbringing and the fact that she had the fortune to attend medical school in both Ireland and the U.S. Dr. Barbara Murphy, chief of Medicine at Mount Sinai Health System, delivers the 3rd annual Healthcare and Life Sciences 50 keynote address in Manhattan. (Photo: Nuala Purcell) “It is at times like these that I remember with amusement my old elementary school teacher, who told my mother I was a dunce and would never be anything. What’s more, she said, my mother shouldn’t even try,” she said. “I was four. Fortunately, my parents persevered.” And yet, she pointed out that, “We Irish are known for our determination, strength of character, persistence – or, less politely put, stubbornness – but all of these characteristics have helped us in times of adversity. They are certainly characteristics that contributed to the resilience of many of your forebears in their journey to this new land. But, we are also known for our humor, not taking ourselves too seriously, and the importance, as the nuns put it, of not having ‘notions about yourself.’ “As a physician, I am incredibly proud of my heritage and how it has shaped my perspective on life. I am very grateful for the outstanding education that I received in Ireland and the values that were instilled in me by my teachers: they taught me the importance of connecting with and having empathy for patients. Scholarship did not matter if you were not kind. If a patient with arthritis winced when we shook their hand, it did not matter what we knew about the disease or the treatment. We had failed, because we hadn’t taken the patient’s overall well being into consideration,” she said. “When I came to the U.S., my Irish education was profoundly supplemented by a rigorous academic experience, and I am the fortunate product of both systems. Without a doubt, it made me a better doctor.” Dr. Murphy also spoke towards the importance of the physician-patient relationship. For her, the ability of the Irish to sympathize and create strong interpersonal bonds is one of the greatest opportunities for those practicing medicine. Moreover, she said, it’s one that the honorees can and should impart to others. “But we Irish, as leaders in the field who come from a tradition of loving the story and the chat and connecting with people, need to ensure that as we drive these advances we remember the importance of the personal interaction between the patient and the physician. We can be listeners, but also be the innovators to develop tools and systems to help manage the data and facilitate that interaction,” she said. “You cannot underestimate the importance of a patient’s trust in their doctor to help calm their fears and contribute to their overall wellbeing.” Following Dr. Murphy’s address, Harty and O’Dowd presented her with the House of Waterford Crystal Lismore Essence Vase Keynote Speaker Award.

Murphy and Watson, currently serves as chancellor emeritus at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where he established the Human Genome Project, the 2016 honorees recognized at the event included: Dr. Michael Mullen, the institute director for advanced medicine and a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.

Resend activation e-mail Scientific Method / Science & Exploration For ripping off Medicaid, EpiPen maker Mylan pays Feds $465 million In settlement, Mylan doesn’t admit guilt for misclassifying life-saving device. by Beth Mole - Oct 8, 2016 12:47 am UTC Login to bookmark 142 Heather Bresch, chief executive officer of Mylan. Getty | Bloomberg In a settlement announced Friday, Mylan, Inc., the maker of EpiPens, will shell out $465 million to the US Department of Justice and other federal agencies to brush aside any questions about its Medicaid rebates. As Ars reported last week, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced that, by misclassifying EpiPens for years, Mylan has been stiffing federal and state governments out of millions of dollars’ worth of rebates. The CMS said that it had notified Mylan of the mistake “on multiple occasions” since 2007, when the company bought the EpiPen from Merck. In the meantime, Mylan hiked the price of the life-saving devices on 15 separate occasions, reaching an increase of more than 500 percent. An EpiPen two-pack now goes for more than $600, while a nearly identical single pen was around just $50 in 2007. The steep rise in price has drawn outrage and scorn from the public and lawmakers. With the $465 million settlement, Mylan hopes to improve its public image. However, as part of the agreement, the company said it would not fess up to any wrongdoing. In a statement, Mylan CEO Heather Bresch said: This agreement is another important step in Mylan's efforts to move forward and bring resolution to all EpiPen Auto-Injector related matters. The agreement is in addition to the significant steps Mylan has taken in relation to EpiPen Auto-Injector over the past several weeks, including the unprecedented, pending launch of a generic version of EpiPen Auto-Injector and expansion of our patient access programs for this product. Entering into this settlement is the right course of action at this time for the Company, its stakeholders and the Medicaid program. The disagreement between the CMS and Mylan centers around how to classify EpiPens under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, which requires drug makers to offer the government rebates if their drugs are covered by Medicaid and Medicare. According to the CMS, EpiPen, which currently has no generic version and is under patent protection, is clearly a brand name, single-source drug. As such, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires Mylan pay a rebate of 23.1 percent to the government. Also, Mylan would be required to cough up extra rebates any time it raised the price of its brand name drug at a rate higher than inflation, which it did—15 times. But, Mylan reported to the CMS that the EpiPen is a generic. As such, the company has only been paying 13 percent rebates and not shelling out anything after price hikes. Although the government has not released an estimated total of how much Mylan underpaid, the Minnesota Department of Health estimates that Mylan cost that state alone $4.3 million just in 2015. Under the terms of the settlement with the DOJ, Mylan will be clear of any liability claims by the federal and state governments related to EpiPens classification and rebates.

The Improper Solicitation and Graft Act that went into effect on Sept. 28 limits public officials, journalists and private school teachers to giving or receiving a meal more than 30,000 won ($26.95), a gift of more than 50,000 won and a congratulatory or condolence payment of more than 100,000 won. Any type of illicit solicitation is prohibited as well. Industry sources say foreign companies have been preparing heavily for the law, drafting manuals and revising their internal codes of conduct way ahead of the enactment. “Foreign firms sought legal advice well before the Constitutional Court upheld the new law as constitutional in July,” said Lee Kwang-wook, a lawyer and partner at local law firm Yoon & Yang. These firms, according to the attorney, were in a hurry to prepare because their Korean offices are as vulnerable to the new law as their domestic counterparts. “It’s true foreign firms are under strict compliance rules from their home countries, but when it comes to their operations in South Korea, such as sales and PR activities, as well as working with government officials, they are not too different from local companies because they are basically working in a Korean business environment,” he said. According to industry insiders, the automobile, pharmaceutical and financial industries seemed likely to be most affected by the new law.  (123rf) No more lavish marketing campaigns To avoid trouble, foreign automakers are cutting down on marketing campaigns. In the past, a new car launching event was usually held at five-star hotels in Seoul, complete with media and high-profile industry figures. Sumptuous meals and expensive thank-you gifts were part of the perks. But under the new law, lavish press conferences are no longer an option. A press conference held on Sept. 29 -- a day after the anti-graft law went into effect -- by British luxury carmaker Rolls-Royce was one example of how such events might be handled in the future. Neither lunch nor gifts were offered, though the company did offer a bus ride to the venue, along with some finger food and soft drinks. Then there’s the issue of test-driving. In the past, automakers allowed reporters to drive their new cars for a few days when writing reviews. These cars were provided with a full gas tank that did not need refilling. The value of this provision, however, easily exceeds the limit stipulated in the anti-graft law. But as test-drives are a big part of marketing, carmakers are contemplating how to work around it. Mercedes-Benz, which is planning on releasing a new model later this year, said it will hold test-driving events that comply with the new law. Crackdown on pharma sector corruption The anti-graft law is also expected to deal a major blow to the pharmaceutical industry, which is notorious for rampant kickbacks offered to doctors. Just last month, former and current officials of the Korean unit of Swiss-based Novartis were indicted for paying billions of won as rebates to doctors for prescribing its products. Doctors and workers at major hospitals are now subject to the new law as they are classified as government officials if they work at a public hospital, and as faculty members if they work for university hospitals. Law violators can face up to 30 million won in fines or imprisonment of a maximum of three years. Foreign pharma firms, such as MSD Korea -- the local affiliate of US-based Merck & Co. -- and the Korean unit of UK-based GlaxoSmithKline, are educating employees to avoid any fallout. “We are communicating with the employees, along with our legal team, to help them avoid any breach of law,” a spokesperson of MSD Korea said. But the situation is not easy, pharma firms said, because some doctors are refusing to meet with their sales representatives altogether. Major university hospitals, such as Seoul National University Hospital and Korea University Hospital, have posted notices throughout their buildings warning staff about the new law. Confusion in financial sector In finance and banking sectors, firms are on a high alert due to the ambiguous clauses in the anti-graft law. “When the government entrusts funds or delegates authorities to financial institutions, both local and foreign, they become fiduciaries and are subject to the law,” said Yang Ho-seung, managing partner at Yoon & Yang law firm. But the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission -- the state entity in charge of the law -- hasn’t made an authoritative interpretation on the status of bank employees when they perform government services or deal with bureaucrats. The Korea Federation of Banks -- the association of local and foreign banks in Korea -- is waiting for the commission’s response on the issue. In the meantime, the association has asked the banks to limit their activities so that all costs stay under the figures stipulated in the new law. Foreign securities firms that also work closely with government organizations and media outlets have become extremely prudent. “Golf outings with investors and journalists have all been canceled,” according to a senior official at a foreign security firm, who declined to be named. “Brokerage firms and financial institutions acquire government approval for new financial products,” said Lee of Yoon & Yang. “But now these processes may be delayed since bankers are reluctant to contact government officials.”  By Ahn Sung-mi (sahn@heraldcorp.com) 영어뉴스를 통한 ListeningㆍReading 실력 향상 단기 학습 프로그램 [NEST] 1.

Vancouver-based Biotech company DelMar Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: DMPI) is making significant strides in fighting this rare disease. With maximum treatment, glioblastoma remains a devastating disease, with the most common length of survival following diagnosis being 12–15 months, with less than 3–5 percent of people surviving longer than five years. DelMar Pharmaceuticals is taking aggressive steps to combat this disease and create a more favorable outcome with those burdened with a glioblastoma diagnosis. Its product, VAL-083, is under clinical trials and isn't just some moonshot therapy. It possesses a unique anti-cancer mechanism to overcome chemotherapy resistance, a major reason why most glioblastoma patients don't make it. The company will transition to a late state clinical development this year. Related Link: Here's Why Seattle Genetics' Adcetris Is A $2 Billion Product Essentially, VAL-083 attacks the tumor's DNA at a different point compared to current therapy. Another key differentiator with VAL-083 is that it crosses the blood brain barrier, something that most chemotherapies are currently incapable of. This further strengthens its ability to treat brain tumors, which has been the company's primary area of clinical focus to date. "Median survival in the past had been 8 months for glioblastoma, just by adding our drug in addition to radiotherapy, lived 17 months, changing the game. There is clear evidence that we are going to do something in this population," said DelMar Pharmaceutical CEO Jeffrey Bacha in an exclusive Benzinga interview. "We really believe this drug can have an impact for patients in some very important and very large big cancer, while that is exciting from an investor point of view, but also from a patient point of view where patients have very little options, it is life changing," added Bacha. The market potential could be quite large. For example, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK)'s brain cancer drug Temodar generated $989 million in revenue in 2013 before it came off patent. Glioblastoma is a billion-dollar market. "Even though we are starting out in a focused niche, it really does have true blockbuster potential," Bacha said. DelMar Pharmaceutical's new clinical studies are making headway for some patients and families desperate to find a cure for this devastating disease. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.
