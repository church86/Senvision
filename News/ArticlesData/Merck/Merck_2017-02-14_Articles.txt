Merck's verubecestat becomes the latest casualty in treating Alzheimer's disease. Is there any hope in sight for this dreaded disease? Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Feb 15, 2017 at 5:02PM And another one bites the dust. Merck (NYSE:MRK) announced on Tuesday that it was halting a phase 2/3 clinical study of verubecestat in treating Alzheimer's disease. This news marked the second major clinical failure in recent months by a big drugmaker for a disease that still has no effective treatment. Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) reported disappointing results for solanezumab in treating Alzheimer's disease in November. Why are these drugs proving to be ineffective? And is a pipeline candidate with a real shot at beating Alzheimer's disease anywhere in sight?  Image source: Getty Images. What's not working Merck's verubecestat inhibits the beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). BACE1 is an enzyme that's involved with the development of amyloid beta. Amyloid beta consists of pieces of protein that clump together and build up over time into amyloid plaque in the brain. The goal of BACE inhibitors is to prevent the buildup of this plaque, and thereby slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Verubecestat showed great promise in an early-stage study. Patients with Alzheimer's disease taking a 60 mg dose of the experimental drug experienced sustained reduction in the levels of beta-amyloid peptides. Lilly's solanezumab also targeted the buildup of amyloid beta, but through a different mechanism. The humanized monoclonal antibody binds with soluble forms for the peptide that are thought to interfere with cognitive function. But while verubecestat reduced amyloid beta, Merck's external data-monitoring committee stated that the experimental drug had "virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect" in improving cognition. Lilly's drug had already failed to improve cognition in two previous late-stage studies. However, the drugmaker initially saw some potential for solanezumab in reducing cognitive decline in patients with a mild form of Alzheimer's disease. Lilly moved forward with another late-stage study, which also flopped. More attempts Although Lilly has thrown in the towel for solanezumab, Merck is continuing to evaluate verubecestat in a late-stage study for treating Alzheimer's patients with early symptoms of the disease. Lilly and AstraZeneca are partnering on their own BACE inhibitor, which is currently in a late-stage trial. Roche (NASDAQOTH:RHHBY) has also run into dead ends in the past in treating Alzheimer's disease. Gantenerumab disappointed in a previous phase 3 study targeting the indication. However, Roche thought the experimental drug might have a better chance of success given in higher doses. The company has two late-stage studies currently in progress, one for gantenerumab plus another for crenezumab. Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) claims one of the most promising Alzheimer's disease candidates right now. The biotech announced encouraging results from an early stage study of aducanumab in 2016. These results showed reduction in amyloid plaque, and more importantly, the rate of clinical decline in patients. Aducanumab is now in a late-stage study. Other theories Note that all of the drugs mentioned thus far target reduction of amyloid beta. There are other thoughts, however, about how to treat Alzheimer's disease. A major alternative theory involves preventing buildup of tau proteins. Like amyloid beta, tau protein deposits have been found in the brain cells of Alzheimer's disease patients. A couple of companies are pursuing the tau theory. Slovakian biotech AXON Neuroscience has a phase 2 study of its AADvac1 tau vaccine in progress. AC Immune is working with Johnson & Johnson on tau vaccine ACI-35 and with Roche on an anti-tau antibody. Both experimental therapies are in early-stage testing. Axovant Sciences (NYSE:AXON) is taking yet another approach. Alzheimer's disease patients have low levels of a neurotransmitter chemical called acetylcholine. Axovant's intepirdine is a 5HT6 receptor antagonist that blocks the receptor's ability to decrease acetylcholine levels. The experimental drug is in a late-stage clinical study for treating patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. What's next With the Alzheimer's-disease landscape littered with failures, it's probably wise to focus more on candidates farther along in the pipeline -- even though several late-stage drugs have also flopped. Merck's continuing late-stage study of verubecestat isn't scheduled to wrap up until 2019. Biogen should report results for aducanumab in 2019, also. Roche is on track to announce results from its study of gantenerumab in the same year. Results from the late-stage study of Roche's crenezumab are expected in 2020. It's possible, of course, that these studies could be halted early if there's no chance of success -- just as Merck recently did.  The earliest hope for an effective Alzheimer's treatment is with Axovant's intepirdine. Results from the company's late-stage study should be announced in the third quarter of this year. Keith Speights has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The decision was made to end trials on verubecestat for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease after an external study found there was "virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect," said a statement issued late Tuesday. "While we are disappointed that a benefit was not observed in this study, our work continues," said Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories, adding that verubecestat will continue to be studied "in people with less advanced disease." Another study using the experimental drug is continuing, with its results expected in 2019. The results of a preliminary trial involving the drug in 32 people were released in November, when the company described the results as encouraging. The experimental drug was said to work by reducing levels of beta amyloid proteins by blocking an enzyme known as BACE1. In people with Alzheimer's disease, the proteins clump into plaques that damage the brain, affecting cognitive abilities, especially memory. The enzyme plays a key role in producing the proteins. Three months ago, US firm Eli Lilly abandoned its experimental drug solanezumab, saying it failed in a major clinical trial and calling the results "disappointing." The World Health Organization says 36 million people worldwide suffer from dementia. The number of cases is expected to reach more than 65 million by 2030, and triple to 115 million by 2050.

Drug company Merck made the decision after an independent study found that the drug, verubecestat, had 'virtually no chance' of working. The news comes just three months after Eli Lilly ended the only other promising trial into a drug to treat the devastating brain disease. Patients taking it had demonstrated no signs of improvement compared to those taking a placebo. It marks the latest in a long line of crushing disappointments as scientists struggle to find an effective treatment for the mind-wasting disease. Drug company Merck announced it was halting its late-stage trial for a new Alzheimer's drug after an independent study found it had 'virtually no chance of working' (stock) Merck had been testing the drug in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. 'There were high hopes that [the trial] might succeed,' Dr John Breitner, a professor of geriatric psychiatry and preventive medicine at McGill University, told CNN. 'There is a lot of concern and debate in the professional community at this point. It has been very disappointing.'  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Heading a football raises the risk of dementia: Study of... Do YOU cook with vegetable oil? It could increase your risk... Share this article Share HOW TO DETECT ALZHEIMER'S Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory, thinking skills and the ability to perform simple tasks. It is the cause of 60 percent to 70 percent of cases of dementia. The majority of people with Alzheimer's are age 65 and older. More than five million Americans have Alzheimer’s. It is unknown what causes Alzheimer's. Those who have the APOE gene are more likely to develop late-onset Alzheimer's.  Signs and symptoms: Difficulty remembering newly learned information Disorientation Mood and behavioral changes Suspicion about family, friends and professional caregivers More serious memory loss Difficulty with speaking, swallowing and walking Stage of Alzheimer's: Mild Alzheimer's (early-stage) - A person may be able to function independently but is having memory lapses Moderate Alzheimer's (middle-stage) - Typically the longest stage, the person may confuse words, get frustrated or angry, or have sudden behavioral changes Severe Alzheimer's disease (late-stage) - In the final stage, individuals lose the ability to respond to their environment, carry on a conversation and, eventually, control movement There is no known cure for Alzheimer's, but experts suggest physical exercise, social interaction and adding brain boosting omega-3 fats to your diet to prevent or slowdown the onset of symptoms. Currently, about 47 million people live with dementia worldwide, with Alzheimer's accounting for 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases. This figure is expected to double every 20 years to reach 131 million people in 2050, according to Alzheimer's Disease International. The disease slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, and eventually the ability to carry out the simplest tasks. It's been over a a decade since a new drug for alleviating the symptoms of Alzheimer's was made available.  However, there is currently no treatment available proven to stop - or slow down - the impact of the disease. Verubecestat belongs to a class of experimental Alzheimer's drugs called BACE1 inhibitors that target an enzyme involved in the formation of the toxic amyloid protein that turns into plaque in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. While the ultimate cause of cell death and tissue loss in the brain of Alzheimer's patients has never been proven, amyloid plaque build-up between nerve cells in the brain has been long suspected as one of the main causes. But the failure of verubecestat adds to growing concerns that this assumption is wrong. Although studies have managed to successfully 'cure' or reduce memory loss in transgenic lab animals such as rats, this has never been replicated in humans. Dr Breitner said: 'Alzheimer's is a terrible disease and we desperately need treatments. There would be a huge market for a successful drug. 'Until now companies have been willing to take the risk [by investing large sums of money in clinical trials]. But at the moment a lot of things are being reassessed.' Researchers are increasingly focusing on attacking the disease earlier because it appears likely that once symptoms have taken hold, any approach fails to work. Merck said another study of its drug in patients with prodromal, or very early, Alzheimer's disease would continue with results expected by February 2019. Patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease have objective memory problems but relatively normal functioning in activities of daily living.  Read more: Promising Alzheimer's drug verubecestat fails in Merck trial - CNN.com Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched News videos Moment ISIS suicide attacker detonates bomb near Syrian rebels Dog CRIES after being told off for chewing sofa into pieces Redback spider catches brown snake in it's web and attacks it Terrifying moment deadly Chicago ambush captured on Facebook live Shocking moment a model poses on the ledge of very tall skyscraper Social Experiment: Would you breastfeed a stranger's baby?

 A breakthrough approach to treating Alzheimer's is facing major setbacks Lydia Ramsey Feb. 15, 2017, 2:07 PM 1,867 facebook linkedin twitter email print NIH Many promising Alzheimer's drug trials have failed in the past few months. The latest trial from drugmaker Merck stopped Tuesday after a committee found that the drug had "virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect." These drugs are based on the "amyloid hypothesis," which some are still hopeful will be a successful way to treat Alzheimer's even with these setbacks. It's been a hard few months for promising Alzheimer's clinical trials.  The disease in its mildest form is characterized by symptoms including memory lapses, getting lost, repeating questions, and misplacing things — behaviors that generally get more severe over time.  By 2050, the number of people living with Alzheimer's in the US alone is projected to triple to an estimated 13.8 million.  Right now, there are only four treatments that treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's, and the hits just keep coming for potential new treatments in development. (On average about 99% of all drugs in clinical trials never actually make it to approval.) On Tuesday, drugmaker Merck stopped its late-stage trial of its drug, verubecestat, in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's, after a committee found that there was "virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect." The hope was to have the drug stop the disease from progressing. Merck said it's still working on another late-stage trial for the drug to treat people with even earlier stages of the disease, and those results are expected in 2019.  The results came less than a week after another Alzheimer's drug that was hoping to treat the symptoms of the disease failed two key clinical trials.  The amyloid hypothesis is taking a beating So far, 2017 isn't looking much different from 2016, when there were four major flops for Alzheimer's drugs, including a highly-anticipated treatment from pharmaceutical giant Lilly. That drug, solanezumab, as well as Merck's verubecestat came out of research on the "amyloid hypothesis," or the idea that targeting beta amyloid deposits in the brain to clear them out was the way to go about treating the disease. In people who have Alzheimer these deposits build up in certain parts of the brain, but it's still not known whether the plaques cause the disease, or are just a byproduct. NIH But solanezumab failed to slow down cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's; those in tests who took a placebo fared about the same.  "It's not what we wanted, it's not that leap forward for patients, but it's a step forward for the science," Dan Skovronsky, Lilly's senior vice president of clinical and product development, told Business Insider in January. Skovronsky said that progress was related to being able to screen patients for the very thing they were trying to target, something that he said seems intuitive but isn't. "What it's telling us is that there's a small effect on disease progression. But it's not zero. It's a clue that we're headed in the right direction." Skovoronsky said that despite some setbacks, he remained more encouraged than ever by the amyloid hypothesis. Even so, Lilly has stopped its remaining phase 3 solanezumab trial, turning the focus onto the company's BACE inhibitor — the same kind of approach that the Merck drug took.  Lilly's not the only one that's holding on hope for the amyloid hypothesis. Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal noted that Merck's trial was expected to fail, in particular because it didn't screen for people with beta-amyloid plaques before getting started (diagnostics that screen for the plaques are still relatively new). That's not the case with the other trial Merck's continuing, where they're targeting people with even earlier stages of Alzheimer's. And treating as early as possible could be the key to proving out the amyloid hypothesis, Roger Pelmutter, Merck's head of research and development told Forbes.  "Because Alzheimer’s progresses over a period of decades, it’s understandable that it might be necessary to get in really quite early," he said.  There will be more opportunities to see that hypothesis in action, too. Biogen, another company that's big in neuroscience, expects to have data on its beta-amyloid targeting treatment in 2019.  There's still more ahead in 2017, and not all rely on the amyloid hypothesis   While a lot seems to hinge on the amyloid hypothesis, drugmakers are working on other approaches that could be game-changing. Accera, the company looking into the metabolic aspects of Alzheimer's, will have data coming out on its phase three trial in the first quarter of 2017. And Axovant, whose drug aims to treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's, will have phase three data coming out in the second half of 2017. Some of Axovant's competitors that have been going after the same target have had less-than stellar results. On February 8, drugmaker Lundbeck announced its 5-HT6 antagonist had failed two key trials, quashing any last hopes for that particular drug.   SEE ALSO: 6 factors that could increase your risk of Alzheimer's disease DON'T MISS: 2017 will be a make-or-break year for neuroscience drugs NOW WATCH: The US government just sank a giant ship on purpose — and the footage is amazing Loading video...

Merck is stopping the study following the recommendation of the external Data Monitoring Committee (eDMC), which assessed overall benefit/risk during a recent interim safety analysis, and determined that there was “virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect.” The eDMC noted that safety signals observed in the study “are not sufficient to warrant stopping study 017,” and recommended that protocol 019, also known as APECS, which is evaluating verubecestat in people with prodromal Alzheimer’s disease, continue unchanged. Results from protocol 019 are expected in February 2019. Results from EPOCH will be analyzed and presented at an upcoming scientific meeting. “Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most pressing and daunting medical issues of our time, with inherent, substantial challenges to developing an effective disease-modifying therapy for people with mild-to-moderate disease. Studies such as EPOCH are critical, and we are indebted to the patients in this study and their caregivers,” said Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “While we are disappointed that a benefit was not observed in this study, our work continues with APECS, which is studying verubecestat in people with less advanced disease.” The efficacy and safety of verubecestat was being evaluated in two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials: Protocol 017, or EPOCH, in mild-to-moderate AD, and Protocol 019, or APECS, in prodromal AD. Patients with mild to moderate AD exhibit detectable and worsening impairment of cognitive and functional abilities. Patients with prodromal AD have objective memory problems but relatively normal functioning in activities of daily living.

Meet the Contributors → Merck Alzheimer Drug Is Latest To Fail In A Big Study Alex Lash February 15th, 2017 @alexlash @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  Another Alzheimer’s drug has failed a major test. Merck (NYSE: MRK) reported late Tuesday that its pill verubecestat was not helping people with significant Alzheimer’s symptoms. The drug maker announced that it halted its EPOCH study early because an oversight group said there was “virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect.” Verubecestat is the latest in a long string of experimental Alzheimer’s drugs that have failed to meet study goals and help people whose symptoms are fairly advanced—known as “mild to moderate” Alzheimer’s. Most of these drugs have attacked the underlying disease by breaking up accumulations, or plaques, of the protein amyloid-beta, or by preventing the plaques from forming. Verubecestat was meant to be a preventative measure. Every failure of an amyloid-targeting drug adds fuel to skepticism about the prevailing theory of treatment: that attacking the protein, in whichever form it takes, will help Alzheimer’s patients. “Expectations for this trial were low,” wrote ISI Evercore biopharma analyst Mark Schoenebaum in a research note Tuesday evening. He cited two factors: First, Merck did not test patients for amyloid-beta before enrolling them. That means people with other forms of dementia were likely included in the 2,200-person study, and verubecestat was not designed to help them. Second, the study aimed to treat people well into the course of the disease. Stung by other failures in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s patients, drug makers and researchers have shifted hopes to patients who have amyloid in their brains, or high risk of Alzheimer’s based on their genetics, but whose symptoms are not as far along. Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) is making a huge bet that its drug aducanumab, now in Phase 3 studies due to provide data in 2019, will help people with early disease. But Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) said last fall that its drug solanezumab failed to deliver enough impact for patients with mild Alzheimer’s, and two months later it pulled the plug on a related study with even earlier-stage patients. Merck said it would continue to test verubecestat in a separate study of prodromal Alzheimer’s patients, who have memory loss but can still live relatively normal lives. The prodromal study is dubbed APECS. Because Alzheimer’s progresses so slowly, researchers are keen to find an underlying biological signal that could stand in for health improvements to show a drug is working. In heart disease, that surrogate signal is lower cholesterol; in HIV, it is viral load. But so far the ties between amyloid levels and changes in health have proven elusive. “A third of people with amyloid in their brains don’t get Alzheimer’s,” said USAgainstAlzheimer’s chairman George Vradenburg in an interview with Xconomy last week. “You can demonstrate a positive change in amyloid, but it’s not necessarily established that you’d have a positive clinical benefit.” More major Alzheimer’s data are due later this year from Axovant Sciences (NASDAQ: AXON), which bought a discontinued drug from GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) for $5 million with hopes it could help mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s patients stave off cognitive decline. The drug, intepirdine, is being tested in a big Phase 3 study in combination with donepezil, one of the few cognitive boosters approved for Alzheimer’s. It works by interacting with the brain chemical serotonin, not by disrupting amyloid. (Axovant’s trial and Merck’s EPOCH were two of 14 key trials to watch in 2017 that Xconomy flagged late last year.) Verubecestat blocks a protein called beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1, or BACE1. When left unchecked, BACE acts like tiny scissors to create the amyloid-beta fragments that clump up into plaques. Earlier BACE inhibitors failed because of safety concerns. Verubecestat is part of a new generation that their makers hope have fewer side effects and change the course of the disease. The outside advisors monitoring EPOCH said that side effects were not part of the decision to stop the study, according to Merck, and recommended that APECS continue without changes. “Brain” by Dierk Schaefer via Creative Commons 2.0 license.

The latest disappointment comes from a phase II/III study of Merck & Co's BACE inhibitor verubecestat, a drug designed to block the formation of the amyloid plaques that are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. The EPOCH trial enrolled patients with established mild-to-moderate Alzheimer symptoms and was due to generate primary results later this year and complete fully in 2019. However, an interim look at the data accrued so far by the study's monitoring committee has determined that there was "virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect" with verubecestat. Merck (known as MSD outside the US and Canada) is currently leading the race to bring a BACE inhibitor to market, so the failure of the EPOCH trial fires a warning shot across the bows of companies that also have BACE inhibitors in development, including Lilly/AstraZeneca, Eisai/Biogen and Novartis. The list of failed amyloid-targeting drugs in Alzheimer's is extensive, but there have been high hopes that BACE inhibitors could duck the trend as they prevent the formation of plaques while other drugs have focused on breaking them up. Several candidates in the class have been discontinued - including Roche's RG7129, Eli Lilly's LY2886721 and Vitae/Boehringer Ingelheim's BI 1181181 - but have so far been scuppered by toxicity issues. The EPOCH trial results are among the first to point to a lack of efficacy for the class, and analysts at Evercore ISI said in a research note that while BACE inhibitors may still have a role to play in Alzheimer's the finding "will dampen investor enthusiasm for the mechanism”. However, the US drugmaker is not giving up on verubecestat just yet. The data monitoring committee has recommended that a trial in prodromal disease - in other words patients who have mild cognitive symptoms but are not yet considered to have Alzheimer's proper - should continue unchanged. That study - called APECS - got underway in 2013 and is due to generate its first results in 2019, said Merck. The company's head of R&D Roger Perlmutter said that while the results are disappointing there are "inherent, substantial challenges" to developing an effective disease-modifying therapy for people with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. "Studies such as EPOCH are critical, and we are indebted to the patients in this study and their caregivers. Our work continues with APECS, which is studying verubecestat in people with less advanced disease," he added. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments.

It comes just three months after Eli Lilly announced that it was ending the clinical trial of its Alzheimer's drug solanezumab, after patients taking it demonstrated no signs of improvement compared to those taking a placebo. "While we are disappointed that a benefit was not observed in this study, our work continues [to study the impact of] verubecestat in people with less advanced disease," said Dr Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories. Experts say the failure of the drug on people with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's was a substantial setback. "There were high hopes that [the trial] might succeed," Professor John Breitner, Canada research chair in prevention of dementia and professor of geriatric psychiatry and preventive medicine at McGill University told CNN.

While two well-established risk factors for Alzheimer's are genetics and aging, "there is hope that adopting healthy brain life habits might delay or prevent the appearance of Alzheimer's disease," the Alzheimer's Association says. Here are some tips: Stay physically active to maintain good blood flow to the brain and encourage new brain cells. Eat a "brain-healthy diet" low in fat and cholesterol. Stay social to reduce stress levels and maintain healthy brain cell connections. Stay mentally active to strengthen brain cells and the connections between them. "There is a lot of concern and debate in the professional community at this point. It has been very disappointing." Around 47 million people currently live with dementia worldwide, with Alzheimer's estimated to account for 60 to 80% of dementia cases. This figure is expected to double every 20 years to reach 131 million people in 2050, according to Alzheimer's Disease International. Years of testing, trials It has now been over a decade since a new drug for alleviating the symptoms of Alzheimer's was made available. There is currently no treatment that has been proven to slow the impact of the disease, which causes a gradual decline in memory and thinking skills and eventually leaves sufferers unable to care for themselves. "We really don't know the causal pathway that causes the loss of connection in the brain that results in the loss of cognitive abilities [in Alzheimer's patients]," said Breitner. "Despite 25 years of trying to figure out what is going on and what is the appropriate target for treatment, we still don't know." There have been many successful studies that have "cured" or reduced memory loss in transgenic lab animals such as rats, which have been bred with human genes as a model for Alzheimer's. But this success has so far never been replicated in humans. JUST WATCHED How Alzheimer's destroys the brain Replay More Videos ...

While the ultimate cause of cell death and tissue loss in the brain of Alzheimer's patients has never been proven, amyloid plaque build-up between nerve cells in the brain has been long suspected as one of the main causes of the disease. However, the failure of verubecestat adds to growing concerns that this underlying assumption, known as beta amyloid theory, is wrong. There are several pharma companies currently trialling BACE inhibitors in the hope of finding a cure, including AstraZeneca and its research partner Eli Lilly, Novartis in collaboration with Amgen, as well as Janssen and Biogen. "Alzheimer's is a terrible disease and we desperately need treatments. There would be a huge market for a successful drug," said Brietner. "Until now companies have been willing to take the risk [by investing large sums of money in clinical trials]. But at the moment a lot of things are being reassessed." Continuing the fight against Alzheimer's "This isn't the end for beta amyloid theory, just yet," said Professor Bryce Vissel, the Roth Fellow and director of the Centre of Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine at University of Technology Sydney. "There's a trial of another important drug for Alzheimer's, aducanumab, being run by Biogen -- another pharmaceutical company -- which has shown interesting and encouraging signs." "We must continue to pursue this disease," said Vissel. "There's good reason to have hope and optimism that with the pursuit of excellent science and some rethinking about [Alzheimer's], a treatment will become available for this devastating disease in our lifetimes." The results of Merck's trial of verubecestat on patients with early stage Alzheimer's are expected in February 2019. Merck's shares fell by nearly 2% following Tuesday's announcement.

While the ultimate cause of cell death and tissue loss in the brain of Alzheimer's patients has never been proven, amyloid plaque build-up between nerve cells in the brain has been long suspected as one of the main causes of the disease. However, the failure of verubecestat adds to growing concerns that this underlying assumption, known as beta amyloid theory, is wrong. There are several pharma companies currently trialling BACE inhibitors in the hope of finding a cure, including AstraZeneca and its research partner Eli Lilly, Novartis in collaboration with Amgen, as well as Janssen and Biogen. "Alzheimer's is a terrible disease and we desperately need treatments. There would be a huge market for a successful drug," said Brietner. "Until now companies have been willing to take the risk [by investing large sums of money in clinical trials]. But at the moment a lot of things are being reassessed." Continuing the fight against Alzheimer's "This isn't the end for beta amyloid theory, just yet," said Professor Bryce Vissel, the Roth Fellow and director of the Centre of Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine at University of Technology Sydney. "There's a trial of another important drug for Alzheimer's, aducanumab, being run by Biogen -- another pharmaceutical company -- which has shown interesting and encouraging signs." "We must continue to pursue this disease," said Vissel. "There's good reason to have hope and optimism that with the pursuit of excellent science and some rethinking about [Alzheimer's], a treatment will become available for this devastating disease in our lifetimes." The results of Merck's trial of verubecestat on patients with early stage Alzheimer's are expected in February 2019. Merck's shares fell by nearly 2% following Tuesday's announcement.

It comes just three months after Eli Lilly announced that it was ending the clinical trial of its Alzheimer’s drug solanezumab, after patients taking it demonstrated no signs of improvement compared to those taking a placebo. “While we are disappointed that a benefit was not observed in this study, our work continues [to study the impact of] verubecestat in people with less advanced disease,” said Dr Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories. Experts say the failure of the drug on people with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s was a substantial setback. “There were high hopes that [the trial] might succeed,” Professor John Breitner, Canada research chair in prevention of dementia and professor of geriatric psychiatry and preventive medicine at McGill University told CNN. “There is a lot of concern and debate in the professional community at this point. It has been very disappointing.” Around 47 million people currently live with dementia worldwide, with Alzheimer’s estimated to account for 60 to 80% of dementia cases. This figure is expected to double every 20 years to reach 131 million people in 2050, according to Alzheimer’s Disease International. Years of testing, trials It has now been over a decade since a new drug for alleviating the symptoms of Alzheimer’s was made available. There is currently no treatment that has been proven to slow the impact of the disease, which causes a gradual decline in memory and thinking skills and eventually leaves sufferers unable to care for themselves. “We really don’t know the causal pathway that causes the loss of connection in the brain that results in the loss of cognitive abilities [in Alzheimer’s patients],” said Breitner. “Despite 25 years of trying to figure out what is going on and what is the appropriate target for treatment, we still don’t know.” There have been many successful studies that have “cured” or reduced memory loss in transgenic lab animals such as rats, which have been bred with human genes as a model for Alzheimer’s. But this success has so far never been replicated in humans.

Pharma Merck halts late-stage Alzheimer’s trial due to lack of efficacy By Juliet Preston Post a comment / Feb 14, 2017 at 7:41 PM Shares7 Failure continues to haunt the Alzheimer’s field. The latest blow came late on Tuesday at the hands of Merck, with news that its Phase 2/3 trial of verubecestat had been stopped due to a lack of efficacy. The Data Monitoring Committee for its EPOCH study in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease concluded that there was “virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect.” Merck shares fell 1.5 percent as after-hours trading began. According to ClinicalTrials.gov the EPOCH study was slated to run from Nov. 2012 to July 2019. The silver lining is that the drug’s safety profile remains sound, justifying the continuation of Merck’s other late-stage trial of verubecestat in patients with a subtype of Alzheimer’s known as prodromal AD. The question of efficacy is far more deeply-rooted. Verubecestat targets BACE1, an enzyme associated with the production of amyloid beta. Many in the scientific community believe amyloid plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease. By Inhibiting BACE1, verubecestat should theoretically have reduced the formation of amyloid plaques in patients’ brains and slowed symptom progression. This clearly hasn’t eventuated, said Andrew Budson, an Alzheimer’s clinician, professor of neurology at Boston University and author of an upcoming book about the disease. In an email, Budson said many different approaches are needed to increase the odds of success. BACE inhibitors stop the formation of beta amyloid. If the drug worked as was intended and yet did not stop disease progression, it might suggest that treatment needs to be initiated prior to the mild-to-moderate stage. Although I remain hopeful that anti-amyloid pharmacological approaches to treating Alzheimer’s disease will be beneficial, I cannot deny the fact that each negative trial result reduces my hope that the next one will be successful. This negative result for an amyloid-based approach also makes the current efforts to find additional symptomatic therapies and those that can reduce downstream neurodegeneration more important. Today’s results will likely reverberate throughout the field, negatively impacting companies invested in the amyloid hypothesis. It follows other high-profile failures, such as Eli Lilly’s solanezumab. In December, solanezumab flopped in its second major Phase 3 trial. The drug attempted to bind beta-amyloid in the bloodstream to prevent it from accumulating in the brain. Lilly has also invested in BACE inhibitors, signing a partnership with AstraZeneca in 2014 and proceeding into a pivotal Phase 2/3 trial. Data from that study is expected in May 2019. Biogen and Eisai are also pursuing an oral BACE inhibitor, E2609. In 2016, the companies moved the drug into a Phase 3 trial using the highest of three doses evaluated in the Phase 2 study. Once again, no major safety issues have arisen. But the pressure is on to prove efficacy.

Login Search Merck To Stop EPOCH Study; Doravirine Meets Primary Efficacy Endpoint February 14, 2017, 06:30:00 PM EDT By RTT News Shutterstock photo (RTTNews.com) - Merck ( MRK ) announced it will be stopping protocol 017, also known as the EPOCH study, a Phase 2/3 study evaluating verubecestat, an investigational small molecule inhibitor of the beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 in people with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. Merck is stopping the study following the recommendation of the external Data Monitoring Committee, which assessed overall benefit/risk during a recent interim safety analysis, and determined that there was virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect. The eDMC recommended that protocol 019, also known as APECS, which is evaluating verubecestat in people with prodromal Alzheimer's disease, continue unchanged. Results from protocol 019 are expected in February 2019. Separately, Merck announced results of a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of doravirine (MK-1439), an investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. The study met its primary efficacy endpoint of the proportion of participants achieving levels of HIV-1RNA less than 50 copies/mL after 48 weeks of treatment, demonstrating the non-inferiority of once-daily doravirine to once-daily ritonavir-boosted darunavir, each administered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine or abacavir/lamivudine, in previously untreated (treatment-naÃ¯ve) adults with HIV-1 infection.

The company was testing its drug, verubecestat, in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. But an independent data monitoring committee determined that there was "virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect" and recommended the trial be stopped for futility. The news sent Merck shares down nearly 2 percent in after hours trading. Verubecestat belongs to a class of experimental Alzheimer's drugs called BACE1 inhibitors that target an enzyme involved in the formation of the toxic amyloid protein that turns into plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. Several companies are pinning hopes on Alzheimer's treatments using the BASE inhibitor mechanism, including Eli Lilly and Co, Biogen and Novartis in collaboration with Amgen Inc. Lilly previously endured multiple failures with its solanezumab, which also targets beta amyloid, but in a different way. In the most recent setback, Lilly said that drug failed to slow declines in mental capacity of patients with even mild symptoms. Researchers are increasingly focusing on attacking the disease earlier as it appears likely that once symptoms have taken hold current approaches fail to work. Merck said another study of its drug in patients with prodromal, or very early, Alzheimer's disease would continue with results expected by February 2019. Patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease have objective memory problems but relatively normal functioning in activities of daily living. Blinded clinical trials use independent monitors to watch for any unexpected safety problems that may crop up. They can also recommend stopping a study early if it becomes clear that a drug is going to fail or if the data looks so compelling that it believes the treatment should be offered to those getting a placebo or other standard treatments. Merck shares fell to $64.48 in extended trading from a close at $65.66.

The company's shares were down 2.4 percent at $64.06 in after-market trading on Tuesday. Merck said the external data monitoring committee, which assessed overall benefit or risk of verubecestat, determined that there was "virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect". Patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease exhibit detectable and worsening impairment of cognitive and functional abilities. The company's announcement comes nearly three months after Eli Lilly and Co said its Alzheimer's treatment failed to slow declines in mental capacity of patients with even mild symptoms. Merck said that another late-stage study for the treatment of people with prodromal Alzheimer's disease would continue and results from the study are expected by February 2019. Patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease have objective memory problems but relatively normal functioning in activities of daily living.

(NYSE: MRK) added its verubecestat to the list of inefficacious treatments. The series of failed tests have inspired questions about the amyloid hypothesis on which recent treatments rest. The hypothesis entertains the idea that clearing beta amyloid buildups in the brain could cure Alzheimer's. “It is too early to speculate on what the EPOCH trial results mean for the validity of the amyloid hypothesis,” said Pamela Eisele, a spokesperson for Merck. Related Link: Taking A Clinical Road Less Traveled: Neurotrope Hopes To Succeed In Alzheimer's Where Competitors Fail The company noted in its press release it will continue studying verubecestat in patients with prodromal Alzheimer’s disease — a condition known as APECS. “It is hoped that by evaluating verubecestat in people at the earlier prodromal stage, who have lower levels of damage to the brain, we will be better able to slow disease progression,” Eisele said. “This trial is fully enrolled and the results are expected to be available in February 2019.” Merck's stock closed Wednesday at $65.16.

(NYSE: MRK) saw its shares slip on Wednesday after the firm reported that it will be halting its mid-to-late-stage clinical trial for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Unfortunately, this is not the first time this year that Merck has received bad news for its Alzheimer’s study. The company is stopping the Phase 2/3 study following the recommendation of the external Data Monitoring Committee (eDMC). In a recent safety analysis, the eDMC assessed the benefit/risk of the EPOCH study, also known as protocol 017, for Alzheimer’s and determined that there was “virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect.” The committee further noted that safety signals observed in the study “are not sufficient to warrant stopping study 017,” and recommended that protocol 019, also known as APECS, which is evaluating verubecestat in people with prodromal Alzheimer’s disease, continue unchanged. The results from protocol 019 are expected in February 2019. Results from EPOCH will be analyzed and presented at an upcoming scientific meeting. The efficacy and safety of verubecestat was being evaluated in two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials: Protocol 017, or EPOCH, in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s, and Protocol 019, or APECS, in prodromal Alzheimer’s. There is a slight difference in each. Patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s exhibit detectable and worsening impairment of cognitive and functional abilities. Patients with prodromal Alzheimer’s have objective memory problems but relatively normal functioning in activities of daily living. Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories, commented: Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most pressing and daunting medical issues of our time, with inherent, substantial challenges to developing an effective disease-modifying therapy for people with mild-to-moderate disease. Studies such as EPOCH are critical, and we are indebted to the patients in this study and their caregivers. While we are disappointed that a benefit was not observed in this study, our work continues with APECS, which is studying verubecestat in people with less advanced disease. Shares of Merck were trading down 0.5% at $65.30 on Wednesday, with a consensus analyst price target of $68.55 and a 52-week trading range of $49.63 to $65.87.

Meanwhile, treatments for mental illnesses have seen few advances despite increased understanding of the diseases. Stat: The Next Big Alzheimer's Trial Came Up A Dud Merck pulled the plug on a closely watched trial in Alzheimer’s disease after finding out its in-development drug had no effect on patients with mild forms of the disorder. The drug, verubecestat, showed “virtually no chance” of meeting its goal in a 2,200-patient study, Merck said. The trial was meant to read out later this year, but Merck, on the advice of its independent data monitors, pulled the plug early. (Garde, 2/14) Stat: Scouring The Brain For Clues To New Treatments For Mental Illness While demand for mental health drugs has surged, big pharmaceutical companies have largely backed away from investing in the field; the number of psychopharmacological drug research programs has shrunk 70 percent in the last decade, according to NeuroPerspective...To advance the field, researchers say they need to find biomarkers — tangible biological clues that can help diagnose mental illness, just the way high blood glucose levels can signal diabetes. The hope is that those biomarkers could help pinpoint what’s gone wrong in the circuitry of a particular patient’s brain and offer clues for drug development — and, perhaps one day, even precision psychiatric therapies.

PepsiCo gave a full-year outlook that fell slightly below Street forecasts, with CEO Indra Nooyi saying the company expects global economic challenges this year. Anthem — Anthem filed suit against Cigna, seeking a temporary restraining order against Cigna's move to end their $48 billion deal. Cigna had sued Anthem late yesterday, saying regulatory hurdles mean that Anthem's planned purchase of Cigna cannot possibly be completed, and seeking a multibillion-dollar reverse breakup fee. Hilton Worldwide — The hotel operator beat estimates by 5 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of 70 cents per share. Revenue also beat forecasts. Hilton was helped by increased bookings at higher prices.

Merck — The drugmaker halted a late-stage trial of an experimental Alzheimer's treatment. Merck determined that the treatment was ineffective. Apple — Berkshire Hathaway nearly quadrupled its stake in Apple by buying 42 million more shares and benefiting from the rise to an all-time high yesterday.

Express Scripts — Express Scripts beat estimates by a penny a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.88 per share. The pharmacy benefit manager's revenue came in below Street forecasts and it also gave a lower-than-expected outlook for the current quarter. AIG — AIG took a $5.6 billion charge against earnings to boost reserves for claims, dragging the insurance company's quarterly loss well below estimates at $2.72 per share. However, AIG also announced a $3.5 billion stock buyback program, following strong results in areas such as consumer insurance. Fossil — Fossil earned $1.03 per share for the fourth quarter, 15 cents a share shy of estimates. The watch maker's revenue also missed forecasts. Fossil also gave worse-than-expected guidance for the current quarter, with ongoing impact from currency fluctuations, as well as a decline in overall sales of traditional watches. Humana — Humana announced a $1.5 billion stock buyback and raised its quarterly dividend to 40 cents per share from the prior 29 cents a share. The news follows the end of its deal to merge with Aetna, which was announced on Tuesday morning. Procter & Gamble — Activist investor Trian Fund Management has taken a stake in P&G now worth $3.5 billion, according to Trian's quarterly SEC filing. The consumer products giant represents Trian's largest-ever holding, as measured by dollar value.

CSX — The railroad operator is asking shareholders to vote on compensation benefits for prospective CEO Hunter Harrison, and on demands by activist investor Paul Hilal that his fund, Mantle Ridge, be reimbursed for "exceptionally unusual" compensation benefits for Harrison. The vote has not yet been scheduled, but was called for after talks between CSX and Hilal fell apart.

The prospect of big change at the regulatory agency comes as drugmakers are under fire for high prices, including Marathon Pharmaceuticals LLC, which said Monday it was "pausing" the launch of its Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug after U.S. lawmakers questioned its $89,000 a year price. Industry trade group Biotechnology Innovation Organization told Reuters that during high-level discussions with Trump advisors, lobbyists urged the administration not to name a new commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration who would act rashly to speed up the agency's approval of new medicines. That sentiment was echoed by executives at more than a dozen pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, who told Reuters that the FDA is already adopting new drug development models and warned that a looser review process would put patients at risk. "People often argue that the FDA is too restrictive," said Roger Perlmutter, head of research and development at Merck & Co Inc. "We have the sense that the balance is pretty right ... you have to have a well-characterized risk/benefit profile." That stance underscores the unique position the drug industry finds itself in when it comes to regulating its products. While most sectors welcome less oversight, drugmakers say a robust review process is critical in convincing physicians and insurers that a pricey new medicine has value. Otherwise, the time and money it takes to get a new drug to market - estimates run as high as $2.6 billion - would be lost if insurers are not willing to pay for the product. "It is great that the administration is seeking deregulation ... to make sure the private sector can be more competitive," said John Maraganore, chief executive officer at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc and co-chair of BIO's regulatory committee. "But payers are looking for evidence of value." He said the FDA should speed the approval of lower cost generic versions of drugs that have lost patent protection, but warned that allowing novel products to be launched without extensive testing could be dangerous. "Any change at the FDA that allows drugs to be tried out on patients without clinical evidence is a damaging approach," said Jeremy Levin, chief executive officer at Ovid Therapeutics Inc., which is developing drugs for rare diseases. Health insurers are pushing back against high-priced drugs. Sales of expensive new cholesterol drugs from Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc have stalled as insurers limit coverage until they see results of trials designed to prove that the drugs significantly lower the risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular crises. "It is one thing to get a drug approved, but you have got to get reimbursed," said Paul Perreault, CEO at biotech company CSL Ltd, adding that won't happen unless payers see proof that a new drug is better than what is already available. To be sure, some pharmaceutical executives have been vocal about the need for deregulation. Reducing regulation "will help with drug prices, because it will induce more competition," Pfizer Inc CEO Ian Read said on a recent conference call. After top executives at Merck, Johnson & Johnson and others met at the White House last month with Trump, who pledged to "streamline" the FDA, industry trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said the meeting found common ground such as tax reform, and removal of outdated regulations. The trade group declined to comment on changes at the FDA. The prospect of a shake-up at the FDA is being welcomed by a new class of investor with ambitions to disrupt the current drug development model, in which larger pharmaceutical players often buy or license early-stage medicines, and reap the bigger rewards if they succeed. "The system we have now has its roots 50, 60 even 70 years ago ... it has become incredibly expensive," said Tim Shannon, of venture capital firm Canaan Partners. He supports the notion that some prescription medications could reach the market, possibly at discounted prices, once testing shows they are safe. If such controlled usage indicates that they are also effective, prices could then be raised. "We want to make healthcare itself more efficient," he said. "Let the marketplace decide how valuable a drug is." The fate of deregulating the FDA will be driven by its next commissioner. President Trump said last month he has a "fantastic person" lined up for the role. Candidates, according to sources close to the administration, include former FDA staffer Scott Gottlieb, and Jim O'Neill, a colleague of Trump supporter Peter Thiel who has advocated for allowing some medicines to reach the market once they are shown to be safe, even if there is scant evidence that they work. A recent survey of drug company executives conducted by Mizuho Securities found that 72 percent said Gottlieb should be Trump's pick to head the FDA. "There is no groundswell of movement for change," said attorney Jim Shehan, head of Lowenstein Sandler's FDA regulatory practice. "The industry likes certainty."

NewsInferno The News That Matters About Us Contact Us Partnerships Sitemap 1-800-320-7000 Search for: Home Actos Metal-on-Metal Mirena Transvaginal Mesh Xarelto Zadroga Merck’s Implanon Tied to Device Migration Posted on February 14, 2017 by Cynthia A. Diaz-Shephard     Implanon Migration Leads to Unwanted Pregnancy, Surgery The Implanon (etonogestrel implant) birth control, is a small, thin implantable plastic rod that slowly releases etonogestrel. The device is meant to last three years and received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance one decade ago. Implanon birth control may last longer than three years; however, the three-year time frame is what is recommended to remove the nearly-spent Implanon for replacement, or to switch to an alternative birth control device. Twelve years prior, a research paper described the difficulty in extracting the six capsules that made up the prior Norplant implantable birth control system. The Implanon implantable birth control followed the Norplant. In the 23 years, concern has risen over similar implantable devices and the challenges in removing the device and device migration. Implanon birth control is one of the more recent devices approved for long-term, low maintenance birth control by implanting the device subcutaneously (under the skin) in the upper arm. The device is meant to distribute protection from unwanted pregnancy without the user having to remember to take a daily pill or change a birth control patch or other birth control device. The product liability attorneys at Parker Waichman are actively reviewing potential lawsuits regarding medical devices including the Implanon birth control device. Implanon Lawsuits and Research Meanwhile, plaintiffs have alleged, in Implanon birth control personal injury lawsuits, experiencing difficulty locating and extracting the used device at the end of its life cycle. In some cases, the Implanon device migrated away from the original insertion site during the three-to-four years that the device was in place. There are also documented cases in which the Implanon device was located far from the initial insertion point; for instance, in a blood vessel of the lung or where the device could not be located, according to Merck & Company, the maker of the device. One plaintiff alleged wrongful birth, after becoming pregnant. Merck & Co. through its subsidiary Organon, has released Implanon NXT and Nexplanon, updates to the Implanon device that includes barium sulfate added to the core of the device. Barium sulfate may be seen on X-rays, which helps clinicians locate a difficult-to-locate device. Problems associated with Implanon have not been sufficient to convince the FDA to mandate a removal of the Implanon implantable device from the market. This, despite a federal regulator mandated warning label update in March 2016 concerning the rare potential for device migration. The FDA indicates that it deems the implantable devices as safe and effective. Meanwhile, an Implanon birth control consumer fraud lawsuit was brought by a woman from Maine who was implanted with the Implanon birth control device early in 2012 following a recommendation she received from a community health clinic. Approximately 18 months later, when the birth control had only been through less than half of its life cycle, the woman tested positive for pregnancy, gave birth to a child, and became a single mother. Despite repeated attempts, clinicians were unable to locate the device. The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court, District of Maine over allegations of wrongful birth. Lawsuits alleging Implanon birth control consumer fraud include that patients were not fully aware of the potential for device migration, or the difficulty often faced when attempting to remove the device. Meanwhile, 20 years prior, a paper was published describing the difficulty in locating and removing the six capsules that were part of the Norplant device, which is no longer in use. “A case study was presented of one woman who asked for removal of the six small Norplant capsules (2.4 mm x 34 mm) that were inserted sub dermally, radially in the medial portion of the upper arm, per standard protocol,” the paper indicated. “The obstetrician made a surgical incision and removed easily five of the capsules, but could not locate the last one by digital probing. The patient was then referred to a hospital radiology department. The first action taken was a radiograph, which revealed a faint visualization. The second picture was taken with real time sonography, but the capsule could not be visualized. A third action was a computed tomography of multiple thin (3 mm) slices, but again there was no success in locating the missing capsule. The final attempt was to use intermittent fluoroscopy and persistent probing, which revealed the locale and led to successful removal of the last capsule.” In all, it took four attempts to locate and remove the sixth Norplant capsule. Wyeth, the maker of Norplant, withdrew the device from the market six years later, in 2000, and was facing a number of lawsuits over the product. Six years after that, the FDA cleared Implanon, without mentioning the potential for device migration until ten years later in 2016. Norplant was implanted in a similar way to the single-application Implanon, which has one rod or capsule. Now indicated in the listing of Implanon birth control side effects is that “Implants have been reported to be found in a blood vessel including a blood vessel in the lung.” Although the statement does not specifically reference device migration, it is inferred given the distance between the inner upper arm and the lung. Device migration is later addressed in the second paragraph on page eight under a sub-head “Problems with Insertion and Removal” that states, “Location and removal of the implant may be difficult or impossible because the implant is not where it should be. Special procedures, including surgery in the hospital, may be needed to remove the implant. If the implant is not removed, then the effects of IMPLANON (sic) will continue for a longer period of time. Implants have been found in the pulmonary artery (a blood vessel in the lung). If the implant cannot be found in the arm, your healthcare professional may use imaging methods on the chest. If the implant is located in the chest, surgery may be needed.” Legal Advice and Information Regarding Implanon If you or someone you know suffered injuries associated with the Implanon birth control device, you may have valuable legal rights.

The company was testing its drug, verubecestat, in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. But an independent data monitoring committee determined that there was "virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect" and recommended the trial be stopped for futility. The news sent Merck shares down nearly 2 percent in after hours trading. Verubecestat belongs to a class of experimental Alzheimer's drugs called BACE1 inhibitors that target an enzyme involved in the formation of the toxic amyloid protein that turns into plaques in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. Several companies are pinning hopes on Alzheimer's treatments using the BASE inhibitor mechanism, including Eli Lilly and Co, Biogen and Novartis in collaboration with Amgen Inc. Lilly previously endured multiple failures with its solanezumab, which also targets beta amyloid, but in a different way. In the most recent setback, Lilly said that drug failed to slow declines in mental capacity of patients with even mild symptoms. Researchers are increasingly focusing on attacking the disease earlier as it appears likely that once symptoms have taken hold current approaches fail to work. Merck said another study of its drug in patients with prodromal, or very early, Alzheimer's disease would continue with results expected by February 2019. Patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease have objective memory problems but relatively normal functioning in activities of daily living. Blinded clinical trials use independent monitors to watch for any unexpected safety problems that may crop up. They can also recommend stopping a study early if it becomes clear that a drug is going to fail or if the data looks so compelling that it believes the treatment should be offered to those getting a placebo or other standard treatments. Merck shares fell to $64.48 in extended trading from a close at $65.66.

An outside committee monitoring the study of more than 2,000 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s concluded there was “virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect” of the drug, verubecestat, Merck said.

The company was testing its drug, verubecestat, in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. But an independent data monitoring committee determined that there was "virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect" and recommended the trial be stopped for futility. The news sent Merck shares down nearly 2 percent in after hours trading. Verubecestat belongs to a class of experimental Alzheimer's drugs called BACE1 inhibitors that target an enzyme involved in the formation of the toxic amyloid protein that turns into plaques in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. Several companies are pinning hopes on Alzheimer's treatments using the BASE inhibitor mechanism, including Eli Lilly and Co, Biogen and Novartis in collaboration with Amgen Inc. Lilly previously endured multiple failures with its solanezumab, which also targets beta amyloid, but in a different way. In the most recent setback, Lilly said that drug failed to slow declines in mental capacity of patients with even mild symptoms. Researchers are increasingly focusing on attacking the disease earlier as it appears likely that once symptoms have taken hold current approaches fail to work. Merck said another study of its drug in patients with prodromal, or very early, Alzheimer's disease would continue with results expected by February 2019. Patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease have objective memory problems but relatively normal functioning in activities of daily living. Blinded clinical trials use independent monitors to watch for any unexpected safety problems that may crop up. They can also recommend stopping a study early if it becomes clear that a drug is going to fail or if the data looks so compelling that it believes the treatment should be offered to those getting a placebo or other standard treatments. Merck shares fell to $64.48 in extended trading from a close at $65.66.

(AP) — Merck & Co. will stop its study of an experimental Alzheimer’s drug in people with mild or moderate symptoms because interim results showed “virtually no chance” of any benefit. However, the drugmaker said Tuesday it will continue another study of the drug, verubecestat, in patients who don’t yet show symptoms. They have some memory problems, but can still perform daily activities. The two studies were intended to enable Merck to seek regulators’ approval to sell verubecestat.

Adam Feuerstein Feb 14, 2017 5:38 PM EST Another Alzheimer's disease drug has failed to help patients.  This time, it's verubecestat, a BACE inhibitor from Merck (MRK) . On Tuesday night, the pharma giant said a phase II/III study of verubecestat was shutting down following an interim analysis conducted by independent study monitors. The monitors concluded that there was "virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect." The phase II/III study, dubbed EPOCH, enrolled patients with mild to moderate Alzheimers disease. Merck said a separate clinical trial of verubecestat being conducted in patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease is continuing, with results expected in February 2019.  "Alzheimer's disease is one of the most pressing and daunting medical issues of our time, with inherent, substantial challenges to developing an effective disease-modifying therapy for people with mild-to-moderate disease. Studies such as EPOCH are critical, and we are indebted to the patients in this study and their caregivers," said Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories, in a statement. "While we are disappointed that a benefit was not observed in this study, our work continues with APECS, which is studying verubecestat in people with less advanced disease."

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint Dementia has unseated AIDS as one of the world’s top killers, new figures from the World Health Organization show, as drugmakers struggle to either curb or cure it. Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia killed 1.54 million people in 2015, more than twice the number of deaths from the disease in 2000, according to documents posted on the WHO website. It replaced HIV/AIDS as No. 7 on the global health watchdog’s list of the 10 biggest causes of death worldwide. New therapies helped push fatalities from HIV/AIDS from 1.5 million down to 1.1 million over the same 15-year period. Drugmakers have struggled to understand Alzheimer’s, with Merck & Co. abandoning a high-profile study this week, less than three months after a similar defeat for Eli Lilly & Co. More than 100 experimental treatments have failed to slow the condition, which dismantles memories and leaves patients incapacitated. Dementia afflicts some 47 million worldwide, and the number will probably rise to 75 million by 2030, said Shekhar Saxena, director of the WHO’s department of mental health. “We are making slow progress,” Saxena said, calling for more public money to be directed toward developing treatments. “I am less optimistic than I would like to be.” Dementia’s climb up the WHO ranking is partly due to the aging of society, and partly to doctors diagnosing it more frequently because they are more familiar with the disease, he said. In high-income economies, Alzheimer’s and other dementia rank as the No. 3 cause of death, trailing only heart disease and stroke. By contrast, HIV/AIDS remains on the top 10 list in the poorest countries, alongside problems such as malaria and diarrhea. The most recent drug to help treat symptoms of Alzheimer’s is more than a decade old, and there is no cure. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported more evidence of progress against HIV in the U.S. this week, citing an 18 percent decline in the number of U.S. infections between 2008 and 2014. Heterosexuals saw a 36 percent decline, and intravenous-drug users experienced a 56 percent drop. The estimated number of infections fell from 45,700 in 2008 to 37,600 in 2014.

23.9% - Research and Markets News provided by Research and Markets Feb 15, 2017, 13:10 ET Share this article DUBLIN, Feb. 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Global Cancer Immunotherapies Market to 2022 - Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors and Therapeutic Cancer Vaccines to Characterize Increasingly Competitive Market" report to their offering. The market size for cancer immunotherapies is expected to grow more than fourfold from $16.9 billion in 2015 to $75.8 billion by 2022, representing a rapid compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.9%. The imbalance between early-stage and late-stage product development is more pronounced than typically seen in the industry, and may suggest greater difficulty than normal in developing cancer immunotherapies. However, these findings may also indicate a substantial drive to invest in early-stage cancer immunotherapy development, which could eventually filter through to late-stage product development. According to the research, several late-stage pipeline drugs, as well as some already marketed drugs, are expected to achieve blockbuster status by the end of the forecast period, while a number of existing blockbuster therapies are forecast to experience strong revenue growth. Established immunotherapies, particularly Revlimid, Opdivo, Keytruda and Gazyva, are set to witness rapid sales growth throughout the forecast period, with Keytruda and Opdivo rising by $7 billion and $9 billion, respectively. Revlimid will experience similar levels of growth, driven by label expansions covering oncology indications, including multiple forms of leukemia and lymphoma.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    U.S. President Donald Trump's vow to roll back government regulations at least 75 percent is causing anxiety for some pharmaceutical executives that a less robust Food and Drug Administration would make it harder to secure insurance coverage for pricey new medicines. The prospect of big change at the regulatory agency comes as drugmakers are under fire for high prices, including Marathon Pharmaceuticals LLC, which said Monday it was "pausing" the launch of its Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug after U.S. lawmakers questioned its $89,000 a year price. Industry trade group Biotechnology Innovation Organization told Reuters that during high-level discussions with Trump advisors, lobbyists urged the administration not to name a new commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration who would act rashly to speed up the agency's approval of new medicines. That sentiment was echoed by executives at more than a dozen pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, who told Reuters that the FDA is already adopting new drug development models and warned that a looser review process would put patients at risk. "People often argue that the FDA is too restrictive," said Roger Perlmutter, head of research and development at Merck & Co Inc. "We have the sense that the balance is pretty right ... you have to have a well-characterized risk/benefit profile." That stance underscores the unique position the drug industry finds itself in when it comes to regulating its products. While most sectors welcome less oversight, drugmakers say a robust review process is critical in convincing physicians and insurers that a pricey new medicine has value. Otherwise, the time and money it takes to get a new drug to market - estimates run as high as $2.6 billion - would be lost if insurers are not willing to pay for the product. "It is great that the administration is seeking deregulation ... to make sure the private sector can be more competitive," said John Maraganore, chief executive officer at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc and co-chair of BIO's regulatory committee. "But payers are looking for evidence of value." He said the FDA should speed the approval of lower cost generic versions of drugs that have lost patent protection, but warned that allowing novel products to be launched without extensive testing could be dangerous. "Any change at the FDA that allows drugs to be tried out on patients without clinical evidence is a damaging approach," said Jeremy Levin, chief executive officer at Ovid Therapeutics Inc., which is developing drugs for rare diseases. Health insurers are pushing back against high-priced drugs. Sales of expensive new cholesterol drugs from Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc have stalled as insurers limit coverage until they see results of trials designed to prove that the drugs significantly lower the risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular crises. "It is one thing to get a drug approved, but you have got to get reimbursed," said Paul Perreault, CEO at biotech company CSL Ltd, adding that won't happen unless payers see proof that a new drug is better than what is already available. To be sure, some pharmaceutical executives have been vocal about the need for deregulation. Reducing regulation "will help with drug prices, because it will induce more competition," Pfizer Inc CEO Ian Read said on a recent conference call. After top executives at Merck, Johnson & Johnson and others met at the White House last month with Trump, who pledged to "streamline" the FDA, industry trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said the meeting found common ground such as tax reform, and removal of outdated regulations. The trade group declined to comment on changes at the FDA. The prospect of a shake-up at the FDA is being welcomed by a new class of investor with ambitions to disrupt the current drug development model, in which larger pharmaceutical players often buy or license early-stage medicines, and reap the bigger rewards if they succeed. "The system we have now has its roots 50, 60 even 70 years ago ... it has become incredibly expensive," said Tim Shannon, of venture capital firm Canaan Partners. He supports the notion that some prescription medications could reach the market, possibly at discounted prices, once testing shows they are safe. If such controlled usage indicates that they are also effective, prices could then be raised. "We want to make healthcare itself more efficient," he said. "Let the marketplace decide how valuable a drug is." The fate of deregulating the FDA will be driven by its next commissioner. President Trump said last month he has a "fantastic person" lined up for the role. Candidates, according to sources close to the administration, include former FDA staffer Scott Gottlieb, and Jim O'Neill, a colleague of Trump supporter Peter Thiel who has advocated for allowing some medicines to reach the market once they are shown to be safe, even if there is scant evidence that they work. A recent survey of drug company executives conducted by Mizuho Securities found that 72 percent said Gottlieb should be Trump's pick to head the FDA. "There is no groundswell of movement for change," said attorney Jim Shehan, head of Lowenstein Sandler's FDA regulatory practice. "The industry likes certainty."  © 2017 Thomson/Reuters.

The prospect of big change at the regulatory agency comes as drugmakers are under fire for high prices, including Marathon Pharmaceuticals LLC, which said Monday it was "pausing" the launch of its Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug after U.S. lawmakers questioned its $89,000 a year price. Industry trade group Biotechnology Innovation Organization told Reuters that during high-level discussions with Trump advisors, lobbyists urged the administration not to name a new commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration who would act rashly to speed up the agency’s approval of new medicines. That sentiment was echoed by executives at more than a dozen pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, who told Reuters that the FDA is already adopting new drug development models and warned that a looser review process would put patients at risk. "People often argue that the FDA is too restrictive," said Roger Perlmutter, head of research and development at Merck & Co Inc. "We have the sense that the balance is pretty right ... you have to have a well-characterized risk/benefit profile." That stance underscores the unique position the drug industry finds itself in when it comes to regulating its products. While most sectors welcome less oversight, drugmakers say a robust review process is critical in convincing physicians and insurers that a pricey new medicine has value. Otherwise, the time and money it takes to get a new drug to market - estimates run as high as $2.6 billion - would be lost if insurers are not willing to pay for the product. "It is great that the administration is seeking deregulation ... to make sure the private sector can be more competitive," said John Maraganore, chief executive officer at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc and co-chair of BIO's regulatory committee. "But payers are looking for evidence of value." He said the FDA should speed the approval of lower cost generic versions of drugs that have lost patent protection, but warned that allowing novel products to be launched without extensive testing could be dangerous. "Any change at the FDA that allows drugs to be tried out on patients without clinical evidence is a damaging approach," said Jeremy Levin, chief executive officer at Ovid Therapeutics Inc., which is developing drugs for rare diseases. Health insurers are pushing back against high-priced drugs. Sales of expensive new cholesterol drugs from Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc have stalled as insurers limit coverage until they see results of trials designed to prove that the drugs significantly lower the risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular crises. "It is one thing to get a drug approved, but you have got to get reimbursed," said Paul Perreault, CEO at biotech company CSL Ltd, adding that won't happen unless payers see proof that a new drug is better than what is already available. To be sure, some pharmaceutical executives have been vocal about the need for deregulation. Reducing regulation "will help with drug prices, because it will induce more competition," Pfizer Inc CEO Ian Read said on a recent conference call. After top executives at Merck, Johnson & Johnson and others met at the White House last month with Trump, who pledged to “streamline” the FDA, industry trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said the meeting found common ground such as tax reform, and removal of outdated regulations. The trade group declined to comment on changes at the FDA. The prospect of a shake-up at the FDA is being welcomed by a new class of investor with ambitions to disrupt the current drug development model, in which larger pharmaceutical players often buy or license early-stage medicines, and reap the bigger rewards if they succeed. "The system we have now has its roots 50, 60 even 70 years ago ... it has become incredibly expensive," said Tim Shannon, of venture capital firm Canaan Partners. He supports the notion that some prescription medications could reach the market, possibly at discounted prices, once testing shows they are safe. If such controlled usage indicates that they are also effective, prices could then be raised. "We want to make healthcare itself more efficient," he said. "Let the marketplace decide how valuable a drug is." The fate of deregulating the FDA will be driven by its next commissioner. President Trump said last month he has a "fantastic person" lined up for the role. Candidates, according to sources close to the administration, include former FDA staffer Scott Gottlieb, and Jim O'Neill, a colleague of Trump supporter Peter Thiel who has advocated for allowing some medicines to reach the market once they are shown to be safe, even if there is scant evidence that they work. A recent survey of drug company executives conducted by Mizuho Securities found that 72 percent said Gottlieb should be Trump's pick to head the FDA. "There is no groundswell of movement for change," said attorney Jim Shehan, head of Lowenstein Sandler's FDA regulatory practice. "The industry likes certainty."

REUTERS/Jason Reed/File Photo By Deena Beasley U.S. President Donald Trump's vow to roll back government regulations at least 75 percent is causing anxiety for some pharmaceutical executives that a less robust Food and Drug Administration would make it harder to secure insurance coverage for pricey new medicines. The prospect of big change at the regulatory agency comes as drugmakers are under fire for high prices, including Marathon Pharmaceuticals LLC, which said Monday it was "pausing" the launch of its Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug after U.S. lawmakers questioned its $89,000 a year price. Industry trade group Biotechnology Innovation Organization told Reuters that during high-level discussions with Trump advisors, lobbyists urged the administration not to name a new commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration who would act rashly to speed up the agency’s approval of new medicines. That sentiment was echoed by executives at more than a dozen pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, who told Reuters that the FDA is already adopting new drug development models and warned that a looser review process would put patients at risk. "People often argue that the FDA is too restrictive," said Roger Perlmutter, head of research and development at Merck & Co Inc. "We have the sense that the balance is pretty right ... you have to have a well-characterized risk/benefit profile." That stance underscores the unique position the drug industry finds itself in when it comes to regulating its products. While most sectors welcome less oversight, drugmakers say a robust review process is critical in convincing physicians and insurers that a pricey new medicine has value. Otherwise, the time and money it takes to get a new drug to market - estimates run as high as $2.6 billion - would be lost if insurers are not willing to pay for the product. "It is great that the administration is seeking deregulation ... to make sure the private sector can be more competitive," said John Maraganore, chief executive officer at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc and co-chair of BIO's regulatory committee. "But payers are looking for evidence of value." He said the FDA should speed the approval of lower cost generic versions of drugs that have lost patent protection, but warned that allowing novel products to be launched without extensive testing could be dangerous. "Any change at the FDA that allows drugs to be tried out on patients without clinical evidence is a damaging approach," said Jeremy Levin, chief executive officer at Ovid Therapeutics Inc., which is developing drugs for rare diseases. Health insurers are pushing back against high-priced drugs. Sales of expensive new cholesterol drugs from Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc have stalled as insurers limit coverage until they see results of trials designed to prove that the drugs significantly lower the risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular crises. "It is one thing to get a drug approved, but you have got to get reimbursed," said Paul Perreault, CEO at biotech company CSL Ltd, adding that won't happen unless payers see proof that a new drug is better than what is already available. To be sure, some pharmaceutical executives have been vocal about the need for deregulation. Reducing regulation "will help with drug prices, because it will induce more competition," Pfizer Inc CEO Ian Read said on a recent conference call. After top executives at Merck, Johnson & Johnson and others met at the White House last month with Trump, who pledged to “streamline” the FDA, industry trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said the meeting found common ground such as tax reform, and removal of outdated regulations. The trade group declined to comment on changes at the FDA. The prospect of a shake-up at the FDA is being welcomed by a new class of investor with ambitions to disrupt the current drug development model, in which larger pharmaceutical players often buy or license early-stage medicines, and reap the bigger rewards if they succeed. "The system we have now has its roots 50, 60 even 70 years ago ... it has become incredibly expensive," said Tim Shannon, of venture capital firm Canaan Partners. He supports the notion that some prescription medications could reach the market, possibly at discounted prices, once testing shows they are safe. If such controlled usage indicates that they are also effective, prices could then be raised. "We want to make healthcare itself more efficient," he said. "Let the marketplace decide how valuable a drug is." The fate of deregulating the FDA will be driven by its next commissioner. President Trump said last month he has a "fantastic person" lined up for the role. Candidates, according to sources close to the administration, include former FDA staffer Scott Gottlieb, and Jim O'Neill, a colleague of Trump supporter Peter Thiel who has advocated for allowing some medicines to reach the market once they are shown to be safe, even if there is scant evidence that they work. A recent survey of drug company executives conducted by Mizuho Securities found that 72 percent said Gottlieb should be Trump's pick to head the FDA. "There is no groundswell of movement for change," said attorney Jim Shehan, head of Lowenstein Sandler's FDA regulatory practice. "The industry likes certainty."

Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here US President Donald Trump's vow to roll back government regulations at least 75 percent is causing anxiety for some pharmaceutical executives that a less robust Food and Drug Administration would make it harder to secure insurance coverage for pricey new medicines. The prospect of big change at the regulatory agency comes as drugmakers are under fire for high prices, including Marathon Pharmaceuticals LLC, which said Monday it was "pausing" the launch of its Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug after US lawmakers questioned its $89,000 a year price. Industry trade group Biotechnology Innovation Organization told Reuters that during high-level discussions with Trump advisors, lobbyists urged the administration not to name a new commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration who would act rashly to speed up the agency's approval of new medicines. That sentiment was echoed by executives at more than a dozen pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, who told Reuters that the FDA is already adopting new drug development models and warned that a looser review process would put patients at risk. "People often argue that the FDA is too restrictive," said Roger Perlmutter, head of research and development at Merck & Co Inc. "We have the sense that the balance is pretty right ... you have to have a well-characterized risk/benefit profile." That stance underscores the unique position the drug industry finds itself in when it comes to regulating its products. While most sectors welcome less oversight, drugmakers say a robust review process is critical in convincing physicians and insurers that a pricey new medicine has value. Otherwise, the time and money it takes to get a new drug to market - estimates run as high as $2.6 billion - would be lost if insurers are not willing to pay for the product. "It is great that the administration is seeking deregulation ... to make sure the private sector can be more competitive," said John Maraganore, chief executive officer at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc and co-chair of BIO's regulatory committee. "But payers are looking for evidence of value." He said the FDA should speed the approval of lower cost generic versions of drugs that have lost patent protection, but warned that allowing novel products to be launched without extensive testing could be dangerous. "Any change at the FDA that allows drugs to be tried out on patients without clinical evidence is a damaging approach," said Jeremy Levin, chief executive officer at Ovid Therapeutics Inc., which is developing drugs for rare diseases. Health insurers are pushing back against high-priced drugs. Sales of expensive new cholesterol drugs from Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc have stalled as insurers limit coverage until they see results of trials designed to prove that the drugs significantly lower the risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular crises. "It is one thing to get a drug approved, but you have got to get reimbursed," said Paul Perreault, CEO at biotech company CSL Ltd, adding that won't happen unless payers see proof that a new drug is better than what is already available. To be sure, some pharmaceutical executives have been vocal about the need for deregulation. Reducing regulation "will help with drug prices, because it will induce more competition," Pfizer Inc CEO Ian Read said on a recent conference call. After top executives at Merck, Johnson & Johnson and others met at the White House last month with Trump, who pledged to "streamline" the FDA, industry trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said the meeting found common ground such as tax reform, and removal of outdated regulations. The trade group declined to comment on changes at the FDA. The prospect of a shake-up at the FDA is being welcomed by a new class of investor with ambitions to disrupt the current drug development model, in which larger pharmaceutical players often buy or license early-stage medicines, and reap the bigger rewards if they succeed. "The system we have now has its roots 50, 60 even 70 years ago ... it has become incredibly expensive," said Tim Shannon, of venture capital firm Canaan Partners. He supports the notion that some prescription medications could reach the market, possibly at discounted prices, once testing shows they are safe. If such controlled usage indicates that they are also effective, prices could then be raised. "We want to make healthcare itself more efficient," he said.

A recent survey of drug company executives conducted by Mizuho Securities found that 72 percent said Gottlieb should be Trump's pick to head the FDA. "There is no groundswell of movement for change," said attorney Jim Shehan, head of Lowenstein Sandler's FDA regulatory practice. "The industry likes certainty."

George Budwell, Keith Speights, and Cory Renauer (TMFGBudwell) Feb 14, 2017 at 4:21PM The first-quarter of 2017 is already chock-full of weighty news events and potential catalysts that have investors' collective heads spinning. So while it may be tough to concentrate with so much going on, our Foolish contributors think that Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), and Lexicon Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:LXRX) deserve your attention right now. Read on to find out why.  Can Bristol-Myers Squibb rekindle the magic?  George Budwell (Bristol-Myers Squibb): Bristol-Myers Squibb's shares have now lost approximately 33% of their value from their former 52-week high. Long story short, the drugmaker's shares have basically been in free fall mode ever since its core immuno-oncology medicine, Opdivo, failed to show a clinical benefit in a pivotal-stage study for frontline non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Image Source: Getty Images. Besides wiping several billion in additional sales off the table -- at least in the near-term -- this clinical failure essentially handed over this extremely lucrative indication to Merck's competing therapy, Keytruda, and may have made Opdivo far less attractive to clinicians in the later line settings of the disease as well.  However, Bristol's meteoric descent is arguably way overdone at this point. The drugmaker's shares, after all, are currently trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 4.6, which is dirt cheap for a company with a top-notch oncology portfolio.  But the real reason this stock has my attention this quarter is because of the growing potential of a takeover bid. The big picture issue is that Opdivo is unquestionably a true backbone medicine that's eventually going to form the basis of numerous immuno-oncology therapies over the next decade. So with Bristol's valuation in the drink, so to speak, I wouldn't be surprised if one or more biopharmas step up with an offer soon with the hope of adding Opdivo to their own portfolio. Whether or not Bristol's management would entertain an offer is another matter, but a buyout bid could be the catalyst that rekindles the market's interest in this top pharma stock. Gilead Sciences, Inc.: 32 billion reasons to watch Cory Renauer (Gilead Sciences): I'll be watching this biotech stock closely this quarter for signs of another big acquisition. It's been just over five years since the company purchased Pharmasset and the compound that became the cornerstone of its hepatitis C franchise for $11.2 billion, which turned out to be one of the best biotech investments of all time.  The company finished 2016 with about $32.4 billion in cash and equivalents. That would be more than enough to bolster its budding oncology program with an acquisition of Tesaro, or even Incyte. It could also add to an already comprehensive attempt to develop the first approved treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with the purchase of Intercept Pharmaceuticals.  Despite having an enormous pile of cash to spend and a history of big acquisitions, Gilead is famous for its acquisitive discipline. Investors have been clamoring for more action on its M&A front, but management has been steadfast in its conviction that clinical-stage biotech assets are far too expensive right now. Unfortunately, a disparaging fourth-quarter earnings report could change its tune. Gilead recently upset investors by reporting 2016 sales fell 6.8% from the previous year, then forecasting another drop of at least 18.2% this year. Hepatitis C treatments that surged following their launches then subsided in the face of more recent competition, along with less urgent demand, are to blame. The answer to Gilead's woes, according to legions of investors and analysts, is another transformative acquisition. Keep your eyes peeled for signs it might finally be time. Playing the waiting game Keith Speights (Lexicon): Waiting on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is something biotechs get used to over time, but Lexicon Pharmaceuticals is having to wait a little longer than it hoped. The FDA was originally scheduled to announce a decision on approving Lexicon's carcinoid syndrome drug telotristat ethyl by Nov. 30, 2016. However, the agency needed more time and extended its review by three months. A decision on potential approval for the drug should be announced by February 28. My hunch is that Lexicon will get a green light from the FDA. Two late-stage studies showed that patients taking telotristat ethyl had significantly reduced daily bowel movements (the primary outcome measure of the studies) than did those on placebo. The drug's safety profile, at least at the lower 250 mg dose, appeared to be similar to that of a placebo. Some analysts think telotristat ethyl could reach peak annual sales of more than $500 million if the drug is approved. I suspect Lexicon's stock could be in for a big boost in a few weeks. However, there's always a chance that the FDA delivers disappointing news. Investors who don't want to take on significant risk might want to play the waiting game themselves.   Cory Renauer owns shares of Gilead Sciences.

But in India, billionaire software guru Bill Gates has basically been told to get the hell out the country now that he and his wife Melinda’s infamous foundation has been exposed as nothing more than a vaccine-pushing fraud directly tied to Big Pharma. India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) announced recently that it is officially cutting ties with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. This announcement comes after it was shown that so-called vaccine “campaigns” conducted on tens of thousands of young girls throughout India back in 2009-2010 that were meant to help protect them from cervical cancer were actually cloaked vaccine trials involving two highly controversial vaccines known to injure and kill. The vaccines in question are Cervarix by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Gardasil by Merck & Co., both of which are marketed as protecting against the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is claimed to have a link to cervical cancer. Both vaccines come with extreme side effects, and evidence shows that GSK and Merck essentially teamed up with the Gates Foundation to take advantage of young Indian girls and use them as human guinea pigs in trials of the two vaccines. According to independent journalists, these trials resulted in thousands of injuries and hundreds of deaths that were eventually traced back to the two vaccines. Once news of this got back to Indian authorities, an investigation was launched that landed the Gates Foundation in court for serious ethical violations. Economic and Political Weekly, which led the investigation, says that the Gates Foundation ban is unquestionably necessary due to “…the promotional practices of drug companies, pressure from powerful international organizations, and the co-option of, and uncritical endorsement by India’s medical associations are influencing the country’s public health priorities.” Bill Gates guilty of committing serious crimes against humanity? Backing these claims are several whistleblowers from the Indian non-governmental women’s organization Sama, which brought before authorities considerable evidence showing that young women were taken advantage of by Bill Gates and his cronies, who illegally injected dangerous vaccines into them without proper consent or even full disclosure as to what was being dispensed into their bodies. Besides receiving the dangerous vaccines, these same women were forced to submit copies of their fingerprints to government authorities, a coercive effort that only further indicts the Gates Foundation for human rights violations involving some of the most vulnerable members of the global population. “The Centre has shut the gate on the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on a critical national health mission, and possible conflict of interest issues arising from the foundation’s ‘ties’ with pharmaceutical companies is one of the reasons,” reports the Economic Times of India. “All financial ties of the country’s apex immunization advisory body, National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI), with the Gates Foundation have been cut off.” Because India’s national health program has not been completely infiltrated by vaccine-pushing, drug-hawking eugenicists like Bill and Melinda Gates, various arms of its sub-agencies were able to support this decision and make it a reality. It took five years of battling with India’s Supreme Court, but ultimately it was all worth it because, for once, the globalists have lost a major avenue for pushing their agenda of death and destruction. “We welcome this move by the government,” Ashwani Mahajan, a co-convener of the Swadeshi Jagaran Manch (SJM) platform that successfully eradicated this entity of “economic imperialism,” told Economic Times of India, who wants to see India continue to reject this type of foreign infiltration. “We have always said foreign influence in our domestic policies in any way must be avoided.” Sources: JeffereyJaxen.com EconomicTimes.IndiaTimes.com Previous :Climate Change supporters become “science fascism” enforcers: Michael Mann sues critics who question his tortured conclusions Next : Science paper attempts to claim all flu shots work, even if it’s the wrong strain… but actually admits vaccine-induced immunization is a farce Join the Health Ranger's FREE email newsletter Get breaking news alerts on GMOs, fluoride, superfoods, natural cures and more...

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 14 February 2017 by Military News Incyte Reports 2016 Fourth-Quarter and Year-End Financial Results, Provides 2017 Financial Guidance and Updates on Key Clinical Programs WILMINGTON, Del.–()–Incyte Corporation (Nasdaq:INCY) today reports 2016 fourth-quarter and year-end financial results, highlighting strong revenue growth driven by increased sales of Jakafi® (ruxolitinib) in the U.S. and Iclusig® (ponatinib) in Europe, and royalties from ex-U.S. sales of Jakavi® (ruxolitinib) by Novartis. Additionally, Incyte is providing financial guidance for 2017. “We have had a very productive year at Incyte, during which we expanded our geographic footprint to include Europe and further advanced our clinical portfolio, including the recently announced expansion of the epacadostat development program,” stated Hervé Hoppenot, Incyte’s Chief Executive Officer. “Having now surpassed $1 billion in total annual revenue for the first time, we believe we are in a strong position to execute on our discovery and development objectives and build a global biopharmaceutical company bringing medicines to patients in need.” Baricitinib, a potential new oral treatment for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) licensed to Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly), is now approved in Europe as Olumiant® and is under regulatory review globally. The European approval of Olumiant triggers a $65 million payment to Incyte from Lilly, and Incyte is eligible to receive additional potential milestone payments, as well as royalties on sales of Olumiant. Incyte has recently opted into co-development of multiple new indications for baricitinib, including psoriatic arthritis, in which Lilly is expected to begin a Phase 3 trial in 2017. Incyte continues to expand its development portfolio—the Company anticipates the initiation of new pivotal trials in at least six indications from its broad late-stage portfolio during 2017 and is conducting four Phase 2 trials which, if successful, could also potentially act as registration-enabling studies. Two recent strategic collaborations have added to Incyte’s early-stage R&D programs—the alliance with Merus provides access to bispecific drug discovery and the licensing agreement with Calithera adds INCB01158, a first-in-class oral arginase inhibitor, to Incyte’s immuno-oncology development portfolio. Portfolio Update Cancer – Targeted Therapies The pivotal program investigating ruxolitinib as a treatment for patients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) has begun. REACH1, the pivotal Phase 2 trial in patients with steroid-refractory acute GVHD, enrolled its first patient in December 2016; the REACH2 and REACH3 randomized Phase 3 trials in steroid-refractory acute and steroid-refractory chronic GVHD, respectively, are expected to begin in 2017 in collaboration with Novartis. A pivotal program of ruxolitinib as a treatment for patients with essential thrombocythemia is also expected to begin in 2017. Itacitinib (formerly INCB39110), Incyte’s selective JAK1 inhibitor, is anticipated to enter a global pivotal development program for the treatment of patients with treatment-naïve acute GVHD during 2017. In January 2017, Incyte disclosed its FGFR4 inhibitor discovery program, the lead molecule from which, INCB62079, is expected to enter proof-of-concept clinical trials during 2017.                     Indication     Status Update Ruxolitinib (JAK1/JAK2)     Steroid-refractory acute GVHD     Pivotal (REACH1) trial underway; Phase 3 (REACH2) trial expected to begin in 2017 Ruxolitinib (JAK1/JAK2) Steroid-refractory chronic GVHD Phase 3 (REACH3) trial expected to begin in 2017 Ruxolitinib (JAK1/JAK2) Essential thrombocythemia Pivotal program expected to begin in 2017 Itacitinib (JAK1) Treatment-naïve acute GVHD Pivotal program expected to begin in 2017 Itacitinib (JAK1) Non-small cell lung cancer Phase 1/2 in combination with osimertinib (EGFR) INCB52793 (JAK1) Advanced malignancies Phase 1/2 dose-escalation INCB50465 (PI3Kδ) Diffuse large B cell lymphoma Phase 2 (CITADEL-202) expected to begin in first half of 2017 INCB54828 (FGFR1/2/3) Bladder cancer, cholangiocarcinoma; 8p11 MPNs Phase 2 INCB54329 (BRD) Advanced malignancies Phase 1/2 dose-escalation INCB57643 (BRD) Advanced malignancies Phase 1/2 dose-escalation INCB53914 (PIM) Advanced malignancies Phase 1/2 dose-escalation INCB59872 (LSD1) Acute myeloid leukemia, small cell lung cancer Phase 1/2 dose-escalation INCB62079 (FGFR4)     Hepatocellular carcinoma     Phase 1/2 dose-escalation expected to begin in 2017   Cancer – Immune Therapies In January 2017, Incyte and Merck announced the decision to expand the clinical development program investigating epacadostat with pembrolizumab, and plan to initiate Phase 3 trials of the combination in four additional tumors beyond melanoma: non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. These Phase 3 trials are expected to begin in 2017. In January 2017, Incyte announced that it licensed worldwide rights from Calithera Biosciences to develop and commercialize INCB01158, a first-in-class, oral arginase inhibitor in hematology and oncology indications. In February 2017, Incyte and Agenus announced an amended agreement, converting the ongoing GITR and OX40 antibody programs from co-funded development and profit-sharing arrangements to royalty-bearing programs, with Incyte now responsible for global development and commercialization.                     Indication     Status Update Epacadostat (IDO1)     Unresectable or metastatic melanoma     Phase 3 (ECHO-301) in combination with pembrolizumab (PD-1) NSCLC, renal, bladder and head & neck cancer Phase 3 in combination with pembrolizumab (PD-1) expected to begin in 2017 Multiple tumor types Phase 2 (ECHO-202) expansion cohorts in combination with pembrolizumab (PD-1) Multiple tumor types Phase 2 (ECHO-204) expansion cohorts in combination with nivolumab (PD-1) Multiple tumor types Phase 2 (ECHO-203) expansion cohorts in combination with durvalumab (PD-L1) NSCLC, bladder cancer Phase 1/2 (ECHO-110) dose-escalation in combination with atezolizumab (PD-L1) INCB01158 (ARG, co-developed with Calithera) Solid tumors Phase 1/2 dose-escalation INCSHR1210 (PD-1, licensed from Hengrui) Solid tumors Phase 1/2 dose-escalation completed; enrollment suspended INCAGN1876 (GITR) Solid tumors Phase 1/2 dose-escalation INCAGN1949 (OX40) Solid tumors Phase 1/2 dose-escalation   PD-1 platform study Solid tumors Phase 1/2, pembrolizumab (PD-1) in combination with itacitinib (JAK1) or INCB50465 (PI3Kδ) JAK1 platform study     Solid tumors     Phase 1/2, itacitinib (JAK1) in combination with epacadostat (IDO1) or INCB50465 (PI3Kδ)   Non-oncology A Phase 2 trial of topical ruxolitinib for the treatment of patients with atopic dermatitis has recently been initiated, and a Phase 2 trial in patients with vitiligo is expected to begin during 2017.                     Indication     Status Update Topical ruxolitinib (JAK1/JAK2)     Alopecia areata, atopic dermatitis     Phase 2       Vitiligo     Phase 2 expected to begin in 2017   Partnered In February 2017, the European Commission approved baricitinib – which will be marketed as Olumiant – for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to, one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). In January 2017, the FDA extended the review period for the new drug application (NDA) for baricitinib by three months to allow time to review additional data analyses submitted by Lilly. Lilly has announced its intention to initiate a Phase 3 program investigating baricitinib as a treatment for patients with psoriatic arthritis during 2017, and Incyte has opted into co-development in this indication. Incyte has also opted into co-development in axial spondyloarthritis and atopic dermatitis, should Lilly decide to progress into a pivotal program in these indications. Novartis anticipates submitting an NDA for capmatinib, Incyte’s potent and selective c-MET inhibitor, in 2018.                     Indication     Status Update Baricitinib (JAK1/JAK2, licensed to Lilly)     Rheumatoid arthritis     Approved in Europe; FDA review extended by three months Psoriatic arthritis Phase 3 expected to begin in 2017 Atopic dermatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus Phase 2 Capmatinib (c-MET, licensed to Novartis)     Non-small cell lung cancer, liver cancer     Phase 2 in EGFR wild-type ALK negative NSCLC patients with c-MET amplification and mutation   2016 Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year Financial Results Revenues For the quarter ended December 31, 2016, net product revenues of Jakafi were $238 million as compared to $182 million for the same period in 2015, representing 30 percent growth.

A congressional hearing with company officials could be on the horizon. Shooting off a scathing letter rebuking a drugmaker's high prices is becoming routine in Washington. The latest was a letter sent by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., on Monday to Illinois-based Marathon Pharmaceuticals for the $89,000-a-year cost of a drug treating a rare pediatric disease. However, the public tar-and-feathering of the pharmaceutical industry has had a mixed result, depending on how big the company is, one expert said.

"To Big Pharma, it is having a significant impact because they are worried," said Gerard Anderson, health policy professor at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. Anderson said larger companies such as Pfizer and Merck are paying attention to the congressional concerns because of long-term impact to their brand and business through any new laws. The industry's biggest lobbying group, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, is running a major ad campaign this year to rehab its image. However, some major companies still raised prices year. An analysis from the Wall Street Journal found that in the first quarter of 2016 more than two-thirds of the biggest 20 drug companies used price increases to drive sales growth. Also from the Washington Examiner OMB director pick likely to be confirmed, but his battles have just begun Rep. Mick Mulvaney, a budget hawk, will have to face off with war hawks and other spenders. By Sarah Westwood • 02/16/17 12:01 AM Smaller companies have been responsible for some of the biggest price hikes highlighted by Congress. "A lot of these small companies that are trying to maximize their revenues right now don't take a long perspective and therefore are ignoring all of these letters," Anderson said. Those companies are more worried about the next quarter than whether their brand will survive public disdain, he added. One of the most infamous companies was a small biotech firm called Turing Pharmaceuticals, which ignited public furor by raising the price of the anti-malarial drug Daraprim by 5,000 percent. The former CEO, Martin Shkreli, grew in infamy by disregarding the criticism. This led to a contentious hearing with the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee where lawmakers attempted to query Shkreli about the price, but he refused to answer questions because of pending federal charges over unrelated trading practices.

By Eddie Scarry • 02/16/17 12:01 AM The latest victim of Washington ire is Marathon Pharmaceuticals, which received Food and Drug Administration approval last week for treating the rare pediatric disease Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. Reports showed that Marathon plans to charge $89,000 a year for Emflaxa, which is a steroid that is sold for about $1,000 a year overseas. While the drug has been approved overseas as a steroid, it received FDA approval for a new use under the orphan drug program. The program gives companies seven years of market exclusivity for a drug that treats rare diseases, an incentive for drugmakers to make products for under-served patient populations. On Monday, Sanders and Cummings sent a letter to Marathon demanding answers about the price. The letter resembles other missives sent to drugmakers over the past few years, asking for answers on research and development costs and any information on sales presentations. Last week, more than 30 Democrats wrote to Kaleo Pharmaceuticals demanding answers for charging $4,500 for an auto-injector of naloxone, an opioid overdose antidote. The drug cost $690 in 2014. Other price hikes that got attention from Congress include Valeant and Marathon raising the price by more than 500 percent of two older heart medications. Generic drugmaker Mylan also testified before Congress to explain the $600 price for a two-pack of the allergy drug EpiPen. The company afterward began offering a generic version for $300. Lawmakers also have started investigations into generic drugs overall and the high price of insulin. In addition, the House Oversight Committee and Senate Special Committee on Aging have held high-profile hearings excoriating pharmaceutical CEOs for the prices. Despite the letters, the outrage and the hearings, no major legislation has been introduced to address high drug prices, but that could change in this Congress. President Trump has criticized high prices before and has hinted at reforms such as giving Medicare the power to negotiate for lower drug prices and speeding up FDA approvals. Legislation has been introduced in the House to speed up approvals of generic drug, but no legislation has been introduced to give Medicare negotiating power. Several drug makers have adopted a practice of buying an older drug that has no competition and jacking up the price. Turing's 5,000 percent spike of Daraprim, which was a brand name drug on the market for decades but not protected by a patent, is one such example. Some advocates are in favor of spurring more innovation. "If we are serious about lowering drug costs, we have to make sure that incentives created to spur innovation are used for groundbreaking research instead of simply fleecing the American people," said Will Holley, spokesman for the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing. Top Story For GOP, another day in Trump whirlwind: Confusion, defiance, and a nagging fear I spent much of Wednesday talking and corresponding with Republicans in various states of anxiety about the latest revelations concerning the Trump campaign and Russia. Some put more credence in the allegations than others. All thought the leaks of national security intercepts behind the news stories were outrageous, and that the leakers should be punished. But even for those most inclined to support President Trump, there was still a nagging fear that the stories might be true. A former government official was the most alarmed. We talked in the morning, not long after he read the much-discussed New York Times story headlined, "Trump Aides Had Contact With Russian Intelligence.

Regulatory approval of crenezumab, gantenerumab, and notably ocrevus (ocrelizumab) could give the drug-maker approximately 15 percent of the market share within this forecast period. The author of the report, GBI analyst Qaisrah Khalid, wrote Ocrevus is expected to become a blockbuster drug within three years of its launch potentially generating $3.2 billion in sales becoming the primary force responsible for Roche’s growth.   Ocrevus is an investigational monoclonal antibody being tested as a treatment for relapse remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). The drug works by targeting CD20-positive B cells that are immune cells which are believed to play a key contributing role in nerve cell damage. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Ocrevus a priority review in June 2016 after clinical trial results indicated the six month intravenous injection was able to lower the risk of disability progression by 24 percent in PPMS patients.  Another study revealed Ocrevus provided better disease control for RRMS patients compared to Merck’s Rebif. A mix of clinical and MRI outcomes were used to test the efficacy of these drugs, but the trial achieved its endpoint when these RRMS patients exhibited no evidence of disease activity over the course of two years.    RRMS is the most common form of the disease characterized by clearly defined attacks of new or increasing neurologic symptoms followed by periods of partial or complete recovery. Approved treatments for this variation of the disorder include Copaxone, Tecfidera, and Lemtrada. Ocrevus could fill an important need for patients suffering from PPMS because the rarer but more debilitating form of this condition marked by steadily worsening symptoms has no approved therapy. However, Khalid’s analysis concludes noting Biogen will maintain its lead over this treatment space throughout the forecast period largely due to Tecfidera sales, which is not set for patent expiry until 2028 while another therapy Plegridy is predicted to reach blockbuster status sometime in the next five years. The FDA is scheduled to make a decision on Ocrevus in March 2017. The European Medicines Agency will conduct its review of the drug in the third quarter of this year too.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 February 2017 by Military News Competitive Landscape for Worldwide Bone Marrow Transplant Market by Segments – 2024 Albany, NY — — 02/15/2017 — Global Bone Marrow Transplant Market Bone marrow is a type of human tissue found within bones. It constitutes less than 5% of the human body by mass. However, it is a crucial part of the human circulatory and immune systems, as it produces red blood cells and lymphocytes. Hence, diseases of the bone marrow or affecting the bone marrow can be fatal. Bone marrow transplant is a procedure utilized in extreme cases of bone marrow diseases and skin and bone cancer. A transplant is the last resort in such cases, as bone marrow is required for proper functioning of the body. However, the increasing prevalence of conditions that require a complete bone marrow transplant has driven the global market for the same in the last few years. The most common diseases that require bone marrow transplant include leukemia, thalassemia, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and anemia. Download Complete Healthcare Analytical Brochure: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=11237 Global Bone Marrow Transplant Market: Drivers Increasing incidence of blood cancer is a primary driver of the global bone marrow transplant market. Aided by lifestyle factors such as the rising prevalence of smoking of alcohol consumption, sedentary lifestyles, and unhealthy diets, the prevalence of cancers, particularly blood cancers, has increased in the last few decades. This has driven the bone marrow transplant market, as malfunctioning bone marrow can be extremely harmful to the body. By disease type, leukemia is the major contributor to the global bone marrow transplant market. The infrastructure required to carry out bone marrow transplant procedures has also expanded in the last few decades. Increasing research into the biological and logistical factors of storing and using donated bone marrow has made the process smoother and easier. This has led to higher patient confidence and, consequently, improved market performance. Intensive research in bone marrow transplant has made the process more reliable, thereby increasing the prognosis of the patient significantly. This has also driven patient confidence in the procedure, which in turn is driving the global market. Global Bone Marrow Transplant Market: Restraints High cost of bone marrow transplant is a major restraint of the global bone marrow transplant market. The process is highly sophisticated and requires constant monitoring and post-operative care. Hence, it costs more than what the average consumer, even in developed countries, can pay. Increasing demand is likely to help the bone marrow transplant market overcome this restraint. The adverse impact of this factor on the bone marrow transplant market is exacerbated by the lack of reimbursement options for the treatment. Lack of bone marrow donors is another major factor restraining the global bone marrow transplant market. Less awareness about the procedure in the developing countries has resulted in shortage of bone marrow donors. Global Bone Marrow Transplant Market: Geographical Overview Europe dominated the global bone marrow transplant market. The region is home to some of the world’s most extensively distributed and advanced health care systems, with several countries offering excellent public facilities. This has allowed the region’s health care players to add bone marrow transplant to their portfolios. Europe is expected to continue to dominate the global bone marrow transplant market in the next few years. However, the bone marrow transplant market in North America is showing promising signs of growth. Major companies providing bone marrow transplant equipment are Lonza Group Ltd., Sanofi-Aventis LLC, STEMCELL Technologies, Merck Millipore Corp., and AllCells LLC.

Stainton | February 15, 2017 Tax credits for 'angel investors' are key to encouraging private investment in new and growing companies A record number of biotechnology, life sciences and other tech-related companies with a presence in New Jersey stand to benefit from private investments spurred in part by tax credits approved by state officials last year — a sign the Garden State continues to serve as the nation’s medicine chest. The New Jersey Economic Development Authority announced Tuesday it has approved 251 applications from “angel investors” who are eligible for state income-tax credits to help offset the more than $96 million in private funding they funneled to Garden State tech firms during 2016 — the highest annual total since the program launched three years ago. Nearly four-fifths of these applications were OK’d in the last quarter alone, according to the EDA, which uses tax credits, loans, bond sales, and other public financing mechanisms to help businesses and nonprofits grow in New Jersey. The Angel Investor Tax Credit Program, which also requires sign-off from the state Division of Taxation, is designed to encourage private investment in new and growing tech companies of all kinds. Approved applicants can receive credits equal to as much as 10 percent of their investment in firms that conduct research, manufacture products, or work to commercialize new technology in New Jersey. (The companies can be based elsewhere, as long as they have a real footprint here.) Garden State an ideal location for biotech Biotech leaders said the Garden State is an ideal location for their growth, given the experienced and well educated pool of employees, the location and easy access to New York and Philadelphia, and funding opportunities — both public and private. One example is Taxis Pharmaceuticals, a Monmouth Junction-based company now working on an antibiotic designed to treat MRSA, a highly resistant bacterial infection, based on technology developed at Rutgers University. Taxis benefitted from a number of private investments in 2015 and another in 2016 that involved the EDA’s tax credit program. Gregory Mario, president and CEO, Taxis Pharmaceuticals, Monmouth Junction Taxis president and CEO Gregory Mario said at a conference in September hosted by BioNJ, an industry advocacy group, that New Jersey’s advantages included a strong labor pool, “some of the greatest scientists in the world,” and other top-tier pharmaceutical companies ripe for collaboration. He also praised “the very healthy relationship between public and private entities,” including academic institutions like Rutgers and state agencies like the EDA, “which has been instrumental in our ability to incubate our young technology.” While New Jersey has long been home to pharmaceutical giants like Merck & Co. and Johnson & Johnson, the larger biotech sector — which explores how living organisms can benefit medicine, agriculture, industry, and other technologies — has grown from 50 to nearly 400 companies statewide, according to a study by BioNJ. The industry directly employs more than 212,000 people in the state, and also supports thousands of service companies based here. “The expertise you need to develop a drug is in New Jersey,” Pamela Demain, a former Merck executive, said at the BioNJ conference. Some lawmakers say state should do more to help the industry Despite this reputation, some lawmakers insist the state should do more to build biotech-related business. A task force to promote the industry was formed in the 1990s but the former Commission on Science and Technology, which provided grants to start-up firms, has not been funded since then Gov. Jon S. Corzine eliminated its budget in 2010. Gov. Chris Christie signed a bill to create a nine-member New Jersey Biotechnology Task Force in August, but it is not clear if any members have yet been appointed to fill these posts. Al Altomari, president and CEO of Agile Therapeutics, Princeton In the meantime, interest in the EDA program appears to have skyrocketed. Since 2013, the EDA has approved 673 applications that helped investors channel $220 million into 51 tech and life sciences companies. (Most companies benefit from multiple investments offset by these tax credits.) The credits available for investors range from just over $1,000 to $500,000; state officials were still calculating on Tuesday the total value redeemed. Investors can apply the credits to personal or business income tax payments; if they don’t live in the state, or don’t owe tax, they could be eligible for a refund. Another benefactor of the program, Agile Therapeutics of Princeton, focuses on female contraception. The company received two investments in 2014 that triggered tax credits, including one for $425,000 — one of the highest ever awarded by the EDA. “Our roots are in New Jersey,” said Agile president and CEO Al Altomari, explaining that their work grew out of research at Rutgers University. “New Jersey is a great place for us to recruit talent, to be close to investors, to be close to the thought leaders and have virtually everything we need for our organization,” he said.

Gilead Sciences' discouraging forward outlook has plenty of investors running for the exits. Here’s why I took another step in the opposite direction. Cory Renauer (TMFang4apples) Feb 14, 2017 at 8:22AM Like most of you, I don't like to lose money. So you might be wondering why I was so quick to scoop up more shares of Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) stock after its latest earnings report. After all, management shared a forecast for 2017 hepatitis C antiviral sales 39% lower than 2016 figures, and that's at the high end of the provided range. Before you assume I've completely lost my marbles, consider a few important points: The stock is cheap, the company is highly profitable, and it looks positioned to remain so for the long term. Read on for a closer look at the reasons this biotech stock is a terrific bargain with market-beating potential written all over it. Image source: Gilead Sciences. How cheap? Before we look forward, let's try to get a sense of just how cheap Gilead Sciences stock is right now. At recent prices, its shares can be purchased for just 5.8 times 2016 earnings. For comparison, the average stock in the benchmark S&P 500 index is currently trading at 24.2 times trailing earnings. A big reason the stock is trading at such a low P/E ratio has to do with fear of losses going forward. Indeed, management guided 2017 total product sales to fall from $29.95 billion last year to between $22.5 billion and $24.5 billion this year. Despite the expected losses, the stock is trading at just 8.2 times this year's earnings estimates. Generally, single-digit P/E ratios during years-long bull markets suggest heavy losses ahead. You might be surprised to learn the average Wall Street analyst covering Gilead Sciences expects earnings to contract at an annual rate of just 6.5% over the next five years. A shrinking bottom line over the long term is hardly something to get excited about, but 6.5% per year isn't really that bad, considering the stock's recent price. If Gilead's bottom line fell at that rate, in 2021 the company would report GAAP earnings of about $7.11 per share, making its forward PE still just under 10. Soft landing ahead If you're concerned contracting sales of Gilead's hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatments are going to get much worse, you might find these figures reassuring: U.S. HCV treatment initiations. Image source: Gilead Sciences. The introduction of new drug classes is generally associated with a spike in new patients. In a sense, Gilead Sciences is a victim of its own success. The company rushed Sovaldi and Harvoni through the regulatory process at breakneck speed to get its treatment out ahead of the competition. It benefited from HCV patient warehousing ahead of its approval and immense pricing power while it was the only highly effective new treatment option available. With the introduction of Viekira Pak from AbbVie and Zepatier from Merck & Co., its pricing power subsided. Also, a higher percentage of patients in earlier stages of the disease have been beginning treatment. Since these patients are often treatable with shorter regimens, per patient costs have fallen as well. Market entrants might have given end payers some leverage to negotiate lower prices, but they didn't dig very far into Gilead's share of the U.S. HCV space. An estimated 205,000 of 231,000 HCV treatment initiations last year included Sovaldi's active ingredient. HCV treatment initiations including Sovaldi (in thousands). Image source: Gilead Sciences. In 2014, there were an estimated 180.6 million people worldwide living with HCV infections. Treatment initiations might taper off a bit further, but this isn't a virus in close to complete eradication in my lifetime. Bright spots Although its incredibly successful HCV treatments get most of the attention, Gilead also has a large share of the hepatitis B and HIV spaces. Last November, the company earned FDA approval for its next-generation hepatitis B virus treatment, Vemlidy. Hepatitis B threatens the lives of about 2.2 million Americans, and Velmidy's improved safety profile over that of Viread (an older Gilead drug) should help it become a popular treatment option for this population. In HIV, Gilead's recently approved single pill treatment option, Odefsey, is quickly gaining popularity due to a lower dosage requirement, which makes it far easier to tolerate than previous offerings. Since earning FDA approval last March, sales of the drug have steadily marched upwards to $155 million in the fourth quarter, a 48% gain over the previous three month period. In the same vein, sales of its more recently launched HIV treatment, Descovy, jumped 69% over the previous quarter to $149 million during the last three months of 2016. Image source: Getty Images. Further ahead, Gilead has arguably the most vibrant program to develop the first treatment for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a potentially fatal condition that leads to hardening of the liver and affects about 12 million Americans. Towards the end of the year, you can expect some data from a couple mid-stage clinical trials with two separate NASH candidates. Next year, the company expects late-stage data from a third NASH candidate, which generated some encouraging data in a smaller study. Management has suggested effective treatment of NASH will require a multi-pronged approach. If its candidates fit the bill, Gilead could launch another multi-billion blockbuster combination in the years ahead. At the bargain bin price I just paid for my shares, I'll probably come out ahead in the long run even if the company can't catch lightning in a bottle for the third time.

Amgen previously won an injunction that would have forced Praluent off the market leaving Amgen's Repatha (evolocumab) the only approved PCSK9 inhibitor on the market. Then, recently an appeals court panel stayed the injunction, giving Sanofi time to appeal the lower court ruling. This may be the first teleconference by pharmaceutical company attorneys with reporters over patent litigation, so it was very unusual. John Conway, vice president, global head of Sanofi's Intellectual Property Department, said, unsurprisingly, that Sanofi is "very pleased with the stay of the injunction ... It was the right decision. And, of course, it really means that we are able to keep our very important drug Praluent on the market because in all of this we were very concerned about the injunction taking away access ... to patients who need it ... The court decision really shows that they took a deliberate measure of our position ... It is our long-standing position that the Amgen patents are invalid." Chan Lee, North American general counsel for Sanofi, cited three specific areas relating to the case: The "unprecedented nature of the district court ruling." Lee said, "From my perspective, this [Praluent] is the first innovator biopharmaceutical product that would have been withdrawn solely for patent reasons ... I've seen references to human growth hormone and pegylated EPO products as products blocked for patent reasons in the past, but they are not good analogies for this case. In my view, those were follow-on biologics before the biosimilar pathway was established. Unlike HGH and EPO, alirocumab is a completely different molecule than evolocumab and has established safety and efficacy through its own rigorous trials." Why Sanofi "firmly believes" the Amgen patent is not valid. Lee said, "Certainly, from a pure patent perspective, we believe that the patent in question lacks written description and lacks enablement. From a policy perspective, we believe this patent is overly broad and would stifle innovation." Lee cited the example of statins -- the pioneer in that field, Merck, never asserted broad rights over the entire class. As a result, a variety of other statins were introduced to patients' ultimate benefit. Differences in the two PCSK9 inhibitors and the "continuing emerging science." Lee said, "The two molecules [alirocumab and evolocumab] are entirely different. They have different product profiles, different dosing regimens. The two molecules have different approaches on LDL management: Praluent's approach is to manage LDL to goal; Repatha, at a high level, its approach is to manage LDL to a maximum lowering effect." Another Sanofi executive laid out the paths that the still-active litigation could take, which could include taking the dispute to the Supreme Court and/or retrial at the district court level. Asked if Sanofi is negotiating a settlement with Amgen, Conway said no. 2017-02-11T16:00:00-0500 0 comments More in Cardiology New Calculator IDs Minimal-Risk Stable Angina Patients Systolic BP Predicts Later CVD in Blacks CVD Burden in U.S. Expanding Faster Than Expected ICD Shocks Set Off Cascade of Healthcare Usage About Help Center Site Map Terms of Use Privacy Policy Advertise with us Your Ad Choices The material on this site is for informational purposes only, and is not a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis or treatment provided by a qualified health care provider. © 2017 MedPage Today, LLC.

Human papillomavirus, or HPV, is the most common sexually transmitted disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which along with the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the three-dose (over a period of six months) vaccine at that age, meaning before kids generally become sexually active. More than 25 speakers — including doctors, researchers, executives from health-care foundations, high school students, cancer survivors and even a dentist — addressed Dr. Karen Hacker, head of the Allegheny County Health Department, and council members. Dr. Liz Miller, director of community health at Children's Hospital at Pittsburgh and a professor of pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh's School of Medicine, called the vaccine mandate "critically important" for "bridging the gap" in parts of Allegheny County where parents might not be educated on HPV, or where access to primary care is less likely. "The HPV vaccine is frankly a no-brainer," she said. According to the CDC, in most cases HPV will go away on its own. But when it doesn't, it can cause genital warts and cancers, including cervical cancer, cancer of the vulva, vagina, penis or anus. Cancer caused by HPV can also manifest itself in the throat, tongue and tonsils. Currently the vaccine is mandatory for school entry in Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington, D.C. "We have spoken with all three states to better understand their perspectives and experience," Hacker wrote in an email to City Paper. She says the vaccine is covered by most health-insurance plans and is included in the Affordable Care Act's preventive measures. John Rhodes, a 50-year-old assistant basketball coach for the Duquesne University Dukes, testified as a throat- and neck-cancer survivor. He called himself a "6-foot-9 walking billboard" for the HPV vaccine. He has been in remission for seven months after being treated for stage-four cancer that settled in his lymph nodes and was caused by HPV.  "My kids are vaccinated," he said. "As a coach and a competitive person, I challenge you [to mandate the vaccine]." Several doctors shared concern for the pain and complications their patients feel once they are diagnosed with a cancer caused by HPV. Dr. Umamaheswar Duvvuri, a head- and neck-cancer surgeon at UPMC and the local VA hospital, told the crowd about his 55-year-old male patient from Dubois, Pa., who found a lump on his neck. "I spent the day removing a large portion of this man's tongue," he said. "That could've been prevented." After the meeting, he explained that he and colleagues will be operating on six patients and treating four others for "oropharyngeal" cancers — head and neck cancers — and that those types of cancers are predicted to rise by 2020. Sixteen-year-old Sydney Reyes, of Riverview Junior-Senior High School, addressed another common argument against the vaccine — that it will encourage sexual promiscuity in teenagers. "This assumption can be resolved by having a proper discussion with your teen, not by blocking a vaccination," Reyes said. "Why should we risk a life like this when we really don't have to?" A few speakers against the vaccine mandate expressed their concerns to the councilors. A parent named Amy Rafferty read a letter from a friend whose daughter allegedly suffered severe hypertonia — muscles spasms — to the point where she couldn't walk anymore after receiving Gardasil, the HPV vaccine from Merck. James Lyons-Weiler, who formerly worked at the Hillman Cancer Center and who started his own research group entitled the "Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge," told the crowd he was concerned that the current vaccine would allow for stronger virus strains to attack humans in the future. Yesterday, Lyons-Weiler posted a 3,000-word essay on his blog denouncing the medical professionals who asked Allegheny County to mandate the vaccine. He also mentioned that he met Rafferty because she organized the local screening of VAXXED — an anti-vaccine documentary that was kicked off the Tribeca Film Festival schedule, and which City Paper's film critic Al Hoff said came "across as an infomercial by way of a conspiracy theory for a discredited argument." Speakers who followed opponents of the vaccine mandate contradicted their arguments. Hacker says the comments gathered at the hearing will be presented to the board of health in July. "They wanted us to consider what the public felt [about an HPV-vaccine mandate]," Hacker said by phone today.  If the board decides to recommend a mandate, a public-comment period would follow. Editor's note: This post has been udpated to include comments from Dr. Karen Hacker.

The market size for cancer immunotherapies is expected to grow more than fourfold from $16.9 billion in 2015 to $75.8 billion by 2022, representing a rapid compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.9%. The imbalance between early-stage and late-stage product development is more pronounced than typically seen in the industry, and may suggest greater difficulty than normal in developing cancer immunotherapies. However, these findings may also indicate a substantial drive to invest in early-stage cancer immunotherapy development, which could eventually filter through to late-stage product development. According to the research, several late-stage pipeline drugs, as well as some already marketed drugs, are expected to achieve blockbuster status by the end of the forecast period, while a number of existing blockbuster therapies are forecast to experience strong revenue growth. Established immunotherapies, particularly Revlimid, Opdivo, Keytruda and Gazyva, are set to witness rapid sales growth throughout the forecast period, with Keytruda and Opdivo rising by $7 billion and $9 billion, respectively. Revlimid will experience similar levels of growth, driven by label expansions covering oncology indications, including multiple forms of leukemia and lymphoma. The cancer immunotherapies market already consists of some commercially successful products. - Which classes of drug dominate the market? - What additional benefits have newly approved therapies brought to the market?

These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. Note that this randomized trial found a two-drug anti-retroviral regimen to be non-inferior to a 3- or 4-drug regimen among patients with HIV infection with a completely suppressed viral load. Be aware that this combination is not yet approved for this indication. SEATTLE – Patients diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who have successfully suppressed serum virus to undetectable levels on multidrug antiretroviral therapy appear to be able to switch to a more convenient two-drug regimen without sacrificing efficacy, researchers reported here. Of the 513 patients who were switched from a three- or four-drug regimen, 95% maintained virus at undetectable levels using the 50 cells/m3 assay compared with 96% of 511 patients who remained on their original treatment regimen after 48 weeks, said Josep Llibre, MD, PhD, of University Hospital Germans Trias, Badalona, Spain. "A dolutegravir [Tivicay] plus rilpivirine [Edurant] two-drug combination offers the potential for reduction in cumulative antiretroviral exposure, without an increased risk of virologic failure," Llibre told MedPage Today at a press briefing at the annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. Llibre said the trial demonstrated that dolutegravir plus rilpivirine was non-inferior to the comparator three- or four-drug regimens. The findings were the same whether the patients were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis or on a per-protocol basis. Overall, virologic failure occurred in three patients – less than 1% – on the two-drug regimen, and in six patients (1%) of the patients who remained on their current antiretroviral regimen. Analysis of the virus in the patients who experienced virologic failure did not reveal any resistance to the integrase inhibitor; one patient had a resistant mutation to rilpivirine, the researchers reported. "It has been a long-term dream to find [a way to] reduce the number of drugs taken by patients who face lifelong treatment of HIV," Llibre said. He said that the researchers selected the integrase inhibitor dolutegravir and the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor rilpivirine because the drugs were safe, effective and had high barriers that prevented HIV from becoming resistant to the agents. The most commonly reported adverse events in the dolutegravir and rilpivirine arm were nasopharyngitis, headache, diarrhea, and upper respiratory tract infection. For the comparator arm, the most commonly reported adverse events were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, back pain, headache, and diarrhea. The studies are ongoing for 148 weeks. Llibre reported that 27 patients in the dolutegravir plus rilpivirine arm of the study experienced serious adverse events, four of which were believed to be treatment-related. There were 21 serious adverse events in the current antiretroviral regimen patients, but only one was considered treatment-related. He said the researchers did not observe any new adverse events with the two-drug combination. Patients in the two open-label trials, dubbed SWORD-1 and SWORD-2, were recruited into the study if they had been diagnosed with HIV and had undetectable viral loads for at least 12 months. The patients were eligible for the switch if they did not also have infection with hepatitis B and if they had remained suppressed with no history of virologic failure. The median duration of antiretroviral treatment was just over four years at the time of entry into the studies. Joseph Eron, MD, of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, told MedPage Today that the population selected for the SWORD trials was similar to the patients he sees. "Most of the our patients maintain suppression of virus for long periods. There are relatively few patients who are co-infected with hepatitis B – about 5% of the population," Eron said. Use of dolutegravir and rilpivirine as a two-drug regimen for HIV-1 maintenance therapy is investigational and not approved anywhere in the world, Llibre noted. He said that the SWORD trials did not indicate that the regimen could be used in patients as first-line therapy or in patients who did not have a suppressed viral load. The SWORD trials represent a combined effort of drug companies ViiV healthcare and Janssen. Kimberly Smith, MD, vice president and head of global research for ViiV Healthcare, told MedPage Today that the firms are testing a combination tablet for pharmacokinetics and then will submit an application for approval with the FDA later this year. The study was sponsored by ViiV and Janssen. Llibre disclosed relevant relationships with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead Sciences, Janssen-Cilag, Merck Sharp & Dohme, and ViiV. Smith is an employee of ViiV. Eron disclosed relevant relationships with AbbVie Inc.; Gilead Sciences, Inc.; GlaxoSmithKline; Janssen Pharmaceuticals; Merck & Co., Inc.; Tibotec, Inc.; Tobira Therapeutics; ViiV Healthcare and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.

Share article on Facebookshare Tweet articletweet Plus one article on Google Plus+1 Print Article Adjust font size AA AA AA AA AA AA AA by Jim Geraghty February 14, 2017 9:36 AM From the Tuesday edition of the Morning Jolt: New Jersey Democrats: We Pledge To Punish Your Employer! One of the most fascinating things to watch in the coming four years will be New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker’s rapid, not-so-convincing transformation from a Wall-Street-friendly, quasi-moderate “new ideas” Democrat into the taller, better-looking Bernie Sanders. I remember a reporter from a mainstream publication who had covered Booker for a long while, coming to an increasingly cynical perspective about him. This was a few years ago, so I’m paraphrasing, but the gist was, “you watch Booker go out to Silicon Valley and see him speak about finding new solutions as mayor and connecting with as many people as possible and school choice and technology, and you walk away really excited. You think, ‘wow, that guy could be the next big thing.’ And then you see him go to these other audiences… and it’s always the same thing. This reporter concluded that Booker was less The Next Big Thing and more a carefully-calibrated, contrived image covering the usual political ambitions and willingness to move on from difficult problems. Anyway, it appears “I won’t be a squish like that Cory Booker guy” is turning into a theme in the New Jersey Democratic gubernatorial primary. Assemblyman John Wisniewski took his gubernatorial campaign to South Jersey today, criticizing fellow Democrat Cory Booker for joining Senate Republicans to vote down an amendment sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders that would have allowed Americans to purchase cheaper prescription drugs from Canada. “That vote against it was about protecting the pharmaceutical industry,” said Wisniewski, who served as chairman of Sanders’ presidential campaign in New Jersey campaign chairman, told a forum in Evesham sponsored by Our Revolution New Jersey, a grass roots group whose genesis was Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign. Wisniewski pledged to put pressure on New Jersey-based drug manufacturers “on day one,” if he is elected Governor. Easy there, chief. Pharmaceutical companies aren’t quite the same powerhouse of the New Jersey economy that they used to be, but they’re still a big, big employer. It’s the country’s third biggest hub for drug-makers and the state’s biggest private sector employers include Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Bristol-Meyers Squibb, Novartis, and Bayer. According to state figures, the pharmaceutical industry employs 47,850 people, which may not sound like a lot but the average salaries are comparably huge: $145,620 in 2015. But if New Jersey Democrats want to campaign on a pledge to stop “protecting” and start “putting pressure” on the state’s biggest employers… go right ahead, guys. The Corner The one and only.
