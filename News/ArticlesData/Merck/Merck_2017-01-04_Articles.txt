The 37-year-old Otsego native was diagnosed with stage 4 high grade pleomorphic sarcoma in March. What started as severe back pain spread cancer from her spine to her hips, right femur and several ribs. Now it is encroaching on her heart. Even in her darkest moments, Volker finds a way to stay positive. Five excruciating rounds of chemotherapy were unsuccessful, however a new FDA-approved therapy could be her best hope for treatment. Though both her oncologists supported the drug, known as Keytruda, Volker was told she couldn't receive it until her insurance provider denied the trial three separate times. Each denial would take several weeks -- time she might not have to spend waiting. In order to circumvent the barriers in place through her insurance, Volker and a wellspring of hometown supporters campaigned directly to Merck, the New Jersey-based pharmaceutical company that makes Keytruda. Otsego residents had rallied behind Volker throughout her fight with cancer, hosting fundraisers and awareness events, creating videos and sharing her story through social media. When they heard of the drug, many posted directly on Merck's Facebook page, flooding it with appeals for help. On New Year's Day, the Merck's vice president and head of oncology called. The company is now working with Volker to streamline the process for her to receive Keytruda treatments. Edwina Hoonhorst, Volker's childhood friend and a South Carolina nurse, said her friend's struggle to find alternative treatment highlights a larger issue facing cancer patients. "The red tape that a patient has to go through to get what they need is outrageous," she said. "Since the beginning I've told Lorie (and her sister) Abby, 'if you know it's right in your gut, fight for it. Make sure you get what you need.' If there are trials out there that are available, but not to the masses, why do you have to go to the extreme route that we did to save someone's life?" Keytruda is a relatively new treatment method. Instead of attacking cancer cells directly, it attempts to stop cancer cells from evading T-cells that hunt them. Basically, the drug would help Volker's immune system do what it's designed for; find and kill cancer cells. Merck clinical trials found Keytruda reduced the risk of progression or death by 50 percent compared to chemotherapy, reducing the risk of death by 40 percent. "It's so unfortunate that a patient can't say they would like to try (other options); they force you to go through chemo when other versions of treatment are available," Volker said. "To have them (say) you have a few months left, but to get through the red tape it probably won't happen ... needless to say it's very frustrating." The treatment would make life dramatically more comfortable for Volker. She said chemotherapy for sarcoma in the bone is one of the most painful treatments available. "It leaves you close to the brink of death," she said. One regimen required her to stay at the hospital for 50 hours a week, leaving her unable to move for the following two weeks. Another made her brain bleed, causing hallucinations. Doctors had to stop the treatment to prevent lasting neurological damage. "I haven't had any relief from chemo since I started," Volker said. "It's like being so sick with the flu that you can't even open your eyes, otherwise the room will spin. (At times) I've not even able to hold down a sip of water." Volker is known by her nickname "Honey Badger," named after the relentless mammal. She is a marine safety officer for the Macomb County Sheriff's Office and continues to work as strategic manager of global accounts for Office Depot from her bed. Hoonhorst said Volker has showed off her toughness but also handled her situation with grace, uplifting and inspiring her loved ones. Her boyfriend John stays by her side and has rarely missed an appointment. On Facebook, Volker was always the "dork" urging her friends to perform random acts of kindness for strangers. Now, she's been on receiving end. "I'm this girl from a tiny town that no one known of, but we had several thousands of people look at our videos and had this giant pharmaceutical company call; It's crazy," she said. "Everyone just wants to help, we've received donations from people who I have never met." A GoFundMe account set up by Hoonhorst has raised $15,500 from 144 people in nine months. Throughout the day she shares short videos with her son, Braylen. She gave her only son a telescope for Christmas, and taught him to find his loved ones among the stars. Already a woman of strong faith, Volker's spirituality deepened during her bouts with chemotherapy. "My heart has been so warmed by seeing the goodness of people," she said. "Usually people see so much darkness in a disease but it has been beautiful for me."   Detroit Auto Show Relive top vehicle unveilings 2017 Detroit auto show unique technology and oddities The most overlooked vehicles at the Detroit auto show Technology steals show, but is 'mobility fatigue' setting in?

(NYSE:MRK) was awarded $2.54 in royalty damages in a case involving one of the  most popular available treatments for combating the hepatitis C virus (HCV). A federal jury decided that Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), an American biotech firm headquartered in Foster City, CA, owed these royalties as a result of its infringement of patents for HCV treatments held by Merck’s Cambridge, MA-based subsidiary Idenix Pharmaceuticals. According to coverage of the verdict by Bloomberg, this $2.54 billion royalties award is the largest verdict for patent infringement in the history of the United States. The case was decided by jury in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (D. Del.). According to background information listed in the original complaint filed by Idenix in D. Del. back in December 2013, Gilead’s infringement activities date back to at least April 2013 when the company submitted a new drug application (NDA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an HCV treatment including sofosbuvir. Sofosbuvir is a pharmaceutical agent which exhibits higher cure rates, less side effects and a reduced duration of treatment against multiple genotypes of HCV, improving upon conventional treatments for the disease. Gilead markets an HCV treatment named Sovaldi which contains sofosbuvir in combination with the antiviral agent ribavirin. Sofosbuvir is also a component of Harvoni, another HCV treatment marketed by Gilead. In December 2013, the FDA awarded the breakthrough therapy designation to Sovaldi, fast-tracking the approval process used to get the treatment into the U.S. pharmaceutical market. Since that time, Sovaldi has been a major money earner for Gilead. Through 2014, Gilead earned a reported $10.3 billion in revenues for sales of the HCV medication, trailing 2014’s top pharmaceutical earner Humira, an autoimmune disease treatment marketed by American firm AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), by a little more than $2 billion. That difference in revenues, however, is almost completely eliminated when including Gilead’s $2.1 billion 2014 revenues for sales of Harvoni. Sovaldi and Harvoni sales were down a bit throughout 2015’s fourth quarter but they still combined to produce $2.37 billion in revenues during that quarter. Idenix’s initial complaint alleged that Gilead’s sales of HCV treatments containing sofosbuvir infringed upon its IP asset U.S. Patent No. 7608600, titled Modified 2’ and 3’-Nucleoside Prodrugs for Treating Flaviviridae Infections. It claims a method of treating a host infected with HCV by administering to the host a medication in tablet or capsule form which contains hydrogen, an amino acid ester and then a base comprised of a specific amino acid like thymine or adenine. The application for the ‘600 patent had a priority date going back to June 2002, and the patent itself was granted in October 2009. The treatment was developed to combat HCV, which had reached epidemic levels worldwide, along with other flaviviridae diseases like dengue fever and yellow fever while exhibiting low toxicity in human hosts. Gilead does have its own patents in the HCV treatment space but Merck alleged that Gilead’s related IP interferes with the ‘600 patent held by Idenix. Gilead holds U.S. Patent No. 8415332, titled Modified Fluorinated Nucleoside Analogues. This patent discloses a method of inhibiting the proliferation of HCV in a human subject by providing an antivirally-effective amount of a compound which is administered in combination or alternation with an antiviral, antibacterial or anticancer treatment. This patent also references the worldwide HCV epidemic and the need for low toxicity medications for the disease. The application for the ‘332 patent was first filed in September 2010 by Pharmasset, an HCV treatment developer which was purchased in 2011 by Gilead for a reported $11 billion in cash. Although the ‘600 patent was only U.S. patent which was asserted by Idenix and Merck initially in this case, four additional Idenix patents were eventually asserted in the case. According to IP blog Patently-O, these include: U.S. Patent No. 6914054, titled Methods and Compositions for Treating Hepatitis C Virus. It protects a method of treating HCV in a human patient similar to that described in the ‘600 patent which uses new pharmaceutical agents providing low toxicity in a host. U.S. Patent No. 7105499, titled Nucleoside Derivatives as Inhibitors of RNA-Dependent RNA Viral Polymerase. It discloses a method of treating HCV in a mammal by administering nucleoside derivatives which are useful as inhibitors of HCV replication. U.S. Patent No. 7608597, same title as ‘054 patent. It discloses a method of treating HCV infection by administering an effective amount of a purine or pyrimidine ß-D-2’-methyl-ribofuranosyl nucleoside, or a phosphate thereof. U.S. Patent No. 8481712, same title as ‘499 patent. It claims a compound which works as an inhibitor of HCV polymerase to suppress RNA-dependent RNA viral replication. According to the jury verdict form, also provided online by Patently-O, Idenix was able to prove that reasonable royalties consist of 10 percent of the sale of Gilead’s infringing treatments. This led to the $2.54 billion verdict as the total dollar value of Sovaldi sales and adjusted sales of Harvoni through August 2016 was found to be $25.4 billion. This largest patent infringement verdict in U.S. history has an opportunity to be tripled, however, as the jury also found that Gilead had engaged in willful infringement of Idenix’s ‘597 patent. The jury’s verdict also upheld the ‘597 against challenges of invalidity which were brought by Gilead. Gilead did not prove that ‘597’s specification did not enable the asserted claims or that the specification does not contain an adequate written description of the asserted claims. Gilead also didn’t prove either that four claims of the ‘597 patent were invalid for anticipation or that 15 claims of the ‘597 patent were invalid based on obviousness to one skilled in the art. This case could see further life as both Bloomberg and Reuters have reported that Gilead plans to file an appeal of the verdict. Idenix has also sought to enforce its patents in the European market, having filed multiple patent infringement suits against Gilead in March 2014. However, in December 2014, a court in the United Kingdom invalidated Idenix’s European patent asserted in the case, finding that the patent lacked novelty over previously published patent applications for similar compounds which were filed by Gilead.

The acquisition opens growth opportunities for Merck in the food and beverage space; particularly in the U.S. Confidentiality has been agreed on the financial details of the transaction. Photo - http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/453215/Merck_BioControl.jpg BioControl's established rapid detection technology and third-party validated testing platforms complement Merck's portfolio of instruments and consumables in its applied solutions business geared to the food pathogen testing workflow. "BioControl's acquisition strengthens our ability to help customers protect the global food supply by providing an expansive portfolio of state-of-the-art testing technology," said Udit Batra, Member of the Merck Executive Board and CEO, Life Science business. "BioControl's innovative assays and validated kits, when combined with Merck's strengths in microbiology, filtration and e-commerce will create a strong global provider aimed at solving tough challenges in the food pathogen testing space," he added. The global spotlight on the importance of food safety has grown given the increased incidents of outbreaks and recalls with foodborne diseases often caused by consuming a wide range of foods including undercooked meat, eggs, fresh produce and dairy products contaminated by Salmonella, Listeria, E.coli O157H7 and Campylobacter. BioControl's product portfolio includes pathogen detection kits to identify these food poisoning bacteria in food and ingredients and its key customers include meat producers. "Merck is the best home for BioControl, our customers and our employees," said Phil Feldsine, President and Chief Executive of BioControl. "Merck's global market presence as a leader in laboratory sciences will introduce BioControl's innovative, customer oriented solutions to a much broader base worldwide while providing existing customers with access to Merck's food safety product portfolio and expertise.  The opportunity for BioControl to become part of a world class 350-year-old organization with a reputation for doing it the right way is very rewarding." The acquisition is in line with the strategy of Merck's life science business to expand in key geographies, and provide a differentiated experience to customers in applied settings, including food and beverage safety testing. While the business will continue to focus on microbial quality control solutions for pharmaceutical production processes and products, an area where the business currently has leading market share, the acquisition will enable Merck to offer a complete food pathogen testing platform to its customers in the food and beverage safety testing market. Achelous Partners acted as financial advisor to BioControl on this transaction. Nixon Peabody LLP represented Merck in the transaction.

The two have newly entered a licensing partnership under which MSD will take charge of selling Hanmi’s Rosuzet across 23 countries, excluding Korea. Hanmi said it could not specify the given countries due to contract stipulations. Hanmi Pharmaceutical's Rosuzet (Hanmi Pharmaceutical) Rosuzet is a dual-action drug combining two active ingredients -- ezetimibe and rosuvastatin. It treats hyperlipidemia, a chronic illness caused by an overabundance of lipids, such as fats, cholesterol and triglycerides, in the blood. Under the partnership, Hanmi will take charge of developing and producing Rosuzet while MSD will carry out the drug’s marketing and sales in the 23 countries. It is the second time for Hanmi and MSD to co-promote a product developed by the Korean drug company. In 2009, the two signed a partnership for the global launch of Hanmi’s hypertension treatment Amosartan, also known as Cozaar XQ, which combines amlodipine with losartan. “Under the partnership, Hanmi will be able to successfully launch Rosuzet in global markets by utilizing MSD’s global sales and marketing networks,” said Hanmi Pharmaceutical CEO Lee Kwan-sun. “We plan to continue engaging in additional talks over expanding our partnership to include more countries,” Lee said. Having kicked off 2017 with a new partnership announcement, Hanmi Pharmaceutical apologized for its mishaps in 2016, including delaying key disclosures on sensitive licensing deals that caused the company’s share price to plunge and prompted a legal investigation. “We deeply apologize for our shortcomings in 2016 and pledge to emerge as a more trustworthy pharmaceutical company this year,” Hanmi said in a recent statement. In September last year, the Korean drugmaker was heavily criticized for belatedly making a disclosure that Boehringer Ingelheim had terminated its license partnership with Hanmi over a new lung cancer treatment. Hanmi’s share price also took a steep fall in December when it announced the reduction of a licensing partnership it had entered with Sanofi over a set of new long-acting diabetes treatments. Hanmi said it is determined to regain public trust and make efforts to ensure that the remainder of the drugs it has licensed out global pharmaceutical companies can reach commercialization.

By Leslie P. Norton Biography November 12, 2011 Ten years ago, onetime Olympic sailor Mark Holowesko left his job overseeing Templeton's enormous growth and foreign funds to start his own shop in Nassau. Since then, Holowesko Partners, with $2.1 billion in assets, has racked up an enviable long-term track record in the Holowesko Global fund, a long-short hedge fund, and the Holowesko Global Equity fund, a long-only fund. Franklin Templeton remains a large investor, with 20% of Holowesko's company; he still sits on some Templeton boards. An agile investor, he believes it's "a wonderful time to be investing in equities." To learn where Holowesko, 51 years old, has put his money, keep reading. Barron's: You're a value investor. Isn't everybody? Holowesko: I hate these labels, to be quite honest with you. If you can buy future growth at a discount, to me, that's value. But you could argue it is a growth style. I don't consider myself a value investor. I consider myself a sensible investor who tries to look at where the discounts are, and not necessarily just low price/earnings ratios or low price-to-book. I am more than happy to pay for future growth. One of my stocks is Mead Johnson Nutrition mjn -0.2833262501770789% Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. U.S.: NYSE USD70.39 -0.2 -0.2833262501770789% /Date(1484344923433-0600)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 1423243 AFTER HOURS USD70.39 % Volume (Delayed 15m) : 21671 P/E Ratio 26.16728624535316 Market Cap 13002652364.2133 Dividend Yield 2.3440829663304448% Rev. per Employee 497141 More quote details and news » mjn in Your Value Your Change Short position (ticker: MJN), which trades at 24 times earnings. I think that is relatively cheap, discounting future growth back to today's earnings. Enlarge Image Close "The one thing that gives us a great deal of comfort is the substantial amount of free cash flow being generated by companies." Ben Jamieson for Barron's More than anything else, we look at a firm as if we were going to buy the whole business. We try to break that down for each unit of a company. We try to understand exactly what we're paying per acre of timberland, for example. We do a lot of work on the balance sheet to understand the liability we assume for firms. We understand our downside better than most value investors, who think that they are protected because they are buying an asset at a discount. An example, please? For every name we invest in, we have a net downside price target. Back in '08-'09, I went to 90% net long, because the downside of my average stock was at 5%, the lowest it's been since I've been in this business. For my first job at Templeton, John Templeton wanted me to quantify the Bhopal [India] disaster and the liability impact for Union Carbide. BP (BP) was in a similar situation during the Gulf disaster. The issue wasn't whether they had problems, it was to quantify the downside. Today, in Europe, we obviously have problems with sovereign debt for Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Ireland. HSBC Holdings (HBC) has exposure to those markets. What is that exposure? How much has been written down? If it's written down another 50%, what is the impact on its balance sheet? It is about 8% of their equity. That is completely different from most of the U.K. and French banks. It is being pushed down relative to most other banks. We think the concerns are misplaced. We spend as much time on the downside and try to understand how much money we can lose as we do how much money we can make. Most value investors don't do top-down work. You have to do it if you're in the energy sector; for example, you have to have a view of oil prices. And obviously, if you're investing in foreign countries and take a foreign-currency position, you have to have a view of the currency. Obviously, we have to evaluate financial conditions in Europe to get a level of comfort about buying different stocks there. So what is your top-down work telling you about the economy and markets? Most of my top-down work is sectoral, looking at trends for companies. If I look at [the power- and automation-engineering firm] ABB (ABB) for example, I have to have an assumption about where global capital-expenditure is going. They are assuming 6% growth in capex globally. Is that reasonable for their markets? It is, based on the fact that they're in certain geographic regions and markets where capex will increase. That's more meaningful than whether the Chinese government is being too restrictive in terms of lending, or whether Europe will go back into recession in the next six months. Our assumptions are for low to negative growth in Europe in the next six to 12 months, with wage pressure in Spain and Italy, and ongoing debt concerns. The biggest issue is currency risk. In the case of the euro, we have it hedged. The one thing that gives us a great deal of comfort is the substantial amount of free cash flow being generated by companies. There are only so many things you can do with excess cash. It can build on balance sheets, you can pay down debt, you can increase capex, you can grow dividends, or you can repurchase shares. That takes a lot of risk out of what we are doing. It is a wonderful time to be investing in equities—whether you take a growth approach or a value approach—so long as it is sensible. People are still fearful of equities, and are basically looking at risk in the markets as opposed to evaluating the underlying fundamentals of balance sheets, cash flows, valuations. Valuations are as cheap or cheaper, on an enterprise value-to-sales basis, than they were back at the bottom of the market in '09. That is something people aren't paying attention to. Holowesko's Picks... Recent Company Ticker Price Exxon Mobil XOM $78.70 ABB ABB $18.10 Tod's TOD.Italy €69.95 Bridgestone 5108.Japan ¥1772 And a Pan Charter Comm CHTR $52.69 Source: Bloomberg On a P/E basis, valuations don't seem so hot. Earnings look wobbly. P/E is a very simplistic assumption, and people tend to look at the "E" on a very short-term basis. I would agree that P/E is too high for most companies today. At Templeton, we looked at earnings over a full business cycle and discounted [them] back to today's price, and adjusted the price for dividends to see if it looked cheap. That is useful when the market is offering growth at a discount, and that is not where the value is today. Today, the biggest story is free cash flow. Tell us how good the free cash flows look, and how we can make money. One of my favorite themes is that companies are in much better shape than governments and consumers. Companies are so global in nature that, despite two of the worst recessions in history, they have done well in generating revenues and earnings and cash flow. This cash is building substantially on balance sheets. Just to give you an idea, take net cash surplus—the amount of cash we expect a company to have available at year's end in excess of what it needs to run its business.

Marry that with companies growing dividends for 20 years, and you'd get them as well. In fact, stocks today are at an enterprise value as cheap as they were in the early '80s. I'm incredibly comfortable about "taking risk" in the market. Let's have some of the names you're particularly fond of. ExxonMobil trades at some of its lowest valuations in decades, relative to price-to-free cash flow, relative dividend yields. It's done massive share-repurchases. It's bought back 47% of its market value over the past 10 years. If the $20 billion it uses in 2011 for share repurchases were used for dividends instead, then the current yield of 2.5% to 3% would be more like 8.5% to 9%. Since 1980, the barrel-of-oil-equivalent of reserves has gone from $2 to $5 per share. This is incredibly cheap, with oil at $94. It has $380 billion of enterprise value. The amount of reserves you are buying keeps going up. Just on proven reserves, not probable and possible, you are buying a barrel of oil at $15. It's a great example of a large-cap blue chip with very strong returns, and a balance sheet that has very little downside over the long run. The stock is at around $70 ,and our target is roughly $100. I also like ABB. They have been able to grow revenue at 7% annually for the last five years—more than two times gross-domestic-product growth. They've been growing earnings 18%, because they've been reducing costs. They returned $5 billion to stockholders, and made $7 billion of acquisitions over the last five years, but still have net cash. They have a growing backlog of orders, 50% of them from emerging markets. The stock trades at 12 times earnings, and has a 4% yield, which is covered by net cash and which I anticipate they will grow. The stock is at 16 Swiss francs [about $17.50 U.S. dollars]; our target is $23. What else? A smaller name is Tod's tod.mi 1.600609756097561% Tod's S.p.A.

They're phenomenal. The stock is down 30% since mid-July. In the first half, they grew revenue 16%, and net income at 26%. That's going to slow, because Italy is 50% of revenue. Revenue growth will probably go to 8%, from 16%, and net income growth will slow to 12% to 15%, from 26%. It trades at nine times cash flow. For most brands like this, cash flow is the most important thing. Most global brands trade at 12 times to 15 times. They're underpenetrated in the U.S. and in Asia, but those markets are growing quite rapidly. Despite the Chinese slowdown? There is still huge appetite there. Asia and the emerging markets are massive for them. Shoes are 75% of revenue, but they are growing in other products. This company trades [at] 12 times earnings, if you strip cash out. It has returns on capital of the high teens to the low 20s. It will have 200 million euros [$272 million] in cash by the end of next year, on a market cap of 2.5 billion euros. It pays a 3% yield. The stock price of €69 should be closer to €85 to €90. How about in Asia? Bridgestone 5108.to 0.4718290313627533% Bridgestone Corp.

It trades at one times book, versus a global average of two times book. It has a free cash flow yield of 7% to 8%. It trades at five times Ebitda [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization], versus its long-term average of seven times. EV-to-sales is 0.6, versus a long-term average that's closer to one. There's a massive replacement cycle in tires coming in China. Between 2001 and 2009, the auto market in China grew 26% a year, and your typical tire has a three-year life. About 60% of Chinese car owners have yet to change a tire. Why would they replace it with a Bridgestone and not a homegrown tire? They are incredibly brand-conscious, and Bridgestone is very competitive. They manufacture all over the place—in Hungary, Poland, Mexico, in Huizhou, China and Wuxi, China. They also have facilities in Thailand. The stock has underperformed, because people are worried about input prices, particularly rubber. Once you plant a rubber tree, you have to let it mature for five to seven years, and the peak yield occurs five years after that. Then, after 25 years, you have to rip them out and plant them again. A massive planting of trees occurred between '04 and '08. Though rubber prices are high, they are probably going to come down quite a lot. You have an incredibly cheap stock, and input prices that are probably going to decline. How do you play emerging markets, particularly China?

Skip to content Military Technologies pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 January 20175 January 2017 by Global Veterinary/Animal Vaccines Market Key Trends & Forecast 2024 The global market for veterinary vaccines features an exceedingly consolidated competitive and vendor landscape, with the top three companies, namely Zoetis, Inc., Merck & Co., and Sanofi Aventis, collectively accounting for nearly half the market in 2015, observes a recent report by Transparency Market Research. The vast funds required for research and development in the field of vaccines have made it possible for a small number of small-scale companies to gain a stronghold in the global market. In 2015, small-scale companies accounted for a mere 30% of the overall market. Transparency Market Research predicts that the global veterinary vaccines market will exhibit a nearly 7% CAGR from 2016 through 2024 and rise from US$6,271.8 mn in 2015 to US$11,403.6 mn by 2024. Live Attenuated Vaccines to Continue to Dominate Global Sales In terms of vaccine technology, the segments of live attenuated and inactivated vaccines collectively accounted for a share of nearly 80% in the global veterinary vaccines market. Used largely for companion animals, live attenuated vaccines individually held a nearly 44% of the overall market in 2015. These vaccines are produced in bulk owing to low cost of production. Over the report’s forecast period, the live attenuated vaccines technologies will continue to remain the dominant contributor to the revenue of the global veterinary vaccines market. Request a PDF Brochure with Report Analysis: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag… In terms of animal type, the segment of canine vaccines accounted for the dominant 52.7% of the global market in 2015. The segment is expected to exhibit a remarkable 8.6% CAGR from 2016 through 2024 and retain its dominant position in the global market. Geographically, North America led the market in 2015, accounting for a more than 44% of the global market. Increased uptake of Animal Protein in Developing Economies Key to Market Growth Animal products such as pork, beef, milk, chicken, and eggs contribute nearly 40% to the GDPs of agrarian economies. The market for these livestock-source foods generated revenues worth US$600 bn in 2015 and their demand is expected to expand at a significant pace across the globe in the next few years, especially across developing economies due to rising disposable incomes and increased focus on nutrition and healthcare. China, for instance, accounts for over half of the world’s total swine meat consumed on an annual basis. As the demand for animal-source food products increases, the focus on animal health and wellness will rise across the globe and will subsequently lead to a significant rise in the demand for veterinary vaccines. Stringent Approval Policies and Short Exclusivity Periods to Arrest Market Growth Product exclusivity periods of spans as short as three to five years are one of the key challenges faced by companies operating in the animal health care industry. The veterinary vaccines market also bears the brunt of this issue and the inevitable introduction of generics and over-the-counter products post patent expiration mars the profitability of companies who have spent vast funds on R&D to develop a new vaccine. Apart from this, the overall growth prospects of the global veterinary vaccines market are also hampered due to the high dependence of market players on government channels for distribution. In India, for instance, the central and state governments purchase foot and mouth disease vaccines in bulk and supply them in different parts of the country. Bulk purchases often translate into reduced profits for the manufacturers and hamper the profitability of the entire global veterinary vaccines market. This review of the market is based on a recent market research report by Transparency Market Research, titled “Veterinary Vaccines Market (Animal Type – Companion Animals (Equine, Canine, and Feline) and Livestock Animals (Bovine, Ovine, Porcine, and Poultry); Technology Type – Inactivated Vaccines, Live Attenuated Vaccines, Conjugate Vaccines, and Toxoid Vaccines) – Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2016–2024.” Browse Full Research Report on Veterinary Vaccines Market: www.transparencymarketresearch.com/veterinary-vaccines-ma… About Us Transparency Market Research (TMR) is a market intelligence company, providing global business information reports and services.

Jim Cramer rang the lightning round bell, which means he gave his take on caller favorite stocks at rapid speed: Advanced Micro Devices: "I don't think anyone knows something other than the fact that the company is doing much better than people think. It does have a kind of difficult agreement that may cause some profit taking because it has to share some profit. But I will tell you that AMD is back and I think it can still go higher." Merck: "Merck I think is a hold. I believe in the work that Ken Frazier [CEO] is doing and I would not sell the stock. Don't forget it also yields 3 percent." Kimberly-Clark: "It's down because ... it is not a Trump stock. Why? Because it doesn't do better with a stronger economy. That said, I am never going to tell someone to sell the stock of Kimberly-Clark. A great American company, just a few points forward from its low, with a 3 percent yield. If anything, I say buy more." Crown Castle International: "I think that wireless towers is terrific, but I always tell people that AMT and SBAC are the better ones and I'm going to stick by that, particularly with American Tower." Costco Wholesale: "We are going to get some numbers from Costco. It's probably going to get hit. My club members say that no, I think Costco is a play on the membership card price going up. Tomorrow we might get that buying opportunity." Sonoco Products: "Stop looking, start buying! That is a company that I have liked since 1989 when my father did some work for them. It's a terrific packaging company." Questions for Cramer? Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC Want to take a deep dive into Cramer's world? Hit him up!

The former partners will now separately pursue vaccine development strategies for European patients, integrating their respective pipeline pursuits and products from the venture into their primary vaccines portfolios. After over 20 years of business, the break-up came in the wake of poor growth, with Sanofi Pasteur MSD only bringing in sales of €824m in 2015 - less than a fifth of Sanofi's year-end vaccines sales of €4.7bn. Each firm has a number of promising projects in the pipeline, with Sanofi and its vaccines unit Sanofi Pasteur focusing on vaccines for yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis and dengue virus. The French company also began research for a potential Zika vaccine in February last year. Meanwhile, Merck & Co (known as MSD outside of North America) is expected to launch its Ebola vaccine this year after a phase III trial of 4,000 patients saw 100% efficacy after a single dose. World Health Organization vaccines specialist Marie Paule Kieny said that the trial results were a “game-changer” for patients and for fighting future outbreaks of the virus. In a joint statement, Sanofi and Merck said: “We are proud of Sanofi Pasteur MSD's successful 20-year history. “Our joint venture has achieved considerable success over the past two decades from a public health and commercial perspective. “We believe that focusing our efforts on opportunities unique to our respective companies will better position us to drive growth, execute in a more efficient manner and optimise vaccine coverage.” Please enable JavaScript to view the comments.

The acquisition opens growth opportunities for MilliporeSigma in the food and beverage space, particularly in the U.S. Confidentiality has been agreed on the financial details of the transaction. BioControl's established rapid detection technology and third-party validated testing platforms complement MilliporeSigma's portfolio of instruments and consumables in its applied solutions business geared to the food pathogen testing workflow. "BioControl's acquisition strengthens our ability to help customers protect the global food supply by providing an expansive portfolio of state-of-the-art testing technology," said Udit Batra, Member of the Executive Board of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany and CEO, MilliporeSigma. "BioControl's innovative assays and validated kits, when combined with MilliporeSigma's strengths in microbiology, filtration and e-commerce will create a strong global provider aimed at solving tough challenges in the food pathogen testing space." The global spotlight on the importance of food safety has grown given the increased incidents of outbreaks and recalls with foodborne diseases often caused by consuming a wide range of foods including undercooked meat, eggs, fresh produce and dairy products contaminated by Salmonella, Listeria, E.coli O157H7 and Campylobacter. BioControl's product portfolio includes pathogen detection kits to identify these food poisoning bacteria in food and ingredients and its key customers include meat producers. "MilliporeSigma is the best home for Biocontrol, our customers and our employees," said Phil Feldsine, President and Chief Executive of BioControl. "MilliporeSigma's global market presence as a leader in laboratory sciences will introduce BioControl's innovative, customer oriented solutions to a much broader base worldwide while providing existing customers with access to MilliporeSigma's food safety product portfolio and expertise. The opportunity for BioControl to become part of a world class 350-year-old organization with a reputation for doing it the right way is very rewarding." The acquisition is in line with MilliporeSigma's strategy to expand in key geographies and provide a differentiated experience to customers in applied settings, including food and beverage safety testing. While the business will continue to focus on microbial quality control solutions for pharmaceutical production processes and products, an area where the business currently has leading market share, the acquisition will enable MilliporeSigma to offer a complete food pathogen testing platform to its customers in the food and beverage safety testing market. Achelous Partners acted as financial advisor to BioControl on this transaction. Nixon Peabody LLP represented MilliporeSigma in the transaction.

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States How a Slimmer Procter & Gamble Might Fare in 2017 By Paul Ausick January 5, 2017 8:10 am EST Print Email Tweet The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed out 2016 at 19,762.60 on December 30. It may not have hit the elusive 20,000 mark, but it ended the year with a gain of 13.4% from the 17,425.03 close on the last trading day of 2015. This was quite close to the 24/7 Wall St. forecast of 19,700, but we still have a case that can be made for up to Dow 22,000 late in 2017. The S&P 500 closed the year at 2,238.83, up 9.5% from the 2,043.94 close of 2015. The Nasdaq closed at 5,383.12, for a gain of just 7.5% from the 5,007.41 close at the end of 2015. Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) has been right-sizing its number of brands in a restructuring and divesting process, but this defensive consumer products giant generated a return of 9.4% and ended the year at $84.08 a share. It has a consensus analyst price target of $90.72, and the 7.9% in implied upside would generate an implied total return of 11.1% if you include the 3.2% dividend yield. P&G closed out 2016 in a virtual tie with Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) for the last spot on our list of the Dogs of the Dow. Back in the third quarter of 2016, hedge funds paid $8.9 billion to boost their holdings of P&G stock. The stock was hedge funds’ top purchase in the third quarter. As a group, the hedgies’ consumer staples purchases totaled $12.2 billion in the quarter, likely as a position hedging against volatility ahead of the November elections. In October, P&G transferred its specialty beauty products business to Coty Inc. (NYSE: COTY). A slimmer portfolio is expected to pay off for investors as the company now focuses on 10 product categories where it has about 65 category-leading brands. For P&G’s 2016 fiscal year ended last June, the company was able to reduce costs by 11% year over year to help overcome a strong dollar and drive earnings per share higher by 7% compared with fiscal 2015. The company is one of the Dividend Aristocrats, stocks that have raised dividends every year for at least 25 years. In fact, it has paid a dividend every year since its incorporation in 1890. The company is the very definition of a defensive stock. Procter & Gamble has a 52-week trading range of $74.46 to $90.33 and a market cap of over $225 billion. Its dividend yield is 3.2%.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search Health Care Was The Only Major Sector With Negative Returns Last Year January 5, 2017 7:18am NYSE:XLV ShareTweet From David Fabian: When looking over the last decade of sector returns on a year-by-year basis, it’s rare to see health care fall to the bottom of the stack. Yet that unusual event is exactly what occurred in calendar year 2016. Over the last twelve month, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) posted a total return of -2.76%. That final performance includes dividends and carries the stigma of being the only major S&P sector to finish the year in negative territory. To put things in perspective, energy stocks gained 28% in total return over the same time frame. XLV is the largest exchange-traded fund in the health care sector with $13.5 billion dedicated to a basket of 62 large-cap stocks. Top holdings include well-known names such as Johnson & Johnson Inc (JNJ), Pfizer Inc (PFE), and Merck & Co Inc (MRK). Companies focused on biotechnology research, pharmaceutical development, health care provider, and equipment services are all represented in XLV through a market-cap weighted asset allocation. A look at the chart below shows the meandering path that this ETF has taken over the last year. It now stands 8% below its prior 52-week high and has frequently jostled above and below its long-term 200-day moving average. The picture becomes even more bifurcated at the industry level. The iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology ETF (IBB) lost more than -21% in 2016 and continues to whipsaw in a violent sideways range. Furthermore, pharmaceutical companies have frequently been in the spotlight as a divisive issue over the course of the presidential election cycle. This negative sentiment has taken a toll on the PowerShares Dynamic Pharmaceuticals Portfolio (PJP), which is currently off -28% from its all-time high. Investors evaluating the future for healthcare stocks are likely to see one of two distinct paths. Momentum and trend following advocates will probably shy away from the weak relative performance and lack of attractive technical cues. Those who favor this style are likely to be drawn towards alternative sectors that are continuing to move in lockstep with the broader market or show a definable trading edge to higher prices. On the flip side, many will see the weak one-off year as the potential for an undervalued area of the market to make a significant comeback. Several large-cap health care stocks offer attractive fundamentals and this group may be an unlikely candidate for a bounce on any type of sector rotation events in 2017. ETF investors who own broad-based factor strategies that target volatility, momentum, or value would be wise to understand the impact of this sector on their holdings as well. Many smart beta funds will be rebalancing their holdings in January based on prior performance or relative valuation metrics. That may increase or decrease your health care exposure based on the rules-based criteria of each index. From a benchmark perspective, health care is the third largest component of the S&P 500 Index with a 13.6% asset allocation share. The size advantage means this sector has the potential to make a big impact on the market overall alongside individual investor portfolios. The Bottom Line The dispersion of individual sector returns in any given year is always an interesting study in market dynamics. These trends are typically driven by asset flows, investor narratives, or global economic forces. How you ultimately interpret the data and apply it towards your own portfolio is where the greatest impact will be had. Health Care SPDR (ETF) (NYSE:XLV) was unchanged in premarket trading Thursday. Year-to-date, XLV has gained 2.10%, versus a 1.36% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. XLV currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of B (Buy), and is ranked #6 of 36 ETFs in the Health & Biotech ETFs category. This article is brought to you courtesy of FMD Capital.

(MRK) Stock Is Defying the Bears! MRK stock gives bulls an early 2017 trading signal By Serge Berger, Head Trader & Strategist, The Steady Trader  |  Jan 4, 2017, 7:51 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: How Will Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock React to Q4 Earnings? Donald Trump Puts Humana Inc (HUM) Stock on My Buy Radar How to Trade Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL) Stock AFTER Earnings Recent Posts: How Will Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock React to Q4 Earnings? Donald Trump Puts Humana Inc (HUM) Stock on My Buy Radar How to Trade Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock After Earnings View All Posts The first trading day of 2017 was a mixed session. Although the broader indices ended higher on the day, underneath the surface, things traded in a sloppy fashion. Healthcare stocks lead the bounce, however, and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in particular caught my eye. See, healthcare stocks struggled in 2016’s second half, at least in part due to regulatory concerns around where a new U.S. administration will come down on them. Donald Trump’s victory seemed to bring a little more clarity to the picture, though that didn’t last for long. But on Tuesday, MRK stock bounced off a technically important level — plus, shares look ripe for additional buying pressure. Before digging into the charts of Merck stock, let me reiterate that the first two trading weeks of January (basically through Jan. 15) typically exhibit some of the most volatile price action, and with a downward bias. As such, while what I’m about to present is a valid trade idea, in the name of risk management, I think it would be prudent to trade with reduced size and well-defined stop-losses in place. Merck next reports earnings on Feb. 2, which given the potential regulatory overhang may only be marginally important as to the stock’s intermediate-term direction. Still, for MRK stock, this is a date to circle. MRK Stock Charts First, let’s look at the multiyear weekly chart. Click to Enlarge We can see here that despite the sharp rally off the 2009 financial crisis lows, MRK stock over the past couple of years has continued to struggle overcoming the $60-$65 area (blue band on the chart) on a sustainable basis. However, through this lens, the stock’s choppy sideways action over the past couple of years could also be looked at as constructive consolidation, which ultimately should resolve the stock higher. Note that despite a couple of years of sideways price action from this perspective, MRK stock has managed to hold its 2009 support lines intact.

The global osteoporosis drugs market is witnessing significant growth due to rising geriatric population and changing lifestyles impinging bone health. Prevalence of osteoporosis is high among people aged 60 years and above. Moreover, increasing the prevalence of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, growing awareness about osteoporotic care, and increasing investment in drug discovery and development are also driving the growth of the market. However, there are various side effects and complications associated with osteoporosis drugs such as heartburn, irritable bowel syndrome, nausea, and ulcers in the stomach or esophagus. Furthermore, patent expiration of osteoporosis drugs also inhibits the growth of the market.The osteoporosis drugs market is anticipated to grow from an estimated US$11,226.1 Mn by the end of 2015 to account for US$14,786.7 Mn by 2022 at a CAGR of 4.0% during the forecast period. In North America, the prevalence of osteoporosis is high primarily due to increasing geriatric population, growing obesity, and rising prevalence of lifestyle associated diseases in the region. According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation, in 2013, approximately 54 million people in the U.S. aged 50 years and above were affected by osteoporosis and low bone mass. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in the U.S., approximately 250,000 hip fractures are associated with osteoporosis. In Europe, increasing aging population, changing lifestyles, and increasing consumer awareness about osteoporosis care are driving the growth of the osteoporosis drug market. According to the International Osteoporosis Foundation, approximately 5.5 million men and 22 million women suffered from osteoporosis in 2010. Moreover, according to International Osteoporosis Foundation, approximately 27.5 million people in Europe suffered from osteoporosis in 2010 and the number is expected to reach 33.9 Mn by 2030. However, the growth of osteoporosis market in Asia Pacific is much due to rising geriatric population and changing lifestyles in the region. Osteoporotic patients have a higher risk of hip fractures, owing to a major cause of morbidity and mortality. According to the International Osteoporosis Foundation, by 2050, approximately 50% of the world’s osteoporosis hip fractures would occur in women in Asia. In addition, according to a study on Epidemiology in Osteoporosis in Japan by the National Centre for Biotechnology Information, in 2011, approximately 15 million people suffered from osteoporosis in Japan.

Health care stocks, which struggled for most of last year, climbed. Energy companies, banks, and technology companies made some of the largest gains; lower-risk investments like utility stocks lagged. That’s a sign investors expect stronger economic growth. ‘‘Corporate earnings are telling us that it’s a bull market,’’ said Karyn Cavanaugh of Voya Investment Strategies. Drug maker Merck rose 2.2 percent, while Amgen picked up 3.1 percent, and drug distributor McKesson gained 5 percent. The S&P 500’s health care index fell 4 percent last year as the S&P 500 itself rose 9.5 percent. Investors avoided drug company stocks as they worried the government will intervene to reduce prices. But Cavanaugh said the stocks are appealing because they’ve been reporting better growth than most. Elsewhere, Xerox surged 19.8 percent after it split in two, a move announced almost a year ago. Xerox will be the printer and copier business; Conduent will focus on business process outsourcing, payment processing, and other services. Conduent stock lost 7.9 percent Tuesday. Oil prices finished lower, with US crude down 2.6 percent to $52.33 a barrel. Yet energy companies traded higher. The manufacturing sector continued to recover and ended 2016 on a strong note. The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index rose to 54.7 in December, its highest reading of the year, in the fourth straight month of expansion. Loading comments...

(AP Photo/Richard Drew)) Specialist Meric Greenbaum, left, works at his post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Tuesday, Jan. 3, 2017. The stock market opened the year on a strong note, led by big gains in banks and energy companies. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (8) New York • U.S. stocks broke a three-day losing streak Tuesday and ushered in the new year with broad gains. Health care stocks, which struggled for most of last year, climbed. Stocks started the day with a surge as the Dow Jones industrial average rose 175 points in the first hour of trading. Bond yields jumped, which took bank stocks higher. The price of oil also rose early on, but it began slipping after 10 a.m. Investors started buying again late in the day, however, and major indexes closed with a flourish. Energy companies, banks and technology companies made some of the largest gains and lower-risk investments like utility companies lagged the rest of the market. That's a sign investors expect stronger economic growth that will help those companies do more business. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "Corporate earnings are telling us that it's a bull market," said Karyn Cavanaugh of Voya Investment Strategies. Cavanaugh said earnings and revenues look "very good" for 2017. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 119.16 points, or 0.6 percent, to 19,881.76. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 19 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,257.83. The Nasdaq composite gained 45.97 points, or 0.9 percent, to 5,429.08. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks small-company stocks, added 8.36 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,365.49. The Russell rose almost 20 percent last year and did far better than indexes focused on larger companies. Drug companies helped take health care stocks higher. Merck rose $1.28, or 2.2 percent, to $60.15. Biotech giant Amgen picked up $4.52, or 3.1 percent, to $150.73 and prescription drug distributor McKesson gained $6.98, or 5 percent, to $147.43. The S&P 500's health care index fell 4 percent last year. The S&P 500 itself rose 9.5 percent for the year and all of its other industrial sectors rose at least a small amount. Investors have been avoiding drug company stocks because they're worried the government will intervene to reduce prices. But Cavanaugh said the stocks are appealing because they've been reporting better growth than most other industries. "If you look at earnings and revenues, they're one of the leaders," she said. Xerox surged $1.14, or 19.8 percent, to $6.89 after it split itself in two, a move the company announced almost a year ago. The original Xerox kept its printer and copier business. The second company will focus on business process outsourcing, providing payment processing and other services. Xerox will receive $1.8 billion in cash. The new company, Conduent, now trades under the ticker symbol "CNDT." That stock lost $1.18, or 7.9 percent, to $13.72. Oil prices jumped in early trading but turned around to finish lower. U.S. crude gave up $1.39, or 2.6 percent, to $52.33 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, skidded $1.35, or 2.4 percent, to $55.47 a barrel in London. Despite that slump, energy companies traded higher. But natural gas companies dropped as natural gas futures dropped 40 cents, or 10.7 percent, to $3.33 per 1,000 cubic feet. Southwestern Energy lost 85 cents, or 7.9 percent, to $9.97 and Cabot Oil & Gas gave up $1.02, or 4.4 percent, to $22.34. The manufacturing sector continued to recover and ended 2016 on a strong note. The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index rose to 54.7 in December, its highest reading of the year. That was the fourth straight month of expansion and the ninth out of the last 10. The result was a bit stronger than analysts expected. Graphics processor maker Nvidia couldn't break out of a recent slump. The stock more than tripled in value last year, but hit a wall in the final days of trading. The stock slid $4.73, or 4.4 percent, to $102.01. It's down 13 percent since Dec. 27, when it closed at an all-time high. Bond prices fell slightly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.45 percent from 2.43 percent late Friday. Yields made a much bigger move earlier in the day. Utility companies fell Tuesday, and real estate investment trusts and companies that sell household goods rose less than the rest of the market. Those stocks are often compared to bonds because they pay large dividends, but the jump in yields Tuesday encouraged investors to look elsewhere. » Next page...

Having surged as much as 34 percent as of mid-April, the stock finished the year down more than 41 percent, marking its worst performance in more than 50 years. The swing reduced its market capitalization by about 1.87 trillion yen ($15.9 billion) from a record high in April. Ono’s shares had surged almost fivefold from the start of 2013 through 2015, helped in large part by expectations for Opdivo, an immune-based cancer therapy that Ono co-developed with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. The upward trend appeared poised to continue last year. In Japan’s pharmaceutical sector, 2016 was “in every sense, the ‘year of Opdivo’,” Motoya Kohtani, a Tokyo-based analyst at Nomura Securities Co., wrote in a report dated Dec. 29. Ono in April forecast a sixfold annual increase in sales of the drug, which was first approved in 2014 for melanoma and has since been cleared to treat lung tumors and head and neck cancer. Fortunes changed in August, when Opdivo failed to meet its goal in a trial for untreated non-small cell lung cancer. This allowed Merck & Co.’s rival drug Keytruda to achieve "first-mover advantage" as a first-line lung cancer treatment and narrow the market-share gap with Opdivo, according Michael Shah, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. "While Ono started the year as the pharmaceutical sector stock attracting the most attention from investors, with the August announcement of these trial results it became the stock with the worst share price performance in the sector," says Nomura’s Kohtani, who rates Ono shares neutral. The troubles were compounded by the Japan Health Ministry’s decision in November to lower Opdivo’s price by half, forcing Ono to lower its profit outlook for the current fiscal year by 25 percent. Opdivo still has chances to increase sales through approvals for other types of cancer. Ono’s stock got a lift last week after the company said it applied for approval to treat gastric cancer. In addition, Ono and Bristol-Myers have launched a patent infringement lawsuit against Merck, due to go to trial in April, that could allow it to "claw back" around 10 percent of royalties on sales of Keytruda, Nomura’s Kohtani says. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Meet the Contributors → First Trial Underway, Jounce Preps IPO To Fund Immuno-Oncology Work Ben Fidler January 3rd, 2017 @benthefidler @xconomy Like Us Xconomy Boston —  Even though Jounce Therapeutics has no human clinical data to report yet, a partnership with Celgene and support from a broad group of investors have made the Cambridge, MA, cancer drug developer a likely IPO candidate for some time now. Jounce made those intentions clear Friday, filing papers to try for an IPO that would help the company fund its first clinical trial. The question is whether Wall Street investors are willing to bet on its success. Jounce’s first study involves a cancer drug called JTX-2011. It began this past summer and should produce data next year. Jounce wants to develop drugs that boost the effectiveness of current immunotherapy treatments known as checkpoint inhibitors. Should Jounce complete the offering, it would trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker “JNCE.” It has set an early goal of raising $75 million. Using drugs to spur the immune system to fight cancer—what’s known as immuno-oncology—has produced encouraging results in certain cancer types. Four checkpoint inhibitors, from Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY), Merck (NYSE: MRK), and Roche’s Genentech group, have won FDA approval and have started to change how certain cancers of the skin, lung, and other organs are being treated. But checkpoint blockers still only work in a fraction of patients, spurring researchers and companies to test combination therapies that might represent the future of cancer care. Jounce is one of several companies in on the mix-and-match game. Jounce is developing JTX-2011, for instance, which targets what’s known as inducible T cell co-stimulator, or ICOS, a protein found on the surface of a specific type of T cell that only gets expressed in large quantities when the immune system is activated. Jounce is testing JTX-2011 in an early-stage trial in patients with solid tumors, and believes it might be effective on its own or in tandem with other drugs. Jounce is also developing its own checkpoint blocker, a drug candidate called JTX-4014 that it may test in combination with JTX-2011 or other drugs it develops internally. Jounce has plenty of well-funded competition. GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK), for example, also has an anti-ICOS drug, GSK 3359609, that began Phase 1 testing in early 2016. But Jounce does have the support of a big cancer drug maker, Celgene (NASDAQ: CELG), which in July paid Jounce $225 million in cash to get partial rights to JTX-2011 and a few other drug programs. Celgene also bought $36 million in equity and with an 11.4 percent stake is Jounce’s third-largest shareholder. (Third Rock Ventures, which formed Jounce in 2013, holds 53.5 percent of the company’s stock, while Fidelity Investments holds 12.1 percent. Jounce has raised $139 million in equity since inception and had $271 million in cash in hand as of Sept. 30, enough for at least two years of financial runway.) Biotech IPOs, meanwhile, have slowed from the boom period of 2013 to 2015. But several offerings were still completed in a down year for IPOs, largely due to heavy insider buying. According to an annual review from IPO research firm Renaissance Capital, there were 105 IPOs in 2016 across all industries, down 38 percent from 2015 and the lowest total since 2009. Healthcare remained the most active sector, driven by 40 total IPOs—29 of which were biotechs, according to the report. Renaissance expects biotechs “may need to follow the same playbook” and rely on insider participation in 2017. Even with insider help, the performance of the 2016 biotech IPO class wasn’t great. According to the Renaissance report, the top two biotech IPOs, performance-wise, were AveXis (NASDAQ: AVXS), which closed 2016 up 138 percent from its $20 IPO price in February; and Novan (NASDAQ: NOVN), which ended the year up 145 percent from its September IPO price. But the worst 2016 IPO performers were mainly small biotechs, among them PhaseRx (NASDAQ: PZRX), Kadmon Holdings (NASDAQ: KDMN), and Oncobiologics (NASDAQ: ONS).

They used the same strategy that was used to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s. Called ring vaccination, it calls for vaccinating people who have been in contact with patients, and contacts of contacts. Doctor Francis Kateh from Redemption Hospital volunteering to receive a trial vaccine against Ebola at Redemption Hospital on the outskirts of Monrovia. ZOOM DOSSO / AFP - Getty Images file It worked, the team led by the World Health Organization found. "Vaccine efficacy was 100 percent," they wrote in their report, published in Friday's issue of the Lancet medical journal. "While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during West Africa's Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenseless," said WHO's Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, who led the trial. Related: Experimental Vaccine Could Stop Ebola It's not a surprise - researchers had been working on an Ebola vaccine for years but because the virus only usually caused occasional, small outbreaks, it was hard to test it. “Vaccine efficacy was 100 percent.” Plus no governments or companies had invested the time or money needed to develop a vaccine. Then the epidemic started in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia in late 2013. By the time it was completely stopped earlier this year, it had infected 28,000 people and killed more than 11,000 of them. Researchers rushed several vaccines into production. This vaccine was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada, which licensed it to a company called NewLink Genetics. Pharma giant Merck & Co. bought the license and is making it. Related: Ebola Vaccine Trials Offer Hope It uses an animal virus called vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). The virus is harmless to people. Vaccine makers genetically engineered it to carry a little piece of Ebola DNA to stimulate an immune response. Experts including Dr. Donald A. Henderson of John Hopkins University, who helped led the campaign to eradicate smallpox, designed a ring vaccination trial. Henderson died in August. By the time all this work was done, the epidemic was waning. It's hard to test a vaccine if disease is not spreading, but the international team tried it out in a coastal region of Guinea where Ebola cases were still being reported. Related: Experimental Ebola Shot Looks Good The virus spreads by direct contact, either between people or with bodily fluids such as blood from someone very ill with Ebola, or who has died from it. The researchers tracked down every person who may have been in contact with a case, including family members and friends. Then they found people who had been in contact with those people. Each of these "rings" ended up including about 80 people. “We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured.” Half got vaccine and half did not. The trial was stopped when it became clear that the vaccine was truly protecting people from infection, even after they'd been in direct contact with an Ebola victim. The Food and Drug Administration gave the vaccine breakthrough designation to allow quick licensing. GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, has made a $5 million down payment to Merck to make sure the vaccine is available when it's next needed. Merck has promised to make 300,000 doses of the vaccine available for emergency use. "Ebola left a devastating legacy in our country. We are proud that we have been able to contribute to developing a vaccine that will prevent other nations from enduring what we endured," said Dr KeÏta Sakoba, coordinator of the Ebola response in Guinea.

Long-term safety, tapering strategies, and long-term efficacy are areas identified as needing more research. Despite nearly 70 years of experience with treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with glucocorticoids, current recommendations on the use of these drugs are vague, fail to address patient-specific factors, and are insufficiently data driven, an international group of experts has found. "The medical community has been inept at producing a solid evidence base for the proper application of glucocorticoid therapy," stated Frank Buttgereit, MD, of Charité University Hospital in Berlin, and colleagues. For instance, among 15 sets of guidelines on the systemic treatment of RA published between 2011 and 2015, there is no consistency in what the phrase "low dose" means -- less than 10 mg/day? Less than 7.5 mg/day? And when discussing tapering strategies, five guidelines provided no details at all and five others merely stated that glucocorticoids should be tapered as rapidly as possible, the researchers reported in Arthritis Care & Research. In an editorial accompanying the systematic review, Tina D. Mahajan, MD, and James R. O'Dell, MD, of the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, said of glucocorticoids, "Their efficacy is indisputable, but unfortunately despite decades of use, many questions linger about their long-term use and the magnitude of their risks." Among those risks are serious adverse events including osteoporosis, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and weight gain. "Therefore, it is an important and timely task to achieve consensus on specific conditions and circumstances for which glucocorticoids provide a positive benefit:risk ratio," Buttgereit and colleagues stated. They conducted a systematic review of the recent literature, evaluating the quality of the included guidelines and recommendations according to the AGREE II instrument, which addresses concerns such as rigor of development, clarity, and editorial independence. Their review revealed that eight of the 15 sets of guidelines considered the use of glucocorticoids as an appropriate option, particularly in early disease and for rapid symptomatic relief, while seven provide explicit recommendations for use in one or more clinical situations such as flares and as bridging therapy. Most of the guidelines favor oral administration, while several suggest that intramuscular administration is an additional option, and one recommended intravenous use for severe extra-articular involvement. Almost all of the recommendations agreed that short-term use of glucocorticoids is appropriate, with short-term referring to 3 to 24 months, and few suggesting that prolonged use is acceptable. With regard to tapering, information was "scant," with one paper suggesting that glucocorticoids be tapered to 7.5 mg/day in 6 to 12 weeks and then to the lowest possible dose, while another simply stated that the drugs should be tapered after the patient has been in persistent remission for at least 6 months. For patient-specific concerns, little advice was provided. Two recommended the use of glucocorticoids in pregnancy, only one addressed the use in light of comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, and none included age or gender-specific recommendations. Eight of the guidelines referred to a lack of sufficient evidence to provide guidance, most notably regarding long-term safety, optimal tapering strategies, and long-term efficacy. The researchers concluded that there was general consensus as to the usefulness of glucocorticoids, particularly when used for brief durations and in low doses, noting that this was "consistent with the widespread use of glucocorticoids observed in recent studies, which report prescription rates for glucocorticoid use some time during the disease course ranging from 33% to as much as 74%." They also noted that official recognition of the role of glucocorticoids has been increasing in recent years. For example, the 2012 guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology paid little attention to this issue, while the 2015 guidelines offered specific recommendations. In their editorial, Mahajan and O'Dell noted, "Glucocorticoids have had an interesting journey from miracle drug to forgotten soldier and now back to the daily workhorse whenever clinicians need rapid relief for their patients with rheumatoid arthritis." An expert task force from the European League Against Rheumatism also recently weighed in on longer term use, arguing in favor of use for 3 to 6 months or more with doses below 5 mg/day, noting that risks increase in most patients when doses exceed 10 mg/day. The ongoing GLORIA trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of longer term (2 years) low-dose (5 mg/day) among 800 older patients, and "might soon provide valuable new evidence," the researchers noted. Other aspects of treatment that need addressing in the future include consideration of the influence of circadian rhythm on glucocorticoid efficacy and safety, and the development of modified or delayed-release prednisone. With regard to the ongoing sparsity of data on the efficacy of glucocorticoids, Mahajan and O'Dell stated that "the elephant in the room" is a lack of funding. "Glucocorticoids are old drugs, and therefore no company would consider the multi-million dollars necessary to fund this much needed research," they wrote. Future authors attempting to write practice guidelines addressing the proper use of glucocorticoids face an important challenge, the editorialists wrote: "to give clinicians guidance to allow them to make the best of a drug that is both the best in certain situations and possibly the worst treatment option in others." This work was funded by the GLORIA project of the Horizon 2020 Initiative of the European Commission. Buttgereit disclosed relevant relationships with Merck Serono, Horizon Pharma (formerly Nitec Pharma),Mundipharma, and Roche. Co-authors disclosed relevant relationships with Merck, Roche, Mundipharma, Pfizer, Novartis, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Takeda and UCB. Mahajan and O'Dell disclosed no relevant relationships with industry. Reviewed by F.

These so-called “crowded trades” likely have faced the intense scrutiny of fund managers, making the share price a perfect indication of what the market thinks about the company’s value. Crowded trades also have a history of underperformance, according to analysts at investment bank Credit Suisse. They compiled a list of stocks that are very popular among actively managed funds, excluding hedge funds, quant funds, exchange-traded funds and index funds. “We recommend against owning too many of these names due to: less opportunity for differentiation, underperformance over the life of our study and heightened risk of underperformance if news flow turns negative, and ongoing outflows from actively managed funds as the shift into passive continues,” analysts led by Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse, said in a January 4 report. Her study lists hundreds of stocks by market value and investment style. Here is a list of the 25 biggest companies that are most popular among actively managed funds:   Microsoft Corp.

NEW YORK — Stocks broke a three-day losing streak Tuesday and ushered in the new year with broad gains. Health care stocks, which struggled for most of last year, climbed. Stocks started the day with a surge as the Dow Jones industrial average rose 175 points in the first hour of trading. Bond yields jumped, which took bank stocks higher. The price of oil also rose early on, but it began slipping after 10 a.m. Investors started buying again late in the day, however, and major indexes closed with a flourish. Energy companies, banks and technology companies made some of the largest gains and lower-risk investments like utility companies lagged the rest of the market. That's a sign investors expect stronger economic growth that will help those companies do more business. “Corporate earnings are telling us that it's a bull market,” said Karyn Cavanaugh of Voya Investment Strategies. Cavanaugh said earnings and revenues look “very good” for 2017. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 119.16 points, or 0.6 percent, to 19,881.76. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 19 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,257.83. The Nasdaq composite gained 45.97 points, or 0.9 percent, to 5,429.08. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks small-company stocks, added 8.36 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,365.49. The Russell rose almost 20 percent last year and did far better than indexes focused on larger companies. Drug companies helped take health care stocks higher. Merck rose $1.28, or 2.2 percent, to $60.15. Biotech giant Amgen picked up $4.52, or 3.1 percent, to $150.73 and prescription drug distributor McKesson gained $6.98, or 5 percent, to $147.43. The S&P 500's health care index fell 4 percent last year. The S&P 500 itself rose 9.5 percent for the year and all of its other industrial sectors rose at least a small amount. Investors have been avoiding drug company stocks because they're worried the government will intervene to reduce prices. But Cavanaugh said the stocks are appealing because they've been reporting better growth than most other industries. Xerox surged $1.14, or 19.8 percent, to $6.89 after it split itself in two, a move the company announced almost a year ago. The original Xerox kept its printer and copier business. The second company will focus on business process outsourcing, providing payment processing and other services. Xerox will receive $1.8 billion in cash. The new company, Conduent, now trades under the ticker symbol “CNDT.” That stock lost $1.18, or 7.9 percent, to $13.72.

Valued at a combined total of €21.8bn, the transaction saw Sanofi exchange its animal health business, Merial, for Boehringer's consumer healthcare business, CHC. Boehringer's animal health unit is now the second-largest in the business, only surpassed by Pfizer spin-out Zoetis. It will be led by Dr Joachim Hasenmaier, a member of Boehringer's board of managing directors, and based at a new operational centre in Lyon, France. Hubertus von Baumbach, chairman of Boehringer's board of managing directors, said: “This important achievement is the result of a mutually beneficial agreement implemented in the spirit of a shared vision. “Driven by the desire to serve the needs of our customer, and enabled by value of our innovative product portfolio, the combined strength of the two organisations will improve Boehringer Ingelheim's competitiveness in the animal health business segment that is so strategically important to our company.” Meanwhile, Sanofi's acquisition of CHC was approved by the European Commission in August last year, and the firm's executive vice president of consumer healthcare Alan Main will continue to oversee the expanded unit. The French group has previously said it believes the integration of the consumer healthcare business will make it the primary player in the sector, ahead of Bayer who bought Merck & Co's consumer health unit for $14.2bn in 2014. Olivier Brandicourt, chief executive of Sanofi, said: “With this successful closing of the business swap with Boehringer Ingelheim, Sanofi is building a strong and innovative CHC Global Business Unit. “The integration of Boehringer Ingelheim's highly skilled CHC team and its well established products, allows Sanofi to enhance our positions in core strategic categories in a promising CHC market. “Indeed this market serves the growing expectations of consumers to be more in control of their own health and wellness.” However, the deal isn't entirely finished. The firms are still waiting for regulatory approval for Boehringer's acquisition of Merial in Mexico and for the Merial-CHC swap in India, but anticipate closure in those markets early this year.

immune activity is viewed as the next generation of immuno-oncology News provided by Pionyr Immunotherapeutics Inc. Jan 04, 2017, 09:00 ET Share this article SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Pionyr Immunotherapeutics Inc. (formerly Precision Immune Inc.), a company harnessing the body's antitumor immunity by fine-tuning the tumor microenvironment, announced the closing of an $8 million Series A-1 investment round. The latest investment was led by OrbiMed and SV Life Sciences, and also included Osage University Partners, Mission Bay Ventures and the company's private angel investors. Pionyr's Myeloid Tuning™ technology is based on the discovery that altering the tumor microenvironment to favor immune-activating cells over immune-suppressing cells enhances the body's ability to combat cancer, particularly in combination with checkpoint inhibitors.   "Our technology represents the third generation of immuno-oncology, after checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T therapies," said Co-founder Max Krummel, Ph.D., a professor at University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, and a member of Pionyr's board of directors. "We believe our approach will usher in a new wave of therapeutics with novel mechanisms of action against new targets in the tumor microenvironment, with the potential to improve treatment for many types of cancer." Dr. Krummel, who has been making significant strides in immuno-oncology since the mid-1990s, founded Pionyr in 2015 with Sachdev Sidhu, Ph.D., formerly of Genentech and currently head of protein engineering and antibody discovery at the University of Toronto. Notably, Dr. Krummel is the co-inventor of Yervoy, the first checkpoint inhibitor, which was approved in 2011 to treat melanoma; Dr. Sidhu is a key player in early antibody phage-display technology platforms. "Max and Dev have developed a powerful platform for fine-tuning the tumor microenvironment to enhance the immune system's response against cancer," said Steven James, Pionyr's executive chairman and interim CEO. "We are building on these capabilities to develop antibody-based therapeutics with novel antigen targets and mechanisms of action. We expect to choose development candidates and drive them to IND in the near future." Pionyr Immunotherapeutics is led by industry veterans with deep management and immuno-oncology expertise. Mr. James, former CEO of Labrys Biologics (acquired by TEVA) and KAI Pharmaceuticals (acquired by Amgen), is joined on the leadership team by Michel Streuli, Ph.D., senior vice president of research, who previously led immuno-oncology efforts at Gilead, Merck (as early development chair for Keytruda), Schering-Plough and Organon. On the board of directors, in addition to Mr. James and Dr. Krummel, are Michael Ross, Ph.D., and Joshua Resnick, M.D., both partners at SV Life Sciences; and Leon Chen, Ph.D., venture partner at OrbiMed. The Series A-1 financing brings the total raised since inception to nearly $10 million. The Series A and A-1 rounds included participation from a number of individual investors including Mr. James, John Freund, Yasunori Kaneko, Bill Rieflin, Stephen Hoffman and others. About Pionyr Immunotherapeutics Pionyr (formerly Precision Immune Inc.) is developing cancer immunotherapies that target the tumor microenvironment to enhance the body's antitumor immunity. The company is exploiting novel target discovery and antibody generation platform technologies to create the third generation of immuno-oncology therapeutics after checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T. The company's approach, Myeloid Tuning™, is designed to enhance the immune system's anti-tumor response by altering the cellular infiltrate of the tumor microenvironment with high specificity.

Health care stocks, which struggled for most of last year, climbed. Stocks started the day with a surge as the Dow Jones industrial average rose 175 points in the first hour of trading. Bond yields jumped, which took bank stocks higher. The price of oil also rose early on, but it began slipping after 10 a.m. Investors started buying again late in the day, however, and major indexes closed with a flourish. Energy companies, banks and technology companies made some of the largest gains. Lower-risk investments like utility companies lagged. That's a sign investors expect stronger economic growth. "Corporate earnings are telling us that it's a bull market," said Karyn Cavanaugh of Voya Investment Strategies. Cavanaugh said earnings and revenues look "very good" for 2017. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 119.16 points, or 0.6 percent, to 19,881.76. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 19 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,257.83. The Nasdaq composite gained 45.97 points, or 0.9 percent, to 5,429.08. Drug companies helped take health care stocks higher. Merck rose $1.28, or 2.2 percent, to $60.15. Biotech giant Amgen picked up $4.52, or 3.1 percent, to $150.73 and prescription drug distributor McKesson gained $6.98, or 5 percent, to $147.43. Investors have been avoiding drug company stocks because they're worried the government will intervene to reduce prices. But Cavanaugh said the stocks are appealing because they've been reporting better growth than most other industries.

Albany, NY — (SBWIRE) — 01/03/2017 — Human reproductive technologies include procedures and therapies for conceiving or controlling pregnancy by means of artificial and/or semi artificial medical solutions. Reproductive technologies are used to treat infertility problems in males as well as in females. Since the last decade, a remarkable prevalence of infertility has been observed worldwide and its morbidity rate is rapidly growing. Changes in lifestyle such as delay in bearing the first child, use of contraceptive pills, increased alcohol consumption and smoking are some of the factors leading to increase in the infertility rate globally, due to which the human reproductive technologies market is experiencing rise in demand. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that in 2010, approximately 1.9% of women aged between 20 years and 44 years were unable to have their first child and 10.5% of women who had already conceived were unable to conceive for the subsequent times. Thus, high global infertility rates will continue to provide newer growth opportunities to this market. Some other factors contributing to the growth of the human reproductive technologies market include increasing morbidity rate of infertility in both males and females, rise in awareness about the available technologies for treating problems related to reproduction, rising prevalence of unwanted pregnancies, and overall advancement in the available technologies to control reproduction. For Any Queries Get Solutions With A PDF Sample: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=1876 Human reproductive technologies are mainly categorized on the basis of infertility treatments and contraceptive technologies. The infertility drugs market is analyzed based on the big seven brands (by sales) such as, Gonal-f, Follistim AQ, AndroGel, Testim, Viagra, Cialis and Levitra/Staxyn. Viagra, Gonal-f and AndroGel are the major drugs in their respective drug classes, which are preferred majorly for treating different causes of infertility. Further, the human reproductive technologies market is analyzed by various infertility treatment procedures which is led by the intrauterine insemination (IUI) procedure owing to low procedural cost and less complexity in performing the procedure. Contraceptive technologies market is segmented into contraceptive drugs such as oral contraceptive pills, contraceptive injectables and topical contraceptives; and devices such as male and female contraceptive devices. Within the contraceptives market, the market share of male contraceptives was the largest due to factors such as ease of use, lack of side effects and higher availability. The market will be driven by factors such as increase in conception rate, rising prevalence of unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The global human reproductive technologies market is highly fragmented in nature with many companies currently competing in the market. Well established market players such as Merck & Co., Inc., Ferring International Center S.A., Pfizer, Inc. Merck Serono and Bayer AG dominate this market with their proprietary products and predatory growth strategies. Patent repositories of the established market players are restraining the entry and growth of new players entering the market. View exclusive Global strategic Business report: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/human-reproductive-technologies-market.html Geographically, North America dominates the global human reproductive technologies market and is followed by Europe. Important factors that have led to rise in infertility incidence in North America include high obesity rates, rising age of conception and hazards emerging from shift in lifestyle. Women become less fertile at around 30 years of age and this rate speeds up after 35 years of age. Asia-Pacific is expected to show the highest growth rate in the human reproductive technologies market owing to factors such as highest population in the world, increasing awareness about reproductive technologies and increasing disposable income of the population in this region. One of the major issues restraining the market in emerging economies is the lack of initiatives to consult a specialist for reproductive disorders. However, rapid adoption of western lifestyle and rising incidence of hypertension is affecting the ability to conceive and thus, driving the demand for infertility drugs and devices in this region.

Indexes ring in new year with gains Jan 3, 2017 (…) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Conduent CEO Ashok Vemuri, center, rings a ceremonial bell as his company’s spinoff from Xerox begins trading on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks broke a three-day losing streak Tuesday and ushered in the new year with broad gains. Health care stocks, which struggled for most of last year, climbed. Stocks started the day with a surge as the Dow Jones industrial average rose 175 points in the first hour of trading. Bond yields jumped, which took bank stocks higher. The price of oil also rose early on, but it began slipping after 10 a.m. Investors started buying again late in the day, however, and major indexes closed with a flourish. Energy companies, banks and technology companies made some of the largest gains and lower-risk investments like utility companies lagged the rest of the market. That’s a sign investors expect stronger economic growth that will help those companies do more business. “Corporate earnings are telling us that it’s a bull market,” said Karyn Cavanaugh of Voya Investment Strategies. Cavanaugh said earnings and revenues look “very good” for 2017. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 119.16 points, or 0.6 percent, to 19,881.76. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 19 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,257.83. The Nasdaq composite gained 45.97 points, or 0.9 percent, to 5,429.08. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks small-company stocks, added 8.36 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,365.49. The Russell rose almost 20 percent last year. Drug companies helped take health care stocks higher. Merck rose $1.28, or 2.2 percent, to $60.15. Biotech giant Amgen picked up $4.52, or 3.1 percent, to $150.73 and prescription drug distributor McKesson gained $6.98, or 5 percent, to $147.43. The S&P 500’s health care index fell 4 percent last year. The S&P 500 itself rose 9.5 percent for the year and all of its other industrial sectors rose at least a small amount. Investors have been avoiding drug company stocks because they’re worried the government will intervene to reduce prices. But Cavanaugh said the stocks are appealing because they’ve been reporting better growth than most other industries. Xerox surged $1.14, or 19.8 percent, to $6.89 after it split itself in two, a move the company announced almost a year ago. The original Xerox kept its printer and copier business. The second company will focus on business process outsourcing, providing payment processing and other services. Xerox will receive $1.8 billion in cash. The new company, Conduent, now trades under the ticker symbol “CNDT.” That stock lost $1.18, or 7.9 percent, to $13.72. Oil prices jumped in early trading but finished lower. U.S. crude gave up $1.39, or 2.6 percent, to $52.33 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, skidded $1.35, or 2.4 percent, to $55.47 a barrel in London. Despite that slump, energy companies traded higher. But natural gas companies dropped as natural gas futures fell 40 cents, or 10.7 percent, to $3.33 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Jan 5, 2017 at 9:03AM If there has been one thing to love about Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) year in and year out, it's been the big drugmaker's dividend. With a current yield of 2.67%, investors still have reason to show the love. But there is something that might seem scary to some investors -- the company's ability to keep the dividends flowing at current levels. Are those fears warranted? Image source: Getty Images. Wild swings Bristol-Myers Squibb currently uses more than three-quarters of its earnings to fund shareholder dividends. Is that good? No, but it could be worse. In fact, it has been worse in the recent past. BMY payout ratio (TTM) data by YCharts. Over the last five years, Bristol-Myers Squibb's dividend payout ratio has experienced wild swings. This is a direct result of similarly large fluctuations in the company's earnings. BMY net income (TTM) data by YCharts. While Bristol-Myers Squibb's earnings were gyrating up and down, the drugmaker continued to steadily increase its dividend payments. Can dividends keep going up while earnings rise and fall with no clear trajectory? Not indefinitely.  How the dividends are being paid The reality is that Bristol-Myers Squibb isn't paying its dividends solely from earnings now. If we look at the company's cash flow activity from the first three quarters of 2016, Bristol didn't have enough earnings to fully cover its dividend. Data source: Bristol-Myers Squibb 10-Q. Chart by author. Bristol-Myers Squibb's net earnings of over $3.6 billion in the first three quarters of 2016 were whittled down significantly by several factors, including taxes, changes in accounts receivable, and a big divestiture impact. This left the company with a little over $1.4 billion in net cash provided by operating activities.  Dividend payments in the first three quarters of 2016 cost roughly $1.9 billion. Bristol also repurchased $231 million of stock during this period. While the company borrowed some and issued $144 million of common stock, its net cash used in financing activities was still over $1.8 billion -- primarily due to its dividend. To cover the dividend payments, Bristol-Myers Squibb had to generate additional cash. The company did so mainly by selling marketable securities and by divesting assets. The biggest divestiture was the sale of its HIV pipeline program to Viiv Healthcare, a joint venture owned by Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline. Can Bristol-Myers Squibb continue to fund its dividend payments by selling off its investments and assets? Again, not indefinitely. Scary situation? Should investors be afraid that Bristol-Myers Squibb's dividend could be in jeopardy? I don't think so, but it depends largely on how well Opdivo performs. Sales for the cancer drug are soaring. In the first three quarters of 2016, Opdivo generated $2.46 billion in revenue. Peak sales for the drug at one point topped $13 billion. Now, though, industry observers aren't quite as optimistic. That's because Opdivo disappointed in a late-stage clinical study evaluating the drug as a first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Merck, on the other hand, saw its Keytruda post glowing results in a late-stage study for the indication. Wall Street analysts now think that Keytruda will be a bigger winner than previously projected, while Opdivo's peak sales estimates were revised downward to the tune of roughly $3 billion. Even with the lower estimate for Opdivo, Bristol-Myers Squibb should experience solid earnings growth over the next several years. The company thinks that it will be able to expand indications for Opdivo by combining it with other drugs. If Bristol is right (and I suspect it is), investors should be able to keep on loving the drugmaker's dividend for years to come.  Keith Speights has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Skip to content Military Technologies pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 January 20174 January 2017 by Pharmacogenomics Market – Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, Forecast and Opportunities 2014 – 2020 ResearchMoz added Latest Research Report titled ” Pharmacogenomics Market – Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast 2014 – 2020 ” to it’s Large Report database. Pharmacogenomics deals with the study of inherited variations in human genes that affect an individual’s reaction to a particular drug. It co-integrates the genetic sciences with pharmaceutical science. Thus, it is the science of individualizing the drug, which is based on individual’s genetic makeup. And, many times pharmacogenomics are linked to personalized medicine, as the environmental conditions, genetic variations, and changing lifestyle greatly influence the type and severity of diseases as well as therapeutic responses that varies from person to person. In pharmacogenomics, various genetic tests are performed that determine or assist in targeted drug therapies as well as treatment procedures to be adopted so as to minimize side-effects and improve results. The genetic tests performed in pharmacogenomics also help to determine an individual’s susceptibility to certain diseases. Presently, pharmacogenomics is being considered to bring a new change in medicine and healthcare as it promises to offer better, safer as well as affordable healthcare. Download free Sample PDF report with TOC: www.researchmoz.us/enquiry.php?type=S&repid=228523 Some of the major driving factors for the growth of this market, include, increasing prevalence of several infectious and non-infectious diseases, rising usage in drug discovery processes, increasing demand for personalized drugs, and increasing awareness about benefits associated with pharmacogenomics. Increasing prevalence of several diseases require effective treatment therapeutics, which must be more reliable and safe at the same time. Pharmacogenomics can help achieve both and hence increasing awareness of its benefits will increase its demand across geographies, hence increased growth of the market. The application of pharmacogenomics would greatly help physicians in the treatment of a particular segment of population by studying their responses to specific drugs. Also, the knowledge of effectiveness of a drug in a patient would make a drug more reliable, and it will limit the number of drugs to be withdrawn from the market due to different adverse reactions in few patients to whom they were administered. Pharmacogenomics is also facing challenges like, predicting the association between a genetic marker and a phenotypic drug response, where other variables are also playing their role in drug response. However, recent technological advancements will allow overcoming such challenges in future, hence contributes towards the growth of this market.

Phase 1 - Dose Finding and Safety Assessment News provided by Lycera Corp. Jan 04, 2017, 08:00 ET Share this article NEW YORK and ANN ARBOR, Mich., Jan. 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Lycera Corp., a privately held biopharmaceutical company developing breakthrough immune modulatory medicines, announced today the initiation of a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of the Company's novel immuno-oncology therapeutic candidate LYC-55716, in patients with advanced, relapsed, or refractory solid tumors. "We continue to make rapid and significant progress in the development of our novel immune modulators. This is Lycera's third clinical trial initiated in the past 12 months and our first immuno-oncology compound to enter the clinic," said Paul Sekhri, President and CEO of Lycera. "The promising results of our preclinical program have provided confirmation that LYC-55716 modulates gene expression of RORgamma expressing T lymphocyte immune cells, resulting in enhanced effector function, as well as decreased immunosuppression, resulting in decreased tumor growth, and improved survival in in vivo preclinical models.  This process of reprogramming immune cells is unique from other currently approved immunotherapies, and based on this, as well as the ability to deliver this agent orally, we believe LYC-55716 could be a significant advancement for patients." "Unlike many immunotherapies that either stimulate the immune system or reduce immune suppression, Lycera's RORgamma agonist has demonstrated in preclinical models that it can simultaneously enhance T-cell function and reduce mechanisms of the immune suppression. Therapy with an oral RORgamma agonist may be able to demonstrate single agent activity, as well as show synergy in combination with other immunotherapies," said John Nemunaitis, a principal investigator and Director of the Mary Crowley Medical Research Center, Dallas, TX. "We are excited to be working with Lycera and to be working on a compound with such a novel mechanism of action." The ARGON trial (Trial of RORgamma Agonist LYC-55716 in Advanced Cancer) is a Phase 1/2a study of LYC-55716 in patients with advanced, relapsed or refractory solid tumors.  The initial Phase 1 portion of the study is designed to find the biologically active or maximum tolerated dose of LYC-55716.  The study will utilize a 3+3 study design, in which LYC-55716 will be administered orally in subjects with relapsed or refractory solid tumors. The primary endpoints are safety and tolerability, and the study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose. Upon dose determination, LYC-55716 will enter Phase 2a, which is expected to enroll approximately 40 patients.  The primary efficacy endpoint of the Phase 2a portion of the study will be objective response rate according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors. About LYC-55716 LYC-55716 is a first in class oral, selective RORgamma agonist. The retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma (RORgamma) is a nuclear receptor transcription factor that acts as an immune cell master control switch.  RORgamma agonists modulate gene expression to reprogram immune cells for improved function, as well as decrease immunosuppressive mechanisms, resulting in decreased tumor growth and enhanced survival in in vivo preclinical models of cancer.  Essentially, Lycera's RORgamma agonist approach "removes the brake" and "pushes on the accelerator" of immune function. About Lycera Lycera is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel oral immune modulators for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer. Based on successful progress of its world-class R&D platform, including expertise in immune metabolism, cell signaling, and immune cell differentiation, Lycera has commenced multiple clinical programs in 2016. The company is advancing a wholly owned, oral, gut-directed ATPase modulator, designated LYC-30937-EC, for the treatment of autoimmune disease, and has entered Phase 2 clinical studies in patients with ulcerative colitis and psoriasis. A second product candidate, LYC-55716, an oral RORgamma agonist, has progressed into Phase 1/2a testing in patients with advanced solid tumors. Lycera has an exclusive strategic collaboration with Celgene Corporation to advance Lycera's proprietary pipeline for cancer and immune-mediated diseases. In addition, Lycera had previously established collaborations with Merck to discover, develop, and commercialize small molecule therapies for autoimmune disorders. Lycera's leadership possesses deep experience in drug discovery, development, and commercialization and has established close relationships with renowned thought leaders and clinical researchers worldwide. Lycera was founded in 2006 based on an initial scientific platform in-licensed from the University of Michigan.
