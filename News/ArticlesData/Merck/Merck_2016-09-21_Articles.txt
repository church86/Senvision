Women are five to eight times more likely to suffer from thyroid disorders than men[1]. This memorandum of understanding and its resulting policies, which has been signed today, will support women's health and well-being in Jordan, helping women to be more active participants in their local economies.      (Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160922/410987 )  "We are excited about our new partnership with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, which opens new horizons for RHAS to scale up and expand its outreach with a particular focus on women," Hanin Odeh, Director General of RHAS, commented on the signing. "Through this initiative, we are not only helping women look after the health of their children and families better, but more importantly, ensuring that women are looking after their own health. No doubt, if women are not healthy, we are jeopardizing our country's potential on various levels. We are glad that we could benefit from Merck's experience in this area, and adapt scientific and tested approaches, towards a healthier Jordan." The memorandum is part of the global Healthy Women, Healthy Economies initiative, an innovative public-private partnership that explicitly links the issue of women's health and well-being with economic growth. The partnership will focus on developing a thyroid awareness campaign through expanding the Healthy Community Clinic program under RHAS' umbrella. This campaign aims to reach patients, most of whom are women, and health practitioners to promote healthy lifestyles, raise awareness on the importance of diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disease, and it will lay the ground work for further programs addressing other non-communicable diseases that disproportionately affect women. "Advocating for better health, and especially women's health, creates a ripple effect uplifting entire families, communities and future generations. We are proud to partner with RHAS to expand the Healthy Women, Healthy Economies initiative into Jordan. When women do better, communities become stronger and this reflects favourably on economies," said Belén Garijo, Member of the Executive Board and CEO Healthcare at Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. This memorandum is now the second of its kind signed by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany under the program, following a 2015 partnership with the Philippine Department of Health and Philippine Thyroid Association. Healthy Women, Healthy Economies is an innovative public-private partnership under the auspices of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and the U.S. and Philippine governments that explicitly links the issue of women's health and well-being with economic growth. Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany pursues three strategic spheres of corporate responsibility, namely health, environment and culture. Healthy Women, Healthy Economies brings to life Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany's heritage of corporate responsibility and long-term vision to tackle big issues in health, like gender equality in the workforce and access to high-quality health solutions. Healthy Women, Healthy Economies brings together the evidence about women's health and well-being and its impact on economic growth with the best practices that governments, employers and non-governmental organizations can follow. It aims to identify and implement policies that advance women's health and well-being to increase their economic participation in the societies they live in.

Women are five to eight times more likely to suffer from thyroid disorders than men[1]. This memorandum of understanding and its resulting policies, which has been signed today, will support women's health and well-being in Jordan, helping women to be more active participants in their local economies. (Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160922/410985 ) "We areexcited aboutour new partnership with Merck, which opens new horizons for RHAS toscale up andexpand its outreachwith a particular focus on women," Hanin Odeh, Director General of RHAS, commented on thesigning."Through this initiative, we are not onlyhelpingwomen look after the health of their children and familiesbetter, but more importantly, ensuring that women are looking after theirownhealth.No doubt, if women are not healthy, we are jeopardizing our country's potential on various levels. We are glad that we could benefit from Merck's experience in this area, and adapt scientific and tested approaches, towards a healthier Jordan." The memorandum is part of the global Healthy Women, Healthy Economies initiative, an innovative public-private partnership that explicitly links the issue of women's health and well-being with economic growth. The partnership will focus on developing a thyroid awareness campaign through expanding the Healthy Community Clinic program under RHAS' umbrella. This campaign aims to reach patients, most of whom are women, and health practitioners to promote healthy lifestyles, raise awareness on the importance of diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disease, and it will lay the ground work for further programs addressing other non-communicable diseases that disproportionately affect women. "Advocating for better health, and especially women's health, creates a ripple effect, uplifting entire families, communities and future generations. We are proud to partner with RHAS to expand the Healthy Women, Healthy Economies initiative into Jordan. When women do better, communities become stronger and this reflects favourably on economies," said Belén Garijo, Member of the Executive Board and CEO Healthcare at Merck. This memorandum is now the second of its kind signed by Merck under the program, following a 2015 partnership with the Philippine Department of Health and Philippine Thyroid Association. Healthy Women, Healthy Economies is an innovative public-private partnership under the auspices of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, Merck, and the U.S. and Philippine governments that explicitly links the issue of women's health and well-being with economic growth. Merck pursues three strategic spheres of corporate responsibility, namely health, environment and culture. Healthy Women, Healthy Economies brings to life Merck's heritage of corporate responsibility and long-term vision to tackle big issues in health, like gender equality in the workforce and access to high-quality health solutions. Healthy Women, Healthy Economies brings together the evidence about women's health and well-being and its impact on economic growth with the best practices that governments, employers and non-governmental organizations can follow. It aims to identify and implement policies that advance women's health and well-being to increase their economic participation in the societies they live in.

Print Share All News Consumer Pharma New Drugs Pipeline Clinical Trials FDA Alerts Merck and Pfizer Announce Investigational Ertugliflozin Met Primary Endpoint of A1C Reduction When Added to Sitagliptin and Metformin in People with Type 2 Diabetes Tweet KENILWORTH, N.J., and NEW YORK, N.Y., September 15, 2016 -- Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, in partnership with Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today announced that a Phase 3 study (VERTIS SITA2) of ertugliflozin, an investigational oral SGLT2 inhibitor for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes, met its primary endpoint. Both 5 mg and 15 mg daily doses of ertugliflozin showed significantly greater reductions in A1C* of 0.69 percent and 0.76 percent, respectively, compared with placebo (p<0.001, for both comparisons), when added to patients on a background of sitagliptin (100 mg/day) and stable metformin (≥1500 mg/day). These study results were presented for the first time during an oral session today at the 52nd Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in Munich, Germany. Merck and Pfizer plan to submit New Drug Applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for ertugliflozin and two fixed-dose combinations (ertugliflozin plus JANUVIA® (sitagliptin) and ertugliflozin plus metformin) by the end of 2016, with additional regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. to follow in 2017. “It is encouraging to see further data from the VERTIS clinical development program in support of combining ertugliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, with the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin, which was first approved 10 years ago,” said Peter Stein, M.D., vice president, late stage development, diabetes and endocrinology, Merck. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 463 patients with type 2 diabetes and a baseline A1C of 7.0 – 10.5 percent were randomized to receive ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. In addition to meeting the primary endpoint of reducing A1C at 26 weeks, ertugliflozin also met the following key secondary endpoints in the study: A greater proportion of patients taking ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg achieved the A1C treatment goal of less than 7.0 percent (32.1 percent and 39.9 percent, respectively) compared with the placebo group (17.0 percent) (p<0.001, for both comparisons based on adjusted odds ratios); Placebo-adjusted mean reduction in body weight of 4.4 lbs (2.0 kg) for the 5 mg dose and 3.7 lbs (1.7 kg) for the 15 mg dose (p<0.001, for both comparisons); Placebo-adjusted mean reductions in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of 25.1 mg/dl (1.4 mmol/L) for the 5 mg dose and 31.3 mg/dl (1.7 mmol/L) for the 15 mg dose (p<0.001, for both comparisons); Placebo-adjusted mean reductions in systolic blood pressure of 2.9 mmHg (5 mg, p=0.019) and 3.9 mmHg (15 mg, p=0.002). “We are pleased to share these new data on investigational ertugliflozin with the scientific community, following the first presentations of Phase 3 data for ertugliflozin at the American Diabetes Association’s 76th Scientific Sessions in June,” said James Rusnak, M.D., Ph.D., chief development officer, cardiovascular & metabolics, Pfizer. “Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease and these study results help support the clinical profile of ertugliflozin as an add-on therapy for patients who may require multiple treatment combinations to help reach their blood sugar goals.” Overall adverse event (AE) rates were generally similar between ertugliflozin 5 mg (41.7 percent), ertugliflozin 15 mg (43.8 percent) and placebo (48.4 percent), with a similar rate of one or more serious AEs across all groups (4.5 percent for ertugliflozin 5 mg; 2.0 percent for ertugliflozin 15 mg; 3.3 percent for placebo). The rates of discontinuations due to AEs were low across all groups (3.2 percent for ertugliflozin 5 mg; 0.7 percent for ertugliflozin 15 mg; 0.7 percent for placebo). In the study, a higher incidence of genital mycotic infections was observed in patients taking ertugliflozin 5 mg and ertugliflozin 15 mg (males: 4.9 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively, vs. no events for placebo; females: 8.0 percent and 12.7 percent, respectively, vs. 1.9 percent for placebo). Urinary tract infection rates were low across the ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo groups (2.6 percent, 4.6 percent and 2.0 percent, respectively). Across groups, there were similar rates for symptomatic hypoglycemia (3.8 percent for ertugliflozin 5 mg; 0.7 percent for ertugliflozin 15 mg; 2.6 percent for placebo) and for hypovolemia adverse events (0.6 percent for ertugliflozin 5 mg; no events for ertugliflozin 15 mg; 0.7 percent for placebo). About the VERTIS Clinical Development Program for Ertugliflozin In addition to the VERTIS MONO and VERTIS FACTORIAL studies, which were presented at the 76th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association, VERTIS SITA2 is a part of the VERTIS clinical development program comprised of a total of nine Phase 3 trials in approximately 12,600 adults with type 2 diabetes. Results from the other six VERTIS trials will be submitted for publication and/or presentation at future scientific congresses.

The U.S. spends more per capita on healthcare than any other country, yet we have one of the sickest populations. Why is this? And what can we do about it? Big Pharma is spending billions to control the ‘health’care system in the U.S. But do they really care about public health – or their profits? Are we deliberately being kept sick? Who really controls what you read and hear about the ‘health’care system? Does your doctor listen to pharma reps more than patients? How do we stay healthy in a system that wants to keep us sick? Why the huge push for vaccine mandates – is it really for public health – or for profit? This is one of the most pressing issues we face today! If we don’t have our health, what do we really have? It’s now or never. We need to TAKE BACK our health! The hour-long talk will be followed by an interactive Q&A discussion about the state of ‘health’care in the U.S. today. EVENT INFO – WHEN/WHERE: “Is Your Health For $ale?” Sunday, September 25, 2016 at 1 p.m. United Irish Cultural Center 2700 45th Avenue (at Sloat Blvd.) San Francisco, CA FREE street parking.

RSVP at healthforsale2016@yahoo.com and specify number of seats. About Learn The Risk and Brandy Vaughan: Brandy Vaughan is a former pharmaceutical representative for Merck. She advised doctors on the Rx medications her company manufactured. Brandy sold Vioxx, a painkiller that harmed or killed thousands of Americans, and doubled the risk of stroke and heart attacks before it was taken off the market. “From that experience, I realized that just because something is on the market, doesn’t mean it’s safe,” she explains. Brandy left the business horrified and disillusioned at the inner workings and dealings of the industry. As an insider, she knows that Rx’s and vaccines are manufactured without adequate testing, and the huge risks that the public never hears about. She founded LearnTheRisk.org in response. It is a valuable site for information, facts and truth you will never get from media, government agencies, nor most doctors. For unbiased information, facts, statistics and vaccine education from independent sources that are not paid by the pharmaceutical companies whose products they push, visit http://LearnTheRisk.org/ and https://www.facebook.com/LearnTheRisk/. “Learn The Risk” is a campaign produced by the Council for Vaccine Safety, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.

The U.S. spends more per capita on ‘health’care than any other country, yet we have one of the sickest populations. Why is this? And what can we do about it? Big Pharma is spending billions to control the ‘health’care system in the U.S. But do they really care about public health – or their profits? Are we deliberately being kept sick? Who really controls what you read and hear about the ‘health’care system? Does your doctor listen to pharma reps more than patients? How do we stay healthy in a system that wants to keep us sick? Why the huge push for vaccine mandates – is it really for public health – or for profit? This is one of the most pressing issues we face today: If we don’t have our health, what do we really have? It’s now or never. We need to TAKE BACK our health! The hour-long talk will be followed by an interactive Q&A discussion about the state of ‘health’care in the U.S. today. EVENT INFO – WHEN/WHERE: Sunday, September 25, 2016 at 1 p.m. United Irish Cultural Center 2700 45th Avenue (at Sloat Blvd.) San Francisco, CA FREE street parking. It will also be livestreamed via Facebook for those who cannot attend in person. Visit https://www.facebook.com/brandy.vaughan.98 for the livestream. RSVP at healthforsale2016@yahoo.com and specify number of seats. About LearnTheRisk.org and Brandy Vaughan: Brandy Vaughan is a former pharmaceutical representative for Merck. She advised doctors on the Rx medications her company manufactured. Brandy sold Vioxx, a painkiller that harmed or killed thousands of Americans, and doubled the risk of stroke and heart attacks before it was taken off the market. “From that experience, I realized that just because something is on the market, doesn’t mean it’s safe,” she explains. Brandy left the business horrified and disillusioned at the inner workings and dealings of the industry. As an insider, she knows that Rx’s and vaccines are manufactured without adequate testing, and the huge risks that the public never hears about. She founded LearnTheRisk.org in response. It is a valuable site for information, facts and truth you will never get from media, government agencies, nor most doctors. For unbiased information, facts, statistics and vaccine education from independent sources that are not paid by the pharmaceutical companies whose products they push, visit http://LearnTheRisk.org/ and https://www.facebook.com/LearnTheRisk/. LearnTheRisk.org is a campaign produced by the Council for Vaccine Safety, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. Learn more: http://councilforvaccinesafety.org/.

Merck and the Royal Health Awareness Society Partner to Advance Women's Health in Jordan Merck and the Royal Health Awareness Society Partner to Advance Women's Health in Jordan CHIMICA E FARMACIA Tweet Condividi su WhatsApp Pubblicato il: 22/09/2016 20:12 DARMSTADT, Germany, September 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Merck, a leading science and technology company, today announced its partnership with the Royal Health Awareness Society (RHAS) of Jordan to advance health awareness and education particularly on thyroid disease amongst Jordanian women. Women are five to eight times more likely to suffer from thyroid disorders than men[ 1 ]. This memorandum of understanding and its resulting policies, which has been signed today, will support women's health and well-being in Jordan, helping women to be more active participants in their local economies.      (Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160922/410985 ) "We are excited about our new partnership with Merck, which opens new horizons for RHAS to scale up and expand its outreach with a particular focus on women," Hanin Odeh, Director General of RHAS, commented on the signing. "Through this initiative, we are not only helping women look after the health of their children and families better, but more importantly, ensuring that women are looking after their own health. No doubt, if women are not healthy, we are jeopardizing our country's potential on various levels. We are glad that we could benefit from Merck's experience in this area, and adapt scientific and tested approaches, towards a healthier Jordan." The memorandum is part of the global Healthy Women, Healthy Economies initiative, an innovative public-private partnership that explicitly links the issue of women's health and well-being with economic growth. The partnership will focus on developing a thyroid awareness campaign through expanding the Healthy Community Clinic program under RHAS' umbrella. This campaign aims to reach patients, most of whom are women, and health practitioners to promote healthy lifestyles, raise awareness on the importance of diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disease, and it will lay the ground work for further programs addressing other non-communicable diseases that disproportionately affect women. "Advocating for better health, and especially women's health, creates a ripple effect, uplifting entire families, communities and future generations. We are proud to partner with RHAS to expand the Healthy Women, Healthy Economies initiative into Jordan. When women do better, communities become stronger and this reflects favourably on economies," said Belén Garijo, Member of the Executive Board and CEO Healthcare at Merck. This memorandum is now the second of its kind signed by Merck under the program, following a 2015 partnership with the Philippine Department of Health and Philippine Thyroid Association. Healthy Women, Healthy Economies is an innovative public-private partnership under the auspices of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, Merck, and the U.S. and Philippine governments that explicitly links the issue of women's health and well-being with economic growth. Merck pursues three strategic spheres of corporate responsibility, namely health, environment and culture. Healthy Women, Healthy Economies brings to life Merck's heritage of corporate responsibility and long-term vision to tackle big issues in health, like gender equality in the workforce and access to high-quality health solutions. Healthy Women, Healthy Economies brings together the evidence about women's health and well-being and its impact on economic growth with the best practices that governments, employers and non-governmental organizations can follow. It aims to identify and implement policies that advance women's health and well-being to increase their economic participation in the societies they live in. References  About RHAS  The Royal Health Awareness Society was established in 2005 under the direction of Her Majesty Queen Rania Al-Abdullah to promote health awareness and to empower Jordanians to adopt healthy lifestyles and behaviors. To achieve its mission, RHAS adopts a comprehensive approach, through implementing preventative public health and safety programs based on the right to health for all, targeting school children, youth and the community at large.   All Merck Press Releases are distributed by e-mail at the same time they become available on the Merck Website.

Sep 22, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet A leading science and technology company, has announced that the largest delivery of praziquantel tablets ever shipped to Angola recently arrived in Luanda, the capital of country. Angola has received around 4 million tablets for mass distribution to school children. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Angola is one of the most endemic countries for schistosomiasis worldwide. It is estimated that around 26% of the overall population requires treatment. Angola has been participating in the Merck Praziquantel Donation Program since 2008 and has received nearly 12 million tablets to date. “We want to contribute to eliminating the insidious worm disease in order to help infected children to take part in the economic development of their home countries. With our donation of approximately 4 million tablets to WHO for Angola approximately 1.6 million school children can be treated – covering half of the country’s school-aged population in need of treatment. This shows that we are on the right track. However, we know that we alone cannot solve the problem with our tablets,” said Eduardo Carvalho, General Manager of Merck in Angola. As part of its responsibility for society and within Health, one of its corporate responsibility strategic spheres of activity, Merck is supporting WHO in the fight against the worm disease schistosomiasis in Africa. Since 2007, more than 74 million patients, primarily school children, have been treated. To this end, Merck has donated over 340 million praziquantel tablets to WHO. Praziquantel is well tolerated and the most effective treatment to date for schistosomiasis. Merck is also supporting educational and awareness programs in Africa, developing schistosomiasis therapies for very young children and cooperating with partners in the Global Schistosomiasis Alliance.   Do you have more to share about this story - photos or video etc - you can send them to: (newsghana101@gmail.com) TAGS Angola Luanda Merck Praziquantel Donation Program praziquantel Schistosomiasis Tablets World Health Organization SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleE/R: 22 people to appear before court today over Begoro police attacks Next articleAssessing the Buhari administration: Nnamdi Akwada writes News Ghana RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Hajia Samira: Just Like An Amazonian At The War Front Namibia loses 4,000 chickens to Newcastle disease The Need For Peace In Ghana LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Get more stuff like this in your inbox Subscribe to our mailing list and get interesting stuff and updates to your email inbox. we respect your privacy and take protecting it seriously Recent Posts Akwamu kingdom pledges support for Nana Addo J.

(PRWEB) September 21, 2016 Bioclinica®, a provider of specialized technology-enabled services supporting clinical trials, today announced that bio-pharma and CROs convened at its 2016 Annual Global eHealth Conference held in Chicago earlier this month. The event drew together an international group that shared eHealth vision as well as lessons learned, best practices, and success stories using Bioclinica eHealth technologies to advance clinical development. “There was a tremendous exchange of ideas, generating an exciting vision as to where we can go as an industry if we allow this remarkable technology to take us there,” said Bioclinica President of eHealth Solutions Mukhtar Ahmed. “The Bioclinica eHealth platform is a driving force for industry change, benefitting patients and the entire research community.” Attendees heard from more than 30 speakers representing a mix of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and CROs, among them Baxter Healthcare; Biogen; Cardialysis; Fisher Clinical; Gilead; GSK; Janssen; Merck; Pfizer; Pharmacyclics; Premier Research; Ultragenyx; and Worldwide Clinical Trials. Participating App xChange partners included Vitrana, ArisGlobal, AiCure, Arivis, and Parallel 6. Glen Tullman, Chairman and CEO of Livongo Health and former CEO of Allscripts, delivered a provocative keynote, “The Coming Sea of Change in Healthcare.” Tullman traced the healthcare revolution to date, exploring trends and “dramatic consequences felt on every facet of healthcarefrom EHRs and chronic disease, to pharmaceuticals, clinical trials, and everything in between.” Bioclinica eHealth Solutions Chief Technology Officer Andrew Masters presented the product roadmap for the eHealth business segment comprising the eClinical, Safety & Regulatory, and Financial Lifecycle Solutions divisions. Masters recapped recent significant developments made over the past 12 months marked by several product launches by all three divisions, as well as core product enhancements to OnPoint CTMS, Trident RTSM, Express EDC, and Compass for risk-based monitoring. Masters said, “Our eHealth team is continually innovating with our customers to keep them out front with a dynamic technology platform.” He noted several key eClinical systems integrations, including with App xChange partners, as well as integrations between ClinPay and EDC systems, both Bioclinica’s Express and other providers. Session highlights include: eHealth Solutions Vice President of Technology Alliances Anne Zielinski teamed with Tullman and Masters in a panel discussion on the current and future state of clinical trials, examining mobile health, patient centricity, and big data. Zielinski also spoke in a session on patient centricity, showing how eHealth App xChange technology can close the gap between patients, clinical researchers, and other stakeholders for a better patient experience. “Bioclinica’s App xChange provides an extended eHealth platform, making the research process easier and more engaging for patients and less burdensome on all involved,” said Zielinski. Jay Ehrlich, Vice President of Global Patient Safety, Baxter Healthcare, presented on pharmacovigilance as a service (PVaaS), a unique end-to-end safety solutions offering introduced by Bioclinica earlier this year. Baxter and other biopharma companies have quickly embraced the model in which Bioclinica safety experts address all pharmacovigilance aspects, including application implementation, management and hosting, business process support, workflow automation, and quality management for more efficient resource utilization. A case study presented by Cognizant in which Bioclinica’s Trident IRT Plus program, a Randomization and Trial Supply Management (RTSM) study implementation model used by AbbVie, enables dynamic responses to evolving business requirements. Cognizant’s IRT Onsite Coordinator Shiny Vincent and AbbVie’s Principal Interface Designer E-Quana Graham, presented with Bioclinica’s Vice President of RTSM and Supply Chain Ken Clark on how Bioclinica’s IRTPlus program has accelerated study delivery at AbbVie. “Using an agile IRT approach enables Bioclinica’s customers to build and maintain high-quality studies despite a great degree of study complexity,” explained Clark. Jay Trepanier, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Bioclinica Financial Lifecycle Solutions presented an overview on ClinPay and ClinPlan, core components used by biopharma companies and CROs to automate the financial lifecycle in clinical trials, including the site and patient payment process. eClinical General Manager Mike Petrarca co-presented with Director of eClinical Solutions Jennifer Price on the end-to-end clinical trial eHealth platform. They showed the patient data journey beginning with planning of clinical supplies, followed by the use of different mobile devices for data entry, on through to the making of site and patient payments, and performing activities such as patient safety monitoring. The eHealth Conference, in addition to serving as a key source of industry information, provided Bioclinica product engineers and professional services team a forum to stay connected to customers’ emerging technology needs. “We thank everyone who participated in this exceptional event,” Masters said. “The customer and partner engagement experienced during the eHealth Conference serves to strengthen the value Bioclinica is able to deliver along this exciting journey.” A partial listing of upcoming industry events featuring Bioclinica experts includes: 2016 Global Site Solutions Summit, October 13-16 2016 European Global Clinical Supplies Group Conference, October 18-20 IRT 2016, October 28-29 DIA Japan, November 13-15 PCT Europe 2016, November 16-17 For the latest Company news and information, follow Bioclinica on the blog at http://www.bioclinica.com/blog and on Twitter at http://twitter.com/bioclinica.

The EU regulator has agreed to start its review of BMS' application based on the results of the phase II CheckMate-275 study of PD-1 inhibitor Opdivo (nivolumab) in metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) patients previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.  UC accounts for around 90% of all cases of bladder cancer, which in turn is the fifth most common cancer affecting almost 430,000 people every year.  Approval in that large indication would give Opdivo a boost after a disappointing outcome in a first-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) trial that handed a competitive advantage to rival PD- inhibitor - Merck & Co's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) - in that indication. The filing puts BMS just behind Roche in the EU race to market for immuno-oncology treatments for bladder cancer. Roche has already bagged a US approval for PD-L1 inhibitor Tecentriq (atezolizumab) for second-line UC in the US and seems to have filed the drug for that indication in Europe - although the company has made no public announcement to that effect. Keytruda has also shown efficacy in bladder cancer but according to Merck's latest pipeline update has not yet been filed for approval in this indication. Meanwhile, BMS is also talking to the FDA about a marketing application based on the CheckMate-275 data, which is due to be reported at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress next month. Bladder cancer has proved to be remarkably resistant to new drug therapy. The standard of care remains cisplatin and there have been few treatment advances over the last 30 years, so immuno-oncology agents are expected to make swift and dramatic headway both in the second- and first-line treatment settings. Analysts have predicted that Tecentriq could become a $3bn product if its first-mover advantage in bladder cancer is bolstered by follow-up approvals in lung, colorectal, urogenital and kidney cancers.

Volatile oil prices pressured energy shares, limiting overall gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose a tepid 9.79 points, or less than 0.1%, to close at 18,129.96, with gainers and decliners split evenly among the 30 Dow components. The Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 6.33 points, or 0.1%, to 5,241.35, nudged higher by gains in biotech. The S&P 500 index finished up less than a point at 2,139.76. Health care and consumer staples led winners, while energy shares lagged behind. Merck & Co.and McDonald's topped advancers, while Exxon Mobil and DuPont& Co. were the worst blue-chip performers. Among economic data expected at Wall Street, Housing starts for August came in at a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.142 million (consensus 1.186 million) while building permits fell to 1.139 million (consensus 1.160 million) due entirely to a 7.2% decline in permits for multi-unit dwellings. The data follows yesterday's above-consensus reading of the NAHB Housing Market Index for September. Although overall market reaction to weaker-than-expected housing starts data ahead of the bell was muted, home-building stocks such as Lennar Corp and PulteGroup were hit hard, falling 3.5% and 2.9% respectively. The Fed will release its updated policy statement at 2 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday. Investors widely expect the central bank to stand pat on interest rates, so attention is instead being trained on the BOJ where policy surprises are seen as more likely. Japanese policy makers have fought hard in recent years to battle low inflation, slow growth and a strong yen, lowering rates into negative territory and launching an aggressive asset-purchase program. However, there is a heightened sense the measures aren't producing their desired result. The health care sector outperformed as drug manufacturers and biotechnology names displayed relative strength. Biotechnology rallied after Allergan agreed to acquire Tobira Therapeutics for an upfront payment of $28.35 per share. This constitutes a 498.0% premium from Tobira's prior closing price. The agreement also contains Contingent Value Rights that could increase total considerations up to $49.84 per share. Crude oil futures ended on a mixed note on Tuesday, 20 September 2016 with Brent crude modestly lower but West Texas Intermediate crude slightly higher, as traders weighed the possibility of a crude output deal following reports that Russia supports a one-year pact to stabilize prices.nHowever, weekly data expected to show the first increase in U.S. crude supplies in three weeks and a substantial slide by gasoline futures, with a major gasoline pipeline expected to return to operation on Wednesday, kept prices in check. October West Texas Intermediate crude rose by 14 cents, or 0.3%, to settle at $43.44 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on the contract's expiration day. The November WTI contract which became the front month, added 19 cents, or 0.4%, to $44.05. However, November Brent crude on the ICE Futures exchange in London lost 7 cents, or less than 0.2%, to finish at $45.88 a barrel. Bullion prices ended in a mixed mode on Tuesday, 20 September 2016 at Comex. Gold futures on Tuesday ended with a slight gain, but moved in a narrow trading range, as focus remained fixed on the dollar's next move a day ahead of policy announcements from the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan. December gold picked up 40 cents to settle at $1,318.20 an ounce. The metal closed 0.6% higher on Monday. December silver fell 1.3 cents, or less than 0.1%, to $19.277 an ounce on Tuesday. The ICE U.S. dollar index, a measure of the greenback against six currencies, was up 0.2%. Treasuries ended on a higher note with the long end of the curve outperforming. The yield on the 2-yr note fell one basis point (0.77%) while the yield on the 10-yr note declined three basis points (1.69%). Today's participation was below the recent average as fewer than 741 million shares changed hands on the NYSE floor. Tomorrow's economic data will be limited to the weekly MBA Mortgage Index, which will be released at 7:00 ET. Meanwhile, the FOMC will release its September policy statement and rate decision at 14:00 ET.

This feature is brought to you by The Scotsman and Young Company Finance. Rebecca Pick with her Personal Guardian attack alarm, set to launch next year. Picture: Contributed Glasgow safety alarm start-up secures £744,000 funding A Glasgow-based start-up that has developed a personal attack alarm has raised £744,000 to help bring the product to market. Pick Protection is the brainchild of University of Strathclyde graduate Rebecca Pick, who developed the idea for the Personal Guardian device following an attack on a neighbour. Having raised £60,000 from an angle investment syndicate last year, the firm has now secured £744,000 in a funding round led by Equity Gap, with other backers including the University of Strathclyde, Gabriel Investment Syndicate, the Scottish Investment Bank and manufacturer Unipart Group. Tobacco giant BAT eyes £38bn merger with Camel owner British American Tobacco (BAT) has proposed a $47 billion (£38bn) merger with US tobacco firm Reynolds, the maker of Camel and Pall Mall. If it goes ahead, the deal would create the world’s largest listed tobacco company. BAT currently owns 42.2 per cent of Reynolds and the proposal involves the acquisition of the remaining 57.8 per cent of the company. Heathrow boss insists airport has support for expansion Heathrow Airport’s chief executive has said there remains support “from Newquay to Inverness” for the government to rule in favour of the airport’s expansion over rival Gatwick. John Holland‑Kaye also said Theresa May was “showing leadership”, despite the Prime Minister being accused of dithering over the decision on a third runway. “There’s no policy reason at all stopping us from getting on with Heathrow,” he added. Martin Flanagan: Humiliation for BHS ‘spiv’ Philip Green “It doesn’t get much heavier and more humiliating than a unanimous recommendation of MPs that the Honours Forfeiture Committee strip Sir Philip Green of his knighthood,” writes Martin Flanagan. “The language yesterday, protected by parliamentary privilege, was ripe. ‘Billionaire spiv’, ‘personal fiefdoms’, ‘traditional asset stripper’ and ‘one of the biggest corporate scandals of modern times’ give a flavour of it.” Click here to ‘Like’ The Scotsman Business on Facebook For anyone interested in following the progress of early stage companies in Scotland, and in particular how they fund their development, the monthly newsletter published by Young Company Finance (www.ycfscotland.co.uk) is an essential resource.

Picture: Jane Barlow EMMA NEWLANDS 07:19 Wednesday 21 September 2016 0 Have your say The University of Dundee has renewed seven-figure funding from three top pharmaceutical companies, supporting work to launch and speed up the development of new drugs to treat diseases like cancer and Parkinson’s. The £7.2 million funding from industry to academia comes from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Boehringer Ingelheim, and Merck, and secures 38 posts at Dundee for the next four years. The university said the sum will support its division of signal transduction therapy (DSTT), the world’s longest-running collaboration between academic research laboratories and the pharmaceutical industry, and founded in 1998. READ MORE: Dundee University one of Europe’s most innovative The division works to help identify new drug targets and then accelerate the early-phase development of better treatments for major global diseases. Additionally, 12 of its 22 research teams are based in the Medical Research Council Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit (MRC-PPU). Dario Alessi, MRC-PPU director, said: “I am absolutely thrilled that we have been able to renew this remarkable 18-year flagship collaboration with our pharmaceutical partners. This alliance has never been more important as our Dundee-based researchers are making such tremendous progress in better understanding human diseases such as Parkinson’s, immune conditions and cancer.” Malcolm Skingle, director of academic liaison at GSK, said that by working with the university “we’re making inroads in our understanding of a broad range of chronic diseases, and we believe that by continuing our work together we’ll be able to accelerate the translation of this knowledge in to new treatments for patients”.

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, is now in the sights of more than a dozen drugmakers. Allergan Plc became the latest Tuesday. It announced two deals in less than 12 hours to acquire companies developing NASH treatments, including Tobira Therapeutics Inc. for as much as $1.7 billion in what Chief Executive Officer Brent Saunders said Wednesday was a “very competitive situation.” Allergan is racing companies ranging from startup Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc. to giants including Gilead Sciences Inc. and Pfizer Inc. to reach an untapped market that could be worth $5 billion to $10 billion a year, according to a May estimate by RBC Capital Markets Corp. analyst Michael Yee. Drugmakers are still working to determine how different components of the disease -- inflammation, scarring and metabolic changes -- interact and are experimenting with a variety of treatment mechanisms. With so many companies piling into the field, they’ll have to work to distinguish themselves. “We’re looking for something that’s got a ‘wow’ factor,” said Alex DePaoli, chief medical officer of closely held NGM Biopharmaceuticals Inc., which has a NASH partnership with Merck & Co. “We want to develop something that pops your eyes out.” Fatty Liver NASH occurs when fat accumulates in the liver along with inflammation and damage, and as much as a quarter of the U.S. population may have a precursor condition, called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The ailment develops slowly, and patients often don’t show symptoms until their livers are heavily damaged. It’s most common in people who are overweight or have diabetes, and doctors mainly prescribe diet changes and weight loss. While doctors need to perform a biopsy to diagnose NASH, about 6 million to 15 million people in the U.S. alone are estimated to have the condition, and about 20 percent of them will go on to develop life-threatening cirrhosis. NASH will be the leading cause of liver transplants by 2020, according to Allergan. Drugs that treat it will likely command high prices, Elizabeth Krutoholow, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said. At the head of the race are Intercept and French biotech firm Genfit, with large trials underway. Tobira, which has the deal with Allergan, is preparing to recruit patients for a final-stage study. Investors are also watching for results from two of Gilead’s mid-stage trials that are expected to be presented this year. Leading Candidates Intercept is testing Ocaliva, already approved to treat a rare liver disease called primary biliary cirrhosis, against NASH. Enrollment of a final-stage trial of 2,000 people is expected to be completed next year, with interim results due in 2019. A potential concern is that in an earlier trial some patients experienced itching when taking the drug, in some cases so severe that it interfered with basic activities. CEO Mark Pruzanski said in an interview that he hopes Ocaliva will become a backbone treatment, used in combination with other drugs. Genfit is developing elafibranor, a once-a-day-treatment that raises fat metabolism and fights inflammation, to “treat the underlying cause of fibrosis,” Dean Hum, Genfit’s chief scientific officer, said in an interview. While elafibranor failed to meet a primary goal in a mid-stage trial last year, it showed promise in a subset of patients with moderate and severe forms of the disease. A final-stage trial in 2,000 moderate and severe patients is underway, and the company may have data by late 2018.  Big Pharma Beyond the startup biotechs, some of the biggest companies are paying attention and ready to do deals. Merck said it will pay as much as $450 million for its partnership with NGM. Gilead, maker of the blockbuster hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni,  bought a NASH drug from Nimbus Therapeutics LLC for $1.2 billion, including milestone payments. Before that, Gilead also bought a drug from Phenex Pharmaceuticals AG for as much as $470 million.  Gilead now has four NASH candidates in its portfolio and will have data from two later this year. The drugs target different aspects of the disease and will be developed individually, but may be used in potent cocktails. Allergan’s Tobira is the biggest NASH deal so far, and on Tuesday the company also announced a $50 million purchase of Akarna Therapeutics Ltd., another developer of NASH treatments. Pfizer, the biggest U.S. drugmaker, may be a future acquirer. It has a NASH drug in trials and two more to be tested in humans by the end of the year. NASH is “a major priority,” said Morris Birnbaum, chief scientific officer of cardiovascular and metabolic disease. The company is trying to treat the disease in its early stages. It won’t be easy. Along with Genfit, Tobira’s mid-stage trial failed, and Raptor Pharmaceutical Corp. ended its program. “Data is starting to come out of studies, and a lot of confidence will be built and lost,” said Jay Luly, chief executive officer of Enanta Pharmaceuticals Inc., which will begin testing an experimental treatment in patients this year. “The same, I expect, will happen with money.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

But several polls have found that about 9 out of 10 Americans believe that global poverty has worsened or stayed the same over the last 20 years. Fortunately, the one point Americans agree on is dead wrong. As world leaders gathered for the U.N. General Assembly this week, all the evidence suggests we are at an inflection point for the ages. The number of people living in extreme poverty ($1.90 per person per day) has tumbled by half in two decades, and the number of small children dying has dropped by a similar proportion — that’s six million lives a year saved by vaccines, breast-feeding promotion, pneumonia medicine and diarrhea treatments! Historians may conclude that the most important thing going on in the world in the early 21st century was a stunning decline in human suffering. OK, you’re thinking that I’ve finally cracked up after spending too much time in desperate places. So, a few data points: • As recently as 1981, when I was finishing college, 44 percent of the world’s population lived in extreme poverty, according to the World Bank. Now the share is believed to be less than 10 percent and falling. “This is the best story in the world today,” says Jim Yong Kim, the bank’s president. • For the entire history of the human species until the 1960s, a majority of adults were illiterate. Now 85 percent of adults worldwide are literate and the share is rising. • Although inequality has risen in America, the global trend is more encouraging: Internationally, inequality is on the decline because of gains by the poor in places such as China and India. The United Nations aims to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030, and experts believe it’s possible. In short, on our watch, we have a decent chance of virtually wiping out ills that have plagued humanity for thousands of generations, from illiteracy to the most devastating kind of hand-to-mouth poverty. Yet the American public thinks the opposite, that poverty is getting worse. A poll released Thursday by Motivaction, a Dutch firm, found that only 1 percent of Americans surveyed realized that global extreme poverty had fallen by half over 20 years. I wonder if those of us in journalism and the humanitarian worlds don’t err by focusing so much on human misery that we leave the public with the misperception that everything is always getting worse. I’ve covered massacres in South Sudan, concentration camps in Myanmar and the widespread physical and mental stunting of children in India, but it’s also important to acknowledge the backdrop of global progress. Otherwise, the public may perceive poverty as hopeless and see no point in carrying on the fight — at just the point when we’re making the most rapid gains ever recorded. When I first made the acquaintance of the developing world, as a backpacking student in the 1980s, sometimes riding on tops of trains or buses and writing articles to pay my expenses, the most gut-wrenching aspect of poverty I encountered was ubiquitous blind beggars, robbed of dignity and of any chance to be productive. This is much less common today, partly because humanitarian aid — despite real shortcomings — has made a profound difference in health. The heroic work of former President Jimmy Carter and pharmaceutical donations from Merck have made river blindness less common. Vitamin A capsules costing 2 cents a dose have reduced blindness as well. Antibiotics have helped curb blinding trachoma. And a simple $25 surgery developed by a Nepali ophthalmologist, Sanduk Ruit, lets people suffering from cataracts see again. The scenes of blind beggars on every street corner will soon be gone forever. Cynics scoff that, if more children’s lives are saved, they will just grow up to have more babies and cause new famines and cycles of poverty. Not so! When parents are assured that their children will survive, they choose to have fewer of them. As girls are educated and contraception becomes available, birthrates tumble — just as they did in the West. Indian women now average just 2.4 births, Indonesian women 2.5 and Mexican women just 2.2. So, in a moment we can return to the many urgent needs in this world, from war to climate change to refugees. But first, let’s pause for a nanosecond of silence to acknowledge the greatest gains in human well-being in the history of our species — not to inspire complacency, but rather to spur our efforts to accelerate what may be the most important trend in the world today.

2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The global alzheimer's therapeutics market is expected to reach USD 6.4 billion in 2024, according to a new report by Grand View Research. Some primary factors driving the market growth includes rising government initiatives in order to raise awareness levels among people. Growing knowledge about the Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its high prevalence and incidence in developing economies are few of the major drivers supporting the market growth. Several governments, nonprofit, and private organizations worldwide are actively engaged in increasing people's awareness regarding progressive AD, such as Alzheimer's Association, the Alzheimer's Society of Canada, Alzheimer's Europe organization, and various other small organizations. Furthermore, the increased government funding for providing better care and support to the people with partial dementia is another important factor anticipated to enlarge market growth. For instance, organizations like Florida Department of Health, the National Institute of Health, and Alzheimer's Association in partnership with other private and government organizations provide funds to the research centers. The presence of various pipeline drugs is anticipated to provide the market with potential growth opportunities. For instance, LMTX by TauRx Pharmaceutical Ltd.; idalopirdine (Lu AE58054) by Lundbeck; crenezumab by AC Immune SA; and BAN2401 by Eisai Moreover, novel therapeutics with minimal dosage requirement has been introduced resulting in cost-effective alternatives, which is further expected to boost the market growth. For instance, Namzaric by Actavis was developed in two forms: 10 mg and 28 mg. 10 mg requires to be administered twice a day, while 28 mg requires to be administered once in a day. Further Key Findings from the Study Suggest: The cholinesterase inhibitors segment was dominant in 2013 but lost hold on the market till 2015. Patent expiry of key drugs such as Aricept, Exelon, and Razadyne was the major factor for decline in market share. Exelon transdermal patch is estimated to lose exclusivity in 2019. It is a highly prescribed drug for the treatment of mild to moderate AD, which contributed toward its revenue generation in 2015. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, on the other hand, is expected to witness a significant growth of around 16.0% over the forecast period owing to introduction of extended relase formulation of Namenda. Other drug therapies such as monocloclonal antibodies and drugs targeting Tau proteins are in being studied in latter phases of the clinical trials. Presence of a strong of pipeline drugs for target disease are attributing toward fastest growth of these drugs North America dominated the overall market in terms of revenue with share of over 33.0% in 2015, which is majorly facilitated by the availability of sophisticated healthcare facilities and infrastructure. Some key players operating in this industry are Pfizer, Inc.; Merck & Co. Inc.; Novartis AG; Eisai Co. Ltd., H. Lundbeck A/S, AC Immune; TauRx Pharmaceuticals Ltd.; Actavis plc.; Forest Laboratories; and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. Market players are expanding their product portfolio by developing and launching generic versions of drugs to sustain its market position. For instance, in 2015, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd. and Mylan launched the generic version of Namenda (Forest laboratories – Actavis).

Jerome Delay AP i NICHOLAS KRISTOF New York Times LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The world is a mess, with billions of people locked in inescapable cycles of war, famine and poverty, with more children than ever perishing from hunger, disease and violence. That’s about the only thing Americans agree on; we’re polarized about all else. But several polls have found that about 9 out of 10 Americans believe that global poverty has worsened or stayed the same over the past 20 years. Fortunately, the one point Americans agree on is dead wrong. __________ While you were sleeping … world poverty was slashed Sen. Tim Scott: It’s time to stop talking about poverty -- and listen __________ As world leaders gather for the U.N. General Assembly this week, all the evidence suggests that we are at an inflection point for the ages. The number of people living in extreme poverty ($1.90 per person per day) has tumbled by half in two decades, and the number of small children dying has dropped by a similar proportion. That’s 6 million lives a year saved by vaccines, breast-feeding promotion, pneumonia medicine and diarrhea treatments. Historians may conclude that the most important thing going on in the world in the early 21st century was a stunning decline in human suffering. OK, you’re thinking I’ve finally cracked up after spending too much time in desperate places. So a few data points: ▪ As recently as 1981, 44 percent of the world’s population lived in extreme poverty. Now the share is believed to be less than 10 percent and falling. “This is the best story in the world today,” says Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank. ▪ For the entire history of the human species until the 1960s, a majority of adults were illiterate. Now 85 percent of adults worldwide are literate, and the share is rising. ▪ Although inequality has risen in America, inequality is on the decline internationally because of gains by the poor in places like China and India. We have a decent chance of virtually wiping out ills that have plagued humanity for thousands of generations, from illiteracy to the most devastating kind of hand-to-mouth poverty. The U.N. aims to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030, and experts believe it is possible to get quite close. In short, on our watch, we have a decent chance of virtually wiping out ills that have plagued humanity for thousands of generations, from illiteracy to the most devastating kind of hand-to-mouth poverty. Yet the public thinks the opposite, that poverty is getting worse. A poll released Thursday by Motivaction, a Dutch company, finds that only 1 percent of Americans surveyed realized that global extreme poverty had fallen by half over 20 years. I wonder if those of us in journalism and the humanitarian worlds don’t err by focusing so much on human misery that we leave the public with the misperception that everything is always getting worse. I’ve covered massacres in South Sudan, concentration camps in Myanmar and widespread stunting in India, but it’s also important to acknowledge the backdrop of global progress. Otherwise, the public may perceive poverty as hopeless and see no point in carrying on the fight — at just the point when we’re making the most rapid gains ever recorded. When I first made the acquaintance of the developing world, as a backpacking law student in the 1980s, the most gut-wrenching aspect of poverty I encountered was ubiquitous blind beggars, robbed of dignity and any chance to be productive. The scenes of blind beggars on every street corner will soon be gone forever. This is much less common today, partly because humanitarian aid — despite real shortcomings — has made a profound difference in health. The heroic work of former President Jimmy Carter and pharmaceutical donations from Merck have made river blindness less common. Vitamin A capsules costing 2 cents a dose have reduced blindness as well. Antibiotics have helped curb blinding trachoma. And a simple $25 surgery developed by a Nepali ophthalmologist, Dr. Sanduk Ruit, lets people suffering from cataracts see again. The scenes of blind beggars on every street corner will soon be gone forever. Cynics scoff that if more children’s lives are saved, they will just grow up to have more babies and cause new famines and cycles of poverty. Not so. In fact, when parents are assured that their children will survive, they choose to have fewer of them. As girls are educated and contraception becomes available, birthrates tumble — just as they did in the West. Indian women now average just 2.4 births, Indonesian women 2.5, and Mexican women just 2.2. So in a moment we can return to urgent needs worldwide, from war to climate change to refugees. But first, let’s pause for a nanosecond of silence to acknowledge the greatest gains in human well-being in the history of our species — not to inspire complacency, but rather to spur our efforts to accelerate what may be the most important trend in the world today.

The licensed therapeutic programs include Ligand's aplindore program for the treatment of various CNS disorders, a CRTH2 antagonist program for the treatment of respiratory disorders, a Captisol-enabled™ acetaminophen program for pain and fever management and an H3 receptor antagonist program for the treatment of narcolepsy. Under the license agreement, Ligand is entitled to receive initial payments in equity or cash of $1.3 million upon Seelos’ completing a minimum of $7.5 million financing and up to an additional $3.5 million if Seelos becomes a public company and up to $145 million of additional cash milestones. In addition, Ligand is entitled to net sales royalties ranging from 4% to 10% for the various programs licensed. Ligand has also entered into a supply agreement for Captisol. If certain conditions are met, Ligand will provide a three-year convertible loan facility to Seelos in an amount up to $500,000. Seelos is responsible for all development activities under the license. "Seelos is assembling a great team of industry veterans to focus on a promising portfolio of mid- and late-stage programs. We are impressed with their development plans and with the outlook for building their business," said John Higgins, CEO of Ligand Pharmaceuticals. "Ligand has a track record of success with licensing foundational assets at the early stage of company formation, such as with Retrophin, Sage and Viking. All were private companies at the time of the Ligand license and all subsequently became public off lead programs licensed from Ligand. We are eager to watch Seelos progress." "We are pleased to announce the collaboration for a portfolio of CNS products with our partner Ligand Pharmaceuticals," said Dr. Raj Mehra, Chairman, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Seelos Therapeutics, Inc. "This partnership highlights Seelos' focus on developing late-stage CNS product candidates with proven mechanism of action. SLS-006, one of the lead assets acquired in this agreement, is a Phase-3 ready and clinically-validated partial dopamine agonist that is well-positioned to advance in development with a goal to provide relief to an estimated 1.5 million Parkinson's disease patients in the developed world." About Seelos Therapeutics, Inc. Seelos Therapeutics, Inc. is an emerging CNS company with late-stage clinical assets focused on neurological and psychiatric disorders, including orphan diseases. One of Seelos’ lead clinical product candidates, SLS-006 (formerly known as aplindore), is a Phase 3-ready, first-in-class, small molecule, partial dopamine agonist that has shown remarkable efficacy in early stage Parkinson's disease as a monotherapy. SLS-006 has also shown potent activity as an adjunctive therapy to highly reduced dosages of L-Dopa in late-stage Parkinson's disease. SLS-006 has been tested in more than 340 patients and has exhibited impressive efficacy similar to L-Dopa and an attractive safety profile. Seelos’ other Phase-3 ready product candidates, SLS-002 and SLS-004, have also been tested in clinical trials in more than 500 patients each and have shown promising efficacy. Seelos’ mission is to apply its clinical expertise to develop novel therapeutics to address unmet medical needs for the benefit of patients with psychiatric and movement disorders.

Credit Tobin Jones/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The world is a mess, with billions of people locked in inescapable cycles of war, famine and poverty, with more children than ever perishing from hunger, disease and violence. That’s about the only thing Americans agree on; we’re polarized about all else. But several polls have found that about 9 out of 10 Americans believe that global poverty has worsened or stayed the same over the last 20 years. Fortunately, the one point Americans agree on is dead wrong. As world leaders gather for the United Nations General Assembly this week, all the evidence suggests that we are at an inflection point for the ages. The number of people living in extreme poverty ($1.90 per person per day) has tumbled by half in two decades, and the number of small children dying has dropped by a similar proportion — that’s six million lives a year saved by vaccines, breast-feeding promotion, pneumonia medicine and diarrhea treatments! Historians may conclude that the most important thing going on in the world in the early 21st century was a stunning decline in human suffering. Photo A crowded train in Mumbai, India. Credit Rajanish Kakade/Associated Press O.K., you’re thinking that I’ve finally cracked up after spending too much time in desperate places. So a few data points: ■ As recently as 1981, when I was finishing college, 44 percent of the world’s population lived in extreme poverty, according to the World Bank. Now the share is believed to be less than 10 percent and falling. “This is the best story in the world today,” says Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank. ■ For the entire history of the human species until the 1960s, a majority of adults were illiterate. Now 85 percent of adults worldwide are literate and the share is rising. Advertisement Continue reading the main story ■ Although inequality has risen in America, the global trend is more encouraging: Internationally, inequality is on the decline because of gains by the poor in places like China and India. The U.N. aims to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030, and experts believe it is possible to get quite close. In short, on our watch, we have a decent chance of virtually wiping out ills that have plagued humanity for thousands of generations, from illiteracy to the most devastating kind of hand-to-mouth poverty. Yet the public thinks the opposite, that poverty is getting worse. A poll to be released Thursday by Motivaction, a Dutch firm, finds that only 1 percent of Americans surveyed realized that global extreme poverty had fallen by half over 20 years.

Privacy Policy I wonder if those of us in journalism and the humanitarian worlds don’t err by focusing so much on human misery that we leave the public with the misperception that everything is always getting worse. I’ve covered massacres in South Sudan, concentration camps in Myanmar and widespread stunting in India, but it’s also important to acknowledge the backdrop of global progress. Otherwise, the public may perceive poverty as hopeless and see no point in carrying on the fight — at just the point when we’re making the most rapid gains ever recorded. When I first made the acquaintance of the developing world, as a backpacking law student in the 1980s, sometimes riding on tops of trains or buses and writing articles to pay my expenses, the most gut-wrenching aspect of poverty I encountered was ubiquitous blind beggars, robbed of dignity and any chance to be productive. This is much less common today, partly because humanitarian aid — despite real shortcomings — has made a profound difference in health. The heroic work of former President Jimmy Carter and pharmaceutical donations from Merck have made river blindness less common. Vitamin A capsules costing 2 cents a dose have reduced blindness as well. Antibiotics have helped curb blinding trachoma. And a simple $25 surgery developed by a Nepali ophthalmologist, Dr. Sanduk Ruit, lets people suffering from cataracts see again. The scenes of blind beggars on every street corner will soon be gone forever. Cynics scoff that if more children’s lives are saved, they will just grow up to have more babies and cause new famines and cycles of poverty. Not so! In fact, when parents are assured that their children will survive, they choose to have fewer of them. As girls are educated and contraception becomes available, birthrates tumble — just as they did in the West. Indian women now average just 2.4 births, Indonesian women 2.5, and Mexican women just 2.2. So in a moment we can return to urgent needs worldwide, from war to climate change to refugees. But first, let’s pause for a nanosecond of silence to acknowledge the greatest gains in human well-being in the history of our species — not to inspire complacency, but rather to spur our efforts to accelerate what may be the most important trend in the world today.

Still reeling from EpiPen scandal, nurse questions new drug’s sky-high cost Lee Rood , lrood@dmreg.com 6:30 p.m. CDT September 21, 2016 Patricia Karraker suffers from a rare condition. But one prescription that could help her can cost more than $11,000. Buy Photo Patricia Karraker sits with her daughter, Susan Piper. Karraker has a rare condition affecting her blood pressure and can't get approved for the drug to treat it because of the drug's high cost. (Photo: Lee Rood/The Register)Buy Photo Patricia Karraker suffers from a rare condition that causes her blood pressure to drop precipitously when she sits up or stands. It falls so fast, she can pass out — and that’s been happening more and more often. She's been hospitalized twice in the past month. “It’s awful. I can’t function,” the 82-year-old says. “I’m not productive, and I am a woman who is used to being productive.” Last week, three Iowa Clinic doctors treating Karraker at Methodist West Hospital in West Des Moines wanted to try Northera, a drug approved for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension by the FDA two years ago. But Susan Piper, Karraker’s daughter and who happens to be a nurse and the wife of a neurosurgeon, said she was told a top Unity Point Health official rejected the drug because of its high cost. Pharmacies sell 180-count 300 mg capsules of the drug for around $11,218 to $11,535 — and that's with discount coupons. “I could put her up in Buckingham Palace for that,” Piper said. Karraker has largely outlived her retirement savings, so she lives now with Piper, 52, and her son-in-law in West Des Moines. The Pipers help with the costs of her medications because she doesn’t have supplemental prescription drug insurance. Piper wrote the Reader’s Watchdog, wanting to know why a life-saving drug costs so much. She feared her mother would be put at risk if she couldn't get the drug before she was released. “Society needs to understand that these costs don't begin and end with EpiPen,” she wrote. Price gouging or drug development? We have Martin Shkreli, the hedge fund manager turned drug company CEO, to thank for fanning the recent national outrage over prescription price gouging. Americans have been fuming ever since Turing Pharmaceuticals obtained exclusive rights to Daraprim, the drug used to treat HIV and AIDS patients, and hiked prices 5,000 percent. Next came the skyrocketing price of EpiPen, a branded device that quickly delivers epinephrine, a cheap and commonly available chemical compound. For years, it's helped people with life-threatening allergies, such as bee or wasp stings. After pharma giant Mylan bought EpiPen, the company began to quietly raise prices from less than $100 in 2009 to around $600 this year. Those increases started at 10 percent from 2010 to 2013, then jumped to 15 percent beginning in 2014, according to Time magazine. USA TODAY Mylan CEO defends price boosts for lifesaving EpiPen The reason the company could get away with those bumps: One generic alternative didn't pass muster with the FDA and another competitor, Auvi-Q, was recalled. After all the public backlash this year, Mylan rolled out a generic two-pack of EpiPen for commercially insured patients for $300. And it announced other measures to help make the drug appear more accessible. But critics are still howling that consumers and insurers are being forced to pay too much because the maker has a de facto corner on the market. Price hikes reasons differ But what happened with Daraprim or EpiPen is different than what’s happening with Northera right now. The development costs of the first two drugs were covered years ago. Northera is an orphan drug, which means it treats a rare disease that affects fewer than 200,000 Americans. As such, it qualifies for incentives under the Orphan Drug Act, including a minimum of seven years of market exclusivity for its manufacturer. The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 encouraged drug manufacturers to develop new drugs for such rare disorders, and it is widely considered a success. Only 10 drugs had been approved to treat a rare disease before its passage. By the end of 2015, over 450 additional new ones had been approved, according new research released this year. But specialty drug companies also have been taking advantage of the law, increasing prices dramatically. For them, the beauty is that the high cost is usually covered by public or private insurers because they are the only drugs available. USA TODAY Under fire, Mylan to offer generic EpiPen for 50% less Denmark-based Lundbeck, which acquired Northera in the U.S., has been accused of price gouging after cornering a market. Example: When Merck owned a drug used to treat a heart condition in premature infants called Indocin IV, it charged $77.77 per treatment. Lundbeck bought the U.S. rights to that drug in 2005. Then it acquired rights to a similar drug called NeoProfen in 2006. Immediately after, the company raised the price to Indocin IV to about $500 a vial. When the company launched NeoProfen, it set the price at about $483 per vial. The result was a lawsuit by the Federal Trade Commission and Minnesota for violations of anti-monopoly laws. But the FTC lost because it didn’t prove the two drugs were in direct competition. This month, the General Court of the European Union upheld an antitrust fine imposed against Lundbeck and several other drug makers for allegedly conspiring to delay the availability of a lower-cost generic version of an antidepressant. The so-called pay-to-delay deal violated the EU’s anti-competition regulations. Lundbeck was ordered to pay the bulk of the fine, or about $105 million. But Lundbeck can make the case that research and development of Northera in the U.S. is still costing millions. In 2012, health regulators recommended Northera — first used in Japan — not be approved in the U.S. because of safety concerns. But in 2014, Chelsea Therapeutics won approval for the short-term relief of symptoms like Karraker experiences. Lundbeck, a company that has expertise in commercializing such drugs, bought Chelsea. The company had to commit to investing millions more in clinical trials for the FDA's approval. Company: We'll work with patients Sally Benjamin Young, vice president for public affairs for Lundbeck, says the drug is currently being used by only about 5,000 people in the U.S. Most pay less than $100 a month after insurance, she said. The company also invests in services and support for families, like the Northera Support Center. “If they identify coverage gaps, they would work with patients and the family,” Young said of the center. “We want to make sure the burden isn’t on the patient, so they can get the treatment they need.” Young said Lundbeck is different than other companies like Mylan, focusing its research and development on hard-to-treat central nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, major depression and schizophrenia. Those drugs generally cost $100 million more than other drugs to test and bring to market, while their chances of success are considerably lower, she said. In the U.S., Northera carries a black-box warning to physicians indicating its use might increase the risk of hypertension while lying down. Dr. Kevin Cunningham, Karraker's primary physician, declined to comment. But this week, he opted against Northera for fear the drug might push Karraker's blood pressure too high, Piper said, he feared her mother might have a stroke. Instead, he decided to increase her dosage of her cortisol drug and recommended she be admitted to a skilled nursing facility for the time being. “I feel better about this as an option,” Piper said. “Last week, they told me she didn’t meet criteria for skilled care.” Piper said people still need to question why drugs cost so much. “Even though we decided not to give this to my mom, it will come up for someone else. Medication costs in this country are nuts.” Young said she believes the doctor knows what's best for Karraker. But if it's decided she does need Northera again, she said she would personally help her family get assistance. 51 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/2dkGAoO TOP VIDEOS How good are Iowa's rivers?

The VA requires drug makers offer the agency a discount amounting to 24 percent off a drug's average price.  The Yes on 61 campaign is facing off with opponents that include the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and drug makers, including Pfizer, Merck and Gilead. They argue that passage of the ballot initiative would result in higher prescription drug costs for the state and would reduce patient access to medications.  Salazar says says so far, the yes campaign has raised about $10 million, but says that budget will be small compared to the drug makers' campaign war chest. "We understand the other side is going to spend tens of millions of dollars on this campaign," he says,  adding that community-support for the measure will be key. "We’re not going to be able to bombard the airwaves like the pharmaceutical industry is going to, so we have to get our message across people-to-people. This is going to be a real grassroots effort - a little bit like David and Goliath."  Other supporters of the initiative, beyond Sen. Bernie Sanders, include the California Nurses Association, AARP, Inc., VoteVets and the Urban League, he said. A recent USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll shows 66 percent of California voters are in favor of the initiative, 23 percent are opposed to it, and 12 percent are undecided.

Health care and household goods companies led the way while energy companies slipped. Major market indexes were higher all day, but returned most of those gains at the close of trading. They rose just enough cancel out Monday’s small losses. Drug companies helped health care stocks make some modest gains, while Exxon Mobil fell on reports it’s being investigated by securities regulators. Bond yields slipped and the dollar was little changed as investors waited decisions from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. Since investors doubt the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates Wednesday, they may focus instead on the Fed’s statement and a press conference led by Fed Chair Janet Yellen. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 9.79 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,129.96. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index added 0.64 points to 2,139.76. The Nasdaq composite picked up 6.33 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,241.35. On the New York Stock Exchange, more stocks fell than rose. That was the reverse of Monday, when major indexes fell but more stocks were up than down. Tuesday was the start of two-day meetings for the Fed and Bank of Japan. While investors didn’t expect an increase in U.S. interest rates, the Japanese central bank is expected to take new steps to boost the nation’s ailing economy. That could include an increase in its stimulus program or a further cut in the deposit rate as a way to encourage banks to lend money. Gilead Sciences gained $2.79, or 3.5 percent, to $81.78 after the hepatitis C drugmaker completed a $5 billion debt offering. Gilead said it may use the cash to make a deal, and Jefferies & Co. analyst Brian Abrahams said he thinks the company is getting close to at least one acquisition. Elsewhere, Merck rose 61 cents, or 1 percent, to $61.94. Ascena Retail Group, the parent of Ann Taylor, Lane Bryant and Dress Barn, dropped to a six-year low after the company reported weak quarterly results and gave a forecast that fell short of investor expectations. Ascena bought Ann Taylor a year ago and also struggled with discounts from competitors and shaky demand. Its stock lost $2.43, or 29.9 percent, to $5.69. Allergan announced yet another acquisition as it agreed to buy Tobira Therapeutics. Tobira is studying drugs that treat symptoms of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, a disease that triggers inflammation that can lead to cirrhosis, cancer and liver failure. The Commerce Department said the pace of home construction slowed down in August as fewer homes were built in the South. Monthly housing figures can be volatile and housing starts have grown this year, but the report hurt shares of homebuilders. PulteGroup gave up 58 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $19.29 and Lennar, which reported strong quarterly results, shed $1.59, or 3.5 percent, to $43.50. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 1.69 percent from 1.71 percent. The dollar rose to 101.84 yen from 101.81 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1157 from $1.1178. Benchmark U.S. crude picked up 14 cents to $43.44 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 7 cents to $45.88 a barrel in London. Exxon Mobil lost $1.29, or 1.5 percent, to $82.54 after Dow Jones reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Exxon’s accounting practices and other issues. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline sank 6 cents, or 4 percent, to $1.36 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.41 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 11 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $3.05 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold gained 40 cents to $1,318.20 an ounce. Silver lost 1 cent to $19.28 an ounce. Copper added 1 cent to $2.17 a pound. France’s CAC 40 slipped 0.1 percent while Germany’s DAX rose 0.2 percent. In Britain, the FTSE 100 index was 0.3 percent higher. Tokyo’s benchmark Nikkei 225 closed down 0.2 percent and South Korea’s Kospi added 0.5 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong dipped 0.1 percent.

Be aware that this effect did not translate into better patient survival. Patients getting cangrelor (Kengreal) before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) had good outcomes whether they had stable angina or acute coronary syndrome (ACS), according to a sub-analysis of CHAMPION PHOENIX in which the drug was compared to clopidogrel (Plavix). Rates of a composite endpoint of death, myocardial infarction (MI), ischemia-driven revascularization, and stent thrombosis at 48 hours were lower for patients receiving cangrelor who had stable angina (5.7% versus 6.8% for clopidogrel, OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.67-1.01) as well as in those with ACS (3.3% versus 4.6%, OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.96). Similarly, cangrelor trended towards lower rates of stent thrombosis alone in both patients with stable angina (0.5% versus 0.9%, OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30-1.01) and those with ACS (1.3% versus 2.0%, OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.42-1.06), reported P. Gabriel Steg, MD, of Hôpital Bichat in Paris, and colleagues in JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions. "The benefits and risks of cangrelor were consistent in patients with stable angina and ACS," they concluded. "Regardless of the setting, primary PCI for ST-elevation MI, non-ST-elevation ACS, or elective PCI for stable angina, cangrelor provides added flexibility to clinicians by ensuring an immediate, consistent, and reversible antiplatelet effect and obviating the need to commit to pretreatment." "Cangrelor as compared with clopidogrel given at the time of PCI consistently reduced the risk of periprocedural ischemic events in both ACS and stable angina patients. These results are mostly driven by a decrease in periprocedural MI, but the key secondary endpoint of stent thrombosis was also reduced in both groups." Cangrelor and clopidogrel were about equal in terms of moderate or severe bleeding -- per Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries definitions: Stable angina: 0.5% cangrelor versus 0.3% clopidogrel, OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.67-3.33 ACS: 0.7% versus 0.4%, OR 1.79, 95% CI 0.79-4.07 Moreover, "cangrelor has not shown any insinuation of an effect on mortality linked to PCI in comparison with clopidogrel, despite a significant number of patients enrolled," according to Gilles Montalescot, MD, PhD, of Pitié-Salpêtrière University Hospital in Paris, and two colleagues representing the ACTION Study Group. "There is a strong argument in favor of cangrelor to better control the troponin leak following PCI but no evidence that the drug can improve survival of the patients," they wrote in an accompanying editorial. "The seductive antiplatelet drug has shown so far, to fix the troponin leak but not the life of the patients." Even so, Montalescot's group commented that cangrelor reduces stent thrombosis -- and "because of its intravenous formulation and fast onset of action, is the only P2Y12 antagonist adapted to emergency and high-risk situations when patients cannot swallow or absorb other P2Y12 antagonist pills." "Shock patients, cardiac arrest patients, and ventilated patients with ongoing ST-segment elevation MI are those who need life-saving drugs at the time of PCI. Unfortunately, they are also those who were excluded from the three CHAMPION trials and those the company refused to evaluate so far in new studies," they continued. "Considering the safety hazard of pre-treatment with oral P2Y12 antagonists in stable CAD and non-ST-segment elevation-ACS patients, and considering the ease of use and good safety profile of cangrelor, the drug could at least fix the life of the interventional cardiologist!" Steg's modified intention-to-treat population of CHAMPION PHOENIX included 6,358 patients with stable angina and 4,584 with an acute coronary syndrome. Patients were randomized to cangrelor or clopidogrel before PCI. ACS patients tended to be younger and were more likely to smoke and be men. Though they had more multivessel disease, they had less prior history of MI, peripheral artery disease, heart failure, diabetes, previous PCI, or coronary artery bypass grafting than their peers with stable angina. In addition, the ACS group was more likely to undergo femoral access and receive clopidogrel on or before PCI; the stable angina cohort received more drug-eluting stents, however. The present CHAMPION PHOENIX substudy was not as well-powered as the main analysis, Steg's group acknowledged, adding that periprocedural myocardial infarction was likely underestimated due to the difficulty in discerning events. "Intriguingly, the rate of ischemic events is higher in the stable coronary artery disease (CAD) population than in the ACS patients (6.3% versus 3.9%)," Montalescot and colleagues noted. "Obviously, it does not mean that stable CAD patients have a worse prognosis than ACS patients. This disconnect finds its explanation in the definitions used to adjudicate ischemic events .... The definitions of periprocedural MI were not the same for ACS and stable CAD patients." "The safety profile of cangrelor is reassuring, although the safety profile of the CHAMPION PHOENIX trial population is so low that any difference would be difficult to detect," the editorialists added. "In addition to the selection of patients, the delayed administration of clopidogrel in both groups may partly explain the unusually low bleeding event rates observed in the CHAMPION PHOENIX trial."

Note that the study suggests that concerns about differential infection risks may not need to influence physician choice between mycophenolate versus azathioprine and mycophenolate versus cyclophosphamide. Rates of serious infection and mortality among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) did not depend on the immunosuppressive drug regimen they were on, investigators reported. In a study of propensity score-matched pairs of patients, rates of serious infection and mortality didn't change whether SLE patients were new users of mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept), azathioprine, or cyclophosphamide, wrote Candace H. Feldman, MD, MPH, of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, and colleagues, in Arthritis & Rheumatology. It's well known that patients with SLE face an increased risk of developing serious infections that could lead to hospitalizations and even death. But uncertainty exists as to whether infection rates differ according to the various immunosuppressive drug regimens SLE patients undergo, Feldman's groups pointed out. The authors used insurance claims data from the Medicaid Analytic eXtract database for Medicaid enrollees to assess whether there were differences in the rates of serious infection among SLE patient initiating mycophenolate (CellCept) compared with azathioprine, as well as those initiating mycophenolate compared with cyclophosphamide. These agents were selected for study because they are the most commonly used medications for treating moderate-to-severe SLE (other than hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids) and are often used interchangeably. Feldman and her colleagues studied 1,350 propensity score-matched pairs of patients in whom mycophenolate and azathioprine treatments had been newly initiated, as well as 674 pairs of mycophenolate and cyclophosphamide patients. They estimated propensity scores for the patients receiving mycophenolate versus those receiving azathioprine, as well as those receiving mycophenolate versus cyclophosphamide, based on sociodemographic, comorbidity, and medication use information. For both drug comparisons, they determined rates of first serious infection as well as all-cause mortality over 6- and 12-month periods. First serious infection was defined as a hospital discharge diagnosis ICD-9 code for bacterial infection, as well as fungal, viral, and mycobacterial infections. For the mycophenolate/azathioprine comparison, the 6-month intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis determined that the incident rate of first hospitalized infection per 100 person-years was 14.6 (95% CI 11.6-17.6) among mycophenolate new users and 15.2 (95% CI 12.9-18.3) among azathioprine new users. More than 90% of the infections in both treatment groups were bacterial and there was no significant difference in time to infection. Additionally, there was no significant difference in infection rates in the 12-month ITT analysis. As for the mycophenolate/cyclophosphamide group, a 6-month ITT analysis comparing the two found that the incident rates of first hospitalized infection per 100 person-years were 24.1 (95% CI 18.6-29.7) among new mycophenolate users and 24.6 (95% CI 19.0-30.2) among new cyclophosphamide users. As with the mycophenolate/azathioprine comparison group, over 90% of infections were bacterial, and there were no significant differences in infection rates in the 12-month ITT analysis. While the researchers observed no differences in serious infection rates based on their analyses, "we found high rates of serious infections associated with use of all three of the immunosuppressive medications examined." Therefore, they suggested that "the high burden of serious infections among SLE patients receiving these medications overall is important to consider." This study has the potential to help physicians guide clinical decisions concerning these three drugs, Feldman's group concluded, adding that their findings suggest that "concerns about differential infection risks may not need to influence physician and patient choice between mycophenolate versus azathioprine and mycophenolate versus cyclophosphamide, even in a population highly susceptible to adverse outcomes." While the study was the largest head-to-head population-based comparative effectiveness study examining this subject, the authors wrote, "it lacks power to examine specific infection subtypes, as well as the effect of immunosuppressive dosages on these rates." They also pointed out that while the study compared risk of infection in the short term, further study is needed to analyze the risk associated with long-term use of these medications. The study was funded by the Lupus Foundation and the NIH. Feldman disclosed funding from the Rheumatology Research Foundation Investigator Award. She disclosed relevant relationships with Pfizer and Merck/EMD Serono. Co-authors disclosed relevant relationships with Pfizer, Merck, Amgen, Bayer, Keryx, Medtronic, Mitsubishi-Tanabe, Rockwell, Aetion, PCORI, and ACUMEN.
