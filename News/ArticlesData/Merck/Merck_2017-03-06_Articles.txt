Merck and Pfizer Announce U.S. FDA and EMA Filing Acceptances of Three Marketing Applications for Ertugliflozin-Containing Medicines for Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Investigational SGLT2 Inhibitor Submitted as Monotherapy and in Fixed-Dose Combinations with JANUVIA® (sitagliptin) or Metformin Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Small Preview Thumbnail March 06, 2017 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time KENILWORTH, N.J. & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:FE), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review three New Drug Applications (NDAs) for medicines containing ertugliflozin, an investigational SGLT2 inhibitor in development to help improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes: one for monotherapy, one for the fixed-dose combination of ertugliflozin and JANUVIA® (sitagliptin), and one for the fixed-dose combination of ertugliflozin and metformin. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date from the FDA is in December 2017 for the three NDAs. Additionally, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has validated for review three Marketing Authorization Applications (MAAs) for ertugliflozin monotherapy and the two fixed-dose combination products. These marketing applications to the FDA and EMA are supported by studies in the VERTIS clinical development program of ertugliflozin, including VERTIS MONO, VERTIS FACTORIAL, and VERTIS SITA2, which were first presented at medical congresses in 2016. The full VERTIS clinical development program is comprised of nine Phase 3 trials in approximately 12,600 adults with type 2 diabetes. “The acceptance of the three applications by both the FDA and EMA represents an important milestone in the progression of our collaboration with Pfizer on ertugliflozin, and reflects Merck’s commitment to advancing new treatment options for people with type 2 diabetes around the world,” said Sam Engel, M.D., associate vice president, Merck clinical research, diabetes and endocrinology. “If approved, we believe ertugliflozin will be an important option for many patients and a welcome addition to our already strong type 2 diabetes portfolio, with our DPP-4 inhibitor JANUVIA as the foundation.” “Because type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease, patients may need multiple treatment options to help them manage their condition. That is why we are proud of the comprehensive VERTIS clinical development program, and we look forward to working closely with the FDA and EMA in an effort to bring these three additional treatment options to adults with type 2 diabetes,” said James Rusnak, M.D., Ph.D., chief development officer, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, Pfizer Global Product Development. Important Information about JANUVIA® (sitagliptin) 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg tablets JANUVIA is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. JANUVIA should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. JANUVIA has not been studied in patients with a history of pancreatitis. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk of developing pancreatitis while taking JANUVIA. Selected Important Risk Information about JANUVIA® JANUVIA is contraindicated in patients with a history of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to sitagliptin, such as anaphylaxis or angioedema. There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and nonfatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking JANUVIA. After initiating JANUVIA, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue JANUVIA and initiate appropriate management. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk of developing pancreatitis while taking JANUVIA. Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiating JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. A dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal insufficiency and in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Caution should be used to ensure that the correct dose of JANUVIA is prescribed. There have been postmarketing reports of worsening renal function, including acute renal failure, sometimes requiring dialysis. A subset of these reports involved patients with renal insufficiency, some of whom were prescribed inappropriate doses of sitagliptin. When JANUVIA was used in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, medications known to cause hypoglycemia, the incidence of hypoglycemia was increased over that of placebo. Therefore, a lower dose of sulfonylurea or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. The incidence (and rate) of hypoglycemia based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia were: 12.2% (0.59 episodes/patient-year) for JANUVIA 100 mg in combination with glimepiride (with or without metformin), 1.8% (0.24 episodes/patient-year) for placebo in combination with glimepiride (with or without metformin), 15.5% (1.06 episodes/patient-year) for JANUVIA 100 mg in combination with insulin (with or without metformin), and 7.8% (0.51 episodes/patient-year) for placebo in combination with insulin (with or without metformin). There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA, such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens –Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with JANUVIA, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue JANUVIA, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. Angioedema has also been reported with other dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema with another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with JANUVIA. There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from 1 day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving JANUVIA. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, JANUVIA should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment. There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with JANUVIA or with any other antidiabetic drug. In clinical studies, the adverse reactions reported, regardless of investigator assessment of causality, in ≥5% of patients treated with JANUVIA as monotherapy and in combination therapy and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo, were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, and headache.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 6 March 2017 by Military News ABLYNX’S PARTNER, MERCK KGaA, HAS PRESENTED NEW DATA FROM A PHASE Ib PSORIASIS STUDY OF THE BI-SPECIFIC ANTI-IL-17A/F NANOBODY AT THE ANNUAL AAD CONFERENCE All patients in the highest dose group achieved 90% skin clearance (PASI 90) compared to 0% for placebo Skin biopsy showed complete reversal of disease pathology in the majority of patients in the high dose group The onset of clinical effect was rapid and sustained throughout the study Favourable safety and tolerability profile across all doses tested GHENT, Belgium, 6 March 2017 – Ablynx [Euronext Brussels: ABLX; OTC: ABYLY] today announced that its partner, Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany), has presented new data from a Phase Ib study demonstrating strong efficacy with the bi-specific anti-IL-17A/F Nanobody® (M1095; ALX-0761) in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. The results were presented at the 75th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology Conference, taking place from 3-7 March 2017, in Orlando, Florida. The Phase Ib study was a multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in 41 patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of multiple ascending doses of M1095, ranging from 30mg to 240mg administered subcutaneously on days 1, 15 and 29. The study also evaluated pharmacokinetic profiles and efficacy of multiple subcutaneous doses of M1095. A reduction in disease activity, as measured by the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) and improvement in static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) was seen for all doses of M1095 versus 0% for placebo. At day 85, all patients treated with 240mg M1095 experienced a 75% reduction in disease activity (PASI 75) and had clear or almost clear skin (PASI 90); moreover, 56% of patients in this highest dose group had clear skin (PASI 100). In addition, rapid onset of clinical effect was observed after the first administered dose and sustained through to completion of the study at day 85. M1095 had a favourable safety and tolerability profile, with no treatment-related serious adverse events reported and no dose-dependent increase in frequency or severity of adverse events. There was no apparent effect of anti-drug antibodies on pharmacokinetics. The presentation ‚Safety and efficacy of multiple ascending doses of subcutaneous M1095, an anti-interleukin-17A/F bi-specific Nanobody®, in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis’ is available on the Ablynx website under R&D portfolio. Dr Edwin Moses, CEO of Ablynx, commented: „This Nanobody was developed as part of a deal we signed with Merck KGaA in 2008 and was the first functional bi-specific Nanobody to reach the clinic. We were responsible for the discovery and some of the pre-clinical work and Merck KGaA is now responsible for the clinical development and commercialisation of this drug candidate. These initial clinical data are very encouraging compared to other psoriasis therapeutics commercially available, and in development. We believe that the results are a further validation of the enormous potential of the Nanobody platform to generate differentiating multi-specific drug candidates for the treatment of a wide range of diseases.” About M1095 (anti-IL-17A/F) The interleukin (IL)-17A/F bispecific Nanobody neutralizes the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17A and IL-17F, which are each expressed at inflammatory sites, and have both been implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and several auto-immune disorders. The interleukin-17 (IL-17) family of cytokines includes six IL-17-family ligands, and five receptors. IL-17A is the most studied family member and most often mentioned as IL-17. IL-17F is the closest relative to IL-17A based on sequence and receptor binding. Indeed, while both IL-17A and IL-17F exist as homodimers, an IL-17A/F heterodimer has also been described. In addition, both IL-17F and IL-17A bind the IL-17RA and IL-17RC receptors. A difference between IL-17A and IL-17F is that their expression may be differentially regulated at both the cell-type and transcriptional levels accounting for non-redundant roles in vivo. IL-17A and IL-17F are important mediators of local and systemic inflammation. Their activities are often additive or synergistic to that of other inflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF). This described biology of IL-17A and IL-17F supports a role for both cytokines in the initiation and perpetuation of Th17-associated chronic auto-immune and inflammatory diseases and in subsequent organ damage. The bi-specific anti-IL-17A/F Nanobody (M1095) was discovered by Ablynx. Merck KGaA is now responsible for the clinical development and commercialisation of M1095 with Ablynx set to potentially receive milestones and royalties as the programme progresses. About the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) is the most widely used tool for the measurement of severity of psoriasis. It assesses treatment efficacy by measuring the reduction in redness, scaling and thickness of psoriatic plaques and the extent of involvement in each region of the body. PASI combines the assessment of the severity of lesions and the area affected into a single score. PASI is widely used in clinical trials of therapies to treat psoriasis. Although absolute PASI score is often used to define entry into a trial, it is response to treatment that is important to measure efficacy and outcomes. This is usually presented as a percentage response rate; e.g. PASI 50, PASI 75, PASI 90, PASI 100. PASI 75, for example, represents the percentage (or number) of patients who have achieved a 75% or more reduction in their PASI score from baseline. PASI 100 indicates patients who have achieved a complete resolution of all disease. About static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) A key measure used in clinical trials of psoriasis is the physician global assessment (PGA). Global assessments can be done for extensive disease as well as localized plaques. The static PGA measures the physician’s impression of the disease at a single point. The static Physician’s Global Assessment (sPGA) scale rates the investigator’s overall clinical assessment of a subjects plaque thickness, erythema, and scaling on a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear, except for residual discoloration) to 5 (majority of plaques have severe thickness, erythema, and scale). To assign a sPGA score, the investigator examines all psoriatic lesions and assigns a severity score ranging from 0 to 5 for thickness, erythema, and scaling. Scores for thickness, erythema, and scaling are summed and the mean of these 3 scores equals the overall sPGA score. Overall sPGA scores range from 0 to 5, where lower scores indicate clinical improvement. In this study, the percentage of subjects who achieved a sPGA rating of 0 (clear) or 1 (minimal) and had at least a 2 level reduction from baseline score were reported.

Despite the failure of a major clinical trial, there is still hope for sufferers of Alzheimer's Credit:  ZEPHYR/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Victoria Lambert 6 March 2017 • 7:00am When scientists at Merck announced last week that they were putting an end to late-stage trials of their latest Alzheimer’s drug, it wasn’t just patients and families that were devastated. With verubecestat, a once-promising therapy, declared as having no positive effect, its failure set alarm bells ringing across the entire drug research community. This was the second Alzheimer’s treatment trial to be cancelled in short order. In November, solanezumab – an injectable therapy from US pharma giant Eli Lilly, also aimed at mild to moderate forms of Alzheimer’s – had been halted in late-stage trials. Bart De Strooper, director of the new £250m Dementia Research Institute at University College London, has warned that researchers must change the way they think about the disease in response to the lack of progress. This was the second Alzheimer’s treatment trial to be cancelled in the last 6 months Credit:  Slater King “Researchers have had too simplistic an approach to dementia,” he said. “What is emerging is that these brain diseases are highly complex, with many processes, not just one. We need to make our research more nuanced.” Solanezumab and verubecestat both affect the build-up of amyloid proteins which turn into sticky clumps of plaque, found in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. Verubecestat belongs to a class of drugs called BACE inhibitors, which interfere with the production of Beta-secretase 1, an enzyme known as BACE1, while solanezumab is a monoclonal antibody designed to clear away amyloid. For years, these proteins have been the focus of researchers desperate to find a way to stop the progression of the illness. Indeed, there is still an ongoing trial into a drug called AZD3293, a collaboration between AstraZeneca and Eli Lilly, not due to end until May 2019. But do these public failures mean that scientists have been looking in the wrong place all along? Are we at crisis point for research into Alzheimer’s? A brain scan of someone with Alzheimer's disease. Blue and black areas indicate low brain activity Credit: DR ROBERT FRIEDLAND/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY The news about Merck’s failed therapy is certainly disappointing, says Dr Rosa Sancho, Head of Research at Alzheimer’s Research UK – especially, she points out, for those affected by dementia involved in the trial itself. “We’re waiting to hear from Merck once they have analysed their data fully to see what we can learn from this setback.” But she insists, the situation is not without its positives. The principal lesson learned from the trials, says Dr Sancho, is that amyloid plaques are building up many years before the symptoms of dementia start to show. “Probably what has happened is that by the time patients got the Merck drug, it was already too late.” Rudolph Tanzi, Vice-Chair of Neurology and Director of the Genetics and Aging Research Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in the US, agrees: “The failure of the BACE inhibitor at Merck is further proof that targeting amyloid plaques after clinical symptoms arise is too late. “Amyloid plaques trigger the disease a decade or so before symptoms. Successfully treating this disease will require early detection of plaque in the brain by imaging, followed by amyloid lowering drugs, long before symptoms arise.” He offers a familiar analogy. “It would be like using cholesterol-lowering drugs long before symptoms of congestive heart failure, back when the earliest signs of coronary artery disease or even high cholesterol levels are detected.” Dementia without drugs | Five ways to reduce your risk Dr Sancho adds: “We have to change our thinking – we have to start treatment earlier.” She points out that verubecestat may yet be useful. Another trial is underway on people without dementia but who are experiencing memory loss and thinking problems. “There is a chance those people will benefit more.” Consultant neuroradiologist Dr Emer MacSweeney, CEO and Medical Director at Re:Cognition Health, isn’t writing off BACE inhibitors just yet, either. “For the Merck study, patients were not pre-screened for amyloid positivity before entering the trial. “Positive amyloid status can be demonstrated using a new brain-imaging technique or spinal fluid analysis and is now the recognised hallmark for Alzheimer’s disease. New clinical trials for similar medications have been able to use the new diagnostic test for amyloid protein and select only those individuals proven to be amyloid positive. These studies are ongoing and there is cautious optimism, although results are not available yet.” Of course, Alzheimer’s is not the first or only disease to have proven so difficult. Professor Jackie Hunter, CEO of BenevolentBio, the bioscience division of BenevolentAI, points to work on multiple sclerosis (MS). “A couple of decades ago, therapies were limited and many new interventions failed. However, they enabled new research and better understanding of the disease, which in turn led to new and more effective therapies for MS.” She says: “Oncology has the highest rate of failure in terms of new therapy trials, but no one says we should stop work on trying to find a cure for cancers.” Watch | The difference between dementia and Alzheimers – in 60 seconds 01:06 Already, there are other promising drugs coming through, including agents that target inflammation and other changes in the brain. According to Dr McSweeney, “there is no reason to believe we are at a crisis. More time, energy and funding is being directed into new drug development for Alzheimer’s than ever before. “These medications are not just designed to slow progression of symptoms (disease modifying drugs), but also to boost memory and other cognitive function (symptomatic drugs). Symptomatic drugs help the dying brain cells to work more effectively, whereas disease modifying drugs are aimed to stop, or significantly slow down, the death of brain cells in the first instance.” One last but significant positive to emerge from Eli Lilly’s trial is attitudinal – and could be influential. Not only was the company open about its test failures, but representatives agreed to speak at a symposium called by Alzheimer’s Research UK, where they showed all of the data and allowed discussion about what the next steps could be. Dr Sancho hopes other drug developers will follow Eli Lilly’s lead, and share results with the dementia research community. “We’re seeing more discussion around what happened and hope this will continue,” she says. “Dementia is a such a pressing challenge in society. It wouldn’t make sense not to take and share as much as we can from the data.” Follow Telegraph Health & Fitness READ MORE ABOUT: Therapy Multiple Sclerosis Health Cholesterol Hospitals Dementia Brain disease Cancer Genetics Drugs AstraZeneca Memory Show more Wellbeing latest 06 Mar 2017, 8:00pm Broken your Lent promises already?

Now an executive says the company can’t cut the product’s price because middlemen who manage drug benefits would refuse to cover it. “If we just lowered the cost of Sovaldi from $85,000 to $50,000, every payer would rip up our contract,” said Jim Meyers, executive vice president of worldwide commercial operations, in an interview with Bloomberg News. Pharmacy benefit managers such as Express Scripts Holding Co. and CVS Health Corp. negotiate drug reimbursement, often in secrecy, for employers and health plans. While PBMs say they deliver lower prices for customers and patients, drugmakers have begun aggressively implicating the middlemen in high medication costs that have become a frequent target of Washington lawmakers and President Donald Trump. One of the functions of PBMs is to help insurers decide which drugs to cover for their customers, and how much to reimburse manufacturers. Manufacturers use rebates to ensure they get on PBMs’ lists of covered drugs, called formularies, and the middlemen often take a cut of those rebates, often about 10 percent, for themselves before passing the rest of the savings to the insurers. Now, pharmaceutical companies are charging that PBMs prefer higher list prices, because the middlemen want to sustain their own revenues. <a href="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/click/zone?zid=1&pid=0&lookup=true&position=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> <img src="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/view/banner/image/zone?zid=1&pid=0&position=1" height="60" width="468" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Click Here!"> </a> “I have never met, in this entire experience, a PBM or a payer outside of the Medicaid segment that preferred a price of $50,000 over $75,000 and a rebate back to them,” Meyers said in the interview. Declining share Express Scripts spokesman Brian Henry said PBMs are needed “because employers and health plans want to have some way to push back against drugmakers who continually raise their prices." Drugmakers sponsored a study released in January finding manufacturers of branded drugs are getting a declining share of total U.S. spending on their products, in part because of an increase in secret rebates paid to middlemen including PBMs. Gilead’s Sovaldi shocked the health-care system after it was approved in December 2013. Priced at $84,000 for a three-month regimen, or $1,000 a pill, it was slammed by payers, politicians and the public. At the time, the Foster City, California-based company hunkered down and tried to deflect the scrutiny. Now it’s time for the PBMs to get their turn in the spotlight, Meyers said. “We have a system that’s incentivized upon rebate revenue,” he said, adding that Merck & Co.’s experience with its Zepatier, a rival drug to Sovaldi and Gilead’s successor drug Harvoni, that entered the market in 2016 at a lower list price, highlights the PBMs’ economic incentives. “You would have predicted there would be tremendous uptake, but their share has been capped” because PBMs were not satisfied with the amount of rebate they received, he said. Robert McMahon, Merck’s president of the U.S. market, said the list price of Zepatier “affords Merck the opportunity to compete across all patient segments and potentially broadens access for underserved patient populations” and that the company was pleased with the drug’s progress. Hepatitis C drug prices came down because of Express Scripts’ efforts, Henry said. Gilead offered minimal rebates on Sovaldi when it first came out and had little competition, he said. Its discounts only increased markedly after Express Scripts refused to cover its Harvoni drug at one point in favor of a competitor. Merck’s lower traction was more likely because it was the third to market, Henry said. “Rebates don’t raise drug prices, drugmakers raise drug prices,” he said in an email. CVS spokeswoman Christine Cramer echoed his statement, saying, “Pharmaceutical companies alone are responsible for the high prices they set in the marketplace, which have increased many multiples above inflation in recent years.” Keywords pharmacy benefit managers, Rhode Island, Woonsocket, Gilead Sciences Inc.’s hepatitis C cure, Providence, CVS Print Comment Tweet Comments No comments on this story | Please log in to comment by clicking here Please log in or register to add your comment Related Stories health care Roberts named CVS executive vice president, chief operating officer (March 3, 2017) investing Investors push corporate boards to add women, people of color (March 3, 2017) retail CVS removes artificial trans fats from store food product brands (Feb. 22, 2017) Popular Most Read 1.

It finds high diversity in how vaccine companies are improving access to vaccines for people in poorer countries. This diversity is generally linked to the size of portfolios and pipelines.      (Photo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/474509/Access_to_Vaccines_Index_Infographic.jpg ) Vaccines are one of the most powerful health interventions available. Yet WHO estimates that 19.4 million infants worldwide are still missing out on basic vaccines. " There is a world to be won by increasing access to vaccines, " says Jayasree K. Iyer, Executive Director, Access to Medicine Foundation. "As a global community, we all share responsibility of ensuring everyone benefits from immunisation. The companies that develop and manufacture vaccines clearly also have a role to play. This Index has mapped what vaccine companies are doing, and what prompts them to take action-a critical step to making vaccine markets more inclusive." The independent Index, published Monday, analysed companies' R&D pipelines, identifying 89 vaccine projects for high-priority diseases. This includes dozens of first-ever vaccines, for diseases such as Ebola and a range of deadly bacterial infections. If successful, such vaccines could prove critical for tackling anti-microbial resistance (AMR). The Index also finds companies are taking steps to prevent shortages and that, when setting prices, they take affordability into account to a degree. All companies consider a country's eligibility for support from Gavi, a public-private partnership that funds vaccine purchases for lower-income countries. A growing market  The global vaccine market is growing: between 2000 and 2014, it expanded from USD 6 bn to USD 33 bn, with sales to richer countries accounting for around 65% of the total. Governments are spending more on vaccines, including poorer countries. Many lower income countries procure vaccines with financial support from Gavi and through organisations such as UNICEF: UNICEF doubled its vaccine spend between 2010 and 2014, to USD 1.5 bn. The Index has mapped the actions of eight key vaccine companies, including the largest companies in terms of revenue. Often termed "the big four", GSK, Merck & Co., Inc., Pfizer and Sanofi represent around 80% of global vaccine revenues. Serum Institute of India is also in scope. It is of major importance for global public health, with a wide geographic reach and selling almost 1.4 billion vaccine doses each year. In addition to these five, the Index evaluates three further companies with significant potential for improving access to vaccines: Daiichi Sankyo, Johnson & Johnson and Takeda. The Access to Vaccines Index measures company activity across defined sets of diseases and countries. The disease scope comprises 69 diseases with the highest priority for improving access to immunisation: 44 diseases where no vaccines exist on the market, and 25 diseases where vaccines exist but with issues surrounding accessibility. The geographic scope comprises 107 countries with the highest perceived need for access to vaccines. The Index has examined company behaviour in three areas: research & development; pricing & registration; and manufacturing & supply. All eight were evaluated in research & development: here GSK leads, followed closely by Johnson & Johnson. Six (Daiichi Sankyo and Takeda are the exceptions) have vaccines on the market for diseases in scope and sales in countries in scope. These six companies were therefore suitable for evaluation in pricing and registration, and in manufacturing and supply. Across all three areas, GSK performs the best with Sanofi also performing well across the board. Portfolios and pipelines follow the markets  In their vaccine portfolios and pipelines, the eight companies in scope concentrate on diseases with larger global markets: for example, the diseases with the most vaccines on the market are meningococcal disease, polio, seasonal influenza and hepatitis (A and B); the top five diseases targeted by R&D projects are pneumococcal disease, seasonal influenza, meningococcal disease, respiratory syncytial virus and human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer. Research & development: companies at work on innovation  Vaccine companies are working on 89 vaccine R&D projects for 35 diseases. The most attention is given to pneumococcal disease, human papillomavirus and seasonal influenza. This focus largely corresponds to commercial incentives. A third of the projects in pipelines target one of 12 diseases relevant to the Index for which no vaccine yet exists, including Ebola, E. coli, C. difficile, and bacteria from the streptococcus and staphylococcus families. Once a vaccine has been rolled out in real-world settings, it becomes clear whether further R&D is required to improve or adapt it. Adaptations account for almost half of the industry's vaccine R&D pipeline. The most common adaptation is to expand the range of diseases (or strains) that a vaccine provides protection from. Also common are projects that aim to make vaccines more resilient to temperature fluctuations - important for countries where refrigeration is not always an option. For many diseases in scope, vaccines do not promise significant profits - particularly for diseases such as leprosy or human monkeypox that predominantly affect populations in low- and middle-income countries."For these diseases, our research tells us that alternative incentives are likely necessary to encourage companies to develop new vaccines- such as public-private partnerships for vaccine R&D, or commitments to purchase new vaccines in bulk," says Jayasree K. Iyer. Pricing & registration: companies consider affordability to a degree  Immunisation programmes involve considerable costs, with vaccine prices accounting for a significant proportion. Vaccine companies have a responsibility to ensure vaccines are affordable for governments with limited resources. The Index has evaluated how companies take affordability into account when setting prices, as well as their efforts to register them for use in low- and middle-income countries. When setting vaccine prices, most companies consider affordability to a degree and a country's market conditions. Vaccine prices are also informed by cost, including investments in clinical development, and by the public health value of the vaccine. The only factor considered by all six companies evaluated is a country's eligibility for support from Gavi. Companies generally offer their lowest prices to Gavi-eligible countries. Many middle-income countries (MICs) are not eligible for Gavi support, and yet face healthcare budget constraints. When setting vaccine prices in MICs, the Index does not find clear evidence that companies systematically consider countries' ability to pay. Looking ahead, the Index concludes that companies need a systematic approach to affordability, especially for countries that receive no support from Gavi and do not participate in pooled procurement via PAHO and UNICEF Manufacturing & supply: companies take action to prevent shortages  Vaccine demand can outstrip supply for a range of reasons, including outbreaks, inaccurate demand forecasting and manufacturing interruptions. All vaccine companies evaluated by the Index in this area are taking action to align global supply and demand, suggesting that vaccine shortages are, in some cases, being detected, mitigated and/or prevented. Four companies take comparatively strong action: GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc. and Sanofi. Compared to other companies, these four take more actions that are key to improving supply. This includes having processes in place for scaling up production when needed and regularly reviewing whether supply matches projected demand. These four companies have also committed to staying in vaccine markets where there are few or no other suppliers, and/or notifying market stakeholders in advance when reducing supply. " Disease outbreaks will continue to occur, " says Jayasree. "It is especially important that vaccine companies continue to improve approaches for preventing shortages. Companies need to be at the table as governments and others work to build resilient health systems." The Access to Vaccines Index has been developed by the Access to Medicine Foundation, an independent non-profit organisation based in the Netherlands. The Access to Vaccines Index is funded by the Dutch National Postcode Lottery.

Yet WHO estimates that 19.4 million infants worldwide are still missing out on basic vaccines. "There is a world to be won by increasing access to vaccines," says Jayasree K. Iyer, Executive Director, Access to Medicine Foundation. "As a global community, we all share responsibility of ensuring everyone benefits from immunisation. The companies that develop and manufacture vaccines clearly also have a role to play. This Index has mapped what vaccine companies are doing, and what prompts them to take action -a critical step to making vaccine markets more inclusive." The independent Index, published Monday, analysed companies' R&D pipelines, identifying 89 vaccine projects for high-priority diseases. This includes dozens of first-ever vaccines, for diseases such as Ebola and a range of deadly bacterial infections. If successful, such vaccines could prove critical for tackling anti-microbial resistance (AMR). The Index also finds companies are taking steps to prevent shortages and that, when setting prices, they take affordability into account to a degree. All companies consider a country's eligibility for support from Gavi, a public-private partnership that funds vaccine purchases for lower-income countries. A growing market  The global vaccine market is growing: between 2000 and 2014, it expanded from USD 6 bn to USD 33 bn, with sales to richer countries accounting for around 65% of the total. Governments are spending more on vaccines, including poorer countries. Many lower income countries procure vaccines with financial support from Gavi and through organisations such as UNICEF: UNICEF doubled its vaccine spend between 2010 and 2014, to USD 1.5 bn. The Index has mapped the actions of eight key vaccine companies, including the largest companies in terms of revenue. Often termed "the big four", GSK, Merck & Co., Inc., Pfizer and Sanofi represent around 80% of global vaccine revenues. Serum Institute of India is also in scope. It is of major importance for global public health, with a wide geographic reach and selling almost 1.4 billion vaccine doses each year. In addition to these five, the Index evaluates three further companies with significant potential for improving access to vaccines: Daiichi Sankyo, Johnson & Johnson and Takeda. The Access to Vaccines Index measures company activity across defined sets of diseases and countries. The disease scope comprises 69 diseases with the highest priority for improving access to immunisation: 44 diseases where no vaccines exist on the market, and 25 diseases where vaccines exist but with issues surrounding accessibility. The geographic scope comprises 107 countries with the highest perceived need for access to vaccines. The Index has examined company behaviour in three areas: research & development; pricing & registration; and manufacturing & supply. All eight were evaluated in research & development: here GSK leads, followed closely by Johnson & Johnson. Six (Daiichi Sankyo and Takeda are the exceptions) have vaccines on the market for diseases in scope and sales in countries in scope. These six companies were therefore suitable for evaluation in pricing and registration, and in manufacturing and supply. Across all three areas, GSK performs the best with Sanofi also performing well across the board. Portfolios and pipelines follow the markets  In their vaccine portfolios and pipelines, the eight companies in scope concentrate on diseases with larger global markets: for example, the diseases with the most vaccines on the market are meningococcal disease, polio, seasonal influenza and hepatitis (A and B); the top five diseases targeted by R&D projects are pneumococcal disease, seasonal influenza, meningococcal disease, respiratory syncytial virus and human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer. Research & development: companies at work on innovation  Vaccine companies are working on 89 vaccine R&D projects for 35 diseases. The most attention is given to pneumococcal disease, human papillomavirus and seasonal influenza. This focus largely corresponds to commercial incentives. A third of the projects in pipelines target one of 12 diseases relevant to the Index for which no vaccine yet exists, including Ebola, E. coli, C. difficile, and bacteria from the streptococcus and staphylococcus families. Once a vaccine has been rolled out in real-world settings, it becomes clear whether further R&D is required to improve or adapt it. Adaptations account for almost half of the industry's vaccine R&D pipeline. The most common adaptation is to expand the range of diseases (or strains) that a vaccine provides protection from. Also common are projects that aim to make vaccines more resilient to temperature fluctuations - important for countries where refrigeration is not always an option. For many diseases in scope, vaccines do not promise significant profits - particularly for diseases such as leprosy or human monkeypox that predominantly affect populations in low- and middle-income countries. "For these diseases, our research tells us that alternative incentives are likely necessary to encourage companies to develop new vaccines - such as public-private partnerships for vaccine R&D, or commitments to purchase new vaccines in bulk," says Jayasree K. Iyer. Pricing & registration: companies consider affordability to a degree  Immunisation programmes involve considerable costs, with vaccine prices accounting for a significant proportion. Vaccine companies have a responsibility to ensure vaccines are affordable for governments with limited resources. The Index has evaluated how companies take affordability into account when setting prices, as well as their efforts to register them for use in low- and middle-income countries. When setting vaccine prices, most companies consider affordability to a degree and a country's market conditions. Vaccine prices are also informed by cost, including investments in clinical development, and by the public health value of the vaccine. The only factor considered by all six companies evaluated is a country's eligibility for support from Gavi. Companies generally offer their lowest prices to Gavi-eligible countries. Many middle-income countries (MICs) are not eligible for Gavi support, and yet face healthcare budget constraints. When setting vaccine prices in MICs, the Index does not find clear evidence that companies systematically consider countries' ability to pay. Looking ahead, the Index concludes that companies need a systematic approach to affordability, especially for countries that receive no support from Gavi and do not participate in pooled procurement via PAHO and UNICEF Manufacturing & supply: companies take action to prevent shortages  Vaccine demand can outstrip supply for a range of reasons, including outbreaks, inaccurate demand forecasting and manufacturing interruptions. All vaccine companies evaluated by the Index in this area are taking action to align global supply and demand, suggesting that vaccine shortages are, in some cases, being detected, mitigated and/or prevented. Four companies take comparatively strong action: GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc. and Sanofi. Compared to other companies, these four take more actions that are key to improving supply. This includes having processes in place for scaling up production when needed and regularly reviewing whether supply matches projected demand. These four companies have also committed to staying in vaccine markets where there are few or no other suppliers, and/or notifying market stakeholders in advance when reducing supply. "Disease outbreaks will continue to occur," says Jayasree. "It is especially important that vaccine companies continue to improve approaches for preventing shortages. Companies need to be at the table as governments and others work to build resilient health systems." The Access to Vaccines Index has been developed by the Access to Medicine Foundation, an independent non-profit organisation based in the Netherlands. The Access to Vaccines Index is funded by the Dutch National Postcode Lottery.

These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. More than 80% of patients with moderate-severe plaque psoriasis attained 75% clearance with the anti-IL23p19 antibody tildrakizumab after inadequate response to etanercept (Enbrel). Note that the study suggests that the p19 inhibitors, as a class, could broaden the therapeutic options for patients who have not responded to the current biologics used in the past for plaque psoriasis. ORLANDO -- More than 80% of patients with moderate-severe plaque psoriasis attained 75% clearance with the anti-IL23p19 antibody tildrakizumab after inadequate response to etanercept (Enbrel), an analysis of two randomized trials showed. Among 120 patients who switched from etanercept after 28 weeks of treatment, 81.4% met criteria for a PASI 75 response at 52 weeks. Almost 70% of the patients attained a Physician Global Assessment (PGA) 0/1 response (clear or nearly clear) after the switch. "My interpretation of these results is that if you are not responding to etanercept, and you are being switched to tildrakizumab, the drug will work," Kristian Reich, MD, of SCIderm Research Institute and Dermatologikum Hamburg in Germany, said here at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) annual meeting. "If you are a nonresponder to etanercept, your chance of responding to this drug is pretty similar compared to patients who have not received etanercept at all." "What does this mean for clinical practice?" Reich continued. "I think it means that the p19 inhibitors, as a class, will broaden our therapeutic armamentarium and give us the opportunity to induce response in patients who have not responded to the biologics we've had before." Another report at AAD showed that about 90% of patients who achieved PASI 75 responses at 28 weeks maintained the responses at 64 weeks, and more than 80% of patients who relapsed after discontinuing treatment regained PASI 75 responses upon restarting tildrakizumab. The findings from the two studies added to the primary results of the phase III reSURFACE 2 trial, which showed that two-thirds of patients treated with tildrakizumab attained PASI 75 response at 12 weeks compared with 48% of etanercept-treated patients. About three-fourths of patients treated with either of two doses of tildrakizumab attained PASI 75 by week 28, compared with 54% of the etanercept group. Clinical development of IL-23 inhibitors for psoriasis initially focused on the p40 fragment, which is shared with IL-12. More recently, attention turned to p19, which is specific to IL-23. The increased specificity could lead to improved activity and response without sacrificing safety, said Reich. The analysis of patients who switched from etanercept has considerable relevance for clinical practice. "Many of us have patients on biologics that we've used in the past, and when these drugs fail, we often switch patients to another biologic," said Reich. "Having an idea of what to expect after switching a patient would be very useful." Participants in reSURFACE 2 were randomized to one of two doses of tildrakizumab, placebo, or etanercept. The trial had co-primary efficacy endpoints of PASI 75 and PGA 0/1 response, both assessed at 28 weeks. Patients who did not achieve PASI 75 response by 28 weeks had the option to switch to the higher dose (200 mg) of tildrakizumab and continue treatment to week 52, receiving tildrakizumab at weeks 32, 36, and 48. Reich said 57% of etanercept-treated patients attained PASI 75 responses, and 51% attained PGA 0/1 responses. At 52 weeks, 81.4% of the 120 patients had met the endpoint of PASI 75 response, and 68.5% attained PGA 0/1 responses. Additionally, 41.6% of the patients attained PASI 90 responses and 15.9% attained PASI 100 responses. For comparison, Reich cited results from the primary analysis of the reSURFACE 2 trial. Among patients randomized to tildrakizumab 200 mg, 74% had PASI 75 responses at 28 weeks, and 71% had PGA 0/1 responses. PASI 90 and PASI 100 responses at 12 weeks were secondary endpoints, and rates among patients allocated to tildrakizumab were 58% and 27%, respectively. The second tildrakizumab report at AAD focused on a re-randomization component of reSURFACE 1, which involved 772 patients, allocated to the two doses of the IL-23p19 inhibitor or placebo. The trial design called for patients who attained PASI 75 response at 28 weeks with tildrakizumab to be randomized again to continue treatment to 64 weeks or discontinue, Kim Papp, MD, PhD, of Probity Medical Research in Waterloo, Ontario, and colleagues reported in a poster presentation. The results showed that 94% of patients who continued the 200-mg dose of tildrakizumab and 88% of those who continued the 100-mg dose maintained PASI 75 responses to week 64. Additionally, 57% and 49% of patients who discontinued the two doses of tildrakizumab maintained PASI 75 response to week 64. Among patients who discontinued tildrakizumab and relapsed (loss of PASI 75 response), 83.3% and 85.7 of patients in the 200- and 100-mg groups regained PASI 75 response after retreatment with their randomized doses of the drug.

6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- According to Kalorama Information, the global hospital acquired infection control market was worth about $16.0 billion in 2016. This market focuses on nosocomial infections, infections that develop in patients during hospitalization or during stays at health facilities. The market figure includes testing products, device sterilization, specific cleaning products, and HAI treatments. The healthcare market research firm's report, Hospital Acquired Infection (HAI) Control Markets, provides market analysis for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment segments of such infections. "The infection control market is a probable growth market for some time," said Bruce Carlson, Publisher of Kalorama Information. "There will always be a need to control these infections, as many of the bacteria that cause infection evolve and develop resistance to antimicrobials. New approaches to preventing, diagnosing, and treating such infections will be required for the long-term." The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is committed to reducing the national rate of HAIs by demonstrating significant, quantitative, and measurable reductions in Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI), Central Line-associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSI), Clostridium difficile ("C. diff"), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and surgical site infections.  The prevention segment of the HAI control market encompasses both sterilization and disinfection equipment.  There is a growing trend for department-wide treatments and a revolving replacement rate is continuing to generate market stability.  The rate of replacement for typical steam, heat or chemical sterilizers is between 8 and 11 years, which offers a stable replacement sales base.  New technologies are a driving factor for growth, with increasing interest in wide-area sterilizing and disinfecting programs. Diagnosis – testing for nosocomial infections – is a fast-growing market segment.  The increased awareness of infections is improving sales for the segment; admission screening and susceptibility testing are become popular choices for reducing infection risks.  The treatment segment of the HAI control market has struggled to maintain growth with a weak development pipeline, growing generic product introductions, and growing resistance problems.  However, more advanced products effective at treating serious infections demand a higher price, which is continuing to offset some challenges in the market.  Kalorama Information's Hospital Acquired Infection (HAI) Control Markets provides market estimates and forecasts of the markets for the prevention, testing, and treatment of infections in healthcare surroundings, including the world revenues for 2010-2021 for hospital infection control, for hospital infection treatment, and for hospital infection prevention equipment and consumables (sterilization/disinfection).  Sales information is also provided for the different market segments by primary geographic region (United States, Europe, rest of world) and leading manufacturers' shares.  Merck, Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, and Bayer – key companies in HAI control markets – are among those manufacturers featured in the report's competitor analysis.  View the full abstract and purchase the report here: https://www.kaloramainformation.com/Hospital-Acquired-Infection-10662659/.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 6 March 2017 by Military News Infectious Disease Treatment Market Set to Surge Significantly During 2017 – 2025 – Persistence Market Research The Infectious Disease Treatment Market  report provides in-depth analysis of parent market trends, macro-economic indicators and governing factors along with market attractiveness as per segments. The report also maps the qualitative impact of various market factors on market segments and geographies. Cholera infection re-entered Peru in 1996 and spread through the existing sanitation and water systems, causing over 3,000 deaths. Seafood exports were embargoed from Peru and tourism decreased, costing an estimated loss of at least US$ 770 Mn to the Peruvian economy in one year. International military networks such as the U.S. Department of Defense Global Emerging Infections System (DoD-GEIS), private clinics, individual scientists and public health practitioners are the networks which provide the formal information sources for the spread of infectious diseases. Easy approval from Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for drug regulation in market, and role of major key players also plays an important role for the infectious disease treatment market. Infectious Disease Treatment Market: Key Players Some of the major players in global infectious disease treatment market are Janssen Global Services, Merck & Co., GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceutical, Inc., Pfizer, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Novartis, Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Auritec Pharmaceuticals, Isis Pharmaceuticals and Gilead Sciences. etc. A Sample of this Report is Available Upon Request @http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/12733 Infectious Disease Treatment Market: Regional Overview On the basis of regional presence, global infectious disease treatment market is segmented into five key regions viz.  North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Middle East & Africa. North America is expected to lead the global infectious disease treatment market due to unhealthy food intake habits of the population, improper sanitization, new disease evolution and environmental conditions. According to the WHO statistics for the year 2011, prevalence of infectious disease treatment is high in developed countries such as U.S. and U.K. More precautions are being undertaken in the MEA region due to the prevalence of various viral diseases which have a potential to spread and create an epidemic situation for the world population.

These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. ORLANDO -- Ixekizumab (Taltz) proved superior to ustekinumab (Stelara) for several outcomes after 24 weeks of treatment in patients with psoriasis, researchers reported here. After 24 weeks, 83.1% of psoriasis patients treated with injectable ixekizumab achieved a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 90 (PASI90) -- clear to almost clear skin -- versus 59% of the patients on ustekinumab (P<0.001), said Kristian Reich, MD, of the Dermitologikum Hamburg in Germany, and colleagues. Treatment with ixekizumab allowed 49.3% of patients to achieve a PASI100 -- completely clear skin -- compared with 23.5% (P<0.001) of patients who were treated with ustekinumab, they stated in a presentation at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) annual meeting. Ixekizumab was approved by the FDA for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults in March 2016, while ustekinumab gained FDA approval in 2009 in the same patient population. Results from the IXORA-S trial also demonstrated that patients getting ixekizumab had better scores on the physician's global assessment (PGA) for scores of 0-1, with 86.6% of patients reaching that goal compared with 69.3% of patients on ustekinumab (P<0.001). On the even more stringent PGA 0, 53.7% of patients ixekizumab achieved that rating compared with 24.1% of patients on ustekinumab at week 24 (P<0.001). Treatment with ixekizumab was also superior to ustekinumab when measured on the Dermatology Quality of Life Index -- about 66% of patients on ixekizumab achieved a 0-1 score on that measure compared with 53% of patients on ustekinumab (P<0.05), Reich said. However, ixekizumab was not significantly better than ustekinumab in reducing itchiness, or in reducing skin pain often associated with psoriasis, he noted. The study assigned 136 patients with psoriasis to treatment with ixekizumab (160-mg starting dose, then 80-mg every 2 weeks for 12 weeks, followed by 80-mg every 4 weeks). The remaining patients (n=166) were assigned to ustekinumab (45 mg/90 mg depending on weight-based dosing). Patients on ixekizumab are in an extension trial that will continue for 52 weeks, Reich said. The patients were about 43-years-old and two-thirds were men. The majority of patients were from Western Europe, with patients from Eastern Europe and North America making up the rest of the study population. At baseline the mean PASI score was about 20, and the mean PGA was 3.6. Reich said there were no deaths in the trial, and no significant difference in overall adverse events in the treatment groups. Five (3%) of the patients on ustekinumab experienced serious adverse events compared with three patients (2.2%) taking ixekizumab (P=0.735). One individual on ustekinumab and two people on ixekizumab discontinued their assigned drugs because of adverse events. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred among 75% of the patients on ustekinumab and 70% of the patients treated with ixekizumab (P=0.299), while serious treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 10 (6%) of patients taking ustekinumab versus six (4.4%) of patients taking ixekizumab (P=0.613). "I have already changed my practice, and have been using ixekizumab because it shows the highest efficacy of any biologic, as the primary result of the trial showed. This work reinforces that earlier convincing evidence," commented AAD session moderator Andrew Blauvelt, MD, of Oregon Medical Research Center in Portland. The study was supported by Eli Lilly.

These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. ORLANDO -- An investigational nitric oxide-releasing topical gel appeared to be safe and effective for the treatment of genital or perianal warts, researchers said here. Complete clearance of baseline warts in the intention-to-treat analysis was achieved in 33.3% of 30 patients treated with topical application of the high dose of the agent (12% SB206) compared with 4.3% of 27 patients who used a vehicle gel (P=0.0099), according to Stephen Tyring, MD, PhD, MBA, of the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston, and colleagues. Complete clearance of baseline warts in the per protocol analysis was achieved in 42.1% of patients treated with the high dose of 12% SB206 compared with 6.7% of patients who used a vehicle gel (P=0.02), he reported in a presentation at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) annual meeting. In the dose-ranging phase II trial conducted at 15 U.S. centers, researchers found that the twice daily dosing of SB206 was too toxic and was discontinued after recruiting 12 patients for that dose. In the intention-to-treat analysis, a 4% gel dose of SB206 reduced warts 20.8% among the 23 patients who received that dose, but that difference from the vehicle gel was not significant. Tyring said 14.3% of the 14 patients who received the 8% gel dose of SB206 were free of warts by week 12 of the trial, but that difference also was not significant when compared with the vehicle gel. AAD session moderator Andrew Blauvelt, MD, of Oregon Medical Research Center in Portland, called the results "compelling. This is a novel mechanism of action. I think that nitric oxide has promise for a number of dermatologic conditions." Tyring explained that the experimental agent contains NVN1000, a macromolecule that raises nitric oxide, which is an endogenous anti-viral agent. In pre-clinical trials, the use of SB206 inhibited formation of warts in animal models. About 70% of the 108 study participants were men, and were in their 30s. Eligible patients had two to 20 external genital/perianal warts at baseline. Of the 12 patients given the twice daily formula, 35% quit the study due to adverse events. The researchers also analyzed treatment by sex. Tyring said that among the patients treated with once daily doses of SB206, 25% of males and 23% of females achieved complete clearance of baseline warts. About 6% of men, but no women achieved complete clearance of warts when they were treated with vehicle gel. Overall, in the per protocol population of patients who received once daily SB206, there was a 60% reduction in baseline wart counts compared with about a 32% decline for patients who were given the vehicle gel at week 12. In considering just the 12% formulation of SB206, Tyring reported that use of the gel was associated with a decline of both baseline and recurrent warts when compared with the vehicle gel at week 12 (P<0.05). In addition, the higher dose appeared to be safe with a 16.7% rate of application site adverse events and a low 3% rate of discontinuation. The study was sponsored by Novan. Tyring disclosed relevant relationships with Novan, AiCuris GmbH, Genocea Biosciences, Merck, Nycomed Amsterdam, and Vical. Blauvelt disclosed relevant relationships with AbbVie, Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma, Dermira, Genentech, Genzyme, GlaxoSmithKline, Glenmark, Janssen-Ortho, Eli Lilly, Merck, Novartis, Regeneron, Sun Pharmaceuticals, and Valeant Pharmaceuticals. 2017-05-03T00:00:00-0400 last updated 03.05.2017 Primary Source American Academy of Dermatology Source Reference: Tyring S, et al "Results From Phase II Study of Nitric Oxide-Releasing SB206 Once Daily Administration Show Favorable Efficacy and Safety in Genital Warts" AAD 2017; Abstract 5220. 0 comments More in Meeting Coverage Below-Ankle Interventions Promising for Foot Salvage Psoriasis Responds After Biologic Failure Coated Balloons Found Less Effective in Women for Peripheral Lesions Cimzia Passes Muster in Two Psoriasis Trials About Help Center Site Map Terms of Use Privacy Policy Advertise with us Your Ad Choices The material on this site is for informational purposes only, and is not a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis or treatment provided by a qualified health care provider. © 2017 MedPage Today, LLC.

These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. About 40% of patients with moderate or severe atopic dermatitis had complete or near-complete clearance of involved skin areas after 16 weeks of treatment with the dual cytokine inhibitor dupilumab. Note that similar results emerged from a phase II trial involving children, ages 6 to 17 years, with dramatic improvement occurring within the first 4 weeks after a single dose of dupilumab. ORLANDO -- About 40% of patients with moderate or severe atopic dermatitis (AD) had complete or near-complete clearance of involved skin areas after 16 weeks of treatment with the dual cytokine inhibitor dupilumab, a randomized trial showed. The improvement was maintained out to 52 weeks in most patients, which included adults and children as young as 2 years old. By the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), two-thirds of patients had at least 75% improvement (EASI 75) in skin status at 16 and 52 weeks, according to Andrew Blauvelt, MD, of Oregon Medical Research Center in Portland, and colleagues. Patients treated with dupilumab plus topical corticosteroids had about 60% improvement in pruritus at 16 and 52 weeks, as compared with about 30% of patients who received topical steroids and a placebo, they reported at the American Academy of Dermatology annual meeting. "The is the first randomized, placebo-controlled study of a biologic for atopic dermatitis for a 1-year period," Blauvelt said. "Both dose regimens of dupilumab plus topical corticosteroids provided significant improvement versus placebo in multiple efficacy measures and patient-reported outcomes." "Blocking signaling of the type 2 (Th2) cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 leads to sustained control of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis during the 52-week treatment period. There are ongoing confirmatory phase III programs in asthma and other allergic diseases," he added. Similar results emerged from a phase II trial involving children, ages 6 to 17 years, presented at the meeting. In this study, baseline EASI scores declined by as much as 76% at 12 weeks. The results with dupilumab were "clearly impressive" but the key unknown about the drug, and others like it, is staying power, said Joel Gelfand, MD, of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. "This is a first-in-class drug that shows great efficacy, but if the lessons from biologics apply here, people lose efficacy over time," said Gelfand, who was not involved in the study. "It will be a big advance, but we will still have a lot of work to do. Patients with atopic dermatitis have miserable skin disease. If they only respond for a couple of years, then we'll definitely have to come up with more strategies to help them." The Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 mediate multiple features of AD, as well as asthma and other atopic and allergic diseases. The monoclonal antibody dupilumab was developed to target both cytokines. In two placebo-controlled phase III trials, treatment with dupilumab monotherapy led to significant improvement in signs and symptoms of atopic at 16 weeks. Blauvelt reported findings from another phase III evaluation of dupilumab in AD, this time paired with topical steroids. Patients were randomized 2:1:2 to three treatment groups: weekly subcutaneous dupilumab; subcutaneous dupilumab administered every 2 weeks (q2w); or weekly placebo. Patients in all three groups also received topical corticosteroids. The primary endpoint was an investigator global assessment (IGA) score of 0 or 1 (complete or near-complete clearance) plus at least a 2-point improvement in the IGA by week 16. The key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving EASI 75 at 16 weeks. Data analysis included 740 patients, who had a baseline body surface area involvement of 50% to 60% and median EASI score of about 30. The 16-week results showed that 39% of patients in each dupilumab group met the primary endpoint, as compared with 12% of the placebo group (P<0.0001). At week 52, 36% of patients in the dupilumab q2w group met the primary endpoint, 39% with weekly dupilumab, and 13% with placebo (P<0.0001). Analysis of the secondary endpoint showed that 69% of patients in the dupilumab q2w group achieved EASI 75, 64% in the weekly dupilumab group, and 23% of the placebo group (P<0.0001). At 52 weeks, the EASI 75 rates were 65% with dupilumab q2w, 64% with weekly dupilumab, and 22% with placebo (P<0.0001). Analysis of EASI 50 and EASI 90 rates also showed large differences in favor of the dupilumab arms at 16 and 52 weeks. Two quality-of-life assessment tools demonstrated a twofold difference in scores in favor of both dupilumab groups at 16 and 52 weeks (P<0.0001 for all comparisons). Adverse event profiles were similar among the three treatment groups. The pediatric study involved 40 adolescents (ages 12 to 17) with moderate or severe AD and 38 children (ages 6 to 11) with severe AD. The patients received a single subcutaneous dose of 2 or 4 mg/kg, followed 8 weeks later by four weekly dose, said Michael J. Cork, MD, PhD, of the University of Sheffield in England. Many of the patients had been hospitalized, some for weeks. The 12-week results in the adolescents showed 66.4% reduction in baseline EASI score with the 2 mg/kg dose of dupilumab and 69.7% with the higher dose. In the younger children, improvement averaged 63.4% with dupilumab 2 mg/kg and 76.2% with 4 mg/kg. Pruritus scores decreased by 30% to 40% in both age groups. Dramatic improvement occurred within the first 4 weeks, after a single dose of dupilumab. Adverse events were mostly mild and transient. "After one dose, the dupilumab is blocking all of the IL-4/IL-13 targets, and this translates into this amazing clinical picture, where we see a reduction in EASI of 60% with one injection, and four injections, almost 70% reduction," said Cork. The studies were supported by Sanofi and Regeneron. Blauvelt disclosed relevant relationships with AbbVie, Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Celgene, Dermira, Genentech, GlaxoSmithKline, Janssen, Lill, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, Regeneron, Sandoz, Sanofi, Genzyme, Sun Pharma, UCB, and Valeant.

Note that the study suggests that the announcement linking reimbursement to procedural appropriateness for New York Medicaid might well have significantly influenced patient selection for PCI. Quality improvement efforts in 2011-2012 took a solid bite out of inappropriate use of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) -- at least in New York, a study found. In that state inappropriate PCIs fell from 18.2% in 2010 to 10.6% in 2014, with a particularly sharp drop of 15.3% to 6.8% for the subgroup of Medicaid patients. In addition, total inappropriate PCIs fell 69% over the same period (2,956 patients in 2010 to 911 in 2014), a figure that reached 75% for the Medicaid population (340 to 84), according to Edward L. Hannan, PhD, of State University of New York at Albany, and colleagues, writing online in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. "Although the range of hospital inappropriateness rates remained large, more than two-thirds of all hospitals decreased their inappropriateness rates by at least 2.9%, and one-half of the hospitals decreased their rates by more than 6.3%. Thus, although it appears that most hospitals have successfully reduced their inappropriateness rates, there is room for improvement among many hospitals." Hannan's group suggested several measures behind these reductions: For one, appropriate use criteria (AUC) for PCI were updated in 2012, the same year that every hospital in the state received its appropriate use scorecard. Additionally, in November 2011, New York State threatened to withhold reimbursement for Medicaid patients undergoing inappropriate PCI unless hospitals could rationalize these cases. Writing in an accompanying editorial comment, Frederick A. Masoudi, MD, MSPH, of the University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, and two colleagues said, "This represented the first and, to our knowledge, only instance where payment was linked directly with procedural appropriateness. Although this policy was abandoned in April 2016 and no payment was ever denied, a systematic examination of trends in utilization and characteristics of patients undergoing PCI in New York could provide important insights into these actions' potential impact on clinical care." A separate analysis by this group showed that among New York's Medicaid beneficiaries, the rate of inappropriate PCI did drop after the announcement of withheld reimbursement. "Conversely, among New York non-Medicaid patients, declines in inappropriate PCI occurred before the ... announcement; among non-New York Medicaid patients, declines were steady over the entire study period," the editorial noted. "Altogether, these findings suggested that the announcement linking reimbursement to procedural appropriateness for New York Medicaid might well have significantly influenced patient selection for PCI." Hannan and colleagues applied the 2012 AUC to PCI cases identified from New York's Percutaneous Coronary Interventions Reporting System. They took only elective procedures into account, excluding patients with acute coronary syndrome or previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The registry included data from 58 hospitals. "A caveat of the study is that the definitions of Canadian Cardiovascular Society class changed in 2012 in the New York registry," the authors acknowledged, adding that this could have biased results in favor of later years because of this definitional change. "Another caveat is that providers were incentivized to decrease their inappropriateness rates by upcoding patient severity of illness rather than improving patient selection." The editorial writers agreed: "Certainly, incentives for 'gaming' increase proportionally with financial disincentives for performing procedures classified as inappropriate. This highlights the importance of mechanisms to assess the accuracy of data used to classify appropriateness. The National Cardiovascular Data Registry has a robust, multifaceted data quality program including audits to assess the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of data submitted to all clinical registries, with a particular focus on variables that inform AUC assessments. "We must consider other consequences that may result from evolution of payment structures," Masoudi et al urged, cautioning that "as alternative payment models proliferate and health systems and providers bear increasing financial risk, the incentives that generated overutilization of expensive technologies will be replaced with others that could stimulate underuse." Hannan reported having no relevant conflicts. Study coauthors disclosed relationships with Abbott Vascular, Boston Scientific, Bristol-Myers Squibb/Sanofi, Cordis, Eli Lilly/Daiichi-Sankyo, Medtronic, Cardiovascular System Inc., Abiomed, Trireme, The Medicines Company, Capicor, Merck, and Stentys. Masoudi reported a contract with the American College of Cardiology for his role as chief science officer of the National Cardiovascular Data Registry, and another co-editorialist disclosed institutional support from Johnson & Johnson.

Photo by F. Carter Smith SXSW has saved the best for last. Just days before the festival kicks off, former Vice President Joe Biden has been added to the 2017 lineup. The former vice president will outline plans for a Biden cancer initiative on Sunday, March 12, at 3:30 pm. In his address, Biden will reflect on his leadership of the White House Cancer Moonshot and call for innovative solutions to help end cancer as we know it. In 2015, Biden's oldest son, Beau, lost a two-year battle to brain cancer at 46 years old. "We're excited to have Vice President Biden address the creative innovators and entrepreneurs that attend SXSW," says Hugh Forrest, SXSW's chief programming officer, in a release. "His commitment and leadership is crucial at a time when the smartest minds from the worlds of technology and healthcare are working together to create groundbreaking new solutions in the battle to end cancer." The speech is open to all SXSW badgeholders and will take place at the Austin Convention Center. A recording of the address will be made available on the festival website. Biden's appearance is part of the Connect to End Cancer SXSW series, a collaborative effort from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, the AT&T Foundry for Connected Health, and Merck & Co. Inc. The lineup ranges from panels to meet-ups, all of which take place on March 12. SXSW 2017 takes place March 10-19 around Austin.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 6 March 2017 by Military News Periodic Fever Syndrome Market Poised to Expand at a Robust Pace Over 2016 to 2024 Subtitle: The Periodic Fever Syndrome Market  report provides in-depth analysis of parent market trends, macro-economic indicators and governing factors along with market attractiveness as per segments. The report also maps the qualitative impact of various market factors on market segments and geographies. Periodic Fever Syndrome Market: Drivers and Challenges Periodic Fever Syndrome affects many organs and tissues and has its own set of symptoms along with high temperature during attacks. Elevated serum levels of acute-phase reactants such as fibrinogen and serum amyloid A, leukocytosis and high level of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are associated with periodic fever syndrome. Diagnostic tools and genetic test are available for patients with periodic fever. For some conditions such as Periodic Fever, Aphthous Stomatitis, Pharyngitis, Adenitis Syndrome (PFAPA), no genetic test are available yet. Hereditary periodic fever syndromes (HPFSs) are rare and is characterized by short and recurrent attacks. These attacks undergo remission without the use of antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, or immunosuppressive treatment. The patient feels healthy and is back to its daily routine until the next episode of periodic fever occurs. Previously, there was no approved medicine for the treatment of TNF Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS), Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D Syndrome (HIDS)/ Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency (MKD). In September 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Novartis’ ilaris (canakinumab) expanded use for the treatment of these three rare and distinct types of Periodic Fever Syndromes.Treatment with oral anti-inflammatory drugs, e.g. corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), helps to control the symptoms but does not assist in the prevention of Periodic Fever Syndrome. Based on the Indication, the global periodic fever syndrome market is segmented into Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS), Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D Syndrome (HIDS) and TNF Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS). Familial Mediterranean fever is less common in other ethnic groups compared to people of Eastern Mediterranean ancestry. TNF Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome and Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D Syndrome (HIDS)/ Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency (MKD) are less common among people and is estimated to affect around 1-2 people per million (Mn). Expansion of the clinical pipeline by companies and the greater focus on patient care and monitoring have been the major strategies adopted by major players to fuel growth within the forecast period of 2016-2024 in the global Periodic Fever Syndrome Market. Key challenges faced by the market is limited knowledge, and limited treatment options as periodic fever syndrome is a rare disease. There is difficulty in the diagnosis of periodic fever syndrome due to unrelated symptoms. Periodic Fever Syndrome Market: Regional Overview On the basis of geography, global periodic fever syndrome market is segmented into five key regions i.e. North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East & Africa. North America is expected to dominate the global Periodic Fever Syndrome Market due to high demand from U.S. A sample of this report is available upon request @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/12190 Periodic Fever Syndrome Market: Key Players Some of the major players in global Periodic Fever Syndrome Market are Novartis AG, Simvastatin, Merck & Co., Inc., Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB.  Browse Full Report summary and to request sample report and table of content@ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/periodic-fever-syndrome-market.asp About Us Persistence Market Research (PMR) is a third-platform research firm.

The London-based court, which handles intellectual property disputes, ruled last Friday in favor of Samsung Bioepis and its partner Biogen, invalidating AbbVie’s two secondary patents on Humira. The ruling also marked a win for Japanese drugmaker Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics (FKB), which had taken on AbbVie in the same trial as a claimant siding with Samsung Bioepis and Biogen.  A Samsung Bioepis employee works in a lab at the company’s headquarters in Songdo, Incheon (Samsung Bioepis) Last year, Samsung Bioepis and FKB filed a lawsuit challenging the validity of AbbVie’s secondary patents over the dosage regimens for Humira (adalimumab) in treating rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis. Before the trial commenced, AbbVie had abandoned its two patents in question and proposed settling the dispute. However, the claimants did not accept the proposition, calling for a definitive judgment on the case. The court, which proceeded with the trial, sided with the claimants’ view that Humira’s dosing regimens were “obvious” or “anticipated” at the time that the two patents were filed, and thereby not subject to patent protection. AbbVie’s composition patent on Humira is set to expire in Europe in 2018. However, the US pharmaceutical giant has been filing new patents over the drug’s usage considerations to fend off biosimilars — cheaper, near-replicas of biologic drugs — until at least 2022. Humira is the world’s best-selling drug for autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, generating worldwide revenues of more than $14 billion for AbbVie in 2015. “We welcome the court’s judgment. At Samsung Bioepis, we remain committed to driving positive change in the health care system through the development of affordable, high-quality biosimilars,” Samsung Bioepis said in a statement. The UK ruling is expected to help speed up the release of Humira biosimilars — particularly ones developed by Samsung Bioepis and FKB — in the UK as well as across Europe. “AbbVie has been filing overlapping patents on Humira to extend its patent life,” said Dongbu Securities analyst Koo Ja-yong, noting other biosimilar makers had lost their patents disputes over Humira in the US last year, dampening the sales outlook of Humira-referencing biosimilars. “However, Samsung Bioepis has successfully obtained a ruling that invalidates AbbVie’s Humira indications. We expect this ruling to push forward the European launch of Humira biosimilars,” Koo said. The UK court judge in charge of the case said that the ruling would serve a useful purpose in dispelling AbbVie’s “threats that it will enforce its patents against biosimilar competition anywhere in the world.” “The declarations will serve a useful purpose of dispelling commercial uncertainty in the UK (and European) market, which those threats have created,” Justice Henry Carr wrote in his ruling. “It is reasonably foreseeable that the grant of the declarations will promote a settlement on a European or even a worldwide basis,” he said, suggesting the ruling could impact future patent jurisdictions in neighboring countries. Samsung Bioepis’ Humira-referencing biosimilar, SB5, was accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency, the region’s drug regulator, in July 2016. Once it obtains marketing authorization, SB5 would become the Korean drugmaker’s third biosimilar to hit markets in Europe. The company already sells two biosimilars — one referencing Enbrel and another referencing Remicade — in Europe. In addition to Samsung Bioepis, global pharmaceutical companies including Amgen, Novartis as well as Coherus Biosciences, FKB and others, are working to launch their own Humira-referencing biosimilars. In Amgen’s case, it has already secured the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval of Amjevita, its Humira-referencing biosimilar. Yet the company most likely will not be able to commercialize Amjevita within this year, as AbbVie has filed a lawsuit claiming patent infringement.
