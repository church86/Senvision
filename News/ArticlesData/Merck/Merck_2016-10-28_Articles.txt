A speedy approval pushed the underdog into the front of the line for lung cancer patients, but another rival is snapping at its heels. Cory Renauer (TMFang4apples) Oct 28, 2016 at 3:41PM Image source: Merck & Co. Following a speedy FDA approval, Keytruda from Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) became the first drug in its class to reach the front line in lung cancer. Until recently, it seemed Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) would dominate this important field with Opdivo, but surprisingly poor trial results set it back a few paces. This is great news for Merck investors who have watched the company's sales slide for years, but the cheering might not last very long. Roche (NASDAQOTH:RHHBY) isn't far behind, with a similar drug threatening to pour water on Keytruda's latest advantage before it catches fire. MRK Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Total revenue at Merck has fallen a great deal over the past several years. Let's have a closer look at Keytruda's playing field to see if its recent victory can return the big American pharma to growth. Christmas in October It was early September when the FDA accepted Keytruda's application for first-line treatment of lung cancer patients whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1 on their surface. Although the agency set an action date on Christmas Eve, it gave Merck a thumbs-up just seven weeks after accepting the application.  Merck's Keytruda, and Bristol's Opdivo, act on immune-system cells to prevent tumors from using PD-L1 to shut down an immune-system attack, and it does the trick. In the study that led to the label expansion, Keytruda alone reduced these patients' risk of disease progression or death by 50% compared with standard chemotherapies. Image source: Getty Images. Lung cancers claim more lives than breast, colon, and prostate cancer combined, so it isn't surprising that the FDA sped up the review process in light of those results. This is a huge win for Merck, and for lung cancer patients, because it makes Keytruda the first chemo-free treatment option for those newly diagnosed with this form of the deadly disease -- but how long it will have the field to itself is hard to pin down. Big trouble from Basel Roche's Tecentriq blocks the same pathway as Bristol's Opdivo and Merck's Keytruda, but instead of attaching to immune cells, it binds to PD-L1 on the surface of tumor cells. It was the third inhibitor of this checkpoint to earn an FDA approval, but it's making quick strides. Earlier this month, the agency approved the immunotherapy for treatment of certain lung cancer patients who progressed during or after platinum-based chemotherapy, just five months after granting its first approval in bladder cancer. With seven ongoing trials testing Tecentriq in the first-line lung cancer setting, the Swiss oncology giant's differentiated immunotherapy could join Keytruda as a chemo-free treatment option for newly diagnosed patients. Merck investors will want to keep an eye on Tecentriq's progress here, as it appears effective for lung cancer patients regardless of PD-L1 expression levels. Remember, Keytruda's first-line approval is limited to patients with tumors that overexpress the protein.  Gaining approval for patients regardless of their tumors' PD-L1 levels is more significant than you might think. Last October, the FDA granted approval to Opdivo and Keytruda for patients who progressed on or after chemotherapy, with one big difference: Oncologists don't need to test tumors for PD-L1 expression to treat their patients with Opdivo. In the numbers A one-size-fits-all advantage in second-line lung cancer has been been largely responsible for the wide chasm between the two drugs' sales figures. In the second quarter, Bristol-Myers Squibb recorded Opdivo sales of $840 million. More recently, Merck's third-quarter Keytruda sales were just $356 million. Opdivo's dismal performance as a monotherapy in first-line advanced non-small-cell lung cancer -- with tumors expressing moderate levels of PD-L1 -- should allow Keytruda to maintain its advantage for at least several quarters as a chemo-free first treatment option in patients with tumors that express high levels of the protein. Image source: Getty Images. Keytruda's future looks brighter than it did a few months ago, but its growth alone might not be sufficient to push total sales above the peaks reached several years ago. The immunotherapy's annual run rate of $1.4 billion based on third-quarter sales should pop after the recent approval. If Roche's Tecentriq doesn't muscle into its lung cancer position, Keytruda sales could eventually top $8 billion. Hitting such a bullish estimate would send a smaller company's top line soaring, but Merck is carrying too much weight. The Januvia franchise, which comprised 15.5% of the company's total sales in first three quarters of the year, is at a standstill and in danger of losing ground to next-generation diabetes treatments. With its biggest seller at a tipping point, and half a dozen key products falling by double digits, pulling Merck's total sales to new heights will probably require more power than any single drug can provide.

The company's MK-1293 may be battling for a share of the long-acting insulin market next year. Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Oct 29, 2016 at 11:40AM Last quarter, Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) filed for FDA approval of a biosimilar to Sanofi SA's (NYSE:SNY) megablockbuster, long-acting insulin, Lantus. If the FDA approves Merck's drug, then it could begin competing for a share of Lantus' $6 billion plus in sales as soon as next year. Image source: Getty Images. Awaiting approval MK-1293 is a Lantus biosimilar co-developed by Merck and Samsung Bioepis, a joint venture between Biogen and Samsung BioLogics. Lantus is an insulin glargine used by both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients to help keep their blood sugar steady throughout the day. Unlike mealtime insulin, which works like the insulin your body releases when you eat, Lantus releases insulin into your bloodstream at a slow and steady rate over the course of a day to better manage blood sugar in between meals and overnight. Typically, diabetes patients are first treated with oral drugs, such as metformin, however, these drugs become less effective over time, forcing the addition of injection-therapies, such as long-acting insulin, to continue controlling the disease. Because the global population is getting increasingly larger, wealthier, and living longer, more people are being diagnosed with diabetes. According to the International Diabetes Federation, 415 million people on the planet have diabetes and that number will grow to 642 million in 2040. Because most of these patients will ultimately progress to requiring long-acting insulin, Lantus has become one of the world's biggest selling drugs, generating over $6 billion in sales for Sanofi last year alone. Undeniably, Lantus pending patent expiration and megablockbuster status means that there's a massive market opportunity for generic drugmakers -- especially in the United States where Sanofi produces about two-thirds of its Lantus revenue. Hoping to capture a big chunk of those sales, Merck, with the help of Samsung Bioepis, evaluated MK-1293 in human trials involving both type 1 and type 2 patients. Those trials demonstrated that MK-1293 works similarly to Lantus. In August, the FDA accepted for review Merck's application for MK-1293's approval, starting the clock on a scientific review to determine if there are no clinically meaningful differences in terms of the safety, purity, and potency between it and Lantus.  Angling for share European regulators are also evaluating MK-1293, and an EU decision could be made before the end of 2016. While there's no guarantee the FDA would follow in the EU's footsteps on MK-1293, an approval in Europe could increase the likelihood that the FDA comes down in favor of the biosimilar next year. If approved, MK-1293 could add meaningfully to Merck's top line, however, an approval alone won't guarantee that happens because the market for long-acting insulin is increasingly competitive. Merck will need to convince doctors to prescribe MK-1293 instead of Lantus and outmaneuver competitors that have launched their own long-acting insulin. Sanofi may be one of Merck's fiercest competitors. In early 2015, Sanofi secured FDA approval of Toujeo, a next-generation, long-acting insulin, and the company is working ferociously to convert existing Lantus patients to it. Merck will also need to sidestep diabetes giant Novo Nordisk. Novo launched Tresiba, a long-acting insulin, last year, and in the first six months of 2016 Tresiba sales are up 167% year over year to more than $200 million. Merck won't be the only Lantus biosimilar on the market either. Eli Lilly cut a deal with Sanofi last year that allows it to begin marketing a Lantus SoloStar biosimilar this December. SoloStar is an injectable pen variation of Lantus that accounts for more than 60% of Lantus' U.S. revenue. Overall, there's unquestionably a big opportunity to reshape the long-acting insulin market, and MK-1293 positions Merck nicely to get its fair share of sales in the market. However, Merck's $42 billion in annualized third quarter revenue means that it may be a while before MK-1293 sales reach levels that really impress Merck investors.  Todd Campbell has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The company's MK-1293 may be battling for a share of the long-acting insulin market next year. Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Oct 29, 2016 at 11:40AM Last quarter, Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) filed for FDA approval of a biosimilar to Sanofi SA's (NYSE:SNY) megablockbuster, long-acting insulin, Lantus. If the FDA approves Merck's drug, then it could begin competing for a share of Lantus' $6 billion plus in sales as soon as next year. Image source: Getty Images.

Sanofi, Pfizer, Inc., and Merck & Co, Inc. These players collectively accounted for over 70% of the market in terms of revenue in 2015. Analysts at Transparency Market Research have identified some of the key strategies adopted by players in the Human Vaccines Market in order to gain a competitive edge over the rest. These include mergers and acquisitions, collaborations and acquisitions for market penetration, the establishment of local production sites, the expansion of product portfolios, and expansion activities in regions with high growth potential. A focus on research and development is also a successful growth strategy, TMR finds. For instance, Pfizer, Inc. has always focused on R&D in order to improve innovation and productivity. It is presently working on various pipeline products for different therapies and innovating new capabilities that can position it for long-term leadership across the globe. The global human vaccines market was valued at US$28.3 bn in 2015 and is estimated to reach US$72.5 bn by 2024, registering an 11.2% CAGR during the forecast period. Inquire for a Sample Copy of the Research Report: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=16127 Hospital Pharmacies and Drugstores Prominent Distribution Channels for Human Vaccines  By age group, pediatric vaccines accounted for a 57.5% share in the global human vaccines market in 2015. Adult vaccines, on the other hand, are expected to expand at a 13.2% CAGR from 2016 to 2024. Based on product, the pneumococcal segment accounted for the majority share in in 2015, with the hepatitis segment exhibiting strong growth during the forecast period. On basis of vaccine type, the conjugate vaccines segment accounted for the majority share in the global human vaccines market in 2015. On the other hand, the combination vaccines segment is expected to expand at an outstanding CAGR from 2016 to 2024. By distribution channel, the hospital pharmacies segment led the global human vaccines market. However, the drugstores segment is projected to expand at a considerable pace through 2024. Geographically, North America dominates the global human vaccines market and is estimated to reach a value of US$28.0 bn by 2024. Asia Pacific is the most promising market for human vaccines and is expected to expand at a high CAGR of 12.5% during the forecast period. Browse Research Report with Complete TOC: http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/human-vaccines-market.html Minimal Side Effects of Vaccines Bolstering Large-scale Adoption  An extremely low risk of serious and fatal side effects associated with vaccines is one of the primary factors driving the market for human vaccines around the world. Similar to other drugs, vaccines are associated with a few side effects; however, most of the times, these are rather mild. Soreness, swelling, redness at the site of injection, fever, rash, or itchiness are the most common side effects of vaccines. Several healthcare organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the US FDA, the American Medical Association (AMA), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend the use of vaccines owing to their safety. Complementing this factor is the growing awareness among patients and the general population regarding the benefits of vaccination. This can be attributed to a rise in awareness programs by government, private, and not-for-profit organizations. "The celebration of the National Immunization Awareness Month in the month of August in the U.S., for instance, is a great way of spreading awareness and getting more people to opt for vaccination," the author of the report states. High Costs Deterring Market Growth  Strict regulatory requirements is a major hurdle for most players in the global human vaccines market. In addition to this, high costs pose a significant challenge. "The discovery and development of new vaccines require immense capital. Moreover, the transportation, storage, and handling of vaccines can also be extremely heavy on the pocket," the TMR analyst reports. Apart from this, the containment of technical expertise in the hands of a few major players also acts as a deterrent on the growth of the human vaccines market.

Cheryl Swanson (CherylSwanson) Oct 29, 2016 at 12:05PM Image source: Getty Images. Looking for a bright spot in the gloom of Gilead Sciences' (NASDAQ:GILD) long decline in share price? Earlier this month, news broke that all of Gilead's HCV drugs must now bear the so-called dreaded "black box" label -- the FDA's most serious warning on a prescription med. The market braced for a gut punch, because the warnings affixed to AbbVie's (NYSE: ABBV) hep-C drugs a year ago sliced 10% off its share price. Although Gilead's HCV franchise is of the utmost importance to this company, representing over 50% of total sales, the biotech's stock has barely budged. There are a couple of reasons why. First, a big sell-off based on a negative but commercially insignificant headline typically signals that the market was looking for a reason to dump the stock anyway. Correspondingly, when the share price holds firm, it indicates that those investors who panic easily have already exited. In other words, given that Gilead's trailing-12-month P/E is at a record low of 6.4, it's possible that a lot of bad news is already baked into the stock price. Put those things together, and shareholders should feel justified in maintaining a healthy optimism about Gilead's future. Let's look at how the biotech's HCV franchise could be impacted by the FDA warning and why the stock may finally be ready to turn the corner. "Black box" won't dent HCV drug sales long term The so-called "black-box warnings" -- officially known as boxed warnings -- are the most serious safety warnings the FDA imposes on a drug. First instituted in 1979, the warnings are intended to highlight a serious adverse reaction that may be life-threatening but could be prevented by limitations on drug usage. That warning will now be slapped on the entire crop of hep-C wonder drugs -- not just Gilead's and AbbVie's, but also Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE: JNJ) Olysio, Merck &Co's (NYSE: MRK)Zepatier, and Bristol-Myers Squibb's (NYSE: BMY) Daklinza. Why? The FDA said it noted 24 cases in which direct-acting antivirals brought patients' previous hep-B infections roaring back. Two patients died, and one required a liver transplant. While that sounds grim, investors should realize that hundreds of thousands of hep–C patients have been treated (and cured) by the antivirals. They have a near-perfect cure rate, and prior interferon-containing combo treatments were slower and less effective, and produced multiple side effects in many more patients. There's no doubt that physicians will continue to prescribe them. In fact, black-box warnings often have little impact on sales if the drugs are effective. Two noteworthy examples are attention-deficit drug Ritalin and popular antibiotic Cipro (ciprofloxacin). Ritalin is projected to take in a stunning $17.5 billion by the year 2020, and Cipro continues to be routinely prescribed by doctors for mild infections. What's more significant is that the FDA wants physicians to screen patients for hep-B infections before prescribing. That could delay the onset of treatment by Gilead's hep-C drugs, but it should not, in the long run, reduce the number of patients treated by more than a couple of percentage points. According to reports in the Annals of Gastroenterology, cases of HBV/HCV coinfection in the U.S. range in the low single digits.  The silver lining: Hep-B screening could open up a new market It's estimated that up to 1.4 million people have chronic hep-B in the U.S. Like hep-C, the disease can cause liver failure and also death, and it's also a silent killer, like hep-C. While around 50% of those stricken with hep-C don't realize they are at risk, raise that percentage to around 65% with hep-B. Gilead has a drug on the market to treat hep-B: Viread. Viread faces generic competition in December 2017, but Gilead's new version (TAF) will likely head that off and build stronger sales, because it causes far less damage to bones and kidneys. But the real opportunity for Gilead may be in GS-9620, which is now in human trials and being touted as a possible hep-B cure. In fact, Gilead has its sights set on curing two more viral epidemics -- hep-B and HIV -- just as it created the first cure for hep-C. Image Source: Gilead Sciences investor presentation. A pipeline aimed at the world's biggest killers Gilead faces long odds in curing either of those viral epidemics any time soon. Its biggest near-term success is more likely to come in another multibillion-dollar market: the treatment of a disease known as NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis), which is reaching epidemic proportions in the United States. Gilead just announced today that it was advancing promising investigational drug GS-4997 into phase 3 trials against the disease. Despite the potential of Gilead's drugs, the company's valuation reflects a great deal of fear -- and very little hope about its future. The stock's forward P/E of 6.7 is a tiny fraction of the average biotech's forward P/E of 63, or the broader pharmaceutical industry's forward P/E of 28. With HCV sales declining and Wall Street laser-focused on quarterly numbers, unlocking near-term shareholder value in this stock may require an acquisitive Big Pharma company with a lucrative buyout offer. But in the long term, investors have more important things to rely on: Gilead's incredible track record of innovation, a rock-bottom P/E, and a pipeline that just might contain a cure for another one of the world's big killers.

Ogg October 29, 2016 9:50 am EST Print Email Tweet Investors have had to interpret a lot of data in this aging bull market and ahead of the election. Despite the recent volatility, the one undeniable trend is that investors have been willing to buy stocks into every market sell-off. That won’t be the case forever, but that has been true for five years or so. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each morning of the week. The goal is to find new investing ideas and trading ideas for our readers. Some of these analyst research reports cover stocks to buy, and some of these end up covering the top stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Investors need to consider many sorts of issues when it comes to buying a stock. How much risk is there? How much potential upside is there? Is the stock viewed as cheap, or does it have a premium because of its position today? Does it pay a dividend and/or does it buy back stock? How is its balance sheet and how solid are the business prospects? The ending on October 28 was the week that the earnings floodgates flew wide open. High valuations in general and the notion that the bull market is seven and a half years old just are not stopping investors from having an appetite. 24/7 Wall St. tracked three unusual research patterns emerging out of the 30 Dow stocks in the week ending October 28. The Big Apple Isn’t Just New York City Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) had a very unusual earnings report. Earnings and guidance were all in all pretty good, but CEO Tim Cook seemed uncertain how to capitalize on Samsung’s smartphone woes. Despite these issues, Apple’s consensus analyst price target has now climbed back above $130. Right before Apple’s earnings report, its consensus price target was $128.81, and was $126.73 just 30 days ago and $124.11 some 60 days ago. Within two days of earnings, 24/7 Wall St. tracked 13 key analyst changes. These were from the likes of Stifel, Credit Suisse, Mizuho, Merrill Lynch, S&P, Barclays and many more key firms. Apple shares were trading at $113.69 upon Friday’s closing bell, down from $118.25 earlier in the week before earnings. Apple has a 52-week range of $89.47 to $123.82. Conglomerate City General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) has seen a moderate downward trend on its consensus analyst price targets going into and after its third quarter earnings failed to impress. But with shares still trading under $30, it was interesting to see that Merrill Lynch not only reiterated its Buy rating but maintained its $37 price objective. That is a full $5 higher than what is now the consensus target, and the report even noted how GE’s third quarter was underwhelming and that the $2.00 earnings per share target would require more cost cuts and more cash deployment to hit. Still, the firm noted: We expect GE to stand out as one of the better growth stories in our large-cap space at the end of 3Q earnings season. GE did not back away from the $2 EPS by 2018, but highlighted that more cost-cuts and buyback are required to get to the goal. It is important to know that this is a tie for GE’s highest analyst target price. GE closed at $29.22 on Friday, and that was after a 2% gain on hopes of a Baker-Hughes partnership for its oil and gas services. GE’s consensus analyst target is $32.00 (versus $33.71 just 90 days ago), and its 52-week range is $27.10 to $33.00. Big Pharma This past week, Argus reiterated Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) at Buy, but what stood out was that the drug giant’s price target was raised to $80 from $65. That was up over 30% from the $60.87 prior close, plus there is the 3% dividend yield. Argus sees earnings growth driven by strong sales of oncology drug Keytruda, Zepatier for hepatitis C,and Gardasil for HPV. The Argus report said: Merck shares trade at 15 times our 2017 earnings per share estimate, above the average multiple of 13.9 for our coverage universe of pharmaceutical stocks. While Merck carries a premium valuation, we believe the company has a strong pipeline of new drugs that could contribute meaningfully to revenue over the next five years… We believe that Merck has a strong product pipeline and that Keytruda has substantial opportunities as a treatment for solid tumors, such as lung cancer, melanoma, and head and neck cancer. Recently approved and forthcoming indications for Keytruda, along with growth from Zepatier and Gardasil, should contribute significantly to future sales growth. Investors might want to notice that the consensus price target was $68.32 on Friday, and that consensus target is up over 10% in the past 90 days. Also note that Merck’s absolute highest price target is now up at $82.00, and it has a 3% yield. Merck shares closed down 4% at $58.84 on Friday, in a 52-week range of $47.97 to $64.86.

Here's what management had to say. Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Oct 29, 2016 at 6:24AM Friday wasn't a good day for AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV). The company announced its third-quarter results shortly before the market opened. AbbVie's stock fell over 6% in pre-market trading and didn't do much better the rest of the day. Here's what the company's management said while AbbVie stock was being hammered. (All quotes courtesy of S&P Global Market Intelligence.) Image source: Getty Images. 1. Humira sales are tracking with expectations Nothing is more important to AbbVie than Humira. The autoimmune disease drug generated over 60% of AbbVie's total revenue in the third quarter. A lot of the discussion on the company's earnings call related to Humira and what seems to be slowing momentum. AbbVie CEO Rick Gonzalez said that Humira is "performing exactly where we would have expected it to perform in the international markets" and has had "outstanding growth" in the U.S. Gonzalez said that biosimilars that are now available outside of the U.S. are only having a "very modest impact" on Humira's sales. But what about the slowdown in sequential sales growth for the drug? AbbVie CFO Bill Chase said, "It is not unusual in the U.S. or abroad to see a general flattening out over the summer and then an acceleration back in the back half of the year." Chase thinks that is what happened in the third quarter. He added that the company "feels very, very good" about the full-year growth forecast for Humira. 2. Imbruvica is just getting started There weren't any worries about Imbruvica losing momentum. Sales for the cancer drug soared in the third quarter. AbbVie's message about Imbruvica: Even better things should be ahead. Gonzalez said that Imbruvica's "market share position is steadily increasing" in the front-line chronic lymphocatic leukemia (CLL) indication. He noted that the drug already holds the market-leading position as a second-line treatment for CLL and for relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma and Waldenstroem's macroglobulinemia. AbbVie awaits regulatory approval for Imbruvica in treating relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma and expects to submit for approval for treating chronic graft-versus-host disease in the first half of 2017. Imbruvica could face competition relatively soon from AstraZeneca's (NYSE:AZN) acalabrutinib. AstraZeneca has stated that it plans to submit its drug for regulatory approval by the end of 2016 but didn't specify for which indication. AbbVie's management was asked twice about the possible threat from AstraZeneca. Mike Severino, AbbVie's chief scientific officer, acknowledged that he was aware that acalabrutinib could be moving toward approval but focused on the great potential for Imbruva. 3. As far as Viekira, um, well... AbbVie's executives mentioned Viekira all of two times during the company's earnings call. Once was to briefly mention strong international performance from the hepatitis C drug. The second brief statement referenced declining U.S. sales. AbbVie CFO William Chase said that Viekira had "seen market share loss and some price erosion due to the entrance of a new competitor in the market." Who was that new competitor? Zepatier. Merck (NYSE:MRK) launched its hep C drug earlier this year. The entrance of Zepatier accounted for some of that market-share loss mentioned by Chase. Merck was squarely behind Viekira's price erosion. The drugmaker priced Zepatier lower than other hep C drugs on the market, forcing AbbVie and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) to offer discounts on their products. AbbVie undoubtedly knows Viekira's best days are behind it. Sales for the drug plunged nearly 20% in the third quarter compared to the prior-year period. Management talked more about the new hepatitis C combo treatment that it expects to launch next year. This combo will be taken once per day and will treat all genotypes of hep C. However, no one on AbbVie's team discussed the fact that Gilead has already hit the market with its own pan-genotypic once-daily combo. Epclusa was approved by the FDA on June 28 and saw huge sales in just three days at the end of the second quarter.    Looking ahead AbbVie's executives did exactly what they're supposed to do: paint as pretty a picture about the company's prospects as they can. What does that picture really look like?  Humira should still keep on plugging along, but sooner or later growth won't just slow down. It will evaporate. AbbVie must get success from newer drugs and its pipeline. Imbruvica is a cornerstone for its strategy to build revenue outside of Humira. The company also needs more winners and is likely to get one with Elagolix, which should be submitted for approval in treating endometriosis next year. I think the scenario for AbbVie still looks pretty good over the next two or three years. Beyond that point, the picture of the company's prospects is like a Monet painting: a little fuzzy.

All rights reserved Terms of use Privacy Sitemap The Intercept_ Unofficial _Sources f t ✉ ⎕ 56 Photo: Miguel Medina/AFP/Getty Images Big Pharma Paid LGBT Groups and Others That Opposed California Drug-Price Ballot Measure Lee Fang Lee Fang 2016-10-28T16:39:34+00:00 Photo: Miguel Medina/AFP/Getty Images San Francisco’s two competing LGBT Democratic groups — the leftist Harvey Milk Democratic Club and the centrist Alice B. Toklas Democratic Club — rarely agree on contentious economic issues. But both groups announced in September that they would be opposing Proposition 61, the high-profile initiative to lower drug prices. A letter from the two groups claimed that Proposition 61 “will not lower prescription drug costs” and that the decision to jointly campaign against the initiative was reached after “careful consideration.” Unknown to many activists in the city, this act of political camaraderie appears to have been rewarded by the pharmaceutical industry, which cut each club a $5,000 check from a fund set up to defeat the drug price initiative. Neither LGBT group, both of which have sent voter guides to city residents, revealed the donation on their website, and neither responded to a request for comment. [Update 1:25PM ET: Peter Gallotta, the president of the Harvey Milk LGBT Democratic Club, wrote to The Intercept after publication to say that the No on 61 money was “earmarked specifically for our slate mailer and their contribution represents less than 6% of total contributions to our program,” adding that “it is typical for the Club to receive money from its endorsed candidates and measures.”] The money was disclosed in filings made on Thursday that showed 19 different civic organizations, from the Foreign Legion to a bilingual voter guide organization, taking drug industry funds and endorsing No on Prop 61. Proposition 61 is designed to allow California state agencies that pay for prescription drugs, such as the state Medicaid program and the state prison system, to pay the same or lower prices as listed by the federal Department of Veterans Affairs, which uses its collective bargaining power negotiate for better rates. While experts are divided over the actual cost savings that could be achieved through Prop 61, given the opaque pricing structure for state and federal agencies, many argue that the state could win significant discounts, given that the VA pays up to 42 percent less than Medicare, according a recent analysis. The drug industry, led by its lobbying giant the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), is furiously attempting to defeat Prop 61, fearing that if the measure succeeds in California, the largest Medicaid market, similar ideas could spread to other states and embolden politicians already facing pressure to act on the national level. To snuff out the drug price revolt, PhRMA has raised an astounding $109 million from its member companies, including Pfizer, Merck, Purdue Pharma, Johnson & Johnson, and other drug firms. That’s more than has been raised by both the Republican and Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate races in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Nevada combined — and those are among the most costly races in the country. In contrast, the proponents of the initiative — primarily the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which operates a number of nonprofit healthcare clinics — have raised just over $14 million. The No on Prop 61 war chest has been used to buy a seemingly endless stream of digital and broadcast advertisements across the state. A portion of the drug industry fund has been used to influence critical endorsements. Several Republican groups opposing Prop 61, including the Save Proposition 13 Segregated Fund, the Small Business Action Committee, and the National Tax Limitation Committee received drug industry money. Over half a million dollars flowed to groups sending out a variety of voter guides urging a vote against Prop 61. The COPS Voter Guide, a voter guide that says it endorses candidates that “have pledged to make public safety a top priority,” and opposes Prop 61, received $210,000 from the PhRMA fund. Other organizations, including the Latino Voter Guide, the California Senior Advocates League Voter Guide, the Coalition for Literacy, the California Voter Guide, and a group called Voter Guide Slate Cards, similarly received drug industry money. The practice of selling voter guide endorsements, though shunned by many consultants, is a common trick for interest groups seeking to buy the appearance of widespread support. The new disclosures also reveal more information about drug industry money to veterans groups, a controversial element of the campaign. No on Prop 61 hired Anthony Principi, the former secretary of veterans affairs during President George W. Bush’s administration, and Sacramento lobbyist Pete Conaty, to round up support from veterans on behalf of the campaign. An archive of Conaty’s now-deleted website advertises “Veterans Lobbying Services” and the ability to organize local groups on behalf of clients. Three of the veterans groups that endorsed No on Prop 61 and appeared in a television advertisement against the measure — the American Legion of California, Veterans of Foreign Wars of California, and the Vietnam Veterans of America CA State Council — all received direct payments from the PhRMA fund, the filings reveal. Other veterans groups that have campaigned against the initiative, including the American GI Forum, also received drug industry money. The No on 61 veterans ad claims that the measure will make healthcare more expensive for veterans, an allegation denied by proponents, who say that the VA will not allow drug firms to hike prices. “There also is no truth to the suggestion the measure increases the cost of a veteran’s copay,” the Sacramento Bee noted this week. “VA recipients have fixed co-pays, while some qualify for free health care altogether.” The backers of the measure responded through another veterans organization, VoteVets Action Fund, which aired an advertisement supporting the initiative. Notably, VoteVets has received funding from the Yes on Prop 61 campaign. The filings also provide more information about other consultants tied to the civic groups opposing Prop 61. The NAACP of California announced its opposition to Prop 61 this year. The disclosures show that AC Public Affairs, a consulting firm run by Alice Huffman, the president of the California NAACP, received $80,000 in consulting fees and $38,500 for print ads from the drug industry’s No on Prop 61 fund. The U.S. pays far more for pharmaceuticals than any industrialized country in the world. Bloomberg found that Roche Holding AG’s Herceptin breast cancer drug, for example, “cost about 85 percent more in the U.S. than in other high-income countries.” One driver of the higher costs is a provision of the Medicare Part D law, essentially authored by PhRMA, which prevents Medicare from using its collective bargaining power to negotiate for better drug prices. (Congressman Billy Tauzin, R-La., the lawmaker who helped usher in the PhRMA legislation, later became a PhRMA lobbyist earning $11.6 million in annual salary.) A recent study found that $16 billion could be saved annually by simply allowing Medicare to negotiate for lower rates. Eli Lilly chief executive John Lechleiter, during on a conference call on Tuesday, sought to reassure investors by pledging that he is doing everything in his power to stop Proposition 61. His company has been in the news recently for price gouging, especially for its Humulin R U-500 insulin medicine, a very profitable product for the firm that Eli Lilly hiked in price by 325 percent from 2010 to 2015. “Prop 61, we’re fighting that tooth and nail in California,” Lechleiter said. “We have a pretty big campaign underway,” he added, noting that his company hoped to “shift voters toward a position of being against it for a whole variety of reasons.” Contact the author: Lee Fang✉lee.fang@​theintercept.comt@lhfang ˅ ⎕ 56 Comments (closed) The Intercept_ Newsletter D × ✓ Weekly Digest ✓ Breaking Stories and Exclusives ⟶ Email list managed by MailChimp Filters SVG

It’s one of those words that covers many different areas, from technology and infrastructure, to legal and risk issues to senior sponsorship to content management.   In the case of the digital workplace and intranet world, governance usually covers both strategic decision-making (usually with the likes of steering committees), and more operational matters, such as archiving policies.  Awards Hint at a Governance Trend So it was good to see governance emerge as one of the strongest themes in this year’s Step Two Intranet and Digital Workplace Awards (previously called the Intranet Innovation Awards).  Now in their 10th year, these global awards celebrate both the newer, shinier stuff (one of 2016 winners is about workplace use of virtual reality) and the successful back-end practices and processes. All winners need to demonstrate the impact of their project, which has the highest proportion of judges marks allocated. While the awards winners and other entries only give us a hint of general trends in the intranet and digital workplace space, if they are anything to go by, organizations are placing a healthy emphasis on carefully thought out governance plans when implementing new intranet or digital workplace projects.  Governance Through Site and Content Ownership Setting Clear Managerial Roles - and Supporting Them - at Darmstadt On the more operational side of intranets, we found companies that are putting great focus on the roles associated with managing content, communities and team spaces, and designing training around these roles.   For example, Darmstadt, Germany-based pharmaceutical company Merck’s intranet and collaboration environment, EVA, has a number of different “rooms” (effectively spaces) relating to different organizations, locations, topics, projects and processes.   Very well-defined roles around the management of each room enables the smooth operation of EVA. These roles include Room Owners, Room Managers, Local Room Managers as well as a set of Key Room Managers, the super-users who handle training and administrative rights.  The company offers a training program and support materials for each type of manager. Some of the roles and structures involved with running EVA, Merck’s digital workplace environmentPHOTO: Screenshot courtesy of Merck and Step Two Designs Establishing Content Ownership - and Trust - at Philips Amsterdam-based electronics company Philips launched a new topic-based intranet and worked hard to establish strong content ownership, with both page-level owners and topic owners who have a clear set of responsibilities.  These exist within a wider framework which internal communications owns. Individual content and topic owners are displayed clearly on each piece of content to help establish trust and confidence in the content, as well as the intranet as a whole. Other winners such as Queensland University of Technology and White & Case also put in place solid governance foundations to ensure content is reliable and relevant, and stays that way. While getting content and site ownership right doesn’t sound like rocket science, it’s amazing how many organizations don’t get it right — or start off with good intentions but let the framework wither and die.  Challenges of Digital Workplace Governance Governance becomes a little more challenging and complex within the wider digital workplace. The wider scope of channels and applications and the broader set of stakeholders involved both add to this, as does the fact that the "digital workplace" is a looser and still emergent concept.  Due to its relative newness and the different stages that organizations are in with the digital workplace, good practices have yet to be established. However in this year's awards we can see some hints of what a digital workplace governance looks like, with structures, approaches and practices applied to specific scenarios that could work within a wider digital workplace. Cross-Functional Governance in Action at McKesson A characteristic of digital workplace governance is its cross-functionality. Governance in this case involves a wider set of key support functions, who also serve as services and application owners. San Francisco-based global healthcare company McKesson is one example of this in action. Its intranet and collaboration team set up a Mobile Center of Excellence for Employee Apps which helps steer the deployment of in-house apps into a light appstore.  What’s impressive about McKesson’s efforts is that the Center of Excellence is truly cross-functional, including Communications, IT, HR as well as members of Security and Legal. The group not only provides ownership within McKesson, but also supports anyone wanting to set up an app on the mobile app store.  The Center now has an established process which follows an app from the idea stage to acceptance in the app store, with different stages along the way. Not only is this more efficient and follows desired practices, but it also means the team tackles some of the trickier aspects with apps (usually associated with risk) at an early stage. A simplified diagram of the app creation process managed through McKesson’s Mobile Center of ExcellencePHOTO: Screenshot courtesy of McKesson and Step Two Designs From SharePoint Governance to Digital Workplace Governance Another winner in this year’s awards was Novozymes, a Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based biotechnology company.  Here the IT function delivered a novel approach to SharePoint governance based on a framework developed by SharePointPeople. This highly detailed approach involves different levels of documentation around ownership, dependencies and process for various “managed elements” of the SharePoint environment which cover applications, processes and platform services. There are also owners for some overarching business drivers.   The detailed approach Novozymes took may not translate to every organization and every sector, the business took some interesting approaches worth noting:  Novozymes started with the premise that it would only create rules that can be enforced, so the system involves appropriate check-ins and controls to make sure that governance actually happens.  Even though IT drove the initiative, the company recognized that decisions need to actually happen from the business, so ownership lies with the appropriate decision makers and not behind the scenes with technologists.  The company designed a dashboard (based on SharePoint) with as much automation as possible to show the overall status of governance and ensure compliance. While the long-term success of the platform remains to be seen, IT are already rolling out the approach to other elements of the digital ecosystem beyond SharePoint. It’s an approach which can potentially work for the wider digital workplace.  Governance: Worth the Persistence Not all of the 2016 awards winners focused on governance. Some emphasized innovation and a more agile and light approach to development and deployment. However getting governance in place is a must-have if your goal is a sustainable digital workplace. The awards winners gave us a glimpse of what digital workplace governance can look like.  Getting governance off the ground requires persistence.  While not as glamorous as beautiful designs and cutting edge intranets, it's encouraging to see some of the awards winners devoting the time and effort into their governance programs.

Scientists have linked the condition to Alzheimer’s . In 2013, a spinal showed Donnelly had a very high plaque and tau count in his brain. That meant he probably had the disease. There’d been other indications, though. Trouble had surfaced three years earlier while he was in the midst of conducting a computer demo in England. “I was showing them how to do an order, how to fix something, and all of a sudden, there was nothing,” he said. “The screen went blank in my mind.” One of his colleagues stepped in. Today Donnelly is on long-term disability and determined to use every conscious moment to help eradicate Alzheimer’s. He’s participating in a Merck drug trial . “It’s a blind test so you don’t know whether you’re getting the drug or a placebo,” he said. “I don’t care. If it helps somebody else, great, let’s do it.” With the help of his son, Donnelly also works with Alzheimer’s New Jersey, a support and research organization staging Sunday’s Walk to Fight Alzheimer’s at Bergen Community College in Paramus. The event, which starts at 10 a.m., is expected to draw some 4,000 people. There’s something about having all those people together that’s comforting to Donnelly. Because, he says, Alzheimer’s is “an alone disease.” “You’re in your own little box trying to make sense of all the things your brain is telling you,” he said. Today, Donnelly doesn’t drive. He willingly stopped. Day to day, he approaches things asking a single question: Is it safe for me to do? Is it not safe? If it’s safe, he does it. From time to time, he said, new realities enter his brain. “The other day I had what I call TV camera vision,” he said. “Everything I looked at looked like I was viewing it out of a camera.” At this early-onset stage, Donnelly has resolve and said he would give his life to find a cure. His daily existence also is full of gracendue to his caregiver – his wife, Marybeth, who, he said, gives him care, consideration, and love. “That makes things a whole lot easier,” he said. Anyone interested in walking Sunday can show up at the college and register. For more information, CLICK HERE.

The mini-symposium titled *"Challenges and breakthroughs of anti-infective therapies - 10 years of AiCuris!" *will take place on Tuesday, November 8th from 11:00 am to 12:00 noon at the BIO.NRW booth 100. During this event, renowned experts in infectious diseases will discuss today's and future needs in the treatment of infectious diseases as well as innovative approaches that address urgent medical needs, e.g. in terms of new modes of action. Presentations at the mini-symposium include: · *Short introduction: Anti-infective therapy and resistance issues* Prof. Dr. Theodor Dingermann, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Institute for Pharmaceutical Biology · *Current challenges in anti-infective therapies from a clinician's perspective* Prof. Dr. med. Andrew Ullmann, University Hospital Würzburg, Department Infectious Diseases · *AiCuris: 10 years of successful R&D in anti-infective therapy* Dr. Holger Zimmermann, CEO of AiCuris Anti-infective Cures GmbH Prof. Dr. Theodor Dingermann will also moderate the mini-symposium. Anti-infectives, including antibiotics and antivirals have greatly increased human life expectancy since 1932 with the first commercially available antibacterial from Bayer Laboratories. "The current medical standards for the treatment and prevention of infections, e.g. in intensive care or transplantations, are unthinkable without anti-infectives. However, multi-drug resistant pathogens are now omnipresent and antibiotics, the former wonder drugs, are losing their effectiveness," commented Dr. Holger Zimmermann, CEO of AiCuris Anti-infective Cures GmbH. "Since our foundation as a spin out from Bayer in 2006, AiCuris has established itself as a powerhouse for anti-infectives R&D. The company strives to make a difference and is dedicated to develop novel resistance-breaking antiviral and antibacterial agents that address high medical needs." The AiCuris portfolio today comprises seven clinical development programs including letermovir, a prophylactic treatment against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in bone marrow transplant patients, licensed to Merck & Co. (MSD) in 2012. Last week, AiCuris announced that letermovir met the primary endpoint in a pivotal phase 3 study. Pritelivir, a helicase-primase inhibitor, being developed to treat herpes simplex virus Type 1 (HSV-1) and Type 2 (HSV-2) infections has successfully completed phase 2 clinical trials as an oral formulation against genital herpes and, in its topical form targeted against labial herpes, a clinical phase 1 study. Other preclinical and clinical programs include small molecules against HCMV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), adenovirus, resistance breaking hospital antibiotics and two immune modulators. In addition, AiCuris will present its recent successes and expected future developments in a company presentation on November 9th from 12:10 at the conference in room Room 1 / Rheinsaal 1. Companies interested in meeting with AiCuris at BIO-Europe(R) are asked to request a meeting through the event's partneringONE(R) online system or to contact business@aicuris.com. The Company will also be available to the media for interviews and background discussions. Please contact MC Services at caroline.bergmann@mc-services.eu to arrange for media meetings. *About BIO-Europe(R) * BIO-Europe(R) is the preeminent partnering conference for the life sciences, bringing together international decision makers from the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and financial sectors, offering networking opportunities, workshop and panel participation, a high profile exhibition, and private, prescheduled one-on-one meetings. The BIO-Europe(R) 2016 partnering event is expected to draw over 3,500 industry attendees for three days of high level networking, representing upwards of 1,900 companies from over 50 countries. *About AiCuris Anti-infective Cures GmbH* AiCuris was founded in 2006 as a spin-off from Bayer and focuses on the discovery and development of drugs against infectious diseases. The company's majority investor is SANTO Holding. The company is developing drugs for the treatment of viruses such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and adenoviruses. In the field of antibacterials, AiCuris seeks to develop innovative treatment options for life-threatening, (multidrug)-resistant hospital-treated pathogens. In 2012, AiCuris signed a license agreement with Merck & Co (MSD), one of the largest agreements of its kind in the European biotech industry. The agreement covers the development and commercialization of novel drug candidates against HCMV. Letermovir, the most advanced compound under this agreement, met primary endpoints in a pivotal phase 3 clinical trial in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation. *Contact:* *Media Relations* AiCuris Anti-infective Cures MC Services AG GmbH Katja Woestenhemke Anne Hennecke Friedrich-Ebert-Str. 475/Geb.

X Planet Business: Scratching the shingles itch Time Warner, John Lewis, paper receipts and Heathrow runway woe Fri, Oct 28, 2016, 08:00 Laura Slattery Come to no Harmondsworth: village is situated in west London right next to Heathrow and faces partial demolition following the UK government’s decision to build a third runway. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters         In numbers: Itchy business $1 billion Sum that analysts think GlaxoSmithKline could make annually by 2021 from worldwide sales of Shingrix, its imminent shingles vaccine. It has filed for regulatory approval for the drug in the US, and will apply in Canada and Europe next. 37,000 Number of people Shingrix has been tested on. Glaxo’s vaccine for herpes zoster, aka shingles, has been developed over two decades. $749 million Sales recorded last year by Glaxo rival Merck from Zostavax, the only shingles vaccine currently on the market. It’s a blistering performance. Image of the week: Village death-knell Welcome to Harmondsworth, where cars that do not drive slowly are not the biggest problem right now. That’s because the village is situated in west London right next to Heathrow and faces partial demolition following the UK government’s decision to build a third runway. About half of the village is set to disappear under the plans, with the other half, including an 11th-century church and a 600-year-old, grade-one-listed barn, aka the Great Barn, soon adjoining the runway tarmac. The people of Harmondsworth are mostly unimpressed by talk of world-class compensation packages for homeowners, and have decorated their lampposts with the appropriate protest signs. Nearby Longford, meanwhile, is set to be completely destroyed. The lexicon: Paperless till It won’t be of any surprise to shoppers to learn that a retail conspiracy is underway to rid our pockets, purses and “safe-keeping” drawers of paper receipts. Convenience stores stopped bothering with them ages ago. Supermarket staff now ask you if you want one, implying by their tone that only weird people do. And fashion retailers make a big play of sending customers “e-receipts” to their emails. Now Tesco has begun a three-month trial of a contactless, paperless till system that will send an e-receipt to an app on smartphones. The paperless till seems a more realistic prospect than the paperless office but, as saving-the-environment initiatives go, you might say it’s a little token. ADVERTISEMENT Getting to know: Paula Nickolds She began as a graduate trainee at the haberdashery department of London’s Oxford Street branch in 1994: now Paula Nickolds has been appointed managing director of John Lewis. Nickolds (43), who is currently commercial director of the department store chain, will become the first woman to lead it in its 152-year history when she takes up the position in January, replacing Andy Street, who is off to run as a Conservative mayoral candidate. Nickolds identifies “impatience” as the trait she least likes in herself, admitting “it drives everyone around me mad”. Before she officially takes control, there is the annual delight of the John Lewis Christmas ad, which is expected to “drop” as early as this day week. The list: Time Warner facts US telecoms group AT&T has declared its interest in buying entertainment behemoth Time Warner for $85.4 billion, which, if approved by competition regulators, could make it the biggest corporate deal this year. So which one is Time Warner again? 1. Eighties child: Time Warner was formed in the late 1980s from what was then regarded as the “mega-merger” of Warner Communications and publisher Time Inc, both of which date back to the 1920s. 2. Biggest regret: Its 2001 merger with AOL, since unwound, was the “biggest mistake in corporate history”, according to Time Warner’s current chief executive, Jeff Bewkes. 3. Prize asset: Time Warner comes complete with the original “golden age of television” network, HBO, which is great for news media, as it means the deal can be illustrated with pictures of Game of Thrones, and analogies between the cut-throat world of business and the kingdom of Westeros. 4. News beast: Time Warner’s CNN, controversially self-styled as the “most trusted name in news”, has been raking it in from a Trump-related ratings boost and expects to make about $100 million more in advertising cash as a result. 5.

The CARB-X, represents one of the world’s largest public-private partnerships focused on the preclinical discovery and development of new antimicrobial products.

The worst may be yet to come. A year after presidential candidate Hillary Clinton first tweeted about outrageous price gouging, the reality of pricing pressure in the U.S. hit Wall Street in the most concrete way: earnings. From drug distributor McKesson & Co., to biotechnology giants Amgen Inc. and AbbVie Inc. and insulin maker Eli Lilly & Co., this week’s third-quarter results showcased widespread evidence that the industry has pulled back on prices under the growing pressure from politicians and pharmacy benefit managers. The crush has sent shares down in the U.S. and beyond, hitting foreign drugmakers like Denmark-based Novo Nordisk A/S, the world’s largest maker of insulin, that have a large portion of their business in the country. “We’re only just getting into the storm now,” Novo Chief Financial Officer Jesper Brandgaard said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “We can’t in any way say that the worst is behind us.” The earnings season so far has yielded an apparent turning point in the industry -- a new era where drugmakers won’t be able to rely on price increases to boost revenue and profit. Most striking of all, according to Leerink Partners analyst Geoff Porges, was Amgen’s announcement late Thursday that it didn’t expect to be able to raise the price of its top drug, a medicine to treat autoimmune diseases called Enbrel, in 2017. The stock slumped 9.6 percent on Friday. ‘Still Shocking’ “It’s still shocking. This signals a really pretty profound sea change in the landscape for the industry,” Porges said by phone. “Payers are using more and more aggressive tactics to extract price concessions from manufacturers.” Porges estimated that more than 80 percent of Amgen’s operating income growth in the last six quarters came from Embrel price increases. Analysts covering the biotech industry -- who are used to wild stock moves in the high-risk sector -- expressed their bafflement on Friday. “After this week, we’re almost speechless, which, as you know, doesn’t happen often,” Baird & Co. equity analysts wrote in a note. The price shocks rippled far and large. AbbVie plunged 6.3 percent on Friday after reporting that third-quarter sales of its top-selling arthritis injection, Humira, fell short of predictions. Novo’s decision to cut its long-term growth profit target sent shares of U.S. rivals Lilly and Merck & Co. down as well. Earlier in the week, Lilly had posted a 14 percent slump in U.S. sales of its Humalog insulin, because of lower prices. Price War Casualties McKesson Chief Executive Officer John Hammergen took investors by surprise on a conference call Thursday when he said a rival wholesaler, which he didn’t identify, had started a price war. The stock plunged 23 percent on Friday, the most since 1999. Competitors Cardinal Health Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corp. sank 9.8 percent and 13 percent, respectively. “The idea that a key industry participant could potentially harm industry economics on price baffles us,” Ross Muken, an analyst at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients. So far this month, only three stocks in the 59-member Standard & Poor’s 500 Health Care Index have increased, while 11 have declined more than 10 percent. The index ended the week at its lowest since March 28. The rest of earnings season may show more evidence of price pressure. Pfizer Inc. and Gilead Sciences Inc. -- maker of hepatitis C drugs that have list prices of $84,000 to $94,500 -- report quarterly earnings next week. Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc., the target of government probes on pricing, is scheduled to post earnings on Nov. 8, the day of the U.S. presidential election. And Mylan NV, the center of public outrage over the price of its EpiPen allergy shots, reports the following day. “Halloween comes early to haunt biotech,” the Baird analysts said in their note. “Rhetoric this week on commercial payers has us believing we may be seeing the end of days.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Click here to return to MM&M's and PRWeek's Health Influencer 50 list and features. 30. Wendy Lund, CEO, GCI Health Wendy Lund said the best career advice she had ever given was, "Stick with it. It will get easier and everything is possible." Perhaps taking her own advice led her to become GCI Health's first CEO in 2010, following the merger of Cohn & Wolfe and GCI Group. She came to the agency with more than 20 years of healthcare comms experience and has built out the agency's capabilities. Under Lund's eye, GCI Health has tripled its size and expanded its presence in Europe with the 2013 opening of a London office. Lund began her career in the nonprofit world, giving back to the healthcare industry. She started as marketing VP for the National League for Nursing and then moved to a marketing role with Planned Parenthood. Plus, she served as a board member for the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association. Lund moved to the agency world in 1997 at MS&L, then to Publicis Consultants. –––––––––––––––––––––– 29. Anne de Schweinitz, MD, global healthcare, FleishmanHillard Anne de Schweinitz has led FleishmanHillard's global healthcare practice since 2012. When she joined the firm, Fleishman's then EMEA president — and now CEO — John Saunders said de Schweinitz got the role because of her history of positive client relationships. Saunders added that she "understands the importance of establishing sustainable and value-based relationships with clients." De Schweinitz has spent more than 15 years in healthcare communications. She's worked primarily in the agency world, with roles at MS&L, Big Arrow Group, and Hill & Knowlton before joining Fleishman. She is particularly experienced in comms for biotech, medical devices, patient advocacy, and U.S. and European regulation, among other areas of healthcare. She also worked in comms for the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center. She has lived in San Francisco, New York, and London in her career and has spent time in Antigua, Guatemala, and Budapest. When not running a global healthcare practice, she has a passion for arts and culture. De Schweinitz has supported New York institutions including the New York Historical Society, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. –––––––––––––––––––––– 28. Ray Kerins, SVP and head of U.S. comms, government relations and policy, Bayer Ray Kerins, who has led comms for pharmaceutical giants including Pfizer, Merck, and now Bayer for a decade, has taken an "engage-and-educate" approach to everything he does. Since joining Bayer in 2013, he has helped launch and lead a number of innovative programs, initiatives, and partnerships. See also: Bayer creates new role: VP of comms for consumer health "Engagement of the stakeholder, regardless of who they are, should be your first move [as a communications head]," Kerins told PRWeek in an interview last year. "When we are not engaging, we don't know what stakeholders are thinking." Kerins' team makes sure the "right information" about Bayer is promoted through video, historical views on a particular product, and the publication of research on products in question. However since March, he has been spearheading Bayer's fight against the Zika virus. Indeed, Kerins handles any number of responsibilities that require him to parry scrutiny from regulators, NGOs, and consumers. He serves as chairman of Bayer's PAC and as executive sponsor of Bayer Resources for Armed Forces Veteran Employees and BLEND, a global resource for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender employees and supporters. –––––––––––––––––––––– 27. Donna Murphy, global CEO, Havas Health Donna Murphy has spent much of the past year trying to better align Havas Health's capabilities with growing client demands. Judging by the company's recent maneuvers, it's a task she has embraced. In June 2015, the firm acquired Just:: Health Communications, a London-based PR shop it renamed Havas Just::. Three months later, Havas Health launched a consultancy named Xigxag. See also: 3 questions for 5 of the agency's world's leading executives In November, the company picked up med-ed agency Symbiotix, a deal that added 45 employees to the agency's roster. Finally, in February 2016, Havas Health announced it would partner with Vencore Health Analytics to expand usage of Vencore's patient-finder technology, which identifies clinical trial candidates with rare diseases. In July, Murphy told MM&M Havas Health aims to remain hyper-focused on results-oriented solutions. "We will continue to push diversification so our ability to solve problems across the complex health matrix is comprehensive and unparalleled," she said. "Changes in healthcare are not stopping, so you can be sure we won't stop, either." –––––––––––––––––––––– 26. Eileen Sheil, executive director, corporate communications, Cleveland Clinic By Johna Burke, EVP, BurrellesLuce Two of the most highly considered traits of an effective communicator are "taking the complex and making it simple" and using research and measurement to guide strategy. Working in the ever-changing and incredibly complex world of healthcare, Eileen is superb at working with the media. See also: Cleveland Clinic aims to get guys talking in first men's health campaign To the benefit of both the clinic and its patients, she embraces challenging topics. One example is the March 2016 story about America's first uterus transplant. Women facing infertility watched with eager anticipation and could clearly understand the process, challenges, and unfortunate disappointment as they followed the story and progress of this case. A technical and emotionally charged issue was communicated clearly and effectively, in no small part owing to Eileen's leadership at the Cleveland Clinic. Her communications strategy is based on research, and the clinic measures progress in outputs, outcomes, and organizational results on an ongoing basis. She also is a global leader on the need to use research as part of communications. I work with Eileen through AMEC, where she co-chairs the AMEC nonprofit group. Its goal is to bring better communications research and measurement to nonprofits. So her exceptional work at the Cleveland Clinic is not an anomaly, but rather a trend that reinforces the value and strength of her quiet and thoughtful leadership style. Her expertise and style are unmatched, whether she is promoting global nonprofit's comms efforts or clearly communicating a complex medical procedure. –––––––––––––––––––––– 25. Chuck Greener, SVP, global communications and corporate affairs, Walgreens Boots Alliance By Yves Romestan, SVP, communications and international affairs, Walgreens Boots Alliance In-depth knowledge, industry expertise, and intense motivation are some of the key characteristics of any fine influencer. But the true essence of Chuck ­Greener's influence lies much deeper, starting with his ability to bridge gaps and bring people together. For me, Henry Ford's famous "Coming together is a beginning, keeping together is progress, working together is success" lies behind Chuck's influence. Chuck is an outstanding expert in U.S. public affairs and a gifted communicator. From advising the Reagan administration to serving Walgreens Boots Alliance, Chuck has always demonstrated that effective and innovative communications has the ability to powerfully engage and empower stakeholders. Passionate about bringing people together and developing meaningful projects wherever he goes, Chuck always pulls it off by involving and listening to those around him, as well as by creating strong dynamics for everyone to work toward. Brilliant at public speaking, Chuck is also driven by a strong set of personal and professional values. It is impossible to list all of Chuck's achievements, but his contribution to the successful merger of Walgreens and Alliance Boots into the formation of Walgreens Boots Alliance was outstanding. I feel privileged to know a loyal, committed, and talented gentleman I am proud to call a great friend and business partner. –––––––––––––––––––––– 24. Dana Maiman, CEO and president, FCB Health While no big-agency chief lacked big-picture challenges during the tumultuous past two years, FCB Health's Dana Maiman had perhaps the most difficult with which to contend: In March 2015, FCB and McCann Health parent, Interpublic Group, eliminated its third health-marketing network, ICC Lowe, and folded its three brands into FCB. The unexpected move delivered some 275 employees and a raft of potential client conflicts onto Maiman's doorstep. She didn't so much as blink. Nearly two years later, FCB has smoothly integrated the entirety of the former ICC Lowe operation. See also: ICC and Pace merge, renamed Cure Two brands were united as FCBCure, while the other was recast as a med-ed specialty shop. In the process, it blew past the 800-employee and $140 million milestones, expanding its relationships with A-listers including Novartis, Teva, and Amgen. The secret to Maiman's success lies in her approachability and flexibility. Every agency leader claims a warm connection with employees up and down the company organizational chart, but Maiman actually walks the walk. She's also hands-on with FCB clients — in a good way. Asked last year by MM&M about the pros and cons of working with biotech startups compared with pharma monoliths, Maiman doesn't take the bait. "Come on. Do you have more than one kid? Even if you have 20, you find something awesome and adorable about each one." –––––––––––––––––––––– 23. Elaine Leavenworth, SVP, chief marketing and external affairs officer, Abbott Since Elaine Leavenworth assumed her current role as SVP, and chief marketing and external affairs officer in 2014, Abbott has overtaken a number of memorable consumer efforts. The company grew its rehydration fluid, PediaLyte, audience in 2015 by focusing on See the Lyte, a spot that features clever ways of showing how it fits into adult lifestyles. During her tenure, Abbott struck gold again for Similac, with the Sisterhood of Motherhood, whose video featured a playground confrontation between different kinds of moms and attracted nearly 6 million views in less than two weeks. Beyond her marketing efforts, Leavenworth is, by any account, deeply embedded within her community and her company's philanthropic efforts. During her 25-year career at Abbott, she has held roles from manager of strategic planning to licensing and new business development, VP of government affairs, and division president of Abbott health systems. –––––––––––––––––––––– 22. Carolyn Castel, VP, corporate communications, CVS Health Carolyn Castel has spearheaded comms during CVS' game-changing announcement to cease selling tobacco products in 2014. More recently, CVS began replacing 25% of candy at the front end with healthier snacks. Castel, a 10-year CVS veteran, has also had to shape messaging around the company's decision to add 35 products to its list of excluded drugs in 2017 due to “hyperinflation” in pricing in favor of lower-priced alternatives. See also: PBMs unveil 2017 formularies, retain focus on exclusions Early on, Castel played a key role in defining CVS Caremark's message around its evolution — from CVS, a top drugstore chain, to CVS Caremark, a pharmacy healthcare provider with $139.4 billion in annual revenue in 2015. Castel leads the company's efforts in corporate reputation, media relations, crisis planning and issues management, and CSR. Prior to working at CVS, she was SVP, corporate and public affairs, at Edelman. –––––––––––––––––––––– 21. Julie Gerberding, EVP, chief patient officer, strategic comms, global public policy and population health, Merck Julie Gerberding's career has spanned the health system. After starting her career in academia at the University of California, San Francisco, Gerberding went on to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as its director from 2002 to 2009.

Photo credit: King-of-Herrings/Creative Commons Drugmakers took issue with the design of two planned FDA studies examining the use of animation in direct-to-consumer advertising, according to comment letters released this week. The FDA had announced plans to study the use of superimposed text and animation in DTC advertising. The agency said it hopes the studies will answer two questions: Do consumers process ads with animation differently? And is consumer understanding affected when animation is used to personify a disease, a drug's benefit, or the patient? The FDA first posted a notice in March asking for public comment on how it will conduct this research. That comment period ended in May. The notice published earlier this week is to allow for comment on that proposed collection, which includes both industry comments and the agency's responses to their input.  The FDA, in the proposed guidance, said it would look at how rotoscoping or live action animation is used in DTC ads, with plans to ask participants about the uncanny valley hypothesis or whether they felt that live action animation elicits a feeling of eeriness in viewers. See also: The FDA wants to study DTC tactics One recent example of this is Allergan and Ironwood Pharmaceuticals' ad for IBS-C treatment Linzess, which used live action animation to show the different ways the disease affects a patient's daily life. Eli Lilly criticized that question in a comment letter, calling it “leading” and saying “it directs participants to respond only negatively about their perceptions of the character.” Citing the uncanny valley hypothesis, the FDA responded that it felt it was crucial to keep the question. Merck also weighed, saying that results from this research “may not translate readily into FDA DTC policy/guidance” because the research largely addresses how the execution of certain kinds of animation affects perception. The FDA responded by saying that it needs to build a foundation of research on this subject “because there is no previous research of this kind. This will be an informative study that will help FDA develop guidance and policy in the future, should the research reveal a need to.” See also: Industry criticizes FDA's proposed DTC studies Another drugmaker, GlaxoSmithKline, said the research may be reductive because it “oversimplifies animation by not incorporating multiple types of animation or examining ads that are 100% versus partially animated” and because of that “is unlikely to yield any general conclusions about the use of animation.” The FDA said that it is using a “reasonable” number of variations including full animation and rotoscoping, saying it will “ensure that our conclusions are reasonable.” The comment period highlights tension between the FDA and the pharma industry over the extent to which regulatory research should inform new policy and to what degree animation affects consumer perception. The industry levied criticism at the agency over its word choice for some survey questions, the extrapolation of this study's results into policy, and oversimplifying animation by not incorporating multiple types of the tactic. The full comments from the industry and responses by the FDA can be read here. Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the drug advertised by Allergan and Ironwood Pharmaceuticals using live-action animation. It is Linzess, not Viberzi.  Share this content: facebook twitter linkedin google Comments Print Similar Articles FDA to study DTC ads Drugmakers eye growing IBS market with DTC push Industry criticizes FDA's proposed DTC studies The FDA wants to study DTC tactics The FDA warns drugmakers over promotion of experimental opioid Related Topics DTC FDA Pharma Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Kendall Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is home to 800 companies, from startups to MIT. Even Google and Microsoft have satellite offices there. Once a salt marsh and the former home of a NASA research center, Kendall Square today is known as "the most innovative square mile" in America, based on the concentration of innovative businesses in the area. Collectively, they have raised $14 billion. As Kendall Square continues to be the place where entrepreneurs and inventors are making their mark in the world, here are three game changers of the "Miracle Mile" that are using technology to help us live longer, stay healthier and work out better. WHOOP Read More Chances are you are one of the 50-plus million people who own a popular activity tracker such as a Fitbit or Jawbone. The devices have created a workout frenzy encouraging regular people to participate in physical activity, and it can become competitive. But, what about a device for those who compete for a living? Athletes. Until now, there was nothing on the market to track an athlete's training. Then WHOOP, the first scientifically-grounded device specifically designed to help elite athletes perform at an ultimate level, debuted in the fall of 2015. Worn on the wrist, WHOOP monitors an athlete's heart rate, ambient temperature, accelerometry and other vitals 100 times a second. Those factors determine an athlete's strain, sleep and recovery. Founder and CEO Will Ahmed believes that athletes may overlook those factors because there's a thin line between over training and training optimally. He says WHOOP's goal is to empower athletes and help them understand their bodies.

After natural microbes were added to seeds, the results showed a significant yield increase. Hide Caption 9 of 9 A digital dashboard allows coaches, trainers and athletes to monitor an athlete's training level. When training is complete, a color-coded recovery score is given, which determines if an athlete should continue or let their body rest. "When we started WHOOP we uncovered that there are a lot of biomarkers that predict how you're going to perform," says Ahmed. "Feelings in general aren't a very good predictor of your body's performance." NBA champion LeBron James, Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps and about 20 other professional and Olympic athletes have trained using WHOOP. College athletic programs train with the device as well. "We started using WHOOP in the middle of September and this is the healthiest we've been as a team," says Roy Coates, Northeastern swim team head coach. "It plays a huge factor in our success as a team." A recent study of 120 college athletes showed that when athletes used WHOOP, they gained an average of 41 more minutes of sleep and reduced their alcohol consumption by 76%. "You have to budget your time wisely because coaches can see everything you're doing," says Carly Schnabel, Northeastern women's swim team member. If you're not a professional or collegiate athlete and you want to get your hands on a WHOOP, there's good news. WHOOP announced last July that their WHOOP Strap 2.0 would be available to the general public at the end of this year. Moderna JUST WATCHED Is this the cure to cancer? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Is this the cure to cancer? 03:28 Will there ever be a cure for cancer or HIV? That's the question most of the world has been asking. One biotech company, Moderna, believes they are one step closer to finding a remedy. In fact, Moderna says the cure may be right in front of our eyes. "Your body is going to be the factory for your medicine," says Moderna's CEO Stephane Bancel. When someone becomes ill, Bancel says, it is usually due to the lack of a protein, which is then treated with a synthetic protein-based drug. However, those drugs are not always effective in curing the disease. Founded in 2011, Moderna says its technology will not only replace the missing protein but will swap it with a more natural protein. "Now we can have therapeutic proteins functioning inside cells," Tal Zaks, chief medical officer says. "And that's a huge difference." So, how will an emerging biotech startup be able to do what doctors have been unable to do for centuries? How will they change the makeup of proteins? By using Messenger RNA or mRNA. Messenger RNA is the molecules found in cells that carries the code for a particular protein and acts as a template for the formation of that protein. Moderna's technology will change the property of the mRNA molecules, then the mRNA will be injected into the body, theoretically allowing your cells to make any protein it needs to heal itself from a specific disease. "We are very focused on infectious disease," Bancel added. "Then we are trying to see if we could make personalized cancer vaccines." How Cuba is battling lung cancer with a vaccine Last June, Moderna announced a partnership with Merck to develop an mRNA-based personalized cancer vaccine with clinical studies anticipated to begin next year. Last July the company signed a deal with Vertex to create therapies for cystic fibrosis. With over $1.5 billion raised for research and development, including $20 million from the Gates Foundation to fight HIV, Moderna is establishing itself as a leader in clinical studies. An unprecedented two clinical studies are currently underway including a study with AstraZeneca on the experimental drug AZD8601, which treats vascular disease. With their ambitious work underway and the research continuing, the end results could potentially mean the end of devastating illnesses. "The next couple of years for us will be really transformational," Zaks says. Indigo JUST WATCHED Scientists grow natural supercrops to feed the planet Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Scientists grow natural supercrops to feed the planet 03:31 Ten billion. That's Earth's estimated population in 2050. That means 10 billion people will be consuming the Earth's food and water supply at the same time. In order to provide enough food and water for the population, agriculture productivity and water conservation needs to increase by 70%. Are we prepared? Tech startup Indigo says no, we are not. They however may have discovered an innovative way to meet the world's food and water needs. After studying human microbiomes found in or on the body that promote digestion and reproduction, scientists at Indigo studied microbiomes found in plants. The results showed that when added to a seed coding, microbes naturally found in plants have a positive effect on a plant's water stress tolerance as well as its resistance to certain insects and fungi. "It's almost like we've discovered a whole new organ inside of plants," says co-founder Geoffrey Ian von Maltzahn. "Now we have the tools to figure out what it's doing." After their discovery, more than a dozen plants were tested in various climate conditions during all seasons. When natural microbes were added, the results showed a 10% yield increase. How significant is that? With 75% of the Earth's food coming from just a dozen plants and five animals, that number is a game changer. "A 10% increase is a whole decade leap forward in terms of productivity," says CEO David Perry. The agricultural industry has taken notice of Indigo's groundbreaking advancements. Last July, the company announced that it received a record-breaking $100 million Series C investment. The investment will not only support Indigo's current and future research, but supports the newly launched Indigo Cotton, the company's first commercial product, which aims to increase water efficiency. Growing beyond its Kendall Square roots, Indigo is now housed in a 65,000-square-foot facility just a few miles north of its original hub. The company says it is preparing for growth -- expecting to double the size of its team as it strives to feed the world. Content by LendingTree Rates hit 2.75% APR (15 yr).

Posted 29 Oct 2016 05:06 Updated 29 Oct 2016 05:35 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. (Photo: AFP/Drew Angerer) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: US stocks dropped with a jolt on Friday (Oct 28) after news that the FBI reopened a probe into Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state. US stocks had been comfortably in positive territory prior to news that Federal Bureau of Investigation head James Comey informed lawmakers that he was restarting the probe. Clinton has been the market's preferred choice compared with Republican Donald Trump, viewed by many investors as unpredictable. Analysts said the news raises the chances of a Trump win, after weeks during which Clinton handily led the polls. "One of the things we felt more certain about over the course of the last week or two has been the result at the top of the ballot, and this probably throws that into question," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. "That's not going to be good for markets." The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 8.49 points (0.05 per cent) at 18,161.19. The broad-based S&P 500 declined 6.63 points (0.31 per cent) at 2,126.41, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index shed 25.87 points (0.50 per cent) to 5,190.10. The dollar plunged against all the major currencies after the FBI announcement, but regained some territory before the close. The Mexican peso sank against the dollar but also later rebounded slightly. The Clinton news followed the release of official data showing the US economy grew at a better-than-expected 2.9 per cent pace in the third quarter, data that weighed against Trump, who has repeatedly called the economy "broken". Health care stocks were hit hard after drugmakers Amgen and McKesson both highlighted an increasingly cutthroat pharmaceutical pricing environment. Amgen slumped 9.6 per cent and McKesson dived 22.7 per cent. Other health stocks to fall included Merck, down 4.0 per cent, drugstore chain CVS Health, down 4.4 per cent and pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts, down 6.0 per cent. Amazon sank 5.2 per cent after it reported earnings that translated into 52 cents per share, much below the analyst forecast for 78 cents, as a ramp-up in investment caught investors off guard. Chevron jumped 3.9 per cent after it reported that third-quarter profits fell 36.8 per cent to US$1.3 billion. The results bested analyst expectations and marked a big improvement over the first two quarters of 2016, when it reported losses. ExxonMobil however fell 2.5 per cent as it reported a 37.5 per cent drop in third-quarter earnings to US$2.7 billion. The oil giant warned it might have to cut its estimate of its commercially viable reserves by nearly 20 per cent due to low oil prices. Among other companies reporting earnings, Goodyear Tire & Rubber slumped 9.0 per cent, Baidu rose 2.6 per cent and Expedia gained 4.1 per cent. Google parent Alphabet was flat after reporting better-than-expected results. TROUBLED OPEC TALK HIT OIL Meanwhile oil prices were hit with a double whammy of the FBI news and uncertainty over OPEC's ability to negotiate production limits and win the cooperation of non-cartel producers. The Brent price dropped back below $50 as talks in Vienna failed to work out details of the tentative deal reached last month, although they are expected to continue over the weekend. "We've got some news out of OPEC and things are still very complicating and it sounds like the agreement to come to some sort of freeze or cut is likely not going to happen," said Oliver Sloup of iiTrader.com. European markets wobbled ahead of a raft of data and policy decisions in the week ahead. Frankfurt, London and Paris diverged, while in Asia, Hong Kong and Shanghai ended just down and Tokyo up marginally. The Bank of Japan and the Reserve Bank of Australia will deliver their latest interest rate calls Tuesday, followed by the US Federal Reserve Wednesday and the Bank of England Thursday. The eurozone releases third quarter GDP Monday, and the US releases the critical October jobs report Friday. - AFP/ec Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

ExxonMobil however fell 2.5 percent as it reported a 37.5 percent drop in third-quarter earnings to $2.7 billion. The oil giant warned it might have to cut its estimate of its commercially viable reserves by nearly 20 percent due to low oil prices. Among other companies reporting earnings, Goodyear Tire & Rubber slumped 9.0 percent, Baidu rose 2.6 percent and Expedia gained 4.1 percent.

The drugmaker said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had placed a partial hold on enrolment into the final-stage Phase III trials involving two of its immune system-boosting drugs, although the studies are still continuing with existing patients. Trials of durvalumab and tremelimumab in different cancer types are also progressing as planned. Durvalumab is being tested on its own and with tremelimumab in various cancers. Expectations for the combination treatment have been building in particular in lung cancer, where the two-drug cocktail is being tested in a broad range of patients as an alternative to initial chemotherapy. News of the problems in head and neck cancer first surfaced on the website clinicaltrials.gov, run by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, which said one of the trials, known as KESTREL, had been "suspended".

"We have a pause or a partial clinical hold on enrolment of new patients." Shares in AstraZeneca fell more than 4 percent in U.S. trading on concerns that the setback might signal wider problems for durvalumab. AstraZeneca sought to play down concerns, however, stressing that pivotal data in lung cancer were still expected in the first half of 2017. It also said that bleeding was a known complication in treating head and neck cancer, given the proximity of tumors to major blood vessels and use of prior cancer therapies, which may involve surgery and radiation. Merck's rival immunotherapy drug Keytruda is already approved for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, the same condition that AstraZeneca is testing for. Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said there was some reference in the medical literature to a decrease in blood platelets, which are needed for clotting, when patients were given so-called CTLA4 drugs like tremelimumab, although cases were rare. Both Anderson and Deutsche Bank's Richard Parkes said it was unclear if bleeding constituted a real drug side effect or not. AstraZeneca said it had submitted its analysis of bleeding events to the FDA for review and would work to provide the required information to resume new patient enrolment as soon as possible.

Only 19 new molecular entity drugs have been approved year-to-date compared to 32 approved during the same time frame last year. For the uninitiated, a new molecular entity, or NME in short, is an active ingredient that has never before been marketed in the United States in any form. Stock market showing of biotech stocks in October isn't inspiring. The NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index has slid 10.81 percent thus far this year compared to a more modest 1.16 percent drop by the broader S&P 500 Index and a 0.5 percent slippage by the Nasdaq Composite Index. The underperformance may have something to do with the widely expected U.S. Presidential results. Hillary Clinton at the White House may mean a clampdown on biotech companies, which unscrupulously price their products for life threatening drugs. Two power-packed tweets regarding pricing of drugs sent out by the Democratic Party's Presidential candidate served to wreak havoc for two pertinent companies, namely Mylan (MYL) and Turing Pharmaceuticals LLC. Even as macroeconomic headwinds remain, this time and capital-intensive industry is gambling big time over novel products and technologies, giving them the status of risky bets. In October, only 2 new molecular entity drugs were greenlighted by the FDA. The two lucky novel drugs are Eli Lilly & Co.'s (LLY) Lartruvo and Merck's (MRK) Zinplava. Lartruvo is approved for use with chemotherapy drug doxorubicin in adults with certain types of soft tissue sarcoma while Zinplava is approved to reduce recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection. However, Nicox and Egalet Corp. (EGLT), which faced the FDA in October, were not so lucky. The regulator turned down Nicox's application seeking approval of AC-170 for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis while it sought more time to review Egalet's abuse-deterrent opioid medicine Arymo ER, extending the deadline of October 14, 2016. As we head into November, it's time to take a look at the upcoming FDA decisions of the month.

The partial hold - which means the trials are closed to new recruitment but will continue with the existing patients - applies to trials of the drug both alone and in combination with AZ's tremelimumab in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). It has been prompted by bleeding side effects "that were observed as part of routine safety monitoring of the phase III KESTREL and EAGLE trials," said AZ in a statement, adding that it submitted an analysis of the events to the FDA and will try to resume patient recruitment "as soon as possible". The drugmaker says that bleeding complications are known to be features of head and neck cancers "due to the nature of the underlying disease, the proximity of tumours to major blood vessels and use of prior cancer therapies, which may involve surgery and radiation". KESTREL is comparing durvalumab and tremelimumab in combination or durvalumab monotherapy to Eli Lilly's Erbitux (cetuximab) plus chemotherapy, while EAGLE is comparing the same two AZ regimens with the standard of care selected by the physician. AZ's shares fell almost 4% as news of the enrolment suspension broke late in the day yesterday and continued on the downward path this morning as investors tried to work out the significance of the announcement. The decline reflects the importance attached to durvalumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor that AZ is hoping will join two PD-1 inhibitors - Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo (nivolumab) and Merck & Co's Keytruda (pembrolizumab) - and Roche's PD-L1 inhibitor Tecentriq (atezolizumab) that are already on the market. Along with CTLA4 inhibitor tremelimumab, durvalumab is a key component of AZ's aspirations in immuno-oncology, an emerging cancer treatment category expected to be worth tens of billions of dollars a year in the future.

A faster kidney transplant, but with hep C Lauran Neergaard, Associated Press 9:13 p.m. EDT October 27, 2016 In this photo taken Oct. 13, 2016, Irma Hendricks poses for a portrait with her grandson, C.J., at her home in East Stroudsburg, Pa. Hendricks received a kidney transplant from a donor with hepatitis C, and took medications after surgery that cleared away the virus and left her feeling healthy again. Hendricks is part of a pilot study testing if new drugs that promise to cure most hepatitis C could allow use of organs that today go to waste, and speed transplants to people who might otherwise die waiting. (AP Photo/Michael Rubinkam) (Photo: Michael Rubinkam / AP) Washington — A bold experiment is giving some patients a chance at cutting years off their wait for a kidney transplant if they agree to a drastic-sounding option — getting an organ almost sure to infect them with hepatitis C. Betting on new medications that promise to cure hepatitis C, two leading transplant centers aim to use organs that today go to waste, a bid to put a dent in the nation’s long transplant waiting list. Pilot studies are underway at the University of Pennsylvania and Johns Hopkins University to test transplanting kidneys from deceased donors with hepatitis C into recipients who don’t already have that virus. If the groundbreaking research eventually pans out, hundreds more kidneys — and maybe some hearts and lungs, too — could be transplanted every year. “We always dreaded hepatitis C,” said Dr. Peter Reese, a Penn kidney specialist who is helping lead the research. “But now hepatitis C is just a different disease,” enough to consider what he calls the trade-off of getting a new kidney years faster but one that comes with a hopefully treatable infection. It’s a trade-off prompted by an organ shortage. More than 99,000 people are on the national kidney waiting list, but only about 17,000 people a year get a transplant and 4 percent a year die waiting, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). “If we had enough organs, we wouldn’t do this,” said Dr. Niraj Desai, who is leading the Hopkins study. But, Desai said, “most patients are pretty open to the idea once they hear what the alternatives are.” Doctors had told 66-year-old Irma Hendricks of East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, to expect at least a five-year wait for a kidney transplant. Dialysis three times a week was keeping her alive, but leaving her with no energy for even routine activities. “I call it the zombie syndrome,” she said. She jumped at the chance to enroll in Penn’s study, even though doctors made clear they hoped for but couldn’t guarantee a hepatitis cure. “My son said, ‘Mom, this is a no-brainer. Just do it,’” Hendricks said. She swallowed an anti-hepatitis pill daily for three months, in addition to the usual post-transplant medications. Testing showed the drugs rapidly cleared hepatitis C out of her bloodstream. With her new kidney functioning well, she now has enough energy to play with her toddler grandson. “This is giving people in my situation new hope,” Hendricks said. Kidney transplant specialists are closely watching the research. “It makes sense to me,” said Dr. Matthew Cooper, a transplant surgeon at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital who is not involved in the research. He cautioned that the studies should use only kidneys that are young and otherwise high-quality, and that patients must understand the risks. “They need to know you place their safety as the highest priority,” Cooper said. “But at the same time, recognize that we have these obstacles. We don’t want people to die on dialysis, and there are not enough organs available for everybody.” Hepatitis C is a simmering infection that, if untreated, over two to three decades can quietly destroy someone’s liver. At least 2.7 million people in the United States have chronic hepatitis C. Until a few years ago, it was treatable only by medications with grueling side effects and poor cure rates. Now, breakthrough drugs promise to cure 95 percent of hepatitis C cases with fewer side effects — for people who can afford them. Treatment costs tens of thousands of dollars. Normally, hepatitis C-infected organs are transplanted only into patients who already have hepatitis C themselves, so as not to further spread the virus. Giving hepatitis C-positive organs to hepatitis C-negative recipients is allowed if the patient agrees, but it’s rare, said Dr. David Klassen, UNOS’ chief medical officer. UNOS statistics show a few dozen such transplants, mostly kidneys, last year, presumably when doctors feared their patients wouldn’t survive the wait for a healthier organ. More often, hospitals discard hepatitis C-infected organs. Reese and fellow Penn physician Dr. David Goldberg found only 37 percent of hepatitis C-positive kidney donations between 2005 and 2014 were transplanted. The discards could have helped more than 4,000 patients during that time period, they reported in the New England Journal of Medicine last year. The opioid epidemic is prompting a jump in donations from people who died of drug overdoses — typically young organs that, absent an infection risk, would be sought after. The small Penn and Hopkins trials are a first step. Much larger studies are needed to prove whether more routine use of these organs in immune-suppressed transplant recipients really works. Cost also is a question. Merck & Co. is helping to fund the pilot trials, donating its medication Zepatier, which costs $54,000 for a round of treatment. That’s still cheaper than a lifetime of a dialysis, which costs about $75,000 a year, UNOS’ Klassen noted. While the studies began with kidneys because of their demand, “I don’t think there’s any reason, if it proves safe and effective in kidneys, that we wouldn’t want to try it in other organs,” Penn’s Goldberg noted. Even if the hepatitis C-infected organs prove useful, the nation still is “desperate for more donors,” cautioned Hopkins’ Desai. “It’s a practical solution to help some of the people. It won’t solve the problem.” 11 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
