Get all of our free blog coverage and more by clicking on the link below: http://www.activewallst.com/registration-3/?symbol=TEVA http://www.activewallst.com/registration-3/?symbol=MRK Breaking down Daptomycin Daptomycin for injection is an antibacterial drug and is also known as CUBICIN, a flagship Merck product. It finds its application among adults and is used for the treatment of several complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI). Secreted from the susceptible isolates of Gram-positive bacteria, it is indicated in adults for the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (bacteremia), inclusive of right-sided infective endocarditis, caused by methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant isolates. Daptomycin possesses a distinct mechanism of action where it disrupts the multiple aspects of bacterial cell membrane function. It inserts into the cell membrane, where it then aggregates. Ultimately, the aggregation alters the curvature of the membrane, leading to hole creation which facilitate leak of ions. As a result, rapid depolarization takes place which results in loss of membrane potential leading to the bacterial cell death. According to the IMS data, as of July 2016, Daptomycin for injection garnered annual sales of approximately $1.2 billion in the US. The generic drug harbinger Teva Pharmaceutical is an Israel-based, multinational pharmaceutical company. Although it ventures in several active pharmaceutical ingredients and proprietary pharmaceuticals, Teva primarily specializes in generic drugs and is the world leader in the sector with $9.5 billion earnings last year. With the launch of this generic injectable drug, Teva aims at strengthening its stance in the pharmaceutical industry while maintaining its status as the biggest generic drug company. The generic drug industry has viewed another announcement from the Israeli drug maker. On September 9, 2016, Teva Pharmaceuticals stated that it aims to win US approval by late 2017 or early 2018 for its version of Mylan’s N.V.’s EpiPen device for treating severe allergic reactions. The price of EpiPen has soared from $100 to more than $600 since, Mylan acquired it in 2007. Mylan’s EpiPen holds 94% of about $1.3 billion of epinephrine pen market share, owing to the absence of strong competitors. Hence, Teva aims to beat out a chunk of the share with its own copycat version of the drug. Wall Street’s analysts have predicted that Teva’s product, if priced cheaper than EpiPen and approved, could eat up the branded product’s market.&nbsp; Stock Performance Teva Pharma’s stock is trading slightly down by 0.10%, closing Thursday’s session at $51.90 on volume of 3.53 million shares. Shares of the company have gained 0.05% in the last three months. The company’s shares have a PE ratio of 34.65 and a dividend yield of 2.62%. Merck’s share price finished yesterday’s trading session at $62.38, climbing 1.68%. A total volume of 9.02 million shares exchanged hands. The stock has advanced 9.28% and 22.94% in the last three months and past six months, respectively. Furthermore, since the start of the year, shares of the company have gained 20.99%. The stock is trading at a PE ratio of 34.16 and a dividend yield of 2.95%.&nbsp; Active Wall Street: Active Wall Street (AWS) produces regular sponsored and non-sponsored reports, articles, stock market blogs, and popular investment newsletters covering equities listed on NYSE and NASDAQ and micro-cap stocks.

DARMSTADT, Germany, September 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ - Merck, a leading science and technology company, announced they presented new efficacy data for investigational Cladribine Tablets in two oral presentations at the 32nd Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) taking place September 14-17, 2016, in London. The findings, from the phase III CLARITY and CLARITY EXTENSION trials and from the open-label maintenance period of the phase III ORACLE-MS study, demonstrated durable efficacy of Cladribine Tablets in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) along with a well-characterized safety profile. CLARITY and CLARITY EXTENSION studies confirmed that 20 days of oral dosing over two years was effective in reducing the frequency of relapses and slowing disability progression for up to four years. "The results presented this week show that the clinical benefits of Cladribine Tablets can be maintained in most patients for an additional two years without the need for redosing," said Dr. Giancarlo Comi, Professor of Neurology, Chairman of the Department of Neurology, and Director of the Institute of Experimental Neurology, at Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Scientific Institute San Raffaele, Milan and a lead investigator in the studies. "Although multiple therapies are available for patients with MS, there is still a large unmet need within this patient community, including for therapies that offer lasting benefits." In one oral presentation, data from the two-year phase III CLARITY trial and its two-year extension study (CLARITY EXTENSION) showed that patients with relapsing MS who received placebo in CLARITY and were switched to Cladribine Tablets in CLARITY EXTENSION had significantly reduced annualised relapse rates (ARR) (0.26 vs. 0.10, P<0.0001) and were significantly more likely to be relapse free (58.0 percent vs. 79.6 percent, P<0.0001) at the end of the extension phase. ARR were maintained for patients who received Cladribine Tablets for two years in CLARITY and were then switched to placebo for two years in the extension phase. The second oral presentation reported data from the open-label maintenance period of the phase III ORACLE-MS study. ORACLE-MS showed that, for patients with a first demyelinating event, treatment with Cladribine Tablets significantly reduced the risk of progression to clinically definite MS compared with placebo. For the open-label portion of the study, patients who converted to clinically definite MS during the initial treatment period were switched to Rebif® therapy. The new data presented at ECTRIMS show that patients who had received Cladribine Tablets in the initial treatment phase had lower ARR over the maintenance period (median time on Rebif = 56.0 weeks) compared with those who had received placebo in the initial treatment phase [0.14 for Cladribine Tablets 3.5 mg/kg (n=25), 0.24 for Cladribine Tablets 5.25 mg/kg (n=24) and 0.42 for placebo (n=60)]. "Cladribine Tablets has a unique oral dosing schedule, with just two short treatment courses administered orally in years one and two. Together with more than 10,000 patient years of safety data and phase III efficacy data, these findings of lasting reductions in relapse rates support our belief that, if approved, Cladribine Tablets may serve as an important new advance for patients with relapsing-remitting MS," said Luciano Rossetti, Head of Global R&D for the Biopharma business of Merck. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has accepted for review the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) of the investigational product Cladribine Tablets for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. About Cladribine Tablets Cladribine Tablets is an oral small molecule prodrug that selectively and periodically targets lymphocytes thought to be integral to the pathological process of MS. Cladribine Tablets is currently under clinical investigation and not approved for any use in the United States, Canada and Europe. About Rebif® Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is a disease-modifying drug used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is similar to the interferon beta protein produced by the human body. The efficacy of Rebif® in chronic progressive MS has not been established. Interferon ß is thought to help reduce inflammation. The exact mechanism is unknown. Rebif®, which was approved in Europe in 1998 and in the US in 2002, is registered in more than 90 countries worldwide. Rebif® has been proven to delay the progression of disability, reduce the frequency of relapses and reduce MRI lesion activity and area*. Rebif® can be administrated with the RebiSmart® electronic auto-injection device (not approved in the US), or with the RebiDose® single-use disposable pen, or the manual multidose injection pen RebiSlide™. Rebif® can also be administered with the autoinjector Rebiject II® or by manual injection using ready-to-use pre-filled syringes. These injection devices are not approved in all countries. In January 2012, the European commission approved the extension of the indication of Rebif® in early multiple sclerosis. The extension of the indication of Rebif® has not been submitted in the United States. Rebif® should be used with caution in patients with a history of depression, liver disease, thyroid abnormalities and seizures. Most commonly reported side effects are flu-like symptoms, injection site disorders, elevation of liver enzymes and blood cell abnormalities. Patients, especially those with depression, seizure disorders, or liver problems, should discuss treatment with Rebif® with their doctors. *The exact correlation between MRI findings and the current or future clinical status of patients, including disability progression, is unknown. Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is approved in the United States for relapsing forms of MS. RebiSmart®, an electronic device for self-injection of Rebif®, is also not approved in the United States. Cladribine Tablets is an investigational product and not approved for use in any indication in the United States.

The latest results of the ZOE-50 trial - published in the New England Journal of Medicine - suggest that Shingrix (HZ/su) maintains a high level of efficacy in a group that does not respond so well to Merck & Co's Zostavax, the only approved shingles vaccine on the market. Armed with the new data, GSK has confirmed it will press ahead with regulatory applications before the end of the year, setting it on course for possible approvals in 2017. If it can get the long-term efficacy data on the label that could give it a marketing edge over Zostavax, and a chance to quickly capture market share for Merck's drug. Zostavax was a $750m product for Merck last year, but started to see sales fall back marginally after benefiting from a major direct-to-consumer (DTC) ad campaign in the US in 2014 and as a result of reimbursement barriers in some markets. Shingles is an extremely painful infection caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV), the same one that causes chickenpox. While the immune system can generally shake off the symptoms of chickenpox, the virus lies dormant and can reawaken if a person becomes immune-suppressed to cause painful skin lesions. It is increasingly common with advancing age. In some cases it leads to painkiller-resistant pain (post-herpetic neuralgia) that does not resolve after the skin lesions have healed and can last for years. In the latest analysis Shingrix was also shown to reduce the risk of PHN by 89% in people aged 70 or more. "This is the first time that such high efficacy has been demonstrated in a vaccine candidate for older people," said Dr Emmanuel Hanon, senior vice president for vaccines R&D at GSK. If approved, Shingrix could become "an important tool for the prevention of shingles and the pain associated with it, which would significantly impact the health and quality of life of so many people," he added. GSK's vaccine is based on a protein called gE found on VZV, while Zostavaz is a live, attenuated form of the virus. Analysts have suggested it could become a $1bn product for GSK, which has said it is among several late-stage candidates that are predicted to add £6bn in revenues by 2020. An editorial accompanying the NEJM article notes that shingles develops in around 500,000 people aged over 60 in the US each year, and preventing this in older people "should be a public health priority".

Go to Search More news Merck Presents New Data Examining Press Releases September 16, 13:40 UTC+3 Phase III studies highlight lasting reductions in relapse rates for an additional two years following short oral treatment courses in year one & year two with Cladribine Tablets Share 1 pages in this article DARMSTADT, Germany, September 16, 2016/PRNewswire/. Merck, a leading science and technology company, announced they presented new efficacy data for investigational Cladribine Tablets in two oral presentations at the 32nd Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) taking place September 14-17, 2016, in London. The findings, from the phase III CLARITY and CLARITY EXTENSION trials and from the open-label maintenance period of the phase III ORACLE-MS study, demonstrated durable efficacy of Cladribine Tablets in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) along with a well-characterized safety profile. CLARITY and CLARITY EXTENSION studies confirmed that 20 days of oral dosing over two years was effective in reducing the frequency of relapses and slowing disability progression for up to four years. "The results presented this week show that the clinical benefits of Cladribine Tablets can be maintained in most patients for an additional two years without the need for redosing," said Dr. Giancarlo Comi, Professor of Neurology, Chairman of the Department of Neurology, and Director of the Institute of Experimental Neurology, at Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Scientific Institute San Raffaele, Milan and a lead investigator in the studies. "Although multiple therapies are available for patients with MS, there is still a large unmet need within this patient community, including for therapies that offer lasting benefits." In one oral presentation, data from the two-year phase III CLARITY trial and its two-year extension study (CLARITY EXTENSION) showed that patients with relapsing MS who received placebo in CLARITY and were switched to Cladribine Tablets in CLARITY EXTENSION had significantly reduced annualised relapse rates (ARR) (0.26 vs. 0.10, P<0.0001) and were significantly more likely to be relapse free (58.0 percent vs. 79.6 percent, P<0.0001) at the end of the extension phase. ARR were maintained for patients who received Cladribine Tablets for two years in CLARITY and were then switched to placebo for two years in the extension phase. The second oral presentation reported data from the open-label maintenance period of the phase III ORACLE-MS study. ORACLE-MS showed that, for patients with a first demyelinating event, treatment with Cladribine Tablets significantly reduced the risk of progression to clinically definite MS compared with placebo. For the open-label portion of the study, patients who converted to clinically definite MS during the initial treatment period were switched to Rebif(R) therapy. The new data presented at ECTRIMS show that patients who had received Cladribine Tablets in the initial treatment phase had lower ARR over the maintenance period (median time on Rebif = 56.0 weeks) compared with those who had received placebo in the initial treatment phase [0.14 for Cladribine Tablets 3.5 mg/kg (n=25), 0.24 for Cladribine Tablets 5.25 mg/kg (n=24) and 0.42 for placebo (n=60)]. "Cladribine Tablets has a unique oral dosing schedule, with just two short treatment courses administered orally in years one and two. Together with more than 10,000 patient years of safety data and phase III efficacy data, these findings of lasting reductions in relapse rates support our belief that, if approved, Cladribine Tablets may serve as an important new advance for patients with relapsing-remitting MS," said Luciano Rossetti, Head of Global R&D for the Biopharma business of Merck. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has accepted for review the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) of the investigational product Cladribine Tablets for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. About Cladribine Tablets   Cladribine Tablets is an oral small molecule prodrug that selectively and periodically targets lymphocytes thought to be integral to the pathological process of MS. Cladribine Tablets is currently under clinical investigation and not approved for any use in the United States, Canada and Europe. About Rebif(R)  Rebif(R) (interferon beta-1a) is a disease-modifying drug used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is similar to the interferon beta protein produced by the human body. The efficacy of Rebif(R) in chronic progressive MS has not been established. Interferon ss is thought to help reduce inflammation. The exact mechanism is unknown. Rebif(R), which was approved in Europe in 1998 and in the US in 2002, is registered in more than 90 countries worldwide. Rebif(R) has been proven to delay the progression of disability, reduce the frequency of relapses and reduce MRI lesion activity and area*. Rebif(R) can be administrated with the RebiSmart(R) electronic auto-injection device (not approved in the US), or with the RebiDose(R) single-use disposable pen, or the manual multidose injection pen RebiSlide(TM). Rebif(R) can also be administered with the autoinjector Rebiject II(R) or by manual injection using ready-to-use pre-filled syringes. These injection devices are not approved in all countries. In January 2012, the European commission approved the extension of the indication of Rebif(R) in early multiple sclerosis. The extension of the indication of Rebif(R) has not been submitted in the United States. Rebif(R) should be used with caution in patients with a history of depression, liver disease, thyroid abnormalities and seizures. Most commonly reported side effects are flu-like symptoms, injection site disorders, elevation of liver enzymes and blood cell abnormalities. Patients, especially those with depression, seizure disorders, or liver problems, should discuss treatment with Rebif(R) with their doctors. *The exact correlation between MRI findings and the current or future clinical status of patients, including disability progression, is unknown. Rebif(R) (interferon beta-1a) is approved in the United States for relapsing forms of MS. RebiSmart(R), an electronic device for self-injection of Rebif(R), is also not approved in the United States. Cladribine Tablets is an investigational product and not approved for use in any indication in the United States. About Multiple Sclerosis  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. It is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. While symptoms can vary, the most common symptoms of MS include blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the limbs and problems with strength and coordination. The relapsing forms of MS are the most common. All Merck Press Releases are distributed by e-mail at the same time they become available on the Merck Website.

Rebif® should be used with caution in patients with a history of depression, liver disease, thyroid abnormalities and seizures. Most commonly reported side effects are flu-like symptoms, injection site disorders, elevation of liver enzymes and blood cell abnormalities. Patients, especially those with depression, seizure disorders, or liver problems, should discuss treatment with Rebif® with their doctors. *The exact correlation between MRI findings and the current or future clinical status of patients, including disability progression, is unknown. Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is approved in the United States for relapsing forms of MS. RebiSmart®, an electronic device for self-injection of Rebif®, is also not approved in the United States. Cladribine Tablets is an investigational product and not approved for use in any indication in the United States. About Multiple Sclerosis  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the central nervous system and is the most common, non-traumatic, disabling neurological disease in young adults. It is estimated that approximately 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. While symptoms can vary, the most common symptoms of MS include blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the limbs and problems with strength and coordination.

The findings, from the phase III CLARITY and CLARITY EXTENSION trials and from the open-label maintenance period of the phase III ORACLE-MS study, demonstrated durable efficacy of Cladribine Tablets in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) along with a well-characterized safety profile. CLARITY and CLARITY EXTENSION studies confirmed that 20 days of oral dosing over two years was effective in reducing the frequency of relapses and slowing disability progression for up to four years. "The results presented this week show that the clinical benefits of Cladribine Tablets can be maintained in most patients for an additional two years without the need for redosing," said Dr. Giancarlo Comi, Professor of Neurology, Chairman of the Department of Neurology, and Director of the Institute of Experimental Neurology, at Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Scientific Institute San Raffaele, Milan and a lead investigator in the studies. "Although multiple therapies are available for patients with MS, there is still a large unmet need within this patient community, including for therapies that offer lasting benefits." In one oral presentation, data from the two-year phase III CLARITY trial and its two-year extension study (CLARITY EXTENSION) showed that patients with relapsing MS who received placebo in CLARITY and were switched to Cladribine Tablets in CLARITY EXTENSION had significantly reduced annualised relapse rates (ARR) (0.26 vs. 0.10, P<0.0001) and were significantly more likely to be relapse free (58.0 percent vs. 79.6 percent, P<0.0001) at the end of the extension phase. ARR were maintained for patients who received Cladribine Tablets for two years in CLARITY and were then switched to placebo for two years in the extension phase. The second oral presentation reported data from the open-label maintenance period of the phase III ORACLE-MS study. ORACLE-MS showed that, for patients with a first demyelinating event, treatment with Cladribine Tablets significantly reduced the risk of progression to clinically definite MS compared with placebo. For the open-label portion of the study, patients who converted to clinically definite MS during the initial treatment period were switched to Rebif® therapy. The new data presented at ECTRIMS show that patients who had received Cladribine Tablets in the initial treatment phase had lower ARR over the maintenance period (median time on Rebif = 56.0 weeks) compared with those who had received placebo in the initial treatment phase [0.14 for Cladribine Tablets 3.5 mg/kg (n=25), 0.24 for Cladribine Tablets 5.25 mg/kg (n=24) and 0.42 for placebo (n=60)]. "Cladribine Tablets has a unique oral dosing schedule, with just two short treatment courses administered orally in years one and two. Together with more than 10,000 patient years of safety data and phase III efficacy data, these findings of lasting reductions in relapse rates support our belief that, if approved, Cladribine Tablets may serve as an important new advance for patients with relapsing-remitting MS," said Luciano Rossetti, Head of Global R&D for the Biopharma business of Merck. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has accepted for review the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) of the investigational product Cladribine Tablets for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. About Cladribine Tablets Cladribine Tablets is an oral small molecule prodrug that selectively and periodically targets lymphocytes thought to be integral to the pathological process of MS. Cladribine Tablets is currently under clinical investigation and not approved for any use in the United States, Canada and Europe. About Rebif® Rebif® (interferon beta-1a) is a disease-modifying drug used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is similar to the interferon beta protein produced by the human body. The efficacy of Rebif® in chronic progressive MS has not been established. Interferon ß is thought to help reduce inflammation. The exact mechanism is unknown. Rebif®, which was approved in Europe in 1998 and in the US in 2002, is registered in more than 90 countries worldwide. Rebif® has been proven to delay the progression of disability, reduce the frequency of relapses and reduce MRI lesion activity and area*. Rebif® can be administrated with the RebiSmart® electronic auto-injection device (not approved in the US), or with the RebiDose® single-use disposable pen, or the manual multidose injection pen RebiSlide(TM). Rebif® can also be administered with the autoinjector Rebiject II® or by manual injection using ready-to-use pre-filled syringes. These injection devices are not approved in all countries. In January 2012, the European commission approved the extension of the indication of Rebif® in early multiple sclerosis. The extension of the indication of Rebif® has not been submitted in the United States. Rebif® should be used with caution in patients with a history of depression, liver disease, thyroid abnormalities and seizures. Most commonly reported side effects are flu-like symptoms, injection site disorders, elevation of liver enzymes and blood cell abnormalities. Patients, especially those with depression, seizure disorders, or liver problems, should discuss treatment with Rebif® with their doctors. *The exact correlation between MRI findings and the current or future clinical status of patients, including disability progression, is unknown.

Robinson By the standard of today's mega-mergers, a $4 million investment seems like pretty small change. Especially in the $1 trillion global healthcare industry. You see, Johnson & Johnson Inc. (NYSE: JNJ) recently joined with a private-equity firm to invest that "measly" sum in AnTolRx Inc., an early-stage biotech that uses targeted nanoparticles to treat a range of illnesses, including autoimmune diseases and diabetes. Perhaps because the deal is so small, it went completely unnoticed on Wall Street. And that's fine with us, because at Strategic Tech Investor we crush the market by getting out in front of the Street. More to the point, this seemingly small investment speaks volumes about a key tech investing trend that most so-called "analysts" have largely ignored. I'm talking what I call "Biotech's Quiet Comeback." Fact is, four main catalysts have driven this sector upward by 16% in recent weeks. Today, I'm going to reveal these four major catalysts. And I'll show you the single best way to play this silent but lucrative trend… Don't Tell Anyone About This… Let's put the biotech sector's huge recent gains into some perspective. Since the market hit its post-Brexit bottom on June 27, the bellwether Dow Jones U.S. Biotechnology Index has gained roughly 16%. That's more than double the returns we've seen from the overall market. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index has increased by just 7% during the period. Biotech's rebound comes after the sector sold off for several reasons last year, falling 31% from late July 2015 through February 2016. But since then, I have seen four factors at play that account for the sector's quick turnaround. Take a look… Biotech's Quiet Comeback Catalyst No. 1: Drug Breakthroughs Whether it's the kind of early-stage investment that Johnson & Johnson just made in AnTolRx or late-stage drug pipeline news, the sector is set up to profit from a series of breakthroughs. Take the case of Keytruda from Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK). This drug could turn the tide against cancer by altering how our immune system responds to cancer cells. On Sept. 6, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it will consider approving the drug as a first-line defense against lung cancer. That came just a few months after the agency approved it as a second-line defense. Don't Miss: This is your ticket to bigger and better returns… and it won't cost you a penny. What are you waiting for? Read more…  Plus, Sanofi SA (NYSE ADR: SNY) just announced a new diabetes breakthrough in partnership with small-cap Lexicon Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: LXRX). That news sent shares of Lexicon up 17% – and shares of Sanofi will surely benefit over time as its sales forces peddle this impressive new drug. A steady supply of new compounds is one of the reasons global drug sales have risen for at least 15 straight years, from $390 billion in 2001 to more than $1 trillion today, according to Statista. And with so many baby boomers heading into old age, that figure may reach $2 trillion by the end of the next decade. Biotech's Quiet Comeback Catalyst No. 2: M&A Join the conversation.

Werner Antweiler, associate professor in the UBC Sauder School of Business and international trade policy chair, shares his thoughts on the megamerger that has the potential to reshape the world’s food supply. Will Bayer succeed or can this deal still falter? Corporate mergers are not for the faint of heart. A takeover requires chutzpah and single-mindedness—the willingness to disrupt chains of commands in the acquired business, split units, move units, eject underperforming units, and unify the corporate culture. That is why hostile takeovers tend to perform better: the acquiring firm bites down hard on a nut, chews, swallows, and digests. Friendly takeovers run the risk of drifting into conglomerative indifference. What is missing in the Bayer-Monsanto deal is the compelling vision of a clear goal that can only be achieved jointly. If Bayer CEO Werner Baumann wants to succeed, he needs to execute his strategy with aplomb and deliver a compelling vision of how the merged entity will transform the future of farming around the globe. To his advantage, Baumann knows Bayer better than some of his CEO predecessors. As a company insider for nearly 20 years with plenty of international experience, he understands the strengths and weaknesses of Bayer like few others. At the helm only since May, this father of four children just got himself a new kid—an unruly but gifted teenager with a reputation of being a bully. Good parenting will be required. Why did Bayer target Monsanto? Bayer has been on a course of re-organization for more than a decade. In 2005, it spun off its basic chemical division into a new company, Lanxess. That allowed Bayer to focus more on its core business of health care, nutrition, and materials. Last year, Bayer further consolidated its operations by spinning off its materials science division into Covestro. While divesting some units, it strengthened others. In 2014, Bayer bought Merck’s consumer health business in the U.S. Acquiring Monsanto continues Bayer’s repositioning. What made Monsanto particularly appealing to Bayer is its deep and complementary research and development capability and patent pipeline in crop science. Combining crop traits (Monsanto’s strength) with crop protection (Bayer’s strength) makes a lot of business sense. Even more enticing to Bayer is Monsanto’s digital farming platform. The next generation of farming will require customizing solutions to local circumstances. Monsanto was seen as “evil” by many activists—will Bayer be “Mr. Nice Guy”? Genetically-modified organisms (GMOs), including crops, are controversial. On one side, GMO crops promise higher productivity to farmers and a more secure food supply for a growing population. On the other hand, unknown long-term consequences of using GMOs have prompted calls by activists to ban them altogether, or at least label them. Monsanto developed a negative image because its marketing tended to be arrogant, and its sales tactics tended to be aggressive. As a result, Monsanto became the target of much protest, ridicule and even hatred. Bayer’s takeover of Monsanto may provide a fresh start if it fixes Monsanto’s deficiencies in corporate culture. Based in GMO-hostile Europe, Bayer has a good track record for engaging stakeholders and critics. Bayer has been around for more than 150 years and knows a few things about corporate social responsibility that Monsanto doesn’t. For the merger to succeed, Bayer CEO Baumann needs to avoid the mistakes that Daimler CEO Jürgen Schrempp made in 2005. In order to make the new Bayer “Mr. Nice Guy” in the market place, Baumann needs to be “Mr. Bad Guy” in the executive suites in St. Louis, Mo., where Monsanto is headquartered. Even though Monsanto will probably disappear as a brand name, this itself will not be enough to restore trust. Will the size of the new Bayer stifle competition? Bayer and Monsanto have quite different corporate profiles by segment and region. While Bayer’s North American revenue only makes up a quarter of its total, Monsanto’s revenue is 82 per cent based in the Americas. Bayer’s core segments are fungicides, herbicides and insecticides, while Monsanto’s are seeds for corn, soybeans, and vegetables. The two companies complement each other, but the combination of their operations will not itself lead to market dominance either regionally or in particular market segments. What is more worrying for competition is that the Bayer-Monsanto deal is part of a recent wave of mergers in the crop science industry that leaves only a handful of companies competing in major market segments. In the U.S., Bayer-Monsanto and Dupont-Dow will control three-quarters of the market for corn seeds. Bayer-Monsanto will control a third of the world’s herbicides market, Adama-Syngenta another quarter and Dupont-Dow another fifth. These three companies will also control two-thirds of the global insecticides markets. Lack of competition is bad news for farmers. Click here for a full-length version of this interview.

Cruising through the channels I came across Larry King, sporting his trademark suspenders, interviewing a guest on a program called Larry King Special Report. I knew Larry had left CNN and was hosting a couple of interview shows on the RT (Russia Today) and Hulu cable channels, but I don’t get these, so what was I watching? It soon became apparent that this was not a legitimate interview show, but rather an “infomercial.” King was shilling for a dietary supplement, Omega XL, going on about how it provides miraculous joint pain relief. His “guest” was Dr. Sharon McQuillan, waxing poetic about how she recommends Omega XL to all her patients to “help protect their hearts, preserve their heart and vascular health.” Larry, who has a history of heart disease, asked McQuillan how Omega XL can reduce the risk of heart attacks. She answered that “30 years of studies have shown the benefits of omega 3s.” That is true, but totally misleading since none of those studies used this product! Some studies have indeed shown that eating foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids may lower the risk of death from heart attack. And trials with supplements containing DHA and EPA, the two major omega-3 fats found in fish, have suggested a benefit for people who have previously suffered a heart attack. For example, in a placebo-controlled trial, patients taking an omega-3 supplement were 6 per cent less likely to suffer a decline in heart function as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) than those taking a placebo. That’s not a very significant difference. And they were taking four grams a day! Omega XL contains 6.3 mg of EPA and 4.9 mg of DHA, roughly 1/400th the dose that showed a minor benefit in the study! In other words, there is no basis to suggest that the EPA and DHA in this supplement can help protect the heart. Contrary to the image projected by the “interview,” Omega XL is not a DHA/EPA supplement. It is an extract of the “green-lipped mussel” found in New Zealand and is a complex mix of many compounds. There is some evidence for an anti-inflammatory effect, and for possible benefit in arthritis and perhaps even in asthma. But McQuillan’s enthusiastic recommendation for protecting the heart is not supported by evidence. As is revealed in the credits after the show, McQuillan, who is a GP specializing in “integrative, regenerative and aesthetic medicine,” was paid for her appearance. Of course Larry King is not the only celebrity who has lent his or her name to promoting a product. In fact, back in 2000 when Larry was still on CNN, he featured Olympic champions Dorothy Hamill and Bruce Jenner as guests. Larry King Live was certainly not an “infomercial,” it was one of the most respected and most watched interview shows on TV. Both guests were there to talk about the painkilling drug Vioxx. “My doctor prescribed Vioxx for me, and it’s as if I’ve been given a new life,” Hamill told King. “It’s just, it’s been amazing. I feel 20 years younger.” Jenner, still Bruce at the time, had won the decathlon at the 1976 Montreal Olympics but subsequently had knee surgeries and shoulder problems that had left pain that resolved with Vioxx. Both athletes were paid by Merck, the drug’s manufacturer, something that was made clear on the program. Neither Jenner nor Hamill could have known at the time that Merck was already investigating an apparent increase in heart attacks among people taking Vioxx. Four years later the drug would be recalled for that very reason, precipitating some 35,000 lawsuits and payments of over $4 billion by Merck to the plaintiffs. Were there people who were prompted by Hamill and Jenner’s appearance to ask their doctors to prescribe Vioxx? Presumably. Did some suffer adverse consequences? Who knows? But a supposedly objective interview show is no place for paid celebrity product endorsers. There is also the thorny question of television ads for prescription drugs featuring celebrities. Legendary golfer Arnold Palmer and basketball star Chris Bosh have had health problems that required treatment with an anticoagulant and in a TV ad they sing the praises of Xarelto (rivaroxaban), an effective oral “blood thinner.” Although this is a prescription drug, and the side effects and risks are outlined, the ad still indirectly suggests taking medical advice from a celebrity who has no relevant expertise. Kim Kardashian West, who is famous for being famous, promotes Diclegis, a morning sickness relief pill for pregnant women. While the drug is effective, Kim’s lighthearted tome on Instagram, “OMG have you heard about this?” prompted the FDA to censure her for not including risk information or limitations for the use of the drug, something she subsequently corrected. Was there any damage done? Who knows? Wayne Gretzky is the most prolific scorer in hockey history and as classy an athlete as they come. Did he really need to get involved with Myo-T12, a body building supplement that claims to inhibit the action of myostatin, a protein that signals muscles to stop growing? While there is some interesting science behind this fertilized egg yolk powder, there are no studies demonstrating that it can safely and effectively build muscle. However, the Great One’s one-year deal with the manufacturer did bulk up his bank account by $150,000, a sum I suspect he does not need. He is rich enough. Talking about rich, recall the lyrics from If I were a Rich Man from Fiddler on the Roof: “And it won’t make one bit of difference if I answer right or wrong, when you’re rich they think you really know.” That seems to embody the philosophy of advertisers who hire celebrities. But no matter how rich you are, you can’t buy knowledge. joe.schwarcz@mcgill.ca Joe Schwarcz is director of McGill University’s Office for Science & Society (mcgill.ca/oss).

Now, the hard work begins to make the combination a success. Bayer-Monsanto follows agrichemical deals between Dow Chemical and DuPont, as well as ChemChina-Syngenta. Completion of the merger would leave three companies with more than 75 percent of the global market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg -- a level of concentration sure to set off alarm bells with regulators. The combination also faces a public backlash in Germany over concerns about Monsanto's genetically modified seeds and weedkiller -- both abhorred in Bayer's home country. VIDEOS TOP JOBS In a sign of how protracted the regulatory review of the new seed and crop-chemical giant will be, the companies said they will seek approval in 30 jurisdictions around the world -- including the U.S., European Union, Canada and Brazil -- and don't expect to complete the deal until the end of 2017. Monsanto shares closed 20 percent below the offer price on Wednesday over concerns from investors that the deal might not succeed. German companies have a checkered history with mega acquisitions abroad, including Daimler's ill-fated purchase of Chrysler in 1998 for $43 billion -- a stand-out symbol for failed ventures overseas. Another reminder of the difficulties such deals face came just this week when Linde's talks to merge with U.S. rival Praxair fell apart over squabbling about the role of the German company's Munich home base following a combination. Still, mid-tier companies in the country have been forging ahead with foreign acquisitions that garner less attention. ZF Friedrichshafen has done so well with the $12.9 billion purchase of U.S. parts supplier TRW Automotive Holdings last year that it's already on the hunt for new targets. ZF is currently bidding to buy Sweden's Haldex. And Bayer has proven itself as one of the most aggressive acquirers among German companies. In addition to the gutsy Monsanto bid, it won fierce bidding wars to buy rival Schering AG, creating the country's largest drugmaker in 2006, and Merck & Co.'s consumer unit in 2014. Here are five other deals that Bayer and Monsanto might want to study as they move forward. - Deutsche Telekom-VoiceStream Wireless Corp. (2000 - $50.5 billion): This deal at the dawn of the new millennium gave the German telephone company a splashy entry into the U.S. wireless market. But it also came with headaches, as mobile phone improvements were taking off and competition between carriers was fierce. Deutsche Telekom has only recently begun to turn around what became T-Mobile USA Inc. after a sale to Sprint Corp. was blocked by regulators. - Daimler-Chrysler Corp. (1998 - $43 billion): Considered one of the most disastrous deals in corporate history, there was a huge culture clash between the German manufacturer of the luxury Mercedes Benz brand and the U.S. maker of mass market cars like the Chrysler Sebring that led to this merger's downfall. After nine years spent trying to make things work, the automakers' marriage broke down: Daimler sold Chrysler to Cerberus Capital Management in 2007 for just $7.4 billion. - HeidelbergCement-Hanson Ltd. (2007 - $18 billion): This deal was the largest in the building materials industry that year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One looming problem that might not have been on HeidelbergCement's radar when it bought its U.K. competitor: the housing market was about to crash under the weight of subprime mortgages, leading to a slump in construction projects and stripping the company of its investment-grade credit rating. HeidelbergCement didn't return to major deal-making until 2015, when it agreed to buy Italcementi for 3.7 billion euros ($4.2 billion.) - Merck KGaA-Sigma-AldrichCorp. ($16 billion): A happier story: Family-controlled Merck continued a tradition of acquisitions with the purchase of the U.S. firm to expand in chemicals used in research labs and pharmaceutical manufacturing, as well as reducing its dependence on drug development. The German company last month reported second-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates, buoyed by the acquisition of the pharmaceutical equipment maker. Before that it successfully acquired and integrated Millipore Corp., a supplier of drug development equipment for biotechnology companies in 2010, and AZ Electronic Materials SA in 2013 to strengthen its specialty chemicals to the electronics industry. » Next page...

Email Print Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Tweet Home â News Pain care lobby gave $3.5M in Ohio as opioid deaths climbed Metro Creative Connection By Julie Carr Smyth, The Associated Press Posted: 09/16/16, 5:16 PM EDT | Updated: on 09/16/2016 # Comments COLUMBUS >> As Ohio’s overdose epidemic has climbed toward a record high, an army of lobbyists representing makers of prescription painkillers and their allies poured more than $3.5 million into Ohio political coffers. Pharmaceutical companies and allied groups belonging to the Pain Care Forum lobbying collective gave nearly $2.5 million to federal candidates from Ohio from 2006 through 2015, according to data analyzed by The Associated Press and the Center for Public Integrity. State-level giving of more than $1 million was directed at candidates of both parties, including governors, attorneys general, Ohio Supreme Court justices and legislative leaders, and committee chairs in power positions over Ohio health law. Republican Party committees received about $137,000, while Democratic ones got $41,000. The investigation by AP and CPI found that the Pain Care Forum worked in Washington over the past decade to quietly derail efforts to curb U.S. consumption of pain-killing drugs, such as OxyContin, by promoting the vital role of prescription painkillers in Americans’ lives. That went hand in hand with a 50-state strategy. Advertisement Participating drug companies, associations and alliances also have other business before Ohio’s Legislature, but a steady flow of contributions from companies employing an average of 37 Ohio lobbyists at the Statehouse has meant their interests remain well represented when pain care issues arise. A huge chunk of the campaign cash identified through the analysis went to then-House Speaker John Boehner, of southwest Ohio, who received about $875,000 over the decade, according to the data. Among state candidates, Republican Gov. John Kasich topped the list, with about $46,000. Top state givers among forum members were Pfizer, Abbott Labs, Merck and Johnson & Johnson. Kasich has championed a host of remedies to Ohio’s opioid problem, beginning with creation of the Governor’s Cabinet Opiate Action Team within days of his 2011 inauguration. He has worked with state leaders since then to extend access to treatments and increase availability of the overdose drug naloxone and launched an education campaign for schoolchildren called Start Talking. A glimmer of good news: Painkiller prescriptions in Ohio have fallen from 11,261,528 in 2013 to 9,955,858 last year, according to the data. Despite all that, accidental drug deaths continued to skyrocket. Ohio overdose deaths have gone up annually over the past decade, from 1,515 in 2006 to 2,744 in 2015, according to the analysis. That 81 percent increase is the seventh highest among U.S. states over the period, the analysis found. When a new record was announced last month, Kasich said it made him “feel terrible.” He stressed that the state is making progress. After Kasich, the second highest recipient of Pain Care Forum contributions was state Sen. Dave Burke, a Marysville Republican and pharmacist. Burke received about $32,000 from forum participants from 2006 to 2015, according to the data, which represent a minimum figure for contributions. Burke chairs the Senate Medicaid committee, services on the budget-writing Finance committee and helped champion Ohio’s recently enacted medical marijuana law. Dozens of state lawmakers — including every House Speaker and Senate President and chairs of relevant committees — also received donations. Subscribe to Home Delivery and SAVE!

(ACRX) was up more than 9% on Thursday, following positive results for ARX-04 in the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain in post-operative study patients, including elderly patients and those with organ impairment, in its third phase III registration trial, dubbed SAP303. The primary objective of the SAP303 trial was to study the safety of ARX-04 in the post-operative management of moderate-to-severe acute pain. According to the trial results, majority of patients - including the majority of higher-risk patients - did not experience any adverse events. The company reported positive results from a phase III study, known as SAP301, which evaluated ARX-04 for the short-term treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe acute pain following ambulatory abdominal surgery in September 2015. Positive results were reported from a phase III trial, dubbed SAP302, which assessed ARX-04 in patients who presented to the emergency room with moderate-to-severe acute pain associated with trauma or injury last month. Now that the results of all phase III studies are out, the company intends to submit a new drug application for ARX-04 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain in medically supervised settings with the FDA by the end of 2016. ACRX closed Thursday's trading at $3.60, up 9.76%. Shares of Aerie Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AERI) touched an all-time high of $34.69 on Thursday, following positive phase III results of its second glaucoma drug candidate Roclatan. Roclatan is a fixed dose combination of Aerie's most advanced drug candidate Rhopressa and Latanoprost, a widely prescribed prostaglandin analog for glaucoma. In the first phase III trial of Roclatan, known as Mercury 1, Roclatan demonstrated statistical superiority over Rhopressa and Latanoprost. Another phase III trial of Roclatan, named Mercury 2, is underway, and topline data readout from this trial is expected in the second quarter of 2017. The company filed its NDA for Rhopressa last week. AERI touched an all-time high of $34.69 on Thursday, before closing the day's trading at $30.61, up 44.87%. Amgen's (AMGN) global phase II trial of Erenumab has demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in monthly migraine days compared with placebo in patients with chronic migraine. The study included 667 patients who were randomized to receive either subcutaneous placebo or subcutaneous Erenumab 70 mg once or 140 mg once a month. At week 12, there was a reduction of 50 percent or more in number of monthly migraine days in 40 percent and 41 percent (70 mg and 140 mg doses, respectively) of individuals in the Erenumab groups compared to just 24 percent of those receiving placebo. Results from phase III studies investigating Erenumab in episodic migraine are expected later this year. Erenumab is being co-developed by Amgen and Novartis (NVS). Amgen retains commercialization rights to Erenumab in the U.S., Canada and Japan while Novartis holds rights in Europe and rest of world. AMGN closed Thursday's trading at $172.64, up 1.47%. The FDA has approved Aralez Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s (ARLZ) once-daily YOSPRALA for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients at risk for aspirin-induced gastric ulcers. YOSPRALA is the only prescription fixed-dose combination of aspirin, an anti-platelet agent, and omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) in the U.S. Daily aspirin is a standard of care for secondary cardiovascular event prevention, but gastrointestinal symptoms are often cited as the reason patients stop taking this important therapy. YOSPRALA is designed to support both cardio- and gastro-protection for at-risk patients. ARLZ closed Thursday's trading 5.13% higher at $5.74. BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.'s (BMRN) Marketing Authorization Application for Brineura to treat children with CLN2 disease, a form of Batten disease, has been accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency. Accordingly, the review process has been started, with the opinion of EMA's Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP), and a decision from the European Commission anticipated by the third quarter of 2017. In the U.S., the NDA for Brineura is under FDA review, and a decision is expected on April 27, 2017. BMRN closed Thursday's trading at $95.38, up 0.08%. Cara Therapeutics Inc. (CARA) has initiated a phase 2b trial of an oral tablet formulation of CR845 for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis. The study is designed to evaluate three tablet strengths of CR845, 1.0 mg, 2.5 mg and 5.0 mg, dosed twice a day over an eight-week treatment period in approximately 330 osteoarthritis patients experiencing moderate-to-severe pain. The company expects to report top-line data from this trial during the first half of 2017. CARA closed Thursday's trading at $6.23, up 2.30%. Merck, (MRK) in partnership with Pfizer Inc. (PFE), on Thursday announced that a phase III study of Ertugliflozin, an investigational oral drug for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes, met its primary endpoint. In the study, dubbed VERTIS SITA2, 5 mg and 15 mg daily doses of Ertugliflozin showed significantly greater reductions in A1C* of 0.69 percent and 0.76 percent, respectively, compared with placebo, when added to patients on a background of JANUVIA (100 mg/day) and stable Metformin (?1500 mg/day). *A1C is an average measure of blood glucose over the past two to three months. MRK closed Thursday's trading at $62.38, up 1.68%. Shares of Novavax Inc. (NVAX) plunged more than 83% in extended trading on Thursday, following the failure of its phase III trial of respiratory syncytial virus fusion (F) protein nanoparticle vaccine candidate. In the trial, dubbed Resolve, the company's respiratory syncytial virus fusion (F) protein nanoparticle vaccine candidate ((RSV F Vaccine) did not demonstrate efficacy in the prevention of moderate-severe RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (RSV msLRTD), as defined by the presence of multiple lower respiratory tract symptoms. The secondary objective of demonstrating efficacy of the RSV F Vaccine in reducing the incidence of all symptomatic respiratory disease due to RSV (RSV ARD) was also not achieved. NVAX closed Thursday's trading at $8.34, up 0.36%. In after hours, the stock was down 83.21% to $1.40. Otonomy Inc. (OTIC) has successfully completed an open-label phase 3b clinical trial of OTIPRIO in 501 pediatric patients with a history of otitis media requiring tympanostomy tube placement surgery. Otiprio was approved by the FDA last December for the treatment of pediatric patients with bilateral otitis media with effusion undergoing tympanostomy tube placement, and was commercially launched in March of this year. The drug has generated sales of $89 thousand year-to-date. The phase 3b trial of OTIPRIO involved a broader pediatric patient population than the previous phase III trials by including patients undergoing common concurrent surgeries and patients without bilateral effusion on the day of surgery. OTIC closed Thursday's trading at $18.00, up 1.24%. TapImmune Inc. (TPIV.OB) is all set to implement a 1-for-12 reverse stock split of its common stock in preparation for its proposed uplisting to the NASDAQ Capital Market. The reverse stock split will become effective on September 16, 2016. TPIV.OB closed Thursday's trading at $0.43, down 1.15%.

Mylan's CEO is scheduled to appear before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to answer questions about price hikes associated with the EpiPen, its allergy shot. The company raised the price from $57 in 2007 to $600 for a two-pack in 2016. The panel is also expected to question a FDA official about the delay in approving a competing generic.  (Bloomberg) 2. Average employee health insurance premiums rose 3% in 2016, and the average deductible for these plans increased by 12%, a survey found. It also found that the Affordable Care Act did not drive up employer health insurance costs and instead employers switched employees from part-time to full-time work to make them eligible for health insurance.

(Modern Healthcare) 5. A FDA advisory committee recommended that Pfizer would no longer be required to place a black-box warning on Chantix, its smoking-cessation drug. The warning was added to the label in 2008.

Lean away from this obsessive focus on the professional class, Hillary. 09/15/2016 09:44 pm ET | Updated Sep 16, 2016 220 Jason Linkins Eat The Press Editor, The Huffington Post ASSOCIATED PRESS Sheryl Sandberg is one of the billionaires in the Clinton family orbit.  In case you missed the hot, speculative news about the 2016 presidential race, The Huffington Post’s Ben Walsh and Ryan Grim reported that sources close to GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump are saying that he’d be inclined to appoint “eccentric” tech billionaire (and Trump endorser) Peter Thiel to the Supreme Court, where he’ll have a greater opportunity to ensure that America’s plutocrats are no longer bothered by nosy journalists or would-be trust-busters. But Hillary Clinton, she is not to be outdone! See, the former secretary of state knows tech billionaires, too (and not just disgraced ones), so if you want to get into a famous-friend-turned-potential-appointee fight, Clinton is ready to bring it. Here’s the skinny from Politico’s Morning Money newsletter: TREASURY WATCH: SANDBERG RISING — Early speculation held that Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg probably wouldn’t leave California to return to DC to serve as Treasury Secretary in a Clinton administration. That’s changed lately as MM hears more and more that she could return to be the first woman to lead Treasury. The left may not love her roots in the Bob Rubin wing of the Democratic Party but her star power and historic potential would probably blow away any opposition. Naturally, this is all mere scuttlebutt, though it is plausible scuttlebutt for a host of reasons. As noted above, Sandberg has “roots” in the Democratic Party, and yes, it’s from the part of the Democratic Party that everyone’s rightly skeptical about. Prior to her Facebook career, Sandberg was enmeshed with the folks who appeared on the Time magazine cover that has aged the poorest. Specifically, she served as chief of staff to Larry Summers during his tenure as secretary of the treasury, where he served under Bill Clinton.  But it’s not merely her place in the Clinton family orbit that makes this rumor feel just right. Sandberg is almost the perfect embodiment of Clinton’s larger economic policy portfolio ― indeed, the economic policy portfolio of the Democrats writ large ― which was ably summed up by author Thomas Frank in a March interview with HuffPost: “At some point, [the Democrats] decided that they weren’t all that interested in the concerns of working people anymore.” Rather, Frank says, they became fixated on “the concerns of the professional class, people with advanced degrees, people at the very top of our economic society.” On the stump, Clinton talks about the need to further diversify this professional class. Hey, let’s solve income inequality by ensuring that the corporate board of every military contractor in Washington’s suburban belt looks more like the United Colors of Benetton, guys! Installing Sandberg at the Treasury, and releasing all the “historic potential” that comes from being the first woman to head the agency, would be in keeping with that theme. That’s “Part One” of the plan, anyway. (”Part Three” is “everybody wins” and Part Two is a series of tastefully aligned question marks.) Sandberg, of course, is best known for being the author of Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, her insanely popular manifesto of next-wave feminist aspiration, which encourages women in the workforce (the “knowledge sector” workforce, anyway) to embolden themselves on the job and deconstruct all of the psychological barriers that these women have supposedly erected around themselves in order to surmount the more structural, sexist barriers erected by others (white men). The book, naturally, spawned the Lean In Foundation, which bills itself as “a nonprofit organization and online community dedicated to helping all women achieve their ambitions.” But while there is no shortage of positive testimonials available at the foundation’s website ― including one from Reese Witherspoon, who’s well-known to have only won a single Academy Award (and a Golden Globe and a BAFTA and a Screen Actors Guild Award) before Lean In came along ― it’s hard to actually quantify how well the Lean In brand is helping individual women in the workforce. However, it is easy to discern how well Lean In is serving its corporate sponsors. And it’s not exactly taking a courageous role in smashing the patriarchy. In a 2013 issue of The Baffler, journalist and author Susan Faludi undertook a deep examination of Lean In’s corporate partners in order to settle an argument: “Sandberg’s admirers would say that Lean In is using free-market beliefs to advance the cause of women’s equality. Her detractors would say (and have) that her organization is using the desire for women’s equality to advance the cause of the free market.”  Those detractors have a point!  As Faludi skillfully enumerates, Lean In’s corporate partners are legion and include big names, such as: “Chevron, General Electric, Procter & Gamble, Comcast, Bank of America and Citibank, Coca-Cola and Pepsico, AT&T and Verizon, Ford and GM, Pfizer and Merck & Co., Costco and Walmart, and, of course, Google and Facebook.” As Faludi notes: Never before have so many corporations joined a revolution. Virtually nothing is required of them — not even a financial contribution. “There are no costs associated with partnering with Lean In,” the organization’s manual assures. “We just ask that you publicly support our mission and actively promote our Community to your employees.” All the companies have to do is post their logo on Lean In’s “Platform Partners” page, along with a quote from one of their executives professing the company’s commitment to advancing women. But as Faludi goes on to report, many of these corporations’ commitments to “advancing women” look very suspect when you start to examine their sundry legal altercations. Here’s just a taste from Faludi’s files: Citibank: “In 2010, six current and former female employees sued Citibank’s parent company, Citigroup, for discriminating against women at all levels, paying them less, overlooking them for promotions, and firing them first in companywide layoffs.” Booz Allen Hamilton: “In 2011, Molly Finn, a former partner at the firm who had been fired after serving as its highest-ranking female employee and a star performer, sued for sex discrimination. She charged the company with creating an unwelcome environment for women and intentionally barring them from top leadership posts. During a review for a promotion (which she was subsequently denied), she was told to stop saying ‘pro-woman, feminist things,’ she recalled.” Wells Fargo: The bank reached a class-action settlement in a suit that “charged that the bank’s brokerage business, Wells Fargo Advisors (originally Wachovia Securities), discriminated against women in compensation and signing bonuses, denied them promotions, and cheated them out of account distributions, investment partnerships, and mentoring and marketing opportunities.” Walmart: “In 2011, the world’s largest retailer famously managed to dodge one of the largest class-action sex-discrimination suits in U.S. history (involving 1.5 million women), after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on technical grounds that the case didn’t constitute a single class action.” Faludi went on to seek comment from Sandberg about how Lean In squares its willingness to provide positive press to these corporations with the fact that, in many instances, they do not exactly deserve it ― as well as whether her current employer, Facebook, was taking to the Lean In revolution with any degree of zeal. For her troubles, Faludi was sent on a comical runaround that ended with some PR drone answering her questions by rejecting their premises.  Suffice it to say that whatever benefits the Lean In revolution have provided for individual women in the workforce, it’s been a far greater boon to these corporate partners. For the low, low price of lip service to Lean In’s compilation of empowerment aphorisms, they might obtain the foundation’s imprimatur ― behind which they can hide a bevy of sins that a more rigorous band of feminists might confront more critically. It’s the sort of brand-washing opportunity you can’t find many places. Though one place you can find it? The Clinton Foundation! There’s little doubt that Clinton could benefit from Sandberg’s “star power” and her optimism. But this hot rumor is a trial balloon that floats many thousands of miles above the reality of our economy. It’s yet another pitch from the Clinton camp that’s aimed at an affluent and over-served segment of the population, squarely missing those who truly regard their future fortunes with a mix of anxiety and resignation. Trump, on the other hand, doesn’t cater to the professional class at all. His pitch is squarely aimed at all the people Clinton talks over, above and around. He’s a class traitor, leading a band of white nationalists under a banner that promises to claw back the spoils of the country’s elites, and redistribute them to everyone who feels like they’ve lost out in the past half-century of progress. Floating Sandberg as a possible Cabinet appointee comes at a curious time in the presidential race. As Clinton’s lead in the polls erodes, there seems to be a growing awareness that her campaign needs to retool its message to voters. What Sandberg’s name signals is that the next phase of the Clinton team’s public communications will be more optimistic and audacious. That’s not an entirely half-baked approach. This is a message that would draw contrast with Trump’s downcast view of the world and the gutter stylings he deploys to convey it. The only hitch is that it’s hard to know for whom this message is intended. Surely not for the people in Ohio whose affections Clinton now desperately needs to win back. Right now, the race in that state ― and elsewhere ― seems to be trending in the other direction.  Will further Lean In-esque paeans to the aspirations of well-heeled professionals draw these voters back to Clinton’s fold? I’m starting to wonder if the tightening race isn’t so much based on the recent media coverage of Clinton’s pneumonia as it is a product of the fact that her larger economic pitch has always tended to exclude the very people most in need of reassurances and a vision for the future. Trump may be a dangerous strongman, but he takes that strongman act right to that portion of the electorate who likely greet Clinton’s message ― and her obsession with the already affluent ― as tone-deaf. There’s no doubt that Sandberg has proven that you can gather up a bunch of management bromides, package them as a prosperity gospel to the professional class and create a viral sensation. Clinton has, for a long while, spliced this sort of DNA into her economic pitch ― and it probably sounds great to both her donors and her base. But it’s an open question as to whether this reaches the voters she needs to persuade.  In the end, I’m just not sure you can actually beat authoritarianism with a wall of Successories posters. But it’s starting to look like we’re going to find out.

IAM Magazine Login Reset password Toggle navigation Home Home Magazine Blog Market intelligence Top patent professionals Top IP strategists International reports Events Media IPBC UN panel recommends stricter patentability rules and compulsory licensing to improve access to medicine 16 Sep 16 < Back to Blogs Jack Ellis A United Nations taskforce released its much-anticipated report on patient access to medicines this week. In the run-up to the report’s publication, many IP owners expected that the role of patents in the drug industry would very much be in the firing line – and the taskforce’s newly published recommendations for improving healthcare access are likely to make difficult reading for plenty of rights holders. To provide some background, the UN Secretary-General’s High Level Panel on Access to Medicines (HLP) was assembled and set to work in November 2015, with the objective of reviewing and assessing “proposals and recommend solutions for remedying the policy incoherence between the justifiable rights of inventors, international human rights law, trade rules and public health in the context of health technologies”. Of course, there are myriad other factors that have relevance here – and the report itself acknowledges that, while they are not within its mandate, there “are many reasons why people do not get the healthcare they need, including, inter alia, under-resourced health systems, a lack of sufficiently qualified and skilled healthcare workers, inequalities between and within countries, regulatory barriers, poor health education, unavailability of health insurance, exclusion, stigma, discrimination and exclusive marketing rights”. This report is focused squarely on the interplay between IP rights, market regulation and healthcare. The argument behind all of this is that pharmaceutical patents allow their owners to raise the prices of medicines, and maintain those high prices for the duration of the patent term, therefore putting the medicines in question beyond the reach of many patients and healthcare systems – and particularly those in the developing world. In response, some countries have denied patent protection for certain drugs, or have issued – or threatened to issue – compulsory licences that effectively override rights holders’ patents and allow generic manufacturers to produce cheaper versions of the drugs they cover. On the other side of the fence, pharmaceutical innovators claim that the right to exclude awarded to them by patent ownership gives them an opportunity to recoup at least some of the massive R&D investment they have made in discovering, manufacturing and marketing new drugs. When their patents are revoked or are subject to compulsory licences – or when they are prevented from obtaining patent protection in the first place – their incentives for continued, sustained investment in R&D activities are removed, which leaves a big question mark hanging over the development of new drugs further down the line. In short, both camps claim that they have the best answer to the issue of improving global health outcomes. The HLP report aims to come up with some conclusions to this long-running debate. Some of its key recommendations are as follows: World Trade Organisation (WTO) member states should “make full use of the policy space available in Article 27 of the TRIPS [Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights] Agreement by adopting and applying rigorous definitions of invention and patentability… to ensure that patents are only awarded when genuine innovation has occurred”. This is intended to address the activity of ‘evergreening’ – whereby pharmaceutical companies allegedly seek patents on minor adjustments to a core product, that do not improve its efficacy, in order to prolong their right to exclude. Rights holders will be concerned that governments will take this as carte blanche to deny patent protection on certain inventions, however. Following on from the above, “governments and the private sector must refrain from explicit or implicit threats, tactics or strategies that undermine the right of WTO members to use TRIPS flexibilities”. This would appear to be in reference to bilateral free trade agreements, as well as wider proposed pacts such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, led by developed nations such as the United States and Japan, that require partners to implement legal and regulatory reforms that strengthen the exclusive rights awarded to patent owners. Governments should adopt and implement legislation that “facilitates the issuance of compulsory licenses”. The HLP report stresses that such legislation “must be designed to effectuate quick, fair, predictable and implementable compulsory licenses for legitimate public health needs, and particularly with regards to essential medicines”. Clearly, this is not something that many pharmaceutical patent owners will welcome. They will fear that this will encourage governments to issue compulsory licences even in situations where there is not a compelling and urgent case to be made for them. Private sector companies should “report, as part of their annual reporting cycle, on actions they have taken that promote access to health technologies” and governments should require them to disclose “the costs of R&D, production, marketing and distribution of health technology” along with any public funding they may have received in the course of drug development. Universities and research institutions in receipt of public funding “must prioritise public health objectives over financial returns in their patenting and licensing practices”. Stakeholders should “test and implement new and additional models for financing and rewarding public health research and development”. The current system where R&D budgets are generally tied to product-related revenues – and where the exclusivity awarded by patent protection plays a vital role – should be supplemented and replaced by one that ‘de-links’ the costs of innovation from end prices of drugs. This could take the form of up-front grants, tax breaks and cash prizes for reaching certain development milestones. To this end, the UN should initiate a process for governments to negotiate a binding ‘R&D Convention’ and a ‘Code of Principles for Biomedical R&D’ that would set out the public health aims of innovation and govern R&D financing. There’s plenty of food for thought in there, not least the much greater role of government, and of the UN itself, in the future of drug development that is envisaged. How any of that would work in reality remains to be seen (if it is ever seen at all). What can be said for sure at this stage is that many of those working in IP management in the life sciences industries will feel hard done by, notwithstanding efforts by the likes of Gilead, Merck and Novartis to try out market-based solutions to the access problem - and the fact that around 95% of the treatments on the World Health Organisation's current Essential Medicines list are off-patent anyway. Despite nods to “the justified rights of inventors”, the HLP’s recommendations do generally seem to support the views of those who would like to see a weakening of IP rights in the pharmaceutical space. On November 3 in Munich, IAM hosts its first-ever Pharma and Biotech Summit. No doubt this report and its implications will be one of the major topics of conversation throughout the day.   Sectors IP management Licensing IP politics IP litigation Patents IP business Leave a comment Please log in or register to leave a comment.
