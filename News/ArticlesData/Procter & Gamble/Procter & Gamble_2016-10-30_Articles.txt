Jamal Carnette (TMFJCar) Oct 31, 2016 at 11:59AM Looking for cold hard cash? These five companies are paying big dividends. Image source: Getty Images. It's a poorly kept secret that dividends are a large driver of stock market returns. Over the past 25 years, the S&P 500 index has provided investors with a nearly 450% return. However, if investors would have reinvested dividends, their pre-tax return would be approximately 80% higher at 810%. With that in mind, we asked a few Motley Fool contributors their favorite dividend stocks to buy in November. This dividend is as solid as steel Neha Chamaria: One dividend stock that's caught my attention this month is Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE). The steelmaker's recently released third-quarter numbers didn't go down well with the market, as the company missed analyst estimates, but Nucor delivered a solid quarter in reality, with its net income for the first nine months of the year climbing 30% year over year. With that kind of growth in profits, shareholders can safely expect Nucor to dole out higher dividends going forward. In fact, Nucor isn't any other dividend stock. It's a dividend aristocrat that has increased its dividend for 43 straight years and has paid out a dividend for 174 consecutive quarters now. No other company in its industry boasts such an incredible dividend record. Moreover, Nucor wouldn't be maintaining such a streak given the cyclicality of steel business if it weren't financially strong and stable. In fact, Nucor's balance sheet is among the strongest in the industry, with limited debt and ample liquid cash. What's more, the steelmaker generated twice as much free cash flow as net income during the trailing 12 months, which is incredible, as a company pays dividends out of its FCF. So there's every chance Nucor will be able to maintain its streak of dividend increases in the coming years. With Nucor offering a juicy dividend yield of 3.2%, income investors should consider the stock's 13% drop in the past three months an opportunity not to be missed. Microsoft is executing on all levels Evan Niu, CFA: This might sound a little odd given my obvious bias here, but I'm going to go with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The software giant has been firing on all cylinders lately, and much of that is largely thanks to CEO Satya Nadella. For years, investors lacked optimism around the company's future direction, but Nadella genuinely has them excited again, as he has a much clearer strategic vision than his predecessor, Steve Ballmer. We're now seeing Microsoft innovate in hardware in a way that we've quite literally never seen before. At the same time, the core enterprise business is as strong as ever, with Office continuing to crush it on both the consumer and commercial fronts. Microsoft's new Surface Studio shows the company is fully committed to hardware success. Image source: Microsoft. As far as the numbers go, Microsoft's yield is fairly modest at this point. Shares yield approximately 2.5% at current prices, but this yield is being pushed down, since Microsoft is at all-time highs. Shares are now even higher than they were during the 2000 tech bubble. But the big difference between then and now is that the valuation is much more compelling, and cash flow far more sustainable. Sure, there are higher yields out there, even within tech, but I think Microsoft currently presents a compelling combination of reliable income combined with reasonable potential for capital appreciation as long as the company continues to execute under Nadella's leadership. Procter & Gamble may be a boring stock, but it has provided investors exciting returns Jamal Carnette, CFA: The dividend trade has become quite crowded because of historically low interest rates on bonds and other interest-bearing investments. The key is to find a well-run company committed to paying and raising their dividend, and not simply companies that have raised their dividends to take advantage of current investor sentiment. One dividend aristocrat with an amazing dividend history is Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). The consumer-goods company has paid dividends for 126 consecutive years and has increased its dividend for 60 years straight. In the past 30 years, P&G has kicked its rate of dividend increases into high gear by increasing its per-share payout by 9.8% per year through fiscal 2016, a rate much higher than overall inflation during this timeframe. Currently the company trades at a yield of 3.2%, 70 basis points higher than a current 30-year U.S. Treasury bond. There's a belief among many investors that a "boring" company like P&G will disappoint as valuations are currently stretched among dividend-paying stocks. Additionally, the company's core products (Tide, Pampers, and Charmin) are in the uninspiring fast-moving-consumer-goods space. However, the company has averaged an annual total return of 7.8% over the last 15 years, a full percentage point better than the greater S&P during this period. On a one-year basis, P&G has doubled the index by increasing 12.7%, versus 6%. Still, the company trades at a lower price-to-earnings valuation than the overall S&P index. Shares recently popped on a positive first-quarter report in which the company beat both EPS and revenue estimates while maintaining full-year sales guidance. Procter & Gamble may be considered boring, but its stable of billion-dollar brands should allow the company to continue to pay and raise dividend payments to investors for years to come. Things are looking up for this large-cap drugmaker George Budwell: Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) is arguably one of most compelling Big Pharma to stocks to own right now because of Keytruda's recent approval as a treatment for front-line metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The bottom line is that this single indication has the potential to add around $2.5 billion to Keytruda's annual sales at peak. Moreover, industry experts believe that oncologists will quickly adopt Keytruda as a first-line NSCLC treatment, especially after its main rival, Opdivo, flamed out in late-stage testing for this same indication.   Image source: Merck. That's certainly welcome news for shareholders, especially since Merck's 12-month trailing payout ratio currently stands at a worrisome 100.55%. In other words, Merck's slightly above-average yield for a major drugmaker of approximately 3% should now be safe. Perhaps most importantly, though, Keytruda's breakthrough for this high-value indication should act as a magnet for large institutional investors moving forward, helping to drive its share price higher. Wall Street, after all, places a high premium on franchise-level cancer drugs, and Keytruda is undoubtedly on its way toward becoming a top-selling oncology product in the near future.   Growth and yield? Sign me up Brian Feroldi: It's rare to find a company that offers up a yield of nearly 4.5% that's also poised for long-term growth, but that's exact what Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE:BIP) offers investors today. This company is a publicly traded limited partnership that owns and operates infrastructure assets all around the world. Currently, the company owns electrical transmission lines, ports, toll roads, pipelines, rail lines, and more. What do all of these assets have in common? They are all one of a kind, are irreplaceable, and require huge amounts of capital to build. That means the company doesn't really have to worry about having a competitor set up shop right next door, which helps make its financial statements highly predictable. In fact, over 90% of its revenue either comes from regulated industries or operates under long-term contracts. Brookfield's stability allows its management team to pass along an ever-growing stream of profits back to investors. Since 2009, the company's distribution has grown by 12% annually, and there are plenty of reasons to expect another payout bump next year. While there are potential tax ramifications that need to be considered before buying shares, I think this is a great stock for income-focused investors to consider buying today.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 30, 2016 at 3:31PM Walk down the aisles of your local grocery store or big box retailer, and you are faced with a sometimes overwhelming selection of thousands of products. But even then, that is only a small subset of the more than one million items available to consumers each year. In this Industry Focus: Consumer Goods segment, the cast considers the challenges of competing in an environment with seemingly limitless consumer options and what that implies for consumer staples manufacturers like Unilever and Procter & Gamble. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 12, 2016. Vincent Shen: I really wanted to hammer the point home in terms of how important these efforts can be for companies by stepping back a little bit and giving a little bit of a big picture context and calling out some numbers that I think can put things into perspective. For example, in 2008 research from the Food Marketing Institute the typical U.S. grocery store, or supermarket, stocked about 47,000 different products. That is up 50% from the previous decade and about five-fold since 1975. Keep in mind that a Wal-Mart Supercenter, for example, their SKU numbers for a store that size is well over 100,000. And then if you go a step further, researching the case at any one time in the United States, there are at least one million products on the market for consumers to purchase. So that research might be a few years old now, so with some of the other trends that we've seen, you can imagine that number is likely much larger than one million at this point with customization, for example. So the sobering reality I think for a lot of retailers, be it Unilever or Procter & Gamble, is that consumers only use about 340 unique items in a year out of that one million-plus. And making sure that you are maximizing your profitability, maximizing your product mix and what is on store shelves, to boost your revenue and make sure that that small subset of items that each consumer uses includes products from your portfolio, is just really important. Is there any other thoughts that you wanted to leave our listeners with, Asit? Asit Sharma: Just one last thought. And by the way, those are some mind-boggling statistics and I think that really visually gives us an idea of how much supply there is out there of product and why it's a great idea to reduce as much as you can if you're a manufacturer. My last point is that we see the Pareto Principle in life a lot, which is 80% of outputs are due to 20% of inputs. See that in so many different spheres of life, and manufacturers have found this to be very true ... SKU and brand rationalization, that a lot of times it's just a few products that are really driving your sales and your profits, so why wouldn't you put in the effort to pare those down and optimize your profit and optimize your cash flow? As investors, we should be looking for the companies which are actively trying to perform this exercise. And the two companies we've mentioned today are really into this. Their management talks about these concepts almost every conference call, we see it in the numbers, and it's a great way to evaluate a consumer goods company. Are they paying attention to the proliferation of products that they've got, and are they trying to make themselves more efficient as time goes on?

Consultancy firm R3 has released a guide to the best client-agency relationships after gathering more than 100 submissions from leading global marketers and their agencies. Called Global 40, the study whittled down these submissions to a final 40 relationships that have stood the test of time and proven themselves to be effective and mutually beneficial. Interestingly, R3 noted that the 40 relationships in its study have lasted for an average of 22 years, compared to the industry average of 3.2 years, proving that "managed pro-actively, these commitments can endure". "Great marriages require mutual trust, a common understanding and clear goals," said Greg Paull, Principal of R3. "What separates these partnerships is a sense that both sides are working to improve brand outcomes, separate to personal agendas, politics and infighting," he added. Some of the world's best-known brands are included in the rankings, including Procter & Gamble, the world's largest marketer, which has four relationships in the top 40. R3 said that Procter & Gamble invests as much internal time on training its own team on agency management as it does immersing the agencies, but it also highlighted the successful multiple relationships developed by Unilever, P&G's great rival, as well as Coca-Cola and McDonald's. Some of the other top brands featured in the report include Adidas, Apple, BMW, FedEx, IBM, Mondelez and 24 others. Based on how these brands have maintained effective partnerships with their agencies, the study also drew six important conclusions for global CMOs. "Look to new models" – R3 said all cases in its report had experimented with new ways of working, structures and outcomes. "Face time matters" – despite the rise of technology, R3 said the best partnerships find ways to regularly connect to share best practice. "Focus on outcomes, not inputs" – as with the recent agreement between McDonald's and Omnicom, both sides can align by setting mutually common objectives. "Take digital seriously" – global CMOs need a strategic digital partner rather than one just for tactical execution. "Immersion both ways" – both clients and agencies need to build understanding of each other's work and internal initiatives. Finally, "Benchmark and evaluate" – global CMOS and agencies need to share a "Dashboard of Best Practice" to drive effectiveness and efficiencies.

Even when great ideas come up from the lowest of the hierarchical ladder, it is rarely delivered to the very top. The leadership shouts for innovation, but it often does not realize that innovation is within arm's reach. Letting ideas flow freely within an organization ― the open innovation platform ― is a critical factor in driving creative success for a company. "It's not okay from the CEO's perspective to say to that bright young person you just hired, 'if you have an idea, you have to sell the idea to your boss, your boss' boss and your boss' boss' boss before it has a chance of being implemented,'" said Tom Kelley, partner at IDEO, the world's first and largest design thinking consultancy which started off in Palo Alto, California. "Some people you hire for their deep technical excellence, but they don't always have the communication skills to sell the idea to the hierarchy. As an outsider, I don't want to shake up the hierarchy, I want to go to the CEO and say 'Look, you've earned the right to be the boss, to make the hiring decisions, but don't let the hierarchy get in the way of the free flow of ideas,'" he said during an interview with The Korea Times. Kelley was in Seoul to give a speech at Startup:CON (Oct. 11-12), a conference for startups and innovators, organized by the Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA). "In all such cultures, you've got to find a way to have that idea float, go up and down the hierarchy, through an open innovation platform inside the company -- whether it be poster-days or internal trade fairs ― or some way that systematically floats ideas up and down. You have to have a way," he said. Tom Kelley speaks during an interview with The Korea Times. / Courtesy of Startup:CON Barriers to innovation The hierarchical structure isn't just confined to Asia. The problem is not much different in the United States, he said. There are always barriers within any organization in the world and so there's a need to get through it, Kelley added. "Especially in hierarchical cultures you need to find some way to cut through the hierarchy with respect to ideas. My experience is, you have the support at the very top. I've never met a CEO who is not pro-innovation. So the support is there. It's just in some organizations, there's the energy at the top among visionaries and there's the energy among young new members of the team who want to change the world ― it only gets stuck in the middle." Cultural barriers to innovation are also not confined to a hierarchical system. In large established companies, there's "always the need to get today's work out perfectly," says Kelley. "Sometimes they don't have the time or attention to think of tomorrow. If you're too focused on getting today's work done ― the only job in front of you ― that's a barrier." Design thinking This is where design thinking comes in. Design thinking is a cognitive methodology and activity that helps people to develop creative ways to solve issues. Kelley puts it as "using the tool set or mindset of a designer ― such as designing objects or architecture ― and taking that same process and applying it to bigger issues such as designing a school system, designing new ways to interact with health services or rural villages to get better access to clean water." Simply put, it is "using the tool set or mindset of a designer for broader topics." Kelly says the three key tools for design thinking are empathy, experimentation and storytelling. "If you're a tech company, you need to blend technology with humanity. You need to bring your strengths to the table. Then the heart of the experiment must be that we're the kind of team that tries stuff. We will fail but we will still try stuff. You need to prototype. Finally, even with the best idea in the world, if you can't get other people to adopt it, it's not going to change anything. You need to take that concept and wrap it in a good story." IDEO, which his brother David Kelley founded and Tom Kelley is a partner at, is a company that has pioneered in design thinking for the past 30 years, creating human-centered products, services and spaces, and helping organizations innovate by empowering the people who drive them. Changing the culture What they have seen from the example of P&G, their most memorable client which saw success from applying design thinking to their company, was that the role of a middle manager or those with significant authority who were able to "pick up the ball" was crucial in initiating creative projects. "We collectively changed the culture of P&G during that era. It included support from the top, but that's not enough. Claudia (Kotchka), a leader with a big personality, a lot of stamina, and with permission from the CEO, systematically drove design thinking within P&G. She was vice president for design innovation and strategy and had the respect which went with her high position but she didn't have direct authority with anyone she worked with. She had to convince them using the power of her arguments over the power of authority," Kelley said. "The same thing happened with Kaaren (Hanson), vice president of design innovation at Intuit. Top support was not enough. The executives said they'll do it but didn't come back and went on with their daily jobs. Nothing happened. So she picked up the ball. She created a program called Catalyst with nine people. They needed a series of successes. You need to point to a success or two for the skeptics. If you get to the successes, then you have entry proof to say 'Here's a situation where design thinking won the day,' as soon as people see that, they'll say 'yes I want some.'" Kelley says the P&G model is replicable. "Anybody with the right support and right energy can do that," he said. "It really changed P&G ― we saw it in their stock price, product introduction, and passion of individuals. They designed hands on experiences with design thinking, and realized this stuff actually worked. It wasn't persuading them but demonstrating for them. It was a different lens to look at their business. Even among the skeptics, when the early successes come out, they'd say, 'I want some of that. Get that for my division.'" However, success is not always measured as a number, he says. "A clear understanding of what success looks or feels like can be useful. There's not an obvious metric." Creative confidence Kelley, author of "Creative Confidence" and "The Art of Innovation," was nowhere near the artistic world. He was working in the finance, IT and consulting fields, before joining IDEO to work with his brother. He says working with creative people has transformed him. "You have to be vulnerable enough to be willing to try something you won't necessarily be good at right away and then you've got to be humble to realize how much you can learn," said Kelley. "To be honest, at some point in the early history of IDEO, we had some (employees with) MBAs from very prestigious schools who came in and thought they already knew what they needed to know and had trouble being team players with designers, engineers and anthropologists. We need to take the opposite approach. If you want to achieve creative confidence, you have to first acknowledge that you have something to learn." Being open to possibilities is the step to gaining creative confidence, he said. Newspaper innovation How can design thinking be applied to newspapers? "It's quite a challenge. It's an extremely challenging environment. It's not that a worthy competitor has stolen a bit of market share from us that we could steal back. It's not one core aspect of our business that is demonetized. It's hard to compete against free," he said. "I want to pay for news because I want journalism. Not somebody's opinion. I want somebody who's verified their facts. That is not free and somebody has to pay for it. I'm willing to pay my fair share of that." The newspaper industry has to figure out a way to innovate itself, said Kelley. "How might we sustain really good journalism through the next few decades? Very possibly the answer is not in print form."

Even when great ideas come up from the lowest of the hierarchical ladder, it is rarely delivered to the very top. The leadership shouts for innovation, but it often does not realize that innovation is within arm's reach. Letting ideas flow freely within an organization ― the open innovation platform ― is a critical factor in driving creative success for a company. "It's not okay from the CEO's perspective to say to that bright young person you just hired, 'if you have an idea, you have to sell the idea to your boss, your boss' boss and your boss' boss' boss before it has a chance of being implemented,'" said Tom Kelley, partner at IDEO, the world's first and largest design thinking consultancy which started off in Palo Alto, California. "Some people you hire for their deep technical excellence, but they don't always have the communication skills to sell the idea to the hierarchy. As an outsider, I don't want to shake up the hierarchy, I want to go to the CEO and say 'Look, you've earned the right to be the boss, to make the hiring decisions, but don't let the hierarchy get in the way of the free flow of ideas,'" he said during an interview with The Korea Times. Kelley was in Seoul to give a speech at Startup:CON (Oct. 11-12), a conference for startups and innovators, organized by the Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA). "In all such cultures, you've got to find a way to have that idea float, go up and down the hierarchy, through an open innovation platform inside the company -- whether it be poster-days or internal trade fairs ― or some way that systematically floats ideas up and down. You have to have a way," he said. Tom Kelley speaks during an interview with The Korea Times. / Courtesy of Startup:CON Barriers to innovation The hierarchical structure isn't just confined to Asia. The problem is not much different in the United States, he said. There are always barriers within any organization in the world and so there's a need to get through it, Kelley added. "Especially in hierarchical cultures you need to find some way to cut through the hierarchy with respect to ideas. My experience is, you have the support at the very top. I've never met a CEO who is not pro-innovation. So the support is there. It's just in some organizations, there's the energy at the top among visionaries and there's the energy among young new members of the team who want to change the world ― it only gets stuck in the middle." Cultural barriers to innovation are also not confined to a hierarchical system. In large established companies, there's "always the need to get today's work out perfectly," says Kelley.

There’s plenty of facts out there on why recycling is important. The world population is growing, not shrinking, and currently each human being adds significant waste to the planet over his or her lifetime. The most frustrating thing is that in our beautiful state of Yucatan, neither society nor government seems to be concerned about the importance of recycling. It is vital that we create awareness among the local population, and let everybody know that the natural resources on our planet earth are limited and we must make the most to conserve, recycle and reuse whenever possible. It’s not all too difficult to make a difference. 1) Yucatan is not among the top recycling states in Mexico 2) TerraCycle subscriptions number has grown over 200% 3) 47% of the Recycling leading personalities are Millenials 4) Women are more concerned about Recycling than men (Image: TerraCycle) Michael Waas is TerraCycle’s Global Vice President, in charge of Business Development and Client Services, he is responsible for managing and expanding TerraCycle’s 100+ national recycling programs. The programs recycle traditionally non-recyclable waste streams and are run in conjunction with major brands partners (including L’Oreal, Bimbo, Kraft Foods, PepsiCo, Mondelez, P&G, and many more). TerraCycle operates in 20 countries and has pioneered solutions for recycling some of the most challenging waste streams in the world, including chip bags, water filters, cigarette butts, cosmetic packaging and more. TerraCycle’s award-winning programs engage tens of millions of consumers and have diverted billions of pieces of waste; since 2007 the company has paid more than $10 million to schools and non profits in return for waste collected through the programs. Michael joined TerraCycle in 2008 after a chance meeting with founder Tom Szaky through the StartingBloc fellowship. He holds a bachelors in Music and Political Science and an M.A. in Political Science from Central Michigan University. Michael Waas (Photo: TerraCycle) Here is the full interview: Hi Michael, thank you so much for agreeing to have this interview, it is a pleasure to have you here in Mexico and we hope you have a great stay! TerraCycle is known all over the world. Nevertheless, there are some people in Mexico who still don’t know about it. What is Terracycle? What is its purpose and how does The company work? TerraCycle is a global company known for recycling typically non-recyclable materials. Its purpose is to eliminate the idea of waste, meaning we don’t want there to be the concept of waste but rather to have people think about things being repurposed, reused or recycled. The company has several ways it gets the materials we recycle. In Mexico, we have free collection programs that are sponsored by companies that want to take responsibility for their products or packaging. Anyone can sign up for these on our website. What kind of waste is the most interesting to collect for Terracycle and why? We think every kind of waste is interesting to collect, but we really like to collect the most difficult to recycle items that take up a lot of space in landfills. What products can be created with the recycled waste? We recycle the materials into a plastic that can be used in any product that manufacturers want to use recycled plastic. That means the plastic can be used for park benches, garbage bins, bike racks, picnic tables, and much, much more. TerraCycle currently runs over 100 waste collection programs. What is it like having to work with these programs together with the different cultures and traditions around the world?  It can be challenging, but it’s great. We make sure we have a good understanding of the cultures and traditions before we launch in a country. Our employees are often native to that country so that also helps.   Michael Waas and members of the TerraCycle Team in CDMX (Photo: TerraCycle) To date, what recycling program has been the most challenging to create and why? Each of the packaging or products have their own challenges, but those made of multiple materials or layers have the potential to be more difficult and costly because ideally, you want to separate  the materials and recycle them individually. Each recycling program is possible thanks to the partners that work alongside TerraCycle. What is the main ingredient when looking for partnerships with different brands? We love working with companies who recognize the importance of taking responsibility for their packaging and who want to make an impact environmentally. We also look for companies that want to embrace their partnership with us. We are well aware of the success of the programs involving cosmetic packaging and cigarette butts. What other programs would you like to develop in the future? Everything! We want to tackle waste that takes up space in landfills, but shouldn’t have to if there was a way to recycle it. What opportunities do you see in Mexico that you haven’t seen anywhere else? In Mexico, we see a growing movement toward environmental responsibility and an increasing number of companies and individuals who want to take action to reduce landfill waste. Not that we don’t see that elsewhere, but it’s exciting to see it happening in Mexico.  Can you tell us anything about the future programs in Mexico? We have a lot of exciting things in the works for Mexico and when we are able to launch them, they will be the first of their kind in the world.  Michael Waas (Photo: TerraCycle) Thank you so much for your time, Michael, We hope you have a great time in Mexico City. About TerraCycle Mexico: In the month of September TerraCycle Mexico celebrated its 7th anniversary by collecting and recycling waste around the Mexican Republic; said this left a reminder of how we can become collectors within the country and not only contribute to the best of our environment also remunerate other non-profit associations. The most recent number that has been donatied is $ 409,936.74 pesos. Some of the associations that have benefited are: APANICAL (Association of Parents of Children with Cancer and Leukemia) – Located in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, has received $ 135.360 pesos. High School 20 Juan F. Escamilla -received $ 22.999 pesos, this school is located in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon. Francisco I. Madero School In Mezquitic, Jalisco received $ 20.029 pesos. Operation Smile-In Zapopan, Jalisco received $ 16.185 pesos.

"The combined overall revenue of selected eight MNCs during the FY 16 registered a total of $9,436.66 million, whereas the combined revenue of selected seven Indian FMCG is $11,066.46 million," the Assocham-TechSci Research report said. According to the joint study, which observed performance analysis of selected Indian FMCG companies, the highest profit after tax margin is maintained at 25.48% by ITC during 2015-16, as compared to Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Health Care among selected leading MNC players in FMCG sector in India, which maintained the highest profit after tax margin at 17.03%. The study stated that Britannia Industries stood second among firms in terms of revenue of $1,222.75 million during 2015-16 and has registered revenue growth of 10.76% as compared to 2014-15. However, its after-taxes profit margin (PAT) stood at 9.43%, which is comparatively lower than its peers in the sector. The performance of Dabur India is next to ITC in terms of PAT registered at 16.34%, followed by Godrej Consumer Products at 15.37%, the report said. "About the performance of Amul, although the company has revenue $743.69 million, which is slightly more than Godrej Consumer Products Ltd., its PAT margin is least amongst others at just 0.32%," the joint study said. "In case of Amul, the reason can be the fact of controlled prices and nature of milk and milk-made products." After analysing the performance of selected multinational companies of FMCG sector in India, the study has observed that Hindustan Unilever is leading with its revenue of $4,921.10 million with 3.84% year-on-year growth in the revenue. However, the PAT margin of the company during the year is $628.06 million or 12.76%, which is comparatively lower than its competitor. The report further cited that the performance of Glaxosmithkline Consumer Healthcare has recorded 15.94% PAT margin, followed by Colgate-Palmolive (India) with 13.85 PAT margin. About the performance of PepsiCo India, the report added that the company could not make it possible to have satisfactory overall profit as there was negative PAT margin by 2.18%.

Photo: Getty October 29th 2016 18 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/USA/ FBI Director James Comey who is leading a new investigation into emails related to Hillary Clinton’s private server. Picture: AP Shoba RaoNews Corp Australia Network Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend FBI Director James Comey has sent shockwaves through Hillary Clinton’s campaign after he announced a new review of her emails. The US Senate’s top Democrat, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, has already blasted him for announcing his new review just days before the presidential election, an action he says “may have broken the law.” Allegations Clinton put the United States at risk by using a private email server while US Secretary of State were thrust back into the spotlight when Comey revealed a renewed FBI probe into the matter based on a previously unknown trove of emails. “As soon as you came into possession of the slightest innuendo related to secretary Clinton, you rushed to publicise it in the most negative light possible,” Reid said. “Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law,” Reid added, alleging that Comey had violated the Hatch Act, which bars the FBI from influencing elections. Ms Clinton has demanded the FBI director explain in detail why he had effectively reopened an inquiry declared complete in July, branding Comey’s move “deeply troubling” so close to Election Day. FBI Director James Comey’s announcement that his bureau was reviewing new emails possibly relevant to Hillary Clinton's private email server investigation has thrust him into the public spotlight again just days before Election Day. Picture: APSource:AP According to US media, the probe was renewed after agents seized a laptop used by Clinton’s close aide, Huma Abedin, and her now estranged husband, Anthony Weiner. Comey, a New York native, was made the director of the FBI in 2013 for a 10-year term which will carry on into the new US president’s administration. With a background in corporate law, government, banking and the arms trade, he came to the attention of former US President George W Bush who appointed him deputy attorney general at the Department of Justice (DOJ) in 2003. Comey left DOJ in 2005 to work at one of the world’s largest defence contractors, Lockheed Martin. In 2013, he became the FBI’s leading chief. These are some of the facts we know about him: FBI Director James Comey is at the centre of the renewed FBI email investigation. Picture: APSource:AP COMEY IS A WEALTHY REPUBLICAN Comey is a Republican party member with a reported a net worth of more than US$11 million (AU$14.4 million), CNN reports. Comey and his wife, Patrice, previously listed about US$5 million (AU$6 million) in stocks with a US Senate Committee when he was a nominee for the FBI’s director role. Their investments included a Schwab government money fund, Exxon Mobil, Pepsico, Berkshire Hathaway, Verizon Communications, Proctor & Gamble Co. and Hormel Foods. The couple also said they owned a home worth around US$3 million (AU$3.9 million) in Westport, Connecticut, where he and his wife are licensed foster care parents. In late 2011, the Comeys took in “a newborn boy born prematurely with cocaine in his blood stream and cared for him for six months until he could be placed with a foster-adoptive mother”. The Comeys also donated money to create a foundation to help children in foster care. They are parents to five children: Maurene, Katherine, Brien, Claire and Abby. Pence on Clinton: "no one is above the law"0:32 Republican Vice Presidential nominee Mike Pence says FBI Director James Comey was right in notifying Congress that his agency was again reviewing its investigation into the emails of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton days before the election. October 31st 2016 16 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ COMEY DISPUTED AMERICA’S WIRETAPPING PROGRAM While working for the Bush administration, Comey questioned a plan to re-authorise its warrantless domestic surveillance program, which led to him drafting a letter of resignation in 2004. While he never sent his letter, he told a Senate Judiciary Committee in 2007 that when he temporarily became in charge of the Justice Department, he refused to re-authorise a secret National Security Agency warrantless wiretap program that the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel determined was illegal. In Comey’s drafted resignation letter, which was published by The Washington Post, he said “the Justice Department and I have been asked to be part of something that is fundamentally wrong.” Shortly after, Comey privately met with Bush, who agreed to “do the right thing, and put the program on a footing that we could certify its legality,” Comey said. President Barack Obama, followed by FBI Director James Comey, arrives in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington. Picture: APSource:AP HE WAS APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA In 2013, President Barack Obama selected Comey, the former Bush-appointed Republican as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. His appointment came after Comey was a known financial supporter of Republicans John McCain and Mitt Romney in their bids to become US president. COMEY PROSECUTED MARTHA STEWART When celebrity lifestyle expert Martha Stewart was charged in 2003 of illegal insider trading, Comey was the man who brought the charges against her. ‘’This criminal case is about lying — lying to the FBI, lying to the SEC, lying to investors,” Comey said at the time, when he was the US attorney for the Southern District of New York. ‘’Martha Stewart is being prosecuted not for who she is, but because of what she did.’’ Stewart was convicted on all counts in 2004 and spent five months in jail. Martha Stewart was one of the high-profile cases that James Comey pursued. Picture: GettySource:Getty Images HE’S INVESTIGATED THE CLINTONS BEFORE Comey’s first investigation of the Clintons was back in the mid-1990s, when he joined the Senate Whitewater Committee as a deputy special counsel. He looked into allegations that the Clintons took part in a fraud connected to a failed Arkansas real estate venture. No charges were ever brought against the Clintons. In 2002 Comey took over an investigation into President Bill Clinton’s 2001 pardon of financier Marc Rich. As a federal prosecutor, Comey looked into Rich, who had been indicted before fleeing the US. At the time, there were accusations that Rich’s ex-wife Denise donated to the Democratic Party, the Clinton Library and Hillary Clinton’s 2000 Senate campaign. In the end, Comey decided not to pursue the case. US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has been linked to another email server probe. Picture: AFPSource:AFP At the FBI, Comey was also involved in the first Clinton email inquiry, which closed without charges in July. Mr Comey said at the time that Mrs Clinton had been “extremely careless” but no criminal charges were warranted. It has now only just resurfaced after Comey alerted members of Congress to the existence of emails that he said could be pertinent to that investigation. The FBI has obtained a warrant to begin reviewing newly discovered emails from longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin that were found on a device seized during an unrelated sexting investigation of Anthony Weiner, a former New York congressman and Abedin’s estranged husband. The official, who has knowledge of the examination, would not say when investigators might complete the review of Abedin’s emails but said they would move expeditiously. In his letter that roiled the White House race, Comey said he’d been briefed about the Abedin emails and had agreed that investigators should take steps to review them. Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks during a rally. Picture: AFPSource:AFP COMEY DOESN’T GIVE A ‘HOOT’ ABOUT POLITICS In July this year, Comey told a US Senate Committee looking at the Clinton email inquiry that he “didn’t give a hoot about politics”. In his own words, he said: “People can disagree, can agree, but they will at least understand that the decision was made and the recommendation was made the way you would want it to be, by people who didn’t give a hoot about politics, who cared about what are the facts, what is the law, and how similar people, all people have been treated in the past.” Despite this, the timing of Comey’s letter less than two weeks before Election Day drew criticism from Democrats and some Republicans who cast it as unprecedented and as potentially tipping the scales in the presidential race in favour of Republican Donald Trump. Energised by the news, the GOP presidential nominee has rallied his supporters, calling the latest developments “worse than Watergate” and arguing that his candidacy has the momentum in the final days of the race. — with wires Add your comment to this story Comments Form Enter your comment here * 1200 characters left Your details Name (as it will appear on the site)* Email Address * Location (optional) Post Options Remember my details Email me if my comment is published News.com.au's Privacy Policy includes important information about our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information (including to provide you with targeted content and advertising based on your online activities).

GoSearch CLTV TV Schedule Search Contact Us CLTV Menu News SportsFeed Politics Tonight Traffic Weather Channel Finder Shows on CLTV Meet Leslie Munger, candidate for Illinois comptroller Posted 9:27 PM, October 30, 2016, by WGN Web Desk, Updated at 09:47pm, October 30, 2016 Share Update: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Please enable Javascript to watch this video CHICAGO -- Born and raised in Joliet, Republican Leslie Munger is the Illinois comptroller. The businesswoman turned politician is running to keep the job. As comptroller, Munger is the bookkeeper responsible for maintaining the state’s account, and payments in and out of it. That’s no easy job for a state that spends more than it takes in. "Our state simply does not have enough revenue to meet the obligations that we are currently facing," she said. "We need a balanced budget." On her website, Munger keeps a tally of the state’s bill backlog -- $9 billion! Following the death of Judy Baar Topinka in 2014, Munger was appointed comptroller by Gov. Bruce Rauner. "I feel like our state needs people who are willing to step up and serve. I don’t need this job. I actually came out of my nice life to take this appointment," she said. That life was a volunteer in her hometown of Lakeshire following a career in brand marketing. Munger was an executive at Proctor & Gamble and Helene Curtis Industries. She once managed the Suave brand with its various shampoos, lotions, soaps and deodorants. "They called it 'hope in a bottle!'" she said. Munger has not had much to say about her fellow businessman Donald Trump. But she did tell us she thinks he’s successful. "I don’t know enough about his business practices he’s got here, but I will tell you, he’s employed a lot of people and we need to employ more people here in Illinois," she said. To create more jobs here in Illinois, Munger is walking in step with Rauner, backing increases in revenue tied to pro-business reforms. For more than a year, Illinois has been floating along without a budget while the state’s unpaid bills pile up. As the person who must choose which organizations to pay, Munger is trying to turn up the heat on Springfield lawmakers. "For years, our legislature found ways to hide bills, have agencies hold them, sit on them for the last quarter, send them into the next fiscal year. To encourage lawmakers to pass a balanced budget Munger is proposing a "no budget, no pay" bill. Under the legislation, lawmakers would not get their salary until the state gets a budget. It will be a tough sell for state legislators, but Munger still talks about it in her campaign commercial. In this campaign, Munger blew the lid off the donation limits accepting a $260,000 loan from her husband. It allowed her to accept millions from wealthy donors and it allows the state GOP to transfer money into other races. Munger says the move was necessary to get the Republican message out. "I’m following laws passed by the Democrats, voted on by my opponent, and it really allowed them to advantage themselves in past elections to bring in money through the Speaker to shuffle it to other candidates all throughout their party," she said. Munger and her Democratic opponent Susana Mendoza are in the middle of a proxy war. Rauner and his business allies are pumping money into Munger’s campaign while House Speaker Michael Madigan and big unions fun Mendoza. The winner will serve for two years. Mendoza will be featured on Monday's WGN News at Nine.

The wipes can cause blockages – creating 'fatbergs' as they soak up fat in sewers – as well as polluting rivers and seas with tiny plastic fibres. They have surged in popularity in recent years to cover a huge range of purposes, ranging from cleaning babies and removing cosmetics to wiping furniture and dirty floors. Warnings that wet wipes are not flushable are not highly visible at present – something the industry's trade body said its members will rectify. File image As the Daily Mail reported last week, warnings that wipes are not flushable are not highly visible at present – something the industry's trade body said its members will rectify. Now leading manufacturers will have to reconsider guidelines on packaging and have pledged to change them within 18 months.

Share this article Share The companies include Unilever, which makes the Simple range of beauty wipes, Procter & Gamble, which makes Pampers baby wipes, and Johnson & Johnson, which also produces baby wipes. Edana, the European body for firms producing 'non-woven fabrics', said yesterday: 'We accept we could have done better on this. The makers of wet wipes have agreed to re-label products with warnings not to flush them down the toilet. File image 'All these products should have 'do not flush' logos and labels at the point of extraction – meaning around the lid or other opening – rather than the back of the packet.' The move is set to cover non-flushable wipes. However, there is growing concern over many products marked as 'flushable' that water companies say do not actually break up once down the toilet. The trade body Water UK has called on trading standards officers to investigate whether wipes claiming to be flushable are mislabelled. The industry may be keen to avoid consumer discontent similar to that which engulfed microbeads – tiny abrasive plastic spheres used in cleansing products – which have been criticised for polluting waterways and harming fish and other marine animals all over the world. Tamara Galloway, professor of ecotoxicology at Exeter University, told the Sunday Times: 'We find microplastics in every sea water sample we collect, and most are fibres. 'The UK coast isn't the only area. Scientists around the world are reporting fibres in sea water, fresh water and sediment. We've also found them in the guts of fish and turtles and the tissues of other animals.' However, Edana maintained that 'flushable' wet wipes do disintegrate when disposed of. Edana said: 'Toilet wet wipes for adults may look similar, but they are made of cellulose so break down rapidly in sewers, whereas beauty wipes and baby wipes have to be much stronger and so are made of materials like polyester.' Water companies spend approximately £88million a year clearing an estimated 360,000 blockages, half of which are caused by the disposal of wet wipes. The British market for wet wipes is estimated to be worth about £500million. In the United States, wet wipe manufacturers face a series of law suits from householders in several states over claims that their products are flushable – but consumers claim they have suffered blockages and other damage from the products.

Awaiting the birth of her third child, she dreaded what she called the “awful labour” of washing, drying and ironing cloth nappies. Surprised there was no alternative, she determined to invent one. The result was a two-part system, the Paddi: an adjustable waterproof outer garment holding a discardable, biodegradable pad, made of cellulose wadding covered over with cotton wool. She received a patent for the invention in October 1949. The first 400 she made at her kitchen table with a Singer sewing machine, selling them to friends for five shillings apiece. Boots began to sell her nappies in all their branches in 1950, after a Lancet article argued disposable nappies helped reduce baby rashes. Seventy-two thousand of them sold in 1950, then, in 1951, 250,000. By 1960, the number was 6m. The American company Procter & Gamble began producing the all-in-one Pampers from 1961, which, though not biodegradable, were cheaper. The Paddi entered a slow decline in sales, the last rolling of the assembly line in 1990. Hunter Gordon’s subsequent inventions included the Nikini, one of the first modern sanitary towels, in 1954, and a house which she continually redesigned to spare household labour. Rather than ironing, she pressed shirts by placing them under the carpet. Tiring of polishing her family’s mahogany table, she made a plastic top, saying “if anybody important comes to stay, we’ll take it off”. It never came off, including during a visit to her house by Margaret Thatcher. Hunter Gordon’s drawing room became a laboratory of invention, with her children Nigel and Frances often roped in to serve as models. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Boots began to sell Valerie Hunter Gordon’s nappies in all their branches in 1950 Daughter of Sir Vincent Ziani de Ferranti, and his wife, Dorothy (nee Wilson), she was born in the Peak District, in the small Derbyshire village of Baslow, into a family of inventors. Her grandfather, Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti, was an Italian-Liverpudlian electrical engineer. Being one of the few experts on alternating-current electricity in Britain, in 1891 he designed the world’s first modern power station, at Deptford, south-east London. Valerie’s father oversaw the expansion of the family business, Ferranti, into a major manufacturer of radios and televisions, involved too in defence electronics and early postwar computing. Valerie was frequently in and out of her grandfather’s house, living nearby until his death in 1930. He worked often at home, and was fond of sharing with his granddaughter how his inventions worked, and his vision of the use of technology and innovation to improve daily lives. “I suspect that is where she learned if you have a need, and it’s not fulfilled, then maybe you could do something about it yourself,” said her son Nigel. “I know that he loved to tell her about all the things he was doing, and she loved to listen to it.” She attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart school, in Roehampton, south-west London, run by a French teaching order of nuns. (After the second world war, the school relocated to the Surrey village of Woldingham, and presently exists as Woldingham school.) In 1940, she married a Scottish major and electrical engineer, Patrick Hunter Gordon. Both her father and husband were involved in the retreat from Dunkirk – her father leading a group home to safety on discarded motorbikes, by way of the Spanish border, arriving home just in time for their wedding. When Patrick left the army in 1950, the family moved to Beauly, 10 miles west of Inverness. He took over a family business, AI Welders and Cable Belts. He suffered from post-traumatic illness, in which she was a constant support; he, in turn, requisitioned surplus parachute nylon for her experiments, helped her test early designs with families of army colleagues, and encouraged her to bring forward the product commercially. Her father also was an unflagging supporter. Hunter Gordon wrote to the nappy-makers Robinsons of Chesterfield, who initially were sceptical due to a failed related experiment in the 1930s. At a Royal Society dinner, her father then found himself seated beside the company’s chairman, Sir Robert Robinson – which resulted in her getting a second hearing and an invitation to Chesterfield. She convinced the company to produce them in bulk, paying her royalties, starting in late 1949. Those familiar with Hunter Gordon describe her as pragmatic and insightful, with a wicked sense of humour and ability to see straight to the nub of a subject. Supremely confident in her own judgment, she was nonetheless personally modest and self-effacing.

Technavio defines an emerging trend as a factor that has the potential to significantly impact the market and contribute to its growth or decline. Brijesh Kumar Choubey, a lead analyst from Technavio, specializing in research on cosmetics and toiletry sector, says, "Consumer demand for customized hair solutions that address specific concerns has been growing in the haircare market in Africa. A growing number of consumers in the region are preferring products that protect the scalp and hair quality and repair damage." Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=53808 Technavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. The top three emerging trends driving the haircare market in Africa according to Technavio consumer and retail research analysts are: Partnership of vendors with salons to gain visibility and establish products Growing use of online channel by brands Leveraging social media platforms Partnership of vendors with salons to gain visibility and establish products Hair salons are booming in South Africa and many manufacturers are partnering with these salons to gain visibility and establish their products in the market. Some popular salons in Nigeria are Apples Oranges, Bruno's Palace, Make Me Beauty Place, Touch of Glamour, and Bobby's Signature. The Darling brand, a key brand in hair extension products on the continent, has strong presence at salons and is a preferred brand by hair stylists. Modern Hair Beauty (formerly Wella SA) distributes the products of multiple brands such as System Professional, Sebastian Professional, Kadus Professional, and Nioxin. Many beauty salon chains also have their own chain of beauty and cosmetics products. Popular professional hair serums available are It's A 10 Miracle Styling Serum Hair Styling Products, Phyto Phytolisse Ultra-Glossing Finishing Serum, Phyto Phytocyane Revitalizing Serum, and TIGI Bed Head Control Freak Serum. Growing use of online channel by brands E-commerce is growing in South Africa. The number of Internet users in the country has grown substantially over the years and e-retailers are looking to tap into this consumer segment. Business to consumer's web portals operate orders on nationwide basis in many of the East African countries, and register nearly 1,000 orders per day in certain territories. The online channel is expected to develop significantly over the next five years, fueled by the emerging middle-class population. Africa's middle-class population is growing in number and financial strength. Also, by 2050, almost 50% of the continent is expected to have access to the Internet and online shopping will grow to account for at least 11% of retail sales. Jumia, a Nigeria-based online retailer, is one of the key players in the e-commerce business. E-commerce platforms such as Mall For Africa connect the region's customers with global brands. Such platforms serve as a conduit for customers to access more than 150 global brands. Most of its customers prefer purchasing US and UK based brands. Mall For Africa has also created an MFA WebCard that can be loaded with US dollars to function like a debit card in order to simplify the e-commerce experience of its customers. Leveraging social media platforms "Social media marketing is being implemented extensively by almost every company to ensure enhanced product visibility," says Brijesh. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, WhatsApp, and YouTube are the most powerful social media platforms. L'Oréal launched its campaign named LoveMyColor in 2016 through a microsite LoveMyColor.com. This campaign was designed to relaunch the company's Dark and Lovely Fade Resist hair color brand for black women. The campaign is also featured on Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, and YouTube. In 2016, P&G, under its My Black is Beautiful initiative launched the hair truth campaign, a community building program aimed at educating consumers with curly hair or African hair. The campaign unites the P&G brands Pantene, Head Shoulder, Herbal Essences, and Aussie. The program features five informative webisodes and includes educational components on social media.

"The combined overall revenue of selected eight MNCs during the FY 16 registered a total of $9,436.66 million, whereas the combined revenue of selected seven Indian FMCG is $11,066.46 million," the Assocham-TechSci Research report said. According to the joint study, which observed performance analysis of selected Indian FMCG companies, the highest profit after tax margin is maintained at 25.48 per cent by ITC during 2015-16, as compared to Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Health Care among selected leading MNC players in FMCG sector in India, which maintained the highest profit after tax margin at 17.03 per cent. The study stated that Britannia Industries stood second among firms in terms of revenue of $1,222.75 million during 2015-16 and has registered revenue growth of 10.76 per cent as compared to 2014-15. However, its after-taxes profit margin (PAT) stood at 9.43 per cent, which is comparatively lower than its peers in the sector. The performance of Dabur India is next to ITC in terms of PAT registered at 16.34 per cent, followed by Godrej Consumer Products at 15.37 per cent, the report said. "About the performance of Amul, although the company has revenue $743.69 million, which is slightly more than Godrej Consumer Products Ltd., its PAT margin is least amongst others at just 0.32 per cent," the joint study said. "In case of Amul, the reason can be the fact of controlled prices and nature of milk and milk-made products." After analysing the performance of selected multinational companies of FMCG sector in India, the study has observed that Hindustan Unilever is leading with its revenue of $4,921.10 million with 3.84 per cent year-on-year growth in the revenue.

most up-to-date research on Global Cosmetic Serum Market 2016-2020. (EMAILWIRE.COM, October 31, 2016 ) About Cosmetic Serum A Cosmetic Serum is a product applied externally for a desired cosmetic effect. It is usually a water-based non-greasy and intensive formula that contains a high concentration of active substances. Serums can also be oil and water based but have an oil-free texture (owing to choice and less concentration of oil used in formulation), which helps serums to penetrate deeper. Serums contain high concentrations of active ingredients, so are usually made to contain just a few active ingredients. Serums can be used at any age for delivering the desired action of antioxidants, moisturizing, nourishing, and energizing.

Asian Scientist Newsroom | October 27, 2016 | Academia AsianScientist (Oct. 31, 2016) - The National University of Singapore (NUS) won in three categories of the Institution of Chemical Engineers’ (IChemE) awards, part of IChemE’s Global Awards program which celebrates excellence and innovation in chemical engineering. A collaborative team from NUS and Iowa State University received the Energy Award for their project ‘Resource recovery from wastes,’ a novel waste treatment technology that converts urban waste streams into biofuels and other useful products. NUS also picked up the Research Project of the Year Award for their project ‘Membrane dehumidifiers to reduce energy consumption,’ in which the team have developed foil-like membranes to sieve out water molecules in air conditioning systems, reducing energy consumption by 35 percent. Ms. He Jinsong from NUS was named best Young Chemical Engineer in Research, sponsored by Shell. After narrowly missing out on the award in 2014 and 2015, her latest work has seen her develop a full-scale production system for decontaminating water. The Institute of Chemical and Engineering Sciences, part of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research, took the Process Safety Award, sponsored by MMI Engineering. The institute was recognized for their development of safety and environmental assessment. Their combined approach enables engineers to balance risk to the environment and workforce safety, to minimize potential trade-offs. There were winners from industry as well. Ms. Betty Tsai of Proctor & Gamble International took the trophy for Young Chemical Engineer in Industry, also sponsored by Shell. Her work at P&G is focused on skincare consumer products, where she has designed the innovation process from start to finish. Glaxo Wellcome Manufacturing took the Sustainable Technology Award, for their Jurong waste heat recovery project which saw them produce enough steam from waste heat to run their site at 1 Pioneer Sector 1, significantly reducing their carbon footprint. ——— Source: Institution of Chemical Engineers.

(Photo: Provided) United Way of Greater Cincinnati announced Friday it had surpassed the $62.1 million fundraising goal for 2016, according to a release. United Way leaders emphasized that funds will go toward increasing participation in quality preschool, getting 3,000 more families support through home visiting, and preparing 15,000 more people for in-demand jobs. “Reaching this goal is a shining example of our community coming together to create life-changing moments for individuals and families in our region,” said Robert C. Reifsnyder, president, United Way of Greater Cincinnati. “We are committed to ensuring children get off to a strong start and achieve success in school, helping families build financial stability, and providing people with the ability to live healthier lives. Whether you contributed a major gift or a dollar a week, we thank you.” The campaign, which began Aug. 24, saw significant donations from area businesses. The Vora Group was recognized by United Way as the top new business participant in this year’s campaign, with P&G once again holding the number one spot among the Top 25 supporters. This year's fundraising effort was led by Cincinnati Bell CEO Ted Torbeck. “I am amazed at the generosity of our community, and the commitment to United Way to make life better for all of us who live here,” Torbeck said. “Many organizations and individuals increased their gifts to meet this goal, and I’d like to thank everyone who contributed to this year’s campaign.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 30, 2016 at 3:31PM Walk down the aisles of your local grocery store or big box retailer, and you are faced with a sometimes overwhelming selection of thousands of products. But even then, that is only a small subset of the more than one million items available to consumers each year. In this Industry Focus: Consumer Goods segment, the cast considers the challenges of competing in an environment with seemingly limitless consumer options and what that implies for consumer staples manufacturers like Unilever and Procter & Gamble. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 12, 2016. Vincent Shen: I really wanted to hammer the point home in terms of how important these efforts can be for companies by stepping back a little bit and giving a little bit of a big picture context and calling out some numbers that I think can put things into perspective. For example, in 2008 research from the Food Marketing Institute the typical U.S. grocery store, or supermarket, stocked about 47,000 different products. That is up 50% from the previous decade and about five-fold since 1975. Keep in mind that a Wal-Mart Supercenter, for example, their SKU numbers for a store that size is well over 100,000. And then if you go a step further, researching the case at any one time in the United States, there are at least one million products on the market for consumers to purchase. So that research might be a few years old now, so with some of the other trends that we've seen, you can imagine that number is likely much larger than one million at this point with customization, for example. So the sobering reality I think for a lot of retailers, be it Unilever or Procter & Gamble, is that consumers only use about 340 unique items in a year out of that one million-plus. And making sure that you are maximizing your profitability, maximizing your product mix and what is on store shelves, to boost your revenue and make sure that that small subset of items that each consumer uses includes products from your portfolio, is just really important. Is there any other thoughts that you wanted to leave our listeners with, Asit? Asit Sharma: Just one last thought. And by the way, those are some mind-boggling statistics and I think that really visually gives us an idea of how much supply there is out there of product and why it's a great idea to reduce as much as you can if you're a manufacturer. My last point is that we see the Pareto Principle in life a lot, which is 80% of outputs are due to 20% of inputs. See that in so many different spheres of life, and manufacturers have found this to be very true ... SKU and brand rationalization, that a lot of times it's just a few products that are really driving your sales and your profits, so why wouldn't you put in the effort to pare those down and optimize your profit and optimize your cash flow? As investors, we should be looking for the companies which are actively trying to perform this exercise. And the two companies we've mentioned today are really into this. Their management talks about these concepts almost every conference call, we see it in the numbers, and it's a great way to evaluate a consumer goods company. Are they paying attention to the proliferation of products that they've got, and are they trying to make themselves more efficient as time goes on? Asit Sharma has no position in any stocks mentioned. Vincent Shen has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool recommends Procter & Gamble and Unilever.

LGBTQ Nation dives into “the great gay holiday” and Halloween’s LGBT influence. 2. Hillary Clinton gave a speech at a campaign rally at an LGBT club in Wilton Manors, Florida on Sunday. She called for passage of the Equality Act, rejected so-called “conversion therapy” and more. 3. “North Carolina panicked and made a spectacle of itself by passing HB 2, its so-called ‘bathroom bill.’ In response, various companies and even sports leagues pulled events from the state. Three of those have wound up in Salem ― the NCAA Division III men’s and women’s soccer championships, as well as the Division II Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association football championship. That’s money in the bank for us.” Here’s one endorsement North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory will not be touting. The Roanoke Times in Virginia endorsed McCrory because his anti-LGBT law HB2 is driving business out of his state and into theirs. 4. The Human Rights Campaign revoked an endorsement for the first time ever following Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk’s racist comments directed at his opponent Tammy Duckworth during a televised debate last week. 5.

Randall Stephenson, chairman and chief executive officer of AT&T, left, speaks while Jeff Bewkes, chairman and chief executive officer of Time Warner, listens during the WSJDLive Global Technology Conference last Tuesday. Credit: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg Most Popular Since AT&T agreed to buy Time Warner for $85.4 billion, executives and the press have suggested that the combination will benefit marketers and consumers with a new level of addressable advertising. "Our TV, mobile and broadband distribution and direct customer relationships provide unique insights from which we can offer addressable advertising and better tailor content," AT&T Chairman-CEO Randall Stephenson said in announcing the deal Oct. 22. The tie-up will allow "more innovation in advertising," Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said, making ads "more effective and of interest to you in one house versus someone else in a different house." "Individualized Ads on TV Could Be One Result of AT&T-Time Warner Merger," The New York Times reported Wednesday. Whatever benefits the pact has, however, a lot more addressable TV advertising isn't likely among them. If the deal closes, it's true that sales teams at Time Warner's Turner unit will probably be able to offer the addressable ads that AT&T already sells through DirecTV. Turner networks such as TBS and CNN could make their national ad time available to AT&T's addressable offering, now limited to the two minutes per hour pay-TV operators sell. And combining AT&T and Time Warner's consumer data could bolster the companies' ad targeting online, including in new video products down the road. But the odds are long that any of that means neighbors watching the NBA on TNT will see differing, tailored ads more often than today. For one thing, AT&T's addressable TV advertising is available for 14 million households among DirecTV subscribers. Buying Time Warner doesn't expand that. And marketers care more about wider reach than additional time in a limited pool. An AT&T spokeswoman said the merger will foster innovation across screens. "The combined company will be positioned to expand distribution options to disrupt traditional models by making content available on every device and innovating with more ad-supported content," she said. "We'll still have big screen TVs at home, but wide-scale mobile video viewing is what customers want. As a single company, we are uniquely positioned to deliver on this mobile experience, and disrupt the traditional entertainment model by pushing the boundaries on mobile content availability for the benefit of customers." A Time Warner spokesman referred to executives' prior comments. Ad buyers and analysts are mixed on the prospects. Related Stories Addressable TV Ads Will Surge 120% This Year (to a Very Small Slice of Total) A satellite operator like AT&T's DirecTV can adopt addressable technology more easily than cable companies, which have grown by acquiring a patchwork of rivals running different systems, noted Tracey Scheppach, founder and CEO at Matter More Media, a new agency. "Cable operators need to deploy technology on a market-by-market basis to enable addressability, whereas the architecture for AT&T and DirecTV require just turning on an East Coast and West Coast feed," she said. Owning a content provider such as Time Warner also eases the way to offering and measuring its inventory, an area ripe for friction in carriage negotiations with outsiders, she said. Rich Greenfield, media analyst at BTIG, was skeptical. "I think we are moving toward an ad-free world," he said. "If AT&T buying Time Warner will allow it to deliver the right ad to the right person and cut the ad load … that would be great. But the greatest advancement the TV industry has made in advertising has been to disable fast forwarding." Limited reach is only one reason addressable TV hasn't taken off. There's also a premium in cost and effort, on all sides, to get deals done. If Turner sold addressable inventory in TBS's "Full Fontal With Samantha Bee," it would come out of the ratings points it could deliver to traditional advertisers. Turner would also need to line up several advertisers to split one slot, or find one advertiser with different creative executions to run depending on the home. Finding a multi-brand advertiser such as Procter & Gamble might be a relatively easy solution, but P&G has lately been saying that targeting on Facebook, at least, isn't worth the trouble and cost for most household brands. More intelligent ad buys may be the most immediate result, suggested Dave Morgan, CEO and founder at Simulmedia, a targeted TV specialist. "The notion that we will see addressable TV at massive scale just because of this deal I don't buy into," he said. "But I think this merger will be a catalyst for more data-driven TV advertising."
