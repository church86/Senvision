Scanzoni, a tough negotiator, has for years helped set the tone and pace of a crucial market for the media sector, one in which $8 billion to $9 billion is traded on broadcast primetime TV alone, with more committed to cable, syndicated and Spanish-language television. After serving since 2005 as chief investment officer for the North American operations of GroupM, the large media-buying operation that is part of ad-holding giant WPP, Scanzoni is moving to a new role – and the shift is indicative of a transformation of how Madison Avenue is buying commercial inventory across all media. GroupM, which works for advertisers including Unilever and American Express, on Monday named Lyle Schwartz to the role of president of investment, meaning he will oversee how advertiser dollars are allocated across TV, print, radio, digital, and local media, as well as the burgeoning swell of analytic tools advertisers are tapping to help them determine their allocations. He will report to Brian Lesser, the chief executive of GroupM North America. Schwartz will have a good deal of influence over how some $30 billion worth of advertising is spent across the U.S. and Canada. “This is the first time someone with a research and analytics background has been named trading chief for a major media investment group,” said Lesser, in a prepared statement. “This decision underscores our belief that data and insights are fundamental to the success of the entire business.” Related When Rino Scanzoni Speaks, TV Networks Tend to Listen Advertisers of all stripes are relying more strongly on data about consumer behavior and buying to help them determine where to place their commercials. At a time when media use has become increasingly splintered, big-spending marketers like Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola can no longer just follow what was standard practice three decades ago and buy a few ads in national newspapers and major magazines while spraying TV ads across the broadcast networks. Advertising in the digital era means figuring out where the consumers most likely to buy, say, a luxury car or a can of diet root beer are most likely to lie in wait, and then tailoring commercials expressly for those particular environments. Viacom, Comcast’s NBCU and Time Warner’s Turner are among the big companies crafting their own data brews to lure sponsors to their fold. These data products can include everything from set-top box viewer behavior measures to consumer patterns discovered by examining loyalty cards and programs affiliated with drug stores and supermarkets. Some media companies are trying to set up deals based on these data agreements rather than ones based on Nielsen, the gold standard of an era when couch potatoes still stared at a TV screen in their living rooms. Schwartz and Scanzoni have worked together for years, and were pivotal figures in discussions that in 2007 led to the use of so-called “commercial ratings,” or audience measures that looked at how many TV viewers watched commercial breaks, not the TV shows they interrupted, to determine how much media companies ought to be paid. The new system was created in the wake of the rise of digital video recorders, which allowed viewers to fast forward past commercials. Schwartz has more than 30 years of experience at WPP, including roles at the ad agency once known as Young & Rubicam before it was acquired by the holding company in 2000. Related Viacom Bets on Big Data to Boost Its Revenues Scanzoni will supervise both Modi Media, a unit that looks at future TV models in the U.S. and Midas Exchange, a barter division that deals with the trade of tangible assets in exchange for advertising inventory. He will be executive chairman and chief executive of both units. GroupM said Scanzoni would “continue to build and expand new trading products as well as contribute to market strategy for the group.” His role in the media industry played out largely behind the scenes, but he has been instrumental in how advertisers choose to support TV for decades. Top executives and Wall Streeters often sought his counsel on ad-spending patterns and the direction of the economy. Speculation that GroupM might find a successor for him has wafted for the past few years. It’s well known that the executive prefers to focus on strategy, rather than on incessant staff meeting and intense client hand-holding, and he has at times plotted strategy from a house in Utah. Schwartz will work alongside Phil Cowdell,who was named GroupM’s president of platform services in North America. This new unit will deal with emerging ad markets, including programmatic, search marketing, social media, digital operations and digital analytics.  For the past two years, Cowdell served as the North American CEO of MediaCom,a GroupM unit where he has been instrumental in helping the agency win more than $1.5 billion in new business from companies including Anheuser-Busch InBev, Bayer, Sony Playstation and Mars.       i Filed Under: GroupM Rino Scanzoni Tv Advertising Tv Upfront Market Upfront 2016 Want to read more articles like this one?

Too Faced, which is expected to top $270 million in net sales this year, will help Estee Lauder expand in e-commerce and specialty stores, according to a statement Monday. The purchase is expected to be completed next month. The deal, which would dwarf Estee Lauder’s previous acquisitions, extends a run of industry mergers this year. Coty Inc. acquired more than 40 of Procter & Gamble Co.’s beauty brands last month in a transaction worth $12.5 billion. And Revlon Inc. agreed to acquire Elizabeth Arden Inc. in June for about $419 million. Too Faced, started by Jerrod Blandino and Jeremy Johnson, would let Estee Lauder reach a younger shopper and will be complementary to MAC, the parent company’s biggest makeup brand. Too Faced, based in Los Angeles, has 7.3 million Instagram followers and sells makeup for the eyes, face and lips in quirky packaging. Its best-selling mascara is called “Better Than Sex.” “We like the acquisition,” Jason Gere, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., said in a report. “Estee Lauder has a demonstrated history of success in driving scale of smaller, high-growth brands on its global platform.” Other Acquisitions Estee Lauder, which also bought makeup brand Becca this month, could use a boost after delivering a disappointing forecast to investors. It plans to add its newly acquired brands into its 2017 guidance, which will be announced during its second-quarter earnings in February, Chief Financial Officer Tracey Travis said on a conference call Tuesday. The Too Faced acquisition will reduce earnings in 2017, but will improve them after that, she said. Estee Lauder, based in New York, suffered its worst stock rout in more than a year on Nov. 2 after saying that earnings would be $1.10 to $1.15 a share this quarter. Analysts had estimated $1.31 on average. Its shares are down 11 percent this year. Chief Executive Officer Fabrizio Freda said that declining traffic at mid-tier U.S. department stores contributed to the slowdown. That has increased the urgency of owning brands that sell via the internet and other channels -- Too Faced’s strength. The acquisition target has seen sales grow more than 70 percent this year and 60 percent on a compound annual basis over the past three years, and the company expects the growth rate to continue. Millennial Consumers The brand “strengthens our leadership in the fastest-growing product category in the global prestige beauty makeup,” Freda said on the conference call. “It increases our penetration with millennial and Gen Z consumers, who are socially connected beauty enthusiasts.” Too Faced, those costumers are mostly under 40, currently gets about 83 percent of its sales from North America. It will be expanded in the U.S. and internationally, as well as in travel retail globally, Freda said. Estee Lauder, which has made seven acquisitions since 2014, will continue to look for M&A opportunities, he said Tuesday. Cosmetics companies have been seeking new sales channels as the department-store makeup counter loses its allure. L’Oreal SA, for instance, agreed in July to spend $1.2 billion to buy IT Cosmetics. That business sells through QVC and the Shopping Channel, as well as retailers such as Ulta and Sephora. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Amazon Last October, New York-based digital agency Rain worked with Campbell's to find a new way to push out the CPG giant's library of recipes, creating one of the first branded "skills" for Amazon's voice-controlled Echo device, which helped consumers find dinner recipes on demand. While the agency expected a bit of a PR boost from the Campbell's work, voice and the so-called Internet of Things has actually become a big growth area for Rain over the past year, as more agencies look for ways to tap into emerging devices for brands. Shortly after creating the Campbell's skill, Rain became one of a handful of Amazon's go-to developers tasked with building "skills"—voice apps that let consumers ask questions to Amazon's AI platform named Alexa. Rain even opened up a small satellite office—albeit with one employee—in Seattle to be closer to Amazon's headquarters. "From an agency level, Amazon helps make some connections with clients," said Greg Hedges, director of strategy at Rain. "People will reach out to Amazon sometimes and then we'll get them to the right people." In the past year, Rain has signed 1-800-Flowers, P&G's Tide, Yahoo Fantasy Football and Liberty Mutual-owned Safeco as clients, helping to build branded skills that dole out information and entertainment to consumers. For Safeco, the agency built a glossary of insurance terms so that consumers can ask Alexa questions like, "What is umbrella insurance?" or "What does liability mean?" For 1-800-Flowers, users can automatically place flower orders to their friends or family members. In addition to building branded skills, Rain is also plugged into Amazon Voice Service, the arm of Amazon's business focused on building Alexa into other devices. As part of that, Rain recently built a smartphone app called Reverb that uses Amazon's API so that anyone can use Alexa—whether or not they have an Echo device. Here's how it works: People download the Reverb iOS or Android app (there's also a website) and log in with an Amazon account. From there, folks are prompted to press a finger on the screen to ask Alexa a question. Just like using Echo, Alexa reads the answer out loud and consumers can then have a back-and-forth conversation with her. For Rain, the app is a way for staffers to tweak and improve the user experience of branded skills when they aren't nearby to use an Echo. "We use it to test our skills," Hedges said. "We are always looking to be on top of moving technologies and make sure that we understand them—building this was part of understanding the platform." Going forward, Rain is looking for ways that marketers can use Reverb. In one scenario, the technology could be built into a branded app for Campbell's, to make it easier for consumers to access recipes without having to press a button. "We've already talked about that," said Hedges. "Amazon democratized the voice experience by opening the door [to voice] and we're helping to further that by opening the Alexa platform up." Hedges said that the agency is working on other ways to build on the initial success of the Campbell's skill, too. "We want to work [on] the ability not to just get the recipe but also extend that cooking experience into getting ingredients [or more information into] the steps." It's not the first time that Rain has hacked Echo. In May, Rain software engineer Octavio Menocal created a skill for playing a simple game of rock, paper scissors. Data informs Rain's investment in Echo. Hedges said that the agency builds Google Analytics into its skills to track stats like how long someone spends with the skill, when they use it, their ZIP code and what questions they ask. "In the Yahoo Fantasy Football app, I can ask for information about a player," Hedges said. "We're not only capturing the fact that someone asked about a player, we're actually capturing information about what specific player they asked for so that we can see which players are most popular." Rain is also keeping its eye on Google Home, the company's new home device that's potentially full of marketing data. In December, Google plans to open up its AI platform—dubbed Google Assistant—for marketers and developers to create similar experiences to Amazon Echo. "We feel like the process that we've honed is applicable to those—while we've built skills, what we've really been building in the end are these larger experiences and then executing them using Alexa," Hedges said.

Decker arrives at CP+B from Omnicom shopper marketing agency The Integer Group of Lakewood, Colorado. He spent over eight years there, most recently serving as VP of insight and strategy and leading planning on the Kellogg, PepsiCo, MillerCoors, and P&G accounts. Before that he spent two years as insights director with 72andSunny, handling strategy and research for various clients including Discovery, Nike, Quiksilver and Roxy.

Consulting firms came up with the highest percentage of offers while BFSI (Banking, Financial services and Insurance) sector proposed the highest stipend for the students at the Indian Institute of Management-Calcutta. Out of over 460 summer internship offers made on the campus, the consulting sector had the highest share of 24 per cent, followed by BFSI at 23 per cent. BFSI also offered the highest stipend for the season at Rs 4.5 lakh per month. Major recruiters in consulting were Mckinsey and Co, Bain & Co., the Boston Consulting Group, A.T. Kearney and Accenture Strategy, the latter being the largest recruiter in the consulting domain. The BFSI sector witnessed a surge in the number of banking sector firms and private recruiters participating in the placement process, with Goldman Sachs emerging the top recruiter in the category. FMCG and consumer product firms of the likes of HUL, P&G, ITC and L'Oreal hired in large numbers. Food and Beverages companies like PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, Mondelez and Nestle hired 19 per cent of the batch in sales and marketing roles as the summer placements for the class of 2018 successfully concluded last week. "A total of 14 per cent of the batch was hired for leadership roles in conglomerates like Tata Administrative Services, Aditya Birla Group, Mahindra & Mahindra and others. Aditya Birla Group stayed on top as the largest and most consistent recruiter in this domain with the highest number of offers," the IIM said in a statement.

Stock markets initially took fright, but swiftly bounced back following Trump's victory speech, which was uncharacteristically measured and gracious. The opinion polls once again got it wrong, as did various investment strategist and financial commentators, who predicted a heavy short-term sell-off due to the various uncertainties associated with a Trump presidency. Over the longer term these uncertainties may well come back to haunt financial markets and inflict damage on investors' portfolios. Many of these risks, however, are already well documented, which in turns gives savvy investors the opportunity to Trump-proof their investments. TRUMP WIN COULD BE GAME-CHANGER FOR BONDS Trump's victory could completely change the investment landscape. The president elect has pledged to cut taxes and increase infrastructure spending on America's ageing roads, bridges, power grids and airports. In turn, this is expected to boost company earnings and consumer spending, but ultimately it will widen the US public sector deficit in the years to come, causing inflation to rise and monetary policy to tighten. To add weight to this argument, Trump has in the past criticised the Federal Reserve for keeping interest rates low, describing the move as creating a 'false economy'.  '[Trump's proposals] will result in higher bond yields and a steeper yield curve,' notes Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. Paolini adds that rising inflation and a wider deficit could also spell an end to dollar strength, which according to Pictet's models is already some 20 per cent overvalued on a trade-weighted basis. High-quality bonds with low yields, such as government bonds, will suffer from higher rates and higher inflation. But as Money Observer noted last month, there are various bond inflation insurance policies, including index-linked bond funds or exchanged traded funds. One option, highlight by Psgima's Tom Becket, is the Fidelity Index-Linked Bond fund. Another way to mitigate risk is to consider bond funds that hold bonds with short lifespans - in other words, that are a couple of years away from maturity. Indeed, some bond fund managers, including James Foster at Artemis, have moved to 'short' government bonds in anticipation that the 35-year bond bull market is coming to an end. Investment grade and high yield bonds are better placed to ride the storm. Eoin Walsh, co-manager of the TwentyFour Dynamic Bond fund, makes the point that 'if you own yield in this environment, you should probably hang on to it'. This argument, however, probably doesn't extend to the part of the bond market that offers the highest yields of all - emerging market debt - due to Trump's protectionist agenda. The president-elect has pledged to rip up longstanding trade agreements and impose tariffs on imports. Jim Cielinski, global head of fixed income at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, notes: 'Trump's victory is most worrisome for this asset class. Aside from the obvious risk to the close trading partners of Latin America, and Mexico in particular, China is also a concern. 'Much depends on trade policy, as many emerging market countries are heavily export dependent to America. Do not expect clarity for several more months.' Foster adds that one unknown element is the Chinese reaction to being called 'currency manipulators' by Trump. 'The risk is that they respond by selling their substantial holdings of Treasuries. Who knows, but that clearly would be very damaging for bond yields,' says Foster. FOR EQUITIES A trade war between America and China cannot be ruled out, and under this scenario the US economy could be knocked off course. Certain stocks would also be hit. Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management says potential losers are US multinationals with sales exposure to the Asia Pacific region, including Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson and Nike. Marc Pullen, senior equity analyst at the firm, adds that many companies may also lose out, including those that source parts or even their entire products from China, such as Apple. 'So even those US companies with relatively few sales to China could suffer in terms of profit margins,' says Pullen. The emerging market regions, however, could end up being among the biggest equity market losers. That's a point made by Neil Woodford, who manages the CF Woodford Equity Income fund; he says he expects globalisation to come under the spotlight under a Trump administration, and as a result investors should 'expect a greater focus on domestic political priorities at the expense of free trade and globalisation'. Consumer goods giants, the so-called bond proxies, the likes of Unilever and Diageo, are also tipped to be among the losers, due to the expectation that both interest rates and bond yields will rise. The widely held view is that when the interest rate cycle turns and assets other than equities start to look attractive again, bond proxies will be ditched and their share prices will fall. Sarasin & Partners' Guy Monson says that he now prefers 'local franchises over internationally focused businesses'. Among the winners Monson expects a further recovery in high quality US banks and a sharp recovery in some of the best global pharmaceutical franchises, which had sold off in an anticipation of a Hilary Clinton victory. HOW TO TWEAK YOUR FUND CHOICE There will also be fund winners and losers, and it may pay fund investors to switch to a holding more likely to benefit under Trump's presidency. Jason Hollands, of adviser Tilney Bestinvest, tipped First State Global Listed Infrastructure, Axa Framlington Health and Investec Enhanced Natural Resources. The latter fund, Hollands says, 'could capitalise on demand for raw materials that arises from increased infrastructure spend, but it is important to bear in mind that increase US demand needs to be weighed against a slowdown in demand from China.' But at uncertain times it ultimately pays in the long run to adopt a diversified approach and have a segment of your portfolio in safe havens, such as gold or funds that invest in an extremely cautious manner. Options include Personal Assets and RIT Capital Partners, with the latter being one of Money Observer's Rated Funds. Patrick Gordon, a senior market strategist at Killik, says: 'As with Brexit, it is times like these where diversification is particularly important. It remains difficult to call currency moves and short-term asset price swings, but a diversified portfolio, both by asset class and geography, should help to cushion the impact of heightened volatility.'

It also announced there would be no Chrome ad blocker. Actively-used browsers aren't the same as active users, given that many users rely on Chrome on multiple devices, indeed one of the benefits of using Chrome is that it can easily sync between your devices. But however and wherever you look you'll quickly come to the same conclusion - Chrome has become the ubiquitous and dominant browser. On the desktop it has taken share from Microsoft's Internet Explorer and ensured that Edge has a failed to be adopted despite the efforts made in Windows 10. The fact Chrome is pre-installed on every phone running Google's version of Android certainly gives it a head start in the mobile arena and it also has a healthy share of iOS devices. Here's the latest position from StatCounter across PCs, mobile devices and consoles, showing that Chrome has a 51.53% share of the world-wide market   From NetMarketShare, the latest browser stats for smartphones, tablets and consoles are displayed in this pie chart which shows Chrome's share is 54.30%, with Safari having the only other significant slice (25.66%)   Turning attention to the desktop distribution, Chrome has almost the same proportion (54.41%) and it is Internet Explorer, which is the default browser for Windows 7, the dominant desktop OS that is is second place with 25.48%   NetMarketShare's trend chart over the last 12 months shows clearly how Chrome has increased its dominance at the expense of Internet Explorer: We used to comment on how Firebox was doing - but even though it has rallied a little from its low in August it does seem to have become a lost cause. It will be interesting to see if Edge, which is increasing its tiny share ever edges Firefox out of its third rank position. Meanwhile back at the Chrome Dev Summit, Darin Fisher, vice president of Chrome engineering, told delegates that Google will not be building an ad-blocking feature into Chrome, explaining that it's better to change the behavior of adds rather than block them altogether, a viewpoint undoubtedly motivated by the fact that Google makes a lot of revenue from advertising. Fisher said:  "We feel like there are a lot of challenges in advertising. There are a lot of wrong ways. However, if publishers and advertisers do ads the right way, it can be great for the users and for the ecosystem." Admitting that a lot of advertising hurts engagement by actually deterring people from using websites he referred to a recent initiative, the Coalition for Better Ads that Google has helped to found along with publishers like Facebook, News Corp. and The Washington Post, advertisers like Unilever and Proctor & Gamble, and industry groups like the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) and the Association of National Advertisers (ANA). Fisher also outlined Google's plans to to have Chrome support progressive web apps (PWAs) that deliver a mobile app-like experience within browsers:   "It's expensive to get people to install an app ... but progressive web apps arrive fast through the browser to keep visitors happy, then download extra abilities silently in the background. For website developers there's really no fundamental limit to the kinds of experiences you can create."

Illustration: Jayachandran/Mint When I first met Suketu Talekar in Pune, back in 2009, Brewcrafts Microbrewing Pvt. Ltd, which produces Doolally craft beers, was still making test batches of ales and ciders. As I watched Talekar, then 32, and German head brewer and co-founder Oliver Schauf, whom he met online when he was looking for a partner, haul sacks of malt and hops from the storage room to the brewery, they had to explain to me the basics of how a beer is made. “Beer is, essentially, the shit and piss of yeast,” Talekar, Doolally’s co-founder, had said, guffawing. They had to carefully list the differences between an industrial beer and a craft one, and why the latter was more desirable. As India’s first microbrewery, Doolally’s principal challenge then was simply letting consumers know there was more to beer than Kingfisher and Foster’s. Just seven years later, India has more than 30 microbreweries. If you’re anywhere in Bengaluru, Pune, Gurgaon or Mumbai, you’re not far from a pub that will serve you a craft beer on tap. Even your local wine shop may have bottles of craft beer made by an Indian company. Talekar, who is in charge of Doolally’s marketing and sales—Schauf handles the making of the beer—is neither surprised, nor overly excited, about the rapid growth of a market he helped open up. “If you make a good beer, consumers will love it. That was always a no-brainer for me,” he says. We are sitting at the Doolally Taproom in Bandra, Mumbai, one of three such outlets in the city. The company, which began selling its beers at The Corinthians Resort & Club in Pune in 2009, brought its brews to Mumbai in 2015. The Bandra Taproom, wholly owned and run by Doolally, was their first outlet, and since then, two more have opened, one in Andheri and another at Kemps Corner. These restaurants are perpetually filled with increasingly knowledgeable beer drinkers who don’t even need the menu, let alone an explanation of what craft beer is, to place their order. But the education process has not been completed, says Talekar. “We have moved a long way from walking into a bar and asking just for ‘a beer’. Now, we walk into a bar and ask for a brand and a style—a Gateway Doppelganger or an Independence IPA (India Pale Ale),” he says. “Customers know there are possibilities of beer beyond Kingfisher and Foster’s. But really understanding what those possibilities are, that is an ongoing process.” "Among light, session beers, Talekar’s favourite styles are Gose, a salty, tarty German beer; Saison, which is easy to drink; the English bitter; and the English brown ale, particularly Hobgoblin, made by the Wychwood Brewery Company. Among challenging styles, he loves Indian Pale Ales, Belgian Tripels and Porters."- As that process continues, Talekar expects the industry to grow to a size that will dwarf what is now being heralded as a craft-beer boom. The US has seen the number of microbreweries reach nearly 5,000, even though the first one opened only in the late 1970s, he says. At this early stage in India, he sees other microbreweries more as allies than as competitors. “More players means more perspective on the product. It means more experimentation. It means consumers holding brewers to a higher standard, which means improvement on the product.” And he is impressed with the quality of entrepreneurs entering the craft beer industry, something he thinks will be critical to the pace it grows at. “People are making conservative estimates about the market for craft beer because they are underestimating the quality of the entrepreneurs entering this market. I believe there is a qualitative difference between the early bunch of winemakers and the early bunch of craft-beer makers. I will put my money behind a statement that in five years, craft beer will be 2x or 3x bigger than the wine industry. Which would mean that in 10 years, we would have done what the wine guys haven’t managed to do in 25 years. And that’s because of the quality of the entrepreneurs.” One of the stumbling blocks for the craft-beer industry has been the red tape one has to navigate to begin making craft beer and, then, package it in a way that is profitable. A number of breweries have complained that without being allowed to bottle their beers, they are left with too few revenue streams to break even. Talekar thinks the extent of these problems is overstated. Doolally has joined hands with a few other breweries to form the Maharashtra Craft Brewers Association, and they are seeking, among other things, permission from the excise department to sell beer in growlers (air-tight jugs used to store beer) at brewpubs. “It will be like parcelling beer, like you parcel food at a restaurant,” Talekar explains. Someday, he would also like to see Doolally beers sitting in bottles in stores. But at the moment he is not fixated on finding new ways to package and sell his beer. Rather, his days are spent managing Doolally’s Taprooms and ensuring that he “wins with every consumer who walks in”. Doolally’s Taprooms have become popular in Mumbai as places for relaxed get-togethers. They are brightly lit, unlike other pubs; the music is soft, allowing conversation; and the walls are lined with shelves full of books and board games, suggesting this is a place you will not be hurried in. Talekar understands that the context in which he sells his beer is as important as the product. “We believe that people don’t come here to eat and drink. They come here for something else. They come here to spend time with friends, someone they love or their colleagues. It’s like an extension of their living rooms.” Born in Gujarat’s Bhavnagar and schooled in Nashik, Talekar did a course in production engineering from the Jawaharlal Nehru College in Aurangabad. After a stint with his father’s company, which did sales and after-sales service of diesel engines, Talekar completed his master’s in business administration from the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, in 2004. He then worked as an assistant brand manager with Procter & Gamble in Singapore. He had always been a beer drinker, but had never drunk truly good beer until he began frequenting a brewpub named Brewerkz there. He returned to India a year later with the idea of bringing good beer to his home country. His conservative family wasn’t too happy; they didn’t think “decent” people should be dealing in liquor. After a decade-long journey with BrewCrafts Microbrewing/Doolally, Talekar is doing things he had never imagined he would. Such as managing a pub. “We only began running our first 18 months ago, and now we have three, without raising any money. What I’ve learnt in this time is that there is no greater marketing tool than experiential retail. You can actually moderate how a person feels. That’s why every Apple store is worth a hundred million dollars that Microsoft spends on advertising.” Doolally’s beer sales have grown 400% since 2014 and their total revenue has increased by 1,000% in the same period. They’ve also added to their staff, currently at around 180, and have moved from working out of the Taprooms to an office in Santacruz. With this pace of growth, employees come to work every day knowing they are going to have to face new challenges, which is why Talekar sees his role as that of a cheerleader. “I believe in letting people be. I think that if you recruit right, then your job is to create conditions that will let people succeed and give them the leeway to make decisions and mistakes too. It’s natural when you are doing so many new things for morale to dip at times. My job is to get everyone excited about the big picture.” Dustin Silgardo Topics: Suketu TalekarDoolally craft beersMicrobreweriesPuneOliver Schauf More from this Section How Walnut mobile app can help you find an ATM that is active App Radar: Must-have new apps and games for Android and iOS Review: Blueair Blue Pure 211 is a breath of fresh air Best ways to filter the bad air Cut your diabetes risk Editor's Picks The cash withdrawal, currency exchange challenge at rural bank branches Subbarao warns RBI against taking unclaimed notes as profit Demonetization to help check tax evasion through penny stocks The economics of currency reform Donald Trump’s threat to Indian IT is all bluster First Published: Fri, Nov 11 2016. 12 51 PM IST Latest News Helping consumers win the telecom wars Thailand’s lessons for the healthcare system Donald Trump brings uncertainties for India Editor's Picks The cash withdrawal, currency exchange challenge at rural bank branches Subbarao warns RBI against taking unclaimed notes as profit Demonetization to help check tax evasion through penny stocks Latest News Helping consumers win the telecom wars Thailand’s lessons for the healthcare system Donald Trump brings uncertainties for India The economics of currency reform The two-step Trump dance Mint On Sunday The priceless legacy of P.L.

Nearly 300 global senior executives across diverse sectors are convening today through Nov 16th to unveil cutting-edge corporate practices that measure and quantify environmental and social impacts and tie them to financial and business value. Conversations are focusing on Corporate Strategy & Operations, Customer Insights and Engagement, Investor Trends & Relations, as well as Supply Chain Impact & Management. New Metrics ’16 hosts more than 100 influential speakers sharing case studies and achievements of organizations succeeding in utilizing novel, diverse performance methodologies and metrics to assess the business risk, benefit and ROI of sustainability. This year, many of the sessions and workshops led by these speakers are eligible for Continuing Professional Education (CPE) credit for licensed CPAs. Through a new partnership with the Rhode Island Society of CPAs (RISCPA), Certified Public Accountants can earn total of 22 CPEs over the 3 day period. Compelling corporate initiatives and leading-edge business performance metrics presented at New Metrics ‘16 include: Adam Elman, Global Head of Delivery – Plan A & Sustainable Business at Marks and Spencer, shares how one of the world’s leading retailers was able to quantify the social and environmental impacts of increasing the sustainability attributes of their products. Jocelyn Cascio, Supply Chain Sustainability Sr. Manager at Intel, reveals how the tech giant improves sustainability in its supply chain and how it assesses the ROI of such efforts. Bob Willard, renowned author of Sustainability Advantage, reveals and explains key insights from his new e-book about evaluating, justifying and building business cases around corporate sustainability initiatives. Rasmus Skov, Head of Sustainability Performance at DONG Energy, discusses what kinds of non-financial data the energy company leveraged to demonstrate to shareholders and other stakeholders the value gained by transitioning from a coal-intensive utility to a market leader in offshore wind energy. Rob Michalak, Global Director of Social Mission at Ben & Jerry’s, and Mark McElroy, co-author of The Multicapital Scorecard™, update the community on lessons learned from a Ben and Jerry’s attempt to test a pilot version of the Scorecard, a reporting mechanism that examines organizational performance in all its dimensions, including social, economic and environmental. Michelle Lapinski, on the Steering Group for the Natural Capital Coalition, introduces the Natural Capital Protocol, a new, comprehensive framework launched in July 2016 to help businesses in any sector better understand and manage natural capital. Martin Rich, Chair & Co-founder of the Future-Fit Foundation, and Michael Jantzi, CEO of Sustainalytics, unveil a new vision for equipping mainstream investors with the tools they need to assess the sustainability of current and prospective investment targets.     “Sustainable Brands recognized and first convened a group of innovative business leaders 5 years ago at our first New Metrics event to spur aggressive action toward translating previously ignored environmental and social impacts into corporate financial performance indicators,” states KoAnn Vikoren Skrzyniarz, Founder and CEO of Sustainable Brands. “We have since opened critical insight into key business metrics that are informing next generation goals and just beginning to tap the business opportunity for sustainability-driven innovation in the 21st century.” Nearly 300 senior sustainability and financial executives from leading companies such as Coca-Cola, Amazon.com, BASF, adidas group, Burt’s Bees, CVS Health, Dell, Etsy, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, Pepsico, Target and UPS are attending this week at the Royal Sonesta Boston in Cambridge, MA.

MUMBAI: The consulting share accounted for the largest chunk of summer internships offers, with nearly 24 per cent of the 460-plus offers. Major recruiters in consulting were McKinsey & Co, Bain & Co, Boston Consulting Group, A.T. Kearney and Accenture Strategy, the latter being the largest recruiter in the consulting domain. Finance continued to be one of the most sought-after domains among students with 23 per cent of the batch securing internships in the BFSI sector. The sector witnessed a surge in the number of banking sector firms and private recruiters participating in the placement process with Goldman Sachs being the top recruiter in the category. FMCG, consumer product and F&B companies including HUL, P&G, ITC, L’Oreal, J&J, PepsiCo., Coca Cola, Mondelez and Nestle hired 19 per cent of the batch in sales & marketing roles 14 per cent of the batch was hired for leadership roles in conglomerates such as Tata Administrative Services, Aditya Birla Group, Mahindra & Mahindra and others.

Conducted by Pampers in association with AC Nielsen, the survey -- which had a sample size of 432 parents (216 mothers) of children up to three years of age in Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata -- highlights how the involvement of both the mother and the father is extremely crucial for the cognitive, social as well as the emotional development of the baby. It is conducted in correspondence with Pampers' latest campaign 'It Takes Two' (#ItTakes2) that talks about the importance of both mother and father's involvement in wholesome development of the baby. The results of the survey indicate that 97 per cent of the mothers said it takes two to raise a happy and healthy baby, and 90 per cent of the women surveyed said they want their husbands to be more involved in baby care. As many as 88 per cent of the mothers agreed that their husbands hesitate to change diapers. Among the men, 88 per cent of them said baby chores primarily need only the mother's involvement. Commenting on the survey, a P&G Spokesperson said: "The survey brings forth the fact that a happy, healthy baby needs active participation from both mom and dad, right from Day one. Paediatricians and child psychologists also agree that involvement of the mother as well as the father towards baby care has a direct correlation towards better cognitive and social development of the baby. "The results thus pose a very interesting question to all the young parents out there, If #ItTakes2 to make a baby, shouldn't It Take 2 to raise a baby?" --IANS rb/dg SEARCH About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2016.

Cosmetics, books, baby goods, electronics, pharmaceutical products, fresh produce, clothing and mobile phones all recorded huge sales during this year’s event, according to data released by Alibaba, whose main shopping platforms are Taobao Marketplace, TMall, and AliExpress. But in terms of the top individual brands, a broad representation from various categories of retailers stole the show. Japanese clothing brand Uniqlo, home appliance major Midea, mobile handsets brand Honor and Guangdong-based furniture maker Linsy were among the most popular sellers with sales each surpassing 100 million yuan within the first half hour of the shopping event. FMCG spans everything from infant formula to soft drinks and beauty products, and China’s annual online spending volume last year shot up to US$25.3 billion from US$1.4 billion in 2010, according to market researcher Euromonitor International. As Chinese urban dwellers rely more on e-commerce for their daily necessities to save time and money, online sales of packaged foods, alcoholic drinks and personal care products are expected to record exponential growth in the years to come, a recent survey by London-based consultancy OC&C found. The report showed while large grocery sales in China still have lower online penetration than the other categories, as well as tech-savvy millennials, those aged between 30 and 50 said they would be opting to buy daily necessities online in the coming six months. “The growing middle classes want to save money on everyday consumables so they can use these savings towards a better lifestyle including for dining out or buying international fashion brands,” said Jack Chuang, Partner, Greater China, OC&C Strategy Consultant. “As their appetite for premium and healthy products rises, consumers are also seeking to order imported foods and drinks online if they can’t find them in local hypermarkets or corner stores. That has prompted Alibaba to put Borges olive cooking oil from Spain, Ocean Spray raisins from US, and Haribo gummy candy from Germany – essentially the Western snacks barely seen across Chinese urban neighbourhoods – on sale in its online supermarket. “Chinese consumers are eager to try something new, and they always favour brands they consider more reliable,” said Joerg Wolle, CEO of Swiss market expansion giant DKSH Holding which recently purchased a major stake in eSweets, a Shanghai-based distributor of high-end consumer goods such as Lindt chocolate and Illy Coffee. The grocery market space, from soy sauce to shampoo, is becoming an emerging billion dollar battleground for Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and its chief rival JD.com as they hunt for new revenue growth in China. The war is likely to be costly and any victory will be hard fought, with rock bottom prices no longer the only key to success in e-commerce. Rather, it will be the quality of goods that entice China’s rising middle classes who are thirsty for Fiji water and hungry for European biscuits. It will also bring about change to the shopping habits of millions of Chinese, most of whom are accustomed to ordering clothes and home electronics online, but would still walk to a convenience store or supermarket for their daily necessities. The war escalated in the three weeks leading up to Alibaba’s November 11 Singles’ Day online shopping extravaganza when Wal-Mart Stores joined with JD.com to set up a Beijing online store to deliver imported goods to Chinese shoppers “within hours”. On the same day in Hong Kong, Alibaba spotlighted its alliance with giant US warehouse retailer Costco Wholesale, and other grocery brands like Procter & Gamble, as part of its Singles’ Day promotions that included coupons, discounts and offering products not yet available in China. The pacts with Western consumer multinationals were part of a multibillion dollar campaign rolled out by Alibaba, owner of the South China Morning Post, as it vowed to outspend its rivals to gain an upper hand in the unfolding grocery war. “While [JD.com] is talking about US$1 billion investments, we are willing to invest multi-times that number because this is a category we think we should be in as it has great potential,” Alibaba’s chief financial officer Maggie Wu said in a call with analysts in August. In the second quarter earnings result, Alibaba singled out its Tmall online supermarket as a business that scored a stellar “triple digit sales volume growth”. JD’s grocery revenue soared 70 per cent over the first quarter of the year, while Alibaba’s online supermarket, currently the largest nationwide, more than tripled its sales for the same period. “Without question, fast-moving consumer goods are where Alibaba and JD.com’s future growth lies, with home appliances and clothing e-commerce in China approaching saturation,”said Hu Chuncai, Shanghai-based general manager with retail management consultancy Shangyi Consulting. A price war between the two titans have also erupted, and intensified. In early September, Alibaba’s Tmall Supermarket spent an estimated 180 million yuan on offering 50 per cent discounts in time sensitive deals in Beijing and Shanghai, firing back at similar sales promotions at the grocery division of JD.com, with the Beijing-based e-commerce firm promising to make its online grocery store “second to none” within three years. “But the chance is slim for JD to live up to that pledge, given that Alibaba has already gained a position of dominance particularly in southwest and northwest China,” said Shangyi Consulting’s Hu. The OC&C survey of 4,600 Chinese urbanites found that Alibaba’s Tmall and sister e-commerce site Taobao achieved the highest brand awareness and shopper penetration across major grocery categories, from infant formula to alcoholics drinks. But China’s online grocery market is also more fragmented, as Alibaba commands a 52 per cent market share versus a 70 per cent it controls of the overall online retail landscape in the country, according to OC&C. Alibaba’s chief executive Zhang Yong noted in a recent interview that winning consumers and success in China’s online grocery market also called for a “full embracing of offline channels”. “A partnership with bricks-and-mortar retailers will allow shoppers to place orders online and collect items in person at a store nearby, which will serve as part of the grocery delivery network,”said Hu, Driving down logistics costs would considerably fatten profit margins of grocery e-commerce, where package shipping can be more “costly” compared with bigger ticket items such as apparel and home appliances. While JD tries to utilise Wal Mart’s extensive distribution channels across cities as it reinforces its cooperation with the US supermarket giant, Alibaba’s logistics affiliate Cainiao managed to reduce shopping time by launching grocery delivery centres across China’s most populous cities. In June, Alibaba invested 5 billion yuan in a partnership with white goods retailer Suning Commerce Group, linking its online shopping platforms to the latter’s over 1,600 outlets 5,500 after-sales service points in China. Although e-commerce powerhouses are now making an all-out effort to make online purchases of toothpastes and potato chips easier than ever, patience is needed for Chinese consumers to really overhaul their grocery shopping patterns, experts reckon. “It will take time, probably a few years,”said OC&C’s Chuang, “and the shift will be on a gradual basis.” Additional reporting by Eric Ng This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: FMCG goods lead shopping surge of Chinese consumers   Most Popular Viewed 1 Trump’s America: the good, the bad and the ugly 2 RIP: Hong Kong’s shopping industry, as e-retailers tighten their grip 3 Modi’s key aide blames poor planning for India’s currency crisis 4 Don’t overestimate Hong Kong’s importance on Beijing’s legislative and governing agenda 5 For couriers living in fear of Singles’ Day, the week after is a bonanza of extra pay Shared 1 Don’t overestimate Hong Kong’s importance on Beijing’s legislative and governing agenda 2 Trump’s America: the good, the bad and the ugly 3 RIP: Hong Kong’s shopping industry, as e-retailers tighten their grip 4 Modi’s key aide blames poor planning for India’s currency crisis 5 Alibaba bets big on cloud expansion to drive global growth Commented 1 Beijing’s top man in Hong Kong accuses Legco localists of treating community like ‘idiots’ 2 China’s first female pilot of J-10 fighter jets dies in an air accident 3 Trump’s America and Hong Kong’s oath taking crisis: how they are linked 4 Walking a mile in Beijing’s shoes could serve Hong Kong politicians well in future 5 Hong Kong woman latest victim of online love scam after losing HK$880,000 to ‘British lover’ Promotions Register for a free copy of XXIV 2017 now Register for a free copy of Home Essentials 2017 now       You may also like China Pacific Rim nations urged to revise TPP without US before Trump cuts trade ties 12 Nov 2016 - 12:29am 15 Mirror mirror on the wall: Talking mirrors in bathrooms of the future tailor made for media consumption In partnership with: HKT PREMIER Society Why China’s rise means Hong Kong stars like Jackie Chan will be the last of their kind 13 Nov 2016 - 7:23pm 14 Northern wonder: explore Ha Long Bay’s natural beauty, within easy reach from Hanoi Presented by Go Asia-Vietnam Hong Kong Despite fears, new air traffic control system to be launched at Hong Kong airport on Monday 11 Nov 2016 - 11:26pm 3 Hong Kong Did CY Leung mess up his own oath?
