Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Oct 14, 2016 at 3:23PM Image source: Getty Images. Thanks to slight differences in the way it tracks its fiscal year, Unilever (NYSE:UL) usually posts quarterly earnings results a few days ahead of Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), its consumer goods rival. That calendar quirk lets P&G investors get an early look at what they can expect to hear from their own management team about the prevailing industry trends. Unilever this week announced steady sales growth and affirmed its full-year outlook, but there were a few worrying points that suggest P&G might have downbeat news for shareholders when it posts its results on Oct. 25. Volume decline Unilever's organic growth pace fell to 3% from the 5% it enjoyed in each of the prior three quarters. That's not a problem by itself, since the gains were within management's forecast range, and Unilever still believes it will grow at a 4% pace this year. Image source: Unilever investor presentation. Looking deeper into the results reveals a major red flag, though. Unilever's growth came completely from price increases, and organic sales volumes declined overall. UL, like P&G, aims to produce market-beating sales growth that's driven mainly by volume gains. After all, price hikes can't produce consistent, long-run expansion. But the company came up short of that goal in a rare miss this quarter. The biggest bright spot in P&G's last quarterly report was its return to volume growth after more than a year of declines. That rebound helped produce an encouraging sales bounce and is also key to executives' goal of delivering a growth uptick for the full year. That's why a volume drop, if it hits Procter & Gamble, too, might force P&G to lower its outlook later this month. Industry struggles Unilever had nothing but negative comments about the state of consumer goods industry. "Demand remained weak," the company said in a press release, as growth "slowed further."  Management went into more detail in an investor presentation, citing falling consumer confidence, rising commodity costs, and volatile currency exchange rates. Image source: Unilever investor presentation. These are the same factors P&G has been struggling against for a few years now, so the company likely included them in their sales growth outlook for fiscal 2017. Still, P&G might have hoped for at least a flat overall market -- not one that's shrinking. It wasn't all bad news for P&G on this score, though, as Unilever posted a broad uptick in the key U.S. market, which suggests that geography is holding steady even as other areas of the world are slowing. P&G gets a larger chunk of its profits from developed economics like the U.S., so a strong performance there might be good enough to offset weakness in regions like Latin America and Asia. Can P&G surprise investors? P&G and Unilever compete in many of the same product categories and markets. But the overlap doesn't mean that lower results for one company translate into market share gains by the other. Instead, it's much more likely that the challenging selling conditions Unilever is reporting will also be cited by P&G later this month as drivers behind its own low-growth results. P&G shareholders have some encouraging news to look forward to when hearing from management in the next quarterly release, including updates on the company's ramped-up cash return plans and improved marketing spending. They aren't likely to see evidence of strong overall sales volume growth, though, or of an upturn in the broader industry. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Oct 13, 2016 at 8:52PM Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) held its annual shareholders meeting this week at a time when investors are gaining optimism that a business turnaround is about to take hold. The stock is up 20% in the last 12 months as P&G moves into what executives predict will be a year of accelerating growth for the consumer goods titan. Here are the key points management made in its presentation for investors. Image source: Getty. 1. Momentum Image source: P&G investor presentation. P&G is entering the new fiscal year with the wind at its back. Organic sales growth weighed in at 2% last quarter, compared to 1% for the full year. The bad news is that this growth pace still trailed rivals, meaning its market share struggles aren't over. However, its latest gains were driven by volume growth, not just higher prices, which suggests the company has a good shot at finally posting that sales rebound investors have been waiting for. 2. Advertising Image source: P&G investor presentation. P&G is seeing success from its ramped-up spending on advertising. In fact, executives credit a boost in marketing as one of the key factors behind the latest growth uptick. The company has to balance these costs against their potential to accelerate sales growth, though. Core profitability fell by almost 2 percentage points last quarter thanks mainly to the media spending increase. But P&G sees this trade-off as a profitable one over the long term, so the company plans to hike its marketing investments this year despite the fact that it has a much smaller portfolio. 3. Trial products Image source: P&G investor presentation. The marketing budget isn't limited to just TV and online advertising -- it also includes P&G's massive sampling program. Executives are planning to put trials of its new laundry detergent products into 30 million homes this fiscal year, up from 17 million in fiscal 2016. The company has found early success on this score in both its Gillette razors and Pampers diapers franchises by covering a whopping 80% and 70% of its target demographic, respectively. P&G is confident that many of these sampling users will convert into loyal fans of the brand. 4. Cost savings Image source: P&G investor presentation. Management has blown past its original target for cutting costs by $1.2 billion per year, with savings instead averaging $1.4 billion over the past five years. The plan ahead calls for doubling down on these productivity initiatives so P&G saves as much as $2 billion per year over the next five fiscal years, for a total savings of $10 billion by 2021. If it hits these goals, the company should have plenty of funds to direct toward innovation research and marketing budgets while also sending a huge pile of cash back to shareholders, mostly in the form of stock repurchases. 5. Big-picture goals TSR = Total shareholder return. Image source: P&G investor presentation. P&G's overarching operating goal has three parts. Executives aim to grow faster than the market while boosting profitability and producing ever-increasing cash flow. The company made significant progress in the latter two metrics last year, but it fell behind in the hardest, but most important one: organic sales growth. P&G lost market share across most of its product divisions in fiscal 2016 as revenue growth decelerated yet again. Executives are calling for that negative trend to stop in fiscal 2017 as organic growth ticks up to 2% from 1%. Investors are likely to see solid profit gains and greater cash returns in either case, but they'll need to watch organic growth -- especially organic sales volumes -- for evidence that a real turnaround has finally taken hold.

From the paring down of the freedom of religion to the freedom of worship to the basket of deplorables, Hillary Clinton’s comments were certainly clues of her campaign’s disdain for those whose faith is important in their lives. Those clues were confirmed this week in a scandal involving two chiefs of the campaign. Proving that Donald Trump’s mouth isn’t the only liability in this race, Clinton’s Communications Director, Jennifer Palmiere, has gotten the campaign in plenty of hot water with her 2011 email exchange with equally prejudiced John Halpin from the Center for American Progress. The messages (which also included Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta) surfaced in the latest WikiLeaks dump, giving undecided voters plenty to think about before November 8. Halpin kicked off the insult-fest with a nod to the CEO of Fox News, Rupert Murdoch, a Catholic who — shock of shocks — raised his children Catholic. “Ken Auletta’s latest piece on Murdoch in the New Yorker starts off with the aside that both Murdoch and Robert Thompson, managing editor of the WSJ, are raising their kids Catholic. Friggin' Murdoch baptized his kids in Jordan where John the Baptist baptized Jesus,” he wrote to Palmiere and Podesta. Going on, he added, “Many of the most powerful elements of the conservative movement are all Catholic (many converts) from the SC and think tanks to the media and social groups. It’s an amazing bastardization of the faith. They must be attracted to the systematic thought and severely backwards gender relations and must be totally unaware of Christian democracy.” They’re probably Catholic, Hillary’s Communications Director chimed in, because they think it’s “the most socially acceptable politically conservative religion.” Then, taking a swipe at Protestants, she said, “Their rich friends wouldn’t understand if they became evangelicals.” The comments are revealing because they show that Hillary Clinton’s attack on Bible-believing Christians (when she called them a “basket of deplorables,” in front of an LGBTQ crowd) were consistent with the broader campaign’s contempt for conservative Christians. Even more telling, she not only smeared those who believe in biblical morality as deplorable, she also said they were “irredeemable” (which was a bit ironic, considering that redemption is the crux of the Christian faith). Unfortunately, this is just par for the intolerant course in the Clinton campaign, which has just as much contempt for Christians' beliefs on issues like abortion, religious liberty, marriage, gender identity, and sexuality. A staunch supporter of the culture of death, Planned Parenthood, abortion mandates, same-sex marriage, transgender rights, and more, Hillary has been offending the Christian faith that she claims to hold for the last 30 years. And it’s clear that her staff is cut from the same cloth. What’s even more infuriating is that the campaign will go to the mat to protect American Muslims, but when it comes to conservative Catholics and evangelicals, Clinton — like most liberals — thinks that’s an acceptable form of discrimination. As I told Megyn Kelly [Tuesday] night on Fox News (video below), this should be troubling to anyone who wants to live by their faith. Clinton and her staff honestly believe that people who actually want to live by their faith are backwater people. The elitists see religion as a glorified social club — but if you want to live your life according to Scripture, they hold you in disdain. And talk about a double standard! The Left is demanding Donald Trump’s head for his deplorable comments about women, but they give Clinton’s campaign a pass for abusing the world’s largest religion! Imagine if the GOP’s team had said what Halpin and Palmiere did. They’d be in the streets with pitchforks! Trump alluded as much at a rally today, where he blasted his opponent for harboring such animosity in her camp. “The new e-mails also show members of the Clinton team attacking Catholic and Evangelicals… viciously. That will not be tolerated by the voters… This is hatred from Hillary Clinton… I tell you what, can you imagine me if any of this pertained to me? Front page headlines.” Let this be a lesson to any Christian who thought Hillary Clinton may be a viable option to Donald Trump. Her campaign doesn’t respect your faith — and it sure doesn’t respect your right to practice it. Originally published here. Procter Doesn’t Gamble in North Carolina Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (P&G) is hardly immune to pressure from LGBT (“lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender”) activists. It has boasted to its shareholders about treating “sexual orientation” and “gender identity and expression” as protected categories and about receiving a perfect score on the pro-LGBT Human Rights Campaign’s “Corporate Equality Index.” It has even endorsed “U.S. federal legislation that would prohibit workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity” (presumably, the dangerous so-called “Equality Act”). However, this week its shareholders drew the line at joining the corporate witch hunt against states that have passed modest legislation to protect religious liberty, privacy, and safety. P&G’s shareholders soundly rejected a proposal offered by NorthStar Asset Management, a small investment group headed by Julie Goodridge (lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, Goodridge v. Dept. of Public Health, that first brought same-sex “marriage” to Massachusetts). NorthStar criticized varied bills adopted this year by Mississippi (forbidding government discrimination against religious views), Tennessee (protecting conscience rights of counselors and therapists), and North Carolina (protecting bathrooms in government buildings), and requested that P&G prepare a report “detailing the known and potential risks and costs to the Company” from such laws. Justin Danhof of the National Center for Public Policy opposed the measure at the shareholders' meeting, pointing out false claims in the NorthStar proposal, and noting that the issues involved are largely irrelevant to P&G’s business. Danhof said that the proposals could damage the company’s brand and “harm the company’s bottom line while helping no one.” (Interestingly, NorthStar itself apparently engages in sex discrimination — hiring only women!) P&G’s Board of Directors concluded the proposal was worded too “broadly and vaguely,” and the proposed report “is unnecessary and would not provide meaningful information.” Shareholders agreed, with only six percent of the shares outstanding voting in favor of this attack upon state laws. Corporations should stay neutral in the culture wars; and certainly should not ally themselves with those attacking religious liberty. Originally published here. Bad Company: CA Takes Baby Body Parts Dealers to Task On Tuesday, the District Attorney of Orange County, California, filed a lawsuit against several medical research companies alleging they illegally profited off the sale of baby body parts or “fetal tissue.” According to the Orange County Register, the suit alleges that these companies are “illegally profiting off the sale of fetal tissue donated from abortion providers.” While the law allows firms to have their expenses covered for supplying “fetal tissue,” they cannot profit off it. However, the Orange County DA “alleges that DaVinci Biosciences and its sister company DV Biologics advertised and sold hundreds of units of fetal tissue and stem cells to research facilities around the world, collecting tens of thousands of dollars in revenue.” If proven, this is both atrocious and illegal. Interestingly, as the Center for Medical Progress (CMP) points out, the targets of the suit are “Planned Parenthood of Orange & San Bernardino Counties' longtime baby body parts business partners [and] sister companies.” It turns out that what’s atrocious may have occurred here. In a scheme taking place over the course of eight years, according to CMP, “Planned Parenthood supplied aborted baby hearts, lungs, brains, and intestines to DV Biologics, which DV Biologics then resold for profit. In exchange for merely providing access to aborted baby body parts, Planned Parenthood received kickback contributions from DaVinci Biosciences over the course of their eight-year contract.” It’s no surprise that DaVinci Biosciences and DV Biologics also profited from the sale of baby body parts as did its competitors StemExpress and Advanced Bioscience Resources (ABR), two such companies that were under investigation by the Select Panel on Infant Lives. The Select Panel already revealed in its interim report how StemExpress and ABR have profited from the sale of baby body parts, as evidenced by receipts, invoices, order forms, purchase orders, internal emails, and sales spreadsheets. One thing’s for sure — this case will shed light on some important issues. If DaVinci Biosciences is found guilty, it points to Planned Parenthood’s involvement and guilt as an accomplice in these matters. Could DaVinci Biosciences really have sold baby body parts for profit without Planned Parenthood’s intimate involvement in giving it access to fresh, intact fetal organs? Eight years is a long time, and it’s reasonable to infer that Planned Parenthood either knew or should have known what DaVinci Biosciences was doing over the course of those many years. Moreover, if one district attorney in California can bring such a case, evidence likely exists for authorities to bring such charges in other jurisdictions. Law enforcement elsewhere should follow suit and look into these allegations in the other states where they have arisen. We may ask, and the public should be asking: Could it be that CMP was right all along? Doesn’t this show what its videos claimed and what it previously alleged? When the CMP videos surfaced throughout last year, the mainstream media and many abortion supporters tried to minimize them and brush them away because of the inconvenient truths they contained and the implications for their biggest abortion patron: Planned Parenthood. The truth won’t go away, however, and this lawsuit and latest incidence of these atrocities at a minimum demand an honest investigation and accounting. Originally published here.

Speaking at Advertising Week 2016 in New York, Pritchard argued that P&G's digital campaigns do not always have to be aimed at an extremely granular, and narrow, group. "Every audience is a target," he said. (For more details of the company's approach, read Warc's exclusive report: Procter & Gamble rethinks reach on Facebook.) "So you need to think about, 'How many are you targeting?' If you want to reach all category buyers of toothpaste, it's almost everybody. If you want to reach pregnant women in their first trimester, it's a much narrower target." This assertion followed on from recent headlines in the national and trade press indicating that P&G was scaling back its use of targeted ads on Facebook – notions that Pritchard suggested were taken slightly out of context. "We wanted to get more reach," he said. And having discussed that objective with its partners at Facebook, the FMCG manufacturer learned that it should consider tweaking its own tactics in this area. "We looked at it, and said, 'We were making choices on targeting that were too narrow, in some cases.' In some cases, it was great," Pritchard said. "So we said, 'Look, let's open it up; let's get more reach.' So, now we can get 70 or 80 million users. And when we want to be targeted even more precisely, we do that." Drilling down into this subject, Pritchard reported that in the consumer-products business, brands with everyday usage must typically reach significant numbers of people with the right level of frequency. "Our brands have to be top of mind. They have to be top of mind because they use it every day, and they purchase it very frequently," he reminded the Advertising Week attendees.

It has now become compulsory for all management courses to include diversity training.   All managers are expected to develop a culture that fosters inclusion within their teams. Last year we introduced the Intentionally Inclusive Leadership Course for senior leaders that builds the competencies and behaviours necessary for successful inclusive leadership. Through the course, senior leaders are enabled to make truly unbiased judgments and decisions about team member’s potential and performance.   We also run a series of diversity courses that builds both the capability of both managers and employees in various areas of diversity and inclusion, under our ‘@work’ branding which has been intentionally designed to draw focus and attention to these topics. Some examples include ‘Cultures@Work’, ‘People with Disabilities@work’, ‘GABLE@work’ (covering LGBT), ‘Flex@work’ (covering flexible work arrangements), and ‘Gender@work’. Why is it so important to offer training for staff in all areas?  Our people are the source of our competitive advantage, and our success depends on the strength of our talent pipeline. We recruit those who we see as leaders of the future and developing our people is hugely important. We apply the same rigour we use to develop innovation within our brands, and apply it to how we develop people and this happens at every level; from our apprenticeships through to our senior leaders.

The most famous example is North Carolina's so-called HB 2 "bathroom law," which requires people to use the public restroom according to their gender at birth. What many view as common sense, and a safety issue, launched protests and boycotts led by homosexual activists and their corporate allies who accused state leaders of supporting "hate" and "bigotry" against transgenders. A plan to include Procter & Gamble in the effort failed, however, after Northstar Investment Management asked investors to join the effort. Justin Danhof of the National Center for Public Policy Research attended the meeting and calls the conclusion a victory for religious liberty. But that victory is short-lived, he says, because activist investors aided by a dishonest press are still winning, and an anti-religious movement is growing. "And threatening the liberty of millions," Danhof tells OneNewsNow. OneNewsNow reported in a Sept. story that Trillium Asset Managment, an influential international investment company is led by a homosexual CEO who is arm-twisting corporations to punish North Carolina.  But the Northstar proposal on Tuesday was overwhelmingly rejected, with only about six percent of the shares outstanding voting in favor of the proposal. In a related radio interview Wednesday on "Washington Watch with Tony Perkins," Phil Burress of Ohio-based Citizens for Community Values says he was not surprised shareholders rejected the proposal. Proctor & Gamble is not perfect, Burress told Perkins, but he went on to describe how pro-family leaders were invited years ago to sit down with senior management and discuss issues. "The public is with us on these issues," said Burress. "These companies like Target and others are trying to force their values, joining the media to try to force these values on us." "I was proud to help defeat the proposal," says Danhof, who often loses in his confrontation with corporate leaders and shareholders. "And I was proud that the company didn't just accept it, that the executives seemed to understand that this was a fight that frankly they don't belong in." But there are many more powerful corporations involved in the wrong side of that fight, he adds, so there's more work to be done.  We moderate all reader comments, usually within 24 hours of posting (longer on weekends).

Under the terms of the agreement, Gain Life will join Solera's integrated network of partners who are preventing and managing chronic disease. Gain Life's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognized Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is one of the few lifestyle modification initiatives being made available that is focused on men and women's unique health and wellness needs. The company's DPP for males, ManUP Health, and females, PowerUP Health, offer individuals with prediabetes a 52- week program that curbs the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The program focuses on improving metabolic flexibility and changing mindsets with the guidance and accountability of a dedicated coach and support of peers, completely online by smart phone, tablet, or computer. Adding these gender specific offerings to Solera's growing roster of chronic disease prevention and management program partners, provides patients with even greater choice when it comes to selecting a personalized approach to lifestyle modification to help them achieve what they want (reduced health risks and weight loss), while building into the process what they really require (change in mindset). Through its preventative health network, Solera allows members of participating health plans to simply and easily enroll in a DPP best suited to meet their unique individual needs and preferences. For partners like Gain Life, Solera provides increased access to qualified patients and payer reimbursement while also helping to manage the back office logistics associated with administrating a chronic disease prevention program. "Currently, the majority of weight loss and diabetes prevention initiatives in the market today are not tailored to the proven health needs specific to each gender, which could possibly account for why over 80% of program participants are typically women," said Brenda Schmidt, CEO of Solera Health. "In our work at Solera, we are seeing a huge demand from health plan clients who are increasingly interested in DPPs that meet the specific needs of their diverse population. We believe that through Gain Life's targeted approach of honoring gender differences in life roles, values and identity has a huge opportunity to improve DPP program engagement for this unique demographic." The Gain Life DPP was created around the belief that a "one-size-fits-all" approach to healthcare, especially with regards to lifestyle intervention, simply isn't going to work. By meeting individual's where they live/work/play, understanding their circumstances, and tailoring the programs to meet their needs, the company is creating a more personable approach to diabetes prevention that empowers patients to take control of their own health. "We are excited to enter this partnership with Solera Health as the relationship increases exposure and access to Gain Life's gender-specific lifestyle change programs for those in need. At a broader level, the relationship affords us the opportunity to be part of the company's ambitious solution to one of the country's largest healthcare problems," said Sean Eldridge, CEO of Gain Life. "In our eyes, the more folks that team up and work together to further minimize the behaviors that lead to chronic disease, the better our chances of having of real impact on eradicating these conditions in the long term." About Solera Health Solera Health is a chronic disease prevention and management integrator that connects patients, payers, and physicians with a new class of non-clinical healthcare providers, simply and securely. Solera helps consolidate highly fragmented programs and services into one integrated network, allowing health plans and medical providers to increase consumer participation while lowering associated costs. Solera proactively identifies the "best fit" program provider based on each individual's unique needs and preferences, which has proven to have a significant impact on improved patient outcomes at a fraction of the cost of traditional medical care.

Who is Aftab? Fast-rising star, Dems say Jason Williams , jwilliams@enquirer.com 1:52 p.m. EDT October 13, 2016 Aftab Pureval (Photo: Provided) Politics Extra is a weekly column looking inside local politics (Scroll to the bottom to read "Micro-scoops & more") Political rookie Aftab Pureval is tirelessly working to gain name recognition among Hamilton County voters. In doing so, the Hamilton County Clerk of Courts candidate has caught the attention of Democratic power players from here to Columbus and Washington. The party has quickly slapped the "rising star" label on Pureval, the dapper Procter & Gamble attorney. "I got a call from Sherrod Brown and he said 'I've taken notice of Aftab Pureval. How can we get him elected?' " Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said, referring to Ohio's senior U.S. senator. Brown is scheduled to be in Cincinnati on Friday for a fundraiser to help Pureval and other local candidates. In July, Pureval joined Pepper and others for a press conference in response to the GOP's nomination of Donald Trump for president. A video of the press conference caught the attention of a Democratic National Committee official in Washington. Pepper soon received a call from the DNC official inquiring about Pureval, a 34-year-old former federal prosecutor. "He has very quickly impressed a lot of people in Ohio and beyond," said Pepper, the former Hamilton County Commissioner and Cincinnati City Councilman. Catching the party's attention might be Pureval's biggest victory in this campaign, regardless of the election results. The Hyde Park resident faces a tough task in beating Republican incumbent Clerk of Courts Tracy Winkler. The GOP has long had a stranglehold on the clerk's office, and few names are more recognizable in Hamilton County politics than Winkler. Insiders tell Politics Extra multiple polls show Winkler with a sizable lead in the race. CINCINNATI.COM Watch: 'Aftab!' duck to quack on local TV Those were conducted before Pureval launched his first television ad this week, a fun 30-second spot featuring a duck puppet quacking "Aftab!" in a spoof of the Aflac insurance commercials. It's just the beginning of a $125,000 ad blitz leading up to the Nov. 8 election, and he has more money to spend. Perhaps no one has ever pursued the clerk's office as aggressively as Pureval, the son of Indian immigrants and a first-generation American. Pureval was granted a six-month leave of absence from P&G so he could campaign full-time. He has put 30,000 miles on his Jeep Grand Cherokee in the past 11 months campaigning across the county. Pureval has raised over $200,000, a lot for a clerk's race. He has laid out a clear vision for the office. Pureval says he'll establish a legal self-help center, form a housing court and upgrade technology to allow easier access to court documents. Who does all that for any local race, let alone the clerk of courts? That all-out effort has Ohio Democrats viewing Pureval as part of the "bench" of candidates Pepper is trying to build to better compete in future statewide and Congressional races. Pepper mentions Pureval and his efforts when talking to party leaders and donors across the state. "Aftab is in the PowerPoint," Pepper said. "He is a perfect example of the kind of talented person we are hoping to inspire to get into public office." Careful what you put in writing: Part 1 Head-scratcher of the week comes courtesy of Hyde Park Republican Tamie Sullivan, who is expected to run for City Council next year. "I am a Republican woman who is voting for Hillary Clinton for president," Sullivan wrote in an Enquirer op-ed. She's certainly not alone in choosing Clinton over Trump, but Sullivan might have severely jeopardized any hopes of a political career. Republicans certainly took notice after the op-ed posted to Cincinnati.com on Wednesday morning. “A vote for Hillary Clinton is almost automatically disqualifying from receiving Republican support,” Hamilton County GOP Chairman Alex Triantafilou told Politics Extra. Sullivan's political misstep could help Amy Murray's bid for re-election. There's probably only room for one white female Republican from Hyde Park on Council. Careful what you put in writing: The sequel The next head-scratching decision by a Republican comes courtesy of Don Robinson, Winkler's chief deputy bailiff. Robinson on Sept. 1 sent an email from his personal account to clerk of courts employees implying it was part of their jobs to campaign for Winkler. "Please don't let me run into you with another shirt on when you could/should have been wearing Winkler attire," Robinson wrote, according to the email provided by Pureval's campaign this week. "The other candidates know that since the clerk is running, and you work for her, that you SHOULD be wearing her attire." Robinson sent the email during work hours and it's a no-no to require public employees to get involved in politics. Elected officials often hire their political supporters to fill "patronage" jobs – both parties do it – and employees can help with campaigns on their off time. Robinson is a long-time public employee, and his message was inexcusable. Politics Extra asked Winkler if Robinson has been reprimanded. "I became aware of an email sent by an employee using his personal email account," Winkler said. "I was disappointed in his comments, as we have run a positive campaign with many great volunteers. I met with the employee and expressed my strong displeasure and told him that this type of comment will never be tolerated by me or anyone in my office. I've taken corrective action and I'm confident this will never happen again. I consider the matter closed." Micro scoops & more • "Orange Is The New Black" stars Taylor Schilling and KateMulgrew have accepted Pepper's invitation to come to Ohio and campaign. Schilling, who's won several awards for her leading role as "Piper Chapman" in the Netflix original series, Mulgrew ("Red") and Pepper will visit six college campuses across northern Ohio on Friday and Saturday. Pepper met the celebrities during an Ohio Democratic Party fundraiser in New York last month. "I asked them to come to Ohio, that they could really help inspire Millennials to get involved," Pepper said. "They’re very energized about it." • Take Charlie Winburn's talk of running for mayor seriously. Insiders say the Republican City Councilman has made several fundraising calls over the past few weeks. Winburn faces being term-limited off council next year, and no job opportunities have materialized so far. • After getting caught in the political crosshairs of the streetcar last week, the company in charge of operations went out and hired a local lobbyist. Transdev has contracted with Matt Davis, president of Downtown-based DSD Advisors. This is a good – and probably overdue – move by Transdev, which was hired 15 months ago. The city and SORTA have put pressure on Transdev to run more streetcars on weekends and speed up its service. Davis, the Cincinnati Chamber's former top lobbyist, is highly respected by local, state and Washington politicians. • City Councilman Christopher Smitherman this week continued his courtship with the Republican party by endorsing Pat DeWine for Ohio Supreme Court judge race this week. • Former local television anchor Clyde Gray has been hired as the spokesman for Democratic Congressional candidate Michele Young, who is running against incumbent Republican Steve Chabot. Gray has been running his own communications firm since retiring from TV in 2014, and this is his first venture into a political campaign. • Trump's campaign made a public-relations blunder here this week. It invited the media to Sunday's Hamilton County debate watch party, then didn't let an Enquirer reporter into the event. Later that night, the campaign said it was actually OK for the media to enter the 20th Century Theater in Oakley. It turned out to be a miscommunication between the paid staff in Columbus and volunteer leaders in Hamilton County. Just the latest display of amateur hour for Trump's campaign in the region.

Ohio produces less renewable energy than Kentucky. Is that OK? Carrie Blackmore Smith , csmith@enquirer.com 9:34 a.m. EDT October 17, 2016 A look at Ohio's sources of electricity. (Photo: Carrie Blackmore Smith) Story Highlights What did Gov. John Kasich say about this in Texas that got people talking? And, learn where Kasich and Ohio Sen. Bill Seitz stand on climate change. How much of Ohio's electricity is powered by renewable energy? Five percent? Ten? According to the most recent annual report of the U.S. Energy Information Administration, it's 2 percent. In other words, 98 percent of the energy powering Ohio's lights, stoves, air conditioners and so much more is created from nonrenewable sources, like coal and natural gas. Is that OK? And if not, should state government do anything about it? Climate change and fossil fuel dependence are some of the greatest issues of our day, hotly debated during this election season. Now, Ohio's power future is front and center again. Ohio Sen. Bill Seitz, who represents about half of Hamilton County, has suggested a new way forward for the Buckeye State, three months before a freeze on mandatory clean energy regulations is scheduled to be lifted. You see, Ohio passed a law eight years ago – when Democrat Ted Strickland was governor and Republicans controlled both the Ohio Senate and House. The bill required private energy companies to gradually increase the percentage of power created with alternative energies to 25 percent by 2025. In 2014, Republicans altered the rules, lowering the percentage to 12.5 by 2027 and freezing the regulations for two years, while politicians studied the topic. That freeze is scheduled to expire Dec. 31, and the 12.5 percent by 2027 would go into effect. The first benchmark –3.5 percent by the end of 2017 – would need to be met or a company would face fines. Duke Energy, which provides electricity to Southwest Ohio, said it will comply with any mandates but "believes that it would be more beneficial for Ohio to incentivize Ohio utilities to build, own, operate and dedicate to Ohioans renewable energy projects located within the state rather than have the current mandate, which does not accomplish that goal." Seitz, of Green Township, is talking about altering the standards again. But he has a unique adversary – Republican Gov. John Kasich – who has publicly threatened to veto any bill that suspends the standards further, a sentiment that fueled some to call Kasich a moderate option in the presidential primary season. What Kasich would prefer is a bit of a mystery. A few weeks ago, he said "the standards that were set were unrealistic." Did Kasich mean 25 percent by 2025 or 12.5 percent by 2027? The Enquirer asked, but was told by a spokesperson that "the governor has been clear on his position regarding energy standards." Seitz is now suggesting the requirements become voluntary goals for the next three years, along with some other alterations to the law. The senator said he "may make a couple changes before we submit it to the committee" soon after the November election. No surprise, environmentalists and clean energy advocates want standards with teeth – and so do some Republicans and a majority of Ohioans. A Yale University poll released in 2014 reported that 58 percent of adults in Ohio supported requiring utilities to produce 20 percent of electricity from renewable sources. Ohio is behind almost every American state when it comes to the percentage of renewable energy it creates. The United States, as a whole, sits at nearly 14 percent. As for our neighboring states; Indiana generates 5 percent of its electric power from renewables, defined as conventional hydroelectric, wind, solar, geothermal or biomass (organic waste) power. Kentucky is nearing 5 percent, Michigan 8 percent and both Pennsylvania and West Virginia are around 4 percent, according to the 2015 annual figures kept by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. By comparison, California generates 33 percent of its electricity from renewable energies. The costs and health risks related to climate change and the pollution created by burning fossil fuels are something more and more companies, universities and government entities recognize and want to change, said Steve Melink, owner of Melink Corp., in Clermont County's Union Township. His company builds solar power and geothermal heating and cooling systems and also sells products and services that add energy efficiency to commercial kitchens and homes. Melink has done work for companies such as Marriott, Whole Foods and Procter & Gamble, he said. "Let's do the right thing and set the right standards. Either follow the world – or lead it," Melink said. Lebanon native Tyler Duvelius, a board member of the Ohio Conservative Energy Forum and an executive member of Ohio Young Republicans, says what's happening right now just isn't working, and it means Ohio is missing out attracting 21st-century jobs and companies. Many big companies, including Facebook, General Motors, Adobe and Coca-Cola have committed to operate 100 percent of their business with renewable energy, some as soon as 2020. "The previous standards might be too high for some conservatives, but there's a serious discussion about how we find a true standard," said Duvelius, who is also the Ohio director for the Christian Coalition. "You don't have to open your Bible very far to where you hear God calling on us to take care of his creation," Duvelius said. To that, Seitz said, "It's not the government's job to legislate morality." Ohio Sen. Bill Seitz, a Republican from Cincinnati, has been one of the most active politicians in the clean energy regulations debate in recent years.  (Photo: Provided) Seitz's view on clean energy regulations 1. The senator's view on climate change. "My view on climate change is that the climate has changed for millions of years and continues to change. I think there may be a contribution from manmade sources." 2. Seitz: This is about cost. During a 45-minute interview on the topic, Seitz said, "this is not about renewable energy" and "this is not about coal. ... Since everyone is for clean energy and thinks it's free, we thought it would be a good idea to disclose on their bill just how much we are paying for this stuff ... By golly, here we are at the lower reaches of it (3 percent) and we're going to 12.5 percent on renewables, and we have bill increases of about 9 percent. We're not trying to protect the utilities here, we are trying to protect the ratepayer ... I recently read that wind and solar prices would decline by 59 percent by 2026. So my answer is: We'll buy it in 2026." Note: Seitz made clear that he meant an increase of 9 percent on the "generation" portion of people's utility bills, not the total cost.  2. Renewable energy companies are already getting a tax break.  "Federal taxpayers, which include you, me and everybody I guess but Donald Trump, are paying them a 30 percent subsidy now," Seitz said, referring to the renewable electricity production tax credit. "Why do you (companies) not only need this generous tax break and require the states to mandate that the utilities buy your overpriced stuff?" 3. Ohio isn't a good state for solar and wind. "Natural gas is what we have in Ohio. We are not a particularly good sun or wind state. There are places where that makes a great deal of sense – extremely windy and extremely sunny places." Note: Ohio's photovoltaic solar power potential runs in the middle of the pack, when compared with rest of the country, according to the Renewable Energy Technology Resource Maps and Technical Potential for the United States last updated in 2012. Ohio is on the lower half of the spectrum for wind potential and has better potential for biomass products like wood waste and landfill gas. Much of the state is "least unfavorable" for geothermal resources. 4. Senator asks why create state rules until we know what will happen with the federal Clean Power Plan?  "Under the Clean Power Plan, the federal government mandates to reduce carbon dioxide by 30 some percent by 2030. ... Why would we subject Ohio businesses and Ohio residents to escalating costs under the 2008 state mandate until we know how these mandates sync up?" Note: Ohio emits the fifth largest amount of carbon dioxide in the United States, though it is joined at the top of the list with other states that are the most populated. For context, the U.S. Supreme Court halted implementation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan after more than two dozen states requested a stay earlier this year. A legal case over whether the EPA has the authority to hold states to the standards is currently being heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals. However, despite Seitz's argument, 30 states have passed renewable portfolio standards that are not voluntary. What did Gov. John Kasich say in Texas? Ohio Gov. John Kasich recently sat down with CEO and co-founder of the nonprofit Texas Tribune Evan Smith for The Texas Tribute Festival in Austin, Texas. They spoke about a wide variety of issues facing America, energy and the environment were two of them. Evan Smith: You, I believe, have said climate change is ... Kasich: I think it’s real. I don’t want to overreact to it, but I think it’s real.  Smith: You know, the mere fact that you say those words, that’s a controversial thing. Kasich: Look, look. You know, when you get to be in public life, where you get responsibility, put your hands on the wheel and drive the car. What am I supposed to do? Take a poll? Who’s going to like this or that? Now look, when I say I believe there’s climate change, what do you do about it? I’m not for shutting down all this fossil fuel, I think this is extreme. Smith: You did advocate for a tax on hydraulic fracturing, did you not? Kasich: Yours (in Texas) is higher than ours, and I’d like to get ours higher so I can cut my income tax, instead of you taking all my liquids out of my state and living high on the hog here in Texas, you know. I like you, but I don’t like that idea. What I’m saying is, I think we need everything. Look, the Tesla is an amazing car. Are we going to get a breakthrough in battery technology? If we do, it will change everything in this country. I believe in solar and wind and all that, but let me tell you, I believe in fossil fuels, as well. With coal – clean it. Dig it, clean it and burn it. Nuclear power, you know ... I think there are a lot of people who are extreme, but this environment needs to be managed. I believe this Earth was given to us by the Lord, and we have an obligation to take care of it, but not worship it. Later, during a question and answer session: Man with question: According to a Mother Jones 2014 report, Ohio ranks 5th in carbon emissions producing some of the dirtiest energy in the country. As someone saying you stand by 98 percent of the international scientific community on climate change, do you find it hypocritical that you cited scrapping EPA regulations, the endorsement of fossil fuels and criticized last year’s climate deal in Paris? Kasich: My issue of Mother Jones didn’t come this month, so I haven’t checked those statistics. We reduced emissions in Ohio by 20 percent or the last seven, eight years, and we have also done a lot when it comes to methane in our fracking. We also have been very pro-environment, we put a billion dollars into cleaning up the lake (Erie). I said it earlier, if you have coal, you dig it, you clean it and then you burn it. We spend a lot of money on scrubbers in the state of Ohio, but emissions are down – and that’s a good thing. I am for developing all of these other resources and we have a program in Ohio that requires us to meet these certain standards. I’ve told the legislature, the standards that were set were unrealistic but if you try to kill the standards, whether it has to do with the renewables or whether it has to do with the issue of saving energy, I’ll veto the bill and we’ll go to the higher standards. I’m committed to it. 385 CONNECTTWEET 34 LINKEDIN 12 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2eA4hds TOP VIDEOS Sam DuBose sister: 'This, to me, is murder' 1:30 Protests in Cincinnati after Ray Tensing mistrial 1:09 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Mistrial declared in Ray Tensing case 3:46 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 Cincinnati Police Criminalist: Tensing 'seemed nervous or afraid' 2:59 Crime lab: No evidence on Tensing’s boots that he was dragged 4:07 Alternate juror in Ray Tensing trial has been dismissed 1:24 Lakota East's Horter wins state cross country 2:58 Born in Cincinnati, celebrated around the world: An anthem that unites us 3:39 Division I volleyball regional semifinals 1:46 More Stories Who the heck is Marilyn Z?

Share this article Share Oreo cookie-maker Mondelez International Inc tried to buy the company earlier this year after its shares were up 1.4 percent in pre-market trading.    Hersheys has appointed a special committee to search for a new CEO, led by Pamela Arway, chairwoman of the board's governance committee, aided by executive search firm Egon Zehnder. The company also maintained its full-year outlook as Bilbrey announced July 1 would be his last day in the job.   The move comes less than three months after the charitable trust that controls Hershey reached a major reform agreement with its overseer, the Pennsylvania attorney general's office, raising questions about its future plans for the company. The company, which is based in the town of Hershey, Pennsylvania, has a market capitalization of around $20billion. Bilbrey was named CEO of Hershey in 2011, after serving in various senior roles at the company since 2003.  He added the position of chairman in 2015.  Prior to Hershey, Bilbrey worked for 22 years at consumer company Procter and Gamble Co.  Following an initial spurned bid in June, Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld re-approached Bilbrey in August, indicating that Mondelez would be willing to offer $115 a share. Prior to Hershey, Bilbrey (center in light suit) worked for 22 years at consumer company Procter and Gamble Co Hershey responded to that offer by stating it would not be willing to enter into deal negotiations for an offer of less than $125 per share, a source said at the time.  The Hershey trust was set up by the company's founder over a century ago to fund and run a school for underprivileged children.  It holds 81 percent of the company's voting stock, and so a sale is not possible without its approval.  About two-thirds of its $12billion in assets are in Hershey stock.  Following a dispute with the Pennsylvania attorney general over its governance policy, the trust in July agreed to expand its board from 10 members to 13, and for five members to resign by year's end. With one trustee having resigned shortly before that agreement, that leaves a total of nine openings.  Even if the trust does decide to explore a sale of Hershey, the attorney general can thwart such plans.

But by the 1980s, social critics were sounding alarms that a groundswell of actual Satanic activity was responsible for subversive, soul-polluting behavior. A 1980 book, Michelle Remembers, purported to tell the story of Satanists who kidnapped and brainwashed a young woman, a spark that led to both the media and law enforcement driving home narratives that blamed ritualistic evil for crime and mass entertainment. Take a look at eight instances where self-appointed pop culture analysts insisted the devil was in the details.  1. SATAN'S VESSELS: THUNDERCATS AND THE SMURFS YouTube In 1986, author Phil Phillips published Turmoil in the Toybox, a book detailing how Masters of the Universe and other popular cartoons of the era were endorsing Pagan practices through coaxial cables. With pastor Gary Greenwald, Phillips also shot a video that elaborated on his theories. “The question is, is there a well organized plot, an insidious design right now, to program and influence the minds of our children toward the occult and witchcraft?” Greenwald asked. It was rhetorical, as the two explained that the ThunderCats were inspired by “heathen gods,” that E.T. “died and was resurrected again” and could therefore be confused with Christian figures, and that “there are things we need to look at concerning The Smurfs.” Because the characters are blue with black lips, they were “depictive of dead creatures.” Collectively, Saturday morning cartoons would teach children “to get into spells and witchcraft.” The two concluded their video essay by pointing out that Rainbow Brite had a Pentagram on her cheek. 2. THE JUDAS PRIEST TRIAL University of Lethbridge In December 1985, 18-year-old Raymond Belknap and 20-year-old James Vance ended a long night of drinking by committing to a suicide pact. Belknap shot and killed himself; Vance attempted to do the same but wound up surviving—with grievous and permanent disfiguring injury—the shotgun blast. Both men had been fans of the rock band Judas Priest, who had been reputed to have recorded subliminal messages in their music. Vance’s parents decided to sue the band and CBS Records for $6.2 million in damages, alleging phrases like “do it” and “let’s be dead” were being delivered to Vance’s subconscious. When the case went to a civil trial in 1990, audio engineers played the group's music backward and forward at varying speeds in an attempt to discern whether or not there were any hidden urgings for listeners to kill themselves. Ultimately, a judge ruled there were no messages in the music. Speaking to Rolling Stone in 2015, lead singer Rob Halford expressed both relief and disappointment in the tragic circumstances. “Had the judge found in favor about the so-called subliminal messages having the power to physically manifest themselves and make people to do something, the ramifications of that would've been extraordinary,” he said. “How do you prove to somebody that there are not subliminal messages on your record when you can't hear them in the first place?” 3. THE DUNGEON MASTER iStock Introduced in 1974, Dungeons and Dragons quickly captured the imaginations of gamers who relished the opportunity to take on different guises in fantasy settings—and almost immediately found themselves embroiled in controversies over the game’s sorcery and occult elements. That hysteria reached new levels with the 1979 disappearance of James Egbert, a 16-year-old computer science student who was believed to have gotten lost in the underground steam tunnels near Michigan State University. The media quickly jumped on the theory that Egbert had become too absorbed in his role-playing and suffered a mental breakdown. The truth was less sinister, though just as tragic: Egbert had been suffering from the demands of being a child prodigy as well as shame over his homosexuality, prompting him to run away from school. He committed suicide in 1980. A fictionalized account of the case, Mazes and Monsters, was made for television in 1982 and starred Tom Hanks. All the negative publicity—one mother formed a group labeled "BADD "for "Bothered About Dungeons and Dragons," while creator Gary Gygax hired a bodyguard after receiving death threats—was free advertising for the game’s publisher, TSR. D&D sold $16 million in rule books in 1982 alone. 4. PAMPERS DIAPERS iStock In 1985, Procter & Gamble found itself in the unusual position of having to hold a press conference to deny that they were funding a Satanic church. Since 1982, the company had been the target of anonymous accusations claiming their logo—a man in the moon surrounded by 13 stars—was secretly the mark of the devil. So many calls poured into the distributor of Ivory soap, Pampers diapers, and other household toiletries that they were forced to set up a toll-free number to refute allegations that they were beholden to the Church of Satan. (As for the stars: When the company was formed in 1882, they were intended to represent the original 13 colonies.) The rumors ultimately prompted Procter & Gamble to remove the symbol from its packaging. 5. THE MCMARTIN PRESCHOOL SCANDAL In one of the most sensationalized criminal trials of the 20th century, employees of the McMartin Preschool near Los Angeles stood accused of improper behavior and molestation of their students. After one 3-year-old’s mother grew convinced her son had been subject to abuse, several more children came forward. Some of the accounts included details of ritualistic animal slaughter, leading investigators to believe the school had become the epicenter of an occult organization. After a six-year trial—the longest in American history—no one was convicted; a post-mortem of the investigation revealed several children had been subject to coercive interviews with law enforcement.    6. THE MR. ED MESSAGE FROM HELL It wasn’t solely popular culture of the 1980s that was being examined for traces of occult worship. In 1986, two evangelists from Ohio—Jim Brown and Greg Hudson—claimed that they had excavated a hidden message in the unlikeliest of sources: the theme song from Mr. Ed. The 1960s sitcom about a talking horse opened with the title song “A Horse is a Horse.” Played backward, the preachers insisted, one could hear sinister undertones like “The Source is Satan” and “Someone heard this song for Satan.” The discovery was mentioned during a seminar for teenagers on the moral evaporation caused by rock music. The teens then burned 300 popular albums in a pyre. Despite the discovery, Brown said he didn’t think the producers of Mr. Ed were actual Satanists. “We don’t think they did it on purpose,” he said. 7. CHILD SACRIFICE ON HALLOWEEN iStock In 1989, parents in North Carolina were reluctant to send their children out for Halloween candy on the heels of rumors that Satanists planned to abduct and murder them in ritual sacrifice. More than 500 calls flooded area police stations in Raleigh after word spread that blonde boys from the ages of 2 to 5 were the devil worshippers’ preferred targets; mothers indicated they were considering dyeing their sons' hair to avoid a catastrophe. Police never found evidence of the plot. 8. THE GERALDO INCIDENT Geraldo's tips for profiling a Satanist. Kiran Kava via YouTube At the height of Satanic hysteria in 1988, broadcast journalist Geraldo Rivera compiled a two-hour special for NBC that purported to detail the lurid mission of devil worshippers. Devil Worship: Exposing Satan’s Underground posited that a secret cabal of Satanists numbering in excess of one million were responsible for messages in heavy metal and inspiring the behavior of cult leaders like Charles Manson. “The majority of them are linked in a highly organized, very secretive network,” Rivera intoned. “From small towns to large cities, they have attracted police and FBI attention to their satanic ritual child abuse, child pornography, and grisly Satanic murders. The odds are that this is happening in your town." The special aired in primetime to stellar ratings, grabbing the attention of nearly 20 million homes, although advertisers were reluctant to buy commercial spots. While Rivera presented a compelling case for concern, the mass media took care to note that the special didn’t come from NBC’s news programmers: it was a product of the network’s entertainment division.

You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You’re all set! Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Allan Sloan October 14 That ground-breaking program in Colorado? Warren Buffett's family paid for that. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) When Warren Buffett disclosed information from his own personal tax returns and stomped Donald Trump so skillfully a few days ago, the stories just wrote themselves. Buffett, who has called early and often for tax increases on America’s biggest earners, punched out the tax-dodging Trump for saying during Sunday’s presidential debate that Buffett “took a massive tax deduction” and that he was dodging taxes the same way Trump was. Buffett emerged triumphant. However, if Trump had done some homework, he could have said that Buffett, like Trump himself, has pursued aggressive, money-saving tax strategies. Which, in fact, Buffett has. But Buffett has pursued these strategies not for himself, but for the company he runs: Berkshire Hathaway. In transactions in 2014 and last year, Berkshire did three “cash-rich split-off” transactions that allowed it to end up with lots of cash and assets while avoiding what I estimate to be a total of about $2.5 billion in capital gains taxes. Berkshire did what amounted to complicated trades with three companies whose shares it had owned for years, swapping those holdings for a combination of cash and operating assets. The transactions are treated by the IRS as tax-free trades, rather than sales. For example, Berkshire got $450 million in cash and a business valued at $900 million from Phillips 66 in return for its Phillips 66 shares, which were valued at $660 million in 2012 when ConocoPhillips (a stock Berkshire had bought in 2008) spun off Phillips 66 to Berkshire and its other shareholders. Berkshire did similar stock-for-cash-and-assets swaps with Graham Holdings (former owner of The Washington Post) and Procter & Gamble. By my count, the three transactions that yielded cash and assets were worth $6.2 billion more than Berkshire’s $1 billion total cost for its stock in the companies, which in the case of Graham Holdings dated back more than 40 years. At a combined state and federal tax rate of about 40 percent—there is no special capital gains rate for corporations—selling its holdings in those three companies for cash would have triggered a $2.5 billion tax bill. But because Berkshire (whose shareholders include me) swapped shares for cash and other assets in split-off transactions, it realized major gains but didn’t have to pay gains tax. I’ve previously written about these three transactions, as well as a fourth one that Berkshire did in 2008. I emailed Buffett’s assistant Thursday seeking comment but did not receive a response. I had tried to speak with Buffett about these deals last year, but he said wouldn’t talk with me because he didn’t like the way I had written about a different tax-aggressive transaction that Berkshire was involved in. To wit, that was the 2014 deal in which Berkshire helped Burger King desert to Canada for tax purposes by buying the Canadian-based Tim Horton restaurant chain. A trademark of Buffett’s tax-minimizing deals for Berkshire is buying new issues of preferred stock rather than common stock. That's what happened when General Electric, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs turned up on Buffett’s doorstep seeking both capital and Buffett’s imprimatur during and after the financial crisis. Dividends, you see, are partly tax-free for corporate recipients, even though they’re generally fully taxable for individuals. I’m not trying to imply that Berkshire’s transactions are either illegal or unethical. They’re not. The point I’m trying to make is that there’s a huge difference between the way Buffett the person handles his personal income taxes and the way Buffett the CEO handles Berkshire’s corporate income taxes. Buffett the person’s tax practices qualify him for sainthood, because among other things, his generous donations of Berkshire stock to charitable causes generate billions of dollars more in tax deductions than he will ever use. Buffett the CEO’s tax practices qualify him … to be a CEO, trying to maximize profits for his shareholders. His behavior is much better than Trump’s, because Berkshire is highly profitable and pays substantial income taxes. But Buffett the CEO is no saint — and it’s a mistake to think of him as one. business wonkblog true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

The move comes less than three months after the charitable trust that controls Hershey reached a major reform agreement with its overseer, the Pennsylvania attorney general's office, raising questions about the trust's plans for the company. The selection of the new CEO could determine not just the company's financial performance, but also whether the trust will continue to rely on Hershey as its main asset. About two-thirds of the trust's $12 billion in assets are in Hershey stock. During Bilbrey's five-year tenure as CEO, Hershey doubled its market value to $20 billion, improved its profit margins, and increased its market share in the United States to 31.3 percent from 28.3 percent. Hershey also began to diversify beyond its core confectionary business into other types of snacks. The Kisses chocolate maker said on Friday it appointed a special committee to search for a new CEO. The committee will be led by Pamela Arway, chairwoman of the board's governance committee, helped by executive search firm Egon Zehnder. The committee is considering internal and external candidates for the CEO job, and Hershey Chief Operating Officer Michele Buck is one of the contenders, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing confidential deliberations. FAMILY TIME Bilbrey will continue as non-executive chairman of the board following his retirement as president and CEO, Hershey said. The company also maintained its full-year earnings outlook. Reuters reported exclusively on Thursday that Bilbrey was preparing to step down by next summer. "All of the decisions in my career have been made in consultation with my wife, Teresa, with the impact to our children and our family being paramount. And so it is with that in mind that I have shared with our board, and now you, my decision to retire next year in order to spend more time with my family and wonderful grandchildren who have faithfully and selflessly supported me for so long," Bilbrey wrote in a note to Hershey employees on Friday. Bilbrey was named CEO of Hershey in 2011 after serving in various senior roles at the company since 2003. He added the position of chairman in 2015. Prior to Hershey, Bilbrey worked for 22 years at consumer company Procter & Gamble Co. Following an initial spurned bid in June, Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld re-approached Bilbrey in August, indicating that Mondelez would be willing to offer $115 a share, or about $24.5 billion overall, Reuters reported at the time. Hershey responded that it would not be willing to enter into deal negotiations for an offer of less than $125 per share, a source said at the time. The Hershey trust was set up by the company's founder over a century ago to fund and run a school for underprivileged children. It holds 81 percent of the company's voting stock, and so a sale is not possible without its approval. Following a dispute with the Pennsylvania attorney general over its governance policy, the trust in July agreed to expand its board to 13 members from 10, and for five members to resign by the end of the year. With one trustee having resigned shortly before that agreement, that leaves a total of nine openings. "Everybody wants clarity. The more ambiguity there is about a situation, the more difficult it is to recruit into it," said Peter Crist, chairman of recruiting firm Crist Kolder Associates, referring to the impact the turnover at the Hershey trust will have on the Hershey CEO search. Even if the trust does decide to explore a sale of Hershey, the attorney general can thwart such plans. On Friday, one of the people who agreed to resign from the trust's board by the end of the year, James Nevels, said he would not stand for re-election on Hershey's board in 2017. Nevels currently serves as Hershey's lead independent board director.

The move comes less than three months after the charitable trust that controls Hershey reached a major reform agreement with its overseer, the Pennsylvania attorney general's office, raising questions about the trust's plans for the company. The selection of the new CEO could determine not just the company's financial performance, but also whether the trust will continue to rely on Hershey as its main asset. About two-thirds of the trust's $12 billion in assets are in Hershey stock. During Bilbrey's five-year tenure as CEO, Hershey doubled its market value to $20 billion, improved its profit margins, and increased its market share in the United States to 31.3 percent from 28.3 percent. Hershey also began to diversify beyond its core confectionary business into other types of snacks. The Kisses chocolate maker said on Friday it appointed a special committee to search for a new CEO. The committee will be led by Pamela Arway, chairwoman of the board's governance committee, helped by executive search firm Egon Zehnder. The committee is considering internal and external candidates for the CEO job, and Hershey Chief Operating Officer Michele Buck is one of the contenders, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing confidential deliberations. FAMILY TIME Bilbrey will continue as non-executive chairman of the board following his retirement as president and CEO, Hershey said. The company also maintained its full-year earnings outlook. Reuters reported exclusively on Thursday that Bilbrey was preparing to step down by next summer. "All of the decisions in my career have been made in consultation with my wife, Teresa, with the impact to our children and our family being paramount. And so it is with that in mind that I have shared with our board, and now you, my decision to retire next year in order to spend more time with my family and wonderful grandchildren who have faithfully and selflessly supported me for so long," Bilbrey wrote in a note to Hershey employees on Friday. Bilbrey was named CEO of Hershey in 2011 after serving in various senior roles at the company since 2003. He added the position of chairman in 2015. Prior to Hershey, Bilbrey worked for 22 years at consumer company Procter & Gamble Co. Following an initial spurned bid in June, Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld re-approached Bilbrey in August, indicating that Mondelez would be willing to offer $115 a share, or about $24.5 billion overall, Reuters reported at the time. Hershey responded that it would not be willing to enter into deal negotiations for an offer of less than $125 per share, a source said at the time. The Hershey trust was set up by the company's founder over a century ago to fund and run a school for underprivileged children. It holds 81 percent of the company's voting stock, and so a sale is not possible without its approval. Following a dispute with the Pennsylvania attorney general over its governance policy, the trust in July agreed to expand its board to 13 members from 10, and for five members to resign by the end of the year. With one trustee having resigned shortly before that agreement, that leaves a total of nine openings. "Everybody wants clarity. The more ambiguity there is about a situation, the more difficult it is to recruit into it," said Peter Crist, chairman of recruiting firm Crist Kolder Associates, referring to the impact the turnover at the Hershey trust will have on the Hershey CEO search. Even if the trust does decide to explore a sale of Hershey, the attorney general can thwart such plans. On Friday, one of the people who agreed to resign from the trust's board by the end of the year, James Nevels, said he would not stand for re-election on Hershey's board in 2017. Nevels currently serves as Hershey's lead independent board director.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Oct 13, 2016 at 12:30PM Unilever (NYSE:UL) on Oct. 13 posted third-quarter earnings results that kept the company squarely within management's financial goals for the year. However, there were signs in the report of growing headwinds in the consumer goods industry that could threaten the company's volume-driven expansion strategy. Let's take a look at Unilever's latest operating trends. What happened this quarter? Organic growth of 3% was at the low end of the company's target range of 3% to 5% gains for the full year. Other highlights of the quarter include: Unilever grew sales at its slowest pace in over a year, with gains falling to 3% this quarter from 5% in each of the prior three quarters. Additionally, organic growth came entirely from price gains as volume declined slightly and prices rose by 4%. These figures kept Unilever ahead of rival Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), which is aiming to expand at a 2% pace this year. The company's segments are growing faster than their corresponding markets. Unilever boosted market share in each of its four product categories, with the strongest growth coming in home care. The food business posted the weakest growth pace, but still had healthy market-share gains. Geographically, sales growth sped up in the key U.S. market, was flat in Europe, and slowed in Asia and Latin America due to challenging economic and competitive conditions. What management had to say "Our business continues to demonstrate its resilience by growing competitively and consistently in tough market conditions," CEO Paul Polman said in a press release. "This was driven by strong innovations in support of our category strategies." As an example of these innovations, management cited the expansion of the Hellmann's mayonnaise brand into the popular organic segment and with the addition of new flavors like wasabi. USG = underlying sales growth. Image source: Unilever investor presentation. Executives didn't have much encouraging news to report on the industry's growth pace, though. Markets are still "soft and volatile," Polman said. Overall, "consumer demand remained weak and in the markets which we operate volumes have slowed further and are flat in aggregate," he explained. In an investor presentation Unilever noted that consumer confidence has declined through the year, and that slump is likely pressuring sales volumes. Looking forward The company reiterated its full-year growth target calling for roughly 4% organic growth. That seems achievable, given the gains in the first three quarters of the year. Meanwhile, investors can look for Unilever to ramp up its cost-cutting initiative over the next few quarters in a bid to boost profit margin even if overall sales remain flat. Unilever is happy with the bolt-on acquisitions it has recently made, including Dollar Shave Club, Blueair, and Seventh Generation, and thus more of these types of purchases could be on the way. As for a growth turnaround, it isn't showing up in the data yet. In fact, further slowing could be in the cards. Sales volume figures will be key to watch over the coming quarters since higher prices won't be enough to keep organic growth chugging higher. Unilever aims for "volume-driven" expansion, and that didn't happen this quarter. Still, the company is on track to hit management's broad targets of market-share growth, improved profitability, and strong cash flow even as it navigates a volatile, weakening global industry.

Tags: Marmitegate, UK, food banks, Brexit, The world has gone mad. While this may once have been the rallying cry only of the world's Victor Meldrews, it is now clearly a truth to be held as self-evident. The impunity with which mass murder is carried out in Syria, in Yemen, in Iraq. The support for a dangerous clown to become president of the United States. The tightening of the police state in Egypt. The arrest of teenagers in Saudi Arabia for flirting. The deaths of David Bowie and Prince. Bob Dylan being awarded the Nobel Prize. The march of the far-right, all across Europe. The rejection of the Colombian peace deal. The Brexit vote. And now, the Great Marmite Crisis of 2016. Marmitegate. Marmageddon. Never let it be said that the Brits can blow things out of proportion. The Brits, after all, invaded China and got everyone hooked on opium just so we could get cheap tea. In case you've missed the story spreading across British media faster than a savoury treat spreads across one's toasted crumpet, it is basically this: months after the Brexit vote, the UK government has still put forward no plan for dealing with the hugely complicated legal, constitutional, financial task of extricating the country from the European Union. This causes great uncertainty in the markets. On Wednesday, the pound fell to a level last seen when Disraeli ordered the British fleet to the Dardanelles before the Crimean war. Sterling hasn't been this weak since the lightbulb was invented. As a result, Unilever, the producer of Marmite (a yeast-extract spread on toast and one of Britain's favourite breakfast, lunch and dinner ingredients), announced that, as relative costs of production were rising, it would be raising the price of its products. Unilever is one of a handful of companies (along with the likes of P&G and Nestle) that make the vast majority of everything the average Brit consumes on a daily basis. Tesco, which holds a 28 percent market share of British grocery stores, subsequently declared that it would not pay the higher prices, and would refuse to re-stock Unilever goods. Twitter Post Panic on the streets of London. It should probably be noted that, when the pound was strong, Unilever wasn't exactly dropping its prices to bargain basement levels. It did have a turnover of $58 billion in 2015. Times aren't exactly tough at Unilever House. But as one Twitterer tweeted: If Tesco behaves like this with a giant company like Unilever, then just imagine how they're treating small farmers and producers. Philip North, bishop of Burnley, also commented: "The real story here is not Tesco v Unilever, but rising food prices and impact on the poor. Let's hope the food banks are Brexit-ready." Food bank use in the UK, incidentally, has swelled from 347,000 emergency three-day supply packs being issued in 2012 to more than one million in 2015. Twitter Post But wait, I hear you cry. What does Marmite have to do with the Middle East? The link is tenuous, I'll admit. But it is this. Marmite was once proposed as a solution to the violence plaguing the region. That's right. And in a serious meeting of serious people. No less serious people than the serious people at Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office, in fact. In 1999, the professor of lateral thinking, Dr Edward de Bono, was called in to lead a series of workshops with the UK's top diplomats. Dr de Bono promotes thinking about thinking – about deconstructing problems and coming at them from alternate angles. So far, so good. But his proposal concerning Marmite and the Middle East jarred with the would-be peacemakers. It is a lack of zinc in one's diet, he claimed, that makes men irritable and prone to violence. Put aside what you may think about decades of injustice, occupation, foreign powers carving up territory or plundering resources. Think about zinc. Zinc is present in yeast, de Bono continued. And most people in the west get plenty of zinc from bread. Twitter Post But the bread of the Middle East is made without yeast. Unleavened bread. Flat bread. Pitta bread. Khubz arabee. Sure, hummus has some zinc in it, but what's a really good source of zinc, according to the good doctor? That's right. My mate, your mate, Marmite. So send a job-lot of the stuff to Tel Aviv and Ramallah and let peace reign in the Middle East. Genius. Except for one thing. I tried it out. In my years of visiting and living and working in the region, from Bethlehem to Doha, a jar of the sticky stuff was never far from my reach, and I took great delight in introducing people to the yeasty zinc-filled wonderspread. And as my extensive and not-particularly-scientific experiments have continued, one thing has become abundantly clear. "Love it or hate it" is right. Never mind the historic role of the British in Palestine, or whether sandwich shops should stay open during Ramadan, it was Marmite that was a serious cause of division between people who would be friends under most other circumstances. And it's not as if we need more of that.   James Brownsell is Managing Editor of The New Arab. Follow him on Twitter: @JamesBrownsell Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

But Paul Polman is also staunchly anti-Brexit and put his name to a letter from Unilever bosses to workers telling them the company would be damaged by a vote to leave the EU.  It left employees in no doubt where their leaders stood: 'Unilever in the UK...would...be negatively impacted if the UK were to leave the European Union. 'We therefore hope...the UK will choose to Remain and thereby continue to play a central role in Unilever's long-term growth and prosperity.'  Mr Polman, 60, has been the CEO of Unilever since January 2009. Born and brought up in the Dutch city of Enschede, his father was the executive of a tyre company while his mother was a schoolteacher who quit her job in order to raise her family. One of six children, their household was staunchly Catholic. Mr Polman spent time studying for the priesthood in a Carmelite seminary before deciding he wanted to become a doctor. However, places to study medicine were limited and he was not picked in the lottery system at the time so he instead went on to earn a BA from the University of Groningen in 1977. Two years later he gained an MA in Economics and an MBA in Finance and International Marketing at the University of Cincinnati. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next #Marmitegate!

Then, in 2009 Mr Polman, who drives a 1964 E-Type Jaguar, was named CEO of Unilever. The business chief set a target to double its size while reducing its overall environmental footprint, arguing sustainability must be a focus in a world of finite resources. Mr Polman was once interviewed by his son Sebastian about business and gender equality Mr Polman earns £9.4million a year but says he is 'embarrassed' by his pay packet. He has said that there is an 'obscene excess in salary' handed to chief executives of businesses these days. 'I am ashamed of the amount of money I earn,' Polman told the Washington Post in an interview in 2014, when his salary was around 10million euros.  UNILEVER CHIEF'S CV 1977: BBA/BA, University of Groningen.

She has been a journalist for more than 25 years. At a University of New Brunswick lecture hall in Fredericton, adults had a chance to "seriously play" with Lego to create 3D models and unlock their creativity.  For one exercise they were all given the same six pieces of Lego to create a duck. When all the ducks were in a row, it was clear they're all different. "I think that when they first come in, they think this is another silly fad thing," said facilitator Jacqueline Lloyd Smith. Barb Hoyt and Jess Baker learned that having the same tools and the same direction doesn't mean you're going to get the same result. (Catherine Harrop/CBC) She also said that evaporates after the first 30 minutes. With a background in art therapy and business, Smith jumped on this method.  She became an official Lego trainer and has been flying around the world with the colourful blocks. She admits her company's Lego collection is massive.  "We have to rent storage," said Smith. Thinking differently The groups who've used this technique vary from a city strategizing about crime fighting, to Procter & Gamble, to the United Nations.  "We were able to make the point, at the United Nations, that we need to hear from everyone and we need everyone thinking differently if we're going to move forward and solve the problems of the world," said Smith. Everyone at the lecture as asked to create a duck out of the same six Lego pieces. (Catherine Harrop/CBC) The next instruction to the group was to build a tower. Like a seemingly straight forward office memo, it sent people in very different directions. "When we were told to build a tower, I thought of height first," said participant Seth Giberson. The majority went for stability. The University of New Brunswick sponsored the public night, and will be using the method with its own extended learning department to help them assemble a strategic plan.  Smith said it's the only type of strategic planning session where participants have passed on a coffee break. A new way to strategize Groups who’ve used this technique vary from a city strategizing about crime fighting, to Procter & Gamble, to the United Nations. (Catherine Harrop/CBC) The idea of using Lego to visualize problems was born of collaboration in 1996 among two business professors in Switzerland. Johan Roos and Bart Victor joined up with Lego Group owner Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, according to the Lego website. They were looking for new ways of visualizing and solving business problems. By 2004, Lego took it over, and eventually developed a community based model, giving groups a new way of strategizing, and giving Lego a new revenue stream.

The committee will be led by Pamela Arway, chairwoman of the board's governance committee, aided by executive search firm Egon Zehnder. The company also maintained its full-year outlook. Reuters reported exclusively on Thursday that Bilbrey was preparing to step down by next summer. "Now is the right time to begin the process of handing over the reins as CEO as it will allow me to spend more time with my family and wonderful grandchildren," Bilbrey said in a statement.The move comes less than three months after the charitable trust that controls Hershey reached a major reform agreement with its overseer, the Pennsylvania attorney general's office, raising questions about its future plans for the company. The company, which is based in the town of Hershey, Pennsylvania, has a market capitalization of around $20 billion.Bilbrey was named CEO of Hershey in 2011, after serving in various senior roles at the company since 2003. He added the position of chairman in 2015. Prior to Hershey, Bilbrey worked for 22 years at consumer company Procter & Gamble Co. Following an initial spurned bid in June, Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld re-approached Bilbrey in August, indicating that Mondelez would be willing to offer $115 a share, Reuters reported at the time.Hershey responded to that offer by stating it would not be willing to enter into deal negotiations for an offer of less than $125 per share, a source said at the time. The Hershey trust was set up by the company's founder over a century ago to fund and run a school for underprivileged children. It holds 81 percent of the company's voting stock, and so a sale is not possible without its approval. About two-thirds of its $12 billion in assets are in Hershey stock. Following a dispute with the Pennsylvania attorney general over its governance policy, the trust in July agreed to expand its board from 10 members to 13, and for five members to resign by year's end.With one trustee having resigned shortly before that agreement, that leaves a total of nine openings. Even if the trust does decide to explore a sale of Hershey, the attorney general can thwart such plans.

When pseudo-logic is everywhere, emotional marketing is what breaks through Bruce Philp || October 14, 2016 Topics Marketing, Advertising Print Email Comment Share: A “Leave” supporter celebrates as British referendum results roll in on June 23, 2016. Photo: Ray Tang/Rex/AP Baseless provocation has become big business in politics lately—take Brexit and the improbable candidacy of Donald Trump for two particularly vivid examples—and, if they have any sense, marketers are taking notes. The Donald has proven to have a particularly sick genius for whipping up a crowd, with his trademark mix of belligerent non sequitur and naked pandering. Its appeal doesn’t seem broad enough to get him elected, but it’s certainly enough to make people pay attention, and that’s a hot commodity these days. Pundits now anguish over our “post-factual democracy,” in which people’s politics aren’t rooted in principle anymore. If voters aren’t being even slightly cerebral about the destinies of nations, will they be any more so when it comes to toothpaste and canned soup? MORE CONSEQUENCES: What Brexit Could Mean for Canadian Small Businesses » That may seem like a leap, but brands have fed on the zeitgeist since forever. Ad people like to believe that they create the public’s tastes and moods (when they’re not “disrupting” them), but it’s usually more a matter of paddling around on their intellectual surfboards, searching for a cultural wave they can profitably ride to the beach. These days, though, maybe for the first time ever, they’re plying the wrong ocean. While keynote speakers bluster about awesome products, and smug digerati busily codify consumer behavior, those very consumers are developing an antagonistic distrust of objectivity, or what passes for it. We’re competing in emotional times, now, and reason has become obsolete. Though the debate over emotional versus rational advertising is as old as the martini, rationality’s days have been numbered for some time. Its origins are found in the industrial age, when the whole of corporate might was thrown at finding new consumer problems to solve. But socks can only get so white, and cabs only so easy to hail. It’s inevitable that consumers would turn their attention to more profound themes when it came to choosing brands. Marketers should have been ready for that, but nobody was ready for today’s seething frustration. This isn’t evolution, it’s insurrection. Finding it increasingly difficult to distinguish between nuance and prevarication, people are raging against even having to try. MORE EMOTIONS: A New Way to Know What Your Customers Are Thinking »  Nobler minds can ponder what this means for democracy—but marketers should still be paying attention. If there’s no distinction between claims and lies anymore, then the only truth people will trust is the one they feel. And they’ll soon bring that bias to the mall, not just the voting booth. Consider: 20 years ago, the ad campaign judged most effective in America was about the perils of switching dog food. This year, it was moms advocating for gun control. Canada’s effectiveness champ two decades ago was a new flavour of mouthwash; this year, that same gun control–campaign shared top honours with P&G, which turned buying feminine hygiene products into an act of political defiance. When pseudo-logic is everywhere, feelings are what break through. Turning a brand into a social cause is risky business. Most corporations are already short on moral authority, even before you add in the profit motive. But this is a good moment to look up from our spreadsheets and remember that consumers are human. It’s easy to criticize people for abandoning reason and making choices from the heart, especially if those choices seem bonkers. They’re not fools, though; they’ve simply fallen back on ancient instinct to cope with an over-marketed, amoral world. Which means that, if we’re not careful, claims-based advertising (30% more peanuts in every bite!) can inadvertently make things worse instead of winning people over. Ads are supposed to provoke. Even if your snack food is never going to save the world, it’s no longer an option to ignore how consumers feel about where it fits in their lives, or how they want it to. It’s no longer an option to be indifferent to their vanities, their insecurities, or their aspirations, because those things may be the last, best way to earn their attention. To coin a phrase, if we want to make advertising great again, we need to get more empathetic, not more clever.

"Cyberbullying has become prevalent in schools today, but it doesn't stop there — it is affecting our children 24/7, and as a mother of two daughters, I am acutely aware of the magnitude of this issue," said Kathryn Kane, senior director-global brand and campaigns, Norton by Symantec. At the heart of the campaign is the film, "Raise Your Voice Against Cyberbullying." Sparked by a creative concept developed by Grey San Francisco and brought to life with Chelsea House and filmmaker, Peyton Wilson, "Raise Your Voice Against Cyberbullying" aims to inspire parents to help their children address cyberbullying and overcome its effects. The film features raw accounts of real cyberbullying attacks told from the victims' point of view, and breaks the silence of cyberbullying as the victims' parents hear of the attacks for the first time. At the film's conclusion, the audience is asked to continue the conversation on social media through #RaiseOurVoices wherever cyberbullying is encountered. See film: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAGcPvygSOw October is National Bullying Prevention Month, but cyberbullying impacts families throughout the year. In fact, the 2015 Norton Cybersecurity Insights Report revealed that 27 percent of US parents felt their children were more likely to be bullied online than in the classroom. "Norton by Symantec is the world's leading consumer cyber security brand, and we want to use our leadership position to not only shed light on these very real and culturally-relevant topics, but also present people with solutions and a way to affect change. Inspiring parents to raise their voices is a simple solution that can have a massive impact," Kane added. To help parents learn more about cyberbullying, Norton created an e-book. The e-book offers an authentic look at cyberbullying, and features illustrations created by children aged 11 to 18 who have personally experienced cyberbullying. Also featured are tips to help parents recognize the signs of cyberbullying and a conversation guide to help parents start a related conversation with their children.  See e-book: http://now.symassets.com/content/dam/content/en-us/collaterals/ebook/norton-cyberbullying-guide.pdf Anti-bullying organizations such as PACER and Common Sense Media are working with Norton to activate #RaiseOurVoices wherever kids go online. Norton is also actively engaging with victims and parents on social platforms to encourage them to raise their voices via video, pictures or text.. "Norton security solutions have protected people and their devices for decades," said Milan Martin, Grey San Francisco President. "The old saying, 'sticks and stones can break my bones but names can never hurt me,' tragically, just isn't true today. We couldn't be more proud to help Norton address very real, very important issues in our world today."

Bilbrey, smiles as he stands on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York October 31, 2014. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo By Greg Roumeliotis and Lauren Hirsch Hershey Co, the chocolate maker that Oreo cookie-maker Mondelez International Inc tried to buy earlier this year, said on Friday that Chief Executive John Bilbrey would retire from his post on July 1. The company's shares were up 1.4 percent in premarket trading. Bilbrey will continue as non-executive chairman of the board following his retirement as president and CEO, Hershey said. The Kisses chocolate maker said it appointed a special committee to search for a new CEO. The committee will be led by Pamela Arway, chairwoman of the board's governance committee, aided by executive search firm Egon Zehnder. The company also maintained its full-year outlook. Reuters reported exclusively on Thursday that Bilbrey was preparing to step down by next summer. "Now is the right time to begin the process of handing over the reins as CEO as it will allow me to spend more time with my family and wonderful grandchildren," Bilbrey said in a statement. The move comes less than three months after the charitable trust that controls Hershey reached a major reform agreement with its overseer, the Pennsylvania attorney general's office, raising questions about its future plans for the company. The company, which is based in the town of Hershey, Pennsylvania, has a market capitalization of around $20 billion. Bilbrey was named CEO of Hershey in 2011, after serving in various senior roles at the company since 2003. He added the position of chairman in 2015. Prior to Hershey, Bilbrey worked for 22 years at consumer company Procter & Gamble Co. Following an initial spurned bid in June, Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld re-approached Bilbrey in August, indicating that Mondelez would be willing to offer $115 a share, Reuters reported at the time. Hershey responded to that offer by stating it would not be willing to enter into deal negotiations for an offer of less than $125 per share, a source said at the time. The Hershey trust was set up by the company's founder over a century ago to fund and run a school for underprivileged children. It holds 81 percent of the company's voting stock, and so a sale is not possible without its approval. About two-thirds of its $12 billion in assets are in Hershey stock. Following a dispute with the Pennsylvania attorney general over its governance policy, the trust in July agreed to expand its board from 10 members to 13, and for five members to resign by year's end. With one trustee having resigned shortly before that agreement, that leaves a total of nine openings. Even if the trust does decide to explore a sale of Hershey, the attorney general can thwart such plans.

In the role, Reid will lead creative across Deep Focus’s client roster, which includes Nestlé, Frito-Lay, eBay, Intel and Purina, while reporting directly to CEO Ian Schafer. “John’s unique mix of traditional and digital brand-building experience makes him well-positioned to further establish Deep Focus as a world-class integrated creative agency,” Schafer said in a statement, adding that he sees Reid’s hire as a turning point and that Deep Focus has begun to compete more directly with “traditional” agencies for new business — especially over the past year. Schafer said: “There are instances where we’ve been brought on as a social agency and ended up as lead creative agency. It seems like everything is up for grabs to everyone in many cases as long as you meet the minimum requirements. … The RFPs we’ve been getting over the past year have been vaguer than ever before, and I see that as an opportunity.” Reid fills a role left vacant since Engine Group spun off Deep Focus’ content creation studio, Moment Studio, as a separate Engine Group unit with Ken Kraemer serving as CEO. “It’s been quite a long journey in hiring someone [to replace Kraemer],” Schafer told Adweek. “We’re happy to have found the right person.” Reid has served as executive vice president, chief creative officer for Wunderman since July of 2010, working with clients including P&G, Audi, Campbell’s V8, E*Trade, the Ad Council, AARP, BMO Harris Bank, Johnson and Johnson and Land Rover. Before joining Wunderman he served short stints as a creative director with ATTIK, working with Toyota, TiVo, Lucas Arts, OnLive, Ubisoft and HBO, and a freelance creative director with CP+B before that, working with Microsoft, American Express, Best Buy, Burger King and Coke Zero. Prior to that he spent over six and half years as a vice president, associate creative director with McCann Erickson, where he worked with Microsoft, HP, the Oakland A’s, Nortel, and AMD. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Bilbrey smiles as he stands on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 31, 2014. (© Lucas Jackson / Reuters) Hershey CEO Bilbrey to retire in July, stay as non-executive chairman Add to ... Greg Roumeliotis and Lauren Hirsch Reuters Published Friday, Oct. 14, 2016 7:46AM EDT Last updated Friday, Oct. 14, 2016 7:48AM EDT Comments AA Hershey Co, the chocolate maker that Oreo cookie-maker Mondelez International Inc tried to buy earlier this year, said on Friday that Chief Executive John Bilbrey would retire from his post on July 1. Bilbrey will continue as non-executive chairman of the board following his retirement as president and CEO, Hershey said. The company said it had created a special committee to search for a new chief executive. Reuters reported exclusively on Thursday that Bilbrey was preparing to step down by next summer. The move comes less than three months after the charitable trust that controls Hershey reached a major reform agreement with its overseer, the Pennsylvania attorney general’s office, raising questions about its future plans for the company. Bilbrey is stepping down to spend more time with his family, a person familiar with the matter had told Reuters. The company, which is based in the town of Hershey, Pennsylvania, has a market capitalization of around $20-billion. Bilbrey was named CEO of Hershey in 2011, after serving in various senior roles at the company since 2003. He added the position of chairman in 2015. Prior to Hershey, Bilbrey worked for 22 years at consumer company Procter & Gamble Co. Following an initial spurned bid in June, Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld re-approached Bilbrey in August, indicating that Mondelez would be willing to offer $115 a share, Reuters reported at the time. Hershey responded to that offer by stating it would not be willing to enter into deal negotiations for an offer of less than $125 per share, a source said at the time. The Hershey trust was set up by the company’s founder over a century ago to fund and run a school for underprivileged children. It holds 81 per cent of the company’s voting stock, and so a sale is not possible without its approval. About two-thirds of its $12-billion in assets are in Hershey stock. Following a dispute with the Pennsylvania attorney general over its governance policy, the trust in July agreed to expand its board from 10 members to 13, and for five members to resign by year’s end. With one trustee having resigned shortly before that agreement, that leaves a total of nine openings. Even if the trust does decide to explore a sale of Hershey, the attorney general can thwart such plans. The trust put Hershey up for sale in 2002, and the attorney general’s office successfully petitioned a court to block the offer amid local community protests. Pennsylvania attorney general Kathleen Kane stepped down this summer following a criminal conviction. She was succeeded by her deputy, Bruce Castor, and the post is up for election in November.

The move comes less than three months after the charitable trust that controls Hershey reached a major reform agreement with its overseer, the Pennsylvania attorney general's office, raising questions about its future plans for the company. Hershey's board of directors is already preparing for the resignation of CEO John Bilbrey, and has formed a committee to find a successor, the people said. Bilbrey is stepping down to spend more time with his family, one of the people said. He plans to remain non-executive chairman on Hershey's board, that person added. Bilbrey was named CEO of Hershey in 2011, after serving in various senior roles at the company since 2003. He added the position of Chairman in 2015. Prior to Hershey, Bilbrey worked for 22 years at consumer company Procter & Gamble Co.

The campaign, executed on behalf of Revlon, will benefit from indaHash's unique ability to automate collaboration between brands and digital influencers. Setting momentum for great digital moments The campaign marks the beginning of an exclusive, strategic South African partnership between MediaCom’s content division, MediaCom Beyond Advertising (MBA) and indaHash. Because indaHash will be exclusively distributed through MediaCom in South Africa, all agencies and advertisers have the opportunity to utilise this unique technology through the MBA division. Joanna Pawluk The first South African campaign involved the marketing of Revlon’s Great Moments competition. The influencers were asked, through the indaHash app, to select one of the prize holidays, take a photo of the indispensable items they would take along for an expedition and add Revlon deodorant to the picture. Additionally, influencers will tell their followers about the competition and encourage them to participate. The competition runs until 31 October 2016. Large influencer stable With an international platform that is fully automated, indaHash revolutionises the process of collaboration between brands and digital influencers. It was established at the beginning of 2016 and has since gathered over 65,000 influencers, steadily captured new markets and executed more than 200 campaigns for some of the world’s biggest brands, such as Coca-Cola, P&G, McDonald’s, and L’Oréal. Federico Dedeu For indaHash, Joanna Pawluk will be responsible for the development and launch of the platform in the South African market, while Mediacom Beyond Advertising will be represented by Federico Dedeu. Advertisement Dedeu, head of MBA, says, “The company is excited to be partnering with indaHash, as it is going to revolutionise the way brands are able to work with influencers. We have been consistently seeing the true value of this marketing method. The technology enables brands to easily work with one or 100 influencers at a time, as it manages the contracts and the different payment models. This means that budgets can work harder than ever before. Over and above this, brands retain the rights to the assets created by the influencers, which have production cost savings.” Pawluk, managing partner at indaHash, adds that in the case of South Africa, indaHash decided to enter the market with a different business model. “Instead of building a local team, we decided on a strategic partnership with MediaCom.” ‹    Like Save Email Print PDF Advertisement Comment on thisComment Comment guidelines and disclaimer LEGAL DISCLAIMER: This Message Board accepts no liability of legal consequences that arise from the Message Boards (e.g. defamation, slander, or other such crimes).

But the two millionaire men behind 'Marmitegate' are no strangers to each other.  They are both very familiar with the workings of Unilever, having both worked at the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company for a combined total of almost 35 years. After more than 27 years at the £2billion firm, Dave Lewis, 51, moved over to Tesco to take up his current role as chief executive, while Paul Polman, 60, filled the vacant spot as CEO at Unilever in 2009. Yesterday, they spent the day negotiating the terms of a 10 per cent price hike which Unilever wanted to impose on supermarkets, blaming a post-Brexit era. The tumultuous day ended with Tesco coming out on top after it landed a 'satisfactory' response when Unilever backed down following a threat to boycott. Here, we put the two firms' top bosses and their successful careers head-to-head. Paul Polman, 60, chief executive of Unilever Paul Polman, 60, chief executive of Unilever Pay: £9.3million Company: Makes brands including Marmite and Colman's Mustard. Profits of £6.5billion with 2billion people in 190 countries using its products every day. Family: Married to Kim Polman, with three children. Background: Born and raised in Enschede, Netherlands, with three brothers and two sisters. Father was a tyre company executive and his mother was a teacher. Graduated from the University of Groningen with a BA, before gaining an MA in economics and an MBA in finance and international marketing at the University of Cincinnati. Career history: Held top jobs at rivals Procter & Gamble and Nestle before joining Unilever in 2009. Won a number of awards for charity work and conservation, and is president of a charity for blind African children. What he said on Brexit: Mr Polman signed the infamous letter of 200 bosses who backed Remain. He, along with former chief executives Patrick Cescau and Niall FitzGerald and ex-chairman Sir Michael Perry also sent a joint letter to employees, saying: 'We therefore hope that in the interests of Unilever, the UK, Europe, and indeed the wider global economy, the UK will choose to Remain.' Warned of 'serious consequences' of Brexit, saying price of products like Wall's Magnum ice cream would rise. 'Undoubtedly if the UK were to Leave, the conditions will not be as good as if they stay in,' he said. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next The great Marmite scam: Shame on Unilever for exploiting...

(Photo: Kelly Wilkinson / IndyStar)Buy Photo Story Highlights Kellogg’s Tour of Gymnastics Champions, 7 p.m., Saturday, Bankers Life Fieldhouse Simone Biles could be the poster child for multiple causes or issues. Among them, as it turns out, is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Hackers who broke into the database of the World Anti-Doping Agency revealed last month that the gymnast was approved for a therapeutic use exemption (TUE) for ADHD medication. There was nothing extraordinary in that. Nor did Biles violate any doping regulations. Taking such medicine “is nothing to be ashamed of, nothing that I’m afraid to let people know,” Biles posted on Twitter. In another post, she said she has taken such medicine since she was a child and that she has “always followed the rules.” The 19-year-old Biles, coming off four gold medals at the Rio Olympics, is the megastar of the Kellogg’s Tour of Gymnastics Champions that includes Saturday’s 7 p.m. show at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. To promote the tour, she agreed to a recent phone interview with IndyStar. Conditions of the interview were that she not answer questions about ADHD or about the IndyStar investigation into USA Gymnastics’ handling of cases alleging sexual abuse. Having ADHD, and taking medicine for it is nothing to be ashamed of nothing that I'm afraid to let people know.— Simone Biles (@Simone_Biles) September 13, 2016 Diagnoses of ADHD have increased significantly in recent years. According to the American Psychiatric Association, about 5 percent of American children have ADHD. The condition is not unusual among athletes. Michael Phelps was diagnosed with it, as was baseball slugger Kyle Schwarber. Perhaps Biles will elaborate in her autobiography, “Courage to Soar,” written with author Michelle Buford. The book is to be released Nov. 15. Biles said she was motivated to tell her own story rather than people reading about her on the Internet. “Words can get twisted,” she said. “I just want them to hear it from me.” Buy Photo FILE – Simone Biles performs moves in a floor exercise during a practice session for the P&G Gymnastics Championships at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, Aug.12, 2015.  (Photo: Kelly Wilkinson / IndyStar) Her post-Rio lifestyle has been dizzying. She said after the last gymnastics event there, the gymnasts packed and left immediately for “media stuff.” She did not witness any other sports. She claimed to be the klutz of the “Final Five” – members of the final national team assembled by Martha Karolyi – in pin trading. “I swear, it’s like another Olympic sport,” Biles said. “They’re just so quick and fast. They all get to everybody before me.” She said she did meet Usain Bolt in the dining hall. Upon returning to America, she met celebrities such as Beyonce, Kim Kardashian and Usher, and she filmed a music video with Jake Miller. The Final Five had what was essentially a private audience with President Obama on the Olympians' visit to the White House. Biles often awakens not knowing where she is in during the 36-city tour that opened Sept. 15 and continues through Nov. 13. The troupe is in Chicago and Milwaukee on the two nights before Indianapolis and in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Sunday. INDIANAPOLIS STAR Simone Biles wins third straight gymnasitcs all-around title She competed in Indy 14 months ago in the P&G Championships, her final U.S. competition before the Olympic year. She said she doesn’t “remember too much” from that because all the meets pass so quickly. Biles became the first gymnast ever to sweep major all-around titles in an Olympic quadrennium: three world championships and the Olympic gold medal. Surprisingly, she said the worlds were “more nerve-wracking to me than the Olympics.” The Americans were so prepared for Rio, she said, that it felt like another meet. She has not ruled out a return to the Olympics at Tokyo in 2020 but is taking a break from training. The 2017 worlds will be at Montreal next October.

By Roger Baird October 13, 2016 18:40 BST From left: Tesco CEO Dave Lewis, Unilever CEO Paul Polman were fighting for control of the prices of household brandsReuters Marmite-maker Unilever said its stalemate with the country's biggest supermarket Tesco has now been settled. The country's largest grocery manufacturer said: "Unilever is pleased to confirm that the supply situation with Tesco in the UK and Ireland has now been successfully resolved." The two firms had rowed over price and the logjam this week led to household staples such as Marmite, PG Tips tea and Dove soap disappearing from supermarket shelves. Unilever said: "We have been working together closely to reach this resolution and ensure our much-loved brands are once again fully available. For all those that missed us, thanks for all the love." However, details of their agreement were not released. The row blew up when Anglo-Dutch household goods giant Unilever is understood to have raised wholesale prices by 10% for supermarket Tesco to cover the rising costs of goods made aboard since June's Brexit vote, which has seen the pound fall almost 18%. But Tesco, which has a 28% share of the UK grocery market, has refused to pay, resulting in Unilever ending supplies of hundreds of its brands to the supermarket. The supermarket began to remove scarce items from its website earlier this week – such as Ben & Jerry's ice-cream and Marmite – and it is now leaving empty spaces on its shelves. A Tesco spokesperson had said the group was "currently experiencing availability issues". Unilever chief financial officer Graeme Pitkethly said yesterday (12 October) the group was lifting wholesale prices in Britain. He said: "In the UK, which accounts for 5% of turnover, prices should start to increase to cover the cost of imported goods due to weaker sterling." He said he was confident that the dispute with Tesco will be "resolved very quickly", adding that other Unilever customers have already accepted the price rises. Other UK supermarkets remain quiet on this issue. Pitkethly spoke as the global group posted its third quarter sales, which saw underlying sales rise 3.2% in the period, with total sales hitting €13.4bn (£12.bn, $14.8bn). MPs condemn Unilever over excuse MPs condemned Unilever, saying the company was using Brexit as an excuse to exploit consumers, and warned it may be damaging its brand. Conservative MP, and Leave campaigner, Sir Gerald Howarth said it will be very damaging to the firm's reputation "if they seek to use the fall in the pound to exploit the consumer". A jar of Marmite, one of the Unilever products which has been removed from Tesco's website amid price disputeBen Stansall/ AFP However, Unilever chief executive Paul Polman warned back in June that a vote to leave the EU's single market would increase prices for consumers. He said a hard Bexit would mean hikes in import duties on items such as dairy products, leading to price rises that would affect consumers. But last week Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis signalled he was limbering up for a fight with suppliers who tried to use the falling pound to drive through price increases. Lewis said many suppliers failed to pass on currency benefits to consumers when sterling was on the way up, and that he was "uncomfortable" with efforts to raise prices on the way down. Lewis, 51, is well-placed to know how Unilever is likely to react, because the Yorkshireman worked at the manufacturer for almost three decades until he took the helm at Tesco in 2014. He worked across a range of food and beauty units, and picked up the moniker 'Drastic' Dave along the way, as he became known as a ruthless cost-cutter. At Tesco he restored the supermarket giant to full-year £162m pre-tax profit this year after it had posted one of the biggest losses in UK corporate history, sending it £6.4bn into the red in 2015. Lewis did this by selling off a range foreign and non-core units and focusing on the key UK business. Unilever's green Dutchman Polman, 60, worked at some of the largest firms on the globe – America's P&G and Switzerland's Nestle – before the Dutchman took the helm at Unilever in 2009. One of his first acts was to cut full reporting to the stock market every quarter to encourage a long-term perspective. Under him the company pledged to eliminate coal from its energy usage within five years, and derive all of its energy solely from renewable sources by 2030. But he has kept a firm eye on the bottom line. The business saw pre-tax profits slip 8% to €7.2bn last year, but the group's total shareholder return during Polman's time in the hot seat has risen by 203%, above most of its peers. A collision of a number of factors led the two largest firms in UK food manufacture and retailing to publicly square up to each other. The major supermarkets – Sainsbury's, Tesco, Asda and Morrisons – have been locked in a fierce price war with discounters such as Aldi and Lidl for the last four years. The battle has seen grocers cut prices to win market share, which in turn gives them greater pricing power when they negotiate with suppliers. Brexit effect The rise of discounters and largely stagnant household budgets since the financial crisis has seen shoppers increasingly prepared to use own-label brands, over household brands. Finally, the plunge in the value of sterling since Brexit, as long-term investors wait for signs of the UK's new global trading arrangements, is the final element in this cocktail. Unilever's Ben & Jerry's ice-cream is one of a number of products at short supply at TescoReuters Liberal Democrats leader Tim Farron said in a column for IBTimes UK: "The row between Unilever and Tesco is the first sign that the huge and damaging costs of Brexit are beginning to feed through to the real economy." Petrol could be the next sector where Brexit hits the real economy. Chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association Brian Madderson warned earlier this week that motorists could expect increases of up to 5p per litre by the end of the month, unless there are favourable corrections to exchange rates or oil prices. Two gorillas fight it out The war of words that Tesco and Unilever were engaged in was symbolic of changes that are happening across the high street, said Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein. Monteyne said: "This isn't about Tesco or Unilever but about all UK retailers and suppliers." Hargreaves Lansdown senior analyst Laith Khalaf added: "This pricing spat is likely to be the thin end of the wedge when it comes to relationships between UK retailers and their suppliers, in light of the pressures now applied by weaker sterling." "It also doesn't bode too well for consumers, who may soon face higher prices if retailers can't entirely defray the higher costs of imports." The details of stand-offs like this often involve a three-way compromise where margins are sliced at manufacturers and retailers and higher prices are passed on to customers. This move will feed into fears that Brexit will see a range of prices drift higher until the UK arrives at more settled trading arrangements.

Through the Braun India Fashion Week London event consumers will have access to a whole host of NEWGEN and fusion designers set to take this year's catwalk ramp by storm and raise the profile of British Asian fashion couture. Confirmed international designers fresh off the ramp from Lakme Fashion Week in India include Shantanu & Nikil, Swapnil Shinde and Bhumika & Jyoti. Zbyszek Kalenik, Communications Manager of Braun said, "As a business we strive to bring a fusion of design and function to all of our products, so a partnership with Indian Fashion Week London -a platform for brands with a shared ethos -is a natural step for the brand. We are thrilled to be catwalk-side supporting the latest trends and innovation across fashion and beauty within the market and proud to offer our beauty and grooming expertise throughout the event." Manny Singh, founder of the National Asian Wedding Show said, "Historically Eastern fashion has played second fiddle to a British Asian audience who have been heavily influenced by the west, but with the growth of western brands in India and mainstream British retailers introducing eastern tones and styles in their collections, we've discovered a host of designers who understand their collections need to be designed for a western mainstream audience. Gone are the days where an outfit can only be worn for one occasion, designers are producing outfits that can be mixed and matched with other garments and have the longevity in a more mainstream wardrobe. Braun India Fashion Week London will bring these designers to the forefront and will educate the UK consumer about fresh, couture and fusion designs, whether they are Asian or not." The events will take place at ExCel London on the 14th, 15thand 16th of October 2016, with closed door fringe events taking place across Central London.

Arrayent Inc., the consumer IoT platform chosen by trusted brands, announced today that it has received EU-U.S. Privacy Shield certification with the U.S. Department of Commerce. Arrayent worked with TRUSTe to review and verify that its data privacy management practices meet the new Privacy Shield EU data transfer privacy framework. TRUSTe will also provide independent dispute resolution services to address privacy related questions from users and ongoing access to privacy guidance through the TRUSTe Global Privacy Solutions team. Arrayent is the first consumer IoT platform to achieve the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield certification. "Protecting the privacy of consumers and the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield is of critical importance to our customers, which are global consumer products brands. Our Privacy Shield certification, verified by TRUSTe, provides further validation of our commitment to consumer privacy and that we have strong solutions in place for data protection and compliance of the laws," said Cyril Brignone, CEO of Arrayent. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework was implemented by the U.S. Department of Commerce and European Commission to provide EU and U.S. companies with a clear framework to comply with more stringent criteria to protect the personal data of Europeans in the collection, use and transfer of EU customer or employee data to non-EU nations. Arrayent has added the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield certification to its adherence to the Safe Harbor Act. TRUSTe follows a three-phase process to prepare companies for their Privacy Shield Certification using a combination of experienced privacy analysts, proven assessment methodology, and powerful Assessment Manager technology platform. Phase I includes a comprehensive review of the companies privacy practices versus the Privacy Shield standards and creation of a detailed privacy finding report. Phase II includes a collaborative review of the privacy findings and the implementation of remediation recommendations. Phase III includes activation of the dispute resolution service and access to privacy guidance along with the privacy findings report in Assessment Manager to support ongoing privacy compliance. TRUSTe CEO Chris Babel said, "We believe a strong data privacy management program is critical for companies to build customer trust and ensure privacy compliance. Arrayent is among early adopting companies of Privacy Shield that have chosen to go to the next step and partner with TRUSTe to help ensure they meet the Privacy Shield framework requirements and can demonstrate their privacy commitment to users, partners, and regulators."

The company will use the capital to strengthen its technology infrastructure and team. It will also expand its services to more cities across the country, Mansi Zaveri, founder and chief executive of Kidsstoppress, told Techcircle. Launched in 2011, Kidsstoppress (KSP), owned and operated by Kidsstoppress Media Pvt Ltd, connects parents to brands, services, and events for children through its online platform. Currently, it offers its services across Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune. In addition to the website, it manages a host of properties such as KSP Code, a loyalty and exclusive access card for parents to buy kids products and services from its partnering brands; KSP Awards, a popular choice awards for brands and services in the parenting and baby care segment; KSP Kids Book Club; KSP TV, a platform that discusses topics of relevance to parents and KSP Radio, a digital radio station that shares bite size news for kids. “The parenting and baby care segment in India is a very large opportunity and is worth close to $25 billion. At the same time, it is also fragmented and very local in terms of language, culture and geography. At Kidsstoppress.com, we have built the groundwork to address this large opportunity across segments including content and market place,” Zaveri said. She said the startup is also running a beta trial of a curated marketplace model for parenting and kid products, helping parents discover products on the Kidsstoppress platform. “Kidsstoppress is working on a number of new initiatives including a curated market place model and strengthening the technology backbone to provide a very personalised experience to the parents,” Zaveri said. The delivery of the products discovered on the platform will be managed by the marketplaces they are sourced from. Apart from the commission it plans to charge for the upcoming curated marketplace services, Zaveri said the startup enjoys a host of other revenue streams including advertising, engagement and subscription. It also generates revenue from its partnerships with global brands in the baby care and parenting segment including Unilever, P&G, Himalaya Babycare and Johnsons India, among others. In the parenting space, several startups have come up in India over the last few years, including BabyCenter, BabyChakra, Parentune, ZenParent, ParentEdge, KIDSS (Kid Social Shell) and MyCity4Kids. A few startups in the baby-care and parenting space have also raised funding recently. Last month, Bengaluru-based parenting social network TinyStep raised a fresh round of funding from ecommerce major Flipkart. In May, social networking mobile app for baby-care and parenting ParentLane had raised an undisclosed amount in angel funding from a clutch of investors led by Sujeet Kumar, former president (operations), Flipkart. In March, mobile app Babygogo that connects parents with child healthcare experts, had raised Rs 2 crore ($300,000) in a seed funding round led by angel investor Rajul Garg . Prior to that, Bengaluru-based parenting app BabyBerry had secured $1 million (Rs 6.8 crore) in angel funding from industrialist Nitin Bagmane and a few undisclosed investors. Like this report?

Unilever is asking its top grocery retailers here for price increases of 10% on average, according to people familiar with the matter.

The maker of Magnum ice cream and Dove shampoo posted third-quarter sales growth on an underlying basis--which strips out the impact of acquisitions, disposals and exchange-rate changes--of 3.2%, down from 5.7% growth in the same period a year earlier. Revenue climbed 3.4% at constant currency as the company offset volume declines with higher prices. But including a negative currency impact of 3.4%, revenue was flat at EUR13.4 billion ($14.8 billion). Profit figures weren't disclosed. The results come as the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant has been grappling with a slump in the pound following Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Unilever's products were unavailable on British grocer Tesco PLC's website as of Wednesday after Unilever demanded Tesco raise prices and the grocer refused, according to a person familiar with the standoff. Unilever Chief Executive Paul Polman described global markets as "soft and volatile," calling out currency devaluation in Latin America as having squeezed disposable income. Unilever has adopted so-called "zero-base budgeting" or justifying each year's expenses from scratch to rein in costs as it works to mitigate the impact of a turbulent macroeconomic environment. On an underlying basis, Unilever reported sales growth in emerging markets weakened to 5.6% from 8.4% a year earlier. In developed markets, underlying sales growth was flat compared with 2.1% rise a year earlier. The company has made a string of U.S.-focused acquisitions in recent months that pit it squarely against rival Procter & Gamble. Last month it agreed to buy Seventh Generation Inc., a maker of plant-based detergents and household cleaners, and in July it said it was buying Dollar Shave Club, an e-commerce business that sells disposable razors and other grooming products. Unilever has also been pushing deeper into personal-care products such as shampoos and deodorants that appeal globally, and away from slower-growing food brands. But on Thursday the company said "intense competition" in many of its markets had squeezed growth in its personal-care arm. Revenue climbed 3.1% on an underlying basis, which is half the growth level reported a year earlier. The home-care and refreshments divisions performed better, logging underlying sales growth of 3.9% and 4.5% respectively. The food arm reported 1.7% growth, helped by cooking products in emerging markets and organic dressings. But Unilever's spreads business--which mainly consists of margarine--continued to decline in both North America and Europe. The company has faced pressure from analysts and investors to sell the declining business but has so far refused, saying it hasn't received an acceptable offer.

Oct 13th 2016, 9:00 AM 18,345 Views 29 Comments Share15 Tweet Email EIGHT WEEKS HAVE passed since that, heartbreaking, almost unspeakable, day in Rio. Life has moved on, but even time is acting as a slow healer for Katie Taylor as she comes to terms with it all; the disappointment, the dejection, the reality that three of the titles she held for so long are no longer in her possession. Taylor shows her emotion after defeat in Rio. Source: INPHO/Dan Sheridan It has been a tough year. Taylor’s aura of invincibility has been pierced by the unfathomable loss of form which has seen her suffer three defeats. European, World and Olympic gold all slipped out of her grasp in the space of five months. Digesting that fact cannot be easy to swallow, particularly as the hard questions need to be asked and there is a growing consensus that her powers, now that she’s hit 30, are on the wane. But Taylor is, as her CV will remind us, a champion. No matter how big, or unexpected, the fall, champions will always find a way back. “That’s life,” she tells The42. “I took a few weeks off for a nice family holiday, a quiet time to reflect. “There’s no joy in losing fights and I think everyone knows how much the Olympic Games mean to me. I had to reflect on what happened. The emotion of the whole year really.” All those emotions poured out during the heart-wrenching interview she gave to RTÉ in the immediate aftermath of her defeat to Finnish veteran Mira Potkonen. The anguish was written all over her face, a tearful Taylor barely able to find the words to describe her third defeat of what turned out to be a turbulent, and nightmarish, year. Taylor vowed to come back stronger after the Olympics and has returned to training. Source: INPHO/Dan Sheridan Even now, she can’t quite describe what happened. It’s not that she doesn’t care to think about it but the Bray native can’t bring herself to relive it. “I haven’t actually watched the fight back no,” Taylor continues. “I don’t really want to. I don’t think I’ll watch that one back. I don’t think I’ll ever watch it back to be honest. It’s such a big competition for me so the disappointment will live with me for the rest of my life. “I would look at my own performance rather than the performance of the judges as well. I shouldn’t have made the fight so close in the first place, although the judging was very corrupt over there and everyone knows that.” Upon her return from Rio, Taylor was heartened by the support of her local community and found solace in her strong religious faith during those days of doubt. After a difficult summer, there was always a light at the end of it all. “It’s not the end of the world,” she admits. “I’ve just had to pick myself back up and get on with it really. I was really encouraged by the letters of support I received. They really lifted me. “There’s nothing you can do about what happened and you just have to be positive about the situation. I was in America for a few weeks training and it went really well. I have to concentrate on what’s next.” At the moment, the next challenge comes in the form of the EUBC European Championships in Sofia next month; although whether she competes in Bulgaria remains uncertain. Katie Taylor visited Scoil Iosef Naofa in Corville, Roscrea yesterday as part of P&G’s Thank You Mum campaign. Source: Brian Gavin A decision needs to be made, or at least announced, on her future as Taylor contemplates the option of turning professional for the last years of a glittering career. The lure of the pro-ranks has previously led her to suggest it was most likely after Rio but it remains to be seen whether she will commit to another Olympic cycle or not. “I’m just weighing up all my options at the moment and I’m considering the pro game as well,” Taylor explained. “I haven’t made any decision as of yet but I’m definitely looking at every avenue. I’m speaking to a few promoters as well but I’m in no rush, I’m taking my time because it’s obviously a huge decision for me. “The pro-game is an option at the moment but I do love the Olympic Games. As I said, I am weighing up everything.” Many of her Olympic team-mates, including Michael Conlan and Paddy Barnes, have already jumped ship but you get the sense that Taylor is also eager to set the record straight and not walk away on these terms. “It’s been a disappointing year but I hope people don’t think I’m on the way down, the best is definitely yet to come from me whether that’s in the pro game or amateur game. “The fights I have lost this year were very questionable as well so I do feel like I’m the best female boxer in the world. I feel like I can be on top for the next few years and I am very, very motivated anyway. “What happened doesn’t define who I am. The best is yet to come.” The42 is on Snapchat!

Published on October 13, 2016 at 1:00 am Last update on October 13, 2016 at 1:23 am By Will Clark The Board of Regents approved a $1.46 million budget Tuesday for a branding initiative in which the UT System will partner with creative agencies to better unite the UT System brand. Teri Thompson, chief marketing officer for the UT System, explained the goal of the initiative is to enrich and complement the branding activities of UT’s 14 different institutions so everyone from donors to parents of prospective students understands the power of the UT System. “We have amazing institutions that are doing amazing things, individually,” Thompson said. “But imagine the lift we could get if we also talk at the same time about what’s going on collectively.” The Regents voted unanimously with one abstention at their most recent meeting, approving the plan and $1.46 million for a one-year contract with sister agencies GSD&M and Interbrand, which are both owned by Omnicom. The partnership between the agencies creates a single-stop solution for this challenge, and a critical step will be listening to students, faculty and other key stakeholders to understand which approach makes the most sense, according to GSD&M CEO Duff Stewart. “I think we want to move away from being a family of brands to really a branded family,” Stewart said. “That shows the power of the institution. I don’t know how that comes to life in the articulation because we’ve got to talk to the people that are deeply immersed in the day-to-day.” Austin-based GSD&M created the UT motto “What starts here changes the world,” and coined the phrase “Don’t Mess With Texas” for an anti-litter ad campaign. Stewart said the initiative’s return on investment will be recognition of the strength and power of the UT System. “It’s not that we’re 14 institutions,” Stewart said. “It’s that when you have the strength of the people and the strength of the character of those institutions, together they form a very powerful institution: the University of Texas System.” According to Thompson, the plan will draw from brand models such as the NFL, Procter & Gamble, The Hershey Company and other university systems. Randa Safady, vice chancellor for external relations for the UT System, oversaw the creation of this plan and said she understands these institutions are highly differentiated and have a unique character. “That’s very important to us,” Safady said. “We should not and will not attempt to interrupt it by any of our proposed branding activities.” View the discussion thread.
