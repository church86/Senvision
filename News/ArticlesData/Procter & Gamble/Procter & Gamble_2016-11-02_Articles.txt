Promotions are under the microscope at top consumer goods companies like P&G, where they are starting to question if the balance has tipped too far in discounting’s favor, according to a recent report in Marketing Week.   P&G’s chief financial officer Jon Moeller has argued that growing the business by significantly increasing promotion spending would be “a pyrrhic victory,” Marketing Week noted.   “When you talk about increasing trial and sampling at point of market entry and point of market change with noticeably superior products, that moves markets over time. And being able to price behind superior innovation also moves markets over time. What doesn’t move markets is leading the march down on promotion spending,” he said, speaking on an investor call.   While Moeller admitted there are many cases where investing in price promotion is an effective use of P&G’s funds, it is also looking to redirect its spend to other elements of the marketing mix.   “[We want to] focus back again on how we can drive market growth in our categories and how we can drive shopping trips and basket size for our retail partners. And it’s really [about] working together in a joint context to identify where those opportunities are,” he explained.   Other top brands are doing the same, reports Marketing Week. Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld recently said the company is shifting its spend by investing behind its “power brands” and putting a bigger emphasis on advertising rather than consumer promotion. Meanwhile, Unilever’s head of investor relations Andrew Stephen admitted the company is taking a closer look at its spending after the UK saw a “revised spate” of price promotions.   Marketing Week reasoned that when brands rely too heavily on price-led sales promotions, there is little space to focus on personality and differentiate from competitors.   To read the complete Marketing Week story, click here.

This was made known at the 2016 National Dental Association Continuing Medical Education (CME) in partnership with Oral B, aimed at educating dentists on oral care and to further develop the professional competencies of practicing dental care professionals. Giving the opening remarks titled ‘The Exceptional Dentist- 5 years of New Paradigm for Enhanced Productivity’, the Brand Marketing Director, P&G Nigeria, Tolulope Adedeji, stated that the company was sponsoring the CME for dentists in order to provide the necessary trends and development to promote and ensure ample support for oral care hygiene of Nigerians. Adedeji, describing dentists as critical partners of the company’s oral care brand that launched in Nigeria five years ago, said “the more dentists know, the better they also can give services to patients as they come.” She added that “to enable Nigerians access qualitative dental care, it is necessary we equip our dental care professionals on the constant innovations discovered in oral health care.” One of the highlights of the capacity building workshop was the exposure to dentists of the revolutionary and multipurpose benefits of stabilised stannous toothpastes with references to the research results on Stannous Fluoride with Nigerian patients. In the key presentation of Dr. Ayan Badejo, a foremost periodontist in Nigeria and lecturer at the Department of Preventive Dentistry, University of Lagos who was represented by Dr. Modupeore Shorunke recommended that Nigerians should buy toothpastes with anti-bacterial agents to clean their teeth, saying they are better in preventing tooth decay, tooth sensitivity and gum problems. Shorunke, an associate professor of Dentistry, LASUCOM, stated that toothpaste with anti-bacterial content were helpful in preventing bacterial plaque which irritates the gums and can lead to gum disease. According to her, “currently, over 90 per cent of patients seen in our dental clinic have some degree of gum disease across all age groups and socio-economic status. “Despite brushing every day, many people still find it difficult to maintain that level of plaque control that ensures that the gums are healthy. Just as fluoride is for prevention of tooth decay, so also, anti-bacterial toothpaste helps to kill the bacteria and plaque that causes gum disease.” Oral-B, in partnership with the Nigerian Dental Association (NDA), has benefited over 2000 dentists in Nigeria since the launch in 2011 updating them with the latest development in the field of dentistry.

(Photo/China Daily) Global household and consumer products giant Procter & Gamble Co said it is making a drive to introduce into the Chinese market more high-tech and premium hygiene products for Whisper, its female-care range, to speed up the brand's focus on more lucrative premium products. Hesham Tohamy, president of Greater China Feminine Care, said Chinese women are now very demanding about quality and are willing to pay more to get better quality. "That's why Whisper is innovating and bringing (new) technologies into every lineup of our products," he said. "Chinese consumers' expectations of high-quality products are the fastest-growing around the world," said Tohamy. He added that the company would speed up the introduction of advanced technologies and premium products in China and manufacture products tailored for Chinese clients to satisfy their ever-increasing demands. Whisper launched its foam sanitary pads in China recently. The product has adopted FlexFoam, a material that can absorb 10 times its weight in liquids and remain contoured to the human body, to eliminate leakage. The pads are currently only manufactured in Canada and Hungary. Tohamy said that for the past few years the Chinese market's needs had advanced quickly and Whisper had not always kept up but was now moving to meet that demand. "There has been a big shift in our commitment to meet but also to drive premium-quality (products) that consumers are looking for," he added. China is the fifth country to sell the new Whisper foam pads after the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Italy. The company also said it plans to increase technological innovation in its product lineup and bring out more high-end products in the future. P&G said earlier it had committed to investing in China to become more high-end in the consumer market, pushed by increased competition from other brands and premium products. The consumer group said competition had been hotting up, ratcheting up the pressure on the major players. In fiscal year 2016, the US-based consumer goods company reported a 5 percent year-on-year decline in organic sales in China, its second-biggest market. It said as a result it was set to enhance its group product portfolio with more product innovations and premium offerings. Neil Wang, president of Greater China of market research agency Frost & Sullivan, said: "With increasing living standards and more and more health consciousness in China, women have higher demands of sanitary pads for their function, comfort, safety and health requirements." The growing demand of consumers was, he said, stimulating a steady increase in the sanitary pads market. Wang added that consumers tended to buy niche brands that complied with their individual wishes and requirements, while most of P&G's products were positioned at basic requirement levels. He said that Whisper could achieve a comprehensive brand upgrade with the launch of the new pads to attract more consumers. Wang added that P&G needed to undertake more detailed analysis targeted at consumers' needs in China, focus on its core business and innovate retail channels to realize the high-end transformation of its product base.

This was made known at the 2016 Nigerian Dental Association (NDA) Continuing Medical Education (CME) in partnership with Oral B. The Oral B dental detailing programme is aimed at educating dentists on oral care and to further develop the professional competencies of practicing dental care professionals. Giving the opening remarks titled: “The Exceptional Dentist- 5 years of New Paradigm for Enhanced Productivity” at the capacity building seminar for dentists recently in Lagos, Tolulope Adedeji, Brand Marketing Director, P&G Nigeria, stated that the company is sponsoring the CME for dentists in order to provide the necessary trends and development to promote and ensure ample support for oral care hygiene of Nigerians. Adedeji, describing dentists as critical partners of the company’s oral care brand that launched in Nigeria, five years ago, said “the more dentists know, the better they also can give services to patients as they come.” She added: “To enable Nigerians access qualitative dental care, it is necessary we equip our dental care professionals on the constant innovations discovered in oral health care.” One of the highlights of the capacity building workshop was the exposure to dentists of the revolutionary and multipurpose benefits of stabilized stannous toothpastes with references to the research results on Stannous Fluoride with Nigerian patients. In the key presentation of Dr. Ayanbadejo, a foremost periodontist in Nigeria and Lecturer at the Department of Preventive Dentistry, University of Lagos who was represented by Dr Modupeore Shorunke recommended that Nigerians should be buying toothpastes with anti-bacterial agents to clean their teeth, saying they are better in preventing tooth decay, tooth sensitivity and gum problems. Shorunke, an associate professor of Dentistry, Lagos State University College of Medicine (LASUCOM), speaking at the Continuing Medical Education Seminar, stated that toothpaste with anti-bacterial content were helpful in preventing bacterial plaque which irritates the gums and can lead to gum disease. According to her, “Currently, over 90 per cent of patients seen in our dental clinic have some degree of gum disease across all age groups and socio-economic status. Despite brushing every day, many people still find it difficult to maintain that level of plaque control that ensures that the gums are healthy. Just as fluoride is for prevention of tooth decay, so also, anti-bacterial toothpaste helps to kill the bacteria and plaque that causes gum disease.” Oral-B, in partnership with the NDA, has benefited over 2000 dentists in Nigeria since the launch in 2011 updating them with the latest development in the field of dentistry and assisting them in their career growth.

Por Sharon Terlep Sharon Terlep The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiografíaSharon Terlep @sharonterlep miércoles, 2 de noviembre de 2016 19:11 EDT ENLARGE David S. Taylor, presidente ejecutivo de Procter & Gamble (P&G) Photo: Business Wire CINCINNATI-El rápido ascenso del Dollar Shave Club y los nuevos servicios en línea de ventas tomaron por sorpresa a algunos ejecutivos de Procter & Gamble Co. y sorprendieron a una industria que consideraba que Gillette, de P&G, era una marca impenetrable. Pero el presidente ejecutivo de P&G, David Taylor, no se ha inmutado. Un año después haber asumido el timón de la mayor compañía de productos de consumo del mundo, el ejecutivo de 58 años señala que las acciones de Dollar Shave Club se están “aplanando” y que el mercado de startups tiene unos nichos de clientes muy específicos. “Si usted tiene productos de rendimiento superior y comunica bien”, dijo en una entrevista, “usted tenderá a ganar con el tiempo”. En un momento en que el cambio de hábitos de los consumidores está transformando la manera en que la gente compra y en que muchos de los gigantes corporativos más arraigados del mundo se recrean a sí mismos, Taylor evita hablar de reinvención. Su objetivo es mantener a P&G en la cima mediante la puesta en juego de sus fortalezas históricas. Un veterano de 36 años de P&G, Taylor no ha buscado comprar una startup de renombre. La empresa no ha lanzado importantes nuevas marcas ni ha previsto un cambio radical en la forma en que los consumidores compran productos básicos para el hogar. Para algunos en Wall Street, la estrategia parece arrogante. El fabricante de los pañales Pampers y del detergente Tide ha estado luchando con años de crecimiento anémico y una caída en su participación de mercado. “Todo el mundo que los rodea está cambiando y quieren seguir haciendo lo que están haciendo, en algún momento todo eso alcanzará un punto crítico”, dijo el analista de Bernstein Research Ali Dibadj. “Se siente como que la arrogancia de P&G estuviera de vuelta.” De voz suave y deliberada, Taylor se presenta como lo opuesto a arrogante. Este nativo de Charlotte, Carolina del Norte, es un ex gerente de planta que se pasó a gestión de marca y se abrió camino en las filas de P&G. Sentado en su oficina en la sede de P&G, Taylor dijo que confía en que las mejores perspectivas de P&G permanezcan arraigadas en sus fundamentos. Esto significa vender a las masas a través de las grandes cadenas minoristas en base a datos del consumidor meticulosamente recogidos, una operación masiva de investigación y desarrollo y el mayor presupuesto de publicidad del mundo. P&G tiene que aprender a hacer estas cosas más rápido y con mayor eficacia, dice. “Siempre respetamos a nuestros competidores y vamos a aprender”, dijo. “A veces tenemos que fijarnos en el valor y a veces hay que fijarnos en los resultados”. Al preguntársele sobre la reciente adquisición de Dollar Shave Club por su rival europea Unilever PLC por US$1.000 millones, anunciada como una forma de Unilever de conseguir más datos de los consumidores--, Taylor señala que P&G ya tiene ingentes cantidades de datos de los consumidores y capacidad para aprovecharlos a su disposición. La cuota de mercado de Gillette ha caído un 10% desde que Dollar Shave Club llegó a la escena, pero sigue contando con cerca del 60% del mercado de EE.UU. para máquinas de afeitar para hombres. En una reciente conferencia de resultados, el director financiero Jon Moeller respondió a una pregunta acerca de las ventas directas al consumidor destacando que ese negocio es muy pequeño. “¿Cuánta gente conoce que quiera satisfacer sus necesidades de compras productos de hogar visitando 40 sitios web diferentes por 40 productos diferentes?” P&G ha experimentado con la venta directa en el pasado, como un servicio de suscripción para Tide Pods, pero no ha sido una iniciativa importante. En su primer año, Taylor ha redoblado los esfuerzos en la reducción de costos, al anunciar en febrero un plan para eliminar un adicional de US$10.000 millones en los próximos cuatro años. La compañía ha recortado más de más de 20.000 puestos de trabajo desde 2012 y vendido más de US$20.000 millones en marcas, incluyendo Duracell y CoverGirl. Gran parte de los nuevos ahorros vendrán de una reestructuración de las cadenas de suministro de la compañía en América del Norte y Europa. P&G ha cortado pérdidas de cuota de mercado en China, que Taylor describió como un resultado “inaceptable” de la insuficiencia de la compañía para mantenerse en tope de las tendencias locales. Aunque P&G está concentrando sus esfuerzos en sus dos mercados más grandes, América del Norte y China, la compañía está trabajando para reducir costos y ser más eficientes a nivel mundial. En América Latina, donde la inestabilidad política ha contribuido a varios trimestres de resultados flojos, la compañía ha comenzado recientemente a volver a trabajar para producir múltiples productos para mejorar la flexibilidad de las operaciones de fabricación. Desde que Taylor asumió el cargo, la acción de P&G ha subido un 13%. Aun así, el ejecutivo reconoce que P&G ha tenido tropiezos. La compañía continuó su expansión en la recesión y se estiró demasiado, dijo. Luego cortó la inversión en investigación y desarrollo y construcción de marca y trató de combatir la lentitud de crecimiento aumentando los precios, cediendo en el proceso cuota de mercado. “Perdimos el equilibrio y estamos tratando de volver al equilibrio”, dijo. Clave para conseguir volver a la pista, dijo Taylor, es eliminar capas de burocracia que ralentizan el proceso de creación de nuevos productos. Los ejecutivos dicen que están viendo los resultados. Un ejemplo es el nuevo jabón de lavar ecológico de la empresa, Tide Purclean. Fue concebido y llevado al mercado en nueve meses, mientras que un nuevo producto en P&G suele tardar de dos a tres años en desarrollarse. Algo que permitió ahorrar tiempo fue un nuevo proceso en el cual los líderes de las diferentes áreas de trabajan al mismo tiempo. Así que en lugar de completar la química del producto y dar el relevo al equipo que hace que las botellas, esas partes del negocio trabajan lado a lado. En un momento, Taylor intervino para atajar lo que podría haberse convertido en una larga deliberación: la determinación del color de la tapa de la botella. Al equipo le preocupaba que un casquillo naranja—el color típico de la marca— podría distraer a los consumidores del mensaje ambiental. Pero querían estar seguros de que el detergente todavía era reconocible para los clientes. Taylor le dijo al equipo que eligieran naranja. Lori Hudson, gerente de portafolio de Bahl y Gaynor en Cincinnati que ha poseído acciones de P&G, le gusta que Taylor admitió fallas en China desde P&G, “nunca pareció ser el tipo de empresa que admitía errores”. “Pero él es un veterano de P&G que puede ser bueno o malo porque las cosas han cambiado tanto en términos de lo que quieren los clientes”, dijo Hudson. “¿Es un visionario? No lo sé”.

LEAD 6 Unforgettable Lessons That Have Guided My Business Career Follow these, go forth, and succeed. By Steve Cody I'm a climber, comedian, and dog lover. But not necessarily in that order. I also happen to be co-founder and CEO of Peppercomm, a strategic communications firm headquartered in NYC, with offices in San Francisco and London. I publish RepMan, a daily blog, and have had the opportunity to appear on CNBC, MSNBC, NPR, and a host of other top-tier media over the years. scody@peppercomm.com @RepManCody Co-founder, Peppercomm@RepManCody WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Having achieved a modicum of success since beginning my career shortly after Einstein invented electricity, I've learned, or experienced, lessons that I believe will make you a better businessperson. See what you think: 1.) Patience is a virtue. Every organization has underachievers who, nonetheless, strike you as diamonds in the rough. Be patient with them. Once upon a time, I submitted a clearly inferior piece of copy but, instead of berating me, my boss took a full hour to explain where I'd missed the mark. I asked him why. He sat back and said, "Because one day you'll be in my position and spot someone who possesses the skills, but needs expert guidance. I'll expect you to treat her in exactly the same way." Great advice. 2.) Loose lips sink ships. I was the junior member of a global agency pitch team that had just won a sizable piece of P&G. As we partied on the flight home, some of us poked fun at the client decision-makers. Big mistake. Sitting directly behind us was a P&G employee. He promptly debriefed our new client who, within hours, became our erstwhile client. 3.) Lose the attitude. I'd been scoring success after success at a particular firm, and felt I was long overdue for a raise. So, I casually strolled into my CEO's office and told him so. I was lucky to escape with my life, much less my job. He gave me 24-hours to convince him why I deserved to continue drawing a paycheck. I was crestfallen. Luckily, though, I was also blessed with a superb mentor who talked me off the ledge, and helped me create a 90-day plan that highlighted past successes while outlining how I'd raise the bar in the next three months. I slinked back into the CEO's cavernous office. He reviewed my one-pager, inhaled deeply on his cigar and said, "OK, kid. You have 90 days." Once the CEO was convinced I'd lost my sense of entitlement (Note to Millennials: You did not invent entitlement), he promoted me AND gave me a raise! 4.) Don't underestimate looks. This may be politically incorrect, but sometimes first looks do make a lasting impression. Once upon a time, we were desperately trying to staff a rapidly growing account. We interviewed a guy who possessed all of the right credentials, but whose physical appearance made Nick Nolte look well-coiffed. Desperate as we were, we hired the guy and sent him to client meetings where he promptly fell asleep! Turned out his disheveled appearance resulted from his working two jobs and getting little, if any, sleep. Rather than risk the badly understaffed account, we sent Pigpen packing.

Weed out the grapevine. Rumors can kill the most successful business. Once, during a Verizon power outage, we lost all phone and e-mail service for 48 hours. This wouldn't have been such a big deal if the outage hadn't occurred in April of 2000 when 35 percent of our dotcom clients were walking out the door at breakneck speed. Since the trade media couldn't reach us, rumors began flying that we'd gone out of business. Our management team jumped on cell phones to reassure all of our constituent audiences that the exact opposite was the case, but the damage had been done (at least temporarily). I'd guess it took us a good six months to regain trust with employees, clients, prospects and the trade alike. Prepare for the unexpected and nip the grapevine in the bud. 6.) I have met the enemy and he is me. Marissa Mayer won't do it. John Stumpf wouldn't do it. And, lord knows Jeff Skilling refused to do it. "It" is admitting fault for grievous mistakes and pledging to make immediate corrections. The buck stops with you. The very best leaders assume responsibility when the sh*t hits the fan. I've accepted full responsibility for my own mistakes at least three or four times over the past two decades. These have included inadvertently naming our firm Peppercom (and attracting every dotcom under the sun). It was a beautiful thing until the tech bubble burst, so I added an "M" to our surname. I also hired 10 new staffers based upon oral promises from two clients who said they'd double their billings (neither did and we were forced to downsize). And, I've admitted countless times that my  blogs have gotten us into trouble with prospects and clients alike and, indeed, even cost us a client. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com. Published on: Nov 2, 2016 Advertisement

World Trademark Review Login Reset password Toggle navigation Home Home Magazine Blog Market intelligence Top TM professionals Research Legal updates Events International directory Media P&G targets lookalikes in its latest push to enforce Head & Shoulders brand rights 02 Nov 16 < Back to Blogs Jack Ellis Procter & Gamble (P&G) appears to be intensifying its enforcement efforts in relation to its key product brands, as it tackles another alleged violation of IP rights covering its Head & Shoulders haircare line. On Monday this week, P&G filed a lawsuit in the US Middle District of Tennessee against Vi-Jon, a manufacturer of personal care products that describes itself as “a proven leader in private brand solutions”. In the filing, P&G alleges that the packaging of some of Vi-Jon’s shampoo products – which are sold to retail chains to be marketed as private-label or ‘own-brand’ items – infringe on the trademarks and trade dress of its Head & Shoulders line of anti-dandruff shampoos and conditioners. In particular, P&G claims that Vi-Jon shampoo bottles sold in US retail chains CVS, Dollar General and Kroger “mimic the shape, colors and label of Head & Shoulders… in a way that infringes its trade dress”. Quoted in a press release, P&G’s chief legal officer Deborah Majoras said: “We invest heavily in all aspects of our product, and its appearance has become inextricably linked with what we stand for to our consumers… When a competitor makes products that come too close to our legally protected trademarks and trade dress, it’s unfair to consumers, and to our employees and shareholders, and we will challenge those violations.” This is not the first time that Vi-Jon has been accused of infringement by P&G. Back in February 2006, P&G sued the private-label manufacturer for alleged trade dress infringement, dilution and false advertising relating to its Crest Pro-Health mouthwash products. In May 2011, P&G filed trademark and patent infringement suits against Vi-Jon in the Southern District of Ohio, this time regarding packaging of a mouthwash product retailed by Target that allegedly copied its Scope Outlast branding. According to 2013 research commissioned by the UK IP Office, ‘lookalike’ private-label products account for 23% share of the groceries market across the European Union. On average, such items are 31% cheaper than ‘name-brand’ products. The research also found a “small, but statistically significant” ‘lookalike effect’ leading consumers to believe that similar-looking products share similar characteristics and origins, indicating the scale of the problem that faces brand owners. P&G’s running battle with Vi-Jon over the years demonstrates how seriously it believes private-label lookalikes impact on its business and its consumers – and it is a battle that it has waged on a global scale. Earlier this year the company took high-profile action to protect its Head & Shoulders brand from counterfeits, filing UK trademark lawsuits against discount retailer Poundstretcher and its suppliers for selling fake versions of the shampoo. It is a battle that will likely continue in today’s competitive marketplace.  Channels Brand strategy Trade dress Infringement Passing off Brand In-house issues Comments Please log in or register to leave a comment.

The combined overall revenue of selected eight MNCs during the FY 16 registered a total of $9436.66 million, whereas the combined revenue of selected seven Indian FMCG is $11066.46 Million, reveals the joint study. The highest profit after tax margin of leading Indian FMCG is maintained at 25.48% by ITC as comparative to Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Health Care among selected Leading MNC players in FMCG Sector in India, which maintained the highest profit after tax margin by 17.03% which is comparatively lower. The study has observed performance analysis of selected Indian FMCG Companies that the ITC is leading amongst others with its recorded 25.48% After Taxes Profit Margin (PAT) during the Financial Year, 2016; as its Profit After Taxes is $ 1514.57 Million against revenue of $ 5944.79 Million. While Britannia Industries stands second among other selected ones in terms of generated revenue by $1222.75 Million during the FY 2016 and has registered growth in revenue by 10.76% as comparative to FY2015, however its After Taxes Profit Margin (PAT) is 9.43% which is comparatively lower than its peers in the sector. The performance of Dabur India is next to ITC in terms of After Taxes Profit Margin (PAT) registered with 16.34% which is $ 144.54 Million against the revenue of $884.62 Million. In terms of After Taxes Profit Margin (PAT), the Godrej Consumer Products is close to Dabur India with 15.37% which is on the basis of $113.80 Million of PAT against revenue of $740.24 Million. The Marico also performed closely with that of Godrej Consumer Products as the percentage of PAT margin remained 14.19% which comes out on the basis of the disclosed figure of PAT $107.98 Million against the $761.14 Million of revenue. About the performance of Amul, although the company has revenue $743.69 Million, which is slight more than Godrej Consumer Products but the PAT margin is least amongst others having just 0.32%. In case of Amul, the reason can be the fact of controlled prices and nature of milk and milk made products. The Performance of Patanjali Ayurved has been unmatched and leaves behind all its competitors in the segment with record growth of 146.31% in the revenue on Y-o-Y basis. As the Patanjali Ayurved has achieved the revenue of $769.23 Million during FY 2016 against just $ 312.31 Million during FY 2015. After analyzing the performance of selected Multi-National Companies of FMCG Sector in India, the study has observed that the Hindustan Unilever is leading with its revenue earned $4921.10 Million with 3.84% Y-o-Y growth in the revenue. But its PAT margin during the year is $628.06 Million i.e only 12.76% which is comparatively lower than its competitor. As data analysis shows that Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Health Care is leading amongst others with its recorded 17.03% After Taxes Profit Margin (PAT) during the Financial Year 2016 because its Profit After Taxes is $ 65.10 Million against revenue of $ 382.20Million. Where the performance of Glaxosmithkline Consumer Healthcare has recorded 15.94% PAT margin for having its After Taxes Profit of $105.68 Million against Revenue of $662.88Million, the Colgate-Palmolive (India) achieved 13.85% PAT Margin with its $88.69Million against revenue of $640.35 Million. Gillette India achieved 10.19% PAT Margin for its just $32.77Million of PAT against $321.62 Million of revenue. The performance of Nestle India has declined during the FY2016 by 17.04% in the revenue achieved upto $1257.74 Million comparative to FY2015 when it was $1516.13 Million. Hence the Overall PAT margin during the year remained only 6.89%. The logic behind the data decline of Nestle India can be publicly known facts of post Maggy issue. About the performance of PepsiCo India, there is 13.00% growth in the revenue during the FY16, when it has achieved $1250.77 Million as Compared to $1106.88 Million during FY15 and thereby the company could manage to reduce the negative Profit After Taxes from $43.08 Million in FY15 to $ 27.23 Million during FY16 however, company could not make it possible to have satisfactory overall profit as there was negative PAT margin by 2.18%.

About the performance of Amul, although the company has revenue $743.69 Million, which is slight more than Godrej Consumer Products but the PAT margin is least amongst others having just 0.32%. In case of Amul, the reason can be the fact of controlled prices and nature of milk and milk made products.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News UCLA Anderson School of Management Honors Retired Boeing Chairman, President and CEO W. James McNerney, Jr., Awarded 2016 John Wooden Global Leadership Award LOS ANGELES–(BUSINESS WIRE)–UCLA Anderson School of Management honored W. James (Jim) McNerney, Jr., retired chairman, president and CEO of The Boeing Company, with the 2016 John Wooden Global Leadership Award on Nov. 2, 2016, at a banquet held at the California Science Center in Los Angeles. The award, named for legendary UCLA basketball coach, author and leadership expert John Wooden (1910–2010), is given each year to an exceptional individual in corporate America whose leadership style and service to the community reflect the same high benchmarks of performance, integrity and ethical values set by Wooden. McNerney was selected as this year’s recipient for the exceptional leadership he has displayed throughout his career at some of the world’s largest and most iconic companies, including General Electric, 3M and, most recently, Boeing, where he served as chairman, president and CEO for a decade. “It would be difficult to identify another executive who has delivered as superb results across such complex global businesses as Jim McNerney,” said UCLA Anderson Dean Judy Olian. “Whether at GE, 3M or Boeing, Jim was laser focused on culture, process and integrity – with fantastic results that followed. It’s about winning, the right way, just like Coach Wooden demonstrated in his decades of coaching and teaching.” Over the course of his career, McNerney has received numerous honors and recognitions, including being named “CEO of the Year” in 2015 by Chief Executive magazine and the 2008 National Management Association’s Executive of the Year. By appointment of U.S. President Barack Obama, he serves on the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees. He previously chaired the President’s Export Council. He serves on the board of trustees of the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, and he is a past chair and previous member of the executive committee of Business Roundtable. He also is a past chair of the US-China Business Council. He is a director of Procter & Gamble, a director of IBM, a member of The Field Museum Board of Trustees in Chicago, a trustee of Northwestern University, the chair of the Northwestern Memorial HealthCare Board and of the Kellogg School Dean’s Advisory Board. “John Wooden’s way of going about things is envious,” said McNerney. “I loved watching his teams and the way every individual found his or her potential, yet the team was the best team on the floor. I understand the connection between individual and team achievement and making it all work.” Previous John Wooden Global Leadership Honorees include: Ursula Burns (chairman and CEO, Xerox), Paul E. Jacobs (executive chairman, Qualcomm), Robert Iger (chairman and CEO, Disney), Indra Nooyi (chairman and CEO, PepsiCo), Peter Ueberroth (managing director, Contrarian Group, and president of the Los Angeles Olympics Organizing Committee), Frederick Smith (president and CEO, FedEx), Kenneth Chenault (chairman and CEO, American Express Company) and Howard Schultz (chairman, president and CEO, Starbucks). Net proceeds from the event fund fellowships for UCLA Anderson students who embody Coach Wooden’s leadership ideals and commitment to improving the lives of others. Each of the four 2016 John Wooden Global Leadership Fellows receive a $25,000 fellowship: Corey McMillen (MBA ’17) Datra Oliver (FEMBA ’18) Doug Larratt (EMBA ’17) Eric Potocek (FEMBA ’18) “One of our primary goals is to educate and develop future generations of global leaders,” said Dean Olian. “The John Wooden Global Leadership Award ceremony furthers that goal in several ways. First, the leadership examples set by both Coach Wooden and Jim McNerney serve as inspiration for all of our students. Awarding the Wooden Fellowships to our most deserving recipients assists the fellows as they pursue their own dreams and passions.” About the John Wooden Global Leadership Award As the most winning coach in men’s college basketball, Wooden’s legacy of leadership transcends athletics and spans generations. As a coach, prolific author and inspiring speaker, he dedicated his life to motivating individuals to achieve their highest potential. Wooden instilled in others a sense of pride, a commitment to ethics and a respect for teamwork. UCLA Anderson extends these fundamental principles and Wooden’s famous Pyramid of Success into the classroom through the Wooden Global Leadership Program.

The research study covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the global facial wipesmarketfor 2016-2020. To calculate the market's size, the report considers the revenue generated from the retail sales of different types of facial wipes to individual consumers. The use of facial wipes is relatively high among consumers aged 20-39 years, as this age group focuses more on personal grooming at large. Sales of facial wipes to this consumer segment generated more than 50% of the global facial wipes market's revenue in 2015. Over the coming years, vendors are expected to increase their focus on marketing initiatives that are targeted toward this age group, with an increased focus on social media platforms, which remain highly frequented by this demography. For instance, marketing campaigns such as Unilever's 'We believe in goodness' for Simple, Kimberly-Clark's 'wipe away' for KLEENEX, and Johnson Johnson's 'WipeForWater' for Neutrogena facial wipes are targeted at the youth and the middle-aged consumer segment. Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=54065 Technavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Technavio consumer and retailanalysts highlight the following three factors that are contributing to the growth of the global facial wipes market: Availability of products specific to different skin types and concerns Smaller packs and multipurpose facial wipes Increasing inclination toward all-natural facial wipes Availability of products specific to different skin types and concerns In addition to skin types, manufacturers offer facial wipes targeted at specific skin concerns such as acne/blemishes, aging skin, blackheads, fine lines/wrinkles, loss of firmness/elasticity, dark circles, dark spots, dryness, dullness/uneven texture, oiliness, pores, puffiness, redness, and uneven skin tones. Some products offer multifunctional benefits as well. For instance, Olay Total Effects 7-In-1 Anti-Aging Facial Cleanser Lathering Cleansing Cloths from P&G targets multiple skin concerns such as aging skin, dark spots, and dryness. Brijesh Kumar Choubey, a lead cosmetics and toiletry analyst at Technavio, says, "The age group of target consumers is another major factor considered by skincare product manufacturers. For instance, Estée Lauder, through its brand CLINIQUE, and LVMH, through its brand philosophy, offer facial wipes for different age groups such as teens, age group of 20-29 years, and age group of 30-39 years." Smaller packs and multipurpose facial wipes Convenience and portability are the two major factors considered by consumers when they buy facial wipes. To specifically target the varying needs of consumers, manufacturers of skincare products are introducing smaller or travel-sized packs of facial wipes. These smaller packs are portable and are available at low costs. Such advantages offered by smaller packs create a value proposition for consumers who lead a hectic lifestyle and who travel frequently. Developed markets such as the US, the UK, Germany, Japan, and Australia have a relatively high penetration of smaller packs of facial wipes. "Multipurpose wipes are gaining rapid popularity. Consumers have started preferring facial wipes that provide multiple benefits such as removal of facial breakouts and acne, dryness, enlarged pores, oiliness, fine lines and wrinkles, redness and rosacea, and loss of elasticity," adds Brijesh Increasing inclination toward all-natural facial wipes The demand for natural products is increasing across markets, which includes facial wipes as well. With a rise in awareness about the effects of chemicals such as parabens and multiple hydrocarbons on the skin in the long run, consumers have now started looking for facial wipes that are made with natural and herbal ingredients. This awareness is higher in developed western countries, followed by developing countries such as China, India, and Brazil, where natural facial wipe products are being launched. In addition to established players, domestic or regional players such as Pacifica and SheaMoisture are also extending their product portfolio to include natural facial wipes. Some examples of popular natural facial wipes from these smaller manufacturers include Purify Coconut Water Cleansing Wipes, Enzymatic Wipes Mini, Purify Coconut Wipe Mini, and Enzymatic Exfoliating Wipes from Pacifica; and Raw Shea Butter Hydrating Cleansing Facial Wipes, Superfruit Multivitamin Renewal Cleansing Facial Wipes, and Coconut Hibiscus Radiance Cleansing Facial Wipes from SheaMositure.

Published on November 03, 2016. Most Popular Credit: 1010data Amazon's private-label program has become a major threat to big brands in certain categories, particularly batteries, according to a new analysis from 1010data, the data management firm. Based on measurement of online spending from a panel of more than 10 million consumers between September 2015 and August 2016, 1010data found that Amazon and affiliates controlled a whopping 94% of the approximately $113 million in online battery sales. The AmazonBasics private label had a 31% share of online battery sales, according to 1010data, more than double the 13.1% share that private-label batteries had in offline stores for the 52 weeks ended Oct. 18, according to Nielsen data from Deutsche Bank. AmazonBasics, in fact, easily outsold every battery brand online, including offline leader Duracell, now owned by Berkshire Hathaway after Procter & Gamble Co. divested it in March. Duracell had a 21% online share. The titans of offline batteries can take solace in the fact that the online category remains small. It's only around 4% of the Nielsen-measured offline business, which doesn't even include big outlets like Costco, home improvement stores and some dollar stores. But the online battery category is growing fast, up 75% in the past year, according to 1010data. And AmazonBasics is growing even faster, with sales up 93%. The conversion rate, or the percentage of people who buy batteries after viewing them online, is 17.7% for AmazonBasics, vs. 9.8% for the category as a whole. Amazon is also making less-dramatic headway in other categories such as baby wipes, where its Elements private label has 16% of the estimated $60 billion in online sales. Here Amazon and affiliates have a smaller but still commanding 80% share of online sales, according to 1010data. Kimberly-Clark Corp.'s Huggies and P&G's Pampers are the category leaders in wipes online, just like offline. And at this point, Amazon's private-label share is still behind the nearly 37% store-brand share in offline outlets measured by Nielsen. But at less than two years old, Amazon Elements is newer than AmazonBasics, which launched its batteries in 2009. Amazon also has a commanding presence in the bigger $1 billion market for online speakers behind its Echo brand, according to 1010 data, with a 45% market share among the top 10 brands sold. Echo sales are up 67% year over year, according to the firm. "No matter the market, the challenge for brands in an increasing number of categories is that Amazon is the top online channel," said Jed Alpert, senior VP-marketing at 1010data, in a statement. "The bottom line for brands is that they can no longer view Amazon as solely a channel and need to acknowledge Amazon as a competitor." Reasons for Amazon's private-label success vary across markets, he said, with price the key driving factor in batteries, but a truly innovative product fueling the growth of Echo.

The ad entitled “Ladies Room” depicts Dana, a transgender woman, steeling herself to leave the anonymity of the bathroom stall and join the other women in at the sinks and mirrors of a public restroom. In the ad, Karis Wilde plays Dana and though she says nothing, it is apparent what’s going through her head – anxiety, some fear, perhaps shame. Finally she emerges from the stall as the following caption appears on the screen: “Stress test #8260 — Dana finds the courage to show there’s no wrong way to be a woman.” “I always have moments of insecurity but I have conditioned myself to act unbothered,” Karis told Queerty when asked if the scene bears any resemblance to her daily life. “While shooting, I allowed myself to feel vulnerable. It terrified me how much I’ve stored all those emotions; I almost cried in the middle of taping.” Watch the ad above. Procter & Gamble has a score of 100 on HRC’s Corporate Equality Index, an annual survey and report that benchmarks the LGBTQ inclusive policies, practices and benefits of America’s largest companies.

Chief Executive Bob Iger's scheduled retirement date looms closer, the entertainment giant's search for his replacement remains low-profile, a departure from the open process it previously employed. It's been seven months since heir apparent Tom Staggs' abrupt departure left Iger without a clear-cut successor. The top executive recruiting firms say they haven't been hired by Disney, and Iger hasn't moved members of his executive team into newer or more prominent roles to audition them for the top spot. The company has said only that there is a process in place that the board is following which will include evaluating internal and external candidates. VIDEOS TOP JOBS While there's still time to conduct a search before Iger's contract ends in June 2018, the quiet nature of the current succession planning stands in sharp contrast to the widely watched, five-year bake-off from which Staggs emerged as the leading contender for the job. That's fueling speculation that the board could request that Iger, 65, stay on longer than his scheduled retirement date, something it has already asked of him twice before. "I don't think anyone -- employee, investor or director -- would be hesitant in granting him a new contract," said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Nomura Securities in New York. "That could happen quickly and easily. Why hasn't it happened already? That's a fair question." Iger said on a May conference call with investors that he didn't have any plans to stick around past the current date. "The board is very actively engaged in a succession process, as it has been actually for some time," he said. "It believes that it has ample time to identify a successor under timing circumstances that will be just fine for the company." A spokeswoman for Disney declined to comment further. Disney board members on the governance and nominating committee, including former Starbucks Corp. CEO Orin Smith, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and former Clorox Chairman Robert Matschullat, didn't respond or declined to comment. Typically it takes a big public company six to seven months to complete a search once the board begins to contact and interview prospective candidates, though additional time is required before that, said Peter Crist, chairman of Crist Kolder Associates, a boutique search firm outside Chicago. "We do lots of mapping projects with the company that take months" about the qualities it wants and needs in a new CEO, Crist said. At Wal-Mart Stores, executive recruiter Spencer Stuart began consulting with directors about what the company needed in a new leader and who they should consider about a year before Doug McMillon was named the retailer's CEO in November 2013, according to people familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified because they aren't authorized to talk publicly. The board narrowed its search to two internal candidates, McMillon and former head of U.S. operations Bill Simon, about six months before making its final decision. At Procter & Gamble, directors first started talking about replacing then-CEO Bob MacDonald in July 2012 and then asked A.G. Lafley to return as CEO and chairman in May 2013. Lafley, who'd already served as CEO at P&G from 2000 until 2009, immediately reorganized the company into four businesses, each headed by a president who was considered a contender for the CEO post. One of the four, David Taylor, was named global president of home care and subsequently also took charge of P&G's beauty business. In July 2015, Lafley and P&G's other directors named Taylor the consumer giant's new CEO, concluding the two-year process. Iger himself was promoted in 2005 after a six-month search by the board. The executive, who had led Disney's TV operations and international business and had served as president for five years, was evaluated against external candidates with help from Heidrick & Struggles, directors said at the time. He got the top job only after a high-profile campaign by some shareholders to oust then-CEO Michael Eisner. Former directors in a long-running feud with the company still criticized Iger's selection as hasty, but the board said it had been thorough and careful. Until this year, it looked as if Disney's choice for Iger's successor would be more orderly, with a seasoned executive waiting in the wings in the COO position. Staggs had risen to the No. 2 spot at the company after a five-year period in which he and another senior manager, Jay Rasulo, competed with each other to become Iger's successor, even switching jobs to give Staggs more experience operating a business and Rasulo exposure to the executive suite. Rasulo, then serving as chief financial officer, left the company last year after Staggs's promotion to COO. Staggs's exit, after failing to gain the full backing of Iger and the board, left no other internal candidate with both operational experience and a corporate role. Of the six CEOs since Disney's founding in 1923, only Eisner came from the outside. Eisner, who served from 1984 to 2005, joined the company from Paramount Pictures, where he was president. » Next page...

Tech firms are the best place to look. brionv via Flickr By James K. Glassman, Contributing Columnist From Kiplinger's Personal Finance, December 2016 Rapidly rising revenues are my favorite indicator of a great company. Economists say that a stock’s value ultimately reflects the profits—not the revenues, or sales—that a firm is expected to reap in the future. But it’s easier for a company to manipulate reported earnings than revenues. Moreover, although a firm can cut costs to boost profits over the short term, even if sales are stagnant, cost-cutting isn’t a productive long-term strategy. See Also: 10 Worst Stocks of the Bull Market To get higher profits over the long haul, you need higher sales. And to get higher sales, you need products and services that keep improving. Where is that improvement most dramatic? In technology firms. Alphabet (symbol GOOGL, $804), the former Google, is now raking in ad sales at a rate of more than $6 billion a month, or roughly the same as all the television networks combined. But Alphabet has other ventures, including apps, maps, self-driving cars, broadband and health care, and it has made investments in more than 300 businesses, including Uber and Nest (see A Smarter Way to Heat and Cool Your Home). Stocks in boldface are those I recommend; prices are as of September 30. Amazon.com (AMZN, $837) is not just the world’s largest online retailer; it also runs a $10-billion-a-year cloud-computing business, makes the world’s number-one streaming media player (Fire TV), and produces original TV series that this year received five Emmy awards. Amazon’s price-earnings ratio is a sky-high 95, based on projected earnings for the year ahead, but I don’t care. Big profits will come later. Advertisement In the second quarter of 2016, total revenues for the companies that make up Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 1.2% compared with the same period a year earlier. But revenues at Facebook (FB, $128) in the same quarter soared 59%. Sales at Netflix (NFLX) have increased by an average annual rate of 26% over the past five years; Amazon and Alphabet, by 26% and 21%, respectively. Comparing Value Line’s estimates of revenues for 2016 with actual results in 2010, I found that Facebook’s revenues have risen by a factor of 13, and those of Amazon, Net­flix and Alphabet have each more than tripled. (Facebook did not go public until 2012, but the company reported its audited financial results for previous years.) By contrast, revenues for Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) rose a total of just 14%, and sales for Procter & Gamble (PG) have actually fallen. Of course, it’s the future, not the past, that counts for shareholders. Analysts believe these four companies—collectively known as the FANGs (the last letter coming from Alphabet’s former name)—will keep growing at a remarkable pace. Value Line projects that over the next five years, the rate of growth of revenues for Facebook will be 31%; Amazon and Netflix, 20%; Alphabet, 13%. In a U.S. economy that is growing by only about 3% annually, including inflation, these figures are mind-boggling. (For another take on the FANGs, see Practical Investing.) Before you rush out to buy the FANG stocks, consider an intriguing alternative. Nearly 20 years ago, I introduced readers to a portfolio devised by Leslie Douglas, of Folger Nolan Fleming Douglas, a venerable Washington, D.C., investment firm that was founded in 1889. Les Douglas, who died at age 96 in 2010, had an elegant idea for his clients: Buy equal dollar amounts of the five largest stocks on the Nasdaq exchange at the start of each year, then repeat annually. The brilliance of the Douglas Theory is that, first, you own big tech companies, which tend to be more stable than smaller ones; second, by reallocating each year, you shift your money away from stocks that have soared recently and toward those that may be better values; and, finally, your portfolio gradually changes with the times. Advertisement For example, in 1997, when I first wrote about the Douglas Theory, the five largest Nasdaq stocks were Cisco Systems (CSCO), Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT, $58), Oracle (ORCL) and MCI (which later merged into WorldCom, which filed for bankruptcy in 2002). Four of the five are no longer on the Douglas Theory list. Compared with the FANGs, Douglas drops Netflix and adds Apple (AAPL), which has the largest market cap of any U.S. company, and Microsoft, which ranks third, after Alphabet. Apple is no slouch when it comes to revenue growth—up an average of 37% annually for the past five years. Microsoft is the outlier, with just 9% annualized growth. Since 1991, Douglas Theory stocks have gained an average of 24% a year, or about twice the return of the S&P 500. Last year, the portfolio returned 42%, compared with 1.4% for the S&P, and in the first nine months of 2016, Douglas earned 12.9%, compared with 7.8% for the S&P. Another way to buy fast-growing tech stocks is through PowerShares QQQ (QQQ, $119), an exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq 100 index. Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon account for 40% of the fund’s assets. Over the past 10 years, QQQ returned 12.3% annualized, an average of 5.0 percentage points per year more than the S&P 500. With the high returns of fast growers, however, comes high short-term risk. Over the past three years, QQQ has been 29% more volatile than the S&P 500. That said, the balance sheets of the fast growers are rock-solid. Value Line gives its highest rating for “financial strength,” A++, to Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft; Amazon and Facebook each get an impressive A+. Alphabet has $78 billion in cash and short-term investments and just $4 billion in debt; Facebook has $23 billion in cash and short-term investments and no debt. Advertisement I noted earlier that Amazon’s P/E is in the stratosphere, but I don’t think that all of the FANG and Douglas stocks are overpriced. Facebook’s P/E is 27, based on projected profits. That’s not too pricey for a company whose sales are growing so rapidly. Alphabet’s P/E is 21; Microsoft’s is 19; Apple’s, 13. Netflix, which has eked out only small profits, has a P/E of 154. In fact, I have some worries about Netflix—as much as I love its service. Unlike the other five companies, it has only a single business line, and it has attracted some rough competition. Also, it is much smaller than the others. There’s a case for eliminating Microsoft as well because its growth rate is so much lower (Value Line projects just 7% annual profit growth for the next five years). But Microsoft has clearly gotten a second wind, and I would leave it in a collection of fast growers with Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon. Call them the Four Revenue Risers for the Millennium, or an FRRM portfolio of FAAM stocks. No guarantees, of course, but you should get a profitable ride over the long haul.

Why are you running for office? Property taxes continue to increase each year, while the county schools lack the funding for repairs and updated equipment. Industries look at the schools, the education systems as a strong, solid foundation of a county. In order for the county to grow the tax base county commissioners and school board officials need to seek out grants and explore other avenues to acquire revenue to support school capital projects. We have great teachers that need a well functioning schools and the resources to teach the required skills to our children/young adults for them to be able to work in not only today, but also in the future work forces of the 21st century. I want to work with the school board to bring in resources to improve our county schools.I want to seek way to grow the tax base that will bring real jobs to Chowan County. I want to find the means to reduce the county poverty level. 2. Why should people vote for you? I have integrity, commitment and experience with multi-million dollar budgets. I will work to reduce property taxes. I believe that all elected officials, thru their actions, shall be committed to protecting the health, safety & welfare of all the county citizens. I will work toward improving the counties infrastructure that manufacturing industries need in order to operate in the county. I will encourage and support additional technical training at the high school & College of the Albemarle campuses. Technical training will provide the citizens greater opportunities to learn skills that attract new business to Chowan County. 3. What’s your favorite thing about the area you want to represent? Small bedroom communities interacting with farms to create a family friendly county. The people are great, for the most part they want less government, less taxes and to be able to spend/save their money for what they want, not what the government dictates. 4. What is the biggest problem your area is facing, how will you fix it? There is a double edge problem: Low tax base and a 27+ % of Chowan counties population below the poverty level. By increasing the tax base ( growing jobs ), will help decrease the poverty rate. I will work toward solving the problem by following thru with my statements #1 & 2 above. 5. Describe Donald Trump in max 3 words? Businessman 6. Describe Hillary Clinton in max 3 words? Another dishonest politician 7. What do you do for a living? Why do you do it? I served 23 years in the United States Navy, Vietnam & Persian Gulf Veteran in several leadership positions. I joined the Navy after high school. I want to do my part to protect our freedoms, liberty and the people I love. Worked 6 years with Procter & Gamble as a Manufacturing & Utilities Manager. Worked 16 years with Mitsubishi Kagaku Imaging Corp. as a Production and Logistics Supervisor. Retired and now serving as a member & treasure of the Beekeepers of the Albemarle ( 118 active members ). Served a term on the N.C. Workforce Development Commission. While visiting Community Colleges thru-out the state, I heard business leaders talk about the skills needed for young and older adults in the job market today. Active member of the Chowan Perquimans Habitat for Humanity. Worked many hours on the projects this year. Active member of the Edenton United Methodist Church. The jobs, work that I have done over the years has been fulfilling, rewarding and enabled me to help others learn and grow. A person should always be teaching others, not only your own personal job, but also areas where they can continue to grow and to seek new knowledge as well. 8. You’re going to be marooned on a tropical island for a week, you can only bring 1 thing – what is it? This being a tropical island, I would believe there is water, food and shelter. Then all I would need to take is a Bible. 9. What do you think of Colin Kaepernick? A very spoiled and disrespectful young man. 10. Would you vote to fund light rail expansion in your area? NO 11. Will you respect the outcome of the election? There has been problems in every election that I know of since I became of age to vote ( 21 at that time ). So, who ever wins the election, there will be voter fraud. And until the media takes the time to researches and publish the facts, until the justice system remain blind to the who and seeks out the facts, there will always be voter fraud. So, to answer your question – NO. Even if the person I vote for wins. There is still voter fraud that need to be fixed. Start with VOTER I.D. 12. Favorite TV Show? Nascar, where prayer is given before each event, where the U.S. flag is still respected, where our Military and First Responders are still respected and treated as the heroes they are.

Suit threatened over West Virginia's access to waters of Potomac - Business, Government Legal News from throughout WV Member Center: Create Account| Log In Manage Account| Log Out SITE SEARCHWEB SEARCH BY Home News Business Government Energy Law Opinion Lynne D. Schwabe Brooks McCabe Charlie Bowen John Brown Dolly Withrow Linda Arnold Government Law Energy SHOP About Us Job Openings Suit threatened over West Virginia's access to waters of Potomac River Posted: Thursday, November 3, 2016 2:27 PM EDT Updated: Thursday, November 3, 2016 2:53 PM EDT Efforts to limit West Virginia's access to the Potomac River could land the State of Maryland in court, the WV Attorney General's Office said. The office expressed willingness to sue Maryland if its leaders continue to limit West Virginia's access to the Potomac River, a water source said to be critical to economic expansion in the Eastern Panhandle. Those concerns were outlined in a letter to Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh and Secretary of the Environment Benjamin H. Grumbles challenging Maryland’s time-consuming and costly permit process, arguing the Mountain State’s neighbor has no legal authority to interfere with West Virginia’s access to the Potomac River. The letter voices concern Maryland is claiming regulatory authority to tilt the competitive balance in its favor by limiting the Mountain State's access to basic utilities, like water. The letter comes at a time when rapid population growth and commercial development is projected to increase the Eastern Panhandle’s daily demand for water by 2 million gallons, including a Procter & Gamble plant under construction in Martinsburg, WV, which, by itself, will require 1.3 million gallons each day to maintain operations.   The letter cites as legal authority a 1785 compact between Maryland and Virginia, which gave Virginia a sovereign right to the Potomac’s water. The U.S. Supreme Court has suggested that West Virginia, which has a common history with Virginia, is entitled to the same rights under the 231-year-old compact. Maryland’s leadership has 21 days to agree that its agencies lack authority to regulate West Virginia’s use of the Potomac and agree to work with West Virginia in drafting an interstate compact for submission to the U.S. Congress. Otherwise, the letter states West Virginia will file an original action with the U.S. Supreme Court to seek a declaration of its rights to the Potomac River.

Sharing my Portfolio and maybe talking about VGM Around the World Started by Methropoly, Nov 03 2016 08:21 AM You cannot reply to this topic No replies to this topic #1 Methropoly   Members   -  Reputation: 124 Like 0Likes Like Posted 03 November 2016 - 08:21 AM Hi! (sorry in advance  for my english)   My name is Gustavo Barcamor, and I've been a professional composer since 2006. I specialized in games in 2010. Did some international jobs too, but since i work in Brazil, I would like to talk to you about how is videogames music doing around the world, for those of us who are not big in the industry. I have a lot of experience, since I've been working here as a composer for games by Intel, LG, P&G... but it's not common here. Did some music for amazing indie games too, and I feel indie is the way to go for most of us.   Anyway, my portfolio is here: LATEST JOB: ONE I SPECIALLY LIKE:   General stuff (not only for games): www.soundcloud.com/gustavo-barcamor I hope you enjoy! And now I'm going to listen to your songs too. Bye!

Beiersdorf said it now expected its margin on earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in 2016 to significantly exceed the year-earlier figure of 14.4 percent. That is better than a previous forecast for a slight improvement. The new guidance meant an increase by more than 0.5 percentage points, finance chief Jesper Andersen told analysts, without being more specific. Margins were boosted by more efficient procurement and logisitcs as well as lower marketing expenses, he said. Beiersdorf stuck with its forecast for 3 to 4 percent sales growth this year with its consumer business, which includes cosmetics brands Nivea, Eucerin and La Prairie, bouncing back after a slow first half of the year. But its margins continue to be lower than those of consumer goods competitors, such as Unilever, Procter & Gamble and L'Oreal, which in recent months have been snatching up smaller companies and niche brands to build scale and enter new consumer markets. Pressed by analysts on whether Beiersdorf intended to follow a similar path, Chief Executive Stefan Heidenreich said the company's main priority remained organic growth. "It's true that we have cash and that we are looking at things," Heidenreich said. "But we will follow our strategy which is organic, organic and then, if something comes, we will look at it." Organic sales across all business segments rose by 2.9 percent to 5.03 billion euros ($5.60 billion) in the first nine months of 2016. The group did not publish earnings figures for the period. Shares in Beiersdorf were up 4 percent at 81.52 euros by 1040 GMT, outperforming a flat German blue-chip index. They earlier rose more than 6 percent.

On the macro front, the Nikkei India Services Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, rose to 54.5 in October from 52 in September. A reading above 50 indicates economic expansion, while a reading below 50 points toward contraction. The service sector joined its manufacturing counterpart in offering a more upbeat level of performance this month, providing reassurance in the sustainability of the upturn of India's economy, Pollyanna De Lima, economist at IHS Markit said. She added that one underlying concern is the sustained stagnant trend in workforces, with both manufacturers and service providers showing some reluctance to hire. Meanwhile, international rating agency Standard & Poor's (S&P) yesterday, 2 November 2016 affirmed "BBB-/A-3" rating with stable outlook for India. The stable outlook balances India's sound external position and inclusive policy making tradition against the vulnerabilities stemming from its low per capita income and weak public finances, S&P said. The ratings on India reflect the country's sound external profile and improved monetary credibility, the agency said. The outlook indicates that rating agency does not expect to change its rating on India this year or next, based on our current set of forecasts, it said. Improvements in policy making continue to strengthen the prospects for India's economic and fiscal performance. Wide fiscal deficits, a heavy debt burden, and low per capita income nonetheless detract from the sovereign's credit profile, it added. In overseas stock markets, most Asian stocks were trading lower with uncertainty over next week's US presidential election sending investors rushing for the sidelines. US stocks fell yesterday, 2 November 2016, with the S&P 500 recording its longest losing streak in five years after the Federal Reserve, as expected, kept interest rates unchanged. The Federal Reserve yesterday, 2 November 2016 signaled that the time for another interest-rate hike is approaching and it doesn't need much more evidence before moving. The Fed policy committee voted 8 to 2 to maintain interest rates in a range of 0.25 to 0.5%. The Fed said inflation has been moving up toward its 2% target since the beginning of the year. Meanwhile, polls showed a tightening presidential race. A latest poll reportedly showed Republican nominee Donald Trump taking a one-point lead over rival Hillary Clinton. Investors generally view Clinton as a known quantity, but there is deep uncertainty about what a Trump win might mean for US economic policy, free trade and geopolitics.

The Fed policy committee voted 8 to 2 to maintain interest rates in a range of 0.25 to 0.5%. The Fed said inflation has been moving up toward its 2% target since the beginning of the year. Meanwhile, polls showed a tightening presidential race. A latest poll reportedly showed Republican nominee Donald Trump taking a one-point lead over rival Hillary Clinton. Investors generally view Clinton as a known quantity, but there is deep uncertainty about what a Trump win might mean for US economic policy, free trade and geopolitics.

On the macro front, the Nikkei India Services Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, rose to 54.5 in October from 52 in September. A reading above 50 indicates economic expansion, while a reading below 50 points toward contraction. The service sector joined its manufacturing counterpart in offering a more upbeat level of performance this month, providing reassurance in the sustainability of the upturn of India's economy, Pollyanna De Lima, economist at IHS Markit said. She added that one underlying concern is the sustained stagnant trend in workforces, with both manufacturers and service providers showing some reluctance to hire. Meanwhile, international rating agency Standard & Poor's (S&P) yesterday, 2 November 2016 affirmed "BBB-/A-3" rating with stable outlook for India. The stable outlook balances India's sound external position and inclusive policy making tradition against the vulnerabilities stemming from its low per capita income and weak public finances, S&P said. The ratings on India reflect the country's sound external profile and improved monetary credibility, the agency said. The outlook indicates that rating agency does not expect to change its rating on India this year or next, based on our current set of forecasts, it said. Improvements in policy making continue to strengthen the prospects for India's economic and fiscal performance. Wide fiscal deficits, a heavy debt burden, and low per capita income nonetheless detract from the sovereign's credit profile, it added. In overseas stock markets, most Asian stocks were trading lower with uncertainty over next week's US presidential election sending investors rushing for the sidelines. US stocks fell yesterday, 2 November 2016, with the S&P 500 recording its longest losing streak in five years after the Federal Reserve, as expected, kept interest rates unchanged.

Home Latest News Submit News About Us FAQ News Search: More search options Consumer: India Cosmetic Market anticipated to get more than double by 2021: Bonafide Research  Previous Release Next Release   India Cosmetic Market anticipated to get more than double by 2021: Bonafide Research Increasing purchasing power and disposable income, urbanization, growing awareness about beauty products and manufacturers aggressively pushing products in rural India is driving the volume sales of cosmetic products robustly. Affordability and rising consumer base in the country are also responsible for high cosmetic sales [ClickPress, Wed Nov 02 2016] In the cosmetics and beauty sector, there have been sweeping changes. Expensive international beauty products are selling rapidly as the Indian women are investing in long term beauty. The biggest beauty evolution in India's recent past, however, is not restricted to women. Men have taken to healthier skin routine, away from the gym. The rise in men's salons is evidence to the fact that men want more beauty for themselves. The menu cards on offer at men's salons include treatments that were earlier meant for women. Men's salons have now started offering a multitude of beauty services while beauty brands now have a special product line-up dedicated specifically for men's grooming. As per ASSOCHAM, the per capita consumption of cosmetics in India is approximately US$ 0.68 cents as compared to US$ 40 in Hong Kong, US$ 12 in Japan, and US$ 1.5 in China. Consumption of these products centers on young women, with the age group 15-44 years accounting for about 70% of the market. Consumption begins in the teens and tapers off after 45, and declines substantially after 55. According to recently published report of Bonafide Research India Cosmetic Market Outlook, 2021, cosmetic market in India was growing with a CAGR of 17.06% over past few years. The urban population with increasing purchasing power is the major force driving demand for cosmetic products. India is a very price-sensitive market and mass-market products constitute the major part of the cosmetics market. Urban India leads the market, with more than four-fifth of the cosmetic segment consumption by volume. However, rural consumption exceeds urban consumption in toilet soaps and is almost equal to urban sales of hair oil, the lowest end of the hair care market. Many domestic and international companies are now targeting the rural markets to push volume sales in categories like lip and nail care, and some mass skin care products as well. Meanwhile, urban consumption is evolving, moving from basic functional to more superior and specialized products, and greater expenditure levels. Moreover, there is a rise in consumption of mens products, including skin care products, which were earlier considered purely the womans sphere. The dominant international players include Hindustan UniLever, the subsidiary of Unilever with all its international and Indian brands, LOreal, along with its subsidiary Maybelline and Garnier brands, Revlon, Nivea, Biersdorf, Schwarzkopf, Palmolive, and Proctor & Gamble including Gillette. Lakmé as a brand dominates the cosmetic industry in India, owned by Unilever. Stiff competition has resulted in an increase in the range of new products being introduced for newer application concepts in the last few years. In the skin-care segment, from just creams and moisturizers, there has been an upgrade to value-added products such as under eye wrinkle removing creams, dark circle removing creams toners, sunscreen lotions, fairness creams, and many more. The colour cosmetics market saw new products such as smudge-proof lipsticks and mascaras, liquid lip colour, and long-lasting lipsticks being introduced. However, low and medium-priced categories account for almost 85-90% of the cosmetics market in terms of volume.

Watches! By Todd Plummer • 11/02/16 11:01am Braun is dedicated to branching out into design. Courtesy Braun In the sleepy German village of Kronberg, about an hour’s drive from Frankfurt, Braun is housed in a quiet campus of elegant glass buildings, a stark contrast against the rural and pastoral landscape. Something about being far from a major urban or industrial area speaks to the Braun brand motto: Less But Better. Out here, there are fewer distractions, and the hundreds of engineers, marketers and, of course, designers have more breathing space to think of the next great generation of Braun products. In America, Braun is recognized for two things: electronic shavers (which are not as popular stateside as they are in Europe, as most men here prefer a good-old wet shave) and their Oral-B electronic toothbrushes. For the first time this fall, however, Braun is launching a complete offering of watches. Though the brand had dipped their toes in the category with a model or two over the last couple of seasons, this newly expanded line features a classic minimalist design ethos. Bands come in either sleek leather or stainless steel, and the faces skew towards the classic Braun alarm clock style with Helvetica numbers, or slightly more chronographic, for timepiece connoisseurs. Competitively priced between $200 and $800, there is something here for everyone. Benjamin Wilson, a designer by trade and Braun’s Global Scientific Communicator, pointed out the obvious to the Observer: in the age of smartphones, people don’t necessarily need watches anymore. “It’s more of an object of designer or want,” he said. “It’s part of your style and says something about your taste and who you are as a person. That’s where Braun comes into play—the watches are not over the top, they don’t scream ‘Look at me!’ And they connect directly back to our motto, Less But Better.” Look at that simple detail. Courtesy Braun The move into watches comes at an interesting time for Braun, which for the last couple of years has been quietly repositioning itself as a full-blown design brand. The interesting thing is that this isn’t a novel move for Braun, but more of a return to their roots. Founded in 1921 by Max Braun, the brand primarily focused on radios for the first thirty years or so. This was during WWII and the early part of the mid-twentieth century, when radios were the centerpieces of living rooms around the world. In the 1950’s, Braun expanded into kitchen appliances, coffee makers, their now-iconic shavers, clocks and radios; through the 1970’s, Braun remained as one of the world’s leading industrial design brands. Things began to change in 1984 when Gillette Group acquired Braun. For the next twenty years or so, Braun appeared to be thriving, but profitability became a clear issue. Globalization changed how household products were made, and suddenly, it became much more fashionable for Braun’s competitors to mimic their uniquely minimal design aesthetic and produce products in cheaper places around the world. In 2005, Gillette sold its interest in Braun to Proctor & Gamble, which, in a move to focus on raising profits, discontinued sales of all Braun products in North America except for shavers and electric toothbrushes (hence why Americans today feel like these are Braun’s most familiar categories). The Braun installation at the London Design Festival. Courtesy Braun Lately, it feels like Braun has been making a concerted effort to return to its truest form. This year, Braun was a leading sponsor of the new London Design Festival, a weeklong event celebrating the best in industrial and product design. They collaborated with award-winning designer Benjamin Walker on “Foil,” a 20-meter long undulating ribbon created from Braun stainless steel, in pieces that resembled razor blades. It was installed in the long tapestry room at the Victoria & Albert Museum. Their interaction in the festival was part of a larger effort to bring Braun’s commitment and history of design to the forefront, so people stop perceiving them as just purveyors of shavers and toothbrushes. “In our world,” said Wilson, “the design and engineering that takes place behind the scenes is almost intangible—the consumer can’t see it, can’t touch it. The platform that the London Design Festival produced with us and the Braun Foil installation that we created started a great dialogue for people outside of the design community. For those that got to experience the combination of a tech tapestry in 2016 in contrast to 1000 year old tapestries that were hanging on the walls, it was quite an engaging and emotional experience.” That said, shavers remain a strong category — the Series 9, which was released this year, is wildly popular and has been met with nearly-flawless reviews from the grooming world. The watches have been met with similar enthusiasm, both from critics and retailers, including MR PORTER, alike. It’s an interesting time for Braun, and appears to be a make-or-break moment for the brand. As Wilson explained, if the shavers can perform well, then so can other categories. “I wouldn’t say that the shavers themselves influence the other categories, but more so the industrial design and manufacturing processes play a key role in informing our design today. We call this taking the past forward, which, as it says, takes elements, materials, and processes from the past, reinterprets them, and integrates them as important elements in the products of tomorrow… If there’s an unmet need in our consumer’s life, we will create something to help solve that problem.” This is not a shaver, nor a toothbrush. Courtesy Braun Whether Braun can return to its midcentury glory days remains to be seen, but with the careful and calculated move into watches — applying their iconic minimalist ethos to must-have products that feel right for 2016 — it would seem that they are on the right track.

PRLog XHome Login Latest News News By Location News By Industry News By Tag News By Date Business Profiles Pressrooms Get Feeds Get Alerted Journalist Account PRNewswire Distribution Search India Cosmetic Market anticipated to get more than double by 2021: Bonafide Research Increasing purchasing power and disposable income, urbanization, growing awareness about beauty products and manufacturers aggressively pushing products in rural India is driving the volume sales of cosmetic products robustly. India Cosmetic Market Outlook, 2021   Spread the Word: News By Tag: * Apparels & Lifestyle * India Cosmetics Market * Outlook By Industry: * ConsumerVADODARA, India - Nov. 2, 2016 - PRLog -- In the cosmetics and beauty sector, there have been sweeping changes. Expensive international beauty products are selling rapidly as the Indian women are investing in long term beauty. The biggest beauty evolution in India's recent past, however, is not restricted to women. Men have taken to healthier skin routine, away from the gym. The rise in men's salons is evidence to the fact that men want more beauty for themselves. The menu cards on offer at men's salons include treatments that were earlier meant for women. Men's salons have now started offering a multitude of beauty services while beauty brands now have a special product line-up dedicated specifically for men's grooming. As per ASSOCHAM, the per capita consumption of cosmetics in India is approximately US$ 0.68 cents as compared to US$ 40 in Hong Kong, US$ 12 in Japan, and US$ 1.5 in China. Consumption of these products centers on young women, with the age group 15-44 years accounting for about 70% of the market. Consumption begins in the teens and tapers off after 45, and declines substantially after 55. According to recently published report of Bonafide Research "India Cosmetic Market Outlook, 2021", cosmetic market in India was growing with a CAGR of 17.06% over past few years. The urban population with increasing purchasing power is the major force driving demand for cosmetic products. India is a very price-sensitive market and mass-market products constitute the major part of the cosmetics market. Urban India leads the market, with more than four-fifth of the cosmetic segment consumption by volume. However, rural consumption exceeds urban consumption in toilet soaps and is almost equal to urban sales of hair oil, the lowest end of the hair care market. Many domestic and international companies are now targeting the rural markets to push volume sales in categories like lip and nail care, and some mass skin care products as well. Meanwhile, urban consumption is evolving, moving from basic functional to more superior and specialized products, and greater expenditure levels. Moreover, there is a rise in consumption of men's products, including skin care products, which were earlier considered purely the woman's sphere. The dominant international players include Hindustan UniLever, the subsidiary of Unilever with all its international and Indian brands, L'Oreal, along with its subsidiary Maybelline and Garnier brands, Revlon, Nivea, Biersdorf, Schwarzkopf, Palmolive, and Proctor & Gamble including Gillette. Lakmé as a brand dominates the cosmetic industry in India, owned by Unilever. Stiff competition has resulted in an increase in the range of new products being introduced for newer application concepts in the last few years. In the skin-care segment, from just creams and moisturizers, there has been an upgrade to value-added products such as under eye wrinkle removing creams, dark circle removing creams toners, sunscreen lotions, fairness creams, and many more. The colour cosmetics market saw new products such as smudge-proof lipsticks and mascaras, liquid lip colour, and long-lasting lipsticks being introduced. However, low and medium-priced categories account for almost 85-90% of the cosmetics market in terms of volume.

Home > News By Company > ReportsWeb.com Tweet   Global Hair And Body Mist Market To Grow At A CAGR Of 7.92% During The Period 2016-2020 ReportsWeb.com published Hair and Body Mist Market from its database. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. (EMAILWIRE.COM, November 02, 2016 ) The global hair and body mist market will grow at a gradual rate over the forecast period. Although the market will be affected by a slowdown in demand in key countries like the US, Germany, the UK, France, Italy, Spain, and Japan as they near maturity, this will be offset by a strengthening of demand in developing countries such as Brazil, India, Malaysia, and China. The growth potential is higher in these emerging markets because of the increasing purchasing power of their growing middle-class population and high population density. More than one-and-a-half billion people in APAC will enter the middle-income class over the next ten years. Consumer purchasing power in the region is also increasing because of the rise in personal disposable income, which is growing at a rate much higher than that of developed countries. In 2015, personal annual disposable income increased by 7.01% in China and 8.61% in India, whereas it grew by 2.07% in Germany and 1.29% in France. Publisher's analysts forecast the global hair and body mist market to grow at a CAGR of 7.92% during the period 2016-2020.

02, 2016, 06:30 ET Share this article OAKLAND, Calif., Nov. 2, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The Clorox Company (NYSE: CLX) today reported sales growth of 4 percent and an increase of 3 percent in diluted net earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations for its first quarter, which ended September 30, 2016. On a currency-neutral basis, first-quarter sales grew 6 percent. "I'm very pleased about our solid start to the fiscal year, as investments behind our 2020 Strategy, including product innovation, resulted in continued strong topline growth," said Chairman and CEO Benno Dorer. "Notably, we grew volume in all U.S. and International segments. We also delivered these results on top of strong topline growth in the year-ago quarter." "As we look to the remainder of the fiscal year, I feel good about the health of our core business and am confident in the strategic plans we have in place in the face of a challenging macro-economic environment," continued Dorer. All results in this press release are reported on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise stated. Some information in this release is reported on a non-GAAP basis. See "Non-GAAP Financial Information" below and the tables toward the end of this press release for more information and reconciliations of key first-quarter fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2016 results to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP). Fiscal First-Quarter Results Following is a summary of key first-quarter results. All comparisons are with the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, unless otherwise stated. 8% volume growth 4% sales growth $1.36 diluted EPS (3% increase) In the first quarter, volume grew 8 percent, reflecting increases in all reportable segments, including the benefit of the RenewLife digestive health business, which was acquired in May 2016. Total company sales grew 4 percent, driven by strong volume growth, including 2 points from the RenewLife business, and the benefit of price increases in the company's international business. These factors were partially offset by unfavorable mix and 2 points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Clorox delivered earnings from continuing operations of $179 million, or $1.36 diluted EPS, compared to $173 million, or $1.32 diluted EPS, in the year-ago quarter. First-quarter diluted EPS results reflect higher sales and the benefit of cost savings, partially offset by higher manufacturing and logistics costs and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. First-quarter diluted EPS also reflects a 4-cent benefit from the adoption of the Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09, which was recently issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, addressing the accounting of employee share-based payments. This benefit, which is reflected in a lower tax rate in the first quarter versus year ago, was less than anticipated as fewer stock options were exercised by employees. The company had previously communicated that the benefit realized from the adoption of this accounting standard could vary significantly given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future share-based transactions. The company's updated outlook for the full-year impact of ASU 2016-09 is presented later in this press release. The company's first-quarter gross margin decreased 60 basis points to 44.4 percent from 45 percent in the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by higher manufacturing and logistics costs impacted by ongoing inflationary pressure and the timing of strategic investments to support growth and cost savings initiatives, unfavorable mix and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. These factors were partially offset by the benefits of cost savings, favorable commodity costs and price increases. First-quarter net cash provided by continuing operations was $170 million, compared with $135 million in the year-ago period. The year-over-year increase reflects higher tax payments in the year-ago period. Key Segment Results Following is a summary of key first-quarter results from continuing operations by reportable segment. All comparisons are with the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, unless otherwise stated. Cleaning (Laundry, Home Care, Professional Products)              13% volume growth 7% sales growth 10% pretax earnings growth Segment volume growth was driven largely by gains in Home Care, particularly record shipments of Clorox® disinfecting wipes behind expanded club-channel distribution and increased merchandising support for the back-to-school season. Record shipments across a number of Clorox-branded products, including toilet bowl cleaners and disinfecting spray products, also contributed to segment volume results. Professional Products also contributed to segment volume growth, reflecting strong gains across cleaning brands. The variance between volume and sales growth was due to unfavorable mix. Pretax earnings growth reflected higher sales and cost savings. Household (Bags and Wraps, Charcoal, Cat Litter, Digestive Health) 6% volume growth 3% sales growth 16% pretax earnings decrease Segment volume growth was driven primarily by the benefit of the RenewLife acquisition, partially offset by lower shipments in Charcoal, which grew volume by 6 percent in the year-ago quarter. Segment sales also increased, but trailed volume growth reflecting higher trade promotion spending, which included spending in Bags and Wraps to address competitive activity and in Cat Litter to support the Fresh Step® with Febreze innovation. Pretax earnings decreased driven by lower Charcoal volume, higher trade promotion spending and higher manufacturing and logistics costs. These factors were partially offset by the benefit of favorable commodity costs. Lifestyle (Dressings and Sauces, Water Filtration, Natural Personal Care) 1% volume growth 2% sales growth 5% pretax earnings growth Segment volume growth was driven primarily by gains in Natural Personal Care behind innovation in Burt's Bees® lip color products. Sales outpaced volume primarily due to lower trade promotion spending. Pretax earnings growth reflected higher sales and the benefits of cost savings and favorable commodity costs, partially offset by higher manufacturing and logistics costs. International   (Sales outside of the U.S.) 4% volume increase Flat sales (10% growth, currency-neutral basis) 16% pretax earnings decrease Segment volume results were driven primarily by gains in Canada, reflecting base business growth and the benefit of the RenewLife acquisition, as well as growth in the Burt's Bees business in Asia, partially offset by decreases in select Latin America countries, notably Argentina. Volume outpaced flat sales, largely due to the impact of 10 percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency exchanges rates, partially offset by price increases. Excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, segment sales grew 10 percent. Pretax earnings decreased, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and inflationary pressure on higher manufacturing and logistics costs. These factors were partially offset by the benefit of price increases. Clorox Updates Fiscal Year 2017 EPS Outlook for Revised Tax Rate Assumptions; Expectations For Sales Growth and EBIT Margin Expansion Remain Unchanged 2% to 4% sales growth (unchanged) 25 basis points to 50 basis points of EBIT margin expansion (unchanged) $5.23 to $5.43 diluted EPS range (updated for ASU 2016-09 impact) $5.13 to $5.28, excluding ASU 2016-09 impact (unchanged) Clorox continues to anticipate delivering 2 percent to 4 percent sales growth in fiscal year 2017, reflecting about 2 percentage points of benefit from the RenewLife acquisition, partially offset by about 2 percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of 2 percentage points from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, the company continues to anticipate fiscal year sales to grow between 4 to 6 percent. Clorox continues to anticipate EBIT margin expansion for fiscal year 2017 to be in the range of 25 to 50 basis points, primarily driven by lower selling and administrative expenses, which are expected to be below 14 percent of sales. Clorox now anticipates its effective fiscal year 2017 tax rate to be between 32 percent and 33 percent versus its previous assumption of 30 percent and 31 percent, reflecting a 2-point reduction versus year ago compared to the previously assumed 4-point reduction from adopting ASU 2016-09. The company's updated assumptions for its fiscal year effective tax rate reflect lower than anticipated exercises of Clorox stock options in the first quarter and the company's revised outlook for full-year stock option exercises. As noted, the company had previously communicated that the benefit to be realized from the adoption of ASU 2016-19 could vary significantly. Net of all these factors, Clorox now anticipates fiscal year 2017 diluted EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.23 to $5.43, which includes the updated assumption of 10 to 15 cents of benefit to fiscal year EPS from adopting the accounting standards update. Excluding the benefit of adopting the accounting standards update, Clorox continues to anticipate fiscal year 2017 diluted EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.13 to $5.28. FY17 Outlook as of Aug. 3, 2016 as of Nov. 2, 2016 Diluted EPS, excluding ASU $5.13 to $5.28 $5.13 to $5.28 ASU 2016-09 benefit $0.25 to $0.30 $0.10 to $0.15 Diluted EPS Outlook $5.38 to $5.58 $5.23 to $5.43 For More Detailed Financial Information Visit the company's Financial Information: Quarterly Results section of the company's website at TheCloroxCompany.com for the following: Supplemental unaudited volume and sales growth information Supplemental unaudited gross margin driver information Supplemental unaudited reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial information, including earnings from continuing operations before interest and taxes (EBIT) and earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) Supplemental unaudited balance sheet and cash flow information and free cash flow reconciliation Supplemental price-change information Note: Percentage and basis-point changes noted in this press release are calculated based on rounded numbers.

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases Clorox Reports Q1 Fiscal Year 2017 Results, Including Strong Sales Growth; Updates Fiscal Year Tax-Rate Assumptions for EPS Outlook “As we look to the remainder of the fiscal year, I feel good about the health of our core business and am confident in the strategic plans we have in place in the face of a challenging macro-economic environment,” continued Dorer. All results in this press release are reported on a continuing operations basis, unless otherwise stated. Some information in this release is reported on a non-GAAP basis. See “Non-GAAP Financial Information” below and the tables toward the end of this press release for more information and reconciliations of key first-quarter fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2016 results to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP). Fiscal First-Quarter Results Following is a summary of key first-quarter results. All comparisons are with the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, unless otherwise stated. 8% volume growth 4% sales growth $1.36 diluted EPS (3% increase) In the first quarter, volume grew 8 percent, reflecting increases in all reportable segments, including the benefit of the RenewLife digestive health business, which was acquired in May 2016. Total company sales grew 4 percent, driven by strong volume growth, including 2 points from the RenewLife business, and the benefit of price increases in the company’s international business. These factors were partially offset by unfavorable mix and 2 points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Clorox delivered earnings from continuing operations of $179 million, or $1.36 diluted EPS, compared to $173 million, or $1.32 diluted EPS, in the year-ago quarter. First-quarter diluted EPS results reflect higher sales and the benefit of cost savings, partially offset by higher manufacturing and logistics costs and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. First-quarter diluted EPS also reflects a 4-cent benefit from the adoption of the Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09, which was recently issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, addressing the accounting of employee share-based payments. This benefit, which is reflected in a lower tax rate in the first quarter versus year ago, was less than anticipated as fewer stock options were exercised by employees. The company had previously communicated that the benefit realized from the adoption of this accounting standard could vary significantly given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future share-based transactions. The company’s updated outlook for the full-year impact of ASU 2016-09 is presented later in this press release. The company’s first-quarter gross margin decreased 60 basis points to 44.4 percent from 45 percent in the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by higher manufacturing and logistics costs impacted by ongoing inflationary pressure and the timing of strategic investments to support growth and cost savings initiatives, unfavorable mix and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. These factors were partially offset by the benefits of cost savings, favorable commodity costs and price increases. First-quarter net cash provided by continuing operations was $170 million, compared with $135 million in the year-ago period. The year-over-year increase reflects higher tax payments in the year-ago period. Key Segment Results Following is a summary of key first-quarter results from continuing operations by reportable segment. All comparisons are with the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, unless otherwise stated. Cleaning (Laundry, Home Care, Professional Products)              13% volume growth 7% sales growth 10% pretax earnings growth Segment volume growth was driven largely by gains in Home Care, particularly record shipments of Clorox® disinfecting wipes behind expanded club-channel distribution and increased merchandising support for the back-to-school season. Record shipments across a number of Clorox-branded products, including toilet bowl cleaners and disinfecting spray products, also contributed to segment volume results. Professional Products also contributed to segment volume growth, reflecting strong gains across cleaning brands. The variance between volume and sales growth was due to unfavorable mix. Pretax earnings growth reflected higher sales and cost savings. Household (Bags and Wraps, Charcoal, Cat Litter, Digestive Health) 6% volume growth 3% sales growth 16% pretax earnings decrease Segment volume growth was driven primarily by the benefit of the RenewLife acquisition, partially offset by lower shipments in Charcoal, which grew volume by 6 percent in the year-ago quarter. Segment sales also increased, but trailed volume growth reflecting higher trade promotion spending, which included spending in Bags and Wraps to address competitive activity and in Cat Litter to support the Fresh Step® with Febreze innovation. Pretax earnings decreased driven by lower Charcoal volume, higher trade promotion spending and higher manufacturing and logistics costs. These factors were partially offset by the benefit of favorable commodity costs. Lifestyle (Dressings and Sauces, Water Filtration, Natural Personal Care) 1% volume growth 2% sales growth 5% pretax earnings growth Segment volume growth was driven primarily by gains in Natural Personal Care behind innovation in Burt’s Bees® lip color products. Sales outpaced volume primarily due to lower trade promotion spending. Pretax earnings growth reflected higher sales and the benefits of cost savings and favorable commodity costs, partially offset by higher manufacturing and logistics costs. International   (Sales outside of the U.S.) 4% volume increase Flat sales (10% growth, currency-neutral basis) 16% pretax earnings decrease Segment volume results were driven primarily by gains in Canada, reflecting base business growth and the benefit of the RenewLife acquisition, as well as growth in the Burt’s Bees business in Asia, partially offset by decreases in select Latin America countries, notably Argentina. Volume outpaced flat sales, largely due to the impact of 10 percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency exchanges rates, partially offset by price increases. Excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, segment sales grew 10 percent. Pretax earnings decreased, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and inflationary pressure on higher manufacturing and logistics costs. These factors were partially offset by the benefit of price increases. Clorox Updates Fiscal Year 2017 EPS Outlook for Revised Tax Rate Assumptions; Expectations For Sales Growth and EBIT Margin Expansion Remain Unchanged 2% to 4% sales growth (unchanged) 25 basis points to 50 basis points of EBIT margin expansion (unchanged) $5.23 to $5.43 diluted EPS range (updated for ASU 2016-09 impact) $5.13 to $5.28, excluding ASU 2016-09 impact (unchanged) Clorox continues to anticipate delivering 2 percent to 4 percent sales growth in fiscal year 2017, reflecting about 2 percentage points of benefit from the RenewLife acquisition, partially offset by about 2 percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of 2 percentage points from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, the company continues to anticipate fiscal year sales to grow between 4 to 6 percent. Clorox continues to anticipate EBIT margin expansion for fiscal year 2017 to be in the range of 25 to 50 basis points, primarily driven by lower selling and administrative expenses, which are expected to be below 14 percent of sales. Clorox now anticipates its effective fiscal year 2017 tax rate to be between 32 percent and 33 percent versus its previous assumption of 30 percent and 31 percent, reflecting a 2-point reduction versus year ago compared to the previously assumed 4-point reduction from adopting ASU 2016-09. The company’s updated assumptions for its fiscal year effective tax rate reflect lower than anticipated exercises of Clorox stock options in the first quarter and the company’s revised outlook for full-year stock option exercises.

Non-GAAP Financial Information This press release contains non-GAAP financial information relating to currency-neutral net sales growth, EBIT and EBIT margin. The company has included reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. See the end of this press release for these reconciliations. The company discloses these non-GAAP financial measures to supplement its consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures provided by other companies due to potential differences in methods of calculation and items being excluded. They should be read in connection with the company’s consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. EBIT represents earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, interest income and interest expense. EBIT margin is the ratio of EBIT to net sales. The company’s management believes these measures provide useful additional information to investors about trends in the company’s operations and are useful for period-over-period comparisons. Currency-neutral net sales growth represents GAAP net sales growth excluding the impact of the change in foreign currency exchange rates. The company’s management believes these measures provide useful additional information to investors about changes in the company’s core business operations without the unpredictability and volatility of currency fluctuations.

The Skin Advisor app, which is already available in the USA and will be coming very soon to the UK, analyses your skin, asks questions about your skincare habits and suggests products to help improve the texture, hydration and tone of your face.  'How can we help?' asks the app solicitously as it loads up the bare-faced picture that I have taken. I cut to the chase and ask it to choose the right products for me. That’s a tough ask for a human expert, unless they know a lot about your skin. But this app is going to have a go, using ‘deep learning’ - a machine-learning algorithm inspired by the way the human brain works. "The app has learned to perceive age and skin flaws by being shown tens of thousands of ageing faces look like," explains Jun Xu, one of the team who created the app at the Procter & Gamble’s Beauty Technology headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio. It learns from its mistakes; slightly scarily, the Skin Advisor now has a better success rate at guessing age from a face than expert dermatologists, who do this sort of thing the whole time. Anti-ageing skincare tips It’s the first time the deep learning algorithm has been used in skincare; other age-predicting programmes such as Microsoft’s ‘How Old do I Look’ facial recognition software, which came under fire last week when it was used to judge, often inaccurately, the ages of child migrants arriving in the UK, use a less sophisticated form of machine learning. After quizzing me about my skincare habits and concerns the app makes its analysis - my forehead is looking good (that may be the Botox) but my mouth area needs help. The verdict: I need a lifting, firming, all-round day cream with SPF from the Regenerist range, the Olay Regenerist 3-Point moisturiser SPF30, £19.99. I love it. Not least because when it eventually comes up with my age, it thinks I’m 40.

Tata, which was at number 4 in 2015 and number 5 in 2014, is ranked at number 7 in India’s Most Attractive Brands 2016 study, carried out by Trust Research Advisory (TRA) and based on primary research conducted on close to 3,000 consumers across 16 cities. However, the ranking was done prior to October 24, when Cyrus Mistry was ousted as the Chairman of Tata group. This year, top the three places were occupied by LG, followed by Sony and Samsung Mobiles, the study said. The fourth placewas bagged by Honda while Samsung ranked fifth. While top five most attractive brands were dominated by foreign firms, homegrown firms Bajaj, Tata and Maruti Suzuki were ranked sixth, seven and eight respectively. Airtel and Nokia took the ninth and tenth spot respectively. In the food and beverage (F&B) category, Amul topped the list out of a total of 156 brands, the report said. Over all, Amul was the 32nd most attractive brand this year. In the sub-category of FMCG diversified, Patanjali pipped Hindustan Unilever (HUL) to be the most the attractive brand. Top five most attractive brands in this category are Patanjali, HUL, Nirma, Emami and Procter & Gamble (P&G). This year’s research was conducted among consumer-influencers across 16 cities, and generated nearly 5 million data points and 10,000 brands, making it the most intensive study on brand attractiveness across the globe.

Could Cincinnati become the city that sleeps better? Anne Saker , asaker@enquirer.com 6:48 p.m. EDT November 3, 2016 Buy Photo Rhinomed's nasal stent comes in two versions: Mute, left, to reduce snoring, and Turbine, for athletes. (Photo: The Enquirer/Anne Saker)Buy Photo An Australian company has planted its U.S. office in Over-the-Rhine with hopes of soon building a staff and a local manufacturing plant dedicated to the belief that the solution to your snoring problem is a little plastic gizmo that you stick up your nose at night. “We could have gone to New York, y’know, the city that never sleeps,” said Michael Johnson, president and chief executive officer of Rhinomed. “But we want to make Cincinnati the city that sleeps better.” Rhinomed of Melbourne, Australia, landed in Cincinnati a year ago with plans to expand in the U.S. market with two versions of its patented nasal stent – for athletes and for sleepers. The company’s website offers the cheeky promise: “Divorce Lawyers Hate it.” Johnson and Shane Duncan, Rhinomed’s vice president of global sales and marketing, said they hope to find property in Southwest Ohio in the next year to build a plant run with robotics, then Rhinomed will bring over at least some manufacturing from China. Bad sleep's a public-health problem Rhinomed’s research shows their stents can open nasal passages and increase airflow as much as 38 percent. More air through the nose can keep a sleeper from mouth breathing, which creates the condition that generates window-rattling snores – driving bed partners into other rooms just to get some sleep. This year, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared insufficient sleep a public health problem. A 2011 CDC survey found that nearly half of Americans report that they snore. It’s not an easy problem to solve. A snorer should seek medical attention to rule out obstructive sleep apnea, where the airway gets blocked during sleep and the sleeper temporarily stops breathing. “Our research is showing that 75 percent of users report getting more air and having their snoring reduced,” Johnson said. The Rhinomed technology is different because the stents can be adjusted for fit, and each stent has a gripper pad that keeps the device in place. Rhinomed first tried its technology with people who need maximum air flow while awake: athletes. That product is called Turbine. U.S. cyclist Kristin Armstrong wore a Turbine while racing to win a gold medal at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. British champion Chris Froome wore a Turbine in three Tour de France victories, and Froome now is a Rhinomed adviser – “that’s why the Turbine is yellow,” Johnson said, in homage to the yellow jersey wore by the leader in the world's most famous bike race. Using a slightly softer polymer than for Turbine, Rhinomed developed Mute, for sleep. Last year, the British chain Boots added Mute to its more than 2,500 pharmacies through the United Kingdom. To roll out the product, Rhinomed gave Mute to the loudest snorer in the United Kingdom, who clocked in at 111 decibels, equal to a low-flying aircraft. After she used the device, her husband proclaimed that he’d finally gotten a few nights of uninterrupted sleep. This year, Rhinomed has sold Mute in the United States through Walgreens and Duane Reade. Each device can be used up to 10 nights. Mute and Turbine come in packs of three, sized small, medium or large, for $27.50. A "starter pack" with one of each size, is $19.95. Growth, Johnson said, has been explosive, and the company’s annual revenue for 2015 was $1.01 million. The idea of nasal stents for snoring is not new, said Dr. Ann Romaker, associate professor of medicine at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine and director of UC Medical Center’s Sleep Medicine Center. “The problem is that many noses are tender,” she said. “I like whatever the patient is comfortable with and is willing to use on a regular basis. I don’t think there’s a one size fits all with any device. Some people do better with Breathe-Right strips, but some people get adhesive burns from that. I think it’s wonderful to have a variety of options.” Next steps for the company When Rhinomed officials decided to open an office in the United States, they looked at both coasts but decided they wanted to be in the middle of the country. At about the same time, Duncan and his wife moved to Cincinnati so that she could take a job with biotech startup Enable Injections, which makes wearable injection devices. Enable Injections is a portfolio company of CincyTech, which is housed in the same Over-the-Rhine building as Cintrifuse. Duncan met Cintrifuse officials, and he and Johnson said they realized Cincinnati was where they wanted Rhinomed to be. “Cintrifuse exists to nurture companies like us,” Johnson said. “We don’t know anywhere else where in the first months, we could talk with people from Kroger or Procter & Gamble or Children’s Hospital.” Naashom Marx, Cintrifuse’s director of customer connections, said Rhinomed probably won’t be in the Union Hall for long. “Definitely, we’re just a launch pad.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News DigitalMR Transforms Customer Insight Through Artificial Intelligence Michalis A. Michael – DigitalMR CEO DigitalMR, a tech company that specialises in Artificial Intelligence for Insights, announced today the ground-breaking results of its 4 year R&D programme. Market research as we know it will be ripped to pieces. This will completely transform the way companies gain insights about their customers. — Michalis Michael, DigitalMR CEO LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM, November 2, 2016 /EINPresswire.com/ — DigitalMR, a London based tech company that specialises in Artificial Intelligence for Customer Insights, announced today the ground-breaking results of its four year research & development programme in the areas of sentiment & semantic analysis, emotion detection, and image theme recognition on social media. The research programme was/is funded by Innovate UK and the EU through seven R&D grants totalling €1.5 million. The EU funding is from Horizon 2020 where DigitalMR is part of a 7 member consortium from Portugal, Spain, Germany and the UK. The specific R&D project is called DiSIEM and DigitalMR’s part is to work on predicting cyber attacks. The general focus of DigitalMR’s research programme is to apply machine learning and artificial intelligence to solve the problem of accuracy when analysing millions of online posts across social media, blogs, fora, news, video, reviews and other websites, in any language. Plainly, DigitalMR can provide insights into anything that is publicly available on the internet. Machine learning is being used by DigitalMR in uncovering unique and accurate insights for any brand, organisation or person. To deliver these results, DigitalMR has developed entirely new proprietary models for recognising a range of emotions, as well as a revolutionary deep learning approach to detect themes and context within images. These new methods are already being used by major global firms to research any subject in any language, anywhere in the world. The implications of these methods will completely transform the way companies conduct market research. The breakthrough research is available through DigitalMR’s proprietary social listening & analytics solution, listening247. The product marks the 3rd generation of social insights solutions and delivers results with over 80% accuracy, in any language. listening247 is a radical departure from the 1,000 social media monitoring tools currently on the market. Michalis Michael, DigitalMR CEO, said: “Market research as we know it will be ripped to pieces. Asking questions in long surveys and focus groups is not enough in a digital economy. We are now able to integrate traditional market research with unsolicited data from social listening and behaviour tracking databases. This will completely transform the way companies gain insights about their customers.” About DigitalMR DigitalMR is a tech company using artificial intelligence with a deep understanding and focus on market research. DigitalMR uses text analytics – Natural Language Processing, sentiment & semantic analysis, emotion detection and scoring, automated image theme and sentiment analysis to deliver deep insights. We work with blue-chip multinationals such as P&G, SABMiller, DIAGEO, Vodafone, Saxo Bank, YPO, Nielsen, TNS, and many more. We are already disrupting a $65 Billion industry. In recent years, DigitalMR has won several grants from the UK government and the EU to conduct R&D.

"Minimizing distractions improves information retention and produces a superior return on investment." The equipment features lightweight headsets that training participants wear to minimize ambient noise or amplify the speaker's voice, complete with individual volume control. The headset design is compatible with hardhat safety requirements in industrial environments. "The most obvious use for a wireless tour guide system is a loud factory environment," Ruffell said.
