How P&G's latest minor sales uptick could strengthen into solid long-term gains. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Oct 6, 2016 at 1:15PM Image source: Getty Images. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) recently gave investors a big reason to feel bullish about its growth outlook. After a long period of flat or declining sales volumes, the company managed upticks across each of its five product divisions last quarter. That improvement led to a sequential increase in organic revenue growth for just the second time in over two years. And if you believe management, P&G is just at the start of what could become a long streak of above-average growth numbers. Let's take a closer look at the consumer goods giant's prospects for a sustained rebound. Recent wins The best news from P&G's most recent quarter was its improving organic growth metric. Sales rose at 2% pace, compared to 1% in the prior quarter. Look deeper and there's even more cause for celebration: The growth was powered by volume gains and not just higher prices. That's important because it suggests robust demand trends that P&G can build on in future quarters.  On the other hand, the company is still having trouble defending its market share from a wide range of competitors. Kimberly-Clark managed 4% higher volume last quarter on its way to a 3% boost in overall organic sales. A 2% volume gain for Unilever, meanwhile, helped it outperform P&G in broad growth, too.  The pessimistic way to read that result would be to knock P&G for losing ground to rivals even during its modest rebound. Yet investors could also see this as good news in that it shows that stronger growth is possible even if the weak global selling environment doesn't improve over the short term. Bright possibilities CEO David Taylor and his executive team believe they can achieve "balanced" growth soon, which they define as strong sales gains paired with healthy improvements in both profits and cash flow.  Investors have a good idea what that would look like. Now that the company's portfolio transformation is complete, P&G is aiming for organic growth that's a full percentage point higher than before -- in addition to a 2-percentage-point improvement in operating margin.  The latest quarter's approach shows how P&G might achieve this aggressively optimistic result. Executives directed cash raised from its massive cost-cutting initiative toward marketing and innovation. The marketing payoff was significant thanks to initiatives like getting trial runs of the latest Gillette razor into the hands of millions of young men, or introducing 70% of new moms to Pampers diapers.  Prepare for a slow rebound Even if this strategy continues to work, investors shouldn't expect a quick return to market-thumping growth. P&G projects that the next 12 months will bring organic gains of 2%. Sure, that's a solid improvement over last year's 1% uptick, but it still implies flat or shrinking market share across much of the portfolio.  With shares  near all-time highs, investors are betting that Procter & Gamble is on the cusp of a prolonged growth rebound. In any case, it's very likely that the company will produce higher profits and a significant boost in cash flow. Those wins at least will power surging cash returns to shareholders over the next few years. But for a new growth trajectory to take hold, P&G will need to show several consecutive quarters of positive sales volumes -- ideally leading to overall organic growth that matches or exceeds that of its global rivals. A change of that magnitude isn't easy for a $240 billion business like P&G's. However, with the help of a revamped portfolio and major investments in the operations, the company has its best chance in years at speeding up its sales gains.

Opera's 2017 festival mixes old favorites, new wave Janelle Gelfand , jgelfand@enquirer.com 2:40 p.m. EDT October 6, 2016 In this production of "The Magic Flute" for Los Angeles Opera, Papagena (Amanda Woodbury) and Papageno (Rodion Pogossov) finally find one another. (Photo: Provided/Robert Millard/LA Opera) Cincinnati Opera’s 2017 Summer Festival will include two grand operas: “La Boheme” conducted by Louis Langrée in his company debut, and a whimsical production of “The Magic Flute” on the Procter & Gamble stage at the Aronoff Center. Also on tap will be the company premiere of “Frida,” an opera about Mexican artist Frida Kahlo by Robert Xavier Rodriguez, in the smaller Jarson-Kaplan Theater at the Aronoff Center. And there is a unique collaboration planned with the Cincinnati ensemble concert:nova of “Song from the Uproar,” by the fast-rising American composer Missy Mazzoli. It will be separately ticketed as a special event. The 2017 Summer Festival will be Cincinnati Opera's second season at the Aronoff Center, while its home, Music Hall, undergoes an extensive renovation. The three-production series (including one in the smaller theater) is a reduction from the 2016 season’s three grand operas and the world premiere of "Fellow Travelers" in the Jarson-Kaplan Theater. The company explained that it has offered a three-opera series – as opposed to its longtime tradition of four – on occasions such as the 2010 season, when it had the extensive production demands of Wagner’s “Die Meistersinger.” Next year, Mozart’s “The Magic Flute” will be the blockbuster production, coming from Komische Oper Berlin. Cincinnati Opera is also expanding its single-ticket offerings with four performances each of “La Boheme” and “The Magic Flute.” Puccini’s “La Boheme” will open the season (June 15, 17, 22 and 24) in Procter & Gamble Hall. A co-production with English National Opera, it is set in the 1930s and was last seen at Cincinnati Opera in 2010. Nicole Cabell, who recently starred as Rosalinde in “Die Fledermaus,” will sing the role of Mimi. Soprano Jessica Rivera will perform the role of Musetta. Sean Panikkar will make his company debut as Rodolfo. The other bohemians include Edward Nelson as Schaunard, Rodion Pogossov as Marcello and Nathan Stark as Colline. Langrée, music director of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, will make his company debut leading his own orchestra in the pit. Natascha Metherell is stage director. And the company will continue its partnership with Cincinnati Boychoir, which will provide the boys' chorus in "La Boheme." “Frida,” a 1991 opera in Spanish about the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo by Robert Xavier Rodriguez, will be presented in seven performances June 23-July 8 in Jarson-Kaplan Theater. Kahlo's short, painful life and tempestuous marriage to the muralist Diego Rivera (to be sung by Ricardo Herrera) became well-known after the 2002 movie, “Frida.” The production, created for Michigan Opera Theatre in 2015, will star Catalina Cuervo as the portrait artist. Jose Maria Condemi will return to stage the opera. Andrés Cladera conducts. The season concludes with Mozart’s “The Magic Flute,” July 15, 20, 22 and 23 in Procter & Gamble Hall. Created for The Komische Oper Berlin, the production was described by Berliner Morgenpost as “a deliciously absurd mixture of silent film and cartoon." Besides Germany, the production has appeared in Los Angeles and Minneapolis. The unique concept is by Barrie Kosky and “1927,” a London-based company that specializes in combining performance and live music with animation and film. It will be sung in German.

Matthew/LA Opera) The large cast includes Aaron Blake as Tamino, Kim-Lillian Strebel as Pamina, Jeni Houser as Queen of the Night, Tom McNichols as Sarastro, Rodion Pogossov as Papageno and Alexandra Schoeny as the First Lady. (Other cast members will be announced.) Daniel Ellis directs and Christopher Allen, Cincinnati Opera’s resident conductor, will conduct. In a special presentation, Mazzoli’s “Song from the Uproar” will be mounted in collaboration with concert:nova July 17, 19 and 21 in the Aronoff Center's Fifth Third Bank Theater. The libretto is by Royce Vavrek. Cincinnati Opera will kick off its 2017 season with a free, Spanish-themed program on June 11 in Washington Park, featuring stars from the mainstage season. The company is also planning its signature programs such as Back to the Zoo, Opera Goes to Church and Temple and other events. The Summer Festival will return to Music Hall and its “Opera Campus” surrounding Washington Park in 2018. Subscription renewals will go on sale this month, with new subscriptions available in November. Single tickets will go on sale in Spring, 2017.

SUBSCRIBE PPC + SEO = match made in marketing heaven Are your SEO and PPC teams working in silos? Columnist Julian Connors discusses several ways SEO and PPC can combine efforts to improve their strategies and drive more conversions. Julian Connors on October 6, 2016 at 10:23 am More It has been quite a year for the Search Engine Results Page (SERP). We’ve seen numerous algorithm updates, including a final Penguin update and the introduction of Possum. We also saw major changes to the way ads are displayed on desktop SERPs. Google continues to tweak how online consumers receive content through organic and paid listings. In order to meet the demands of today’s search landscape and connect with more qualified consumers, strategists need to create campaigns that treat SEO and PPC as a unified silo, as opposed to separate disciplines. Google’s never-ending quest for SERP perfection The ongoing adjustments to the SERP layout are meant to help Google better align with consumer objectives by improving the content quality and relevance of listings. While this certainly allows Google to become a better service provider for online consumers, it also presents new challenges for SEO strategists. Each adjustment requires strategists to develop new methods for ranking within prime search listings. Integrating SEO with PPC Developing digital marketing campaigns that combine SEO with PPC is not only necessary for achieving prime listing positions, it’s now the only way to maximize traffic and conversion opportunities. As the former Organic Search Manager for a Fortune 500 brand that specializes in home care, I was responsible for developing comprehensive, complex digital campaigns that focused on consumer behavior alignment and conversion optimization. When our team made the effort to combine both SEO and PPC strategies/data, we were able to identify a multitude of critical data points dedicated to consumer behavior, intentions and location/geography. This level of precision allowed us to: modify our organic keyword strategy so that we could create and optimize new content to rank within specific geographic locations, applying exact phrases used by our target audience to align with their intentions; adjust our PPC budgets so that we were only running ads within the most popular markets and effective time frames; and align our PPC ads with their offline marketing schedule to maximize awareness and conversions. Overall, these actions resulted in: 30-percent increase in organic traffic 25-percent increase in paid clicks 35-percent savings in ad spend 20-percent increase in quarterly profits Sharing information to create one rockstar team Most digital marketing agencies are built with SEO and PPC sitting on opposite sides of the building. Both teams work tirelessly, developing keyword strategies, creating unique content and employing a number of tactics that focus on attracting online consumers. Even though each team uses different systems and tactics to drive conversions, there is a tremendous amount of critical data that can be used to create a synergistic and harmonious relationship, bolstering results for everyone. Check out the following ways that SEO and PPC can combine efforts to improve their strategies, as well as to drive conversions like never before. Share keyword data to increase the intelligence of your campaigns Keywords are the foundation for any successful SEO or PPC campaign. For PPC strategists, keywords are used to facilitate creative relationships with consumers who are located further down the conversion funnel. In the world of SEO, keywords are used to dictate the information architecture of a website, as well as its content strategy. Both teams conduct keyword research in order to identify terms that align with their target audience’s online behavior, project traffic growth and drive qualified conversions. Because more consumers are using long-tail phrases and complete sentences when searching than ever before, keyword data must be shared across both teams in order to offer coordinated messages that keep brands top-of-mind and solicit qualified conversions. Set shared goals and combine metrics Using the information both teams collect doesn’t just offer more accuracy around consumer behavior; it can also be used to support your brand’s inbound marketing campaigns. Teams that combine their PPC data with organic user engagement metrics (e.g., average session duration, bounce rate, pages per session) are able to gain unique insight around how consumers are interacting with certain digital properties, as well as how they behave once they leave your site. The metrics your SEO and PPC teams review in order to establish their key performance indicators (KPIs) should be almost identical. When this happens, you are able to apply this information to other marketing channels like PR, social media or email marketing. Remove silos to improve production Approaching SEO and PPC as two separate silos isolates critical information and diminishes the productivity level of even the most well-executed online campaigns. It almost never makes sense to keep these two disciplines apart, as the teams can offer each other particular points of information that are vital for identifying and fulfilling conversion opportunities. Use data that informs cross-channel decisions and justifies action When it comes to gathering enough actionable data to develop robust, intelligent strategies, extracting information from one specific field, like SEO or PPC, is not enough. Although the quality of your organic data may provide insight on how to create functional plans, the amount of verified information organic search can capture may not be sufficient to justify real action. Conversely, information that’s gathered from the search engines themselves as a result of paid search activity is both valuable and based on a substantial sample size that allows you to move forward confidently. If your organization treats SEO and PPC as two distinct entities, try to make sure that your efforts are aligned through shared: reporting; objectives; and communication portals. The goal of merging both disciplines together is not to have the same people performing the same type of work. Instead, it is meant to increase internal awareness of key conversion opportunities. Action & impact: how to maximize SERP visibility Now that we have covered the principles that allow your SEO and PPC teams to work together efficiently, use the following tactics to own as much real estate within Google SERPs as possible. Landing page optimization Optimizing your landing pages to drive qualified traffic and conversions is a fundamental component of any digital marketing campaign. SEO strategists can provide their PPC counterparts with critical information around consumer intentions, objectives and demands to reduce bounce rate and increase click-through-rates (CTR). PPC strategists can then use their insights around consumer online activity to perpetuate paid ads that only appear in front of the most qualified consumers possible. By doing this, both teams are able to support each other in ways that improve user experience, maximize relevant traffic and reduce wasted ad spend. Approach SEO & PPC holistically Running paid ad campaigns that 1) offer precise messages and 2) are located next to your organic listings on Google can increase overall CTR and lead to a higher return on your investment. While managing the online campaign of Sonos in 2015, our team ran paid ads alongside keywords that the electronics company already ranked for organically. This type of positioning was extremely effective for creating the sense that we were more prominent than our competitors and thus, more credible. Because of this, total revenue through organic and paid channels increased by 37 percent year over year. Understand seasonality Share seasonal data and information relating to other offline variables to learn how to approach and optimize for specific times throughout the year when consumer activity peaks. Use this information to create a calendar of events that guides you on how to: create organic content that aligns with specific consumers within specific locations; run paid ads that contain unique messaging based on location and intention; maximize brand awareness during peak activity points like the holiday shopping season; and increase consumer reaction and conversions during seasonal low points. Get in front of the competition SEO and PPC strategists should work together as a cohesive unit to share key points of information that highlight how and what the competition is doing from a digital perspective. Create monitoring systems that identify your competitors in terms of: positioning within SERPs; pricing; key message points/branding initiatives; and primary and secondary keyword terms. Use this information to adjust your ad spend, to improve CTR and to outrank your opponents by taking up more real estate within SERPs.

The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. ×
Skip to content Beet.TV Search for: Don’t Vacate The Top Of The Funnel, Nielsen’s Solomon Tells Marketers   By Robert Andrews on October 7, 2016October 7, 2016 @robertandrews Pretty much the whole of the advertising technology world these days seems to focus around targeting. The better the targeting, the better the results, many people believe. So when the world’s largest advertising spender pulls back from targeted ads on one of the world’s largest ad platforms, people take notice. That’s what Procter & Gamble did this summer, when its chief brand officer declared it would change its Facebook strategy: “We targeted too much, and we went too narrow. And now we’re looking at: What is the best way to get the most reach but also the right precision?” That is a pivot media measurement house Nielsen’s product leadership SVP Eric Solomon endorses. “The underlying notion is, targeting may be a great tactic to drive certain metrics,” Solomon tells Beet.TV, in this video interview. “But, when you’re a brand advertiser, you can’t forget the top of the funnel. “You need to have ad campaigns that are geared toward driving the metrics that matter to you as a brand. It is not all about finding that specific target audience that already knows about you.” P&G’s CEO said it would “get back to making consumers aware of its products and communicating their benefits”. Marketing theory holds that a typical “purchase funnel” begins with sparking the initial interest of consumer prospects before leading them through consideration to purchase.   This video is part of Beet.TV’s coverage of the IAB MIXX Conference, 2016, presented by The TradeDesk.

And not just any soccer fan, of course. MLS Commissioner Don Garber is paying a visit to the Queen City on Nov 29 when FC Cincinnati's highly-aspirational owners will aim to show him that their club - and indeed their city - deserve a Major League Soccer team. Garber recently announced that MLS plans to expand to 28 teams and, assuming Miami will gain the 24th spot (though this is far from a given), FC Cincinnati have quickly become one of the favourites to land one of the remaining four places. Competition is tough, however, with Garber making recent visits to Sacramento and Detroit, and St Louis also in the reckoning. That possibly leaves just one place to fight for - and even with expansion fees potentially rising to $200 million - FC Cincinnati, with their amazing attendances, want to show Garber why they stand out from the crowd. Tonight's attendance for #CINvCHS is a new #FCCincy AND @USL record... pic.twitter.com/0R52v5cmX5— FC Cincinnati (@fccincinnati) October 2, 2016 "Soccer is the most popular sport in the world and it's catching up in the United States. It's a sport on the rise and, guess what, Cincinnati is a city on the rise," FC Cincinnati general manager Jeff Berding told The Telegraph.  "We're a very hot city right now - for jobs, businesses, arts and entertainment, the population is growing. We're one of the top cities for new graduates, we're growing our international presence both in companies and people from other parts of the world coming to Cincinnati.  "FC Cincinnati is riding the wave of a city on the rise and a sport on the rise - our timing was perfect and I think we're really demonstrating how soccer is experiencing tremendous growth in the United States and the future is only going to be greater." He added: "[Commissioner Garber] is coming for a full day. Everyone who is familiar with soccer knows that if FC Cincinnati is drawing 20-30,000 paid spectators there must be something going in Cincinnati. So we're going to show him the city.  "We're going to show him first-hand a lot of the development that is growing in the urban core that coincides with an appeal for soccer.  "We're going to see the facilities at Nippert Stadium that meet high standards and will continue to be enhanced and improved.  "There is an opportunity to have a Town Hall meeting with our supporters, similar to what the Commissioner has done in other cities.  "And there will be a chance for some of the business leaders in town - Procter & Gamble and some the Fortune 500 companies that are based here in Cincinnati - to hear about their thoughts on Cincinnati being possibly some day a MLS city." FC Cincinnati have shattered all kinds of attendance records in their first season in the third tier United Soccer League. An incredible 35,000 people came to Nippert Stadium in July  to see their friendly against Crystal Palace and last weekend they drew 30,187 for their play-off match with Charleston Battery, which was nearly 10,000 more than the previous best - 20,886 set by Orlando City in the 2013 USL Cup Final. Best of luck in your first ever play off match, @fccincinnati! 🔴🔵 #RiseTogether pic.twitter.com/AZz7bOJihM— Crystal Palace F.C. (@CPFC) October 2, 2016 As impressive as these attendances are, Berding knows that FC Cincinnati still need to improve the club's entire infrastructure to help make the case to Garber. Much of what he intends to do came from meetings with MLS officials at the All-Star Game this summer and principally include developing their youth programme and training facilities. The club also plan to  make soccer-specific renovations to Nippert, notably widening the pitch. "I said on Sunday that  the loss in the play-offs was not the end of the FC Cincinnati but the beginning, it was just the end of chapter one," Berding added. "We showed up bright and early on Monday to start chapter two. We're not going to stop until we're lifting trophies and playing at the highest level available to us here. "We have to be better at everything we do. We won 16 games, we came in third, but we weren't good enough and we didn't get through the play-offs and have a chance of winning the cup.  "John [Harkes, the head coach] and I are meeting with the players and we will go through an evaluation process on everything we do - from the front office, the medical staff, the coaching staff and the players so that we can have an even better club next year.  "We'll have an advantage in that we'll not be building from scratch. Our core is very strong, I think we showed from what we do our standards are very high. "We're going to grow more season ticket holders. We're renewing at a 99% per cent renewal rate. We're looking at 8,000 tickets and the off-season is only three days old. I think 10,000 season tickets will be attainable and that will show a sustainability about what we're trying to get done.  "We averaged a 17,000 attendance this year - let's average 20,000 next year. We're going to do better with sponsorships, we're going to do better with broadcasts - this year we put all our home games on TV, next year we're going to look at putting all our games on TV, including road games." The Bailey is here in force for the #WhiteOut! pic.twitter.com/2UXqO6J8Ho— FC Cincinnati (@fccincinnati) October 2, 2016 FC Cincinnati are also making waves internationally, too, and following the hugely popular friendly with Palace, Berding is coming to England in late October to try to set up another. "I have some folks setting up some meetings for me, some clubs have expressed an interest in us in doing some things. We'll see if there's any opportunities to do things in December-March or coming up to the new season in May or in July as we did with Palace. "We'll consider taking the team on the road. We've been an enormous story in the soccer world. We epitomise the growth of soccer in the United States. We're a city with no real soccer history of any magnitude and out of the blue achieving what we've achieved shows the growth of the sport in the US." It is possible that all the improvements - and costly ones, too - FC Cincinnati are making will be for little if it does not lead to a MLS invitation. But Berding does not see it that way, his intention is simply to make FC Cincinnati "the best professional franchise we can be". "Cincinnati is a major league sports town," he adds. "We're in a league that is very aspirational, a lot of USL teams moved to MLS and we look to follow in their footsteps. Having said that, we're respectful that  MLS will have their own process and timeline and we know we will have to earn their confidence and the opportunity to be invited. .@fccincinnati GM and former Councilmember Jeff Berding says soccer, Cincinnati are "on the rise." #FCCincy #fccday pic.twitter.com/TjPWnuGkX1— City of Cincinnati (@CityOfCincy) October 5, 2016 "We're very happy in the USL. You had a team like Orlando City, it took them five years to move up and other teams it took longer. We're not impatient by any means but having said that there's a lot to like about Cincinnati.  "We have an ownership that has the resources to make the jump, a professional venue with 35,000 seats with suites and premium seats. I think the management of our team has shown to be of high standards and the support from the market is I think second to none when you look at other expansion contenders.  "We're very bullish on Cincinnati. It's a great market. We've proven it this year and we're going to improve on it next year. Ultimately, the MLS will have its own process and we're going to give it our best shot." Wednesday marked FC Cincinnati Day in the Queen City to mark the team's achievements on and off the field in their inaugural season.  City officials will need to come up with an even grander celebration should FC Cincinnati gain that coveted MLS place.

The German company spent $3.6 billion in June to acquire Sun Products, which was created in 2008 via a private-equity-backed spinoff from Unilever operations in Trumbull. Henkel has its North American headquarters in Rocky Hill, where it had about 420 jobs, according to the most recent records on file with the state of Connecticut. With Sun already employing about 200 people in Wilton, Henkel will create an additional 266 jobs in the state, according to the office of Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, giving the governor another significant economic development win after an announcement last month about an agreement to keep the headquarters of Lockheed Martin subsidiary Sikorsky Aircraft in Stratford. Henkel’s consumer goods headquarters has been located in Scottsdale, Ariz., but with the recent acquisition of Sun Products, the company has decided to combine those operations in Stamfordt. Some 375 Arizona employees will be offered the option of relocating to Connecticut, according to the Phoenix Business Journal. Stamford has several office buildings with available space to accommodate the number of people Henkel is bringing together there, including downtown offices formerly occupied by UBS and General Reinsurance, and the sprawling former headquarters of Pitney Bowes in the city’s South End. With brands like All, Snuggle and Wisk, Sun Products is the second-largest seller of laundry products in North America; the market is dominated by Procter & Gamble. In the Henkel move from Arizona, Stamford will assume status as the head office for Dial soaps, one of many Henkel personal care and beauty products sold on store shelves coast to coast, as well as a broad portfolio of adhesives, sealants and surface treatments for consumer and industrial use. “The decision to relocate is a result of our evolving business needs and we are thankful to Arizona and its leaders for many years of partnership and support in the community,” said Jens-Martin Schwaerzler, president of Henkel’s North American consumer goods division, in a written statement. “We are looking forward to the future, building on our more than 20-year partnership with the leaders and communities of Connecticut.” To fund the move, the company will participate in the state’s First Five Plus program, which is operated under the state Department of Economic and Community Development. Under the program, the company will receive a 10-year, $20 million low-interest loan toward the relocation. It may also be eligible for up to $5 million in tax credits through the Urban and Industrial Sites Reinvestment Tax Credit program, which allows for a corporate tax credit of up to 100 percent of capital investment. “When an international company of Henkel’s stature decides to relocate to our state, expand its operations, and create hundreds of new jobs, it sends a message to the rest of the world that Connecticut is serious about working with companies to grow, generate capital investment, and strengthen our economy for the residents of our state,” Malloy stated. “Henkel is a valued member of the business community. We are proud of their decision to relocate and expand in Connecticut and we welcome the company to our state.” Henkel expects the relocation of its operations will start in the second quarter of 2017, with the process completed by the first quarter of 2018. It has yet to pick a specific site in Stamford. “This is just another example of the positive business environment found here in the state of Connecticut and is reflective of Henkel’s confidence in Connecticut’s workforce talent,” Stamford Mayor David Martin said in a statement. “The city of Stamford has taken steps over the last few years to create a business climate that attracts companies like Henkel. I look forward to working with them as a corporate citizen for years to come.” State Sen. Carlo Leone, D-Stamford, said Henkel’s decision to move is just the latest company to bet on Connecticut and it shows the state is on the right path. “Just last week I voted for an agreement that will keep Sikorsky in Connecticut where they will grow and create new jobs,” he said in a statement. “Pratt and Whitney and Electric Boat have also announced their intention to each create thousands of new jobs in Connecticut. Henkel is just the latest piece of good news showing that Connecticut’s economy is moving toward a much stronger future.” Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW 60 Servings of MuscleTech Hydroxycut Elite for $20 + $6 s&h Bodybuilding.comPosted 13 hr 1 min ago SHOP NOW Eastwood Rust Encapsulator 15-oz.

We are proud of their decision to relocate and expand in Connecticut and we welcome the company to our state.” Henkel expects the relocation of its operations will start in the second quarter of 2017, with the process completed by the first quarter of 2018. It has yet to pick a specific site in Stamford. “This is just another example of the positive business environment found here in the state of Connecticut and is reflective of Henkel’s confidence in Connecticut’s workforce talent,” Stamford Mayor David Martin said in a statement. “The city of Stamford has taken steps over the last few years to create a business climate that attracts companies like Henkel. I look forward to working with them as a corporate citizen for years to come.” State Sen. Carlo Leone, D-Stamford, said Henkel’s decision to move is just the latest company to bet on Connecticut and it shows the state is on the right path. “Just last week I voted for an agreement that will keep Sikorsky in Connecticut where they will grow and create new jobs,” he said in a statement. “Pratt and Whitney and Electric Boat have also announced their intention to each create thousands of new jobs in Connecticut. Henkel is just the latest piece of good news showing that Connecticut’s economy is moving toward a much stronger future.” Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW Rev-A-Shelf Pull Out Shelf Filler for $75 + free shipping Jet.comPosted 13 hr 14 min ago SHOP NOW Rx Sunglasses Lenses at Glasses USA: free w/ frames purchase +...

The German company spent $3.6 billion in June to acquire Sun Products, which was created in 2008 via a private-equity-backed spinoff from Unilever operations in Trumbull. Henkel has its North American headquarters in Rocky Hill, where it had about 420 jobs, according to the most recent records on file with the state of Connecticut. With Sun already employing about 200 people in Wilton, Henkel will create an additional 266 jobs in the state, according to the office of Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, giving the governor another significant economic development win after an announcement last month about an agreement to keep the headquarters of Lockheed Martin subsidiary Sikorsky Aircraft in Stratford. Henkel’s consumer goods headquarters has been located in Scottsdale, Ariz., but with the recent acquisition of Sun Products, the company has decided to combine those operations in Stamfordt. Some 375 Arizona employees will be offered the option of relocating to Connecticut, according to the Phoenix Business Journal. Stamford has several office buildings with available space to accommodate the number of people Henkel is bringing together there, including downtown offices formerly occupied by UBS and General Reinsurance, and the sprawling former headquarters of Pitney Bowes in the city’s South End. With brands like All, Snuggle and Wisk, Sun Products is the second-largest seller of laundry products in North America; the market is dominated by Procter & Gamble. In the Henkel move from Arizona, Stamford will assume status as the head office for Dial soaps, one of many Henkel personal care and beauty products sold on store shelves coast to coast, as well as a broad portfolio of adhesives, sealants and surface treatments for consumer and industrial use. “The decision to relocate is a result of our evolving business needs and we are thankful to Arizona and its leaders for many years of partnership and support in the community,” said Jens-Martin Schwaerzler, president of Henkel’s North American consumer goods division, in a written statement. “We are looking forward to the future, building on our more than 20-year partnership with the leaders and communities of Connecticut.” To fund the move, the company will participate in the state’s First Five Plus program, which is operated under the state Department of Economic and Community Development. Under the program, the company will receive a 10-year, $20 million low-interest loan toward the relocation. It may also be eligible for up to $5 million in tax credits through the Urban and Industrial Sites Reinvestment Tax Credit program, which allows for a corporate tax credit of up to 100 percent of capital investment. “When an international company of Henkel’s stature decides to relocate to our state, expand its operations, and create hundreds of new jobs, it sends a message to the rest of the world that Connecticut is serious about working with companies to grow, generate capital investment, and strengthen our economy for the residents of our state,” Malloy stated. “Henkel is a valued member of the business community.

This year the board of directors voted to move it to the fall hoping to have a better turnout. They figured the summer was not a good time since there are family vacations. In the fall, everyone has returned to bowling and beginning the new season. Reasoning had it that award winners were more available then. The night for the long-awaited annual awards banquet is almost here. It will be held October 15 at Holiday Lanes in Westport, catered by New Bedford’s Riccardi’s Italian Restaurant. Hopefully, the fall will be the perfect time to celebrate and say farewell to the preceding season. Ticket sales so far have been lackluster, though, and there is still time to purchase tickets. The banquet will begin at 6:30 p.m. with cocktails, followed by the buffet. After the meal, the awards will be presented. For the first time in the history of the banquet, the association and Holiday Lanes in Westport will offer a fun bowling tournament following the awards presentation. The tournament will be a nine-pin no-tap format featuring a red pin that will turn up somewhere in the pin setup. If the red pin appears as the head pin and the bowler gets a strike, a (small) prize will be given. Children will be allowed to bowl for free, but will not be eligible for prizes. The awards portion of the banquet will feature presentation of handsome plaques engraved by Chadwick’s Trophies in New Bedford to the bowlers who bowled 300 games, 800 series and women’s 700 series during the 2015-16 season. Also, winners of each event in the association tournament that was held last March at AMF Somerset Lanes will also receive a plaque. Bowlers of the Year in four separate categories will be honored. The first one is Bowler of the Year which is the Jim Rusin Memorial Bowler of the Year award sponsored by the Rusin family. This year’s Bowler of the Year happens to be Jim’s twin brother, John Rusin. The female Bowler of the Year is Amy Robinson. Her award is sponsored by P&G Corporation, owners of Wonder Bowl, Holiday Lanes in Westport and E. Providence Lanes. The Senior Bowler of the Year is Charlie McConnell. His award is the Dave “The Bear” Senior Bowler of the Year which is sponsored by the Charette family in memory of their brother who was an avid bowler and passed too early at a young age. The final Bowler of the Year award is the Super Senior award. Paul Moser earned the honor which is sponsored by the (Brett) O’Connor family. The highlight of each year’s awards banquet is the induction of bowlers into the SMUSBC Hall of Fame and this season is no different. The 2016 Hall of Fame Class includes three talented and well-deserving bowlers - Alex Aguiar, Jonathan Van Hees and Joey Nereu - all inducted for bowling ability. Tickets to the event are $25 and for the optional bowling tournament, there’s a $10 entry fee. For tickets, contact Stephanie Millward, banquet chairman, at 508-730-7715, as soon as possible. Bowling tournament tickets will be available for purchase at the banquet. The SMUSBC Board of Directors looks forward to seeing you there and helping to make this year’s banquet a memorable occasion. UPCOMING EVENTS The Massachusetts State USBC Youth Association 34th annual Singles Tournament is November 6 at Westgate Lanes in Brockton. Entry fee is $25 per bowler and entries close on October 16. Entry forms may be downloaded from www.mausbcya.org. The Massachusetts Women’s Bowling Association 36th annual State Senior Tournament is November 5-6 at Town Line Luxury Lanes in Malden. Entry fee is $40 per bowler and entries close on October 21. Entry forms are available at all area tenpin centers. HIGHLIGHTS Correction to an item in last Sunday’s (Sept. 25) column: It was incorrectly reported that Evan Thro was fourth in the Junior Bowling Sport Challenge in Auburn in the under 15 division. He was actually in fifth place and Sam Blanchette was fourth. Jeff Palmer, in the Westport Trios League at Holiday Lanes in Westport, bowled an 805 series that included a 299 and a 289 game. Jamie Travassos, in the Junior Program at Holiday Lanes in Westport, bowled a career-high 299 game that was 104 pins over his average on Sept. 24.

VA issues with med schools go beyond Cincinnati Anne Saker , asaker@enquirer.com 11:37 a.m. EDT October 7, 2016 Buy Photo The difficulties in the relationship between the Cincinnati VA, the UC College of Medicine and UC Health are not new around the country. (Photo: The Enquirer/Anne Saker)Buy Photo Over 70 years, a relationship inevitably develops issues: communication miscues, struggles over who’s in charge of the money or the work, debates about who’s taking advantage of whom. This year, the Department of Veterans Affairs marked the 70th anniversary of its official relationship with medical schools across the country. Army Gen. Omar Bradley forged the alliance in the aftermath of World War II: The VA had a flood of patients but not enough doctors; medical schools were producing doctors who needed to see patients as a way to gather clinical experience. Today, 65 percent of all U.S. physicians have gotten at least part of their training, arranged through their medical school, with the VA. VA and medical school officials praise the relationship as a win-win situation for everyone. In February, William Ball, dean of the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, came to a news conference at the Cincinnati VA Medical Center to say the medical school is “very proud” of its VA affiliation. But turbulence at the Cincinnati VA Medical Center this year indicates that fractures are putting major stress on the longstanding marriage between the VA and the 124 medical schools with which it is affiliated. Cincinnati’s situation, while unusual, is not unique. Investigations by the VA's inspector general and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) have revealed difficulties in the VA's relationship with medical schools and teaching hospitals, which often have different goals than the VA. The problems between the VA and the medical schools are turning up in numerous ways. For example: The VA appears to have lost control over its contracts with affiliated medical schools and medical practices to provide doctors to treat VA patients. In June, an oversight panel of the House Veterans Affairs Committee held a hearing to review a report from the GAO, the independent watchdog that investigates for Congress how the federal government spends taxpayer dollars. The report said the VA takes three years to develop a long-term contract with an affiliate. VA officials do not get enough training to negotiate contracts. Some VAs have stopped trying to write long-term contracts and now bounce along from one expensive short-term contract after another. The VA doesn't seem to know how to diagnose or treat its problems with medical schools. At the June hearing, members of Congress questioned Dr. Robert Jesse, head of the VA’s Office of Academic Affiliations about an August 2015 inspector general’s report that at the VA hospital in Pittsburgh, surgeons from the affiliated University of Pittsburgh Physicians had overbilled the VA. In one instance, the doctors’ group billed the VA for every hour in one entire month. When committee members challenged Jesse about getting that money back, Jesse responded that he wasn’t sure he had the authority to do so. The VA isn’t getting the credit or the financial benefits for research breakthroughs that doctors achieve on VA time with VA resources. Dr. Raymond Schinazi, for example, worked for the VA Medical Center in Atlanta and at Emory University. During his career, Schinazi developed a cure for the liver infection hepatitis C in a private laboratory he owned. In August 2015, he won an award from the VA for research. In January, he retired from the VA and sold the lab and the drug to a drug company in 2011 for $400 million. The VA got nothing. VA patients sometimes need to go out in the community to get care, typically at higher cost. In 2014, the VA spent $7 billion in “non-VA care” – a 160 percent increase in less than 10 years. Unlike Medicare and Medicaid, which contract with medical systems to deliver care, much of the non-VA care for veterans is authorized individually – an expensive method of care that VA officials acknowledge needs improvement. In Cincinnati, the VA spends about $40 million a year in non-VA care with UC Health. The Cincinnati VA’s issue strikes at the heart of the relationship between the VA and its affiliated medical partners. In Cincinnati, more than 30 doctors, nurses and other caregivers complained to VA Secretary Robert McDonald of Indian Hill, former chairman of Procter & Gamble, that VA hospital management was cutting corners to save money, causing “near misses” in patient care. When the complaints went public in February, the VA demoted the Cincinnati VA’s acting chief of staff to a data-entry job in the hospital basement while an inspector general’s review was launched into the complaints. In turn, the acting chief of staff, Dr. Barbara Temeck, a career VA doctor and administrator, accused officials of the UC College of Medicine and the nonprofit, UC Health, of steering patients away from the VA and of dominating how VA doctors practice medicine and conduct research -- often to the detriment of the Cincinnati VA. On Monday, a special VA administrative investigative board, separate from the inspector general’s review, arrived in Cincinnati to look into Temeck’s allegations about the UC-VA relationship. She was the first witness to speak with the board, which is expected to interview other Cincinnati VA officials. The board most likely will need several months to reach any conclusions. 10 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2dRweJg TOP VIDEOS Sam DuBose sister: 'This, to me, is murder' 1:30 Protests in Cincinnati after Ray Tensing mistrial 1:09 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Mistrial declared in Ray Tensing case 3:46 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 Cincinnati Police Criminalist: Tensing 'seemed nervous or afraid' 2:59 Crime lab: No evidence on Tensing’s boots that he was dragged 4:07 Alternate juror in Ray Tensing trial has been dismissed 1:24 Lakota East's Horter wins state cross country 2:58 Born in Cincinnati, celebrated around the world: An anthem that unites us 3:39 Division I volleyball regional semifinals 1:46 More Stories Who the heck is Marilyn Z?

Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Oct 7, 2016 at 9:34AM Image source: Motley Fool. Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) doesn't sound like the most exciting growth stock around. After all, the company makes most of its sales and profits by selling mundane products such as toothpaste, soap, and pet food. Nevertheless, slow and steady sometimes wins the race: Colgate-Palmolive has produced impressive returns for investors over the years, and it still has a lot to offer going forward. A global market leader Colgate-Palmolive operates in multiple consumer staples segments, such as shampoo, shower gels, deodorants, and pet food, among several others. However, the lion's share of the business comes from oral care, where Colgate-Palmolive is an undisputed leader on a global scale. According to management, the company owns 43.9% of the toothpaste market around the world, with a special focus on emerging markets: Colgate-Palmolive has a market share of 73.3% in the Brazilian toothpaste market, 79.9% in Mexico, and it owns 53.4% of the market in India.  Image source: Colgate-Palmolive. The company is a pioneer when it comes to international expansion. Colgate-Palmolive entered Mexico in 1925, Brazil in 1927, and India in 1937. This first-mover advantage has been enormously beneficial for shareholders; Colgate-Palmolive now has a presence in 223 countries, with more than 75% of sales coming from international markets and over 50% of revenue produced in emerging markets. Image source: Colgate-Palmolive. The company has built long-standing relationships with dental care professionals around the world -- Colgate is recommended by 47% of dentists worldwide. This is a major advantage when it comes to brand recognition. Besides, specialized toothpaste generally carries premium prices and above-average profit margins, so Colgate-Palmolive's relationship with dentists has positive implications in terms of profitability, too. Translating competitive strength into profitability Solid competitive strengths are the key to sustained profitability over the long term. In addition to brand differentiation, Colgate-Palmolive enjoys cost advantages due to its massive scale and wide geographical reach. Besides, the company has abundant financial resources to invest in key areas such as marketing and advertising or research and development, which sets it apart from smaller competitors trying to steal market share away.  The company is facing economic headwinds in many of the main emerging markets where it operates, but financial performance remains solid as of the second quarter of 2016. Colgate-Palmolive reported a 5.4% increase in organic sales during the period, while adjusted gross profit margin grew 190 basis points year over year, to 60.2% of revenue. Management is doing a sound job at generating increasing profitability for investors, as gross profit margin is consistently moving in the right direction over the last couple of decades.  Image source: Colgate-Palmolive. On the back of solid competitive strength and attractive financial performance, the stock has downright crushed the market over time. Over the 20-year period ended in 2015, Colgate-Palmolive has delivered an accumulated total return, meaning dividends plus capital appreciation, of 1,021%, considerably beating both the S&P 500 index and the return offered by companies in its peer group. Image source: Colgate-Palmolive. Positioned for dividend growth High-quality companies in the consumer staples sector typically generate big and consistent cash flows, so they tend to pay generous dividends. In fact, dividends are one of the main reasons why many investors gravitate toward market leaders in different consumer staples categories.  Colgate-Palmolive pays a dividend yield of 2.3% at current prices, which is not particularly high by industry standards. For example, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is paying almost 3% in dividends, while Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) offers a dividend yield of 2.9%. On the other hand, the company has a pristine track record of dividend payments over the long term. Colgate-Palmolive has paid uninterrupted dividends for 122 years in a row, and it has increased dividends in every year over the last 54 consecutive years. Even better, Colgate-Palmolive has outperformed both Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark in terms of dividend growth over the last decade. CL Dividend data by YCharts. Wall Street analysts are on average expecting Colgate-Palmolive to make $2.87 in earnings per share during 2016. This puts the dividend payout ratio at nearly 54% versus earnings forecasts for the current year, which is quite a sustainable ratio. As a reference, Procter & Gamble has a dividend payout ratio of 68% of earnings, while Kimberly-Clark offers a dividend payout ratio around 61% versus earnings expectations for 2016. While Colgate-Palmolive is not the highest-yielding dividend stock in the consumer staples sector, the company doesn't leave much to be desired in terms of dividend growth. Financial performance has been remarkably solid over the long term, and the dividend payout ratio is still comfortably safe. This means that Colgate-Palmolive is in a strong position to continue rewarding investors with consistent dividend growth over the years ahead.  Andrés Cardenal has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Published on October 07, 2016. Reprints Reprints Most Popular Organizations are spending countless hours and dollars to transform into digitally-deep, Snapchat-savvy marketers. In lieu of a better plan, many have relied on hiring digital natives -- or at least the "digitally immersed" among us -- to teach everyone else how this new-fangled stuff actually works. These employees spend their days servicing client needs, and their nights creating training programs intended to help their colleagues grasp the difference between DSPs, SSPs, DMPs and a host of other acronyms. (Ad Age just published some useful definitions here, actually.) The last decade has been dominated by remedial classes for traditionally trained advertising practitioners who grew up before the digital era. The problem is, there hasn't been adequate attention paid to the reverse. While agencies focused on educating offline experts about digital, they overlooked the fact that many digital natives have a limited knowledge of marketing overall. Many digital companies are a refreshing mix of former science students, Bachelor of Arts majors and business graduates. What they typically lack are employees with marketing degrees. This was less problematic when digital tactics consumed one's day, but as these people rise in the ranks and begin managing cross-disciplinary teams or seek roles as strategists or researchers, their lack of marketing savvy becomes apparent all too quickly. True, they may have completed countless channel-specific courses run by Google and Facebook, but because their careers to date have focused on the executional end of campaigns and budgets handed down after investment justifications have already been made, there has been little need for them to acquire a wider view. Even those in client-facing roles have traditionally needed one simple argument to drive success: The internet is big, people use the internet, your competitors use the internet to advertise, and you should too. That theory -- slapped across a few PowerPoint slides and backed up with appropriate statistics -- has driven growth in digital platforms, from desktop to mobile to search, and is still being used for new innovations like virtual reality. But digital isn't simply "digital" any more; it's just the way we live, love and conduct business. In the marketing arena, new technologies such as programmatic have also compressed the distance between executional and strategic. In 2016, every employee, whatever his or her job title, needs to add an understanding of the core marketing principles to their channel skills. You need a plan Agencies need to stop focusing on digital "up-skilling" and start thinking about connected training that covers all media channels and marketing principles -- for all their staff. Google has recognized this need by expanding its Squared Online digital marketing course to include modules such as "A Connected World" and "Think Like A Brand." The Institute of Direct and Digital Marketing also goes far beyond tactics with its Professional Diploma in Digital Marketing. AOL's Grow program is another inspiring initiative. It covers topics from the art of the pitch to leadership to agency-client relationships, and is backed up by experienced mentorship from ad industry legends like leadership veteran David Bell and ex-P&G CMO Jim Stengel. Although not specifically aimed at digital experts, its targeted audience of mid-senior agency management ensures that it's providing wider learnings to many rising stars who grew up in these channels. At MediaCom, we are building a global marketing curriculum that ensures that all our staff, whatever their level, have a broad understanding of marketing principles, along with those that may specifically apply to their individual disciplines. An essential part of the process for our industry is to encourage people to own up to the fact that, despite years of digital success, they may have no formal marketing training, and vice versa. The truth is that we all recognize we can't know it all. But an organization has to make it safe and comfortable for a high-flyer to admit that she or he has not been adequately trained in non-endemic skills. We can still celebrate their executional expertise. The ability to execute auction-based media, A/B testing, optimize creative formats at scale, as well as understand technology stacks and harness them for personalized marketing are all critical for our business. But we can also make it a positive when people add a new, broader perspective to this knowledge -- assets that will help them grow, develop and, ultimately, take on larger responsibilities. Our industry has come a long way when it comes to digital, and has rightly focused on training traditional marketers to confidently toss a "SERP," "interstitial," or "container tag" into their day-to-day conversations. Now we need our digital employees to have the best possible understanding of key concepts and principles too.

Reuters Published Monday, Oct. 03, 2016 4:20PM EDT Last updated Monday, Oct. 03, 2016 5:18PM EDT Comments AA Canada’s main stock index fell on Monday, as major gold miners lost ground and heavyweight banks also pulled back as the federal government tightened mortgage and tax rules in a bid to cool the housing market. The most influential stocks weighing on the index included Goldcorp Inc which fell 4.5 per cent to C$20.68 after it temporarily shut down its Peñasquito gold mine in Mexico due to a week-long blockade by a trucking contractor. Barrick Gold Corp, which is dealing with its own forced shutdown of operations at a mine in Argentina, lost 1.9 per cent to C$22.78. The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 1.8 per cent. “Apart from the trials and tribulations of the giant gold companies which are mostly Canadian, the mining companies are experiencing a growing arrival of free cash flows,” said Michael Smedley, chief portfolio manager at Morgan Meighen & Associates. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index closed down 36.82 points, or 0.25 per cent, at 14,689.04. Seven of the index’s 10 main groups ended in negative territory. The financials group slipped 0.2 per cent, as Ottawa said it will close a tax loophole and introduce a stress test to insured mortgage lending. Investors were also more cautious as Britain set a March deadline to start its withdrawal from the European Union and worries over Deutsche Bank continued to swirl. Royal Bank of Canada fell 0.4 per cent to C$80.95 and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce lost 0.7 per cent to C$101.01. Shares in fashion retailer Aritzia Inc settled at C$17.71 in their market debut, after they were priced at C$16 last week. The energy sector gained 0.6 per cent as Brent settled above $50 a barrel for the first time since August and U.S. crude hit three-month highs, after Iran exhorted the need for other oil producers to join OPEC in supporting the market. Shares in Spectral Medical Inc slumped 85 per cent to 24 Canadian cents after it said its experimental treatment for sepsis – a common, often deadly complication of infection – failed a late-stage study, stymieing the company’s plans to bring to market the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved device for the condition. Wall St dips in slow start to fourth quarter The fourth quarter got off to a weak start for U.S. stock investors on Monday, with financials, consumer staples and utilities pulling the S&P 500 lower. Major indexes have bounced between gains and losses in the past few days, with investors nervous about the outcome of a tight race for the White House ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Big banks extended recent declines as investors worried about the stability of Deutsche Bank and also Wells Fargo & Co’s handling of sales abuses. U.S-listed shares of Deutsche slipped 0.85 per cent as hopes faded of a swift deal with U.S. authorities over a multi-billion dollar penalty for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. “The feeling is there will be a negotiation lowering that penalty but it’s certainly a bit of an overhang on the overall market,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. The S&P 500 financial index declined 0.43 per cent as Wells Fargo slid 1.02 per cent to its lowest since December 2013. Also weighing on investor sentiment was a plan announced by Britain on Sunday to start its separation from the European Union by March. With yields on U.S. Treasury bonds up following stronger-than-expected U.S. manufacturing data for September, the interest-rate sensitive utility sector fell 1.35 per cent. The consumer staples index declined 0.6 per cent, with Procter & Gamble falling 1.21 per cent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3 per cent to end the session at 18,253.85 points and the S&P 500 lost 0.33 per cent to 2,161.2. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.21 per cent to 5,300.87 points. About 5.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, well below the 7.1 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. S&P 500 companies on average are expected to posts a 0.5 per cent dip in third-quarter earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data. That would mark a fifth straight quarter of year-over-year earnings declines, in large part due to weak oil prices. Tesla Motors jumped 4.74 per cent after the electric carmaker said third-quarter deliveries rose by 70 per cent to 24,500 cars. Cabela’s surged 15.02 per cent after the retailer said it would be acquired by Bass Pro Shops in a deal valued at about $5.5-billion. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.40-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 77 new highs and 32 new lows.

article PALO ALTO, California, October 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The new survey has been carried out by One Hour Translation, the world's largest online translation agency, together with Google Consumer

The survey was performed together with Google Consumer Survey among 1,000 participants across the U.S. When asked which language the next U.S. president should speak, Spanish topped the list with 27% of the respondents; Chinese was a distant second with 6.5%, followed by Russian (4.3%), French (3.8%), Arabic (3.7%) and German (2.7%). When broken down by age, One Hour Translation revealed that 67% of the youngest voters (ages 18-24) believed the president should be able to speak a second language, while 41% of the respondents in this age bracket thought the president should speak Spanish.  The survey also found a divergence of opinion in different states.

The group of government, business and academic leaders visited USAP facilities as part of a process to develop a long-term vision to support research in the future. Blue Ribbon Panel Group think tank visits Antarctica to recommend long-term vision for USAP By Peter Rejcek, Antarctic Sun Editor Posted December 30, 2011 Norman Augustine has an idea about how the United States can retain its leadership in an era of increasing global economic competitiveness and budgetary turmoil. It’s a one-two punch philosophy advocated by many in the current administration, including President Barack Obama . “One is to fix our education system and two is greater investment in research,” said Augustine, former chairman and CEO of Lockheed Martin Corp. who has held a slew of government posts over his career, many with a bent toward research and technological development, including chairman of the National Academy of Engineering . It’s that passion for science and technology that has drawn him once again to Antarctica, where he and other government, business and academic leaders spent the first week of December visiting the research facilities and field camps maintained by the National Science Foundation (NSF) , which manages the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) . Augustine gave an interview to The Antarctic Sun during the recent visit to U.S. Antarctic facilities. In 2010, the NSF initiated a comprehensive review of the nation’s research operations on the southernmost continent in collaboration with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) . OSTP advises the White House, while the OMB is the part of the executive branch that implements presidential policy. Photo Credit: Peter Rejcek Members of the Blue Ribbon Panel and NSF officials talk with McMurdo Supply Operations manager Mel Moore, right, about warehousing issues at McMurdo Station. The process started when a committee under the National Research Council was tasked with examining future Antarctic research priorities, which led to a report called Future Science Opportunities in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean . The NRC is part of the National Academies , along with the National Academy of Sciences , National Academy of Engineering and Institute of Medicine . Together the Academies help shape national policies in their respective fields. The NRC committee identified long-term research goals that should guide the USAP in the coming decades, calling for a balance between understanding Antarctica’s role in global climate processes and ensuring an emphasis on discovery and basic research. [See previous article Eye on the future: NRC panel recommends implementing Antarctic observation network.) Now it’s the job of the USAP Blue Ribbon Panel , chaired by Augustine, to wed the future demands of science with a robust and flexible logistics infrastructure. Augustine led a similar review of the USAP in the mid-1990s that helped pave the way for a new $150-million research station at the bottom of the world. “We realize that predicting science is a hazardous business … It often proves to be wrong. The facilities here will long outlast the next generation of science,” noted Augustine while at McMurdo Station where he and a half-dozen members of the panel had spent the previous day visiting buildings, workshops and warehouses. Construction of McMurdo Station began in 1955 during a “golden age” of scientific discovery known as the International Geophysical Year . McMurdo was not originally intended to be a major scientific base in its own right, but to serve as an airfield for planes that would fly to the South Pole to establish a research station there the following year. More than 50 years and dozens of structures later, McMurdo has grown into the largest research station in Antarctica, home to more than 1,100 people during the sun-filled summer months of October through February. At least one building in McMurdo dates back to the late 1950s. Most of the research projects funded by the NSF and other federal science agencies flow through McMurdo, which is the gateway to field camps across the continent and still the launching pad to its more modernized, sister station at the South Pole. Augustine and the rest of the panel had an opportunity to visit the South Pole Station for a day trip. He said it was satisfying to see what had only been a concept 15 years ago turn into reality. “It’s such an improvement over the old station. … What a step forward,” said Augustine, making his fourth trip to the Ice.

But Augustine noted that the panel’s job is to take a holistic approach in analyzing the different pieces of the USAP, which costs about $265 million a year to operate, not including direct research dollars, which accounted for about $70 million in fiscal year 2011. The USAP comprises McMurdo and South Pole, and a third research facility, Palmer Station off the Antarctic Peninsula, focuses on marine and biological research. The Program also operates two research vessels and engages the U.S. military to provide logistical support in the air and on the sea, as well as private companies to operate helicopters and aircraft specifically designed to fly in the polar environment. “They all impact each other; maybe there’s a saving here that will produce a big benefit somewhere else. I think it’s the big picture where there may be a lot of leverage,” Augustine said. The panel got an opportunity to learn about the bits and pieces not just from touring facilities, field camps and airfields, but also directly from the support personnel and science community at McMurdo during an open meeting. A few themes emerged from the comments made by USAP participants : consolidation of warehouses, a centralized recreation center, and an emphasis on alternative energy. “We have an incredible opportunity to do something very different in the way we generate power at this facility,” noted Blue Ribbon Panel member Keith Harrison, a former executive for more than 40 years at Procter & Gamble , a Cincinnati-based, Fortune 500 company, during the meeting. “We’re united in believing that this could be — and should be — a place that could lead the way and be a demonstration site for a totally different way of thinking about power generation,” he added.

Augustine repeatedly lauded the workforce charged with managing the warehouses, driving the machinery, cooking the meals, and doing all the other tasks required to run what is basically a small town. “We’ve been impressed with their competence and their ‘can-do’ attitude, particularly with their friendliness and hospitality,” Augustine said. “Everyone we’ve run into has been so helpful.” The panel expects to make its report to the White House and NSF in 2012 after further visits at stateside USAP facilities and Palmer Station. Augustine conceded that the austere budget climate hanging over Washington makes it challenging to expect another project as ambitious as the South Pole Station to emerge in its recommendations. However, he said even difficult economic times don’t necessarily require cuts across the board. An aeronautical engineer, Augustine likened the current economic climate to developing a new airplane that at first is too heavy to fly. Engineers may be forced to redesign or eliminate certain features, but there’s one thing they’ll never cut: “Never did we solve the problem by taking an engine off,” Augustine said. “That’s the message here. … There are ways to reduce weight … but you don’t take the engine off. This place is one of the engines.” Accompanying the panel were Karl Erb, director of the NSF’s Office of Polar Programs ; Brian Stone, director of OPP’s Antarctic Infrastructure and Logistics Division ; and Jerry Miller, assistant director, Ocean Sciences, in OSTP’s  Environment & Energy Division.

In a filing Thursday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Armstrong Flooring said COO David Schulz's position with the company will be eliminated, effective Oct. 15. "The Chief Operating Officer role had responsibility for providing transition guidance during our first year as a publicly traded company and would be reevaluated at the end of that one year," Alison van Harskamp, a company spokeswoman, said in a statement. "We've been able to achieve certain transition milestones more quickly than anticipated and determined it was prudent to eliminate the position at this time." The company's severance agreement with Schulz, according to separate SEC filings, said he will receive $1.26 million in a cash payment. Armstrong Flooring also will pay him a pro-rated annual incentive bonus to be paid at a later date, the new filing shows. Schulz was senior vice president and CFO at Armstrong World prior to the April 1 spinoff. He started with the company in 2011 after leaving Procter & Gamble.  Armstrong Flooring has about 3,500 employees worldwide and 17 manufacturing facilities in three countries. Shares of the company's stock are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol AFI.  More From This Industry • 'Fixer Upper' star visits York Wallcoverings to discuss product lines • How will Trump's trade, tariff policies affect manufacturing? • What should be the first priority for President-elect Donald Trump?

There are a number of ways where what we’re doing today is setting the stage for that soon-to-be-future. Most of the foundational elements of advertising today are setting the stage for a digital, addressable, television landscape. At the core are data and cross-device methodologies.   Much of the online landscape is still, rather surprisingly, based on third-party and first-party cookies. Mobile has some capacity for cookies, but is mostly based on device IDs. The TV landscape will be dependent on device IDs since cookies don’t work on set-top boxes, cable boxes, or TVs themselves. The methods for cross-device are applicable in this environment and will be a necessity for identifying and recognising customers and what stage of the journey they may be in when they’re exposed to an ad in that environment. Identifying and recognising the customer and delivering a personalised message across online, mobile, TV and even digital OOH and in-store will create a truly addressable, customisable media experience. Ad serving is also going to be challenged and refined in an addressable TV world. The commercial format is still the basis for advertising on a TV, and local boxes will need to be the launching point for addressable commercials. The local box or platform will need to identify, recognise and determine which commercial to serve up rather than calling from a remote location and serving it up over the Web. I foresee a technology where IDs are anticipated and commercials are served in the background, to be cached locally and called up at viewing. That means the local box can have a slew of commercials at the ready, and they can be delivered faster. Being able to view the entire digital media landscape in one interconnected campaign is going to be powerful for marketers. Identifying and recognising the customer and delivering a personalised message across online, mobile, TV and even digital OOH and in-store will create a truly addressable, customisable media experience. This makes attribution and measurement more accurate and provides marketers with the tools to optimise campaigns in a more efficient manner.   When this happens, the question remains: What happens to the upfront? I think the model of upfront buying will still be important, but at a corporate portfolio level where larger conglomerates are able to purchase media in advance and optimise allocations based on the portfolio of products they represent. From Viacom and Time Warner to Clorox and P&G, this creates a new way to manage media that drives efficiency even further than in the past. When one product is not making good use of the media, another can be slotted in to take its place and maximise the upfront allocation. I for one am truly excited about the combined digital landscape, which I predict will be the case in just four short years.  Today the numbers I’ve seen are that between 15 million to 17 million U.S. households will be digital-TV-enabled by the end of 2016. I assume progress to speed up over the next three years, delivering the kind of experience I, as a marketer, am truly looking forward to. Are you?

The National Memo Smart. Sharp. Funny. Fearless. Monday, November 14, 2016 Submit Tips & Stories Campaign 2016 Politics National World Opinion Money Lifestyle Books Entertainment Health Travel Video   Joe Conason Goodbye, CGI: A Moral Victory For Bill Clinton — And Many Others September 23, 2016 9:24 pm / 83 Comments / Campaign 2016, Editor's Blog, Featured Post, Middle East, Politics, Weekend Reader, White House Tags Bill Clinton Clinton Foundation Clinton Global Initiative Hillary Clinton Joe Conason Judicial Watch Palantir Procter & Gamble Republish Reprint Late on the afternoon of September 21 — almost exactly eleven years after Bill Clinton inaugurated the annual Clinton Global Initiative conferences in New York City — the former president offered closing remarks there for the very last time. Having watched this innovative organization grow from a casual idea into a formidable entity credited for delivering quality health care, clean water, modern education, disaster relief, and other essential benefits to millions of people around the world, he told its members and supporters gathered in a midtown hotel ballroom that “CGI has worked out better than I ever dreamed.” It was understandable and probably wise for Clinton to declare victory this year, after profoundly changing the mindset and practice of modern philanthropy. But even as John Lennon’s “Imagine” filled the room, it was impossible to ignore another aspect of CGI’s conclusion — the angry, exaggerated, and almost entirely inaccurate attacks on CGI from political adversaries of Bill and Hillary Clinton, bristling with accusations of “corruption” and favoritism.” Such shrill assaults were never heard until Hillary Clinton became the favored candidate to succeed Barack Obama in the White House. Over the years since CGI began, in fact, its membership and operations were resolutely non-partisan, with the participation of many Republicans and independents who shared the desire to do some good in the world. Republican businessmen like John Chambers of Cisco Systems joined CGI, provided financial support, and undertook the “commitments to action” that were at the heart of its mission. Republican politicians like John McCain, Mitt Romney, and even Carly Fiorina came to the annual conference and offered high praise for its work. But that was then — and now, with Hillary Clinton as the historic nominee of the Democratic Party, what Republicans once lauded as a font of good works is denounced as a sewer of venality. While scarcely a word of the criticism is true, that doesn’t matter as much as the opportunity to smear the Clintons for political advantage. The most illuminating example was a widely-publicized press release that falsely depicted a 2005 CGI “commitment” by Bahrain’s crown prince as a bribe to sway the Secretary of State in 2010. Like so many other slanders surrounding the Clintons’ philanthropy, that “exposé” from the right-wing claque called Judicial Watch was a clumsy fraud, yet damaged reputations anyway. Both Bill and Hillary Clinton are accustomed to such attacks after a quarter-century under the national spotlight. He has occasionally observed that “politics ain’t beanbag.” But the vicious attacks on the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative don’t only injure those two battle-hardened politicians. The collateral damage includes many decent, hardworking people who have toiled for years on foundation and CGI projects, including thousands of volunteers, whose pride in helping humanity has been turned to ashes by this sustained propaganda campaign. Pouring abuse on people who do hard work to save lives is vile — and as James Carville said recently, “Somebody is going to hell for this.” If there is a just God, Carville is surely right. While the liars and slanderers contemplate eternal damnation, the rest of the American people — and indeed, people around the world — ought to learn something about what the Clinton Foundation and in particular the Clinton Global Initiative have actually achieved during the past decade or so. Much of the story is told, from the beginning, in my new book Man of the World: The Further Endeavors of Bill Clinton, in which I try to apportion credit to at least a few of the many people who have worked with him over the years. Two years ago, on CGI’s tenth anniversary, the data-processing giant Palantir released a study of its commitments that reached some startling conclusions — and that report is very much worth reading on the foundation website. That website provides detailed information on many of the individual commitments undertaken by the nonprofits, corporations, trade unions, and universities that have joined with CGI — such as Procter & Gamble’s massive project that has delivered billions of gallons of potable water to families in the developing world. Not everything tried by CGI members has succeeded, as Clinton and his staff are quick to acknowledge. But as he said at the end, at least they got caught trying to improve the world. They deserve to be thanked and congratulated rather than shamed. That is much more than anyone can say for their mean-spirited and mendacious critics. For those with shorter attention spans, this brief video that preceded Clinton’s final CGI address is uplifting and instructive, if frankly promotional  — and showcases a few of the individuals who nobly assisted in that organization’s work.     IMAGE: Former U.S. President Bill Clinton speaks during the Clinton Global Initiative’s annual meeting in New York, September 29, 2015.  REUTERS/Lucas Jackson  Click here for reuse options!

That’s why the hate what Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter have done since they left office. marriea No kidding. A ‘I don’t want to do it and I don’t want you to do it neither’, mentality. JPHALL Daddy Bush is the exception. He has spent the last 20 plus years doing good works with both es-presidents Carter and Clinton. dtgraham Look I’m sorry, but there is a far different story about the Clinton Foundation than the one that the Clinton massage therapist, Joe Conason, wants everyone to believe. The Clinton Foundation’s finances have been so messy that the United States’s most influential charity watchdog (Charity Navigator) put it on its watch list of problematic nonprofits. The Clinton family’s mega-charity took in more than $140 million in grants and pledges in 2013, but spent just $9 million on direct aid. The group spent the bulk of its windfall on administration, travel, and salaries and bonuses, with the fattest payouts going to family friends. That’s far below the 75 percent rate of spending that nonprofit experts say a good charity should spend on its mission. Charity Navigator put the foundation on its watch list, which warns potential donors about investing in problematic charities. “It seems like the Clinton Foundation operates as a slush fund for the Clintons,” said Bill Allison, a senior fellow at the Sunlight Foundation, a government watchdog group where progressive Democrat and Fordham Law professor Zephyr Teachout is an organizing director. Don’t get me wrong. The Trump Foundation is even worse, and the con-man Donald Trump should get nowhere near the White House, but do you want the truth or not? http://amac.us/charity-watchdog-clinton-foundation-called-a-slush-fund/ Dominick Vila https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=16680 dtgraham Read this. There is one hell of lot more here than Joe Conason is saying. I took note of Lawrence O’Donnell in the article particularly. https://www.currentaffairs.org/2016/08/the-clinton-foundations-problems-are-deeper-than Dominick Vila https://www.clintonfoundation.org/our-work/clinton-foundation-haiti Dominick Vila https://www.clintonfoundation.org/our-work/by-region/africa Dominick Vila https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_Foundation stcroixcarp Having worked on some non-profit boards and foundations, I can tell you that there is a difference between grants and pledges and actual cash you have to spend. Some grants are doled out over several years and pledges are often paid out in installments. 140 million in pledges and grants may only be 14 million or less in yearly income over 10 years. dtgraham Maybe so but the Better Business Bureau said that the Clinton Foundation fails on two of its accountability measures for charities: It hasn’t done an effectiveness assessment of its programs and doesn’t have a written policy to do so in the future. Supporters argue that it’s a solid charity because 79% of its expenses (88% on Wikipedia) go to program services. What they don’t say is that most of this money pays for salaries, travel expenses and meetings. In 2014, for example, the Clinton Foundation spent $12.3 million holding conferences, conventions and meetings and $6 million on travel. More than $25 million went to employees of the foundation in wages and benefits. These three categories alone make up 59% of the program-services expenses. In contrast, the foundation spent just over $5 million on grants and aid in 2014. Joan Sources are important. dtgraham I stayed off the right wingnut websites and stuck to the legitimate media. I could have posted several more links. You can read about how problematic the Clinton Foundation is all day. http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/22/a-big-slush-fund-for-the-clinton-foundation/ http://nypost.com/2015/04/26/charity-watchdog-clinton-foundation-a-slush-fund/ https://www.currentaffairs.org/2016/08/the-clinton-foundations-problems-are-deeper-than jmprint That same article says: Charity Navigator, which rates nonprofits, recently refused to rate the Clinton Foundation because its “atypical business model . . . doesn’t meet our criteria.” But yet, you can log on to Charity Navigator and it shows good rating on the Clinton Foundation. “The Clinton Foundation is a International charity rated 4 of 4 stars by Charity Navigator. Located in New York, NY, it is one of 8360 organizations rated by Charity … dtgraham The Sunlight Foundation, whose stated goal is make government and politics more accountable and transparent, still thinks that the Clinton Foundation is a slush fund for the Clintons. the actual Bajmahal First, per the Washington Post: “According to its Web site, Charity Navigator puts charities on the [watch] list whenever a third party identifies issues that potential donors might find interesting. It said it does not assess the merits of those accounts. In the case of the Clinton Foundation, it cited recent media accounts about foreign government donations.” which is essentially what Charity Navigator posted when they put the CF on their Watch List. The book, Clinton Cash had come out and the NYT excerpted it in a series of articles and because the NYT was paying attention, others in the media followed suit. So there were a flurry of headlines, negative headlines. And per the algorithms of Charity Navigator, that was enough to put CF on their Watch List. It was neither a judgement nor a confirmation of wrong-doing. Also no, just no. http://www.factcheck.org/2015/06/where-does-clinton-foundation-money-go/ And because they have now changed their data fields to include all the types of work that the CF does, Charity Navigator currently gives the CF their top rating, a four star (out of four star) rating. Another reputable watchdog group, Charity Watch, gives and has regularly given the CF an A rating. For perspective, Charity Watch gives the Red Cross a B+. Yet another reputable watchdog group, GuideStar, gives and has regularly given the CF a Platinum rating, which is their highest rating. The book, Clinton Cash was nothing more than an election year mud ball. Most, it not all, of its insinuations have been disproven. But as a smear, it was somewhat successful — just like the endless Benghazi/email investigations. This has always been the point. “Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right?” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Ca) told Sean Hannity. “But we put together a Benghazi Special Committee… a Select Committee… What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping.” http://thedailybanter.com/2015/09/quote-of-the-day-republican-admits-benghazi-scandal-was-orchestrated-to-take-down-hillary/ dtgraham After Charity Navigator listed the Clinton Foundation as problematic, they then received favors from the Clinton Global Initiative including a free membership that entitled their officials to rub elbows with world leaders. At that point, suddenly their algorithm changed and they then issued their top rating for the Clinton Foundation. That four-star rating had hardly been announced before the Associated Press reported that Charity Navigator was a member of the CGI from 2012 to 2014. The CGI is one of the Clinton Foundation’s best-known programs, as it regularly convenes glittering gatherings of celebrities, government officials and philanthropic stars. The $20,000 CGI membership fee was waived for Charity Navigator, which reported it as an in-kind contribution, according to the AP. The news organization said Charity Navigator chairman Michael Thatcher claimed his group joined CGI “to mingle with world leaders and promote its ratings.” Think that had anything to do with it? iamproteus I’m sure it means something to someone who is desperately looking for something to hang the Clintons for. But as for credible evidence of wrong-doing it doesn’t mean SQUAT! In fact, it is more credible to believe that the “free membership” achieved its purpose by allowing C.N. to get a better (more close up) view of the operation of CGI, thereby permitting a fairer assessment than one based on numbers alone. After two years of closer scrutiny, it was determined that the prior assessment was unfair and therefore amended. Think that could be as plausible as your negative interpretation? dtgraham The prior assessment wasn’t unfair. The Clinton Foundation had such a weird business model for a charitable foundation that they could no longer evaluate them. There were also financial transparency concerns until more tax filings were released. dtgraham I have no interest in hanging the Clintons. They do a good job of hanging themselves needlessly too often. jmprint Too many of the accusations that are out there are lies, conspiracies and distorts. Unless something can be substantiated with actual facts it should be repeated or spread as truth. dtgraham Too many are; agreed. When you’re looking for information, the moment you enter the conservative media it’s just a fever swamp of misinformation, distortions, and outright lies. You have to be careful. Still, the Clintons also don’t help themselves. I have my differences and criticisms of Hillary Clinton, but it’s just pure politics and they’re in relative moderation. To the right though, she’s the evil Satanic lizard god and lord of the underworld. the actual Bajmahal Nope, not really. Mainly because Charity Navigator isn’t currently a member of CGI, but was a member of CGI from 2012 through 2014. This, in case you don’t have a calendar handy, is 2016. Also, while Charity Navigator was a member of CGI, Charity Navigator downgraded the CF from four stars to three stars — this was in 2012. Also, Charity Navigator stopped rating CF entirely in 2014 (because of how the CF was structured no longer fit CN’s rating algorithms). That situation has now changed because those involved took the necessary accounting steps. If the Clintons were actually bribing Charity Navigator, then I must say, that is one subtle “long con” bribe. dtgraham Waiving the fee thing was the only information that I got from a conservative website that looked like it had some legitimacy. Typical. As soon as you’re in the conservative media, the misinformation starts. That looked damning, but it would have been helpful to know that fees are waived for similar organizations too. The problem with these evaluators is that they’re asking only the minimal, base, type questions. The Foundation is not spending nearly as much money on actual charity as they claim, and their Wikipedia page says. The Foundation has spent increasing portions of its budget on salaries over the years, and decreasing portions on the distribution of low-cost pharmaceuticals for example. They may be spending x on program services to satisfy the charity evaluator, but they’re not saying how much of that is eaten up in salaries, travel, etc… They’re not asking what the Foundation’s programming actually does and what has the organization gotten for it’s money? Exactly what has it accomplished? There is a tremendous lack of transparency there, and the Foundation has been silent on this whenever asked. They’re also not asking how arm’s length their donors are, and do they have favoured access? We now know through Wikileaks that it was hard to know where the state department and the Clinton Foundation both started and ended. They were mixed from 2009-2013. Want one example? There were 148 phone messages from a Foundation senior executive to Hillary’s top aide from 2010-2012. That was more than any other caller. Their practices are open to question too. It seems a little odd that your charitable stated mission is to help corporations profit from the developing world. An example: working with credit card companies to expand the volume of low-cost loans offered to poor inner city residents. Typically, enticing poor people into taking on large amounts of credit card debt is not among the activities of a charitable foundation. They also receive a lot of money from human rights violators around the world. Who believes that Saudi Arabia donated so much to the Foundation because the Saudis felt a real commitment to one of the Foundation’s stated goals of empowering women and improving LGBT rights? They wanted favours and access. As to favours and access, the trend in donations to the foundation also raise suspicions, since they appear to rise and fall along with Hillary Clinton’s status. Tax filings show that donations dropped sharply in 2012 — Clinton’s last year at the State Dept — totaling less than $50 million. In contrast, the Foundation got more than $126 million in her first year at State. And as the 2016 election has drawn closer, donations once again ramped up, topping $172 million in 2014 — the last year for which data are available. The foundation also raked in nearly $4 million in speech revenue in 2014. It made less than half that in 2012. It’s not reasonable to think that all of these things are mere coincidences. She may enter the White House owing favours to dictators. At any rate, while the Foundation does some good in the world, there are still serious legitimate questions to be asked about the CGI and the Foundation (more the Foundation) nevertheless, and this website will not ask any of them. Certainly not Joe Conason. Yet he and his writers felt the need to tear Bernie Sanders apart all during the primaries, day after day. Hypocrisy, thy name is Conason. EvenstarMtl Donald Trump was the sole financial contributor to the Trump Foundation for 20 years….it was ALL his own money! Wake up! jmprint That’s a lie, wikipedia proves your statement incorrect. dtgraham He used other people’s money to fake philanthropy. He hasn’t put in a dime since 2008. PrecipitousDrop The Charity Navigator’s poor report was retracted FIVE DAYS after it was originally posted. This watchdog’s highest rating for the Clinton Foundation was restored, and has remained unchanged to this day. Charity Navigator used incorrect financial models to reach the erroneously downgraded assessment. The New York Times and Washington Post reported the correction, the retraction, and the explanations for it, but the links to these old articles are just as dead as your link to Charity Navigator. It’s old news. It has been corrected. Period. Dominick Vila On a positive note, the sickening attacks against the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative exposed the callousness and lack of morality of the Republican party to every person capable of rational thinking, in and outside the United States. Going after charitable institutions respected for their deeds worldwide, exposes not only the partisanship and the willingness to go to extremes seldom attempted by responsible political parties, but the lack of humanity and morality of the detractors of these institutions. As opposed to the private Trump Foundation, the revenues and outlays of the CGI and Clinton Foundation are available for public scrutiny. As opposed to frequent audits and fines against evidence of bribe and fraud by the Trump Foundation, the Clinton charities enjoy the respect of the entire world, and are being attacked because a foreign leader committed a substantial amount of money to improve education in his country, at the behest of the CGI, and had dinner with Hillary in 2005…four years before she became SoS! How do they explain donating $25,000 to Pam Bondi, the Florida Attorney General, who dropped her plans to investigate Trump U four days after getting the loot, and how do they react to the IRS fining Trump $2,500 for not reporting that “donation” in their tax return? It was all a clerical error, no biggie. How do they explain Trump using Foundation donations to buy a portrait of himself, to pay debt, and to cover personal expenses? Silence! Sadly, as it happens so often, the ones that will lose the most as a result of the vicious attacks against the Clinton Foundation and the CGI, are those who have benefited from their altruism. AgLander Smarmy Fawning Alert!! iamproteus Please explain the meaning of that phrase, Ag. Every word of Dom’s post is true and accurate, so I don’t think you could have meant anything negative by it. I’d just like to know exactly what it means so I can use it properly. Thanks! Kevin Johnson A thoughtful and eloquent post as always DV. But here is one issue that we all need to face; the right do not want to see facts. There is no proof that will dissuade them from their ideological, hyper-partisan fantasy. I would invite all to watch footage of the crowds at Hitler’s speeches. Notice the vacant looks of mindless rapture as they cheer. That is (I believe) what we are up against now in this country. There will be no convincing. The facts are there and irrefutable for those who will see, but those firmly in the right camp will not see. Therefore it is imperative that EVERYONE who does see the facts VOTES. There can be no sitting on the sidelines, no “I’m only one tiny vote” apathy this election. The consequences are far too great: President Donald Trump. Joan It is not merely the ” right”, the tide has been so relentless that it has eroded even liberals and progressive’s support of HRC, the enthusiasm gap. Many will vote for her, because the alternatives are unthinkable, even while thinking that she really is a crook. I challenged one such person who thinks that her being able to hid her crookedness from the relentless investigations and the army of dirt diggers was just proof of Hillary being a smart crook. She is going to vote for Hillary because she thinks that Hillary will wield that smart crookedness ” for us”, so there is that, I guess. ps0rjl I am amazed at how much slander is put at Hillary’s feet and yet through all the partisan investigations at taxpayers’ expense, there is never so much as a finding of any criminal action. Yet here we have the Donald bilking people out of thousands of dollars to join Trump U. which is a nothing more than a scam, Donald using money from the Trump Foundation to settle personal liabilities, and his slimy business practices that have left thousands of employees and contractors holding the bag for his bankruptcies, and yet hardly a word has been said about his actions. marriea There is a reason Trump targeted mostly whites, (uneducated as he put it) because he knows those people are more apt to blame other for their problems and they, nationwide, represent the majority. idamag The right was very careful and shrewd in trying to label Hillary as crooked. Notice trump always says “crooked Hillary.” marriea As my daughter pointed out, the followers of Donald Trump and his defenders are reflection of the mindset of Americans these days. But alas, it is also a reflection of the ways of mankind in general. Dominick Vila There is, indeed, a rebellion against the status quo, the norms of conduct we have used for decades, social programs, diplomacy Vs war, and very surprisingly for the party of big business, attacks against Wall Street. Seeing the GOP attack capitalism is the last thing I would have expected. In fairness, they are also attacking socialism, and everything related to the past. Sometimes it almost seem as if they are championing anarchy. They just don’t know it yet. marriea of course you’re correct. There is a reason for that old adage about ‘not be able to see the forrest for the trees’. As it relates to Donald Trump, he is suggesting what he can/will do for people, and because they have their heads firmly planted inside his wallet and their desire to ‘be wealthy?’ like him, they believe that he is their salvation to materialism that commericalism has put in front of their faces. They are willing to give him a huge pass in spite of the bundles of evidence showing him to be just as it has been pointed out tho them. On top of that, the other folks are pissed that they can’t seemingly get by just because the super rich have found a way to get what they want out of the system and so they feel cheated. From my perspective, there is a way to change that pattern that is so simple as to be too easy. V-O-T-E!!!! Once the elites in our local, state and national elections find that folks will go and vote in droves, they will adjust their way of doing business. There is a reason why officials keep tabs on voting habits and the precincts involved. They know which area is inclined to vote and which don’t bother. They are in effect saying that if you don’t bother to participate in the game, then you have no say in how the game is played and that if you don’t watch me, I will cheat you. The people have the power to change things, but they won’t use that powerful weapon. (sigh). PrecipitousDrop It’s a red-faced Shame that Democratic voters only visit the polls once every four years. We must learn to vote whenever the polls are opened — just like Republicans do. marriea I won’t argue with that accessment. Sadly, DEMS and GOP voter do also, have an unrealistic view of the workings of politics. Just because someone says that I ‘promise’ to do this or that, doesn’t actually mean”NOW”, but that they will propose to put something into operation. Perhaps School House Rock would help them understand a little bit about how a bill becomes law. Or better yet, just go an pick up a civic books and actually read the thing. Dominick Vila I agree. Unfortunately a lot of people form opinions, and make decisions, based on superficial things, such as glamor, showmanship, and other things that have nothing to do with qualifications, relevant experience, or the temperament and judgment needed to be a good leader. What scares the most about a Trump presidency, in addition to his over reactions and immaturity, is the potential long term impact on the Supreme Court. The effects of a major shift to the far right will be felt for at least a generation. Democrats have to find a way to energize our base to ensure everyone votes. VirtualPapy Word. EvenstarMtl “I would invite all to watch footage of the crowds at Hitler’s speeches. Notice the vacant looks of mindless rapture as they cheer.” Ya, I remember that look when Obama ran in 2008 on nothing but “Hope and Change” and a very short list of accomplishments. At least Trump has a track record of many many successes, is a problem solver and a doer and that is what Americans acknowledging. Remember, Obama had no experience compared to Trump but it seems Americans are not allowed to point this out about Obama…. iamproteus Are you really suggesting that Hillary has no track record of success as FLOTUS, Senator and S.O.S, over the last 20 odd years? And about Trumps’ “many, many successes”. Has Hillary been bankrupt multiple times? Has she been charged, convicted and fined multiple times? Has she dumped two marriages after cheating on both of them? Has she repeatedly stiffed contractors and employees after they completed their end of the bargain? Have you no honor, no credibility? How can you look your children in the eye and tell them that honesty is the best policy? AgLander “Moral victory for Bill Clinton” is a non sequitur because it is an unwritten rule that the word “moral” and “Bill Clinton” should never be used together in the same sentence. It causes to much laughter. marriea And what, pray tell, have you done lately? iamproteus It looks like Ag isn’t going to answer you so I will take it upon myself to answer as he would if a moment of honesty were to overcome him (I know…fat chance!): “What have I done lately? I HAVE LIED! LIED, I TELL YA! LIED! LIED!” idamag How else is he going to keep his membership in the teapublican hate party? Aaron_of_Portsmouth He’s done nothing but act in knee-jerk mode. Aggie has “Clinton-envy” and it gnaws at him daily, like a bad “Jones”. ps0rjl With your comments I am reminded of some lyrics of a song about hypocrisy and morals. It concerns a man telling his mistress that if he sees her on the street don’t be offended if he doesn’t acknowledge her. It goes like this, ” If I should see you one the street some day, pardon me if I turn away. It’s not that I am ashamed about you and me. But I have to consider my morality.” Aaron_of_Portsmouth Everything you write is a non sequitur, Agatha. You are a constant source of laughter—still trying to find your identity. idamag Funny how trump’s many affairs are just poo-pooed. He was sleeping with Marla Maples, while married to Ivana. He was sleeping with Melania, while married to Marla. And the potential first lady’s bare bottom is all over the internet. Clips from her modeling days. One from Hustle Magazine and one is the pose she did for the NRA. That stuff is out there. Trump stiffed those who built his casinos and hotels. And…they call Bill Clinton immoral. Jon Just another sickening example of the right wing attempts to destroy anything that aids the underprivileged and less fortunate. Yet not a sound about Trump Foundation’s blatant misuse of funds which benefited only Trump financially as well as making it appear as if Trump was charitable when he was nothing but a fraud using as he says, OPM, other people’s money. Sick. Sad. EvenstarMtl Donald Trump was the only financial contributor of the Trump Foundation for 20 years…what, is he misusing his own money???? PrecipitousDrop What charitable contributions did Trump Foundation make in those 20 years, EM? How much did he contribute? Please refer to the laws concerning charitable trusts. Once the contribution to the fund is made, those dollars cannot be used for personal gain. jmprint Post the ledger or link, prove your statement, your word is not enough. Jon Trump’s last significant contribution was in 1989. He has pressured businessmen and associates to donate to his foundation. There is no proof that the only money in the Trump Foundation was only that Trump donated to his foundation. At best it was always a mixture of his funds and those of other donors to the Trump Foundation. He hasn’t contributed any money to his Foundation in at least a decade and in many of the years after 1989, he contributed $0.00 while strong arming those who did business with him to donate to the Trump Foundation. At best, prior to 1990, he used some of his money along with some of the money of donors. Even if your lie was true, it is illegal to use Trump Foundation funds to bribe attorneys general and pay business expenses. You are simply lying. marriea WHAT??!! Trump has been using other people’s money from the begainning. Thoughtopsy Erm… try facts. Your point? Not one. tbs Sickening article as it is a sham! They are NOT welcomed in Haiti and some parts of Africa. Trump has in no way done anything illegally as the Clintons have done! But you liberals keep twisting things and lying to yourselves as being self-righteous to feel good. Keep living in that fairy tale world of make believe, you live in. Wonder, if Hillary loses, how the foreign money, given to them, will react about the promises she will not be able to fulfill will fall back on her> Hmm be interesting to observe. Girlpower If trump has not done anything wrong then why are there over 1300 lawsuits against him right now? One of rape against a 13 year old girl ! How morale was it when his nephews baby son died because trump stopped providing his brothers family with health care as soon as he took over the family estate when Donald Sr passed. This one fact alone is all anyone needs to judge trumps greed and soulless heart! idamag How do all the contractors feel about the four lawsuits? jmprint Yes it will be interesting so vote for Hillary 2016. iamproteus tbs, are you familiar with the psychiatric term: projection? If not, do look it up. You might get a little different perspective on the right wing (including your own) psychological status. Thoughtopsy You appear to have failed to understand even the most basic facts about the Clinton Foundation, CGI or Trump. Here’s something that may help: http://www.gq.com/story/176-reasons-donald-trump-shouldnt-be-president-olbermann This well written GQ article explains exactly who Trump is. You cannot read it, and it’s many links, facts and evidence, and still say stupid things like “Trump has in no way done anything illegally…” Try it. You’ll like it. I promise. You might also like to post actual facts, links and evidence yourself next time. Otherwise you look like you don’t understand how argument works. idamag I just finished a book about Trump, written by one of his executives, Jack McConnell. Trump is who tablespoon is. Dave Mather This is one of the most bias and inaccurate articles I have ever read! And you call that journalism??????? zorro037 You called biased because this report say the true and those trumpist hate the meaning of that word. Trump and his confederates only believe en reiterated and repeated lies, the same way Goebel did back in the 30s and 40s in the nazi German. But you’re in for great frustration, just allow some time to develop every thing that is coming Trump’s way. You gonna see it. iamproteus I can’t help wondering whether you spent any time verifying the veracity of this article or simply saw it as an affront to your preconceived ideology. idamag The latter. That is who they are. Thoughtopsy If you don’t have either facts or links to facts I’m uninterested in your profoundly uninformed opinion. vdpphd There is one thing you can be sure of: if a story is only found on the blog-o-sphere, it is not true. From space aliens to herbal remedies to conspiracy theories, the false stories do not actually make it into the refereed press where libelers can be sued. The reason the main stream is less colorful is that is has to be more careful with the provable facts. Freedom of the press only guarantees the right to publish, and only to the publisher. Malicious publication can be punished, at least civilly Not so on the Internet, where, as the cartoon in the operations room went, “nobody knows that you are a dog.” You cannot trsut television to give you the whole truth and nothing but the truth either. The camera has only one eye so the visuals are misleading. Each story is allocated only so many minutes, not enough time for explanations. No significant issue can be properly explained in less that an academic 50 minute hour – with one third of that time devoted to questions about what is said during the rest of the time. Journalists are taught to ask questions. In fact, journalism today is entirely about questions and is hardly at all about answers. Many of the interlocutors are insufficiently educated to recognize and respond to dishonest answers. Read the list, let the talking head deliver his talking points, say thank you. That is not interviewing – the idea is to get past the scripted message to the underlying realities of the candidate. There is however, actually no end to questions. The public craves the lurid, and that is what television gives – a one eyed view of events and a fascination with the trivial. The problem is that the system of government is designed so that you have to be for something, not just against everything the opposing party proposes. The body politic has real issues that real government must actually deal with, one way or another. We do not control events but we require our government to respond to them as if they did. In the absence of affirmative votes, no taxes are collected, no checks are written, and no government services are provided. The Constitution divides the government into horizontal and vertical pieces, and the result is not a hierarchy. Most issues are in fact local, and are under local jurisdiction, with no Constitutional authority given to the Congress or the President to resolve them. Some issues are federal, solely, and States are denied authority over them. The economy is under control of the Congress, foreign policy and war-fighting mostly under the President, and justice mostly under an independent judiciary. Few federal powers can be exercised without cooperation between Houses of Congress and the President. “no” is not the way ot works. “Let’s make a deal” is the underlying premise. Unfortunately, cooperation does not make for lurid video. You have to demagogue the base to win elections,l but you have to deal with the others afterward when you must govern. The system is set up in such a way that having one party in power in both houses of Congress and the Presidency has only happened six times out of more than 100 federal elections. Demonizing the adversary makes for real lurid coverage. It makes for exciting campaigns. It does not make for effective government. Thoughtopsy It amuses me how the party of Christianity (which is often how they present themselves) can be so callous and cruel to certain groups of people. – It shows in their attitude to Poor people. “Lazy takers”, “Should have worked harder” – It shows in their attitude to Social support Programs. “Cut them… it teaches dependence”. – It shows in their worship of wealth and money. “Tax cuts for the wealthy”,”The Prosperity Gospel”, “Corporate Handouts” – It shows in their demonization and blame for the “Other”… people not like them (i.e. Not White). “Mexicans are Rapists”, “Black on black crime”, “Immigrants are terrorists”, “Immigrants are stealing your jobs”, “Blue lives matter”, “Immigrants commit more crime” My understanding of the New Testament and the Christian religion in general gives me the strong sense that Jesus (were he real and actually watching) would be utterly horrified at the lack of compassion and casual abuse of those most in need. Those points above and the beliefs and attitudes behind them are not Christian. Not even close. That’s why I laugh whenever I see a Republican who holds one or more of those views, and at the same time claims to be a “Christian”. This attack on the Clintons, with CGI as collateral damage, is cruel, callous, calculated, and shows no care for the millions who will die due to the vacuum left by CGI and the resulting lack of help in desperate places around the world. jmprint A good example is Cruz. He pretends to be a christian and is backing Trump, after he himself said Trump was evil. It amazes me how they will stand with an evil man, but won’t stand with Obama an honorable man. Republicans are putting their political party before our great nation and that breaks their ethics and legions. PrecipitousDrop Well, Obama just CAN’T be a good Christian. He’s Black, y’see… idamag If Jesus came to them, and there is a possibility they would deny him right off, and Jesus said, “You cannot have me and your political party. You must choose.” They would choose their party. idamag I have always said of so-called Christians, if they are an example of Christians, I don’t want to be one. idamag Charity Navigator: We had previously evaluated this organization, but have since determined that this charity’s atypical business model can not be accurately captured in our current rating methodology. Our removal of The Clinton Foundation from our site is neither a condemnation nor an endorsement of this charity. We reserve the right to reinstate a rating for The Clinton Foundation as soon as we identify a rating methodology that appropriately captures its business model. What does it mean that this organization isn’t rated? It simply means that the organization doesn’t meet our criteria. A lack of a rating does not indicate a positive or negative assessment by Charity Navigator. idamag % o% Just went to Fact Check. Carly Fiorina said that the Clinton Foundation only spent 6% on charity. Fact: They spend 89 % on charity. They are listed as an operating charity as opposed to one that collects money for grants. Their staff in Africa are training farmers to help them get seeds, equipment and marketing of their crops. Did they accept donations from foreign donors? Yes, and why not. They are helping people worldwide. dpaano It’s unfortunate that the GOP will stoop to the lowest levels of hell to smear the Clintons! And, for those who previously said that the CGI was wonderful and participated in it to now turn their backs on it (yes, you, Carly) is truly the lowest of the low! And, what’s REALLY pitiful is that our media has put forth little or NO information about what the CGI has done and what is being done to them by the GOP!!! If more people were made aware of the good deeds of this group….they might not think so lowly of the Clintons!!! Know First. Smart politics and smart living delivered to your inbox every morning.

QNetNews.ca QNetNews TV 91X FM News The Pioneer QNetNews Interactive QNetNews Trent Twitter Vimeo Facebook Home Campus Community Local Sports Arts Photojournalism Community Hundreds attend Quinte Career Fair October 6, 2016 at 3:10 pm The Quinte Career Fair was held Thursday at the Quinte Sports and Wellness Centre. Photo by Lindsey Harren, QNet News By Lindsey Harren BELLEVILLE – The Quinte Career Fair attracted a lot of resumés and employers at the Quinte Sports and Wellness Centre Thursday. Roughly 50 employers and employer services were accepting resumés and promoting their companies. Shorelines Casino was one of the busiest employer booths, attracting a steady lineup of people. Karen Poste, manager of economic and strategic initiatives for the City of Belleville, said that the career fair has been going on for over 10 years. Poste said that the fairs coincide with when employers are hiring. “We’ve had a great turnout. We have had about 200 people through the door and we’ve been open for just about two hours,” Poste told QNet News Thursday morning. The career fair is funded by sponsorships along with the cities of Belleville and Quinte West. Rob Frick, employment counsellor with Career Edge in Trenton, said his organization has attended every Quinte Career Fair. “We’re actually one of the three who help host it … along with Community Employment Services and Meta Employment Services,” he said. The career fair is a great way to get employers and job seekers connected in the community, Fricke said. “So far it’s been a fantastic response. There is a lot of great employers here. Helps that the casino is here.” Morgan Foran from Meta Employment Services said: “A lot of people are finding jobs right now.” Dusty Timbbs, also of Meta Employment Services, said the jobs created by Shorelines Casino are something they are helping their clients work towards. Brian Alexander was among the many people looking at the jobs available. He said he was looking for a change after spending a decade drywalling. He hadn’t been to a career fair since he was 16 but was pleased with the turnout Thursday, he said. Louise Hyatt, a human-resources technician with Proctor and Gamble, said she too was pleased with the turnout. “It’s been really busy here today. There was a lineup at the door when we opened here this morning,” said Hyatt. Hers was one of many companies that were encouraging people to submit their resumés online.
