This research report also lists 10 other prominent vendors that are expected to impact the market during the forecast period. In an attempt to increase the awareness of the availability of products and build brand image in emerging markets such as Brazil, China, India, Russia, and Malaysia, manufacturers of dishwashing detergents are focusing on innovation, consumer understanding, branding, productivity, and go-to-market execution.

Ask an analyst: http://www.technavio.com/content/ask-analyst?report=53210 Ask Technavio's lead analysts a question about this market and they will have your answer within 24 hours. Competitive vendor landscape According to the report, the global dishwashing detergent market is marked by the presence of multiple established vendors offering a wide array of products. Major players operating in this space include P&G, Unilever, Reckitt Benckiser, Henkel, and Colgate-Palmolive and are very competitive in terms of their product offerings. Unilever, Reckitt Benckiser, and Henkel are European MNCs based in the Netherlands, the UK, and Germany, respectively, while P&G and Colgate-Palmolive are North American companies based in the US. In 2015, the three European MNCs together contributed 19.84% of the global revenue, whereas the other two companies contributed 26.42% of the global revenue for household cleaners at large. "While P&G is a leading player in all categories of household cleaners, Reckitt Benckiser is a leading vendor in the automatic dishwashing detergent segment with its brand Finish and in surface cleaners," says Brijesh Kumar Choubey, a lead retail goods and services research analyst from Technavio.

Top five dishwashing detergent market vendors Colgate-Palmolive Colgate-Palmolive has a strong brand image, which improves its credibility among customers. The company's strong brand image makes it a leader in many product categories of global oral care and personal care markets through its flagship brands Colgate, Palmolive, Protex, Irish Spring, and Softsoap. The company also has a significant share of the global home care market through its flagship brands Ajax, Palmolive, and Fabuloso. Henkel Henkel has been focusing on untapped markets such as MEA to promote its household cleaning products. The company is building its own growth opportunity in these markets by introducing new lines of its globally popular brands of household cleaning products. In 2015, the launch of Pril 100 Lemons Power in MEA was successful. In addition, the company is focusing on introducing innovative hand and automatic dishwashing products. In 2015, the company launched the new variant Pur Gold Care under the Pur brand in Eastern Europe, in the hand dishwashing category. The innovative formula of this product is especially effective against odors. P&G The company focuses strongly on product development and research activities for bringing new products into the markets. It constantly concentrates on internal and external R&D in order to launch new products and enhance its existing product portfolio. Innovative new products earned P&G five of the top 10 spots in the IRI New Product Pacesetters ranking of the most successful non-food product launches of 2015. Among these five the list contained two lines from the home care segment, including Gain Flings and Cascade Platinum. This achievement has underscored P&G's focus on driving business growth through a strong portfolio of innovative products. Reckitt Benckiser Reckitt Benckiser has positioned its dishwashing brand Finish as the first automatic dishwashing detergent brand. The company has thus achieved fast-mover advantage and the brand has become the top selling brand for automatic dishwashing. The company continues to launch of new lines under the Finish brand to provide more specific solutions for consumers. For instance, during the first quarter of 2016, the company launched Finish Supercharged Powerball. Through this launch the brand had a good start for 2016 and had been witnessing a significant sales growth in the US. Unilever In 2015, the home care segment of Unilever provided a year of underlying growth. The underlying sales growth was at 5.9% in 2015. The home care segment also witnessed an increase in operating margin by 1.3% (operating margin was 7.6% and 6.3%, respectively, in 2015 and 2014. The growth stemmed from a strong range of new product launches, including Comfort Intense and Omo, which had a global re-launch with an upgraded formulation.

But many of them pack a total-return punch, too. Thinkstock By Dan Burrows September 16, 2016 With the market not far off all-time highs, you might think it’s not the best time to go looking for the best dividend stocks to buy. You’d be wrong. Just because dividend yields market-wide are off versus a year ago doesn’t mean dividend stocks any less attractive for long-term investors. Indeed, dividend stocks never go out of style for patient investors. See Also from Kiplinger: 8 Risky Stocks That Are Worth a Gamble Be that as it may, yields on the best dividend stocks in the S&P 500 aren’t what they once were. Sure, companies are increasing their dividend payments, but share-price gains are offsetting any bump to dividend yield. Just look at the dividend yield on the S&P 500. It’s down to 2.12% today vs. 2.2% a year ago — not large on the aggregate, but it’s not the right direction, either. In a way, the thirst for yield only makes the search for the best dividend stocks even more important. The key is to get the largest yield possible with the least amount of risk. Advertisement Large caps — preferably blue chips — with ample yields and a long history of rising payouts will serve your equity income portfolio well if given enough time. Although current yields may be underwhelming, they won’t stay that way on your own personal costs basis if you hang on through hike after hike. The trick is to find the best S&P 500 dividend stocks and hang on. Here are the top names in the index. Procter & Gamble Dividend Yield: 3.1% Advertisement It doesn’t get more blue chip than Procter & Gamble Co. (PG). This component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average has paid rising dividends since the 19th century. That gives investors confidence that the payouts will keep coming no matter what. Admittedly, Procter & Gamble isn’t running completely unimpeded. Its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report saw earnings and revenues decline thanks to hiccups in the beauty, home care and other divisions. Still, PG is getting its house in order. It’s in the midst of a $10 billion cost-cutting program, which is something that is always music to the market’s ears. It’s also returning billions of dollars to shareholders via stock buybacks. Happily, defensive names like Procter & Gamble are in vogue these days. PG stock is up 10% for the year-to-date vs. a gain of less than 5% for the broader market. Advertisement Wells Fargo Dividend Yield: 3.2% OK, Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) might not be the most popular name after its jaw-dropping accounts scandal, but so what? It’s still a quality business with a quality stock. Wells Fargo’s reputation took a hit, and now Congress is doing its typical bluster — this time over senior management. Advertisement But, as bank crises do, this will blow over. Shares in WFC went to $46 from $51 on the news. That has the dividend up to a very attractive level. True, banks are constrained when it comes to formulating their capital plans. But — again — the scandal doesn’t have anything to do with capital requirements. See Also from Kiplinger: 6 Good Dividend Stocks Yielding 5% or More When you can get one of the nation’s top banks on sale, you go for it. Cisco Systems Dividend Yield: 3.4% Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) is one of the first names when it comes to tech dividends. But Cisco offers a heck of a lot more than just dividends. CSCO is following the same playbook as every other legacy tech name. It’s making the long, painful and slow transition to cloud-based services and away from hardware. The arrow hasn’t always been pointed up, but Cisco has been regularly topping Wall Street’s earnings and revenue targets. Cost cuts also increase investor confidence in this company Cisco has been a total-return machine so far this year, with price appreciation of nearly 15% on top of the healthy dividend. With cloud-based services still ramping up, you can expect more of the same. Boeing Dividend Yield: 3.4% It’s in fashion to worry about Boeing Co. (BA), but the company isn’t that troubled. Boeing beat analysts’ profit estimate over the summer and the cash-flow picture continued to strengthen. In a tip to the benefits of diversification, margin growth in the company’s defense business is making up for some of the drag coming out of the commercial segment. Right now, Boeing is duking it out with Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) over a combat jet deal in Denmark — a rare challenge in the international defense world. See Also from InvestorPlace: 7 Stock Splits Investors Are Dying to See BA stock is still off for the year-to-date with an 11% decline. That underperforms the broader market by a wide margin, but it also has the dividend yield flying high. Gushers of cash flow ensure that the payouts will keep coming. Pfizer Dividend Yield: 3.5% Mega-Pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (PFE) is on a mergers and acquisitions bender that promises long-term price appreciation to go along with a steady dividend stream. PFE’s $14 billion acquisition of Medivation bolsters the long-term bull case on Pfizer stock. The pharmaceutical giant is building up its oncology portfolio in a big way. It already has a hit with Ibrance, a breast cancer drug on the cusp of becoming a blockbuster, and MDVN complements that nicely. Then there’s the $5.2 billion acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals, which landed Pfizer crisaborole — a non-steroid eczema treatment that’s being studied for efficacy against psoriasis. Like a lot of defensive names, PFE is having a good year. Shares are up 6% for the year-to-date. The S&P 500 is ahead by only 4.5% so far in 2016. IBM Dividend Yield: 3.6% International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) is another classic tech name trying to get with the times. Happily for shareholders, last quarter’s report showed good progress with its turnaround plan. IBM beat Street forecasts on the top and bottom line thanks partly to its focus on new business areas. The legacy business continued to shrink, but that was partially offset by growth in the segment that includes things like Watson, security and cloud computing. Analytics, social and mobile are also some of the keys to IBM’s future. Watson alone is a reason to love this company, with Deloitte estimating that the cognitive computing market could reach $50 billion in the next five years — in just the U.S.! IBM stock is another total-return winner these days. It’s up 13% YTD on price alone. And the dividend has nearly doubled over the past half-decade. AbbVie Dividend Yield: 3.6% AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) stock is having a market-beating year with its gain of more than 7%, and the dividend only pads that lead. Slow-but-steady growth is a basic part of the equation. AbbVie successfully completed the acquisition of Stemcentrx in June, which bolsters its portfolio of oncology treatments. In other fundamentally good news, the FDA recently approved Humira in non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adult patients. That makes it the only non-steroidal drug available for the disease. With a long-term growth rate of more than 15%, the forward price-to-earnings multiple of 11 gives ABBV a compelling valuation. And dividend growth is fantastic. AbbVie has only been around since 2013, and its payout has grown by more than 40% in that short time. Verizon Dividend Yield: 4.49% You can’t talk about dividend stocks without talking about the telecommunications sector. That’s why you have to look at Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ). Sure, Verizon is boring, but it’s supposed to be. As much as traditional telecommunications is a poky business, VZ is making some interesting moves. Most famously it recently acquired the core properties of Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) to drive new revenue streams and position itself for the future. And a little further back, Verizon acquired AOL. You might scoff at Verizon picking up has-been Internet properties, but they actually provide VZ with potential growth in digital content and advertising technology. See Also from Kiplinger: 4 High-Yield Dividend Stocks Worth the Risk And lest you think defense is not cool, VZ stock is up 12% so far in 2016. If it can keep up its mojo, it will continue to be a total-return monster. AT&T Dividend Yield: 4.8% Speaking of total-return monsters, you have to give a shout out to AT&T Inc. (T). Verizon’s main competitor routinely offers one of the heftier dividend yields in the S&P 500. Even if this were just a list of the largest dividends in the index, T would warrant a spot. But AT&T isn’t just a high dividend — it’s a high-quality dividend. An earnings beat helped by its acquisition of DirecTV and advances in the wireless business was applauded by the market and analysts alike. After some upgrades, fully 15 of the 31 analysts covering the stock rate it a buy. See Also from InvestorPlace: The 5 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks With the Highest Yields More impressively is that shares are having a huge year. T stock is up 17% YTD. That has weighed on the dividend yield, to be sure … but then, where else are you going to get that sort of return for this kind of risk? General Motors Dividend Yield: 4.9% The market is rightly worried about General Motors Co. (GM) hitting the peak of the latest car-buying cycle, but it’s overdoing its concerns. It feels like GM stock has been discounted for a worst-case scenario, if not more. GM once again printed strong quarterly numbers back in July. It set a record for earnings and lifted its full-year guidance. Higher-margin pickup trucks and large SUVs helped pick up the slack, and Europe has even become a positive once more. If we’re at the cyclical peak, don’t tell General Motors. This article is from Dan Burrows of InvestorPlace. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Now Playing Psychodrama/Marshall Law Letters to the Editors FAQ About Tip Line "The Papers" archive RSS Beachwood Link Buttons Media Kit/Advertising   The [Thursday] Papers By Steve Rhodes "Battery maker Duracell is opening an office downtown today, bringing over 60 executive jobs to Chicago," Crain's reports. "Mayor Rahm Emanuel is to make the announcement today." I'm not going to say it's a bad thing that Duracell is moving some executive jobs here, but if you look at the big picture, it's not necessarily a good thing, either. Here's why: * February 19, Cincinnati Business Courier: "Procter & Gamble's David Taylor spoke Thursday about the need to 'wow' consumers with innovative brands and packaging, but the new CEO's comments were crafted to create a good first impression with market analysts. "Taylor, who spoke publicly for the first time since taking charge of the Cincinnati-based company, tried to wow analysts by committing to $10 billion in new productivity savings over the next five years." I hope we all understand what is meant by the phrase "productivity savings." * March 1, Cincinnati Business Courier: "Procter & Gamble Co. shed 2,700 employees and about $2.5 billion in annual sales when it closed on the transfer of its Duracell battery division to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. this week." * March 3, Danbury (CT) News-Times: "As Berkshire Hathaway closed its acquisition of Duracell this week, the Bethel-based battery maker appeared to be settling on Chicago - where its new CEO works - as its de facto headquarters. "Duracell and Berkshire Hathaway have made no announcement designating Chicago as Duracell's new headquarters, and on Thursday Duracell spokesman Richard Abramowitz told Hearst that the battery maker's main office will remain in Bethel. "But an online job ad for Duracell disclosed an intent to set up camp in there, and Abramowitz confirmed that CEO Angelo Pantaleo is hiring corporate staff to work in a new Duracell office in the Windy City . . . "The job ad posted on the website of Indeed.com states that 'Duracell is building out its corporate and strategic functions and looking for key talent across multiple functions' as a result of moving its headquarters to Chicago. Abramowitz said the job ad was old and indicated Bethel remains Duracell's formal headquarters. "We are not moving anybody to Chicago," Abramowitz said. "Any shift of Duracell's main corporate office - whether on paper or in functional practice - would mark Connecticut's second major defection in as many months, after Fairfield-based General Electric announced plans to relocate its headquarters and 200 jobs to Boston this summer. "Procter & Gamble picked up Duracell as part of its 2005 acquisition of Boston-based Gillette, and had in 2014 planned to spin it off as an independent, publicly traded company. "At the time, Duracell indicated it would keep its Bethel headquarters, which was constructed in 1995 on a hill above Berkshire Corporate Park. "Duracell is the second largest taxpayer in the town after Eversource Energy, according to the most recent figures from the Connecticut Economic Resource Center." Duracell may be adding jobs by building out its executive suite, but it's consolidating elsewhere - despite the continuing enormous profits of its new owner, as we shall see. * July 28, Charlotte Business Journal: "Duracell will close its 430-employee AA battery plant in Lancaster over the coming three years, eliminating one of that county's largest private employers . . . "Lancaster County Administrator Steve Willis says the decision means Duracell will leave the county after 35 years of making batteries in the community. "Willis has told others in the Lancaster County community that the decision to close the plant had nothing to do with the performance at the battery factory. Instead, the move is 'coming down from corporate,' he says . . . "With the closing of the plant, Duracell will likely have to give up some of the local incentives the company was granted two years ago in exchange for a $69 million spend at the Lancaster plant. In 2014, Lancaster County agreed to cut its property taxes for 30 years in exchange for the upgrades at the plant." * July 28, Reuters: "Duracell said the move will lead to 'some' job growth in LaGrange, which is about 330 miles (531 km) southwest of Lancaster, and that Lancaster workers will be encouraged to apply for work there. "The company, which said it has about 3,000 employees, also makes C and D batteries in a plant in Cleveland, Tennessee." * July 27, The Chattanoogan: "James Ronald 'Ronnie' Anderson, 69, of Cleveland, Tennessee, passed away on Monday, July 25, 2016 in a local hospital. "He was born on May 29, 1947 to the late JW and June Anderson. He was a Vietnam veteran in the United States Navy. He retired from Duracell with over 30 years of employment. He enjoyed boating, fishing, and camping. But his greatest joy was spending time with his granddaughter Gracie." The obits of papers where Duracell divisions are located are littered with folks like this. Let's keep business stories human. Oops, too late . . . * August 5, Bloomberg News: "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said second-quarter profit rose 25 percent on earnings from newly acquired manufacturing businesses and improved results at insurance operations. "Net income climbed to $5 billion from $4.01 billion a year earlier, the Omaha, Neb.-based company said Friday after the market closed. "Berkshire's businesses represent a cross-section of the economy and provide Buffett, 85, with a steady stream of cash for more investments. Since the start of the year, he's added to the company's manufacturing operations, completing deals for battery-maker Duracell and for Precision Castparts, a global supplier to the aerospace industry. Those businesses have helped bolster results, as did a rebound at auto insurer Geico . . . "The cash pile climbed to $72.7 billion as of June 30 from $58.3 billion three months earlier, helped by Kraft Heinz's redemption of preferred shares for about $8.3 billion. The extra funds add to Buffett's resources for another major acquisition. "'He's got to do something to deploy that cash,' S&P's Seifert said. 'People are going to wonder where the next acquisition comes from.'" What in the world to do with all this cash?! * August 7, The Lancaster News: "According to tax records, Duke Energy is the county's largest taxpayer and Duracell is the second largest. "The city of Lancaster, Lancaster County and the Lancaster County School District all depend on property tax revenue generated by the 300,000-square-foot plant, though the level of dependency varies. "This year, Duracell paid about $1.2 million in school taxes, $474,000 in county taxes and $608,000 in municipal taxes to the city of Lancaster . . . "Duracell is the municipality's largest taxpayer and one of its top three water users, said City Finance Director James Absher. This past year the battery manufacturer paid $147,000 for water and sewer services, he said. "But Absher said that isn't as big an issue as the $608,000 potential loss in property taxes. "While taxes will still be paid on the property, it will drop in value once the machinery is removed. "'It means I lose 6 percent of our general fund budget,' Absher said. 'And under state law, we can't get it back by raising millage. When you lose something like that, you just can't make it up elsewhere. We hope something comes in to replace Duracell, but you prepare for the worst and hope for the best,' he said. "Already stretched to the financial hilt by a flat tax base, the city is in the early stages of complying with a time-sensitive EPA-mandated consent order on sewer system upgrades that could cost up to $18 million. "There are also other issues, such as police department pay and higher employee health insurance premiums, as well as the cost of providing services to its citizens. "'Of all the things we could imagine happening, losing Duracell was not one of them, said Lancaster City Councilwoman Jackie Harris. 'It was as big a surprise for us as their employees' . . . "Outlaw said in the past five years, Duracell's employees have donated a combined $609,000 for the United Way community campaign and the 15 local agencies supported by the annual fundraiser. "'It's in the culture of their employees,' she said. 'Not only that, many of them take it a step further and become volunteers for the agencies they support.'" * August 12, The Lancaster News: "Two years ago, Lancaster County gave Duracell property tax incentives designed to save the company about $11 million over three decades in return for the battery manufacturer spending $69 million over five years to upgrade its plant. "It's the kind of deal Lancaster and most other counties make often. Duracell gets to divert tax payments into profits, and the county secures good-paying manufacturing jobs. Those workers support their families and spend their money locally, supporting many more jobs and families. "But what happens when things don't work out as planned? "Duracell announced last month that it will start phasing out production at its Lancaster plant next spring and shut down by 2019, eliminating 430 jobs. "It started benefiting from the tax incentives in 2014. What happens to the deal now? Do we get money back? "Maybe, but it's really complicated, Lancaster County Administrator Steve Willis said Thursday. "'For this year, nothing changes,' Willis said. 'After that, County Attorney John Weaver will consult with Mike Ey to see what we have to do' . . . "There have been at least three such agreements with Duracell over the years. Before the 2014 deal, the last one was in 2008. It involved $60 million in production-line upgrades. Each new deal supersedes the last one. "The 2014 agreement called for Duracell to pay an annual fee of $73,645 for 30 years and then pay less in property taxes for the county, the city and the school district." * August 14, The Lancaster News: "Jamie Gilbert knew building Lancaster County's new economic development department would be a big challenge, but the news he got on his eighth day at work was a punch in the gut. "Duracell, the county's seventh-largest employer, announced it would phase out production at its Lancaster manufacturing plant starting next spring, and that all 400-plus jobs would be gone within two years . . . "The Duracell move shocked Lancaster's business community. Just two years ago, the county gave the battery maker an economic incentive package worth $11 million in return for a $69 million production-line upgrade by the company. "All indications were that Duracell, bought by Berkshire Hathaway in 2015, was here to stay." - Lessons: * What's good for executives is rarely good for workers - and often involves the redistribution of wealth upwards. * When companies move here - whole hog or just executive suites - there is pain elsewhere that we shouldn't ignore. It's nothing to celebrate if the bottom line hurts more people than it helps. * Companies and executives who move here aren't automatically good corporate citizens just because they are now "ours." * I sense a trend of HQs moving here because CEOs who already live here don't want to move to where their companies are actually already located.

Home About Us The Catholic Free Press Mission Friends of The Free Press Who’s Who Photo Galleries Contact Us Subscribe to Catholic Free Press Advertise with The Catholic Free Press Order Diocesan Directory Links Sep 16 TV star Frank Runyeon imparts lessons in Blackstone Posted By The Catholic Free Press September 16, 2016 | 4:39 pm | Featured Article #2 Facebook0 Twitter0 Pinterest0 Google+0 LinkedIn0 By Tanya Connor | The Catholic Free Press BLACKSTONE – God should be at the center, but he’s been cut out of life. That makes it harder to teach the faith. This message was communicated Sunday, Sept. 11, when television star Frank Runyeon spoke to religious education students, teachers and parents at St. Theresa Parish. But then he showed how children can make a difference. Mr. Runyeon has translated and adapted biblical texts for his one-man dramas, including “Luke: Stories on the Road,” which he presented Tuesday, Sept. 13, for a parish mission here, and “The Letter of James: What are you doing?” presented Wednesday. Sunday he performed “Salt and Light” for grades 1-5, and talked to grades 6-10 about “Hollywood versus Faith.” Mr. Runyeon’s familiar with the actor’s world. He starred for seven years on “As the World Turns” and for four years on the Emmy-award-winning “Santa Barbara,” according to his website. He’s also acted in other shows and hosted his own radio talk show. On Sunday he offered glimpses behind the scenes, recounting how he was told he hadn’t been hired to do quality acting or present life as it is, but to “sell soap.” (Soap-maker Procter and Gamble sponsored soap operas, advertising its products.) News broadcasts too are designed to “get you to sit through the commercials,” and begin with the bloodiest story, Mr. Runyeon said. And entertainment focuses on violence and death “so you stop for a second, like (at) a terrible accident.” Often when they are facing hardships, people bargain with God, he said. But filmmakers don’t usually show characters talking to God because people disagree about God, he said. And, in public school, people are not to talk about God, he said. But you can’t put God to the side, because what is in the center of your life becomes your god, he explained. He also drew other contrasts between screen and scriptural values. In commercials one is told that happiness comes from buying things, but Jesus says, “Sell all your stuff.” (Mt 19:21) Females are told happiness is in how they look, so they focus on weight loss, sometimes nearly killing themselves. But St. Paul said, “Your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit” (I Cor 6:19). The culture emphasizes winning, Mr. Runyeon noted. Students are pushed to get As, so they think losing is the worst thing, he said, telling of a student who hung himself because he only heard the story “out there” in the world. The story in church might not seem as enticing, “it just happens to be the truth,” he said. It’s about relationships with people and, most importantly, God. He urged listeners, “Have a relationship with the One who is the truth.” “It’s actually pretty true,” Allison Sawyer, 13, said of Mr. Runyeon’s talk, adding that youth are pressured to get good grades. She said maybe teachers or parents should tell them not to worry; they will still get a house and a job. “I thought it was really inspiring,” said Toni Marino, 13. “It made sense, why all the movies have pretty girls in them.” The talk helped her understand why pretty girls get everything they want, and others don’t, she said. She said now she’ll question things, not just assume they’re true. “We just need people that are able to communicate the message,” said her father, John Marino, a confirmation teacher. “He gives teachers and educators a lot of good talking points.… It reminded me that we have to encourage these kids not to just listen to what’s being fed them (but) to question everything that they see.” Mr. Runyeon helped parents understand why there’s a disconnect for youth when they’re taught about the faith, he said. He said adults are quick to judge and simply tell students to pay attention. “I wished I could do that for my students – what he did for me,” said Deborah Champeau, a grade 8 religious education teacher born in 1951. “It’s not that complicated … God at the center of everything. We grew up in a different time.… All of my friends – God was a part of their lives.” Now, she said, Catholicism is like a second language that seems irrelevant to students. Mr. Runyeon used drama to make Scripture relevant to students in grades 1-5. Like an actor’s script, Scripture “tells us the part we’re supposed to play,” he said. Dramatizing Jesus’ “riddles” – “You are the salt of the earth” and “You are the light of the world” – Mr. Runyeon pretended young listeners were a salt shaker and a light bulb. He said people are like salt when they bring out the goodness in others and keep things from going bad. They are like light when they show others the right way to go. Mr. Runyeon incorporated these challenges into his dramatization of King Herod’s birthday party, at which Herod made a rash promise to the dancer, which led to the killing of John the Baptist (Mk 6:14-29). “John the Baptist died,” Mr. Runyeon said. “That’s what can happen when we forget to be salt and light.” But he said there was a happy ending – John went to heaven. “Do you know we really do have a King, and we’re in the court of our King right now?” Mr. Runyeon asked. He had listeners put their hands on their hearts, face the tabernacle and sing, to the tune of “Happy Birthday,”: “I’ll be salt for you. I’ll be salt for you. I’ll be salt not pepper. Not pepper, Kachoo!” Sign up for our free E-Report Subscriptions 1-year Paper/eEdition : $30.00 USD - yearly 1-year eEdition only : $30.00 USD - yearly 1-year paper only : $30.00 USD - yearly Advertisements Charlton Manor Rest Home Advertise with The Catholic Free Press Browse categories Local National International Vatican Commentary Spiritual Social/Video CNS News RSS Feed Widget Copyright © 2016 Catholic Free Press.

I miss the Olympics. For the better part of August, we watched most of the summer Olympics coverage on television. I miss the runners and the hurdlers and searching for coverage of the high jumpers. I miss the swimmers and the cyclists and the soccer players. I miss the drama of the gymnastics, even if that event often seems so maddeningly subjective. I don't miss the golf, but I do miss the beach volleyball. I also miss those "Thank you, Mom" commercials from Procter & Gamble. You know, the ones where the moms are always there for their young athletes—taking them to practice and picking them up ... and picking them up off the floor or field when they fall or fail. The latest version shows moms saving their kids from tornados and hoodlums, soothing their terrified youngsters during a car accident and a turbulent plane ride, proving that, yes, it does take someone strong to make someone strong. Cue the tears. Because of the Rio Games and because it's been on my to-read list, "The Boys in the Boat" by Daniel James Brown was in my beach book bag this summer. This true story of the University of Washington rowing team—sons of loggers, farmers, and shipyard workers—and their quest for gold against the world's most elite teams at the 1936 Berlin Olympics was every bit as good as I expected. It's been out for a few years, and while I was late to that game, reading it just now feels timely to me. So I started looking for other Olympics-related reads and came up with lots of winning titles for readers of all ages. Here are just a few: "Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience and Redemption" by Laura Hillenbrand: The movie was amazing; the award-winning book is even better. A delinquent who channeled his defiance into running, Louis Zamperini competed in the Berlin Games and later became an airman during World War II. His bomber crashed in the Pacific Ocean, and he survived starvation, sharks, enemy aircraft, and then unimaginable brutality in a POW camp. "Gold" by Chris Cleave: This novel about love and sacrifice, by the author of the bestselling "Little Bee," is the story of a world-class athlete named Kate Meadows. Her daughter is battling a recurrence of childhood leukemia just as Kate is about to compete for her last chance at an Olympic gold medal. Kate, who already has sacrificed a lot, has a difficult decision to make. "Triumph: The Untold Story of Jesse Owens and Hitler's Olympics" by Jeremy Schaap: The Owens family gave ESPN national correspondent Schaap unprecedented access, and the author did his research well to tell the story of the African-American son of Alabama sharecroppers who won four gold medals at the 1936 games in Nazi Germany—performing in a way that not only made history but also transcended sports.  "Wilma Unlimited: How Wilma Rudolph Became the World's Fastest Woman" by Kathleen Krull, illustrated by Caldecott Medal-winning artist David Diaz: Wilma Rudolph was only 16 when she competed in the 1956 Melbourne Games on the 4x100 relay team, winning a bronze medal. She followed that up with a triple-gold track-and-field performance in Rome four years later—becoming the first American woman to do so in a single Olympiad. Even more inspiring in this book for young readers: When Wilma was four, her left leg was paralyzed by polio, and doctors predicted (quite wrongly) that she would never walk again. She, of course, vowed to run. "Grace, Gold and Glory: My Leap of Faith" by Gabrielle Douglas: Douglas first captured our hearts with her high-flying leaps way above the balance beam at the 2012 London Games where she was the All-Around Gold Medal winner. This autobiography tells her story of faith, perseverance, and determination. "Running for My Life: One Lost Boy's Journey from the Killing Fields of Sudan to the Olympic Games" by Lopez Lomong: This true story of a Sudanese child refugee who became an Olympic athlete is about much more than just track and field—or Africa, for that matter. It's about faith and fortitude and daring to pursue seemingly impossible dreams.  "A Passion for Victory: The Story of the Olympics in Ancient and Early Modern Times" by Benson Bobrick: This book for young readers chronicles the Olympic games from the barefoot races of 8th century BC to the Berlin Games before World War II. Did you know there were underwater obstacle courses in the early 20th century games? Using the archeological record and more modern history, this book explores the international fixation on the Olympic games (and the social and political implications) and uses interesting anecdotes, athlete profiles, and historic events to detail each installment.

Here's some advice for you. Mark Hulbert, Special to USA TODAY 5:03 p.m. EDT September 16, 2016 Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share These 10 voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee decide interest rates for the Federal Reserve. Concerned about where markets are going? Consumer staples may be the place to be. (Photo: Getty) Have the stock market’s big drops over the last week convinced you that we’re now in a bear market? If so, you might want to favor consumer staples stocks and avoid financials. And if you instead are giving the bull market the benefit of the doubt? Believe it or not, the same advice applies. Ned Davis Research found that, just as was the case with bear markets, consumer staples are one of the better relative performers over the last few months of bull markets — and financials was one of the worst. Consumer Staples, of course, are goods that we need all the time — such as food, beverages and basic household items — and which therefore are relatively resistant to the ebb and flow of the economy. The largest two consumer staples companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index are Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola. USA TODAY Pipeline leak jolts gas prices in Southeast The financials sector, in contrast, is very much cyclical. It consists of banks and other financial service firms. The largest bank in the S&P 500, for example, is JPMorgan. In contrast to these two sectors, the fortunes of the other S&P 500 sectors depend heavily on whether we’re in a late-stage bull market or early in a bear market. Consider the consumer discretionary sector, which contains companies such as home improvement retailer Lowe's and online seller Amazon.com. Not surprisingly, this sector is at or near the top of the sector rankings for late-bull-market performance, according to the Ned Davis data — but near the bottom during the first months of bear markets. Before investing in sectors like consumer discretionary it’s crucial to determine whether we’re in a bull or a bear market. Since the vast majority of stock market timers are unable to consistently forecast major market turning points, playing the sector rotation game can be risky. There are several reasons why the performance ranks of the consumer staples and financials sectors are steadier. One reason that consumer staples companies don’t take a big a turn for the worse in bear markets, for example, is that we need the goods they produce no matter how bad our financial situation might become. USA TODAY What schools teach kids about money is scary Higher interest rates are a primary cause of the consistently poor performance of financial stocks at the end of bull markets and the beginning of bears. Rising rates cut into such companies’ profits and, historically, rates have begun to rise several months before bull markets have come to an end. This is particularly relevant today, given the market’s intense speculation that the Federal Reserve might raise rates as soon as its meeting on Sept. 20-21. Even if you are uncertain whether the bull market has ended or will do so soon, you might be able to sleep more easily at night by reducing your exposure to financials and reinvesting the proceeds in consumer staples stocks. To be sure, you won’t be the first to make this bet. Of the three dozen consumer staples stocks within the S&P 500, in fact, just four have price/earnings ratios that are lower than that of the overall market. But those four deserve a second look: Mondelez International (MDLZ), the maker of snacks and beverages; Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), the agribusiness company; and two major retailers: Kroger (KR), and Walmart Stores (WMT).

According to sources with the Wall Street Journal, Jessica Alba’s Honest Company is in early negotiations with Unilever PLC for the “green” company’s possible sale. Honest is reportedly valued somewhere between $1 billion and $1.7 billion. (The latter is a recent valuation.) Alba’s fast-growing operation has given heavy-hitters like Proctor & Gamble a run for their money by vowing to offer responsibly made products that don’t contain harsh chemicals and and has built a loyally following among environmentally-conscientious mothers. Honest reportedly brings in roughly $300 million in annual revenue. No deal has been struck yet, and the company is still reportedly considering an initial public offering as an alternative.

The recent trigger that has brought up rate hike worries all over again is the U.S. consumer price inflation report for August, which came in more than expected, signaling that there is some scope for upward maneuvering of rates. Commodities are all in the red, as the dollar is firming up. In the absence of any major catalysts, traders may prefer to be on the sidelines or lighten their holdings ahead of next week's two major central bank decisions. U.S. stocks advanced solidly on Thursday, with tempered rate hike fears serving as a spring board for the markets to rebound from recent weakness. The major averages opened higher, as traders digested a slew of soft domestic data, which allayed fears concerning a near-term interest rate hike. The averages rose steadily before ending notably higher. The Dow Industrials added 177.71 points or 0.99 percent before ending at 18,213, the S&P 500 Index closed 21.49 points or 1.01 percent higher at 2,147 and the Nasdaq Composite ended at 5,250, up 75.92 points or 1.47 percent. All thirty Dow components closed the session higher, with Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Merck (MRK), Microsoft (MSFT), UnitedHealth (UNH), Caterpillar (CAT), Wal-Mart (WMT) and Procter & Gamble (PG) leading the gains. Among the sectors, semiconductor, computer hardware, brokerage, energy and biotechnology stocks showed notable moves to the upside. On the economic front, the Labor Department reported that jobless claims rose to 260,000 in the week ended September 10th from 259,000 in the previous week. The four-week average eased to 260,750 from 261,250. Continuing claims calculated with a week's lag were little changed at 2.143 million in the week ended September 3rd. The Commerce Department reported that retail sales slipped 0.3 percent month-over-month in August following a revised 0.1 percent gain in July. Excluding autos, retail sales declined a more modest 0.1 percent compared to the 0.4 percent decline in July. Auto sales fell 0.9 percent following July's 1.7 percent jump. The decline in building material and garden equipment store sales steepened to 1.4 percent from 0.7 percent. Miscellaneous store and non-store retail sales also saw notable decreases. However, the drop in furniture and home furnishing store sales slowed to 0.7 percent from 1.1 percent and electronic store sales rebounded by 0.1 percent. Food and beverage sales rebounded. Gasoline store sales fell at a slower pace of 0.8 percent. A separate Commerce Department report showed that business inventories remained virtually unchanged in July compared to the previous month. Annually, inventories climbed 0.5 percent. Business sales edged down 0.2 percent month-over-month and were 0.8 percent lower from last year. The business inventories/sales ratio rose to 1.39 in July from 1.37 in the year-ago period. The Labor Department report on producer prices showed tame inflationary pressure. The producer price index for final demand was unchanged in August compared to the previous month, while economists expected a 0.1 percent increase. The core producer price index for final demand rose at a faster 0.3 percent clip compared to a flat reading in June. The results of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's business outlook survey showed that its diffusion index of business activity rose sharply to 12.8 in September from 2 in August. However, the inner details were mixed. The new orders index rose to 1.4 from -7.2, while the unfilled orders index was at an anemic -10.8. The shipments index and the employee index were also in negative territory. Meanwhile, the New York Federal Reserve's survey showed that manufacturing activity in the region continued to contract in September. The general business conditions index improved to -1.99 in September from -4.21 in August, while economists expected a reading of -1. The new orders and unfilled orders indexes were at -7.45 and -11.61, respectively. The employment index is deep in the red at -14.29. Industrial production fell 0.4 month-over-month in August, according to a report released by the Federal Reserve. Economists expect a 0.2 percent drop. Manufacturing output also declined 0.4 percent, reversing the 0.4 percent increase in July and steeper than the 0.3 percent drop expected by economists. Capacity utilization eased 0.4 percentage points to 75.5 percent. Currency, Commodity Markets Crude oil futures for October delivery are slipping $0.83 to $43.08 barrel after rising $0.33 to $43.91 a barrel on Thursday. Gold futures are currently trading at $1,312.80 an ounce, down $5 from the previous session's close of $1,318 an ounce, which represented a 2-week low. On Thursday, gold fell $8. 10. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 102.01 yen compared to the 102.10 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Thursday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1201 compared to yesterday's $1.1244. Asia Asian stocks rebounded from a six-week low, encouraged by Wall Street's rally overnight. The markets in China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, South Korea and Taiwan were closed for public holidays. The Japanese market rose as the yen remained subdued at the lower 102-levels. The Nikkei 225 Index opened higher and moved roughly sideways in a broad range in the morning before advancing in the afternoon. The index ended up 114.28 points or 0.70 percent at 16,519. The Australian market rose for a third straight day, as easing Fed rate hike worries helped lift stocks across the board. The All Ordinaries index closed up 59.60 points or 1.12 percent at 5,397. The market witnessed broad based strength, with utility, telecom, consumer discretionary and financial stocks making strong advances. Europe The European markets moved about in a lackluster manner in the morning after rebounding from a 5-session decline yesterday. The averages opened higher but saw a volatile bout in the morning. The averages are currently notably lower, as U.S. inflation data has served to intensify the weakness. In major corporate news, Deutsche Bank (DB) said it has no intent to pay the $14 billion sought by the U.S. Justice Department to settle potential civil claims anywhere near the number cited. U.S. Economic Reports Consumer prices in the U.S. increased by slightly more than expected in the month of August, according to a report released by the Labor Department. The Labor Department said its consumer price index rose by 0.2 percent in August after coming in unchanged in July. Economists had expected prices to inch up by 0.1 percent. Excluding food and energy prices, core consumer prices climbed by 0.3 percent in August after edging up by 0.1 percent in July. Core prices had been expected to rise by 0.2 percent. The University of Michigan is scheduled to release its preliminary U.S. consumer sentiment index for September at 10 am ET. The index is expected to increase to 90.8 from 89.8. Stocks in Focus Oracle (ORCL) reported below-consensus results for its first quarter and issued weak earnings forecast for the second quarter, as its traditional software business weakens. Authentic Brand Group (ABG), General Growth Properties (GGP) and Simon Property Group (SPG) finalized the acquisition of Aeropostale.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A      Investing makes for one fantastic spectator sport. After this past week’s rising volatility, no doubt many investors are wishing they had taken some money off the table while things were quiet. Yet investing, when done properly, is a much better participatory sport. There’s nothing quite like taking some capital, moving it into your new favorite stock, and feeling overjoyed as it rallies. But it’s not that simple. It requires the patience and determination to deal with short-term market uncertainty. That’s why many investors employ a strategy you may have heard of: passive investing. It simply means buying the entire market via an index fund, and having no strong opinion either way. The market’s return becomes your return (after a tiny sliver of fees is taken out). That’s definitely a great way to invest if you don’t have the time to find great opportunities. If you use a tax-deferred account as well, like a 401(k) plan or an IRA, the tax benefits mean you’ll fare even better than the market over time. The upside is you’re invested in the entire market. The downside is that you’re invested in the entire market. If some individual names do great, that’ll factor into your returns. If some companies go bankrupt, you’ll feel the pain, although it’ll be a small sting. While that’s a good strategy—and one that I employ in tax-advantaged accounts—it doesn’t account for the fact that with discipline, you can do better than the market. In fact, when it comes down to it, there’s no real way to invest while being passive about it. Even if your only choice is to buy shares in an index fund or stay in cash, you still have to make the decision. If you decide to avoid investing more because the market crashes, you’ll miss out on the next upswing. On the plus side, cash loses its value to inflation gradually over time, not immediately. Likewise, index investors putting money to work on a regular basis are likely to be buying at short-term tops at times. In today’s world, the push for automation in everything from the products we buy to the cars we own has reached into the world of passive investing as well. Using strategies like stop losses, for instance can save you some gains now, but at the expense of greater profits later. For example, say that you bought shares of Procter and Gamble (PG) back in 2003. Your approach was to buy and hold—and passively manage risk with a 20% trailing stop. Seems like the best of both worlds, doesn’t it? There’s the potential for capital gains, a moderate and growing dividend on the way up. You also have stop-loss that rises with the stock to ensure that, after the price goes up at least 20%, you’ll lock in some gains. This approach would have worked pretty well on a venerable consumer-staple play like P&G, whose low Beta of .53 meant that it should have only moved half as much as the markets. But then the 2008 wipeout happened.   On September 12th, 2008, the share price was $73.15. Less than 2 months later, on October 27th, the share price was at $57.27. That’s a 22% dip that would have gotten our theoretical investment stopped out at $58.86. To be fair, the passive investor would have probably been grateful, considering the state of the market at the time. But with the stop loss, that was it. They were out of the trade. There was no automated way to tell our passive investor to get back into the trade. They would have gotten back to breakeven—and even to a profit—had they just had the patience to sit through the crash! And if they did get back into the trade, they would have gotten stopped out again 2015 as shares took another steep dive in 2015. In the case of small cap stocks, which are the nursery for the next generation of mega-cap stocks, a periodic 20% correction is pretty commonplace, only to bounce to new highs that reward more patient investors. That’s something investors should expect in the space of a year. But for blue-chip stocks, it’s more infrequent, but it’s not impossible. Could you have taken this passive approach while investing in small caps like Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) in the 1960’s or Wal-Mart (WMT) in the 1970’s and still hold million-dollar positions in those blue-chips today? Nope, you would have been wiped out ages ago, a victim of your own passive investment style. Heck, you might have even sold at a loss! There’s no ideal way to deal with this rising automation. It’s programmed by the same people that make mistakes with their own money. Programmed trades likely made the 1987 crash bigger than it needed to be to bring valuations back in line. Ditto with the tech crash and housing bubble. The important thing is to keep an eye on what you own. And rather than look at a loss as a potential sale, first think about whether or not it’s an opportunity to buy more. Buying stocks in early 2009 was like buying filet mignon and lobster for $3 a pound at the store. It’s a rare opportunity, and one that doesn’t last forever. The market closed down in August and had a major decline last week. We could be in for some more turbulence. If you employ automation strategies like stop losses, it’s time to rethink whether they’re proving you with value, or hobbling your long-term returns. It’s also a good time to think about what you want to own next. Create a watch list of stocks you’d like to own at a price you think is fair.   Andrew Packer is a Senior Financial Editor with Newsmax Media.

Scott Spencer of Google and Stephan Loerke of the World Federation of Advertisers at DMEXCO 16 The 16 founding members and supporters include the American Association of Advertising Agencies (4As), Association of National Advertisers (ANA), BVDW Germany, Digital Content Next, DMA, European Publishers Council, Facebook, Google, GroupM, IAB, Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), News Media Alliance, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, The Washington Post, and World Federation of Advertisers (WFA) The coalition will create data-driven standards that can improve the online ad experience, and will deploy technology to implement those standards through the IAB Tech Lab. It will also use its leverage to promote wide adoption of its standards. “Our members recognize that there is room for improvement with the current consumer online advertising experience, as indicated in part by the emergence of ad blocking,” said Nancy Hill, president and CEO of the American Association of Advertising Agencies (4As), in the group’s founding announcement. “Now is the time for advertising professionals and marketers to look at ourselves to understand why consumers are not responding to these types of ads, and figure out how we can correct the issue to better engage with the consumers we’re trying to reach.” Speaking on a DMEXCO panel on ad-blocking, Scott Spencer, director of product management for coalition member Google, noted that consumers don’t think about whether the publisher or the advertiser is to blame for a poor ad experience, and that the problem impacts the entire ad ecosystem. Ad blockers aren’t the problem, Spencer continued; poor ad experiences are the problem. By studying what’s at the root of consumer frustration, the coalition can solve it so the entire industry can move forward. It’s essential to respect the consumer and address the source of ad annoyances. When the industry does that, he said, the reason to use ad blockers will go away.

By Tang See Kit, Channel NewsAsia Posted 16 Sep 2016 14:36 Updated 16 Sep 2016 14:40 Launched in September 2015, Indonesia-based Snapcart promises shoppers with small cash rebates when they upload their shopping receipts to the app. (Photo: Snapcart) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A SINGAPORE: Snap a picture of your shopping receipt, upload it to an app and you may receive a cash rebate of as much as 5 per cent of your total bill. It may sound too good to be true, but that is the business model of Indonesian startup Snapcart, which was launched last year. Touted as the first mobile app in Indonesia to have such a concept, the company started off by calculating cashback rewards based on selected products that fall under brands it is working with, but is now gearing up for a shift to offering rebates based on one’s total purchase.  According to the app’s founders, Mr Reynazran Royono and Ms Teresa Condicion, the average cash rewards range from 3.5 per cent to 5 per cent, and users can opt to receive them as top-up values for prepaid phones, online shopping vouchers or cash that is transferred directly their bank accounts. Apart from attracting shoppers that like a good deal, they said Snapcart also taps into the “second nature” of Asian consumers “who love taking photos with their smartphones”. Since its launch, the startup has had half a million downloads in its home market and boasts of a retention rate that is comparable with popular chat apps. “Well, we give away money and that’s why our users like us. We have a retention rate of up to 40 per cent after 30 days… a huge number that’s comparable with many chat apps and is quite an achievement I think,” said co-founder and CEO Royono, who was speaking to Channel NewsAsia on the sidelines of the inaugural Millennial 20/20 Summit held in Singapore last week. “WE’RE MORE THAN JUST A REWARDS APP” While the startup has made its name as one of the few platforms in the region that offers consumers cash back for their offline purchases, the founders pride themselves on being “more than just a rewards app”. In fact, Snapcart – a combination of “snap”, which is the verbalised form of “taking a snap”, and “cart” that stands for customer analytics and retail tracking – was founded with an aim to resolve the dearth of real-time insights on offline purchases in Southeast Asia. According to co-founder and COO Condicion, tracking offline commerce and consumer habits still largely involves “manual and tedious” methods such as door-to-door surveys. “When I was leading the market research team for the region at Procter & Gamble (P&G), we would take three to four weeks to collect these data by going door to door… by the time it’s collated, three to four months have passed and the data isn’t useful at all in helping me understand how my brands were doing,” explained Ms Condicion. With the painstakingly-collected data being outdated, they are rarely used by the sales and marketing team, Mr Royono, who started off his career in P&G’s Indonesia sales team, added. “We felt that frustration during our time in P&G and we thought that it’s time to provide some real-time analytics capability into the offline purchase world, which still makes up 98 per cent of the total purchase in this region,” he said. However, collecting offline commerce data in a fragmented market such as Indonesia is no walk in the park. “The ideal way is to integrate the point-of-sale systems across all the retailers but, the thing is, that is not going to happen. Systems are fragmented and retailers are secretive when it comes to their own data,” Mr Royono said. With shopping receipts usually containing a wealth of information about shoppers’ behaviours, the team eventually decided on incentivising shoppers to send in their receipts by offering small cash rewards. Frustrated by the lack of real-time data on offline purchases, Mr Reynazran Royono and Ms Teresa Condicion decided to address the issue. (Photo: Tang See Kit) Through the receipts gathered, its team of data scientists then analyses the raw data and turns them into real-time insights about consumer spending and shopping habits for brands. Said Ms Condicion: “The market research industry is a US$60 billion business and it remains dominated by companies that are still getting data from door-to-door surveys. Our model is to disrupt that and sell our data to brands who are spending millions on these less usable data. We want to help companies learn more about their shoppers and markets in a real-time manner.” Given the team’s background in the consumer goods industry and firsthand experience of the lack of real-time market research, Mr Royono noted that the startup has had quite a “smooth ride” thus far. “To be honest, there is no challenge. It’s been kind of a smooth ride (in terms) of support from investors and brands. I think it’s because of our credentials in the industry so it’s easier for us, compared to a fresh university graduate, to talk to brands within our networks and get their support even before we launched.” NEXT STEP: REGIONAL EXPANSION  Moving forward, Snapcart will continue working on its in-house technology to capture various forms of shopping receipts and has plans to eventually evolve into a “shopping assistant”. “Now that we know what you typically buy and how much you’ve been spending, we can help you organise your budget, help you recommend a shopping basket and where to go for best deals. These are definitely plans for the future,” said Ms Condicion. Geographical expansion across Southeast Asia is also on the cards, following its recent move into the Philippines. Other markets that are on the list include Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam, where information about offline purchases remain scarce. “We look at markets that have huge gaps when it comes to offline purchase data. Philippines is a market that’s really hard to understand because not all retailers share their data,” Mr Royono explained. “Their biggest retailer, SM Retail, is not sharing its data with the market research agencies so there’s a huge opportunity for us.” As such, Singapore, which is a smaller market compared to its bigger neighbours and where data is much easily accessed, is not on the priority list when it comes to Snapcart's potential new markets. But the founders have not ruled out a venture into Singapore, citing it as a valuable testbed for other developed markets such as Japan. “After Southeast Asia, we want to go into other parts of Asia and Singapore will be somewhere we’ll like to learn from before we go into similar developed markets such as Japan and Korea. We think it will involve a very different model and there will be much to learn from,” said Ms Condicion.

And another report Thursday said the company co-founded by Jessica Alba in 2011 could be bought by Unilever for over $1 billion. On Sept. 9, Recode cited anonymous sources who said Honest was in talks with global consumer products heavyweights, the likes of Procter & Gamble and Unilever. And a Thursday report in the Wall Street Journal cited unidentified “people familiar with the matter” to disclose that the British-Dutch consumer goods giant was in early talks to acquire the company. According to the Journal, the deal being discussed values Honest “at over $1 billion but significantly less than the $1.7 billion valuation that was placed on Honest in a fundraising round last year.” Related Stories Jessica Alba In Hot Water Over Laundry Detergent Jessica Alba’s The Honest Company Sued For Ineffective Products The Honest Company Inc. | FindTheCompany Honest, which promotes ethical consumerism and claims to avoid harsh chemicals in its products, has raised over $200 million since it was founded, of which $100 million was raised in 2015. The company sells diapers, hand sanitizers, cleaning and beauty products, mostly through its subscription website, primarily targeting young mothers. It generated revenues of about $300 million in 2015. Unilever, which sells a far wider variety of products in many parts of the world, is absent from some of the product categories in the United States that Honest has a presence in, such as diapers. In case the acquisition goes through, Unilever will also gain a foothold in the fast-growing “natural” or environment-friendly cleaning and beauty products. Honest may still choose to take the stock markets route and announce an initial public offering, sources told the Journal. The company has previously made clear its intention to go public, but has ostensibly held back given the weak performance of IPOs in the last few months.

And if all of the employees are already here, at least some for as long as six months, is it really new? Welcome to the curious case of battery maker and personal power company Duracell, which today announced it now has 65 people here, including Angelo Pantaleo as its CEO. But at least half of those in the new Chicago "executive offices" are IT folks, and they've been on the payroll since as far back as March 1, when Berkshire Hathaway, which acquired Duracell from Procter & Gamble, completed the process of establishing it as an independent company. As Crain's reported this morning, Mayor Rahm Emanuel jumped all over the news. I don't blame him—65 jobs is 65 jobs, and Emanuel has had great success wooing companies such as ConAgra, Motorola Mobility and McDonald's downtown. But the city's press release—typically rushed out overnight in a bid to grab a few seconds on morning TV—was a little incomplete. Duracell is using the phrase "executive offices" to describe the Chicago operation. A company representative said the headquarters would remain in Bethel, Conn. Most people recognize that a company's headquarters is the place where the CEO works. But when I questioned Pantaleo today, he said Duracell now is using a decentralized "new model" with four regional headquarters, one for North America in Bethel. Chicago "could be considered" the corporate center, he said, and anything involving the entire company will "go to Chicago." And the official corporate address will be here, too, he said. Pantaleo himself is a Chicagoan, a former executive at Marmon Holdings, also part of Berkshire Hathaway. On the other hand, at least half of the 65 folks here will be IT workers, other company spokesmen said. They'll replace IT workers who were based in Cincinnati at P&G. That means the corporate HQ here, if that's it, will be on the tiny size even as these things go. The IT folks will be at 135 S. LaSalle St., Panteleo et al. at 181 W. Madison St. Both Pantaleo and Emanuel praised Chicago's transportation, talent pool, quality of life and other factors. Still, the most important factor on corporate location decisions apparently remains where the CEO wants to live. In this case, it's Chicago.

GROWTH THROUGH ACQUISITION Jessica Alba's Honest Company Reportedly Considering a Sale to Unilever The consumer goods startup could be the next e-commerce company to sell for over $1 billion. By Lindsay Blakely Lindsay Blakely is the Los Angeles bureau chief for Inc. @lindsayblakely Los Angeles bureau chief, Inc.@lindsayblakely WRITE A COMMENT Honest Company co-founders Jessica Alba and Brian Lee. CREDIT: Advertisement For a while, the Honest Company was considered one of the most highly anticipated potential IPOs. In recent weeks, it's become the most highly anticipated potential acquisition target. The bottom line? Honest is considering all of its options. A news report from the Wall Street Journal Thursday citing "people familiar with the matter" suggests that Honest has been in talks to sell itself to Unilever. The Journal reports that the talks are early stage but could value a potential deal at over $1 billion --"significantly less" than Honest's previous valuation of $1.7 billion. This follows an earlier report from Recode suggesting Honest was talking to either Unilever or Procter & Gamble. Honest declined to comment on the reports. Last week, Unilever declined a request from Inc. to comment on the Recode story. Since the early days of the company, founder Jessica Alba and CEO Brian Lee have been very vocal about the potential for an Honest Company IPO. "We believe that ultimately this could be a great public story where so many in our community could be shareholders as well," Lee said onstage back in 2014 at Inc.'s GrowCo conference. "As an entrepreneur, if you're going to start something, if you're going to put in the effort, dream big." With a lackluster IPO market over the last year, it shouldn't be surprising that Honest is considering other avenues--particularly considering that in recent months, consumer product e-commerce companies racked up some big deals. Unilever picked up Dollar Shave Club in July for $1 billion and Walmart spent $3.3 billion buying e-commerce retailer Jet.com in August. The nearly five-year-old Honest Company will pull in a reported $250 million in sales in 2016 of its nontoxic baby, home, and personal care products. To date, the company has raised $222 million.

The consumer products company, co-founded by actress Jessica Alba, is in talks to sell, according to a report from recode.net. Sources told Recode the potential buyers could be consumer goods giants Unilever or Proctor & Gamble.   The company got its start by selling nontoxic, eco-friendly diapers and other baby products but has since expanded into a variety of categories including sunscreens, baby formula and makeup, also with a non-toxic slant.   Recode noted that a large chunk of its online sales comes from monthly subscription deliveries of product bundles, which has faced criticism from some customers who did not realize they were signing up for repeat deliveries and others who have argued it’s too difficult to cancel these repeat orders.   The company is also facing lawsuits that claim some Honest products, such as its detergent, contain chemicals that the company said it would avoid. Another lawsuit alleges that the brand’s sunscreen does not work as advertised. Honest has denied these claims.   The companies involved did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   Read the full Recode story here.

Google and P&G in Coalition to Police Ad Standards Across the Web By Emma Hall. Published on September 15, 2016. Reprints Reprints Google executive Sridhar Ramaswamy spoke at the Dmexco conference in Cologne, Germany, on Wednesday. Credit: Dmexco In possibly the broadest attempt yet to fix online advertising so that consumers don't become obsessed with blocking it, Google has got together with a diverse group of marketers, publishers, agencies and industry bodies to create The Coalition for Better Ads. Other participants include top global marketer Procter & Gamble, Unilever, The Washington Post, the 4As agency association, the Association of National Advertisers, the World Federation of Advertisers and GroupM, the world's largest ad buyer. The goal is to monitor the quality of ads using bespoke technology now in development at the Interactive Advertising Bureau's Tech Lab. Only ads that make it through the filter will be displayed on the websites of participating companies. Related Stories POLL: Why Is Adblock Plus Suddenly Selling Ads? In some ways the effort echoes the "Acceptable Ads" program run by Adblock Plus, under which the ad-blocking software lets certain ads through if it deems them unobtrusive and lightweight enough. Controversially, Adblock Plus charges large players in the ecosystem -- such as Google -- to participate. Under the Coalition for Better Ads plan, ads will be screened and scored according to a set of criteria that are expected to range from load time to creative execution. To help determine standards, the coalition will combine its members' expertise with information from consumers about the kind of online ads that they do and don't consume. In addition to the Washington Post, publishers and publishing bodies involved include Digital Context Next, the European Publishers Council and the News Media Alliance. The initiative was announced to coincide with the Dmexco conference in Cologne this week, with the scoring system expected to launch later this year. Google -- whose senior VP-ads and commercial, Sridhar Ramaswamy, has been speaking at Dmexco -- is taking an increasingly vocal stand against ad blocking. This week the internet giant ended its relationship with ComboTag, the ad buying platform that teamed up with AdBlock Plus to offer an ad exchange that served web ads to ad-blocking customers. "No industry has ever survived by ignoring consumer needs," said Jason Kint, CEO of Digital Content Next, in a statement. "DCN is looking forward to working with this coalition to address the underlying consumer needs that have accelerated ad blocking adoption." Ads funds the information, entertainment and services on much of the web, but ad sellers shouldn't abuse consumers, IAB President-CEO Randall Rothenberg said in a statement. "It is essential that industry create standards to assure that consumers get safe, fast, secure delivery of the sites and services they love." Ad blocking in the U.S. is set to grow 34% this year, taking nearly 70 million users – making up 26.3% of the market – out of the reaches of digital advertising, according to eMarketer. The number of ad blockers in the U.S. is expected to rise to 87 million in 2017. A global study by PageFair and Adobe showed year on year growth in ad blocking of 41% between the second quarter of 2014 and the second quarter of 2015. The report estimates that around the world $21.8 billion worth of ad revenues were blocked in 2015.

Here the world’s largest chemical park stretches out over ten square kilometres. Streets such as Chlor-, Ammoniak- and Methanolstrasse are shaded by 2,850 kilometres of pipes that connect everything like arteries; red is for steam, yellow for gas, green for water. The saying goes that most Westerners touch at least one product from a BASF site before leaving home. It is the world’s largest chemical company, and one of Europe’s largest manufacturers. Because it sells chemicals and chemical products to other companies, such as BMW, Nestle and Procter & Gamble, BASF is little known to consumers. It isn’t one for blowing its own trumpet. “We will try our best to remain spectacularly unspectacular for the media,” said Kurt Bock, the CEO, at last year’s 150th anniversary. But BASF repays attention for two reasons: the sheer impact of what it does, given its size, and its systematic approach to innovation. Big and bold The two go together. Mr Bock thinks size helps it make big bets on long-term innovation, which he calls an “increasingly lonely activity”. Last year the company spent nearly €2 billion ($2.2 billion) on R&D—its revenues last year were €70.4 billion—and devoted 10,000 employees to coming up with new ideas. It generated 1,000 patents, a typical number in any given year. BASF’s most celebrated breakthrough was its discovery in 1913 of a way to mass-produce fertiliser, which helped eliminate mass hunger. The real innovation of this “Haber-Bosch process”, named after the two scientists who won Nobel prizes for it, was not converting nitrogen and hydrogen into ammonia, but doing so on an industrial scale. Subsequent inventions have ranged from the tape in cassettes (1935) to an aroma called citronellal (1982) to drought-tolerant corn (2013). The new Adidas Boost, a running shoe that promises extra bounce using “energy capsules”, relies on a BASF invention. The firm’s next big bet is on electric cars. Some 200 metres from where Mr Bosch (of fertiliser fame) made his breakthrough, Marina Safont Sempere, a young chemist from Spain, is working on what could be another. Her team is working on next-generation battery materials. Today, she explains, electric cars typically contain 50 big, heavy batteries, which weigh them down, take up space and run out after 150km-200km. BASF hopes to create a powder that packs more energy into less space, weighs less and comes at a lower cost. Such investments are partly a bet on the future, partly a hedge on current revenues tied to the combustion engine. One tested strategy for BASF is trying to anticipate exactly how future markets will develop. As the middle classes grow, for example, sales of dishwashers and dishwasher tablets are booming. But phosphate, which removes scale, will be banned in the EU from January. Scientists at BASF started thinking about this over 20 years ago and worked on Trilon M, a chemical that performs as well as phosphate but is biodegradable. Its approach is founded on an extensive network. It works with 600 universities, research institutes and companies, and has its own venture-capital outfit. It seeks out joint ventures and makes small strategic acquisitions, such as the recent purchase of Verenium ($62m), an enzyme-research company. It also increasingly works in partnership with customers, as an inventor-for-hire, on whatever they need (non-sticky sunscreen, carbon-free packaging, lighter cars), marking an expansion to downstream and service provision. Some of BASF’s customers increasingly request help to meet their environmental goals, although the company acknowledges that there are many clients for whom this is a much lower priority. It is a dilemma for the chemicals industry whether or not to shift more quickly to sustainable production than clients actually demand. The firm claims that by now, 27% of its products contribute in some way to “sustainability”, a figure that it wants to increase. Its Verbund principle, a system whereby it recycles waste products—for example, by selling excess carbon to the beverage industry—is good for profits. It saves some €1 billion a year from such processes. Another feature is BASF’s habit of quickly shedding businesses when new iterations no longer pay off. This happened in the textile-chemicals business, and in parts of the paper-chemicals industry, when customers told it that there was no need for further product refinements. Similarly, it got out of fertilisers, caffeine and standard plastics because they all became too commoditised, making it hard to compete. Steady as she goes Discipline has some drawbacks. Stockmarket analysts like BASF’s vertically-integrated structure—it owns most of its supply chain—and its strong focus on innovation. Its share price has risen over the past decade. But the firm’s methodical approach to acquisitions could also work against it. On September 14th Monsanto, the world’s biggest seed producer, accepted a takeover by Bayer, a German drugs and chemicals giant, worth $66 billion (€59 billion). Amid a wave of consolidation in the agribusiness industry, says Lutz Grueten of Commerzbank, BASF could be left behind because it does not possess its own seeds business and has instead relied on partnerships, including with Monsanto. It is unclear whether this contract will be renewed. BASF emphasises that it is serious about its crop-protection business, that it has €6 billion in sales and that it devotes 26% of its R&D to agribusiness. The firm will be on the lookout for anything coming onto the market as a consequence of the Bayer-Monsanto deal. Another worry for Mr Bock is a zeal for regulation on the part of European governments. The continent’s approach to scientific testing is becoming too cautious compared to that of America, he reckons. A current debate over research on, and use of, endocrine-disrupting chemicals (substances that can have harmful effects on the body’s hormone system) is one example. But Mr Bock is optimistic about his industry’s ability to help solve mankind’s problems as a silent enabler of progress. He apologises for sounding pompous, but promises that “if you want to improve the state of the world, chemistry can really help.” twitter icon facebook icon more iconMore linkedin icon googleplus icon mail icon print icon purchase-rights icon View comments (4) Editors’ picks Trump’s worldThe new nationalism With his call to put “America First”, Donald Trump is the latest recruit to a dangerous nationalism The Trump administrationHardline and nativist Who is Chinese?The upper Han Germany and BritainDivided by a common union close icon Daily WatchWord of the day: assuage film icon Latest Updates Daily chartWhat the world thinks about globalisation Graphic detail The unravellingA Western-backed deal to salvage Libya is falling apart Middle East and Africa The week aheadNationalism goes international International No ideologue?Donald Trump chooses Jeff Sessions for attorney-general Democracy in America The Economist asksIs Canada’s liberalism a model for the world?

Richard Lauf, chairman of the council’s board of directors and a retiree, will present “Brexit: a Warning Shot Against Globalization” from 9 a.m. to 10:15 a.m. Sunday, Oct. 2, at Indian Hill Church, 6000 Drake Road. “Globalization is a phenomenon that has remade the economy of virtually every nation, reshaped almost every industry and touched billions of lives, often in surprising and ambiguous ways,” said forum organizer Gerri Strauss, a member of Indian Hill Church. “It is meant to signify integration and unity, yet it has proved – in its way – to be no less polarizing than the Cold War divisions it has supplanted. “Come and join us at Indian Hill Church as we try to untangle the importance of various aspects of globalization,” Strauss said. Strauss said the church is pleased that Lauf has agreed to lead a forum about the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union. “(Lauf) had a long career at Procter & Gamble, where he worked on such international projects as restructuring their European manufacturing and distribution as the EU borders opened, dealing with the Venezuela hyperinflation and integrating the Richardson-Vicks acquisition into P&G Mexico,” Strauss said. Three more globalization forums will begin at 9 a.m. on successive Sundays at Indian Hill Church. All of the forums are free and open to the public. •Oct. 9 – Joe Dehner, a lawyer with Frost Brown Todd of downtown Cincinnati, will present “Free trade agreements: the pros and cons.” Dehner has chaired Frost Brown Todd’s International Services Group for more than 20 years. •Oct. 16 - Allison Herre and Daniel Sarell of Catholic Charities Southwestern Ohio will present “Understanding a migrant’s journey.” Herre is director of Legal Immigration Services at Catholic Charities Southwestern Ohio. An immigration attorney, she helps families and represents children from Central America who are facing deportation. Sarell is director of Mission Advancement at Catholic Charities Southwestern Ohio. He has more than 20 years’ experience in Catholic parish and diocesan ministry. •Oct. 23 - Mary (Peggy) Shukairy, a lawyer with Frost Brown Todd, will present “World Migration in the Age of Globalization.” She practices immigration law and helps people get immigrant and non-immigrant employment-based visas.

Have you been orphaned like Annie as your company moves to more attractive opportunities? Take comfort; there is someone out there who loves you and would like to market you back to life. Prestige Brands (PBH) is a consumer product company specializing in acquiring brands left behind by others. Formed in 1996, Prestige has assembled an amazing array of familiar products — all acquired at discount prices due to their having lost favor for one reason or another within their parent company. Among the products being manufactured and distributed by Prestige are over the counter drugs, cleaning products and personal care items. Recognizable names include Chloraseptic, Murine, Clear Eyes, Comet, Compound W, Cutex, Demorex and Spic & Span. These, and numerous other products, have been acquired from major home product companies such as Proctor and Gamble. The most recent label acquired was in the over-the-counter pharmaceutical area whose primary products revolve around wart removal. Prestige company stock has traded in a relatively narrow range during the last year. The 52-week high for the stock is $12.29, and the low for the period is $5.87. The company recently had its credit rating affirmed with a negative outlook. Company executives are expressing confidence that Prestige can resume its core growth rate in 2009 after experiencing a drop in revenues exclusive of its recent acquisition of the Compound W line of wart removal and related products. While these consumer products are all highly recognizable names with high levels of customer satisfaction, they are also in many cases discretionary items which are candidates for consumer belt tightening. As a result, many analysts have rated the company’s stock a sell, or at best, a hold. Prestige does not have a great deal of long-term debt outstanding. Their most actively traded offering carries a 9.25% coupon and most recently traded at 93.65, producing a yield to maturity of 11.536%. Yield to the par call in 2010 at this price would be 14.445% While these yields are attractive and tempting, it does not appear that the investor is being fairly compensated at these levels for the risk being undertaken. An investor in this sector might want to wait until the price declines further before taking this leap. Should adding this bond to the portfolio be desired by the investor, the percentage allocation to the name should be minor.

Index heavyweight and cigarette major ITC rose 2.06% to Rs 257.20 after the company's chief operating officer (COO) Sanjiv Puri was quoted as saying that the firm's consumer goods business presents the maximum potential for value creation. The company reportedly aims to strengthen its footprints in the FMCG sector by bringing in innovative, differentiated and first time products to the market, Puri added. ITC expects to ramp up revenue from branded packaged foods and personal care products to Rs 1 lakh crore by 2030. GMR Infrastructure fell 2.47% to Rs 14.20 after the company reported net loss of Rs 123.06 crore in Q1 June 2016 higher than net loss of Rs 1.33 crore in Q1 June 2015.

Yes Bank edged lower on reports that Securities & Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is looking into discrepancies in the bank's planned qualified institutional placement (QIP) of shares. The stock fell 2.51% to Rs 1,221.95. According to reports, the stock market regulator Sebi is looking into Yes Bank's notices to stock exchanges about the planned QIP of shares, the surge in the stock in the run-up to the issue date and its intra-day fall before the announcement to call off the issue. Sebi is reportedly looking into why investment bankers failed to take note of the fact that there was no pre-intimation by Yes Bank to stock exchanges that there would be a board meeting. It may be recalled that Yes Bank had announced on 8 September 2016 its decision to defer QIP of shares citing extreme volatility during trading day on 8 September 2016 because of misinterpretation of new QIP guidelines. The bank had on 7 September 2016 announced opening of QIP of equity shares of face value Rs 10 each to raise up to $1 billion. Yes Bank had fixed Rs 1,371.84 per share as the floor price at that time. Realty shares were mixed.

Total income rose 26.94% to Rs 495.93 crore in Q1 June 2016 over Q1 June 2015. The company's consolidated net debt as of 30 June 2016 stood at Rs 5265 crore.

The company delivered 2.35 million square feet of completed property during Q1 June 2016. The result was announced after market hours yesterday, 14 September 2016. BEML fell 11.49% to Rs 908.05 after the company reported net loss of Rs 107.10 crore in Q1 June 2016, higher than net loss of Rs 68.10 crore in Q1 June 2015. Total income fell 49.7% to Rs 300.52 crore in Q1 June 2016 over Q1 June 2015. The result was announced after market hours yesterday, 14 September 2016. CESC was up 0.21% to Rs 656.50. Media reports suggested that a foreign brokerage has maintained its buy rating on the stock. The foreign brokerage has reportedly said that CESC is a play on power reforms. Chandrapur plant load factor (PLF) improvement is a key positive for the company, the brokerage added. CESC's net profit rose 0.6% to Rs 174 crore on 11.8% growth in net sales to Rs 1888 crore in Q1 June 2016 over Q1 June 2015. The result was announced during market hours yesterday, 14 September 2016. In overseas stock markets, Asian stocks were mixed as investors grappled with the seemingly diminishing ability of major central banks to stimulate growth, while a tumble in crude oil inflamed already heightened risk aversion. In US, the Dow industrials and the S&P 500 closed in negative territory yesterday, 14 September 2016, in the wake of slumping crude-oil prices, erasing earlier gains for the major benchmarks, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq bucked the losing trend.

Two months after acquiring Dollar Shave Club for about $1 billion, Unilever is reportedly in talks to buy Jessica Alba's Honest Co. for a similar amount. Like Dollar Shave, Honest is a popular consumer brand that's taken advantage of modern internet marketing and distribution tools to compete with industry giants. The Wall Street Journal, citing a person familiar with the matter, reported Thursday night that talks between Unilever and Honest are at an early stage and that Honest "hasn't ruled out going for an initial public offering instead." A Unilever spokesperson declined to comment, and a representative from Honest didn't respond to a request for comment. While not providing the level of gains that VCs generate from massive Facebook and Google acquisitions or from blockbuster IPOs, Unilever is at least offering some healthy liquidity to investors and proving venture-backed start-ups can succeed in penetrating markets outside of technology. The dealmaking is particularly good news for investors in consumer packaged goods, where big acquirers have yet to materialize. In retail, Wal-Mart recently shelled out $3.3 billion for Jet.com and Nordstrom previously purchased HauteLook and Trunk Club, but there's been virtually no activity in the market for packaged foods, beverages and household goods. show chapters <p>Dollar Shave Club&#039;s top investor on $1B deal</p> <p>Unilever bought the Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion. One of the shave club&#039;s largest investors David Pakman, Venrock venture capitalist, discusses the deal. </p> Dollar Shave Club's top investor on $1B deal    Wednesday, 20 Jul 2016 | 1:46 PM ET | 03:28 "Unilever is stepping up now and becoming potentially that innovative leader that looks at acquisitions of these new companies as a strategy for growing, modernizing the brand and taking products to new demographics," said Josh Goldman, a partner at Norwest Venture Partners and an investor in e-commerce companies including Casper, ModCloth and Gilt Groupe. "They've got a line of VCs lining up to talk to them now." Honest is based in Santa Monica, California, just a few miles from Dollar Shave. Alba, who starred in films including "Little Fockers" and "Fantastic Four," started the company in 2011, and has gained traction through online sales of diapers, organic baby formula, laundry detergent and dish soap. Headquartered more than 5,000 miles away in London, Unilever is the world's fourth-largest fast-moving consumer goods company, according to OC&C Strategy Consultants. The top three are Nestle, Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo. As Unilever expands its brand, don't expect it to be entirely friendly to start-ups and Silicon Valley. In 2014, the maker of Hellmann's mayonnaise sued start-up food company Hampton Creek, claiming that its Just Mayo product was engaging in false advertising because it wasn't real mayonnaise. Hellmann's later dropped the suit, but turned around earlier this year and introduced competitive eggless products. Of course, San Francisco-based Hampton Creek now has bigger problems, after Bloomberg reported last month that the company bought its own products from stores across the country. The U.S. Justice Department subsequently opened a criminal probe into whether the company committed fraud. Unilever shares Even if Unilever ends up buying Honest for $1 billion or something close to it, some investors will be disappointed. In August 2015, the company was valued at $1.7 billion in a funding round led by Glade Brook Capital Partners. In total, the company has raised more than $220 million. Still, any billion-dollar acquisition lifts optimism among venture capitalists. After all, Twilio is the only venture-backed U.S. tech company to go public in 2016, and the IPO market is headed for its worst year since the depths of the financial crisis. And for investors concerned that Amazon.com is becoming the one-stop shop for all retail and consumer goods, an aggressive Unilever represents some hope. "Many investors shy away from commerce companies," wrote David Pakman, a partner at venture firm Venrock, in a blog post after Dollar Shave — one of his investments — was acquired. "The multiples tend to be low, Amazon is ever-present, and lots of capital can be required to scale. To us, we didn't see DSC as an e-commerce company, but instead as a model for new full-stack consumer products companies."

It's been a decade of Sundays in Press-Gazette Richard Ryman , USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin 11:40 a.m. CDT September 16, 2016 Buy Photo Richard Ryman (Photo: File/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)Buy Photo Today marks my 520th consecutive Sunday in the Press-Gazette. That's 10 years without a break, through vacations, unpaid furloughs and one nasty kidney stone. My business column appeared 519 of those Sundays (did I mention that kidney stone) and a lot of stories were mixed in as well. The streak will continue for a while, I think, but with fewer columns on my part. I am on vacation this week and for the first time in 10 years did not write two (or three) columns before I left. Instead, Jeff Bollier and I will share the Sunday business column duties. Jeff is our primary business writer who joined the Press-Gazette last year after I assumed the Packers business reporter role. I will continue writing columns on mostly alternating Sundays and provide a lot of Sunday Packers business stories, as well. If you have suggestions for business stories, contact Jeff at jbollier@gannett.com or me at rryman@gannett.com. We have adjoining desks and talk about business coverage daily, so sending information to either of us works. Fabio Perini's 50th Tissue- and towel-equipment maker Fabio Perini is celebrating its 50th anniversary. Fabio Perini, based in Lucca, Italy, established its North American headquarters in 1978 in Ashwaubenon. Two years later, it moved to an old firehouse on Cormier Road and in 1986 was the first company to locate in the Ashwaubenon Industrial Park, where it has a 50,000-square foot building at 3060 S. Ridge Road. It plans a two-week open house for customers and vendors beginning Monday. Among those customers are Procter & Gamble, Georgia-Pacific, Kimberly-Clark and the like. Super Bowl season in pictures Daniel Kramer, son of legendary guard Jerry Kramer, produced a coffee-table photo book of the 1996-97 Super Bowl XXXI season. A journalist and photographer, Kramer took photos throughout that year of players and Packers alumni. "Return To Glory" is a 139-page coffee table book with 104 photos and memories of the season by key figures, including Mike Holmgren, Ron Wolf, LeRoy Butler and others. Kramer and his dad are scheduled to do a book signing from 1 to 2:30 p.m. Sept. 24 in the Packers Pro Shop at Lambeau Field. Daniel Kramer, a graduate of Green Bay Southwest High School, the University of Minnesota and the Academy of Art University in San Francisco, originally took photos for Dick Schaap's book "Green Bay Replay," but only a handful were used. Kramer decided he had plenty more good photos and published "Return to Glory" himself, funding it with a Kickstarter campaign. Vitamin Boost reboots Vitamin Boost & Weight Loss Center's opening got off to a rocky start when a key employee left at the last minute. Since then, the business at 141 Siegler St., Suite 102, Green Bay has got it sorted out and is launching again. Vitamin Boost provides vitamin B12, C and D3 shots and Super Lipotropics with L-Caritine. Hours are noon to 6:30 p.m. Tuesdays and Thursdays; 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays.

GOODMAN-HUGHEY via ESPN Sep 16, 2016, 12:20 PM ET 0 Shares Email Star 0 Shares Email U.S. gymnastics superstar Simone Biles may have five Olympic medals swinging from her neck, but it's her mother Nellie Biles, who feels like the ultimate champion. "Simone's road to Rio was such an amazing journey for our whole family. I'm just so thankful," noted Mrs. Biles. You see, Simone's accomplishments are rooted in her mother's ability to create a "village" (a tight-knit community of family and friends) that supports her daughter through ups, downs and everything in between. For instance, the extended Biles family does a weekly family dinner, attends church together -- and all flew out to Rio to see Simone shine at the Olympics. Trout happy to see hard work pay off with MVP MVP just the beginning for Bryant Conley calls Gasol's dance the 'Spanish McGregor walk' Lightning still a playoff team without Stamkos sc Nellie, who adopted 19-year-old Simone and her 17-year-old sister Adria when they were small children, along with her husband Ron (Simone and Adria's biological grandfather), wants her kids to know and understand they are unconditionally loved -- and that's part of the Biles magic. ?? Last week, while Simone was on a media blitz, hitting "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" and "Good Morning America," Mrs. Biles sat down with espnW from her hotel room in midtown Manhattan to discuss her commitment to family and how she keeps her daughter steady on the balance beam of life. espnW: At what point did you know you Simone was a gifted athlete? Biles: From the start she absolutely loved gymnastics. I always supported her, but I never thought much of it. It wasn't until 2012, when Simone won her first all-around [at the American Classic in Huntsville, Texas], that I really started to believe... wow, my daughter really gets this sport. The following year she was a senior in high school, and had turned 16 years old. So, a lot of things were evolving in her life. Simone started having problems with concentration and her focus was off, and as a result her performance was a bit rough at the Secret U.S. Classic. After that competition, we talked to a sports psychologist, which helped her regain focus. I believe her talking to those two therapists was really key.?She then went on to win the women's individual all-around at the [2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championship in Antwerp, Belgium]. Once that happened, I knew we were headed to greater times. I always knew she could physically do it. She was capable, it was her mental status that needed to be aligned. And it all worked out. espnW: Your daughter Adria is a gymnast as well. How do you help create a sense of work/personal life balance for she and Simone? Biles: I think it's important that we function as a family. Not only for my two girls, but for Simone's brothers, too; because I have four children. The boys are grown and live on their own. But, they still come to the house and visit quite frequently. But, in particular Simone and Adria normally train all week except Sunday. So there's no real break. However, on Saturday, they start at 9 a.m. and end at 1 p.m. Because that's an early end day, the girls often use that afternoon to get their nails or hair done. However, during the week, they are balancing school work and gymnastics, and that pretty much takes up their time. Then Sunday is family day, so we always go to church together. And I normally leave it up to the girls to decide what we are having for Sunday dinner, and they will argue about what they want, but they eventually come to some sort of consensus. The boys come over in the evening time, and we just enjoy each other's company. espnW: What was your most memorable moment in Rio? Biles: There are a few for me. But, just celebrating all of Simone's accomplishments was just so special. We didn't get a chance to see her that often, because Simone was in the Olympic village, and we were in a hotel. We brought a group of 17 family members and friends to Rio with us, just to support her. So having such a huge amount of support in general, was quite memorable.? Each time we came back from competition, we'd all sit down and celebrate as a group. We wanted to recall and discuss what we had just witnessed, and it was just so special to share those moments with friends and family. We all got together about six or seven times during the Olympics and it was simply amazing, after each competition, we all shared that experience together. Though, there was one particular moment that truly stuck out to me. It was when we first saw Simone, which was when the U.S. won gold in team competition, she along with the other gymnasts came around to our hotel. It was a big celebration for all of the athletes and families, and that was an amazing experience for us all. espnW: What goes through your mind when Simone is in competition? Biles: I am absolutely a basket case during competition. Whenever we go to the meets, my family knows not to talk to me. I'm in my own space. I don't want any comments. I don't want anyone to say anything to me until it's over. Now depending on how nervous I get, I'll squeeze my husband's hand or Adria's hand. I may look calm, but I'm not! I'm [a] total wreck until it's over. I cannot eat or drink the entire day leading up to the competition. I'm sure partnership proposals are flooding your inbox post-Olympics, why did you think the "My Black is Beautiful" and Tide's "Small but Powerful" campaigns were a good fit for you and Simone? Biles: The Tide PODS concept alone. My daughter is small in stature, but she's incredibly powerful. The fact that they made that analogy between the PODS and Simone, was just so fitting. Also, Proctor & Gamble's "My Black is Beautiful" campaign (which features P&G products that caters to an African-American female demographic) -- the goal of it is to promote women feeling comfortable in their own skin. The message is about black women empowering themselves, and embracing themselves both inside and out. And that's a very important platform for my daughter and me. espnW: You and your husband Ron opened World Champions Centre in Spring, Texas, where Simone trains. Do you think the gym was part of her ultimate success? Biles: So, after the world's completion in 2013, Simone's then trainer Aimee Boorman wanted to discuss finding a new gym. But, I didn't think that was a good idea. I didn't want my daughter bouncing from gym to gym. However, that made me think ... maybe, we should build our own gym, which we did in 2014. Simone started training there right away (it opened to the public in May 2016). Overall, building the gym was one of the best things I've ever done. It gave her a comfortable place to train, and I would say for the last year, while training for the Olympics, it really helped. She was really grateful to have somewhere to train that was state of the art, with new equipment and she had everything she needed right there. Plus, it's a great place for other gymnasts as well. So, it's a service to the community. We also have practice space for things like Taekwondo or just tumbling. There's some variety in that gym. We even have a classroom on site, so that the athletes can go to school while training. espnW: Speaking of Aimee Boorman, as of August 2016, she is no longer training your daughter. How is Simone dealing with the change? Biles: Aimee and I had an initial conversation about that. From our chat, I got the impression that she had other opportunities coming her way, and that's wonderful for her. It's great that she took advantage. Simply because there's no more Simone in that gym. Simone is off doing her own thing, so it's good that Aimee decided to pursue her dreams as well. Initially, Simone had a little difficulty with it, but she understands and embraces the idea. I do not know what [Simone] is going to do in respect to training going forward and she doesn't either. But, she'll figure it out when she gets back to Texas. We'll cross that bridge when she's back home.? Ericka N. Goodman-Hughey is a senior editor at espnW.

Jessica Alba is in talks to sell her diaper and household goods company — although the actress may be a bit disappointed at how much her Honest Co. is worth. The five-year-old company, which was valued at $1.7 billion after a capital raise last year, is in talks to sell itself to consumer products giants Unilever for just over $1 billion, according to a report Friday. The 35-year-old brunette explored an IPO earlier this year, and may still decide to go that route if the early-stage negotiations with Unilever — whose vast products stable includes Hellman’s mayonnaise, Dove soap, Lipton tea and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream — fall through, according to the Wall Street Journal, which reported on the talks and the price range. Last week, a report by Recode had Alba talking with a big consumer package company on a deal. It said the talks were likely with Unilever or Procter & Gamble. Honest, which sells more than 100 nontoxic products like diapers, toiletries, baby formula and household cleaners, has raised $222 million altogether, $100 million of which came in just last year. Sold in over 700 stores, including Whole Foods, Costco and Nordstrom, Honest’s products are also sold via monthly subscriptions. Alba faced a barrage of negative press and lawsuits over the ingredients in some of her products — allegations that they are not as wholesome as advertised — and that her company’s sunscreen product is ineffective. Honest has denied those allegations.

The global hair and body mist market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 7.92% during the period 2016-2020. Commenting on the report, an analyst from the research team said: Growth in sales of men's hair care products will be a key trend for market growth. The global hair care market has a significant impact on the global hair mist market, as hair mist falls under the subcategory of hair styling products which accounted for 16.5% of the $81.16 billion hair care market in 2015. Though the global hair care market is largely dominated by the women's category of hair care products, the higher like-for-like growth opportunity came from the men's category during the period 2010-2015. The men's hair care sales grew by an AAGR close to 6% during the historical periods whereas the women's segment increased by an AAGR close to 3% during the same period. The major demand in the men's category is coming from the hair colorants and hair styling products, accounting for close to 50% of the men's hair care revenue. According to the report, one of the key drivers for market growth will be growing channels for product distribution. Considering factors such as convenience and easy on-the-go shopping experiences, consumers are now increasingly purchasing beauty products online. To fulfil consumer requirements, a growing number of beauty marketers are embracing the online platform. Beauty marketers are also increasingly adopting an omni-channel strategy. In the wake of prevailing competition, beauty marketers are integrating their online and offline operations to provide hassle-free shopping experience to consumers. In 2015, the online sales of L'Oréal amounted to $1.44 billion, contributing 8.2% of the company's consolidated sales.

Businesses are shifting focus from mass-manufactured, mass-marketed products to an immersive market of custom services and digital experiences. Rich HillebrechtThe new service economy is dominated by digital services that are made-to-order for customers, where the quality of the experience – including intuitive ease, convenience, and richness of choice – is a key differentiator. Understanding customers is at the centre of the 'digital transformation'. CIOs and CMOs must work together to orchestrate digital experiences that engage each customer with a rich array of choices that can make their lives easier or better. Role of CX within digital transformation When it comes to customer experience, it’s not just about understanding its importance for the business, but about comprehending how the experience itself is evolving and what a successful service relationship looks like from the customers’ point of view. With more and more people choosing to purchase products and services via smartphones, tablets, PCs, laptops and even wearable devices, customers within the commercial and consumer space have more choices and means of opting in or out of a product or service offering than ever before. Before reaching out to a company, consumers typically do most of their initial research on their own. Advertisement As a result, marketing needs to reach out to consumers across all devices to create a seamless digital experience. Whilst progress is being made, Forrester still estimates 46% of marketing leaders and 51% of technology management leaders have a single view of the customer across all touchpoints. That being said, more organisations are adopting a digital first strategy, recognising they need to reach the customer across their digital journey. By embracing technology across the business, companies like Starbucks, Proctor & Gamble, Airbnb and Uber offer customers more options and greater convenience at lower costs. ©kantver via 123RF It’s not just about marketing As businesses continue to go digital, the entire organisation must have a digital mind-set. In particular, CMOs and CIOs must work together on digital initiatives. Digital technologies have reinvigorated the CMO’s role as a driver of growth. Big data, social media, and the cloud have drastically changed the consumer landscape as marketing technology is becoming increasingly popular. With IT organisations having much deeper experience in digital technologies, a tight alliance between CMOs and CIOs is a must. There is a strong need to seamlessly link digital marketing efforts to the enterprise systems that enable customer relationship management in order to deliver great customer experiences and drive measurable results for the business. Working together to improve customer focus Marketing may work the magic behind the success of digital services, but that magic itself depends on the support of the right technologies. However, aligning the needs and expectations of the business and IT’s ability to deliver is easier said than done. The Riverbed Global Application Performance Survey 2015 revealed while 98% of executives believe that enterprise application performance is critical to achieving optimal business performance, 89% say poor performance of enterprise applications negatively impacts their productivity on a regular basis. All teams must now become more tech-savvy. New technologies are making it easier to bridge the gap between the business the IT and specifically between CIOs and CMOs. New tools allow detailed analytics to be run, and subsequently acted upon. It provides the C-suite with vital information which steers business decisions. By coming together to make technology-based marketing magic, CIOs and CMOs can consolidate ideas and learn more about their consumer base. The targeted approach this creates is key to ultimately fulfilling the potential of digital transformation. ‹    Like Save Email Print PDF Advertisement About the author Rich Hillebrecht, Chief Information Officer, Riverbed Technology Comment on thisComment Comment guidelines and disclaimer LEGAL DISCLAIMER: This Message Board accepts no liability of legal consequences that arise from the Message Boards (e.g. defamation, slander, or other such crimes).

The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter it didn’t name, that Unilever is discussing a deal above $1 billion but much lower than the startup’s previous valuation of $1.7 billion. Honest Co. has raised $200 million from investors including General Catalyst Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Fidelity since it was set up in 2011. It generates about $300 million in annual revenue, and sells both through retailers such as Target and via its own website. Any deal with Honest Co. will be the second for Unilever after it purchased Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion deal in one of the largest e-commerce acquisitions in recent months. In another deal recently, Walmart acquired e-commerce company Jet.com for $3.3 billion. Tech news provider Re/code had first reported that The Honest Company was in talks with consumer good conglomerates such as Procter & Gamble and Unilever. Honest Co. is led by CEO Brian Lee, a serial entrepreneur who most recently ran online shoe retailer ShoeDazzle. The company started by selling non-toxic, eco-friendly diapers and other baby products but has since expanded into a variety of categories including sunscreens, baby formula and makeup. Earlier this year, the company was hit with several lawsuits claiming its products contain chemicals it says it avoids. Alba has called the lawsuits “baseless” and aimed at her company because it’s an “easy target”. Like this report? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our top reports.

By Serena Ng Published: Sept 15, 2016 7:40 p.m. ET Share By SerenaNg Unilever PLC is in talks to acquire Honest Co., the consumer-products retailer co-founded by actress Jessica Alba, according to people familiar with the matter. Unilever, maker of Dove soaps and Axe body sprays, is discussing a deal valued at over $1 billion but significantly less than the $1.7 billion valuation that was placed on Honest in a fundraising round last year, the people said. The talks are at an early stage, and Honest hasn't ruled out pursuing an initial public offering instead, one of the people said. Honest has raised more than $200 million from outside investors since the Santa Monica, Calif., company's founding in 2011, according to FactSet data. Those investors include venture-capital firms General Catalyst Partners and Lightspeed Venture Partners as well as money managers Fidelity Management & Research Co. and Wellington Management Co. In the event of a sale, Honest has pledged to pay some investors double their investment. The company, which said it had revenue of $170 million in 2014, sells disposable baby diapers, household cleaners, personal-care and beauty products and has built a loyal following among young mothers. Many consumers buy directly from its website via monthly subscription services. Some items are also sold at brick-and-mortar retailers including Target Corp. and Whole Foods Markets Inc. Acquiring Honest would give Unilever a foothold in the fast-growing market for "natural" or "green" cleaning products, as well as the diaper business. Honest's business model could give Unilever more insight into shopper behavior, but risks alienating traditional retailers that carry its goods. Unilever sells packaged food, household and personal-care products globally, but in the U.S. it doesn't compete with Honest in many product categories. It sold its North American laundry detergent business for $1.45 billion to a private-equity firm in 2008, and in recent years has expanded in U.S. hair- and skin-care products Honest has challenged giants such as Procter & Gamble Co. and Clorox Co. with promises to avoid harsh chemicals found in many mainstream products. However, a Wall Street Journal investigation earlier this year found Honest's laundry detergent contained sodium lauryl sulfate, or SLS, one of the ingredients it pledged to avoid. Honest disputed the findings of two independent lab tests and said its own testing didn't find SLS. For Unilever, an acquisition of Honest would be its second recent purchase of a California e-commerce consumer products company. In August, it paid $1 billion to acquire Dollar Shave Club, a premium to the $615 million valuation that company fetched a year earlier. The fast-growing but unprofitable startup provides a mail-order service that ships disposable razors for a flat monthly fee.

Norma Petersen, tireless champion of the arts Janelle Gelfand , jgelfand@enquirer.com 4:20 p.m. EDT September 15, 2016 She helped Erich Kunzel spearhead a new School for Creative and Performing Arts Buy Photo Norma Petersen (Photo: Enquirer file)Buy Photo Norma Petersen sold symphony tickets, directed volunteers, helped to found a support group for Music Hall, turned around a struggling Cincinnati Chamber Orchestra and worked with Cincinnati Pops conductor Erich Kunzel to create a new School for Creative and Performing Arts. Yet, despite her tireless volunteerism and passion for the arts, she was home in time to cook dinner each night for her six children. “She was home when we came home,” said her son, Steven Petersen. “We sat down to dinner every night as a family, always. There were eight of us around the table, and she could stretch a chicken like nobody else.” Mrs. Petersen died on Sept. 9 at Hyde Park Health Center, surrounded by her family. She was 88. The Cincinnati Pops will dedicate its season opening concerts this weekend to Mrs. Petersen’s memory. She was an ardent supporter of the Cincinnati Symphony and Pops Orchestra, and longtime friend of Kunzel, who died in 2009. The Pops conductor asked her to help him spearhead the unprecedented K-12 arts school near Music Hall in Over-the-Rhine, SCPA, part of Cincinnati Public Schools. She served as executive director of the Greater Cincinnati Arts and Education Center, which saw the project to completion. At its opening in 2010, she was thanked for 20 years of work with Kunzel to make his dream come true. “They were buddies, there’s no question,” said Steven Petersen. “Erich called her ‘Mother,’ which was more of an endearment. That was how he felt about her, that she was watching over everything and keeping an eye on things and caring and nurturing.” Buy Photo Norma Petersen, longtime friend and supporter of Erich Kunzel, near a portrait of the legendary Cincinnati Pops Orchestra, in 2009.  (Photo: Enquirer file/MIchael E. Keating) Caring and nurturing was also how Mrs. Petersen felt about the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. When she was vice president of subscription sales in 1974-75 for the legendary Women’s Committee, a volunteer arm, subscription sales skyrocketed from 11,000 to 17,000. As its president (1977-79), she presided over projects such as the vastly successful Septemberfest – the predecessor of Riverfest. In 1981, then-CSO president Steven Monder hired her to be the orchestra's director of volunteers, a position she held for six years. At the time, the organization was introducing for the first time computerized ticket sales and fundraising, and the role of volunteers was changing. She was a part of a large, nationwide transition among orchestras, helping to shepherd the old-school kind of volunteerism into the newer era, Monder said. “Norma found the good in everything, and helped enormously,” Monder said. “She brought the experience and confidence needed to help the volunteers become agents of change. She was sweet, kind and unimposing, but tenacious and committed and believed in what she was doing.” The professional contacts she made there helped when she stepped in the '80s as a volunteer executive director of the Cincinnati Chamber Orchestra, then in severe financial shape. During her unpaid tenure, 1987-94, she convinced stars to perform for very small fees, and convinced a skeptical board that they needed to hire a young rising conductor named Keith Lockhart. Under Lockhart, now conductor of the Boston Pops, ticket sales more than doubled, the orchestra cut its first album and made its New York debut. Always devoted to Music Hall, Mrs. Petersen and a group of like-minded supporters founded the nonprofit Society for the Preservation of Music Hall (SPMH) in 1992. She was its longest-serving president, serving from 2002 to 2010. Mrs. Petersen was born in Brigham City, Utah, where she grew up on a farm, the fourth child of Alvera and Martin Anderson Jr. She was proud of her heritage as the great-granddaughter of Mormon pioneer John Davis Rees, who walked with his family across the plains to escape the persecution suffered by the Mormon population in Illinois, and settled in Brigham City in 1853. She told SPMH’s “Music Hall Marks” that the strong Mormon ethic of giving back and its “culture of service” motivated her life. Mrs. Petersen married high school sweetheart Gerald C. Petersen in 1948. They moved to Cincinnati in 1962 when Mr. Petersen took a position with Procter & Gamble, and she began her lifetime of volunteerism working for Hyde Park Schools. After Mr. Petersen’s death in 1994, Mrs. Petersen oversaw the Over-the-Rhine Lighting Project for the Over-the-Rhine Foundation in his memory. “She’d probably want to be remembered as someone who saw what needed to be done, took the bull by the horns and did it,” her son said. “She was never somebody who was looking for a pat on the back or adulation.” Among her honors, Mrs. Petersen was an Enquirer Woman of the Year. Besides her son, Steven, of Clifton, Mrs. Petersen is survived by daughters Jan Leslie, of Pierce Township and Julie Adair, of Eagar, Arizona; and by sons Christopher, of Price Hill, and David, of Westwood. She was the grandmother of 14, and great-grandmother of 19, She was preceded in death by a daughter, Gina Stack, in 2007. Visitation is from 5:30 p.m, to 7:30 p.m. Friday, Sept. 16 at Vorhis & Ryan Funeral Home, 5501 Montgomery Rd., Norwood. Funeral Services will be at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, Sept. 17 at Spring Grove Cemetery in the Norman Chapel. Memorials may be made to the School for Creative and Performing Arts (SCPA), 108 W Central Pkwy, Cincinnati, OH 45202, or Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, 1241 Elm Street, Cincinnati, OH 45202. 684 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2cqCTtA TOP VIDEOS 911 call: I'm being attacked by bear; I'm going to die 1:05 Joe Deters: \u0022I didn't believe the tears for a second\u0022 2:47 Are deals better on Black Friday or Cyber Monday? 1:00 Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 Predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 Student at UC Tensing forum: 'It's time for war' 0:45 Sam DuBose sister: 'This, to me, is murder' 1:30 Protests in Cincinnati after Ray Tensing mistrial 1:09 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Mistrial declared in Ray Tensing case 3:46 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 More Stories Deters: Tensing jury 'straw poll' unanimous for murder Nov. 17, 2016, 7:39 p.m.

Whitelee Wind farm is the largest windfarm in the UK. Photo: Christopher Furlong, Getty Images Amazon invests in massive Texas wind farm 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Amazon is investing in West Texas wind for its largest renewable energy project ever. Seattle-based Amazon is teaming up with Chicago's Lincoln Clean Energy to build the 253-megawatt Amazon Wind Farm Texas west of Abilene in Scurry County. One megawatt typically powers 200 homes on a hot Texas day. The wind farm, slated to open by the end of 2017, will feature more than 100 wind turbines designed to power Amazon cloud data centers and more. "Amazon Wind Farm Texas is our largest renewable energy project to date and the newest milestone in our long-term sustainability efforts across the company," said Kara Hurst, Amazon director of sustainability, in the announcement. Amazon is continuing to expand in Texas. The online shopping juggernaut opened a new, "Silicon Hills" corporate hub last year in Austin and, in 2014, leased out a large chunk of office space at the Dallas Galleria complex. Amazon has Dallas-area warehouses, called fulfillment centers, in Coppell and Haslet. There's also a large Amazon warehouse and customer service center outside of San Antonio in Schertz. Earlier this summer, Amazon pledged to open a new 855,000-square-foot distribution warehouse in north Houston at the Pinto Business Park near Interstate 45 and Beltway 8 that's under development. The Amazon fulfillment center is expected to employ 1,000 people. That's in addition to Amazon's Prime Now warehouse hub in Humble. Amazon also just opened more than 20 "Pop UP" electronics stores nationwide, including two in Texas in San Antonio and Arlington. As for the wind farm, the project costs were not released, but Lincoln CEO Declan Flanagan has described the cost of a 200-megawatt Texas wind farms at about $300 million. Amazon already has announced smaller wind and solar farms in Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia. However, Texas leads the nation by far in wind power. Google, Microsoft, Wal-Mart, General Motors, Procter & Gamble, Dow Chemical Co. and Hewlett-Packard all count among the companies buying power from Texas wind farms. Ikea even owns a wind farm in the state. Lincoln Clean Energy will build and own the Amazon wind farm, but Amazon is contracting to buy 90 percent of the generated power. Lincoln, which also has offices in Austin, is developing other Texas wind projects as well. Its planned Horse Creek Wind project north of Abilene and the Electra Wind development near Wichita Falls — both 200-megawatt wind farms — are still in the works. However, Lincoln's 201-megawatt Nazareth Solar project in the Texas Panhandle has faced ongoing delays. Lincoln previously developed and sold the Hereford and Jumbo Road wind farms in Texas that opened in 2014 and 2015, respectively.

Called “The Coalition for Better Ads,” the group is made up of publishers, advertisers, and advertising trade associations including notable tech companies like Facebook and Google. “Advertising has been the economic driver of the explosive growth of the Internet and mobile media,” said Bob Liodice, CEO of ANA, one of the Coalition members, in a statement. “To assure that advertising fulfills this critical role, the digital marketplace needs continually to be strengthened. Leading brands develop a deep understanding of consumer needs and work to meet them. The Coalition for Better Ads will utilize a similar approach that translates consumer insights into positive action.” The first act by the coalition was to create a uniform standard to assess online advertising, which will be implemented by the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s (IAB) Tech Lab. IAB technology scores ads on several variables (e.g. page load time, number of tracking pixels) to determine which ads are okay and which are not. The group says criterions will be based on the kind of ads consumers like and dislike. “Advertising funds the diversity of information, entertainment, and services on the free Internet, but that doesn’t give business a license to abuse the goodwill of consumers,” said Randall Rothenberg, President and CEO of the IAB, in a statement. “It is essential that industry create standards to assure that consumers get safe, fast, secure delivery of the sites and services they love.” The Coalition was formed by the increasing prevalence of ad blocking. According to research commissioned by the IAB, over a quarter of internet users in the U.S. use an online ad-blocking software on their desktop computers. Related Stories Adblock Plus To Sell 'Acceptable' Ads On Automated Platform Facebook Aims To Power All Online Advertising The complete list of founding members include American Association of Advertising Agencies (4A’s), ANA, BVDW Germany, Digital Content Next, DMA, European Publishers Council, Facebook, Google, GroupM, IAB, IAB Europe, IAB Tech Lab, as well as additional national and regional IABs, Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), News Media Alliance, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, The Washington Post, and World Federation of Advertisers (WFA). The announcement of the coalition comes after Eyeo GmbH—the parent company of popular adblocking software Adblock Plus—revealed that it would be expanding its efforts in selling ads. The company, which previously allowed certain non disruptive ads to remain, launched an automated ad marketplace to let publishers include “acceptable” ads on their site. The IAB has spoken out against Eyeo GmbH’s new marketplace. “No matter how Adblock Plus tries to justify their form of extortion, or make it seem harmless, it is a practice that will continue to erode the value exchange that powers the free and open Internet,” said IAB public policy chief Dave Grimaldi in a statement.

Seattle-based Amazon is teaming up with Chicago’s Lincoln Clean Energy to build the 253-megawatt Amazon Wind Farm Texas west of Abilene in Scurry County. One megawatt typically powers 200 homes on a hot Texas day. The wind farm, which is slated to open by the end of 2017, will feature more than 100 wind turbines designed to help power Amazon’s Texas’ facilities and much more. The electricity will feed into the overall state grid. “Amazon Wind Farm Texas is our largest renewable energy project to date and the newest milestone in our long-term sustainability efforts across the company,” said Kara Hurst, Amazon director of sustainability, in the announcement. Amazon is continuing to expand in Texas. The online shopping juggernaut opened a new, “Silicon Hills” corporate hub last year in Austin and, in 2014, leased out a large chunk of office space at the Dallas Galleria complex. Amazon has Dallas-area warehouses, called fulfillment centers, in Coppell and Haslet. There’s also a large Amazon warehouse and customer service center outside of San Antonio in Schertz. Earlier this summer, Amazon pledged to open a new 855,000-square-foot distribution warehouse in north Houston at the Pinto Business Park near Interstate 45 and Beltway 8 that’s under development. The Amazon fulfillment center is expected to employ 1,000 people. That’s in addition to Amazon’s Prime Now warehouse hub in Humble. Amazon also just opened more than 20 “Pop Up” electronics stores nationwide, including two in Texas in San Antonio and Arlington. As for the wind farm, the project costs were not released, but Lincoln CEO Declan Flanagan has described the cost of a 200-megawatt Texas wind farms at about $300 million. Amazon already has announced smaller wind and solar farms in Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia. However, Texas leads the nation by far in wind power. Google, Microsoft, Wal-Mart, General Motors, Procter & Gamble, Dow Chemical Co. and Hewlett-Packard all count among the companies buying power from Texas wind farms. Ikea even owns a wind farm in the state. Lincoln Clean Energy will build and own the Amazon wind farm, but Amazon is contracting to buy 90 percent of the generated power. Lincoln, which also has offices in Austin, is developing other Texas wind projects as well. Its planned Horse Creek Wind project north of Abilene and the Electra Wind development near Wichita Falls — both 200-megawatt wind farms — are still in the works. However, Lincoln’s 201-megawatt Nazareth Solar project in the Texas Panhandle has faced ongoing delays. Lincoln previously developed and sold the Hereford and Jumbo Road wind farms in Texas that opened in 2014 and 2015, respectively.

The barometer index, the S&P BSE Sensex, rose 69.07 points or 0.24% at 28,441.30, as per the provisional closing data. The Nifty 50 index rose 22.75 points or 0.26% to 8,749.35, as per the provisional closing data. The Sensex and the Nifty alternately moved between positive and negative zone in intraday trade. The Sensex rose 71.71 points, or 0.25% at the day's high of 28,443.94 in late trade, its highest level since 12 September 2016. The index fell 61.12 points, or 0.22% at the day's low of 28,311.11 in mid-morning trade. The Nifty rose 22.60 points, or 0.26% at the day's high of 8,749.20 in late trade, its highest level since 9 September 2016. The index fell 22.25 points, or 0.25% at the day's low of 8,704.35 in mid-morning trade. In overseas stock markets, European stocks were mixed ahead of monetary policy decision from the Bank of England. No interest rate changes are expected from UK's central bank. Policy makers have to assess whether the outlook for Britain after its vote to leave the European Union warrants a change in strategy. Most Asian stocks fell as investors grappled with the seemingly diminishing ability of major central banks to stimulate growth, while a tumble in crude oil inflamed already heightened risk aversion. In US, the Dow industrials and the S&P 500 closed in negative territory yesterday, 14 September 2016, in the wake of slumping crude-oil prices, erasing earlier gains for the major benchmarks, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq bucked the losing trend. Back home, the market breadth indicating the overall health of the market was positive. On BSE, 1,471 shares rose and 1,258 shares fell. A total of 197 shares were unchanged. The BSE Mid-Cap index provisionally fell 0.25%. The BSE Small-Cap index provisionally rose 0.22%. Both these indices underperformed the Sensex. The total turnover on BSE amounted to Rs 3789 crore, higher than turnover of Rs 3616.03 crore registered during the previous trading session. Pharmaceutical shares were mixed. Piramal Enterprises (up 2.32%), Divi's Laboratories (up 1.74%), Strides Shasun (up 1.60%), Cipla (up 1.10%), Wockhardt (up 0.85%), Lupin (up 0.72%), Sun Pharmaceutical Industries (up 0.66%) and GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals (up 0.53%), edged higher.

Index heavyweight and cigarette major ITC rose 1.23% to Rs 255.10 after the company's chief operating officer (COO) Sanjiv Puri was quoted as saying that the firm's consumer goods business presents the maximum potential for value creation. The company reportedly aims to strengthen its footprints in the FMCG sector by bringing in innovative, differentiated and first time products to the market, Puri added. ITC expects to ramp up revenue from branded packaged foods and personal care products to Rs 1 lakh crore by 2030.
