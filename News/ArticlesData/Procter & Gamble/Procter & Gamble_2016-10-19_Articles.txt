Published on October 20, 2016. 'On every part of the canvas, craft matters,' Procter & Gamble Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard said ad the ANA Masters of Marketing conference on Thursday. Credit: Clarion Pictures Most Popular Too many marketers, Procter & Gamble Co. included, have gotten caught in a content "crap trap," and one way out may be to start treating agencies better, according to Procter & Gamble Co. Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard. Mr. Pritchard has talked about P&G's crap-to-craft journey a few times this year, including at Cannes. But a new wrinkle in his Thursday keynote address to the Association of National Advertisers Masters of Marketing Conference in Orlando was an acknowledgment that marketers generally, and P&G specifically, need to let up on pressuring agencies. What sounded like a peace offering may take on added weight given that Mr. Pritchard, now vice chairman of the ANA, is expected to be announced as chairman on Friday, succeeding former Subway CMO Tony Pace. Both have served in their roles the past two years, a period after which the ANA board typically elevates the vice chair. The ANA has had an increasingly contentious relationship with agencies -- particularly media agencies -- over the past 18 months as it probed alleged undisclosed rebates and other non-transparent dealings in the U.S. Mr. Pritchard was specifically addressing issues with creative agencies, given the focus of his talk on "Raising the Creative Bar." But he said it's time to lower pressure on agencies – which has included P&G cutting its agency and production fees the past two year by $570 million to $1.4 billion. Related Stories ANA CEO: 'Marketers Must Take Their Industry Back' Big Hike in Ad Spending Helps P&G Beat Expectations, but Agency Cuts Continue P&G's Pritchard to Agencies: Your Complexity Not Our Problem "Let's also remember that advertising is a creative business, and our agencies are made up of people," he said. "The last few years have been admittedly tough on agencies, P&G included. And it's time to turn the page. The negative narrative needs to stop, because the people in our agencies are good people, the ones who do good work to create magic together with all of us. Let's tap into all that positive human energy to create the most abundant explosion of creativity the world has ever seen." Improving creativity requires craft that "belongs in the hands of serious professionals," Mr. Pritchard said. "Don't ever accept mediocrity. Don't be seduced into the crap trap of just getting something out. On every part of the canvas, craft matters." Doing good creative work also requires time, he said. "And we have a problem, because we're spending too much of our time on measurement of advertising vs. the quality. We're fiddling with measurement debates while consumers are blocking our ads. Measurement is not going to make crappy advertising better." That line generated applause from among what ANA CEO Bob Liodice said is a record 2,700 registrants this year, including 1,500 ANA marketer members. But Mr. Pritchard said he hasn't quit being concerned about measurement, particularly on the media side, as he shifted the transparency discussion toward media companies rather than agencies. "Our patience has run out," Mr. Pritchard said. "It's time to insist that all media partners adopt common, transparent measurement standards and accept third-party verification." Realistically, key players, including Google and Facebook, which dominate digital media, have bowed to marketer demands for third-party measurement in the past year. It was why P&G and others who have outside firms measuring viewership, such as Unilever, weren't surprised by Facebook's recent revelation that it had been overstating average video view times. On creative measurement, while P&G certainly hasn't abandoned copy testing, Mr. Pritchard said he favors a different test for deciding to proceed with work, which is "whether it makes my spine tingle." If it does, it should at least get further development, he said. So the examples he raised from the crap side of the ledger -- such as a Pantene social-media post with a rather unappetizing photo of enchiladas and rice, and a Pepto Bismol video about a boy raised by goats that didn't provide a clue about the brand involved until after the 4-minute mark -- are things he hopes are in the rearview mirror. He expects to see more from the craft side, including a variety of funny or tear-jerking work for Gillette, Tide, Ariel and SK-II.

Breakdown of Q3 2016 revenue by region   EUR  Revenue Organic  Reported Million Q3 2016 Q3 2015 growth growth Europe 643 625 +7.6% +2.9% North America 1,254 1,292 -4.0% -2.9% Asia Pacific 261 260 -0.4% +0.4% Latin America 89 87 +13.1% +2.3% Middle East & Africa 68 61 +4.1% +11.5% Total 2,315 2,325 +0.2% -0.4%     2 - REVENUE AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   In the first nine months of 2016, Publicis Groupe's consolidated revenue totaled 7,068 million euro, up 2.9% from 6,867 million euro for the corresponding period in 2015.  Exchange rates adversely affected revenue by 150 million euro, i.e. the equivalent of 2.2% of revenue for the first nine months of 2015.  Net acquisitions contributed 222 million euro during the first nine months, i.e. the equivalent of 3.2% of 2015 revenue for the same period.  Growth at constant exchange rates was +5.2%, and organic growth stood at +1.9% at September 30, 2016.   Breakdown of revenue at September 30, 2016 by region   EUR  Revenue Organic  Reported Million 9M 2016 9M 2015 growth growth Europe 1,992 1,894 +6.2% +5.2% North America 3,874 3,767 -0.5% +2.8% Asia Pacific 764 746 +2.9% +2.4% Latin America 241 278 +5.1% -13.3% Middle East & Africa 197 182 +1.0% +8.2% Total 7,068 6,867 +1.9% +2.9%   Europe's revenue grew by 5.2%.  When the impact of acquisitions and exchange rates is factored out, organic growth stands at +6.2%, with a strong performance in France (above 5%), and strong momentum in Germany and Italy (growth of close to 10%), helped by a more conducive macroeconomic environment.  The situation was volatile in Russia where growth stood at more than 9% at September 30 after growth of almost 5% in the first half year.  The UK has picked up sharply and recorded growth of almost 5% (including +7% in the third quarter). Digital continued to post high growth in Europe generally (+13.9%)   North America reported growth of 2.8% at September 30, though organic growth was -0.5% (organic growth was -4.0% in the third quarter).  This downturn was attributable to media subsequent to the loss of certain media accounts in the 2015 media palooza, as well as the end of several digital projects at a time when new projects have not reached their full growth potential yet.   Asia Pacific reported growth of 2.4% (organic growth of 2.9%), with especially satisfactory performance levels in China and India.   Latin America was down 13.3% on a reported basis mainly due to exchange rates as this area recorded positive organic growth of 5.1%.  Brazil picked up to record strong revenue growth of 10.9% in the third quarter, and Mexico continued to boast high growth (+20.5% in Q3 after 11.5% in the first half year).    The Middle East & Africa achieved reported growth of 8.2% and organic growth of 1.0%.   Breakdown of revenue at September 30, 2016 by region: digital and analog     Europe North America Asia Pacific Latin America Middle East & Africa Total Digital +13.9% +0.3% +19.2% +3.2% +7.8% +4.9% Analog -0.2% -1.8% -4.7% +5.5% -0.9% -1.3% Total +6.2% -0.5% +2.9% +5.1% +1.0% +1.9%   The Groupe's growth continued to be driven by its digital activities (organic growth of +4.9%), with double-digit growth in Europe and Asia Pacific.  North America only grew by +0.3% due to the media account losses of 2015 and the end of several digital projects when new projects have been recorded a slow start.  Despite the Q3 slowdown of organic growth that can be ascribed to the very strong comparable period in 2015, Sapient continues to be buoyed posting a satisfactory growth rate at September 30.  It should also be pointed out that analog activities continued to decline.   3 - NET DEBT   At September 30, 2016, net debt amounted to 2,452 million euro, compared with 1,872 million euro at December 31, 2015.  The Groupe's average net debt at September 30, 2016 was 2,443 million euro after 2,305 million euro at September 30, 2015.  It should be recalled that the Sapient acquisition was completed on February 6, 2015.     4 - HIGHLIGHTS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   4.1 - Transformation   During the first half of 2016, Publicis Groupe ended the traditional structure of the holding company and silos and has reorganized its operations by putting clients at the heart of the Groupe. Thus, clients have access to all the Groupe's capabilities ("The Power of One") to meet their needs in commerce, marketing or transformation.   The Groupe should reap the benefits of this organization in the forthcoming quarters.  The initial results are very promising with accounts gained that include Wal-Mart, P&G's home care brands, Asda, GSK, HPE and USAA.   4.2 - Digital    Activities in digital and technology now represent 54% of Groupe revenue. The Sapient integration is going well and its performance is very satisfactory. Razorfish, which suffered headwinds for several quarters, recorded in the third quarter its best quarter ever in terms of new business in its history thanks to the support of Sapient and "The Power of One".   4.3 - Groupe commitment to start-ups   -    Viva Technology Paris. In conjunction with Groupe les Echos, Publicis Groupe staged a global event in Paris bringing together start-ups and the main stakeholders in the digital environment.  This rendez-vous, held from June 30 to July 2, attracted 5,000 start-ups, dozens of major industrial groups and investors, and included over 300 conferences with the top names in the global high-tech sector.  With over 45,000 visitors in three days, Viva Technology proved a tremendous success and underscored the pre-eminent place of Publicis Groupe in the global digital economy.  This event should be staged every year from now on. -    Publicis90. On the occasion of its 90th anniversary, Publicis Groupe launched a project named Publicis90. The idea was to provide 90 projects or start-ups with financial aid and the support of the Groupe's digital experts.  After an initial phase of stringent selection over a period of several months, the winners were selected from among the 3,500 contestants from 130 countries, and received their awards at a ceremony held during Viva Technology.   4.4 - Global partnership with Tencent   Publicis Groupe has entered into a strategic partnership with Tencent, the internet giant that operates the most popular social and media platforms in China.  This partnership is a first-of-its-kind collaboration between a global communications group and China's biggest internet company.  It spans the Groupe's three solutions hubs (Publicis Media, Publicis Communications and Publicis.Sapient) as well as Tencent's eleven product lines.  This agreement will cement the groups' relationship at a global level while providing clients with access to all Tencent's innovative solutions via a unique, borderless approach built on three pillars: -    a tremendous capacity for innovation: through this partnership, Publicis Groupe and Tencent will launch an incubation facility in China called "Drugstore".  The goal is to curate, invest in and cultivate the start-ups of the future.  This will provide breakthrough offerings to our clients in data and ad tech, as well as across new virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) platforms; -    an exceptional source of data: Publicis Groupe will have access to digital behavior databases that will benefit its clients through improved programmatic offerings and cross-screen planning capabilities; -    innovative web content: the two companies will partner on the creation and co-investment of web-native content to drive unique content opportunities and new content models for key clients.   4.5 - Acquisitions   -    MercerBell is a leading Australian agency in the field of customer experience. MercerBell is specialized in CRM and digital strategy, creativity, content and technology, and will be integrated into Saatchi & Saatchi. This agency, which was founded in 1999, has a team of 65 professionals and a customer base that includes Toyota, Foxtel, Quantas, BT, Allianz and ASX. -    Vertiba, the Salesforce partner, is specialized in marketing solutions.  Founded in 2010, Vertiba is headquartered in Boulder, Colorado.  Vertiba's skills will be integrated into the Publicis.Sapient platform. -    Seven Seconds, the London (UK) based e-commerce and digital specialist, was founded in 2013 and will be integrated into BBH.  Its main clients are British Airways, Barclays, Boots, Tesco Retail and Tesco Bank. -    Venus Communications is one of the leading public relations agencies in Vietnam.  Venus has been integrated into the MSL brand, which in turn is part of Publicis One in Vietnam.  Over the last 10 years, Venus and MSL have worked together successfully on numerous assignments.

In celebration of 25 years of Habitat’s ReStore program, Swiffer will donate $1 for every transaction at the secondhand outlets until the end of October. “Since 2013, P&G and Swiffer have been strong supporters of Habitat for Humanity Canada and we couldn’t be happier to partner again to help celebrate this landmark anniversary for Habitat ReStore,” said Corinne Durieu, communications manager from Procter & Gamble Canada. “We encourage Canadians to visit their local ReStore and take part in this promotion, which is a step towards ensuring all Canadians have a safe and affordable place to call home.” With nearly 100 locations across Canada, including 3311 Oak St. here in Saanich, Habitat for Humanity’s ReStores are home and building supply stores that accept and resell quality new and used building supplies, home furnishing, appliances and décor. Habitat’s ReStores accept donations of secondhand, overstocked and discontinued items, as well as salvageable building materials donated by manufacturers, stores, contractors and individuals. Proceeds fund Habitat for Humanity operations and homebuilding projects in communities across the country. “Supporting Habitat for Humanity’s ReStore means more families are able to partner with Habitat for Humanity, building strength, stability and self-reliance,” said Mark Rodgers, president and CEO of Habitat for Humanity Canada. “We’re so grateful that Swiffer has come on board to help us celebrate the 25th anniversary of Habitat’s ReStore and that this promotion will encourage more Canadians to get out to their local store.” To provide additional incentive, Swiffer is also giving out a free Swiffer Duster with all purchases while supplies last. The funds generated through this campaign will be used towards Habitat for Humanity Victoria’s builds in the local community.   It’s estimated that Habitat’s ReStores in Canada have been directly responsible for the construction of 1,200 Habitat for Humanity homes and in excess of 250,000 tonnes of material being diverted from landfills.     We encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story's topic, but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards.

Diese Unternehmen könnten Interesse habenAnleger aufgepasst! Was Fonds-Anteilen nach Silvester droht Regulatory News: Publicis Groupe (Paris:PUB): 3rd Quarter 2016       Revenue    2,315 million Reported growth -0.4% Growth at constant exchange rates +1.5% Organic growth   +0.2% At September 30, 2016       Revenue    7,068 million Reported growth +2.9% Growth at constant exchange rates +5.2% Organic growth   +1.9% Maurice Lévy, Chairman and CEO of Publicis Groupe: « Publicis Groupes revenue at September 30, 2016 was up 2.9% over the corresponding period in 2015, and by 5.2% when exchange rates are factored out. Organic growth for the period was 1.9%. Unsurprisingly, growth decelerated in the third quarter to 0.2%. As announced, the third and fourth quarters of the year are the most significantly impacted by accounts lost in the media palooza. This was compounded by projects recently completed at Razorfish that will only be relayed by new projects in the fourth quarter, but that will produce their full effect in 2017. Therefore, on the geographical standpoint, North America showed a sharp downturn (-4.0%) while Europe reported a strong growth (+7.6%). As anticipated, it is in 2017 that we will reap the full benefits of the new "Power of One organization we are implementing. The initial results are already there, as evidenced by the large accounts awarded to us by advertisers such as Wal-Mart, GSK, HPE, Coty and USAA. It is worth noting "The Power of One" has been very successful at Razorfish which experienced the best ever quarter for new business. Regarding the fourth quarter, like every year, economic uncertainties can result in marketing investments becoming the adjustment variable in the equation towards the end of the year. We have nonetheless confidence in our ability to reach our objectives, which is why the Management Board has moved that the 42% payout ratio we had been targeting for 2018 be decided as of 2016. As indicated quite some time ago, the formal process of identifying my successor will commence in November, leading to a decision to be taken by the Supervisory Board, no later than at its meeting of February 2017. » 1  Q3 2016 REVENUE Publicis Groupes consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2016 was 2,315 million euro, 0.4% below the 2,325 million euro reported for the corresponding period in 2015. Exchange rates impacted revenue negatively by 45 million euro, i.e. the equivalent of 1.9% of Q3 2015 revenue. Net acquisitions contributed 31 million euro to revenue in Q3 2016, i.e. the equivalent of 1.3% of Q3 2015 revenue. Growth at constant exchange rates was +1.5%. Organic growth was +0.2% in the third quarter, below the growth rate at June 30 due to the more significant impact of media accounts lost in the 2015 media palooza  an impact that will remain high in Q4  and to the end of several digital projects when new projects have not reached their full growth potential yet. Breakdown of Q3 2016 revenue by region EUR   Revenue   Organic   Reported Million   Q3 2016   Q3 2015   growth   growth Europe 643   625 +7.6% +2.9% North America 1,254 1,292 -4.0% -2.9% Asia Pacific 261 260 -0.4% +0.4% Latin America 89 87 +13.1% +2.3% Middle East & Africa   68   61   +4.1%   +11.5% Total   2,315   2,325   +0.2%   -0.4% 2  REVENUE AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 In the first nine months of 2016, Publicis Groupes consolidated revenue totaled 7,068 million euro, up 2.9% from 6,867 million euro for the corresponding period in 2015. Exchange rates adversely affected revenue by 150 million euro, i.e. the equivalent of 2.2% of revenue for the first nine months of 2015. Net acquisitions contributed 222 million euro during the first nine months, i.e. the equivalent of 3.2% of 2015 revenue for the same period. Growth at constant exchange rates was +5.2%, and organic growth stood at +1.9% at September 30, 2016. Breakdown of revenue at September 30, 2016 by region EUR   Revenue   Organic   Reported Million   9M 2016   9M 2015   growth   growth Europe 1,992   1,894 +6.2% +5.2% North America 3,874 3,767 -0.5% +2.8% Asia Pacific 764 746 +2.9% +2.4% Latin America 241 278 +5.1% -13.3% Middle East & Africa   197   182   +1.0%   +8.2% Total   7,068   6,867   +1.9%   +2.9% Europes revenue grew by 5.2%. When the impact of acquisitions and exchange rates is factored out, organic growth stands at +6.2%, with a strong performance in France (above 5%), and strong momentum in Germany and Italy (growth of close to 10%), helped by a more conducive macroeconomic environment. The situation was volatile in Russia where growth stood at more than 9% at September 30 after growth of almost 5% in the first half year. The UK has picked up sharply and recorded growth of almost 5% (including +7% in the third quarter). Digital continued to post high growth in Europe generally (+13.9%) North America reported growth of 2.8% at September 30, though organic growth was -0.5% (organic growth was -4.0% in the third quarter). This downturn was attributable to media subsequent to the loss of certain media accounts in the 2015 media palooza, as well as the end of several digital projects at a time when new projects have not reached their full growth potential yet. Asia Pacific reported growth of 2.4% (organic growth of 2.9%), with especially satisfactory performance levels in China and India. Latin America was down 13.3% on a reported basis mainly due to exchange rates as this area recorded positive organic growth of 5.1%. Brazil picked up to record strong revenue growth of 10.9% in the third quarter, and Mexico continued to boast high growth (+20.5% in Q3 after 11.5% in the first half year). The Middle East & Africa achieved reported growth of 8.2% and organic growth of 1.0%. Breakdown of revenue at September 30, 2016 by region: digital and analog   Europe   North   Asia   Latin   Middle East   Total         America   Pacific   America   & Africa     Digital   +13.9%   +0.3%   +19.2%   +3.2%   +7.8%   +4.9% Analog   -0.2%   -1.8%   -4.7%   +5.5%   -0.9%   -1.3% Total   +6.2%   -0.5%   +2.9%   +5.1%   +1.0%   +1.9% The Groupes growth continued to be driven by its digital activities (organic growth of +4.9%), with double-digit growth in Europe and Asia Pacific. North America only grew by +0.3% due to the media account losses of 2015 and the end of several digital projects when new projects have been recorded a slow start. Despite the Q3 slowdown of organic growth that can be ascribed to the very strong comparable period in 2015, Sapient continues to be buoyed posting a satisfactory growth rate at September 30. It should also be pointed out that analog activities continued to decline. 3  NET DEBT At September 30, 2016, net debt amounted to 2,452 million euro, compared with 1,872 million euro at December 31, 2015. The Groupes average net debt at September 30, 2016 was 2,443 million euro after 2,305 million euro at September 30, 2015. It should be recalled that the Sapient acquisition was completed on February 6, 2015. 4  HIGHLIGHTS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 4.1 - Transformation During the first half of 2016, Publicis Groupe ended the traditional structure of the holding company and silos and has reorganized its operations by putting clients at the heart of the Groupe. Thus, clients have access to all the Groupe's capabilities ("The Power of One) to meet their needs in commerce, marketing or transformation. The Groupe should reap the benefits of this organization in the forthcoming quarters. The initial results are very promising with accounts gained that include Wal-Mart, P&Gs home care brands, Asda, GSK, HPE and USAA. 4.2  Digital Activities in digital and technology now represent 54% of Groupe revenue. The Sapient integration is going well and its performance is very satisfactory. Razorfish, which suffered headwinds for several quarters, recorded in the third quarter its best quarter ever in terms of new business in its history thanks to the support of Sapient and "The Power of One. 4.3  Groupe commitment to start-ups - Viva Technology Paris. In conjunction with Groupe les Echos, Publicis Groupe staged a global event in Paris bringing together start-ups and the main stakeholders in the digital environment. This rendez-vous, held from June 30 to July 2, attracted 5,000 start-ups, dozens of major industrial groups and investors, and included over 300 conferences with the top names in the global high-tech sector. With over 45,000 visitors in three days, Viva Technology proved a tremendous success and underscored the pre-eminent place of Publicis Groupe in the global digital economy. This event should be staged every year from now on. - Publicis90. On the occasion of its 90th anniversary, Publicis Groupe launched a project named Publicis90. The idea was to provide 90 projects or start-ups with financial aid and the support of the Groupes digital experts. After an initial phase of stringent selection over a period of several months, the winners were selected from among the 3,500 contestants from 130 countries, and received their awards at a ceremony held during Viva Technology. 4.4  Global partnership with Tencent Publicis Groupe has entered into a strategic partnership with Tencent, the internet giant that operates the most popular social and media platforms in China. This partnership is a first-of-its-kind collaboration between a global communications group and Chinas biggest internet company. It spans the Groupes three solutions hubs (Publicis Media, Publicis Communications and Publicis.Sapient) as well as Tencents eleven product lines. This agreement will cement the groups relationship at a global level while providing clients with access to all Tencents innovative solutions via a unique, borderless approach built on three pillars: - a tremendous capacity for innovation: through this partnership, Publicis Groupe and Tencent will launch an incubation facility in China called "Drugstore. The goal is to curate, invest in and cultivate the start-ups of the future. This will provide breakthrough offerings to our clients in data and ad tech, as well as across new virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) platforms; - an exceptional source of data: Publicis Groupe will have access to digital behavior databases that will benefit its clients through improved programmatic offerings and cross-screen planning capabilities; - innovative web content: the two companies will partner on the creation and co-investment of web-native content to drive unique content opportunities and new content models for key clients. 4.5 - Acquisitions - MercerBell is a leading Australian agency in the field of customer experience.

Venus has been integrated into the MSL brand, which in turn is part of Publicis One in Vietnam. Over the last 10 years, Venus and MSL have worked together successfully on numerous assignments. The agency, which was founded in 1998, has over 40 employees and a prestigious client portfolio that includes MasterCard, FedEx, Rolls Royce, BAT, Mead Johnson and Sanofi. - Troyka Group, in which Publicis Groupe has taken a stake, is West Africas first fully-integrated communications services group. The Troyka group is comprised of six agencies, i.e. Insight Communications, The Thinkshop, All Seasons Media, Media Perspectives, The Quadrant Company, and Hotsauce. Starting out with Insight Communications in 1980, the Troyka group now has 300 employees over six agencies across the entire region. The Troyka agencies work with prestigious international brands such as Heineken, Shell, Samsung, Unilever, Google, P&G, Microsoft, Ford and Axa, as well as with national brands including Oando, Nestoil, Africa Investor, Jagal, and Olam. Publicis Groupe has been investing regularly in Africa in recent years, in view of the high growth potential of this market. By way of this equity investment, Publicis Groupe will use Troyka to launch its network in Nigeria, thereby creating a powerful communications entity that will have a competitive edge in all skill sets in West Africa. 5 - OUTLOOK The Groupes transformation is the most radical ever imagined in its sector. It is being carried out to meet clients new requirements in selling their products or in their own transformation. Publicis Groupe has abolished the notion of holding company with silo-type operating structures. The results to date, obtained with the implementation of the new "Power of One organization, have been very promising, with accounts gained including Wal-Mart, Asda, P&Gs home care products, GSK, HPE, Coty and USAA. Publicis Groupe is confirming its previous guidance for 2016 in spite of the 250 to 300 basis point negative impact on the growth of the second half of 2016. On top, the fourth quarter is usually characterized by uncertainty surrounding advertisers budget management. We approach 2017 cautiously given the lack of visibility owing to elections in the US, France and Germany, and the consequences of "Brexit, not just for the UK for also for the rest of Europe. The Management Board will be proposing that the 2018 objective of a 42% payout (compared with 39.5% in 2015) be brought forward in respect of financial 2016. * * * Disclaimer Certain information contained in this document, other than historical information, may constitute forward-looking statements or unaudited financial forecasts.

Consumer goods companies have been grappling with slowing volume sales over the past year, hit by falling household spending across the world, fierce competition from retailers' own-brand products and economic weakness in emerging markets. The pound's plunge since the June Brexit vote has put extra pressure on firms like Unilever <ULVR.L>, whose brands include Marmite yeast spread and Dove soap, by driving up the cost of their imports to Britain and dollar-traded commodities. Last week the Anglo-Dutch company tried to raise the prices of a range of products by 10 percent in Britain, prompting a stand-off with the country's largest supermarket, Tesco <TSCO.L>, which balked at the demand. The dispute - which showed an early effect of Britain's decision to leave the EU - was quickly resolved, but gave the public a rare glimpse into the difficult discussions that industry sources say are happening across the sector. An executive at one of Unilever's main rivals said it was also discussing possible price increases with UK supermarkets. A source at another rival said it faced the same pressures as Unilever but that it was not yet ready to raise prices and first wanted to exhaust cost-cutting options. Spirits company Pernod Ricard <PERP.PA> told Reuters it was planning price increases in Britain too. The Unilever row illustrated how reliant the company is on price rises - rather than increased volume sales - to make more money from shoppers around the world and how difficult that strategy may be to keep up, even as volatile currency and commodity environments drive up costs. The day "Marmitegate" dominated the front pages of British newspapers, the company reported a 3.2 percent rise in quarterly sales - with a 0.4 percent drop in the number of goods sold comfortably offset by a 3.6 percent increase in prices. It is not alone among its peers in this trend of slowing volumes and rising prices. This could put the sector on course for a long battle with big retailers like British supermarkets, which conversely need high sales volumes because of their tight margins and fixed costs, and low prices due to fierce competition in the domestic market. How this conflict might play out is unclear, with the Tesco row perhaps just a taste of what is to come. French food group Danone <DANO.PA>, which makes Activia yoghurt and Aptamil baby formula, reported a 0.7 percent fall in third-quarter volumes this week but, like Unilever, used price increases to drive a 2.1 percent rise in sales. Britain's Reckitt Benckiser's <RB.L>, which does not break down its sales by volumes and price rises, reported its weakest quarterly growth in over five years on Wednesday. Nestle <NESN.S> also posted its weakest sales growth in more than a decade on Thursday, with volumes slowing. Procter & Gamble <PG.N> reports results next week. Unilever, Reckitt and P&G all declined to comment on any future plans for price increases, while Danone did not respond to a request for comment. WHY UNILEVER? Unilever is the No. 1 supplier of ice cream, deodorants, bath and shower products and margarines and spreads in many countries, and has invested in marketing and brand innovation over the years, which gives it pricing power. But industry experts said the company's request for 10 percent price rises in Britain was aggressive, and that they did not expect its rivals to demand such high increases. "We think all UK food producers are going to need price increases in the next few months but we can't see 10 percent," said Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo. "Unilever's pricing strategy does seem to be about as aggressive as it could be." Unilever said its reliance on price increases was largely down to factors including weak consumer demand in emerging markets and the sharp devaluation of Latin American currencies. It is more exposed to these regions than most of its peers. Emerging markets as a whole account for almost 60 percent of its sales, with Latin America generating 16 percent of sales. Much of the company's third-quarter price rises were to offset currency devaluations in Latin America. It said currency swings globally had made its commodity costs 600 million euros ($659.5 million) more expensive this year, with a large part of that coming from Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Unilever also said the rise in palm oil and crude prices was driving up the cost of manufacturing skin cleansers and laundry detergents - product categories where it is the dominant player in many markets including Britain. The Tesco dispute and earnings report raised investor concerns about the strength of its business, pushing its shares down more than 6 percent. Trevor Green, head of UK Equities at Unilever shareholder Aviva Investors, expressed confidence in CEO Paul Polman's team, telling Reuters they had done a good job of balancing price and volume growth over the past seven years. Another Unilever investor, Swiss asset management firm GAM, said the fall in sales volumes was tolerable for now. "If it's a quarter or two quarters, I'm not worried," GAM fund manager Xavier Van Hove said. "If it persists for more than four quarters, then yes, I would start to worry."

She previously worked for Reuters and the Wall Street Journal. Follow @labboudles Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Oct 20, 2016 7:46 AM EDT When Maurice Levy steps down next year, he will have been the head of Publicis for three decades. With the support of the Badinter family, which founded the company, he built Publicis from a sleepy regional player into the world's third-biggest ad agency.  Third-quarter organic sales growth 0.2% But this lion of ad land is limping to the end of his tenure. Levy will leave his yet-to-be-identified successor with a long to-do list. Since his plan to merge Publicis with second-largest rival Omnicom fell apart in 2014, the French-based agency has been losing market share to competitors including WPP, Omnicom and Havas. It lost marquee brands such as Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola when a spate of U.S. contracts went up for renewal last year. Painful Stretch Publicis has trailed competitors in terms of organic sales growth since the failure of a planned merger with Omnicom in May 2014. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence Those contract losses are being felt. Third-quarter sales (excluding acquisitions) grew by only 0.2 percent to reach 2.32 billion euros, the company said on Thursday. The figures narrowly missed analyst estimates and sent the shares down 6 percent. That takes organic sales growth in the first nine months of the year to 1.9 percent, which is better than 1 percent in the same period last year. But it pales in comparison to the 3.4 percent that Omnicom has achieved in the same period. Publicis's problem isn't about cost controls -- at 17.4 percent its 2015 Ebitda margin was the best among the top five agencies. It's more a question of revenue and coaxing employees to generate more of it. Sales per employee trail its peers. Labor Intensive Advertising agencies' main cost of doing business is salaries so squeezing the most out of their talent is a competitive advantage. Publicis trails leader Omnicom in terms of sales per employee. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence Publicis replaced managers after the contract losses, and overhauled its structure to ensure disparate agencies worked better together. While the company has won some new business lately, including Wal-Mart, investors will hope more benefits lie ahead. Worse, the $3.7 billion acquisition of digital agency Sapient in 2014 hasn't yet delivered the hoped-for boost to growth. The deal was designed to help Publicis offer more technology consulting services to clients. Sapient has an army of 8,500 developers in India who build mobile apps and e-commerce systems. The deal set Publicis apart from rivals and pits it against consultants like Accenture and Deloitte who are creeping onto ad agency turf. Levy cast the deal as a visionary move and promised it would raise group operating margins by 2018.  It will be up to his successor to get more out of the business. Publicis's return on invested capital, which includes acquisitions, trails its peers, as this chart shows. M&A Machines Advertising agencies do lots of acquisitions to bolster digital skills and geographical reach. Yet the return on invested capital at Publicis has been worsening in recent years. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence Succeeding the charismatic Levy was always going to be a big task. A board committee has started work, and a decision is expected early next year. Levy has hinted that internal candidates are preferred. Arthur Sadoun, who heads all of Publicis' creative agencies, is a leading candidate, and may share the CEO title with Alan Herrick, who joined with the Sapient deal,  according to a recent report in Les Echos.  Whether Levy is asked to stay on as a board member or vice-chairman would be a sign of whether the Badinter family want him to help with the transition or prefer a clean break. Either way, his successor needs find a way to sharpen up the Publicis pitch. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A LONDON: Unilever's push to raise the prices of its brands in Britain in response to a fall in the pound exposed the vulnerabilities of a company: and wider consumer brands industry: that can no longer count on selling more goods to deliver revenue growth. Consumer goods companies have been grappling with slowing volume sales over the past year, hit by falling household spending across the world, fierce competition from retailers' own-brand products and economic weakness in emerging markets. The pound's plunge since the June Brexit vote has put extra pressure on firms like Unilever , whose brands include Marmite yeast spread and Dove soap, by driving up the cost of their imports to Britain and dollar-traded commodities. Last week the Anglo-Dutch company tried to raise the prices of a range of products by 10 percent in Britain, prompting a stand-off with the country's largest supermarket, Tesco , which balked at the demand. The dispute - which showed an early effect of Britain's decision to leave the EU - was quickly resolved, but gave the public a rare glimpse into the difficult discussions that industry sources say are happening across the sector. An executive at one of Unilever's main rivals said it was also discussing possible price increases with UK supermarkets. A source at another rival said it faced the same pressures as Unilever but that it was not yet ready to raise prices and first wanted to exhaust cost-cutting options. Spirits company Pernod Ricard told Reuters it was planning price increases in Britain too. The Unilever row illustrated how reliant the company is on price rises - rather than increased volume sales - to make more money from shoppers around the world and how difficult that strategy may be to keep up, even as volatile currency and commodity environments drive up costs. The day "Marmitegate" dominated the front pages of British newspapers, the company reported a 3.2 percent rise in quarterly sales - with a 0.4 percent drop in the number of goods sold comfortably offset by a 3.6 percent increase in prices. It is not alone among its peers in this trend of slowing volumes and rising prices. This could put the sector on course for a long battle with big retailers like British supermarkets, which conversely need high sales volumes because of their tight margins and fixed costs, and low prices due to fierce competition in the domestic market. How this conflict might play out is unclear, with the Tesco row perhaps just a taste of what is to come. French food group Danone , which makes Activia yoghurt and Aptamil baby formula, reported a 0.7 percent fall in third-quarter volumes this week but, like Unilever, used price increases to drive a 2.1 percent rise in sales. Britain's Reckitt Benckiser's , which does not break down its sales by volumes and price rises, reported its weakest quarterly growth in over five years on Wednesday. Nestle also posted its weakest sales growth in more than a decade on Thursday, with volumes slowing. Procter & Gamble reports results next week. Unilever, Reckitt and P&G all declined to comment on any future plans for price increases, while Danone did not respond to a request for comment. WHY UNILEVER? Unilever is the No. 1 supplier of ice cream, deodorants, bath and shower products and margarines and spreads in many countries, and has invested in marketing and brand innovation over the years, which gives it pricing power. But industry experts said the company's request for 10 percent price rises in Britain was aggressive, and that they did not expect its rivals to demand such high increases. "We think all UK food producers are going to need price increases in the next few months but we can't see 10 percent," said Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo. "Unilever's pricing strategy does seem to be about as aggressive as it could be." Unilever said its reliance on price increases was largely down to factors including weak consumer demand in emerging markets and the sharp devaluation of Latin American currencies. It is more exposed to these regions than most of its peers. Emerging markets as a whole account for almost 60 percent of its sales, with Latin America generating 16 percent of sales. Much of the company's third-quarter price rises were to offset currency devaluations in Latin America. It said currency swings globally had made its commodity costs 600 million euros (US$659.5 million) more expensive this year, with a large part of that coming from Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Unilever also said the rise in palm oil and crude prices was driving up the cost of manufacturing skin cleansers and laundry detergents - product categories where it is the dominant player in many markets including Britain. The Tesco dispute and earnings report raised investor concerns about the strength of its business, pushing its shares down more than 6 percent. Trevor Green, head of UK Equities at Unilever shareholder Aviva Investors, expressed confidence in CEO Paul Polman's team, telling Reuters they had done a good job of balancing price and volume growth over the past seven years. Another Unilever investor, Swiss asset management firm GAM, said the fall in sales volumes was tolerable for now. "If it's a quarter or two quarters, I'm not worried," GAM fund manager Xavier Van Hove said. "If it persists for more than four quarters, then yes, I would start to worry."

Business When trouble hits, company reputations can suffer Ronald McDonald Allen Cunningham / Daily Southtown Ronald McDonald clowns around Apriil 22, 2016, at a youth basketball game in Olympia Fields.

McDonald's recently has put its clown mascot on a bit of a commercial hiatus as a rash of creepy clown sightings have made headlines. (Allen Cunningham / Daily Southtown) Robert ReedContact ReporterChicago Tribune So it's come to this: McDonald's is benching the Ronald. As the Tribune recently reported, clown mascot Ronald McDonald is on a commercial hiatus, the result of a company effort to distance one of the world's most recognized corporate symbols from a recent flurry of bizarre and disturbing clown sightings that have been linked to threatening incidents near college campuses and elsewhere. McDonald's decision is understandable. Companies ignoring issues that could hurt their reputations, including multimillion-dollar investments in corporate mascots and symbols, are just begging for trouble, experts contend. That goes for businesses that are innocent victims of outside events, like McDonald's, and those that cook up their own difficulties, such as Wells Fargo, which allegedly created more than 2 million fraudulent customer banking accounts over five years. Computer outage could tarnish Delta's on-time reputation Tribune news services We don't cancel flights. That's been the message for the past two years from Delta Air Lines. Double decker buses roamed the streets of New York, wrapped in ads proclaiming "canceling cancellations." Delta executives boasted about the number of days without a single flight scrapped. That all literally... We don't cancel flights. That's been the message for the past two years from Delta Air Lines. Double decker buses roamed the streets of New York, wrapped in ads proclaiming "canceling cancellations." Delta executives boasted about the number of days without a single flight scrapped. That all literally... (Tribune news services) We've heard the adage: "Never let a good crisis go to waste." Too often, however, companies mismanage their calamities and end up making matters worse. "You got to say your apologies, fix the problem and wait," says Kent Grayson, associate professor of marketing at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. It may seem funny, but shielding a corporate mascot is one of the first lines of defense. McDonald's declined to comment on that matter, so I connected with another corporate symbol with deep Chicago roots: the Pillsbury doughboy. The doughboy, aka Poppin' Fresh, was created by Rudolph Perz when he worked for Chicago-based advertising agency Leo Burnett. Mess with the doughboy and expect a call from one of owner General Mills' phalanx of attorneys, who protect the 50-year-old symbol and other product icons like Betty Crocker from being mistreated in pop culture, on the internet or anywhere else. "If we see the doughboy being misused, we remedy that situation," said a spokesman for Minneapolis-based General Mills. "The Pillsbury doughboy is our brand ambassador." Stamping out urban myths about corporate symbols is also a priority of consumer product companies. An example: Procter & Gamble, the maker of Tide and Mr. Clean, takes legal aim at groups or individuals caught spreading wild rumors that Cincinnati-based P&G is affiliated with Satanism and that an old corporate symbol of the moon and stars included a subliminal homage to the devil. That fight has been going on for decades. Ronald McDonald has kept low profile long before clown scare Samantha Bomkamp Ronald. Paging Ronald. Are you there, Ronald? McDonald's said Tuesday that its trusty clown mascot Ronald McDonald is taking a hiatus in response to a rash of creepy clown sightings across the U.S. and even across the pond. But he was keeping a low profile long before that. Ronald McDonald has... Ronald. Paging Ronald. Are you there, Ronald?

But he was keeping a low profile long before that. Ronald McDonald has... (Samantha Bomkamp) While damaging gossip is enough to make anyone see red, companies that inflict pain on themselves have the hardest time repairing their reputations. Consider Volkswagen, which was caught in a nasty scandal after U.S. regulators claimed the German-based automaker allegedly rigged emission testing on more than 1 million of its diesel vehicles. In a 2016 Harris annual poll on corporate reputations for the nations' 100 most visible companies, Volkswagen's troubles gave it enough notoriety to break into that ranking, coming in at 100. But it also racked up a "very poor" reputational rating, a decline from its "very good" result a year before, when it was not in the Harris top 100 but was more widely respected. The Harris survey attributed Volkswagen's plummet to a breakdown in public trust, admiration, respect and social responsibility. Volkswagen has vowed to regain customer trust. Can damaged enterprises salvage their reputations? Experts say it is possible, provided companies shake the delusional view that the crisis is merely a public relations snafu or an annoyance. Some consumers shy away from Wells Fargo in wake of scandal Jonnelle Marte Some consumers may be shying away from Wells Fargo after learning that employees used customers' information to open sham accounts, according to new figures reported by the bank. The nation's largest retail bank beat expectations when it reported more than $5.6 billion in profit for the past three... Some consumers may be shying away from Wells Fargo after learning that employees used customers' information to open sham accounts, according to new figures reported by the bank. The nation's largest retail bank beat expectations when it reported more than $5.6 billion in profit for the past three... (Jonnelle Marte) That's especially important if the public determines the root cause of a corporate crisis is executive greed, ruthlessness or incompetence. If so, then issuing a perfunctory apology and urging everyone to move forward won't cut it. Instead, a company that's under fire should act to change its culture, which typically means replacing some upper management, working with critics or government to solve the problem, discontinuing systemic practices that allowed the crisis to fester and then realizing it will take time before anyone notices a difference. But consumers will cut companies some slack even after being let down. The Harris poll indicates folks get annoyed but don't hold a long grudge when technological woes or work stoppages temporarily disrupt service. The same goes for companies dealing with short-term financial stumbles that may momentarily freak out Wall Street but are shrugged off by Main Street. Even so, more companies are realizing corporate reputations are part of a fragile compact with society, one that requires attention, tending and protection. Or to put it another way: That's why McDonald's isn't just clowning around. roreed@chicagotribune.com Twitter @reedtribbiz Copyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune Wells Fargo Leo Burnett There's high interest in cracking down on payday lending — and pushback, too Meet the Ohio resident who quit his law firm job to run a Cubs blog Illinois business: Let's make a Cuba trade deal Breaking Sports Trending Opinion Suburbs Entertainment Business Advertising 47°

"Unilever's pricing strategy does seem to be about as aggressive as it could be." Unilever said its reliance on price increases was largely down to factors including weak consumer demand in emerging markets and the sharp devaluation of Latin American currencies. It is more exposed to these regions than most of its peers. Emerging markets as a whole account for almost 60 percent of its sales, with Latin America generating 16 percent of sales. Much of the company's third-quarter price rises were to offset currency devaluations in Latin America. It said currency swings globally had made its commodity costs 600 million euros ($659.5 million) more expensive this year, with a large part of that coming from Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Unilever also said the rise in palm oil and crude prices was driving up the cost of manufacturing skin cleansers and laundry detergents - product categories where it is the dominant player in many markets including Britain. The Tesco dispute and earnings report raised investor concerns about the strength of its business, pushing its shares down more than 6 percent. Trevor Green, head of UK Equities at Unilever shareholder Aviva Investors, expressed confidence in CEO Paul Polman's team, telling Reuters they had done a good job of balancing price and volume growth over the past seven years. Another Unilever investor, Swiss asset management firm GAM, said the fall in sales volumes was tolerable for now. "If it's a quarter or two quarters, I'm not worried," GAM fund manager Xavier Van Hove said. "If it persists for more than four quarters, then yes, I would start to worry."

News Hampton Economic development chief: sell the localities, not the region Ryan MurphyContact ReporterRmurphy@dailypress.com Privacy Policy Officials have long acknowledged that Hampton Roads needs to diversify its economic base, but the new head of the region's economic development alliance says localities need to differentiate themselves from one another as well. Rick Weddle, who started as CEO of the Hampton Roads Economic Development Alliance in April, told the Hampton Economic Development Authority Tuesday morning that a homogenous regional model isn't going to get more companies to move to Hampton Roads. "Everyone has been worried about regional identity, what the name is, not so much what the value proposition is," Weddle said. "The real value proposition is the value of these diverse, distinctive community brands. I think we need to build those up." He likened the idea to companies like General Motors or Procter & Gamble, which sell an array of products, each with its own strong brand identity. In the same way, he said, Hampton Roads localities should not try to sell a single regional brand, but rather figure out the strengths of each locality and market those instead. His pitch comes at a time when the region has been lagging behind comparable metro areas in recovering from the 2008 recession. In a presentation to the HREDA, Weddle pointed to several peer regions that returned to pre-recession jobs levels within an average of five years.

Jordan CEO John Lawson talks about encourging his employees to become involved in the community. Hampton Roads is looking at December 2018 — 11 years since the start of the recession — until it returns to those peak job numbers, Weddle said. "And that's only if we get on track. If we don't get busy doing what needs to get done, it could be a dozen years, it could be 15 years," Weddle said. Getting back on track would mean not only a firm plan of how to pitch Newport News, Hampton and the region's nine other localities to businesses across the nation and world, but also the ability to bring that plan to bear. "We've been kind of in decision congestion, decision gridlock. … There's so much traffic you can't figure out what lane you need to be in to get out of the roundabout," he said. "We need to move from analysis into action. We need to move from the conflict of seeing our differences as problems and see them as opportunities." Q&A: Economic development heavyweight takes on Hampton Roads Tara Bozick Rick Weddle hit the ground running as the new president and CEO of the Hampton Roads Economic Development Alliance in April. During his 36-year economic development career, Weddle helped bring thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in investment to Orlando, Fla., as head of the Orlando Economic... Rick Weddle hit the ground running as the new president and CEO of the Hampton Roads Economic Development Alliance in April. During his 36-year economic development career, Weddle helped bring thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in investment to Orlando, Fla., as head of the Orlando Economic... (Tara Bozick) To get there, Weddle said the HREDA needs more money – about 31 percent more than its current budget, or more than $715,000. He said that would bring it back up to a pre-recession funding level and the additional money would all be funneled into marketing and research, not salaries or overhead. He's not asking local governments to foot the bill — at least, not yet. The HREDA is a public-private partnership funded at about a three-to-one split between public agencies and private investors. He said the regional alliance would aim for 58,000 new jobs for Hampton Roads over the next five years, including 19,000 jobs in advanced industries — but it needs a hefty budget hike to do it. The challenge now, Weddle said, is convincing local businesses that helping the HREDA is helping themselves. One issue Weddle flags locally, which doesn't sound like a problem at first, is a high "closure rate" — a measure of how many of the businesses that take a serious look at Hampton Roads end up coming here. Regionally, Hampton Roads has around a 50 percent closure rate. That sounds good, but Weddle says the opposite is true – that the region should be getting a lot more serious looks than it is. "You're not going to close 80 or 90 percent. The only way to get that (number of new projects) up is to get more in the pipeline," he said. "In my experience, 35 years in this business, once a good plan is under way, you'll see a closure rate more in the 12, 18, 20 percent range." Rather than 10 major projects a year, he argued a region this size should be seeing 15 or 20 with more than 100 serious looks from businesses. Murphy can be reached by phone at 757-247-4760.

Most Popular The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. Duracell Star Wars Credit: Duracell via YouTube The next "Star Wars" flick is still more than eight weeks away, but the brand hype has begun. Duracell is out with a 60-second ad tied to the Dec. 16 release of "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" and a tie in to a charitable sponsorship of Children's Miracle Network. The ad from Anomaly for the battery brand, sold earlier this year by Procter & Gamble Co. to Berkshire Hathaway, shows a small detachment of child space rebels spreading cheer to a girl in a hospital. It backs a program through which Duracell will donate $100,000 and a million batteries for toys at 147 hospitals nationwide. "Star Wars toys are going to be the most iconic and culturally relevant toys of the year, so we are thrilled to be partnering with them," said Duracell Marketing Director Ramon Velutini. After visiting CMN hospitals, he said, "We saw firsthand the importance of imaginative play and the positive impact it can have on children." The campaign will run throughout the holidays across TV and online, with a Children's Miracle Network voiceover. Other marketers planning "Rogue One" integrations include General Mills, Gillette, Nissan and Verizon. For the second time this year, Axe has featured a winner of "RuPaul's Drag Race," this time featuring Alaska, winner of season 2 of the Logo network series, in an ad that ran during an Oct. 13 airing of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars. Alaska makes an appearance starting at second :14 of a revised 30-second version of the brand's "Find Your Magic" anthem ad from 72andSunny, which originally broke in January and ran on the Super Bowl, as part of what the brand says is its "inclusive take on masculinity." Axe also featured the winner of recently concluded season eight of the series, Christopher Caldwell, a.k.a. Bob the Drag Queen, immediately after his coronation in May. Tecate's beer wall ad -- which debuted during the first presidential debate -- has an approval rating that would make Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton jealous. The spot, which will air again tonight during coverage of the third and final debate, makes light of Mr. Trump's proposal to build a wall along the Mexican border. Despite the partisan overtones, the ad is playing well across America. It has been viewed 50 million times, including TV and digital, attaining an 86% positive sentiment score, according to Heineken USA. "Everyone got the idea that it is a Mexican brand that brews on the border and they are just going back to their roots," said Heineken USA Chief Marketing Officer Nuno Teles. More from the beer beat: What happens when a big brewer acquires a craft beer brand? You see more deals like the one MillerCoors just inked with the Atlanta Braves. The brewer this week announced that its newly acquired Terrapin brand will be the flagship craft beer at SunTrust Park, the new Braves stadium opening next year. MillerCoors took a majority interest in Athens, Ga.-based Terrapin Beer Company earlier this year. Craft brands typically don't have the budgets to ink big sports sponsorship deals. But under MillerCoors, Terrapin is going big with the Braves. The deal includes a taproom and microbrewery called Terrapin Taproom that will operate from a mixed use development called The Battery that is adjacent to SunTrust Park. From beer to pizza: In its first big push as the official pizza partner of the NCAA, Pizza Hut has a job for the ultimate NCAA sports fan. Pizza Hut is scouting for a fan to attend as many Division I NCAA championships as he or she can during the 2016-17 season. The winner, along with all expenses paid, will bring home $50,000 for the mid-November through early July gig. It's "a dream job for a college sports fan," said David Daniels, VP-media and advertising, Pizza Hut. Pizza Hut NCAA All-American Credit: Pizza Hut Of course, March Madness viewing parties are a key time for pizza sales. But the Pizza Hut All-American will also get to some of the more obscure title games, perhaps including fencing and bowling. "These don't get in the limelight very often," Mr. Daniels said. Pizza Hut has plans to promote itself at roughly 90 NCAA championships this school year, but will not be activating at the national championship for football, given the FBS is managed separately. Still, Pizza Hut can call itself the official pizza of college football as part of its multi-year deal. It is a return of sorts for Pizza Hut, which was the NCAA's official pizza partner during the 1990s. More recently, rival Domino's held that spot from 2011 to 2013. In other restaurant news, Red Robin, known to many for its bottomless fries, is placing a marketing bet on another side item: the onion ring. The chain's new "Let's Burger" campaign is its first big work under Senior VP-Chief Marketing Officer Jonathan Muhtar, who joined at the end of 2015. "'Let's Burger' is a departure from Red Robin's previous advertising approach and is intended to be more inclusive for all targets -- men, moms, millennials and multicultural," Mr. Muhtar said. The campaign includes a satirical spin on burger-related news called The Onion Ring, the chain's first association with The Onion and its Onion Labs division. Deb Maltzman, creative director and copywriter at Red Robin's agency of record, KBS, said the agency and the marketer were trying to do content in a way that stood out from what competition is doing. The Onion Ring microsite includes original content. The campaign is set to run at least through the end of the 2016. The Onion Ring Homepage Credit: Red Robin On to a healthier topic: Blue Cross Blue Shield Association is running a new campaign called "Fearless Nation" that tackles overall fitness issues like flossing and getting enough sleep. It includes seven digital videos and is part of the the "Live Fearless" effort the Chicago-based health insurer developed three years ago. "We wanted to create something that takes the idea of being healthy and makes it fun so people would engage with it," said Cynthia Rolfe, VP-marketing and brand at Blue Cross. The organization worked with McGarryBowen on the new push. "We wanted to go beyond the 'take the stairs' messages we've seen a million times," said Mike Wegener, creative director at McGarryBowen, noting that staging real-life stunts allowed the brand to capture "watchable stories that also happen to be educational." Apex Clearing Corp. ad Credit: Finsbury Financial custodian Apex Clearing Corp. is advertising its first work from Finsbury, which the Dallas-based firm began working with over a month ago. The digital, cheeky campaign features a personal ad designed to attract hedge funds who are no longer working with prime brokers like Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan. "Dumped by your mortgage broker?" the ad reads, before listing the assets of Apex's recently launched prime brokerage offering. This is the four-year-old Apex's first time advertising. Lastly, some hiring news: In time for toy season, GoldieBlox is ramping up its personnel starting with the hire of Kenny Davis as chief marketing officer. The toymaker promotes STEM skills -- science, technology, engineering and maths -- for girls. Mr. Davis joins the four-year-old toy brand from Hasbro. He plans to use his 20-year knowledge of the industry on new intellectual property products like TV shows, video games and toys. GoldieBlox has also hired Jenna Boyd from Nickelodeon as chief content officer and Jennifer Rahardjanoto from Mattel as creative director. GoldieBlox is planning a new book series with Random House and recently launched a coding app. Contributing: Jack Neff, Adrianne Pasquarelli, E.J.

Hearts & Science, a New York City marketing agency, was formed this spring after media giant Omnicom Group won the Procter & Gamble account. Several months later, the new unit landed AT&T. In a blink, it seemed, a startup had won the media buying business for the nation’s two largest advertisers. Combined, the giants spend over $4 billion on measured media. Hearts & Science recently opened a shop in downtown Dallas, across the street from AT&T headquarters. Over 30 employees are in place with plans to have over 100 by year end, the company said. The rapid ascension of an all-new agency says something about the state of advertising and AT&T. Both are changing rapidly and trying to capitalize on the dramatic shift to more digital and mobile technology. Refuse to pay for video? AT&T hopes new streaming options turn you on More customers watch video on phones and through video streaming services, and listen to radio on the internet. Reaching those audiences requires more than broadcast TV ads. At the same time, AT&T is expanding into streaming entertainment and creating original content. Those initiatives are about to ramp up as AT&T continues to build its DirecTV franchise. “We were looking for a media agency that really understands the new marketing landscape,” said Fiona Carter, AT&T’s senior vice president for brand marketing, advertising and sponsorships. AT&T's Fiona Carter says "liberating the data" about consumers can help create more effective advertising. DANIEL EUBANK EyeCapturePhoto Hearts & Science recruited top leaders from Omnicom and other ad agencies, and they have strong relationships with Facebook, Snapchat and LinkedIn, she said.  The agency collects data on what customers are watching, listening to and talking about. That  will tell AT&T where to put its message -- which programs, platforms and apps. But AT&T also wanted to bridge the usual gap between media planners and the creatives who dream up campaigns. This was seen as a chance to integrate data analysis, media buying and creative. Hearts & Science will collaborate with BBDO, the Omnicom creative agency that also landed AT&T work. Better feedback, in near real time, is expected to be more effective and efficient. “I call it liberating the data,” Carter said. “It can inform the creative work in ways that haven’t been done before.” Carter joined AT&T a year ago, after working over a decade at BBDO in New York and briefly at its Omnicom parent. When Hearts & Science launched in April, it was described as a data-driven marketing agency with media planning and buying, and other services. To build a new kind of agency, it’s recruiting people who don’t usually work in advertising, said Tara Levine, chief experience officer. That includes data scientists, management consultants and analysts in finance and statistics. Embedding those experts with the creatives will produce better insights, she said. “There’s a tendency to think the only creative work comes out of creative agencies,” Levine said. “But a lot of creativity and innovation can be data driven. It can make a big difference when you have data at your fingertips.” Dallas-based AT&T launches DirecTV app that streams live TV, recorded shows To some local players, this idea doesn’t sound revolutionary. Digital marketing generates a growing share of most advertising budgets already, and data analytics have grown with it. Last year, digital accounted for over 40 percent of revenue at ad agencies, according to Advertising Age. That’s up from about a quarter of revenue in 2009. The challenge is harnessing the big data that comes from digital, said Russel Wohlwerth, principal of External View Consulting Group in Los Angeles. He said Hearts & Science is connecting the dots by using data science and intuition. And then melding creatives, media buyers and analysts. “You can’t look only at the numbers,” he said. “Every media agency is taking note, trying to figure out the secret sauce.” Carter said it's valuable for Hearts & Science to open an office in Dallas. The ad business is moving so fast that it helps to walk over and tackle problems immediately. “It’s great to sit side-by-side and work on all that together,” she said. The Richards Group founder discusses 'shock' of losing Chick-Fil-A ad campaign The expansion also represents a boost for an industry dealing with disruption. Ad agencies often face tight budgets, intense competition and more frequent client reviews. This summer, the Richards Group in Dallas lost the Chick-fil-A account after 22 years. That was despite great success in creating a brand identity around the "Eat Mor Chikin" campaign. Such turnover is a sign of the times in advertising. In recent years, an unprecedented number of accounts have been put up for agency review. Both AT&T and Procter & Gamble walked away from long-time engagements to sign with Hearts & Science. Clients are trying to both cut costs and connect with a young audience. Instead of 30-second TV spots, some are making inroads with longer segments that are more entertaining. AT&T created a series about high school students, Summer Break, that’s run for four seasons. AT&T products and services are embedded in the story, and the series is on YouTube. That's not advertising in the traditional sense. “We’re trying to create video that stops you from scrolling through,” Carter said. “That’s the right kind of content for the digital generation.” View Comments Tags Business Dallas AT&T Commentary Share Facebook Twitter Email Print This Story Get the Most Important D-FW News in Your Inbox Sign up for our daily email newsletters Get Headlines, Business, SportsDay, and GuideLive.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Lisa Rein October 19 Follow @Reinlwapo Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, left, and former House speaker Newt Gingrich during a campaign rally in Cincinnati in July. (John Minchillo/Associated Press) Former Republican House speaker Newt Gingrich, a leading adviser to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, is urging the candidate to take on a thorny issue if he’s elected: Overhaul the civil service so it’s easier to fire bad apples. The idea goes to the heart of Republican frustration with what some derisively refer to as federal workers’ lifetime tenure. Republican proposals in Congress to cut benefits and punish wrongdoing have picked up steam in recent years following scandals over veterans’ care, lavish conference spending and IRS scrutiny of tax-exempt groups. But a major push to make changes to how the federal workforce is managed would run into fierce political opposition in Washington. [House tries again to give Veterans Affairs more power to discipline employees] Democrats are generally allies of the public employee unions that represent the 2 million civil servants, and they resist GOP proposals to chip away at their pensions and job protections. Nonetheless, Gingrich is urging Trump to make the performance of the federal workforce a priority, making a case for why it should be easier to fire poor performers and those with records of misconduct. Under current law, it’s difficult to do. Gingrich spoke with The Washington Post Tuesday afternoon about why he’s telling Trump that better management of federal workers is so important. The conversation has been lightly edited for clarity. Q. Why should federal employees be on the radar of a President Trump so quickly? A. You have a story in USA Today today [about new leadership] at VA. You have Bob McDonald, the VA secretary, who was a pretty good CEO, but he’s now so absorbed by the [federal] bureaucracy that he accepts things he never would have accepted when he ran Procter & Gamble. He suggested that 90 percent of VA medical centers have new leadership. Actually there are eight people hired from outside the agency, out of 140 medical center directors. So that’s not quite 6 percent. The rest have just been moved around. Q. So you’re saying that some VA managers who did not do their jobs should have been fired but weren’t? And that’s the problem in government? A.  That’s a large part of what’s wrong. If you read President Obama’s comments when he appointed [former VA secretary Eric] Shinseki, the president said VA is a broken agency and we have to fix it. Now years later you come down to an agency filled with failure to achieve things. One out of three suicide prevention lines goes over to voice mail. That’s criminal behavior. And yet until were prepared to reform the civil service model — and the Pendleton Act [which established the civil service] passed 133 years ago — you have no ability to fire people who are really bad. Q. Okay, so why is it so hard to fire bad apples in government? A. Attitudinally, you have to ask that question. Why? In a private-sector company if you have someone who fudged 3,000 appointments for veterans so the hospital would look like it worked better, you say, who was accountable? Who got fired? Who went to jail? Dumping 3,000 names ought to be illegal. The quagmire is so bad. It’s a very simple watershed: Should the president, through his appointees, have the power to fire people who are corrupt? We think you’ve done bad things, and now you pay the penalty. The threshold question is: How sick does the system have to get for you to admit it has to be reformed? Q. What has Trump’s reaction been when you press him to make this issue a priority? A. He’s talking about it a little bit. I think it’s actually a very good place to draw a contrast with Hillary. I would not be at all surprised to see [Trump make] a speech on reforming the whole civil service system. Q. Would change like this to how government is managed be possible in Washington? Where would the fault lines be? A. So there are two groups in Washington on this issue who are initially opposed. First, you have the hard-line federal employee unions. They’re like the teachers union in New York. There are parallels. They are the group that, no matter how sick it is, they have a vested interest in the old order. Then there are people who know better and are embarrassed, but they think the fight will be so big they can’t bring themselves to take it on. Chairman [Jeff] Miller (R-Fla.) in the House, he, more than the Senate leaders, has been much more willing to take on the unions and offer real reform on veterans issues. The Democrats start from a premise of: We can’t touch any of this. We had the first big fundraiser for Scott Walker [the GOP governor who moved to limit collective bargaining for public employees] in Wisconsin. The minute they passed reforms, there were literally death threats again him and his wife. If Trump were to win, you would have this. This will not be a problem for Hillary, as she will take care of the unions. Q. So the Democrats are satisfied with the status quo? Do they get a lot of money from federal unions? A. It’s money, but it’s also numbers. If you’re a member of Congress from the Washington suburbs, guess who you listen to? Q. So what happened with these issues when you were House speaker in the 1990s? A. We passed administrative reform acts, but at the time, frankly, of all the things we were trying to do, we didn’t pivot on reforming the civil service. It was only after I was out of office advising people in the (George W.) Bush administration that I began to realize if you don’t fix this problem, nothing in government is going to work. Q. Why is it so important that, to use your word, bad employees are forced out? A. As the system continues to decay, if you have a system which defends incompetence with bad people, then good people will leave. The system gets sicker and sicker. Right after World War II, the U.S. government was an amazing system. Q. Would government service improve if incompetent workers or those who really messed up had to go? A. Everyone benefits. You can actually do something. A person who actually got the VA fixed could point to veterans getting better health care. Or you reform NASA so it’s focused on actually getting into space, and you would have the advantage of a lot more achievements in space. At DOD [the Defense Department] you would cut through all of the planning and procurement baloney that’s just killing us. Q. So now you’re saying that government moves slowly. What’s the connection with poor performers? A. They’re mutually tied together. They’re two parallel questions. If you have too much bureaucracy, it has to justify itself. All the bureaucrats with nothing to do slow things down so they have nothing to do. Eisenhower’s national security council was made up of 24 people, I think. Now it’s about 500. Do we really think the national strategic decisions made by the Eisenhower administration were less important than those made today?

"We've sliced audiences far too thin," according to Zak Treuhaft, president of Hearts & Science, the OMG-owned, data-driven marketing agency originally set up to handle P&G's $2.6bn media business. "If I go to a creative agency and say 'I have 400 segments, each one of which will receive a completely different message', no creative a) wants that assignment or b) can likely find 400 different versions of an ad for 400 different targets," he told Beet.tv. "I think we'll find a nice equilibrium where there are slightly different spins on slightly different campaigns and creativity will live across multiple screens in different ways, but not all the way to N equals a million," he added. Up to now, he suggested, the danger has been that the industry becomes obsessed by the tools at its disposal, rather like the proverbial child in a candy store. He also observed a parallel between cross-screen addressability and the early days of digital advertising. "First into the boat will be people who can very easily model out and attribute direct sales to their message," he said – typically categories such as automotive, travel & tourism and electronics that involve high cost and high consideration and where "far down the funnel there's an intense need to address a very specific person". But he expected that cross-screen addressable advertising would become the norm for all categories "as the value of the data that lives inside that campaign becomes more widely understood and more easily scaled". The notion of balance also extends to the way that cross-screen addressability allows marketers to adjust campaigns depending on the outcome sought. "Part of the promise of addressable is that it allows you to tune and target whatever work you're doing with a lot greater fidelity," Treuhaft said. "If you're looking for more efficient it work it allows you to reinvest more dollars in other parts of your marketing programs or elsewhere – that's where the promise of addressable lives."

In 1947 Valerie, the wife of an Army officer, was living in Camberley, Surrey, and expecting her third child. She was not looking forward to the prospect of washing, ironing and drying the traditional towelling nappies which were all that were available at the time.  “I just didn’t want to wash them,” she told an interviewer last year. “You had to iron them as well. It was awful labour. I was amazed you couldn’t buy a disposable version. I enquired of the US and you couldn’t buy them there. It was extraordinary.”  So she decided she had better do something about it herself.  Valerie Hunter Gordon with her daughter Frances After a certain amount of trial and error (initially she used old nylon parachutes, of which there were many spare after the war), and drawing on her considerable needlework skills, she came up with a pair of adjustable PVC waterproof pants fastened with poppers, with a cord around the waist, which could be wiped clean, or washed and bleached. Into these she slipped a pad of cellulose wadding with a thin layer of cotton wool next to the baby’s skin to prevent soreness. The waterproof pants prevented leakage and were shaped to ensure that the pad remained in position without safety pins. Unlike modern all-in-one disposable nappies, Valerie’s design meant that only the biodegradable dirty pads were disposed of, while the waterproof pants could be rinsed and used again. This  system created very little permanent waste; it also significantly reduced the water and electricity consumption associated with washing cotton nappies.  Design for the Paddi nappy Credit: Universal News (Europe) The nappies were a huge success on her baby son Nigel and she soon began taking orders from the wives of other senior officers at Staff College in Camberley. “My husband used to cut out the pads on the floor of the attic when he came home from work and I used to run them up with my mother’s old sewing machine... I would go out for tea with the wives and babies, and they would say, 'Oh Valerie, wouldn’t you make one for me?’ It became a full-time job. It was more hard work than washing the damn things.”   The old Singer sewing machine remained in regular use in her children’s nursery until the final years of her life. Of the pre-PVC prototypes, Valerie ended up making some 400 pairs of plastic pants in her kitchen from parachute nylon and other experimental materials and selling them for five shillings each. In 1948 she and her husband applied for a patent. A breakthrough came when Valerie Hunter Gordon’s father, Sir Vincent de Ferranti, met Sir Robert Robinson, a director of Robinsons of Chesterfield, manufacturer of old-fashioned women’s sanitary belts, and told him about his daughter’s invention.  In 1949, when the family moved to Inverness-shire, Robinsons agreed to start manufacturing the nappies. The pants were patented as a “Paddi”, while the “Paddi Pad” throw-away inserts were made a registered design. An early advertisement for the Paddi Credit: Peter Jolly/Northpix They were not an immediate success. In the frugal postwar years many women found the disposable element of the Paddi wasteful and extravagant, but the idea began to catch on and the product was featured in the Ideal Home Exhibition in 1952.  The BBC then featured the Paddi as one of the six most innovative items of the year and by the end of that year 750,000 packs had been sold. By 1960 sales had reached six million and the royalties contributed to the Hunter Gordons’  increasing household expenditure (they went on to have three more children). Valerie Hunter Gordon travelled up and down the country to the Robinsons headquarters in Chesterfield, fine-tuning designs for Paddi and, later on, designing other products including a similar product for women, the Nikini (with “Nikini Pads”), based on the Paddi concept. Rather to her surprise the Nikini earned more royalties overall than the Paddi, though as she reflected, “there are probably more menstruating women in the world than incontinent babies.” The Paddi brand went into decline in the 1960s with the arrival of Proctor and Gamble’s all-in-one disposable nappy, Pampers. Robinsons fought back with Paddi Cosifits, but were unable to unable to invest sufficiently in marketing to compete with the American product. While the Paddi’s PVC pants could be reused, the Pads were disposable, so few examples of the product in their unused, pristine form still exist. The V&A possesses a pack “found in the donor’s mother’s attic”, observing that “due to their ephemeral nature [they] are quite rare.” Valerie Hunter Gordon with her children (from left to right) Alison, Nigel and Hugh Credit: Universal News (Europe) Valerie Ziani de Ferranti was born at Baslow, Derbyshire, on December 7 1921, the daughter of Sir Vincent de Ferranti and Dorothy Hettie Wilson. Her grandfather, the inventor Sebastian de Ferranti, was the founder of the eponymous family electrical engineering company. She attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart, Woldingham, and in 1940 married Patrick Hunter Gordon, then a lieutenant in the Royal Engineers, who had won an MC earlier in the year after blowing up a bridge under heavy gunfire during the retreat to Dunkirk. He suffered post-traumatic illness and Valerie Hunter Gordon unflaggingly supported him over years of investigation and treatment, shielding her children from crises and developing her products all the while.  She was lunching with Lord Lovat when he joked that her two daughters, in identical tartan dresses, looked like sponge bags In 1959 she designed the family’s hi-tech house in Inverness-shire. It featured electric self-closing curtains and sophisticated heating systems. She constructed a magnificent garden and would do the weeding in an old raincoat she referred to as her “mink”. Valerie Hunter Gordon was rarely satisfied with things as they were; she liked to make improvements. She did not believe, for example, that you could only have one Scottish tartan. She was lunching with Lord Lovat one day when he joked that her two daughters, dressed in identical Gordon tartan dresses, looked like sponge bags.  Determined to find an alternative pattern, she consulted the thread count registers collected by the Highland Society in the 19th century and reconstructed another tartan that was recorded as having been created by Gordon weavers.

The Enquirer/Madison Schmidt Buy Photo Winold Reiss created this mosaic for Union Terminal. It's now re-installed on the west face of the Duke Energy Convention Center. This is a scene from the Aeronautical Corp. of America, which built aircraft at Lunken Airport. (Photo: The Enquirer/Patrick Reddy)Buy Photo He was always larger than life. Even during it, even before artist Winold Reiss forever captured his likeness in the massive mosaic that towers above Central Avenue. John Hentz was a man of few words but many stories. Tales other people told, of course. They still do. And some of those stories – legends, really –  take different shapes depending on who is telling them today. Just take that whole matter of his eye. The one that couldn't see. For his oldest grandson, Don Beck, it was first a battle wound, a scar from his stint in his native Hungary's military. Later, relatives revealed it was actually a mishap with a pair of scissors that stole half of his vision. But Jean Beiting, his only granddaughter, heard whispers that the weapon was something else entirely: a particularly strong batch of his home-brewed wine. Buy Photo Grace Beck (left) talks with her sister-in-law, Jean Beiting, whose grandfather, John Hentz, is depicted working behind her.  (Photo: The Enquirer/Patrick Reddy) But strip away the myths, the murmurs and Hentz was a lot like anyone else living here in the first half of the 20th century. He worked hard and the work was hard. Took his coffee black and his beer cold. Loved to cheer on the Reds from the Crosley Field bleachers – almost as much as he loved to complain about manager Bill McKechnie. That must have been why Hentz caught the German-born artist’s eye when he visited American Oak Leather Co. in 1931, with his sketchbook and camera in hand. All the ways Hentz was common. One of us. That was Reiss's commission from the Union Terminal architects, after all. CINCINNATI.COM Council votes to support murals move With nickel-sized glass tiles and tinted mortar, he was to forge a sparkling monument to the city's laborers. By translating the daily grind into glittering tiles of 8,000 colors, he elevated the tired bodies and rough hands that built this city. These are "real people doing real work," said Cliff Radel, a former reporter who led an Enquirer project identifying the featured workers. All these years later, Hentz – and the 13 other works that are part of what's known as Reiss's industrial or worker murals – are still a symbol of this city. "They represent a lot of the greatness that makes Cincinnati the city that it is, in terms of industrial prowess," said City Manager Harry Black. "These murals capture the ambition, the innovation and the grit that makes Cincinnati what it is today." And as of Thursday, Hentz's depiction and eight other 20-by-20 foot pieces are officially back home. Buy Photo Nine murals created by Winold Reiss in the early 1930s for Union Terminal have been re-installed on the west face of the Duke Energy Convention Center. A dedication ceremony for the display happened Thursday.  (Photo: The Enquirer/Patrick Reddy) After decades hidden in shuttered terminals at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, nine of these 8-ton masterpieces are now on display on the exterior wall of the Duke Energy Convention Center along Central Avenue. Underneath the Cincinnati sign, men now cut soap in the Procter & Gamble factory again. Another butchers hogs at E. Kahn's & Sons just above the sidewalk. And don't miss the muscle-bound Hentz hunched over his leather roller at American Oak Leather. "They are works of art about the art of hard work," said Radel. And a lot of hard work went into the mural dedication at the convention center, too, he noted. Most recently, the move from CVG to Downtown took months and cost more than $2 million. And it required collaboration between the City of Cincinnati, Kenton County Airport Board in Kentucky and the Convention Facilities Authority of Hamilton County (CFA). But before that, community advocates toiled for decades to protect these nine precious and often displaced pieces of Cincinnati history. They were rescued, for the first time, when the murals moved to the airport in 1973. The Union Terminal train concourse displaying them was set to be demolished. The second save? After officials announced plans to raze the airport terminals, the city rallied to bring them back home. The timing of the celebration at Duke Energy Convention Center Thursday, however, recalled the very beginning of this Cincinnati story, before time and prestige made it history. It was Oct. 20, 1931, that Reiss was getting ready to come to Cincinnati, Radel said. Exactly 85 years ago. He had hotel reservations at the Netherland, just blocks from his murals today.

Trial opens for 15-year-old charged in killing of girl, 16 News Opinion Editorial An atmosphere of neglect Highlights from the third presidential debate of 2016 Highlights from Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's third and final debate before the Nov. 8 presidential election. Oct. 20, 2016.  Highlights from Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's third and final debate before the Nov. 8 presidential election. Oct. 20, 2016.  How did climate change get so ignored in the election? On Wednesday, Maryland lawmakers held a hearing to learn more about an issue of pressing fiscal importance: climate change. A few hours later and 2,500 miles away, the two leading candidates for president engaged in a debate in which the issue was treated as no more than an afterthought. Not only was a question about climate change absent from the stage in Las Vegas but it was never raised in the previous two presidential debates either. How climate change could be regarded as so irrelevant to the presidential contest yet so crucial to state government finances says a lot about the national state of denial and neglect over the harmful effects of man-made greenhouse gas emissions. In Annapolis, what lawmakers heard is that Maryland needs to adjust the investments in the state's $45 billion pension portfolio to minimize its carbon footprint. Why? Not because of some bleeding-heart desire to make the planet a slightly better place (although applying ethical considerations to investment decisions deserves proper consideration, too) but because the future profitability of greenhouse gas polluters looks dismal. That's right, on strictly a dollar and cents calculation, Maryland needs to divest from big polluters like coal, oil, large manufacturing and other companies that rely on fossil fuels. That shouldn't come as too great a shock. Coal mining companies have been filing for bankruptcy faster than Donald Trump's Atlantic City casinos did a decade ago. Other large pension holders have been adding climate change risk experts to manage their portfolios for the same reason. And it isn't just pensions. The adverse effects of climate change have been worrying Wall Street for years. As a recent report notes, insurance companies — property and casualty firms, in particular — have been fretting about worsening climate change risks. As global warming leads to more catastrophic weather, the danger of huge payouts to policyholders has increased, and they, like pensions and other big investors, are putting their money into renewables.

When the Republican nominee for president refused to say he would accept the results of the election, he rattled American democracy and openly flirted with the notion of a contested transition of power. He overshadowed an otherwise... (KATHLEEN HENNESSEY) The list of corporations that are making strategic decisions about their future with an eye to climate change reads like the Dow Jones Industrial Index: Walmart, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Starbucks, Goldman Sachs and on and on. This isn't just some public relations move; farsighted executives see a huge advantage in steering their businesses toward a reduced carbon footprint, either through less energy consumption or greater use of less polluting forms of energy as temperatures rise. Trump, Clinton trade caustic barbs as roast turns bitter JONATHAN LEMIRE The annual Alfred E.

Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, a white-tie gala in New York that is often the last time the two presidential nominees share a stage before Election Day, is traditionally a time when campaign hostilities are set aside. Not this year. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton traded... (JONATHAN LEMIRE) Yet despite this surge of activity within corporate leadership and investment communities, the presidential contenders can't be asked over the length of four and a half hours of debate about what the federal government should be doing? Shame on the various moderators for not insisting that Mr. Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speak directly on such a critically important topic. It's an embarrassment to journalism that the closest anyone got to a climate question was the one about energy-related jobs offered by red-sweater-enthusiast Ken Bone. As it happens, the candidates' positions are no secret. Mr. Trump has said he is not a "big believer" in man-made climate change (even describing it on Twitter as a Chinese hoax) and has attacked the Obama administration's efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Ms. Clinton believes the problem is real and a threat to the nation's security. She has supported international agreements to limit emissions (saying in her Democratic nomination acceptance speech that she was proud to have helped shape them) and has pledged to accelerate clean energy deployment. Granted, Maryland's pension investments aren't going to drive national, let alone global, policy on climate change. But it's certainly prudent to make smarter investments, a choice made easier if corporations were required to publicly reveal more about their carbon footprints. That kind of Wall Street reform is not just socially responsible, it's something investors ought to demand. And who should lead the way? That's the proper role of a U.S. president — to not only seek legislative and regulatory relief but to use the bully pulpit of his or her position to call attention to this enormous environmental threat and rally public support behind reasonable solutions. For the record, one candidate appears qualified and prepared to do so and one does not.

REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo 1/2 left right The logo of the Unilever group is seen at the Miko factory in Saint-Dizier, France, May 4, 2016. REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo 2/2 By Martinne Geller | LONDON LONDON Unilever's push to raise the prices of its brands in Britain in response to a fall in the pound exposed the vulnerabilities of a company - and wider consumer brands industry - that can no longer count on selling more goods to deliver revenue growth. Consumer goods companies have been grappling with slowing volume sales over the past year, hit by falling household spending across the world, fierce competition from retailers' own-brand products and economic weakness in emerging markets. The pound's plunge since the June Brexit vote has put extra pressure on firms like Unilever (ULVR.L), whose brands include Marmite yeast spread and Dove soap, by driving up the cost of their imports to Britain and dollar-traded commodities. Last week the Anglo-Dutch company tried to raise the prices of a range of products by 10 percent in Britain, prompting a stand-off with the country's largest supermarket, Tesco (TSCO.L), which balked at the demand. The dispute - which showed an early effect of Britain's decision to leave the EU - was quickly resolved, but gave the public a rare glimpse into the difficult discussions that industry sources say are happening across the sector. An executive at one of Unilever's main rivals said it was also discussing possible price increases with UK supermarkets. A source at another rival said it faced the same pressures as Unilever but that it was not yet ready to raise prices and first wanted to exhaust cost-cutting options. Spirits company Pernod Ricard (PERP.PA) told Reuters it was planning price increases in Britain too. The Unilever row illustrated how reliant the company is on price rises - rather than increased volume sales - to make more money from shoppers around the world and how difficult that strategy may be to keep up, even as volatile currency and commodity environments drive up costs. The day "Marmitegate" dominated the front pages of British newspapers, the company reported a 3.2 percent rise in quarterly sales - with a 0.4 percent drop in the number of goods sold comfortably offset by a 3.6 percent increase in prices. It is not alone among its peers in this trend of slowing volumes and rising prices. This could put the sector on course for a long battle with big retailers like British supermarkets, which conversely need high sales volumes because of their tight margins and fixed costs, and low prices due to fierce competition in the domestic market. How this conflict might play out is unclear, with the Tesco row perhaps just a taste of what is to come. French food group Danone (DANO.PA), which makes Activia yoghurt and Aptamil baby formula, reported a 0.7 percent fall in third-quarter volumes this week but, like Unilever, used price increases to drive a 2.1 percent rise in sales. Britain's Reckitt Benckiser's (RB.L), which does not break down its sales by volumes and price rises, reported its weakest quarterly growth in over five years on Wednesday. Nestle (NESN.S) also posted its weakest sales growth in more than a decade on Thursday, with volumes slowing. Procter & Gamble (PG.N) reports results next week. Unilever, Reckitt and P&G all declined to comment on any future plans for price increases, while Danone did not respond to a request for comment. WHY UNILEVER? Unilever is the No. 1 supplier of ice cream, deodorants, bath and shower products and margarines and spreads in many countries, and has invested in marketing and brand innovation over the years, which gives it pricing power. But industry experts said the company's request for 10 percent price rises in Britain was aggressive, and that they did not expect its rivals to demand such high increases. "We think all UK food producers are going to need price increases in the next few months but we can't see 10 percent," said Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo. "Unilever's pricing strategy does seem to be about as aggressive as it could be." Unilever said its reliance on price increases was largely down to factors including weak consumer demand in emerging markets and the sharp devaluation of Latin American currencies. It is more exposed to these regions than most of its peers. Emerging markets as a whole account for almost 60 percent of its sales, with Latin America generating 16 percent of sales. Much of the company's third-quarter price rises were to offset currency devaluations in Latin America. It said currency swings globally had made its commodity costs 600 million euros ($659.5 million) more expensive this year, with a large part of that coming from Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. Unilever also said the rise in palm oil and crude prices was driving up the cost of manufacturing skin cleansers and laundry detergents - product categories where it is the dominant player in many markets including Britain. The Tesco dispute and earnings report raised investor concerns about the strength of its business, pushing its shares down more than 6 percent. Trevor Green, head of UK Equities at Unilever shareholder Aviva Investors, expressed confidence in CEO Paul Polman's team, telling Reuters they had done a good job of balancing price and volume growth over the past seven years. Another Unilever investor, Swiss asset management firm GAM, said the fall in sales volumes was tolerable for now. "If it's a quarter or two quarters, I'm not worried," GAM fund manager Xavier Van Hove said. "If it persists for more than four quarters, then yes, I would start to worry."

Quarterly revenue rose by a mere 0.2 percent on an organic basis to 2.32 billion euros ($2.55 billion), held back by the previously-flagged loss of large media accounts in the United States in 2015, but also missing the forecast by a Reuters poll of analysts that predicted growth of 0.97 percent. Publicis Chief Executive Officer Maurice Levy said full-year organic growth in 2017 will be higher than in 2016, but pointed to the economic uncertainties following the British vote to leave the European Union, and surrounding the U.S. presidential election next month. Shares were falling by 5.95 percent at 0808 GMT, on track for their worst day in four-and-a-half months, making Publicis the worst-performer of the French CAC 40 stock index. Publicis shares are up 2.7 percent since January. * Nine-month revenue rose 1.9 percent on an organic basis to 7.07 billion euros * Publicis confirmed full-year guidance for 2016 * The advertising group, the world's third-largest, gained clients such as Wal-Mart, P&G's home care products, Coty and USAA. * Management board will propose to bring forward the 2018 target of a 42 percent payout to 2016. * Levy said total acquisitions in 2017 should be lower than 500 million euros. * Levy, who is slated to leave his position as CEO in 2017, confirmed that the board would make a decision on his successor in February 2017. * Levy said he was ready to take another position in the company's corporate governance to assure a smooth transition, if the board asked him to do so. * American Rival Omnicom said this week that its third-quarter organic sales growth was 3.2 percent.

Quarterly revenue rose by a mere 0.2 percent on an organic basis to 2.32 billion euros ($2.55 billion), held back by the previously-flagged loss of large media accounts in the United States in 2015, but also missing the forecast by a Reuters poll of analysts that predicted growth of 0.97 percent. Publicis Chief Executive Officer Maurice Levy said full-year organic growth in 2017 will be higher than in 2016, but pointed to the economic uncertainties following the British vote to leave the European Union, and surrounding the U.S. presidential election next month. Shares were falling by 5.95 percent at 0808 GMT, on track for their worst day in four-and-a-half months, making Publicis the worst-performer of the French CAC 40 stock index. Publicis shares are up 2.7 percent since January. * Nine-month revenue rose 1.9 percent on an organic basis to 7.07 billion euros * Publicis confirmed full-year guidance for 2016 * The advertising group, the world's third-largest, gained clients such as Wal-Mart, P&G's home care products, Coty and USAA. * Management board will propose to bring forward the 2018 target of a 42 percent payout to 2016. * Levy said total acquisitions in 2017 should be lower than 500 million euros. * Levy, who is slated to leave his position as CEO in 2017, confirmed that the board would make a decision on his successor in February 2017. * Levy said he was ready to take another position in the company's corporate governance to assure a smooth transition, if the board asked him to do so. * American Rival Omnicom said this week that its third-quarter organic sales growth was 3.2 percent. UK-based WPP, the top advertising company in the world, will report third-quarter sales on Oct. 31, while Havas will do the same after market close on Oct. 25.

Third-quarter revenue missed analysts’ estimates, dragged down by the loss of U.S. media-buying accounts like Procter & Gamble Co. and Coca-Cola Co. in the past year. Some U.K. customers in finance and other segments have pulled back because the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union may hurt business. “We approach 2017 cautiously given the lack of visibility owing to elections in the U.S., France and Germany, and the consequences of Brexit,” for the U.K. and the rest of Europe, Maurice Levy, the company’s 74-year-old chief executive officer, said in a statement. Publicis, whose clients include Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Nestle SA, reported a 0.4 percent decline in sales, to 2.32 billion euros ($2.54 billion), below analysts’ average estimate of 2.33 billion euros. Organic growth, which strips out effects from acquisitions and currency swings, was 0.2 percent, bolstered by advances in digital business in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. The French company warned in April that it would be hit by the loss of several media-buying accounts during the following quarters. That effect has been compounded by projects recently completed at digital ad agency Razorfish, at a time when new ones haven’t reached their full potential yet, Levy said. Sales declined 4 percent in North America in organic terms in the third quarter. Publicis fell as much as 6.5 percent, on track for the biggest loss since Oct. 22, 2015. The stock was down 4.8 percent to 63.8 euros at 3:14 p.m. in Paris. In London, rival WPP Plc lost as much as 3.2 percent -- a read-through from the slump reported by Publicis and the weaker outlook, Charles Bedouelle, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said in an e-mail. At 0.2 percent, organic growth at Publicis was slightly below expectations, and the company’s comments on the fourth quarter and full-year 2017 were circumspect, Bedouelle said in a note to clients.  For more on Maurice Levy and Publicis succession, click here. Although Publicis has decided to keep all its operations in the U.K. following the country’s June 23 vote to leave the European Union, many customers are considering moving London-based operations to continental Europe, “notably in finance but not only,” Levy told reporters. “They are worried that a hard Brexit could close some doors to European markets. They are very cautious.” At recent roadshows and private discussions with the French broker, managers in global advertising have all highlighted their fear that the market was too complacent about Brexit and political risk, Exane BNP Paribas’s Bedouelle said. “None were really seeing major impact yet they were expecting it to hit in 2017,” Bedouelle said. Publicis said it will raise its dividend payout ratio to 42 percent in 2016 from 39.5 percent last year, achieving a target it originally set for 2018. Levy, who has led Publicis into the digital age, plans to step down next year after almost 30 years as CEO. The process of finding a successor will start in November and is expected to be completed by February. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The global 9-decanoic acid methyl ester market is expected to reach USD 240.0 million by 2025, according to a new report. Rising awareness regarding the use of green chemicals coupled with rapidly growing demand for esters in flavors & fragrances industry is likely to boost 9-decanoic acid methyl ester consumption in upcoming years. The increasing number of biorefineries to fulfill ever rising biodiesel and other bio-chemicals' demand is expected to trigger its production over the forecast period. The price for decanoic acid methyl esters is higher than its synthetic counterparts owing to the involvement of specialized processes such as metathesis, which require costly catalysts. Further, these processes are time and energy consuming which in turn leads to high production cost, thus pushing the overall price of product upwards. The flavors & fragrances application segment is predicted to gain traction over the forecast period. The ability of esters to impart fruity flavors is a key factor for their increasing demand in flavors and fragrances industry. The segment is likely to grow an estimated CAGR of 5.0% from 2016 to 2025. Further key findings from the report suggest: Pharmaceutical application segment is estimated to account for around 20% of the market demand in 2015. 9-DAME is used to manufacture hand cleaners, skin care lotions, shampoos, and other similar products. Asia Pacific is expected to be a key regional market over the forecast period owing to the high demand for flavors & fragrances. Asia Pacific has witnessed slightly lower prices on account of ample raw material availability. The introduction of biofuels directive and favorable regulations for bio-based products is expected to positively impact the 9-DAME market in Europe, making it the second largest regional market. Companies such as Elevance Renewable Sciences, P&G Chemicals, TCI (Shanghai) Development Co., Ltd have established themselves as manufacturers and suppliers in the industry. In September 2015, Thermo Fisher Scientific completed the acquisition of Alfa Aesar with an initiative to expand their laboratory offering portfolio. To maintain competency in the market, key market players in collaboration with value chain participants focus on developing new technology to manufacture green chemicals. Versalis and Elevance have entered into strategic partnership to develop a new metathesis technology to produce bio-chemicals from vegetable oils and will also design and construct a world-scale ethylene metathesis-based production plant that will utilize renewable oils in Italy Read the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p04230381-summary/view-report.html About Reportlinker ReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

By Josh Kolm October 19, 2016 Product discovery and review platform Influenster is opening an office in Toronto to create a more uniquely Canadian experience for both clients and users. More than two million members review products on the platform, particularly those in the CPG and health and beauty categories. In addition to posting their own reviews, users also discover new products by connecting with other consumers. Influenster also has an internal editorial team that produces content based around new product launches, or particular trends and themes. Brands that partner with Influenster can have samples of their products sent directly to members who are interested in a particular category, or represent a demographic or lifestyle the brand is looking to engage. Thanks to a recent partnership with Ebates earlier this year, which saw the online discount company invest $8 million into Influenster, members can also discover new products by receiving discounts on certain items. Aydin Acar, co-founder and CEO of Influenster, says the main thing that separates it from other review-centric sites like Amazon (which Influenster ranks behind, at number two, in terms of the total number of reviews) is it’s highly engaged user base. It also collects a great deal of data from members when they sign up, allowing it to target product samples to members more accurately. “On any given day, we have 35,000 new reviews come in from our members,” he says. “They ask each other questions and compare products based on their opinions, and we give them a platform to share their reviews and opinions with their own social networks. So not only are they more engaged, they become influencers when they share their content on their own.” Acar says opening a Canadian office was “no-brainer.” Roughly 10% of Influenster members are Canadian, and the company has been running campaigns here for clients including P&G, Keurig and L’Oréal since 2014 as an extension of its U.S. work. In addition to Toronto being a “hub” for start-ups and tech companies, Acar says there was a major demand from both existing clients and Canadian members to have a team on the ground here – instead of running campaigns from its head office in New York – so it could build more local insights and create a uniquely Canadian user experience. Trey Geiger will lead the Toronto office as director of business development. Prior to joining Influenster, Geiger held leadership positions at Vancouver tech company Keycafe, multi-channel network BroadbandTV and design studio Disruptive Media Publishers. The team in Canada will be small to start, with a total of five employees working in Toronto by the middle of next year.

To support Ad Age and the industry we cover please either: SUBSCRIBE or WHITELIST US Too Many Marketers Get Total Market Totally Wrong By Rochelle Newman-Carrasco. Published on October 19, 2016. Most Popular If I were to give last week's ANA 2016 Multicultural Marketing and Diversity Conference a title, it would be: "12 Steps to Cultural Competence and Confidence." Over three days in Los Angeles, industry leaders acknowledged that they are playing cultural catch up and recognized that, while well intended, misuse of the "total market" concept combining so-called mainstream plus diverse segments is suppressing culturally-specific voices and vision -- the very perspectives necessary for brands to make targeted consumer connections. A total market course correction is in order and Association of National Advertisers' CEO Bob Liodice wasted no time in bringing this concern to the forefront at the conference, attended by about 700 people. Mr. Liodice cited at least eight examples of "what happens when the industry gets together" -- pointing to ANA-led initiatives that have had an impact, from the Ad Council's consumer-facing social responsibility work to an industry-focused stop to digital ad fraud. In this spirit, Mr. Liodice announced the formation of The Association of Inclusive and Multicultural Marketing (AIMM), a coalition designed to "build a community of multicultural champions, advocates and experts." Gilbert Davila. Credit: Erin Becker Conference chair Gilbert Davila, president and CEO of Davila Multicultural Insights, and a founding AIMM board member, explained the coalition's goals: "Our intention is not to speak to the choir. With the support of ANA's executive leadership, we intend to elevate the conversation and bring it to corporate C-suites so that multicultural and inclusive marketing becomes the business imperative that it deserves to be." Lizette Williams, multicultural marketing leader at Kimberly-Clark, did not mince words when, during one of the first panels of the conference, she said, "Total market strategy has been largely misunderstood. Total market strategy was never intended to be a cost-cutting measure to drive efficiencies. It was actually quite the opposite. It was designed to drive inclusivity and effectiveness of messaging." Over the past few years, many marketers and agencies have been concocting their own total market scenarios, adopting the approach as a check-the-box strategy that brings to mind an old Total cereal slogan: "1 Bowl. 100%." In these cases, total market has really been more like a sugar substitute: all the taste of inclusiveness but only half the involvement. A few future-focused marketers, however, did understand total market as a "yes, and" proposition -- one that encouraged culturally insightful total and targeted ideas to take shape. You might say, these marketers went the Wheaties route, becoming total market champions by getting their strategies off to the right start with upfront investments in insights and with collaborative processes that nourished culturally attuned ecosystems. Never expecting a magical fix to a complex pursuit, these marketers set their priorities and re-engineered processes, not always succeeding but always learning and never turning back. And these were the marketing champions selected to share best practices at this year's ANA conference. Case studies consistently demonstrated the value of using a culturally specific lens in tandem with the wide-angle get-everyone-into-the-picture approach. Marketers underscored the importance of getting close to what consumers care about, particularly where social issues are concerned. No stranger to social causes, Macy's Director of Multicultural Customer Strategy, Maria Rios, shared a perspective that was echoed by fellow retailer Lane Bryant in a presentation on body equality. "The marketer is in a position to listen and lead," said Ms. Rios. "We can take conversations to places that align with brand values." Related Stories Coke, McDonald's, Toyota, Nestle Win ANA Multicultural Awards A Crisis Gone to Waste: Why Samsung Shouldn't Have Canceled ANA Presentation Procter & Gamble Commits to Saturday Morning Peace and Equality Initiative Why the Ad Industry's Diversity Strategy Needs a New Brief Ivan Pollard, Coca-Cola's SVP-strategic marketing, stated that brands need to stand "for something beyond themselves," adding that "millennials are demanding brands take a stand and support social causes." His Coca-Cola colleague Lauventria Robinson, VP-Multicultural Center of Excellence, moderated a compelling panel titled "Speak Up or Stay Silent" and focused on the role of brands regarding social injustice. Philanthropist and entrepreneur-artist Tyrese used a Titanic analogy to point out ways in which corporate America is "out of touch" and is suppressing the kind of diversity of thinking that could, in fact, keep brands from sinking. The conference closed with a powerful presentation by Saturday Morning, a coalition forged by advertising creatives in service to societal change. The tip of the iceberg isn't the problem. It's our fear of what lies below the surface and our resistance to facing that fear. What the ANA's Bob Liodice said bears repeating: "When our industry gets together we can …" With the content of this conference and AIMM, the new coalition, it seems marketers are ready to go deep, which would be aiming in the right direction.

To support Ad Age and the industry we cover please either: SUBSCRIBE or WHITELIST US Amid U.S. Marketing Push, Avon Hires Horizon Media as AOR By Lindsay Stein. Published on October 19, 2016. Avon's Credit: Avon Most Popular Avon has hired Horizon Media as agency-of-record for offline media and activation in the U.S., a move that comes after the beauty brand separated from its global parent in March and became a privately held company in North America. The North American business, which is now majority-owned by Cerberus Capital Management, operates under the name New Avon, but is still known as Avon to consumers and representatives, said Matt Harker, VP-marketing for the company. Mr. Harker said the brand is investing "significantly" more in marketing next year, especially in offline media and digital. He declined to provide further financial information, but said Cerberus, which invested $435 million in Avon, is focused on amplifying the brand in North America. Horizon was awarded the business following a competitive review. Avon has not had an incumbent for offline media in North America in a number of years, said Mr. Harker, adding that Mediavest has worked on offline media for the company in international markets. In addition to Horizon, Avon recently hired Terri & Sandy as its creative agency partner. Horizon and Terri & Sandy recently worked together on Avon's new "This is Boss Life" campaign, which launched two weeks ago across national TV, local broadcast, print and radio, such as BET, OWN, Bravo, local CBS and NBC, People, Redbook, Better Homes & Gardens, DJ Chatter and more. Mr. Harker said Horizon's ability to help Avon figure out "the power of segmentation" and who to target with its new campaign is really powerful because the brand is looking to reach future entrepreneurs, so it needs to understand the behavior and psychographics of that audience. "The campaign is about the flexibility and freedom that people are seeking in this job economy that you can get when you become an Avon representative," said Mr. Harker. "There's nothing more beautiful than succeeding on your own terms." In addition to Horizon and Terri & Sandy, New Avon worked with SocialCode on social media; London-based The Media Image for digital SEM and programmatic; and Pixability on YouTube. On the PR side, Tractenberg & Co. handles earned media around beauty, such as beauty influencer engagement, while Finn Partners is helping to tell the story about Avon's women and men who have an impact on their communities, said Mr. Harker. Avon will continue to push out its "Boss Life" initiative over the next few months, but Mr. Harker said the company will also launch more campaigns in 2017. In April, former Procter & Gamble marketing executive J. Scott White joined New Avon as CEO. Most recently he served as president of international nutrition for Abbott Laboratories, but before that he held roles throughout his 15 years at P&G including marketing director of global hair care, marketing director of Mexico and Central America and marketing director of Latin America Hair Care. Last year, New Avon, which has about 400,000 independent sales representatives across the U.S. Puerto Rico and Canada, earned more than $1 billion in revenue, according to a company statement.

Pradeep Gaur/Mint New Delhi: On 25 August, ITC Ltd filed a suit before the Delhi high court claiming copyright and trademark infringement by Britannia Industries Ltd, which it said was trying to pass off Britannia NutriChoice Zero digestive biscuit as ITC’s Sunfeast Farmlite Digestive All Good biscuit. The blue-and-yellow pack of Britannia’s biscuit, said the suit, was similar to that of ITC’s. Britannia’s arguments were expected to be defensive in nature. Instead, the company went on the offensive, claimed 66% share and leadership in the digestive biscuits category, and told the court that it was in the process of filing a cross-suit against ITC Ltd for the use of yellow colouring in digestive biscuits. Britannia’s own digestive biscuits do so and are yellow. The court heard both the original suit and the so-called cross-suit. It issued an order restraining Britannia from selling its digestive biscuits NutriChoice Zero and phase out existing stocks. Cross-suits have become the flavour of the season. At least four consumer packaged goods companies filed cross-suits in the Delhi high court over the past month against rivals suing them. “These days companies have extensive in-house and external legal assistance available to them and are also well aware of their rights. Most have a well laid out litigation strategy. When legal actions are initiated against a company, there is an increasing tendency to raise counter claims or cross actions for breach of contractual or common law rights.” said Shankh Sengupta, partner at Trilegal. Many a times, these cross actions serve as an effective offensive strategy to put the counter party on a back foot. For instance, in contractual disputes, counter parties have increasingly started raising a counter claim or cross action for breach of the rights provided to them, more often as a pressure tactic. In many such cases, the claims and counter claims are decided together by the courts, he added. A cross-suit is a suit filed by the party against which the original suit was filed, and which is then heard as part of the same case. Many of these cross-suits, claiming damages in excess of Rs 1 crore, are being used as a strategic tool by these packaged goods companies to gain a fair advantage in the original cases against them, say lawyers. Indeed, “enforcing legal rights” is perhaps becoming as “important” as “marketing”, senior advocate, Prathibha Singh, said. Britannia was yet responded to Mint’s email seeking comments sent Thursday afternoon. An ITC spokesperson declined to comment on the issue. The companies behind the original soap wars are at it too filing several cross suits against each other. Hindustan Unilever Ltd and Procter & Gamble are both claiming that the other’s ads are disparaging its brand. The brands in question are HUL’s Clinc Plus shampoo and P&G’s Head & Shoulders shampoo. On 9 September, the Delhi high court restrained HUL from airing any advertisements of Clinic Plus but the dispute, and two cross-suits remain unresolved. “Litigation is the last resort for us. We believe in strengthening self regulatory bodies and redressal of disputes through alternative dispute settlements. We have also set up, and over the years, institutionalized the Ombudsman Scheme to resolve commercial disputes with customers, suppliers and consumers through a process of mediation facilitated by independent and reputed judicial minds who are retired High Court judges.”, said an HUL spokesperson. A P&G spokesperson declined to comment on the issue. Lawyers expect several more packaged goods companies to resort to cross-suits as the courts become the newest battleground for them.

português suomeksi svenska Global Home Medical Equipment Market Outlook: 2016-2022 News provided by ReportBuyer Oct 18, 2016, 19:47 ET Share this article LONDON, Oct. 18, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The shift to home healthcare is one of several strategies being deployed to reduce the inevitable growth in the cost of delivering healthcare services. As a result, some types of medical devices and home healthcare equipment originally designed for exclusive use in hospitals and clinical settings by trained professionals are being redesigned for use by patients and lay caregivers in home environments. This dramatic shift in the delivery of healthcare is creating new opportunities for manufacturers of home healthcare equipment. Increase in ageing population, growing incidence of chronic diseases and rising healthcare expenditure are some of the key factors driving the growth of global home medical equipment market. In addition, increasing awareness about the conveniences and cost effectiveness offered by home medical equipment, Increase in the patient preference for home-based care, Upsurge in insured population as a result of the Affordable Care Act, technological advancements such as tele-health, wearable devices, mobile health applications etc; and various government initiatives to promote home healthcare are further contributing to the growth of home medical equipment market. However, changing reimbursement policies, limited insurance coverage, risk to safety and health of home healthcare worker, and growing patient safety concerns are some of the major factors that may hinder the growth of this market during the forecast period. The global home medical equipment market is mainly segmented into home tests and patient monitoring equipment which includes fertility tests, pregnancy tests, gender, dna& parental tests, drug tests, alcohol tests, cholesterol tests, HIV tests, holter monitors, blood pressure monitors, oximeters, heart rate monitors, thermometers, mediscopes, stethoscopes, defibrillators, pedometers, scales & body fat monitors, peak flow meters, apnea monitors, baby monitors, coagulation monitors, and diabetes management devices; home therapeutic equipment which includes home respiratory therapy equipment (continuous positive airway pressure equipment, oxygen delivery equipment, nebulizers & accessories, ventilators & accessories, and humidifiers), home dialysis equipment (home peritoneal dialysis products, home hemodialysis products) home IV equipment ( IV pumps, and other home IV equipment) and others; patient support equipment which includes wheelchairs and related equipment (wheelchairs- manual wheelchairs and powered wheelchairs), walking assist devices, mobility scooters, medical furniture and accessories, and bathroom safety equipment. The global home medical equipment market is further segmented by geography into five major continents namely, North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East and Africa. These regions are further analyzed at a country level to provide the market size and forecast for each segment and sub-segment of the market in various countries across the globe. North America dominates the global home medical equipment market owing to the presence of high sophisticated healthcare infrastructure, positive response to the home healthcare, favorable reimbursement policies, increasing investment in R&D facilities, and presence of large number of small and large scale home medical devices manufactures. Moreover, the recent changes in the healthcare industry due to 'Obamacare Act' will also boost the demand for such equipment, since almost 30 million uninsured Americans will now enjoy medical coverage. Similarly, Europe accounted for the second largest share of the total home medical equipment market owing to increasing aging population, high prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, and increasing healthcare investments by the European government. On the other hand, Asia-Pacific home medical equipment market is expected to grow at a rapid pace during the forecast period owing to the increasing geriatric population as elder people are prone to many disorders such as orthopedic, cardiovascular and others, rising awareness about the cost effectiveness and convenience offered by these home medical devices, and rising health care expenditures in emerging countries such as India and China, which are projected to be the fastest-growing countries in the Asian home medical equipment market during the forecast period. The report offers meticulous analysis of market dynamics, burning issues, and technological landscape of the global home medical equipment market. The report also provides a competitive landscape that covers the growth strategies adopted by industry players in the last three years.

The sticks felt clinical, complete with an "active ingredient" list on the packaging. If you wanted to go wild, you could skip the tasteless "original" flavor and spring for cherry or mint. But seven years ago, pastel-colored orbs of lip balm called EOS began to pop up everywhere. They took over shelf space at Walgreens, then Walmart, then Target. Beauty editors at Cosmo and Allure couldn't get enough of the stuff, raving about flavors like honeydew and grapefruit. And then Miley Cyrus, Christina Aguilera, and Kim Kardashian were spotted whipping balls of EOS out of their makeup bags. Products from EOS—the acronym for the company's full name, Evolution of Smooth—are splashed all over beauty and fashion magazines. But the company's founders haven't spoken about their business strategy until now. In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, they told us how they created a $250 million company that has, according to consulting and research firm Kline, become the second best-selling lip balm in the country, after Burt's Bees, and outpaces Chapstick and Blistex, which have been around for far longer. Kline Research says that EOS has singlehandedly driven growth in the oral care category. It currently sells over 1 million units a week and future prospects look promising, since the global lip care market is projected to increase steadily to $2 billion by 2020, driven by demand for natural and organic products, which is EOS's speciality. "Not necessarily building up information about it was something quite deliberate on our part," Sanjiv Mehra, EOS cofounder and managing partner, explains. Mehra points out that as a small startup, they wanted to focus all their attention on creating products and distributing them. "As we've grown, we believe that it is important for consumers to know a little bit more about the business we are and the values we stand for." Rethinking The Tube Nearly a decade ago, Mehra, who had spent his career in consumer packaged-goods companies like PepsiCo and Unilever, joined forces with Jonathan Teller and Craig Dubitsky, who had spent time at startup incubators, to think about how they could shake up the beauty aisle in the drugstore. (Dubitsky left before EOS launched to manage a new oral care company called Hello Products.) The lip balm category struck them as a prime candidate for innovation, since the vast majority of products on the market "were indistinguishable" from their 100-year-old predecessor, Teller says. Many brands appeared to be driven primarily by cutting costs and competing on price, he points out. "It appeared to us that everybody in this category was being lazy. That was an opportunity." Lip balm tended to be treated as a unisex commodity, like toothpaste or shampoo. But, as they did in-depth consumer research, they found that the product was overwhelmingly used by women as part of their beauty regime. On sensory panels, users they spoke to explained that they would lose lip balm tubes in their handbags. Many liked the idea of pots of lip balm that were entering the market, but they did not like to apply it with their fingers, because it seemed unhygienic. But one of their most important findings was that they did not find applying lip balm fun or enjoyable. "The products that women depend on every day should deliver moments of delight that elevate these daily routines," Mehra says. So they set about creating a product that would be tailor-made for women's everyday experiences, using their own funds and startup capital. (They still have not taken in external investment.) They wanted to rethink the lip balm format from the ground up, so they brought in a clay artist who modeled different shapes. "We were trying to to make the product as imaginatively as possible and not create an incremental variant over what was already in market," Teller explains. Even though they were coming up with a radically different take on the lip balm concept, they didn't want to make something that would be a fad. "We had to do it in a way that was not gimmicky, so that it would stand the test of time," Mehra says. "We had to make a product and a package that would be seen as useful for a very long time." In his mind, this meant that the lip balm had to be effective and consistently pleasurable to use, not just a wacky new addition to the lip balm aisle. In they end, they decided to think about how the product would engage all five senses, from soft round packaging that felt good in the hands, to the colors of the orbs, to the smells, to the way the flavors tasted, and even to the clicking sound the sphere makes when it closes. They would price the lip balm at about $3, so that it could compete on price with all the other drugstore lip balms, but they decided to use organic ingredients. (Earlier this year, some customers who had a bad reaction to the product brought a class action lawsuit to the company, but it was quickly settled out of court and EOS was not required to change any of its ingredients.) Throughout it all, they wanted to focus on creating an emotional connection with the user, rather than being simply another commodity. So they picked the tagline, "The lip balm that makes you smile." Big Dreams But it wasn't enough to create an innovative new product. How would a startup compete in a market dominated by giants like Chapstick, which is owned by Pfizer, and Burt's Bees, which is owned by Clorox? Mehra and Teller explain that it wasn't easy getting into stores. Mehra was himself familiar with the process, and they also hired an experienced sales representative. But buyers at drugstores and chain stores didn't know what to make of this new product. Many thought that customers were creatures of habit who were loyal to their existing lip balm brand. "There were a lot of male buyers out there who would say that they didn't understand the product," Mehra says. This makes sense, since the EOS team had carefully designed the product for female users. But then they were lucky enough to get a meeting with a female buyer at Walgreens who loved the little spheres. They landed their first account with her, and after the successful launch of the product, Walmart and Target later decided to sell EOS on their shelves. This brought them to their next big hurdle: To compete with the industry leaders, they would have to scale very quickly. They decided early on to invest in their own equipment, rather than relying on a third-party manufacturer. Mehra and Teller remember going to engineering trade shows to see how they could get experts to create machinery for them. Ultimately, they managed to create a production facility that is almost entirely automated from start to finish. This has served them well, since they were able to meet the demands of every new account they landed very quickly. Marketing To Millennials Besides getting products on shelves, the cofounders wanted to create a buzz around their new product. They decided that their target audience was millennial women between the ages of 25 and 35 who were style conscious. EOS advertised in the same ways that the older brands did, through magazine and television ads, but they also became experts at influencer marketing, which they believed was a smart way to reach their demographic. They contacted beauty bloggers who reviewed the product and talked about it on YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. They worked with millennial celebrities to get the word out about the lip balm through product placements and endorsements. EOS appeared in Miley Cyrus and Britney Spears music videos, was a headline sponsor for Demi Lovato's world tour, and Taylor Swift became its Asian spokesperson. "We became the largest advertiser in our category," Teller says. EOS has also worked to build a large social media presence. It now has more than 1.8 million followers on Instagram and nearly 7 million followers on Facebook. A photograph of a new EOS flavor can get over 40,000 likes. Finally, the brand partnered with other major players on the market. It collaborated with Keds to produce an EOS shoe that came with a matching lip balm. It worked on a limited-edition holiday collection with designer Rachael Roy. It created an Alice in Wonderland collection with Disney that sold out in days and showed up on eBay for hundreds of dollars. (Some are still being sold, starting at $75.) All of this work has paid off. In seven short years, the brand emerged from an incubator to become a household product. It has even spawned a host of copycats. Blistex and Revo (made by OraLabs) have spherical lip balms that take a page from EOS's playbook, while Walgreens and Sephora have created their own iterations of it. These days, the company sells over a million lip balms a week, which is more than they sold in their entire first year in business. For all this success, the company is working hard to continue innovating. It comes up with new collections regularly, so that there is a constant stream of new products on shelves. EOS already creates shaving creams and hand lotions, but plans to enter new categories in the future. As Mehra and Teller look back, they believe that their unique backgrounds allowed them to take on a giant of their industry. Mehra, having worked at major corporations, understood the ins and outs of big business, while Teller was immersed in startup culture. Says Mehra: "That approach of using an entrepreneurial mind-set and big-company discipline is part of how we do things every day at the company."
