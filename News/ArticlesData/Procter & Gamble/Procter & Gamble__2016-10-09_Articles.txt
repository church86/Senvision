Mayor Betsy Hodges, Dr. Michael Lomax, president and CEO of UNCF, and Target Executive Vice President Laysha Ward. On September 27 the Minneapolis Convention Center hosted the United Negro College Fund Empower Me Tour sponsored by Fed Ex and Proctor & Gamble and presented by Target. The UNCF Empower Me Tour, created in 2008 by Wells Fargo, brings Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) to the Minneapolis-St Paul area. The tour provides on-site college admission, scholarship awards, and workshops with the goal of empowering students and parents with the tools to pursue, continue and complete a college degree. “Target is really excited and honored to support UNCF and the Empower Me Tour,” said Target Executive Vice President Laysha Ward, the company’s chief corporate social responsibility officer. “We have supported UNCF for 20 years. We know education is a pathway out of poverty and into economic opportunity. By tackling education, we can help be a part of the solution.” According to Ward, Target returns five percent of its profits back to the community, equaling $4 million weekly nationwide. “It is very important we hold this event,” said Sharon Smith Akinsanya, regional development director of UNCF, whose role is to make sure enough money is available to assist low-income students in pursuing higher education in Minnesota. “We have major disparities not only in the state, but the nation.” Thousands of high school students from the Minneapolis and St. Paul school districts and surrounding areas attended the event to receive information regarding HBCUs. The students also attended workshops of empowerment regarding perceived barriers of beauty for young women called “Girl Talk,” presented by Target Vice President Caroline Wanga, poet and youth engager of CoolSpeak Natasha Carrizosa, and Hampton University graduate and Miss HBVS LaQuayle Argurs. __________________________________________________________________________________________________ “Our future depends on getting it right for all of our kids, but especially our children of color.” __________________________________________________________________________________________________ There were also workshops that focused on overcoming barriers as young Black men. They included testimonies by creator of the nonprofit Tied to Greatness Dr. Alex Ellis, CEO of Harvest Network of Schools Eric Mahmoud, Chief Inclusion Officer James Burroughs, and 2014 Hampton University graduate Kyle G. Mason. Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges expressed the importance of Minneapolis being a location for the UNCF Empower Me Tour because of having “the worst disparities in the nation between Black and White students. Our future depends on getting it right for all of our kids, but especially our children of color. The United Negro College Fund has been dedicated to making sure that young children succeed. “One of the great trends happening in Minneapolis is that we are becoming more diverse over time,” continued Hodges. “Even before I was mayor I knew the value of UNCF and what they do. But as mayor I can see it at work on the ground, giving young people an imagination for an educational future that can set them up for the rest of their lives.” An article published last year in the Washington Post by Valerie Strauss indicated the enrollment at many HBCUs such as Shaw University, South Carolina State, Tuskegee, Virginia State University, Dillard and Florida Memorial University have seen enrollment jumps of 29 percent or more. These institutions are depending on overflow housing to adjust to the growth of enrollment.

Mayor Betsy Hodges, Dr. Michael Lomax, president and CEO of UNCF and Target Executive Vice President Laysha Ward. Dr. Michael L. Lomax,, said when the Empower Me Tour was first created eight years ago it was solely focused on financial literacy, targeting high school and college students. “Over the eight years, we re-engineered the program for the focus of high school students to become college-ready and helping college students become career-ready,” Dr. Lomax told the MSR. In addition to the tour awarding $1.5 million in scholarships to Twin Cities students who attended the Empower Me Tour last year, Dr. Lomax reported that UNCF is very focused on academic preparation. “We really focus on ‘Are you taking the right courses and preparing yourself for some post-secondary education?’ We know some students will go on to community college or apprenticeship programs, but our main [goal and message] is education is going to be a part of your preparation regardless.” Nationwide, the UNCF Empower Me Tour awards 10,000 scholarships and internships in just under 400 programs to its 37 Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Those awarded scholarships from the Twin Cities graduate at a rate of 81.9 percent. Lomax explained, “The name of the tour is the Empower Me Tour, suggesting there is a psychological and social impact of the program as well, giving young people the sense [that] they can take ownership of their lives. As daunting and confusing as the journey may be, they can own that journey and drive it toward the goals they want to achieve.” The Empower Me Tour that kicked off in Minneapolis will continue on to three more cities:  Chicago, IL, Oakland, CA and Rochester, NY.   For more information regarding the UNCF Empower Me Tour, visit them on Facebook at UNCFEmpowerMeTour #UNCFEmpowerMeTour on Instagram and @EmpowerMeTour #EmpowerMeTour on Twitter.

Ronald Reagan trailed Jimmy Carter by 15 points in February-March of 1980. Then Reagan came back and won in a 44 state landslide. One thing is for sure, the U.S. dollar is expected to weaken regardless of the final outcome, and for companies that thrive on a weaker greenback, 2017 could be a great year. We screened the Merrill Lynch database for stocks that were rated Buy, that also did a significant amount of their sales and business overseas. We found four that look very attractive, and could make good sense as we head to 2017. General Electric This iconic blue chip industrial was on a roll but has sold off 15% since July and is giving investors a nice entry point. General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) is a highly diversified, global industrial corporation. Its businesses are organized broadly under six segments: GE Capital, Energy Infrastructure, Aviation, Healthcare, Transportation and Home & Business Solutions. Its products and services include power generation equipment, aircraft engines, locomotives, medical equipment, appliances, commercial leasing and personal finance. Wall Street analysts feel that the American giant will be a large player in the efficient energy field. While the analysts recently lowered earnings expectations for the quarter slightly, they remain positive as expectations for orders and free cash flow already seem very low. They also note that the industrial giant has a massive $25 billion in cash, which could be put to use to drive earnings toward $2 a share by 2018. GE shareholders are paid a 3.16% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target for the stock is $37, and the Wall Street consensus target is $33.13. The shares closed last Friday at $29.08. Intel This leader in semiconductors is working hard to scale away from dependence on personal computers. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) designs, manufactures and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company’s platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, two-in-one systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, wearables, retail devices and manufacturing devices, as well as for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings, home use and other market segments. The company also provides communication and connectivity offerings, such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers and power management integrated circuits, and tablet, phone and Internet of Things solutions, which include multimode 4G LTE modems, Bluetooth technology and GPS receivers, software solutions and interoperability tests, as well as home gateway and set-top box components. Intel reported an inline second quarter, but data center sales came in way below expectations. However, a new partnership with Microsoft for virtual reality, and a consistent shift away for reliance on chips for personal computers, keeps the stock a compelling buy. Intel does a stunning 82.4% of its sales overseas, the lion’s share of it in Asia, where the chips that it produces are used in personal computers, tablets and other personal electronic devices. Intel investors are paid a solid 2.73% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target is $45, while the consensus target is lower at $40.38. The shares closed Friday at $38.10.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ HULHindustan UniLeverDabur EXPAND TO VIEW ALL MUMBAI: Hindustan Unilever (HUL) now controls nearly half the hair care market in India to reach its highest share in more than a decade, helped by new launches amid weakening competition. The maker of Clinic Plus and Dove shampoo gained over 450 basis points since the past three years with 48.8% share in the year to August, exactly double than arch rival Procter & Gamble that ceded more than 500 bps over the same period, revealed Nielsen data obtained from sources. In line with their client confidentiality policy, Nielsen did not validate the information. “We have a large portfolio. Ten brands, 30 variants, 300 stock keeping units. All of these have a role to play to meet the different consumer needs and aspirations,” said Sandeep Kohli in his first interview after becoming executive director of HUL’s largest business — personal care. “We have gone back to the vision on what portfolio to bring to the market, based on what are the needs of consumers with the best of knowledge in science, branding and positioning that we know. It’s the whole of Unilever coming together and putting that in our portfolio.” The shampoo segment, worth Rs 8,000 crore, is important for HUL. Its overall personal care contributed about half the company’s total revenues of Rs 13,718 crore in FY16, around two-thirds of HUL’s net profit. No wonder, its presence in shampoos which were largely restricted to the so-called mid-priced shampoos with its Clinic and Sunsilk brands, is seeing a premiumisation drive with newer brands such as Tresemme and TIGI. Analysts feel HUL’s new launches in FY16 in the personal care category indicate its efforts to increase the proportion of premium products in its personal products portfolio, with 13 out of 15 launches positioned in the premium category. “HUL should benefit from the improving affordability of premium products for Indian consumers, given the strength of its rural distribution network and a brand range that ensures HUL’s presence across all price points,” wrote Sunita Sachdev of UBS in a recent investor note. P&G has also been de-prioritising several unprofitable lines of business including smaller shampoo packs or sachets, a move that has impacted short-term top line growth rates. P&G’s strategy in India has been paying off — profit margin is up 750 basis points and the company has gone from losing significant money in the country to triple-digit profits in the past two years. However, businesses that are not strategically important for them which account for about 15% of its overall portfolio, shrank 35%. Penetration of shampoo in India is more than 90%, but the per capita consumption is 150 ml, about three times lower than most emerging markets such as Philippines. Besides multinational firms such as P&G and L’Oreal, many local companies like Dabur and CavinKare have brands at various price points. And new players such as ITC and Patanjali are also getting aggressive. The company said it had become more nimble to fight competition and has empowered executives to take bigger and faster decisions without much bureacracy. “They are closest to the consumer and can serve the business better and faster,” said Kohli who isn’t piggybacking on its Anglo-Dutch parent entirely for hair care expertise. “We have very good science in the products we are formulating and understanding on consumers’ needs and trends. But we do it through a lens of understanding Indian consumer needs instead of simply bringing global mixes here.” Experts said Unilever’s global CEO Paul Polman has been shifting focus from low growth food into faster growing personal care, explaining a string of acquisitions in the segment with few hair care brands such as Alberto Culver, TIGI globally and more recently Indulekha in India.

But as it turned out, I was to spend less than week in that blissful motherhood bubble. I was still in hospital, drips and tubes attached, when I learned that the person due to cover for me had decided not to take the job after all. Sandberg: U.S. Behind Saudi Arabia on Maternity Leave Play! 00:47 Instead of being able to lose myself in the delight of every movement of Clio’s tiny fingers, a week later I was back at my desk - and those first few months turned into a blur of trying to keep my baby quiet in a sling, while conducting staff meetings in my living room. Although I hated it, at the time, it was what I felt I had to do - and this week, one of the UK’s leading businesswomen has said I was exactly right to only take a ‘micro-maternity leave’ and get straight back to work. Shared Parental Leave FAQ At the point when UK women have won more maternity leave than ever – a full year, 39 weeks of which are paid – Lady Barbara Judge, the first female Chairman of the Institute of Directors, has come out and said such long breaks are disastrous for women in the workplace. Lady Judge, who herself took just 12 days off work when her son was born, said she believed that arrangements in the US, where companies with more than 50 employees are only obliged to offer 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave, are better than the British system, because women “don’t come off the [career] tracks”. Shared Parental Leave FAQ “I know it’s counter-cultural but I think long maternity breaks are bad for women,” she told an audience at the Wealth Management Association’s Women In Wealth Forum. “A friend of mine wanted to take a year off to look after her adopted baby. I told her: “You’re mad. You have a great job and, trust me, you’ll lose it if you take a year off. “She took 12 month’s maternity leave, she returned to work – and then three months later the financial crisis hit. The first job they cut was hers. Why? Because her boss had been doing her job for a year. They realised they didn’t need her.” So is Lady Judge right: if you want to baby-proof your career, then taking advantage of generous maternity rights might back-fire?  Lady Barbara Judge has come out in favour of 'micro-maternity leave' Credit: JANE MINGAY Ben Black, director of My Family Care, which provides childcare support to businesses such like P&G, Barclays, KPMG, Deloitte, and IBM thinks so.  “Of course maternity leave damages your career,” says Black. “It would be crazy to think it doesn’t and being able to talk honestly about just how much damage [it does] is another challenge in itself. And yes, the longer the leave the bigger the damage. If you have a year out, you’re a year behind when you come back.” His company's survey of 1,000 parents across the UK  found that more than half of women believe that their jobs are under threat when they take maternity leave. And perhaps so-called ‘maternity paranoia’ is increasingly justified. Of the 340,000 women who take maternity leave each year in the UK, as many 50,000 find their jobs under threat, according to data analysed by the House of Commons library last year. These are the returners who find their jobs have been conveniently axed as part of ‘restructuring’ while they have been away, or who are turned down for flexible working, which makes juggling working hours and nursery pick-ups impossible.  Those who return to work after having a child may find there’s a different price to be paid - on average, ending up earning a third less than men in equivalent roles, as they are passed over for promotions and pay rises, according to this summer’s study on the gender pay gap by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Even Yahoo CEO, Marissa Mayer - who one might think had made her ascent up the career ladder - was back at work less than a month after having twin daughters, in December. And that was double the two weeks' leave she took after the birth of her first child in 2012. Indeed in the business world, returning to meetings fresh from the maternity ward has become the equivalent to celebrity mothers being pictured in a pair of skinny jeans two days after checking out of the Portland.  Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer was back at work less than a month after having twin daughters Credit: AP Photo/Julie Jacobson The problem is the implication that women who use their full allowance are somehow less committed is trickling down through every levels.  And ignores the very real separation pangs that a woman experiences when she is separated from her baby too soon.  Maternity leave is long for good reason, say experts. While some women may feel physically and psychologically up to going to work after only a few weeks, most definitely won’t. Abi Wood, head of campaigns at parenting charity, NCT, said: “In the early weeks its really important for women to physically recover from birth and bond with their baby who will be changing every day. It is important that parents have a choice and that they are not told what to do as everyone is different.’ If you have a year out, you’re a year behind when you come backBen Black, director of My Family Care Sarah Jackson, CEO of Working Families also points out that the World Health Organisation recommends 26-week-long maternity leave to properly establish breast-feeding. Women who return before are more likely to go on sick leave. “All the business evidence shows that well paid, longer maternity leave make for a more successful return to the workforce," says Jackson, "you’re more likely to retain your women and see career progression if a woman has had properly paid and longer maternity leave.” Polly Buckland with her two daughters Polly Buckland, 34, from Odiham, Hants, still regrets going back to work three weeks after the birth of her second child, Ruby, in January 2013 because her marketing business, The Typeface Group, was going limited. She know that it’s time she can never get back.  “Ruby’s coming up for four in January, and the other day she turned to me and said: ‘Mummy. Do you remember when I was a baby and Becky (her nanny) was my Mummy? “It just seems a million years ago that she was a tiny baby. I so wish I hadn’t spent that time glued to my emails.” As for me, now Clio is 11, I also mourn those lost baby days more than ever. Looking back, and in the scheme of my career, I am more certain than ever that they were not worth sacrificing for meetings and memos to people whose names I no longer remember about issues I no longer care about.

The 271,000-sq. ft. building will house primary care offices, registration, a mental health space, physical medicine and rehabilitation, dental, women’s clinic. JOHN VALENZUELA — STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER By Jim Steinberg, The Sun Posted: 10/07/16, 6:19 PM PDT | Updated: on 10/07/2016 # Comments World World II veterans Norman Gibbs, left, of Banning, Augustine Martinez of Murrieta, VA Loma Linda Healthcare System Director Barbara Fallen and Robert Chism of Loma Linda cut the ribbon for the new VA Loma Linda Ambulatory Care Center in Redlands on Friday. JOHN VALENZUELA — STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER By the numbers New Ambulatory Care Center in Redlands $11 million - cost of the new facility 72,000 - veterans served in San Bernardino, Riverside and eastern Los Angeles counties 20 - years of planning 271,000 - square feet of space 2,015 - parking spaces 2,700 & 510 - employees and volunteers, respectively, 300 - veterans, political and civic leaders who attended Friday’s ribbon-cutting ceremony REDLANDS >> Gone are the days of operating out of a “shoebox.” The opening of a new 271,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art veterans outpatient treatment center Wednesday will unclog a congested Veterans Affairs Healthcare hospital campus, allow doctors to see more patients in a day, and enable the introduction of new services. Services at the VA Loma Linda Healthcare System’s new $11 million Ambulatory Care Center in Redlands will for the first time fully integrate primary care with behavioral health services, something not possible at the main hospital campus, the Jerry L. Pettis Memorial VA Medical Center in Loma Linda, said Barbara Fallen, director of the Loma Linda Healthcare System. Locations Ambulatory Care Center (ACC) 26001 Redlands Blvd., Redlands, CA 92373 Jerry L. Pettis Memorial Veterans Medical Center 11201 Benton St., Loma Linda, CA 92357 The Loma Linda system serves 72,000 veterans in San Bernardino, Riverside and eastern Los Angeles counties. Pettis Medical Center opened in 1977 and was built for 27,000 patients, Fallen said. After some 20 years of planning, more than 300 veterans, political and civic leaders attended a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new building, located at 26100 Redlands Blvd. in Redlands. It is less than 2 miles northeast of Pettis Medical Center. “We have been living in a shoebox,” Fallen said during her formal remarks prior to the ribbon-cutting Friday. The promise of more comprehensive and faster delivery of medical services occurs during an era of heightened awareness of deficiencies in medical treatment for veterans returning home after service in Iraq and Afghanistan. Outcry over lengthy periods veterans had to wait for appointments and other problems led to the resignation of longtime VA Secretary Eric Shinseki in 2014. He was replaced by former Procter & Gamble CEO Robert McDonald, who visited the construction site of the VA’s new ambulatory care center in 2015 and brought with him a message that he wants to get veterans “the care they have earned.” One of the legislative actions to come out of that turmoil was the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for Americans Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama in February 2015, which aims to reduce that number and improve the mental health of veterans who are transitioning out of the military. The Loma Linda VA is acting as a the regional lead hospital in a pilot program to widen the net of health care providers available to veterans, which is one of the goals of the act. “We need to do everything we can to ensure our veterans have access to timely and quality health care, so I’m glad to see increased services for Inland Empire veterans through the opening of the Ambulatory Care Center,” Rep. Pete Aguilar, who toured the facility Friday, said in a statement. Advertisement There was loud applause from the audience when Prachi Asher, VA Loma Linda Healthcare assistant director, said the new facility has “plenty of parking.” Veterans have long complained that finding a parking spot at the main campus is a nightmare. The new facility has 2,015 parking spaces versus 1,925 at the main campus, Asher said. “The parking is fantastic here,” said Richard Valdez, legislative director for Disabled American Veterans in California and past commander for both the DAV’s San Bernardino chapter and the state organization. Valdez was one of the ribbon-cutting attendees. In addition to shifting thousands of VA patients to the new building’s parking spaces, the transfer of 650 staff members to the new facility will free up those parking spots as well, Fallen said. There have been 50 new hires specifically for the Ambulatory Care Center, primarily in the areas of security, clerical, laboratory and cleaning functions, Fallen said. “The inefficiencies of staff crowding can be decompressed in the new building,” said Dr. Marion Sherman, behavioral medicine service chief for the Loma Linda VA. Therapy staffs were sharing a room at the main campus, and would often have to hunt for space to see a patient, she said. Primary care physicians often had only one room for patients in the older building, meaning they would need to wait for the next patient’s vitals to be taken. In the new building, primary care doctors will have up to three rooms, so they can quickly move from one patient to the next, Fallen said. “This building will allow us to make more efficient use of the staff that we have,” Sherman said. Because the behavioral medicine staff is integrated throughout the Ambulatory Care Center, a primary care physician can immediately call in a mental health professional if the discussion with a patient moves to areas that include, for example, nightmares, excessive drinking or anger management, Sherman said. That was not possible in the old building because of the distance between the two specialties and because the few patient rooms needed to be quickly turned over, Sherman said. Services offered in the Ambulatory Care Center will include primary care, mental health, physical medicine and rehabilitation, dental, a women’s clinic and patient education.

Prior to that she spent seventeen years with W+K. She joined W+K Portland as an art director in September of 1996 and spent the next seven years in the position, working with brands including Nike, Diet Coke, Belvedere and Amazon. Flagg then spent the next nine years as a creative director with the agency, working with such clients as P&G, Facebook, Kraft, Levis, Starbucks, Sony and Old Spice, as well as continuing to work with Nike. She then spent ten months as creative director/art director for the Nike Foundation GirlEffect Project in Ethiopia, helping to launch Yegna (pronounced yen-ya), the country’s first teen girl brand, before leaving W+K to go freelance. Leach joined TBWA/MAL just a few months after Flagg, in August of 2014, following four and a half years as creative director for Chance Studio, the branding and design studio she founded in 2010. Before founding Chance Studio she spent two years as a creative director with W+K New York. That followed nearly eleven years client-side as executive vice president, creative director for fashion and design company Kate Spade. The news is the latest in a series of executive departures for TBWA\MAL. Last month chief strategy officer Rebecca Stambanis, executive creative director Jorge Calleja and executive director of integration Kaitlyn Wilkins all left after less than six months with the agency. Stambansis and Calleja had filled vacancies left by the February departures of Marc-Antoine Jarry and Eric Grunbaum while worldwide managing director Dave Dreyer and executive creative director Steve Turner both left the agency in April. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Many oil producers outside OPEC have expressed a willingness to cooperate on output caps, said Saudi Arabia’s Energy and Industry Minister Khalid Al-Falih at an energy congress in Istanbul, according to Bloomberg. He added that he was “optimistic” there’ll be a deal that could lift prices as high as US$60 by year-end. "Russia is ready to join the joint measures to cap production and is calling for other oil exporters to join," Russian President Vladimir Putin said in Istanbul, according to Reuters. Oil prices rallied, with Brent touching US$53.73 a barrel, the highest level in a year, in London. "Putin coming out to say Russia will be part of the initiative has added another layer of credence to the speculation there will be a coordinated cut," John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital, told Reuters. "At some point, the market will call them on it and say 'show us the cuts’,” Kilduff noted. “And at that point, the Saudis might be willing to underwrite the cuts on their own because they really want these high prices. To me, US$55 Brent is without doubt the next target," he said. Wall Street and energy stocks followed suit. In 2.07pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 0.8 percent. In 1.52pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.5 percent. The Dow advanced as gains in shares of Apple as well as those of Exxon Mobil and Chevron, recently up 2.1 percent, 2.1 percent and 1.9 percent respectively, outweighed slides in shares of Wal-Mart and those of Procter & Gamble, recently down 1.2 percent and1 percent respectively. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the day with a gain of 0.7 percent, bolstered by advances in energy stocks. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index increased 0.8 percent, France’s CAC 40 Index rose 1.1 percent, while Germany’s DAX Index added 1.3 percent. “Russia’s comments on supporting an OPEC deal are creating positive sentiment,” Samy Chaar, chief economist at Lombard Odier in Geneva, told Bloomberg. A perception that Democratic US Presidential candidate Hilary Clinton won the second debate with Republican candidate Donald Trump, securing her chances to win, helped underpin the mood on financial markets. Investors are gearing up for a fresh round of US quarterly earnings, with Alcoa set to report on Tuesday. Meanwhile, shares of Twitter sank further, down 13.3 percent as of 2.24pm in New York, amid reports that it has failed to attract any potential bidders.

While you were sleeping: Oil boosts stocks Oct. 11 (BusinessDesk) – Equities on both sides of the Atlantic rose with the price of oil after Russia signalled it will join an agreement to curb oil output. Many oil producers outside OPEC have expressed a willingness to cooperate on output caps, said Saudi Arabia’s Energy and Industry Minister Khalid Al-Falih at an energy congress in Istanbul, according to Bloomberg. He added that he was “optimistic” there’ll be a deal that could lift prices as high as US$60 by year-end. “Russia is ready to join the joint measures to cap production and is calling for other oil exporters to join,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said in Istanbul, according to Reuters. Oil prices rallied, with Brent touching US$53.73 a barrel, the highest level in a year, in London. “Putin coming out to say Russia will be part of the initiative has added another layer of credence to the speculation there will be a coordinated cut,” John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital, told Reuters. “At some point, the market will call them on it and say ‘show us the cuts’,” Kilduff noted. “And at that point, the Saudis might be willing to underwrite the cuts on their own because they really want these high prices. To me, US$55 Brent is without doubt the next target,” he said. Wall Street and energy stocks followed suit. In 2.07pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 0.8 percent. In 1.52pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.5 percent. The Dow advanced as gains in shares of Apple as well as those of Exxon Mobil and Chevron, recently up 2.1 percent, 2.1 percent and 1.9 percent respectively, outweighed slides in shares of Wal-Mart and those of Procter & Gamble, recently down 1.2 percent and1 percent respectively. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the day with a gain of 0.7 percent, bolstered by advances in energy stocks. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index increased 0.8 percent, France’s CAC 40 Index rose 1.1 percent, while Germany’s DAX Index added 1.3 percent. “Russia’s comments on supporting an OPEC deal are creating positive sentiment,” Samy Chaar, chief economist at Lombard Odier in Geneva, told Bloomberg. A perception that Democratic US Presidential candidate Hilary Clinton won the second debate with Republican candidate Donald Trump, securing her chances to win, helped underpin the mood on financial markets. Investors are gearing up for a fresh round of US quarterly earnings, with Alcoa set to report on Tuesday. Meanwhile, shares of Twitter sank further, down 13.3 percent as of 2.24pm in New York, amid reports that it has failed to attract any potential bidders.

The book tells the story of a boy, Zee, who saves a dog tied up on a short chain. The story is inspired by the children in the community who walk for many kilometres to seek veterinary care for their pets and who also play a huge role in saving stray animals. The book will serve as an educational tool to teach even more children about pet care and compassion. CLAW’s clinic provides free veterinary healthcare services to the impoverished community where vet care is non-existent. They give back to the people of Durban Deep and host workshops to educate the community. CLAW hopes to have the book in every school in the township so it can be read by every child. The children’s book has been a two-and-half-year labour of love for the team at Grey: writer Toni Cheiman and designer Greer van Eyssen. The pair came up with the idea of creating a children’s book for CLAW in 2014 as a pro bono project. “CLAW have a very trusted relationship with the Durban Deep community and for years they’ve been teaching kids about animal welfare and how to care for their pets, so the idea for a children’s book was so obvious it was genius,” Toni explains. Sinead Floyd, designer at Grey, offered to illustrate the entire book, and her unique style brought all the special characters to life. “We’re extremely happy with the result; Zee Rescues a Friend could proudly stand on the shelf of any major book retailer. But what was more rewarding was seeing how much the Durban Deep children enjoyed it. Because it was inspired and written for them,” Greer adds. The project was crowdfunded on Thundafund, which rewards “backers” for donating to the project. In the end the Grey team raised much needed funds for CLAW and the printing of the book was kindly sponsored by RMB, championed by Anneke van Zyl. CLAW received over 900 books; every child who attended the book launch on Saturday received a copy, and there are plans to make the book available as an e-book on CLAW’s website to continue raising funds and educating children everywhere. As this press release was about to go out, we received word from CLAW’s project manager, Sheena Dale. She had presented the book to her IFAW (International Fund for Animal Welfare) colleagues at the CITES/COP Convention, and IFAW Headquarters (based in Cape Cod, USA) has requested an e-book version to distrbute worldwide, and in addition, a Spanish version of the book will be made for distribution in Mexico. The story is about a boy who saves a dog, but perhaps why the tale is so globally relevant and poignant, is because it’s actually the dog that saves the boy.

Published on October 10, 2016. Reprints Reprints Credit: Kimberly-Clark Corp. Most Popular Kimberly-Clark Corp. is up against tech companies, investment banks and its own set of formidable direct competitors as it tries to woo millennials to marketing and other jobs in a place many of them have never heard of -- Neenah, Wis. So now it's turning like never before to marketing to get the job done -- and filled -- essentially treating K-C like a brand aimed at the 4,000 to 5,000 people it needs to hire each year to replenish and expand its workforce of 43,000 plus. A new digital ad campaign -- backed by Relish, Atlanta, WPP media shop Mindshare and PR from McGrath Business Communications -- breaks today, with ads on Facebook and LinkedIn, followed by an influencer-marketing program. The "Welcome Original Thinkers" effort focuses on an online quiz to help prospective employees learn what kind of thinkers they are, what kind of jobs they'd best fit, and in the process show that the 144-year-old paper and personal-care products company and its Neenah home base are "pretty cool." Related Stories Creativity Marks This Spot: K-C Thrives in Tiny Neenah Kimberly-Clark Names Family-Care Exec Scott Usitalo CMO How Kimberly-Clark Made Peace with Greenpeace Beware the 'Authenticity Trap' When Marketing to Millennials Every Young Person Has the Potential to Be the Next CMO Heading the effort is Global Marketing Director Frans Mahieu, a veteran of Ogilvy & Mather, Ralston-Purina, Novartis and K-C's own now-spun-off healthcare business. He's in his sixth year running K-C's employer brand. He said he applies essentially the same marketing formula used to successfully rescue the once-scuffling, now resurgent Kotex into U by Kotex. Part of that is seeking out diversity on a dimension outside the typical realm of HR campaigns, aimed more at diversity of thought with the "Original Thinkers Quiz." "You need different points of view," Mr. Mahieu said. "That's when you start building on each other's ideas. Hopefully you come away from that with the best idea. It's important you don't shy away from the debate." While appealing to those thinkers means building the Kimberly-Clark brand, it also means building up Neenah, part of a Fox Cities region that includes Appleton and 20 other towns with a combined 500,000 people around Lake Winnebago. Mr. Mahieu, based in Atlanta, acknowledges it's a challenge, but that he's developed a growing fondness for the area himself in regular visits during his past six years on the job. "Since we are competing for talent that works in some of the more urban areas, we felt we need to do a better job," Mr. Mahieu said. "What you sell with Neenah, Wis., is that you can have a balance of life that's probably more fulfilling than a lot of other places. " Like a growing number of other consumer packaged goods companies with offices based in smaller Midwestern cities, such as SC Johnson (Racine, Wis.) and ConAgra Foods (Omaha, Neb.), K-C also has a marketing outpost in Chicago. But Mr. Mahieu said space there is limited, housing mainly digital marketers, while most K-C marketers remain in Neenah with the rest of the North American headquarters. Global headquarters are in Irving, Tex., near Dallas. "K-C will always have a challenge selling Neenah as an attractive destination for top talent," said David Wiser, Cincinnati-based recruiter and P&G alum. He cites no major sports teams closer than the Packers in Green Bay an hour away, limited arts and cultural opportunities, and a two-hour drive to Milwaukee or four-hour-plus drive to Chicago. Add to that, he said, "Big CPG" has fallen out of favor with top undergrads and MBAs, who are more likely to opt for tech or Wall Street jobs. And then it's also up against a host of competitors in bigger cities, including several in metro New York, Clorox Co. in Oakland, Calif., General Mills in Minneapolis and P&G in Cincinnati. But realistically, K-C has been outperforming many of those peer companies -- Neenah or no -- on the top line in recent years, so it's been getting some talent. And beyond the easy commute and communing with nature, Mr. Mahieu points to a burgeoning arts center in Appleton, a booming microbrewery industry and a progressive small-town ambiance he likens to "Vermont of the Midwest." He also believes the company will get traction with a concept that would seemingly intimidate a generation raised on participation trophies and collaboration -- K-C's aggressive stance on weeding out low performers detailed in a recent Wall Street Journal article. That's accomplished with regular feedback as opposed to simply relying on annual reviews, and Mr. Mahieu believes it resonates with millennials. "We want to hire those people who want to perform," he said. "So sharing with them that we have a performance culture for the right talent is actually very effective." He also believes that putting marketers into recruiting in an effort to build employer brands is the wave of the future, and is fast growing from rarity to standard practice. When he came into his position as a marketer six years ago, he said, he was the only person at industry HR gatherings from a marketing background. Now, he said 30% to 50% of larger companies have people from marketing or communications working on employer branding. "I expect that two years from now, probably close to 80% to 90% of major companies will have people with marketing backgrounds running their employer brands," he said, "because it's so important."

/PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Following is the daily "Profile America" feature from the U.S. Census Bureau: CLEANING POWER Profile America — Monday, October 10th. Something that we all take for granted made its appearance on this date in 1933, when the first household detergent — named Dreft, and still in production — went on sale. The chemistry of making soap had changed little over hundreds of years, until shortages of fats for making soap during World War I sparked research. Detergents really took off following World War II, and by 1953, their sales had passed those of traditional soaps. Now, detergents have all but replaced soap-based products for laundry, dishwashing, and household cleaning, and most soaps for personal hygiene contain some detergents. Some 650 U.S. manufacturers produce $23 billion worth of detergents and soaps each year.

"We will not only demand the end to prison slavery, we will end it ourselves by ceasing to be slaves," prisoners of the Free Alabama Movement, the Free Ohio Movement and the IWW Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee wrote in a communique. This round of prison strikes -- there will be more -- has had little outside support and press coverage. There have been few protests outside prison walls. Prison authorities -- unlike during the 1971 Attica uprising when the press was allowed into the yard to interview the rebellious prisoners -- have shut out a compliant media. They have identified strike leaders and placed them in isolation. Whole prisons in states such as Texas were put on lock-down on the eve of the strike. It is hard to know how many prisoners are still on strike, just as it is hard to know how many stopped work or started to fast on Sept. 9. Before the strike I was able to speak to prisoner leaders including Melvin Ray, James Pleasant and Robert Earl Council, all of whom led work stoppages in Alabama prisons in January 2014 as part of the Free Alabama Movement, as well as Siddique Hasan, one of five leaders of the April 1993 uprising at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility at Lucasville, Ohio. (The Ohio revolt saw prisoners take control of the facility for 11 days after numerous grievances, including complaints about deaths allegedly caused by beatings from guards, went unanswered.) Now, authorities have cut off the access of these and other prisoner leaders to the press and the rest of the outside world. I have not been able to communicate with the four men since the strike began. These prison strike leaders put no hope in a "national conversation" about race and mass incarceration. They know that corporations, the courts and politicians will never halt the lethal police violence against unarmed men and women of color or dismantle the vast gulags for the poor that dot the country. The mechanisms of repression are by design. They are the logical consequence of deindustrialization. The corporate state uses fear, police violence and huge networks of jails and prisons to keep hundreds of millions of underemployed and unemployed poor people from revolting. "We have to shut down the prisons," Council, known as Kinetik, one of the founders of the Free Alabama Movement, told me by phone from the Holman Correctional Facility in Escambia County, Ala. He has been in prison 21 years, serving a sentence of life without parole. "We will not work for free anymore. All the work in prisons, from cleaning to cutting grass to working in the kitchen, is done by inmate labor. [Almost no prisoner] in Alabama is paid. Without us the prisons, which are slave empires, cannot function. Prisons, at the same time, charge us a variety of fees, such as for our identification cards or wrist bracelets, and [impose] numerous fines, especially for possession of contraband. They charge us high phone and commissary prices. Prisons each year are taking larger and larger sums of money from the inmates and their families. The state gets from us millions of dollars in free labor and then imposes fees and fines. You have brothers that work in kitchens 12 to 15 hours a day and have done this for years and have never been paid." - Advertisement - These strike leaders say that, inside and outside the prison walls, rebellion is the only option. "We are not going to call for protests outside of statehouses," Ray said. "Legislators are owned by corporations. To go up there with the achy-breaky heart is not going to do any good. These politicians are in it for the money. If you are fighting mass incarceration, the people who are incarcerated are not in the statehouse. They are not in the parks. They are in the prisons. If you are going to fight for the people in prison, join them at the prison. The kryptonite to fight the prison system, which is a $500 billion enterprise, is the work strike. And we need people to come to the prisons to let guys on the inside know they have outside support to shut the prison down. Once we take our labor back, prisons will again become places for correction and rehabilitation rather than centers of corporate profit." These striking prisoners are far more effective, and far more threatening to the corporate state, than the outside multitudes entranced and manipulated by the Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Goon Show. Denied the right to employment, to vote and to public assistance because of felony convictions, denied the right to justice because they are poor, and denied a voice because they have been silenced by state censorship and a bankrupt media, these prisoners were some of the first to understand the totalitarian nature of the corporate state. "We do not believe in the political process," said Ray, who spoke from the St. Clair Correctional Facility in Springville, Ala., and who is serving life without parole. "We are not looking to politicians to submit reform bills. We aren't giving more money to lawyers. We don't believe in the courts. We will rely only on protests inside and outside of prisons and on targeting the corporations that exploit prison labor and finance the school-to-prison pipeline." The 2.3 million human beings, most of them poor people of color, who are locked in cages across the country provide billions in salaries and other revenues for depressed rural towns with large prisons. They provide billions more in profits to phone card companies, money transfer companies, food service companies, merchandise vendors, construction companies, laundry services, uniform companies, prison equipment vendors and the manufacturers of pepper spray, body armor and the many other medieval instruments used for the physical restraint of prisoners. They also make billions for corporations -- Whole Foods, Verizon, Starbucks, McDonald's, Sprint, Victoria's Secret, American Airlines, J.C. Penney, Sears, Wal-Mart, Kmart, Eddie Bauer, Wendy's, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Fruit of the Loom, Motorola, Caterpillar and dozens of others -- that collectively exploit 1 million prison laborers. - Advertisement - Why pay workers outside the walls the minimum wage when you can pay workers behind walls only a couple of dollars a day? Why exploit sweatshop workers in countries like Bangladesh when you can exploit sweatshop workers in U.S. prisons? Why permit prison reform that would impede profits? Why not expand a system that reduces labor costs to slave wages? "The beauty of a work stoppage is that the prison administrators have to bring in compensated labor," Hasan told me last year when I visited him on death row in Ohio. "This is what happened in the Georgia prison system in 2010 when the prisoners held a work stoppage for six days. It cost the state a lot of money." Prisoners are the ideal workers in corporate America. They earn from 8 cents to about 44 cents an hour. In some states, such as Alabama, they earn nothing. They receive no Social Security, pensions or other benefits. They do not get paid overtime. They are prohibited from organizing or carrying out strikes. They always show up on time. They are not paid for sick days or granted vacations. They cannot complain about poor working conditions or safety hazards. If they protest their meager wages or working conditions they instantly lose their jobs and are placed in isolation cells. They live in an environment where they daily face the possibility of torture, beatings, prolonged isolation, sensory deprivation, racial profiling, rancid food, inadequate medical care, little or no heating and ventilation, and rape. In short, they are slaves. The bondage that prisoners endure is, little by little, being imposed on us. The fight inside prison walls is our own. And the harsh repression inside prisons to halt the new strike mirrors the harsh repression that awaits us if we resist.

Shots Studios rebrands from selfie app to social star video factory Posted Oct 5, 2016 by Josh Constine (@joshconstine), Katie Roof (@Katie_Roof) 0 SHARES Next Story InkHunter’s AR tattoo app exits beta on Android as startup looks to wider, B2B play Twitter once tried to buy Shots for $150 million to score its 3 million rabid teen users, a source tells TechCrunch. But the Justin Bieber-funded selfie app developer dreamed of a different destiny, where it would become the “Saturday Night Live” of the mobile generation. The Shots app grew to a peak of almost 8 million users, but ultimately it was too difficult to compete with Instagram and Snapchat. Despite a shift to comedy and acquisitions like lo-fi video capture app Camcorder and music video maker Mindie, the Shots team decided they were better off as a content creator. Social media stars from Vine, Instagram and Snapchat befriended the startup. The Bieber affiliation gave it credibility, and co-founder John Shahidi’s “I’m on the creator’s side” stance fostered trust with multi-million view video makers like Lele Pons and Rudy Mancuso. Shahidi discovered that as long as these web celebs kept pumping out funny skits, their fans would follow them from one social media platform to the next. So over the past few months, Shots has rebranded as Shots Studios, and turned its focus from apps to the content people share on them. It’s taken stars who built their fame in still Instagrams, 6-second Vines and off-the-cuff Snapchat clips, and helped them shoot high-production four-minute YouTube videos. The result? Millions of views per video, strong ad revenue and, according to a source close to the company, sudden partnership interest from Facebook, Netflix and Verizon that could potentially spill into acquisition talks. With the help of Shots Studios, former Vine star Lele Pons racks up millions of views on her YouTube videosShots has now signed deals with social stars Lele Pons, Rudy Mancuso and his show Awkward Puppets and Anwar Jabawi. They have exclusive deals with Shots which takes a revenue cut of their earnings that John Shahidi wouldn’t specify but that he called “creator friendly”. In exchange, creators get access to a production team including a film crew, writers, and editors; brand management; sales help; and access to Shots’ data and growth teams. While the startup declined to comment on specific discussions, Shots Studios insists that they are not focused on selling the company right now. Their new business model has been building momentum and the company is a few months away from profitability, due to ads and partnerships with Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and American Express. Shots will still run its app, but the team is concentrating on video production and distribution. Related Articles More Than A Selfie App, Shots Produces Original Videos With Puppets (And Bieber) Shots acquires Mindie to build a teen video app empire Justin Bieber-Backed "Shots Of Me" Launches Selfie Sharing App Content creation has become a growing business, with mobile video consumption skyrocketing in the past few years thanks to better cameras, screens and wireless networks. Advertisers are looking to reach these viewers, particularly in the young demographic that Shots caters to, and video ads pay much more than their annoying banner cousins. If executed correctly, Shots’ plan could ultimately lead to a big exit for the company. Maker Studios was acquired by Disney for more than $500 million. Fullscreen also found a lucrative outcome.  Anything at or above that original $150 million price Twitter dangled would be a big win for Shots’ investors. It has raised $15 million in funding; investors include 500 Startups, Floyd Mayweather and Major League Baseball. And Shots’ most famous investor, Justin Bieber, is more involved than ever. The star got his own start on YouTube and we’re told that he’s very enthusiastic about helping the next generation of artists. And that concept of creating as a team could be Shots’ greatest strength. Each of its affiliated stars do cameos in each others’ videos and cross-promote them to their own fans. That strategy let the Shots family of stars become the oligarchy ruling Vine’s Popular page. Now the startup will give them the spotlight for a lot longer than six seconds. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Shots Studios Founded 2013 Overview Shots Studios is a data-driven entertainment company that creates comedy sketches and music for Millennials.
