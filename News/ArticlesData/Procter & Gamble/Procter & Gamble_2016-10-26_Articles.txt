Returns to Growth The consumer-goods titan delivered organic sales growth across all of its major business divisions. Joe Tenebruso (TMFGuardian) Oct 27, 2016 at 4:46PM Image source: Procter & Gamble. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) reported fiscal 2017 first-quarter results on Oct. 25. The owner of brands such as Gillette razors and Crest toothpaste enjoyed a rebound in sales growth, as well as solid profit and cash flow generation. What happened with Procter & Gamble this quarter? Organic sales -- which exclude the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, and divestitures -- rose 3%. The growth was broad-based, with organic sales increasing in all five of P&G's business segments. And, importantly, P&G's sales growth was driven mostly by higher shipment volumes, rather than price increases, which signifies increasing demand for P&G's products. Foreign currency movements did, however, weigh on Procter & Gamble's results. These currency fluctuations reduced sales by 3 percentage points, which is why P&G's reported revenue was essentially flat year over year at $16.5 billion. Profitability also continues to improve. On a currency-neutral basis, "core" (a measure that adjusts for restructuring and other non-recurring charges) gross margin and operating profit margin increased 130 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively, mainly due to productivity cost savings. That helped constant-currency core earnings per share, which rose 12% to $1.10. "Our first quarter results mark a good start to the fiscal year," said Chairman and CEO David Taylor in a press release. "We delivered broad-based organic sales growth improvement across product categories and markets, as well as strong cost savings." Cash flow and capital returns Importantly, Procter & Gamble's cash flow generation remains strong, with first-quarter operating cash flow exceeding $3 billion and free cash flow surpassing $2.3 billion. The company remains committed to passing this cash on to shareholders, as demonstrated by the $1 billion of share repurchases and $1.9 billion in dividend payments that P&G conducted during the quarter. Looking forward Procter & Gamble reiterated its full-year fiscal 2017 guidance, including all-in sales growth of approximately 1%. Organic sales are still expected to increase 2%, with foreign exchange and minor-brand divestitures projected to reduce sales by 1%. Procter & Gamble also maintained its outlook for "mid-single digits" core earnings-per-share growth, compared to fiscal 2016 core EPS, of $3.67. "Earlier this month, we completed the last major step in P&G's portfolio transformation with the Beauty Brands divestiture to Coty Inc.," added Taylor. "We are now focusing all our efforts on 10 large, structurally attractive categories where P&G holds leading positions. We're pleased with the progress we're making, but there is still more work to do to get back to the levels of balanced top- and bottom-line growth and cash generation that will consistently put P&G shareholder value creation among the best in our industry." That top-line growth will be vital if Procter & Gamble is to deliver market-beating returns to investors going forward, as cost-cutting can only go so far. Management's commitment to funneling cost savings into increased marketing and innovation-focused investments should help in that regard, as should P&G's more streamlined brand and organizational structure. Still, sales growth will remain an uphill challenge for P&G due to tepid global growth in the packaged consumer goods industry as a whole, as well as increasing competition, particularly in the e-commerce space. As such, Procter & Gamble, with its 3% dividend yield, is likely a better choice for those seeking a relatively stable income-producing investment, rather than for those looking for growth.

Management Wants You to Know Executives recently opened up about why growth was so solid last quarter and the major challenges ahead that P&G is facing. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Oct 27, 2016 at 11:17AM Image source: Getty Images. No business is too large or too widely followed to surprise investors from time to time. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), the $240 billion consumer goods giant, jumped higher this week after posting strong revenue growth to kick off its new fiscal year. Organic sales improved by 3% to mark the company's best result on that metric in over two years. After the earnings announcement, CFO Jon Moeller held a conference call with analysts to chat about the market-moving results. Here are some key investor takeaways from that discussion. Building momentum Organic sales grew in each region and in nine of the 10 largest markets. P&G managed several important wins this quarter. Growth improved overall to a 3% pace from 2% last quarter and 1% in the previous quarter. Those gains were broad based, as they included improvements across all markets and every product category. The U.S. was an especially strong geography at 3% growth. The fabric care division, anchored by Tide detergent, turned in the best individual showing at 5% gain. P&G didn't need to rely on price hikes to get those higher revenue results, either. It enjoyed strong volume growth even as rival Unilever saw its sales volumes turn lower. Soft spots We still have work remaining in some categories and markets to get our brands back to market levels of growth. There were plenty of stumbles this quarter, though. P&G lost share in two of its largest categories, hair care and baby care. It also took a step backwards in China, Russia, and the U.K., which it described as a "challenging and highly promotional market." The challenges aren't getting easier from here. Moeller said P&G is seeing geopolitical and economic volatility in areas like Egypt, Nigeria, Argentina, and the Philippines, all while competitors keep targeting its most profitable niches. P&G lost market share overall last year, and that trend could continue over the current fiscal year, even if the declines are slightly smaller. The portfolio we want This marks the completion of the most significant portfolio transformation in P&G's history. With its multibillion-dollar sale of beauty brands to Coty, P&G effectively finished its portfolio redesign. The company now owns about 100 fewer franchises, and so should be much easier to manage. Image source: P&G. There should be significant financial payoffs from the transformation as well. The brands that are left are growing at about 1 percentage point faster and with profit margins that are 2 percentage points higher than the company average. P&G chose these because the company has structural advantages with them such as dominant market share and favorable relationships with retailers. Cost savings We're driving productivity improvement up-and-down the income statement, and across the balance sheet. You might think that, after years of slicing billions of dollars out of its cost structure, P&G would have already picked all the low-hanging fruit in terms of shedding expenses. However, if anything, the company sees more opportunity ahead to boost productivity. After saving $1.4 billion per year in cost of goods in each of the last five fiscal years, management believes it can save as much as $2 billion per year through fiscal 2021. PG cost of goods sold (TTM) data by YCharts. The funds are being plowed back into initiatives that support long-term growth, including research and development, marketing, and trial-building programs. Cash is coming Fiscal 2017 will be a year of significant value returned to share owners. Thanks to its incredible cash efficiency, there's routinely plenty of money left over for investors even after executives make prudent investments in the business. This year, that math is kicked into overdrive, though, as the company raised billions of excess funds from its portfolio-shedding initiative. Management plans to spend $7 billion on dividends and nearly $15 billion on stock buybacks. Put it all together and P&G will send $22 billion to shareholders this year. That's up dramatically from its recent $15 billion annual average and enough to qualify as one of the biggest capital return plans on the market.

"Ultimately it's about winning the consumer value equation, it's working with our customers and working very hard to create and build categories as the key driver of growth, because if we do that, it's a very sustainable strategy," P&G Chairman and CEO David Taylor told CNBC. Taylor took the helm at P&G, best known for brands like Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, one year ago. The company has streamlined its portfolio in an effort to return to growth, but Taylor told CNBC in an interview that new products are also helping to drive the firm's turnaround. "If you go back 10 years ago, car air fresheners was a very small, quiet category. We introduced something called Febreze car, and it is now a quarter-billion-dollar business that's growing nicely." P&G's efforts to offer innovative new products is how, Taylor said, the firm will win market share in the U.S. and abroad. "I believe very much that it will come down ultimately to innovation that builds categories, and if we do our job better than others, we'll get a little bit of share growth. I don't subscribe to the zero sum game that says it's only about whether we can take from someone else." show chapters <p>P&amp;G CEO: Our growth brands</p> <p>Procter &amp; Gamble CEO David Taylor talks to CNBC&#039;s Sara Eisen about transformation at P&amp;G.</p> P&G CEO: Our growth brands    Thursday, 27 Oct 2016 | 5:38 AM ET | 02:25 Despite growth in all of P&G's product categories, beauty is not doing as well as the others. Taylor attributes some of that to changing consumer behaviors. Gillette is one of P&G's brands that has suffered, as facial hair has become more trendy. "There is a societal trend in many countries of more facial hair, and that's not great for Gillette. Although we also play in both wet and dry. We have Braun and we have Gillette, so there's a lot of trimming jobs to be done and we've got products to deal with that," Taylor explained. Other categories are seeing massive growth. The consumer product giant's Always discreet brand of adult diapers is its fastest growing product, and Taylor said the brand has allowed P&G to reach a whole new demographic.

The team takes a look at why manufacturers and other consumer goods companies bring about the product creep they later seek to control. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 26, 2016 at 3:11PM As companies adopt "SKU rationalization", the end result is often a decrease in the number of stock keeping units, or SKUs, a manufacturer offers. In the accompanying Industry Focus: Consumer Goods segment, Motley Fool analyst Vincent Shen is joined by senior Fool.com contributor Asit Sharma to discuss the three major factors that can drive a company to develop bloat in its products line in the first place. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 12, 2016. Vincent Shen: Our next supertrend has companies turning their attention, I think, a bit more into their internal operations. That's with SKU rationalization or specifically for our discussion, SKU reduction. So we'll look at this through the lens of two leading consumer products companies: Unilever and Procter & Gamble. But before we get any further than that I mentioned SKU rationalization and I think some of our listeners could probably use just a quick update or refresher on exactly what we're talking about there. Asit Sharma: Absolutely. What is an SKU? It's shorthand for "stock keeping unit" and Wikipedia has a great definition. I'm going to read this for our listeners. It's a "distinct type of item for sale." So manufacturers identify their products by unique codes that they've built. Those may actually be different than the barcodes that you see in, let's say, a grocery store when you're picking up a package to scan and pay for, but each product a manufacturer builds has this code and every time they vary the product whether it's size, color, anything, that creates a new stock keeping unit, or SKU. Shen: So, I think that with the SKUs and it kind of comes into conflict a little bit. On the one hand, we're going to talk about in this discussion how companies are working to basically make their operations more efficient, more profitable, and in some cases they are able to even boost their sales by reducing some of the offerings that they give to consumers. But in the last episode, we talked about on the customization side, giving more optionality, more potential to personalize and customize a product for each consumer, but I guess my question is can you give us an idea of how things flow through a company? We can use maybe one of the two companies, Unilever, or Procter & Gamble as an example, but how this decision in terms of what products are offered, the number of SKUs in a company's portfolio kind of flow through and can impact some of the metrics that investors are focused on generally. Sharma: It's a good question. Companies play a guessing game when they create products for a particular brand portfolio. And that guessing game is: What will the consumer want? What's the consumer's tolerance for product variation? And there are three major factors that drive the expansion of a product portfolio. First is to keep those product lines fresh and relevant. Most of us have seen the phrase "new and improved," and I guess listeners are familiar with the concept that this is all in a marketing ploy, but companies also create more products to suit the changing whims of the customer. I have these whims, and you have these whims, we may not know it, a lot of times these are internalized and it's based on what we imbibe from our culture, popular culture. Just also what's practical in our lives. Could be a very small variation on, let's say a handle of a grocery jug. We've seen milk cartons change over time. So, these whims drive product innovation as well. The third thing is product innovation. Now, when I think of product innovation, I think of a brand-new product. Because, well, innovate; you must be creating something new. But corporations look at slight variations in product packaging or say they change a formulation, add a flavor to a juice. If you are a beverage manufacturer that is a third reason. And innovation to a manufacturer can be very slight tweak. So these three factors drive that expansion of a portfolio and what we see is that in the consumer marketplace, companies will first expand their portfolios and then start to draw them back because it's an art, it's not a science. If a company had a handle on exactly how many variations of a product per each geographical region was necessary, then they would find this miraculous optimization of profit. And that's just not something that comes easily. Asit Sharma has no position in any stocks mentioned. Vincent Shen has no position in any stocks mentioned.

(Seeking Alpha) Jefferies thinks Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG)'s strong Q1 results demonstrated its bullish view on the stock. The firm maintained its Buy rating and $98 target price, implying upside of more than 12 percent. The company delivered core EPS that topped estimates by $0.05 while revenue came in line with the consensus. However, the key factor is that organic sales advanced 3 percent compared to the Street expectations of 2.4 percent. The brokerage listed the following five key takeaways from the conference call: Expects return to market growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 citing the current 3–3.5 percent market growth pace. Sees quarterly growth to be lumpy with Q2 and Q3 expected to be below Q1. Emerging markets grow 6 percent, with 4 percent and 2 percent coming from volume and price mix respectively. Developed markets delivered 2 percent growth. FabriCare grew 7 percent in North America in the first quarter. However, the company's selective portfolio management dragged down in emerging markets. Trends in China are showing improvements. In a note, Analyst Kevin Grundy said, "Macros remain volatile and investment in FY17 will constrain EPS growth, though we continue to like the set-up here with room for P&G to re-rate as org sales growth returns to industry growth rates. Maintain $98 PT and FY17-19 EPS ests., though see conservatism in P&G's guide."

Jeanne Yurman reports. Video Transcript Strong demand for baby, feminine, and home care products plus solid cost cutting helped Procter & Gamble end the quarter with a profit that surpassed Wall Street expectations. The world's second largest consumer products company has been selling off money losing brands and focusing on core brands such as Tide, Pampers and Gillette to jump-start sluggish sales. Erin Lash, analyst at Morningstar. (SOUNDBITE) ERIN LASH, CFA, SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, CONSUMER PACKAGED GOODS, MORNINGSTAR, (ENGLISH) SAYING: "Not only we think that that will fuel further top line growth, but will also take complexity out of the business and enable them free up more funds to further reinvest behind their brands than what they have been able to do up to this point." P&G sold 41 of its brands, including Clairol and Wella, to Coty in a $12.5 billion deal earlier this month. It is planning to further cut costs and save as much as $10 billion over the next five years. It aims to reinvest a big chunk of those savings in new products and packaging, research and development, and growing sales. more from business   Multimedia gallery The U.S.-Mexico border now gallery Supermoon of the century AUDIO Measuring HR effectiveness in the region AUDIO Brandy Scott's TED talk on happiness AUDIO How e-commerce will succeed in the Middle East AUDIO Why success is so closely tied to happiness Advertisement Most Popular Videos 'Supermoon' spectacle wows sky-watchers 1 day ago - Reuters Videos Samsung buys Harman in $8 bln smart car push 2 days ago - Reuters Videos Goldman Sachs considers Frankfurt move 11 Nov 2016 - Reuters Videos Advertisement About zawya Contact us Copyright © 2016 Zawya.

TBWA\ Africa kicks ‘Disruption’ up a notch. Alliance Media partners with Botswana for 50th. This week’s BIG move: TBWA\Durban sweetens up with acquisition of SUGAR The Agency In a sweet deal that has seen it double its digital capability overnight, TBWA\Durban acquired SUGAR The Agency (SUGAR), a smaller operation in KwaZulu-Natal’s capital city that has positioned itself as a significant player in the digital space over the past six years. Sean Donovan, TBWA\Durban managing director, says acquiring SUGAR was aimed at increasing TBWA\Durban’s digital capacity, allowing it to become more media agnostic. “We have been building our digital capability organically over the past few years. By getting the SUGAR team on board, we were able to increase our digital team twofold from about 12 to 25 people.” Warren Haviside, former partner and executive creative director of SUGAR and now head of the TBWA\Durban digital team, says SUGAR was originally established in 2010 as a through-the-line agency to offer clients fresh ideas and quick turnaround times. “Our size meant we were agile enough to stake our claim in the digital space when digital campaigns became more sought-after.” The entire SUGAR team and its portfolio of clients such as Jägermeister SA, Jägermeister Pan-Africa, Corona Beer, AFGRI, Bidvest Insurance, Ignite Charcoal, Stella Artois, Calgro Developments, Xpanda Security and R&B Timbers, amongst others, has moved to TBWA\Durban’s offices. Who’s moved where Themba Nobanda appointed client service director for Dentsu Aegis Network SSA  Dentsu Aegis Network has announced the appointment of Themba Nobanda, as client service director for Dentsu Aegis Network Sub-Saharan Africa. Nobanda joins the company after successfully setting up and running his own business in the golf industry called Golf4Fun. His business has seen over 1000 people being introduced to golf after 24 months of operation. With over 10 years’ experience in the marketing industry, he is a seasoned ex Diageo and P&G client in the region and has worked across sub Saharan Africa. Under his leadership at Diageo, Uganda Spirits Brands were rated Best Business Plan in Africa in 2014 and created a World Record of 1000 Bottles of Johnnie Walker Sold in one event (Forbes Celebration Dinner). Ahmed Tilly joints FCB Joburg in powerful new creative partnership FCB Joburg has taken a strategic decision to further bolster its creative product by bringing the highly respected and awarded Ahmed Tilly into the agency to partner executive creative director, Jonathan Deeb, in a joint chief creative officer leadership team. Making the announcement, FCB Africa’s Group CEO and group chief creative officer, Brett Morris, said the decision was on the back of FCB Joburg’s outstanding growth, having more than doubled in size over the past three years. Tilly, co-founder and ECD of Black River FC and previously creative director at The Jupiter Drawing Room Cape Town and TBWA, would be joining forces with Deeb to further enhance the agency’s creative product. “This formidable new partnership will be responsible for the overarching creative vision of the agency, driving transformation and developing young talent. Welcome, Ahmed,” said Morris. Fahmida Miller appointed Al Jazeera’s East Africa correspondent Fahmida Miller joined Al Jazeera in 2015, originally working out of the network’s Johannesburg bureau. She’s covered major stories across Africa, from the Libyan revolution to death of Nelson Mandela, but is equally at home presenting current affairs and lifestyles programmes. She’s interviewed the likes of Rwandan president Paul Kagame and former South African president Thabo Mbeki, and covered stories like the student protests in South Africa and the ongoing drought in the region. Miller previously worked at CCTV Africa, eNCA, SABC, and Kaya FM. Who’s won what  Influencer Relations: Clockwork Media partners with Webfluential Clockwork Media is set to help brands edge just a little closer to their audiences through its recently announced partnership with Webfluential, a platform connecting brands to online influencers. The partnership with Webfluential will allow Clockwork to better serve its portfolio of clients by giving them access to powerful influencer marketing. “We’ve always been focused on producing great content and pushing it through the right channels to achieve a desired result,” says Tom Manners, MD of Clockwork Media. “At the same time, we’re passionate about introducing and embracing new technology within the agency. It’s obvious that influencer marketing has become a major force within the marketing mix globally. As the world of communications continues to evolve it makes sense that agencies evolve with it.” Webfluential, another proudly South African tech start-up, has seen massive global growth since launching in 2013, and now boasts some of the world’s top businesses as clients, including Coca-Cola, Vodacom, Shell and P&G. The platform allows brand marketers to search for relevant influencers with the perfect audience for their products to boost their online reach. MobiMedia ups the game! Mobile marketing agency, MobiMedia, a division of the Ole! Media Group, has been appointed the exclusive mobile content partner for Africa for Cartoon Network’s Games portal. In addition, MobiMedia has also acquired the rights to animated video content geared towards younger mobile users from its global gaming partner with whom the company has also signed a sole distribution license. Under its Planet Games platform, MobiMedia is able to offer literally thousands of mobile games, apps, images, ringtones, and more, to over 20 000 different smartphone, feature and tablet devices to suit a number of different operating systems, including a range of over 100 HTML5 games.  The offering also includes 22 Cartoon Network games that have never been published before, marking a first for South Africa. Penny Siopis named ACT Lifetime Achievement winner Visual artist Penny Siopis was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award for her contribution to the arts at the 19th annual Arts & Culture Trust (ACT) Awards, held at Sun International’s The Maslow Hotel in Johannesburg on Friday, 21 October. Since 1975, Siopis has been exhibiting both locally and internationally. She says she is thrilled to have received this Award. “It is a wonderful recognition of my creative work, as an artist, but also a teacher.” Currently an Associate Professor in Fine Arts at UCT’s Michaelis School of Fine Art and the chairperson of the department’s governing committee, Siopis’ advice to young artists is to be committed to their beliefs but also be open to the world around them. “Take risks. Be resilient. Don’t be afraid to show your vulnerabilities,” she says. Who’s making moves Emlo introduces PR programme for interns The public relations industry is in need of new, and young, blood if it wants to keep up with the always changing trends in the world of communication. Being such a fast-paced industry it is often difficult for young graduates to secure their first job due to a lack of work experience. A PR internship programme will help solve this challenge.  “With South Africa’s unemployment rate sitting at 26,6% (Stats SA, July 2016) the responsibility to give students an opportunity to gain practical, industry-related experience lies with business owners,” says Marisa Louw, founder and managing director of Emlo. Although the agency is still in its infancy, Louw’s passion for developing young talent has led to the inception of the PR internship programme that will help students gain first-hand experience of the world of PR in an environment that is busy enough to help them grow as young PR professionals but not yet as fast-paced as the more established agencies in which they often feel overwhelmed. Undergraduates and graduates who would like to pursue a career in public relations are welcome to forward their CVs a to marisa@emlopr.co.za to apply for the PR internship programme.  Emlo is a member of the Public Relations Consultants’ Chapter (PRCC) and being a student member of the Public Relations Institute of Southern Africa (PRISA) will be an advantage for applicants. BBC Worldwide channels listed in Loeries official ranking. BBC Worldwide’s entertainment channels have been named as one of the top 20 brands in the prestigious Loeries Official Rankings 2016. The recognition is based on the local creative work that the brand has implemented in South Africa over the last 12 months to reach out to local audiences and introduce new viewers to the BBC’s award winning portfolio of content. It follows the news that the marketing team has won its first Gold and Bronze Loerie awards for its work on BBC Lifestyle’s Great South African Bake Off and BBC Brit’s Top Gear. It marks a year since the new global brands were launched to the South African market. Since then, the full channel portfolio on DStv featuring news, entertainment and lifestyle programming, has gone from strength to strength. BBC Worldwide opened its African office in Johannesburg in January 2015, and in August 2015 hired its first in-country senior marketing manager, Shireez Latief who has successfully introduced a South African voice to its marketing strategy. Mbeki & Rupert to address SA’s 2016 Sunday Times Top 100 Companies Awards Former South African president, Thabo Mbeki, has been confirmed to deliver the keynote address at the prestigious Sunday Times Top 100 Companies awards event next month, where Dr Johann Rupert – chairman of Swiss-based luxury-goods company Richemont and South Africa-based Remgro – will accept the Sunday Times Top 100 Companies Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of his contribution to the country’s economy.

The shopper marketing business unit of Y&R South Africa has not only reeled in new business (with six major client wins spanning across 22 separate brands), but has built a formidable shopper marketing team over the last two years. In July 2016, it was also announced that Labstore SA would form the shopper marketing leg of the newly formed VML and Y&R Africa Group entity, together with Y&R South Africa and digital specialist, NATIVE VML. “Becoming the shopper specialist nestled within such a powerful and globally rooted Group is a significant milestone for us,” says Carolyn White, MD of Labstore South Africa and Africa. “It signals an industry shift in the sense that shopper marketing is no longer seen as just the in-store activation space, nor ideation in shopper channels only. Shopper-led strategic insights into consumer behaviour and the need for multi-channel solutions that connects brands and experiences, are becoming paramount,” she explains. TBWA\ Africa kicks ‘Disruption’ up a notch Only businesses with strong fundamentals, a consistent approach and gutsy resilience have been able to weather the particularly tough business environment in sub-Saharan Africa over the past 12 months, and they are going to have to maintain a robust constitution for the foreseeable future, says TBWA’s Director of Africa Operations, Graham Cruikshanks. He says breaking through the negative sentiment of a difficult 2015 and 2016 has been challenging for all businesses in Africa, but TBWA’s decision to re-boot its proprietary Disruption® tool across its Africa network in 2015 paid dividends. “The move saw offices transformed and processes modified. There is a palpable sense that Disruption® is more deeply embedded throughout our business than ever before.” Speaking ahead of TBWA\ Africa’s annual Africa Conference, Cruikshanks says the group intends to kick Disruption® up a notch when it hosts its 2016 conference in Windhoek at the end of the month. “This is in line with TBWA\’s global 21st century ambition to use Disruption® as the engine to drive growth by attracting 21st century brands. This year’s conference will see Cruikshanks and his team share global updates as well as TBWA’s own Disruption® Roadmap for the business and how it translates for Africa. Alliance Media partners with Botswana for 50th Botswana celebrates its 50th year of independence this month and Alliance Media, who has been operating in Botswana for 18 years of this period, is joining in the celebrations.

(Seeking Alpha) Following Procter & Gamble Co's (NYSE: PG) quarterly results, Goldman Sachs said the management's efforts are beginning to bear fruit. Improved business efforts include streamlining the company's cost structure, material pruning of portfolio, a new CEO, modest organizational realignment and overhaul of incentive compensation down to market activation level. Q3 Review, Improvement May Be Unsustainable Analyst Jason English noted that the company reported better than expected Q1 EPS on better organic sales growth and also reiterated its full year guidance. However, English is of the view that this is unlikely to be a sustained turn, given the historical pattern of unsustained improvement and the easier comparisons for the quarter. Although believing that real improvement is afoot, the firm feels it would translate into a middle-of-the-pack algorithm of low-single-digit sales and mid-to-high EPS growth beyond. Given the company's relative premium to other global mega-cap staples companies, the firm thinks the company needs to deliver more to drive relative outperformance. The firm has a Neutral view on shares, but raised its price target to $92 from $90.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Oct 25, 2016 at 7:46PM Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is on a roll. The consumer goods giant this week posted its fastest pace of quarterly sales growth in nearly three years. And, despite a sluggish overall industry, P&G managed to boost market share while producing solid earnings gains as well. Here's how the big-picture results stacked up against the prior-year period:  Metric Q3 2016 Actuals Q3 2015 Actuals Growth (YOY) Revenue $16.5 billion $16.5 billion N/A Net income $2.76 billion $2.64 billion 5% Earnings per share $0.96 $0.93 6% Data source: P&G financial filings. YOY = year over year. Sales growth is up Reported revenue was flat, but organic growth, which strips out the impact of currency changes and brand divestments, rose at a healthy 3% clip. That marked P&G's best showing since the first quarter of 2014. Image source: Getty Images. The company can also claim some solid momentum on this key metric: Organic growth was flat nine months ago before stepping up to a 1% quarterly pace, followed by a 2% pace last quarter. P&G is even outpacing rivals, for a change. Unilever (NYSE:UL) recently announced a sales growth slowdown as organic gains fell to a 3% rate from the 5% clip the company had enjoyed for over a year. Unilever endured a rare sales volume dip, too. Procter & Gamble, in contrast, enjoyed its second straight quarter of volume-driven growth as the metric rose in each of its five main product categories, led by a 5% jump in the healthcare segment. Costs are down Costs continued to trend lower, thanks to management's multiyear effort to slice billions of dollars out of its expense structure. Cost of goods sold fell as a percentage of sales, which kept the company right on track to deliver its target of $2 billion of annual savings. PG Cost of Goods Sold (TTM) data by YCharts. Cutting against those gains was an uptick in advertising spending. Management has credited the increased marketing support for helping drive sales gains, and so the company is likely to continue trading higher organic growth for lower operating profits. Still, the bottom line improved despite the flat revenue and higher advertising spend. P&G's net profit margin ticked up by nearly a full percentage point, to 16.4% of sales, despite the negative impact of currency swings. Over $1 billion of stock repurchases, meanwhile, helped power a 6% jump in per-share earnings. Management's focus Executives sounded pleased with P&G's performance. "Our first quarter results mark a good start to the fiscal year," CEO David Taylor said in a press release. "We delivered broad-based organic sales growth improvement across product categories and markets, as well as strong cost savings." P&G's 10 core product categories. Image source: P&G investor presentation. Management also highlighted its recent sale of beauty brands to Coty that marked the effective end of its two-year brand-shedding initiative. Now the company is targeting just 66 franchises (down from 165) that Taylor and his team believe have the best prospects for sales growth and profitability. "We are now focusing all our efforts on 10 large, structurally attractive categories where P&G holds leading positions," executives said. Looking ahead P&G still has plenty of work ahead before investors can call the turnaround a success, though. After all, the company left its full-year sales growth outlook unchanged at 2%, which implies that executives see a slowdown ahead over the next nine months. However, this report provides the strongest evidence yet that P&G's growth trend is finally starting to improve. The company has now logged two straight quarters of sales volume gains, and market-share gains are evident in categories like healthcare, and fabric and home care. So it seems likely that P&G will soon return to the level of balanced growth that management has aimed for, but not achieved, in years.

Third-quarter earnings continued to dominate the market and some of the biggest companies either reported disappointing results or lowered their expectations. Investors wondered if consumers will spend less money on home improvement, clothing and other goods. But companies including Procter & Gamble and Lockheed Martin soared after their reports. Looking for safer options, some investors bought bonds and utility company shares. Consumer spending is critical to the U.S. economy and poor results for consumer-focused companies could be a sign of trouble. But Doug Roman, managing director of equities for PNC Capital Advisors, said it’s too soon to know if shoppers are closing their wallets. “The market might be extrapolating bigger stories into broader themes, which might not be the case,” he said. Corporate earnings have been falling for more than a year, and despite Tuesday’s results, investors are growing hopeful that streak is ending. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 8.17 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,143.16. The Nasdaq composite fell 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. Paint and coatings maker Sherwin-Williams posted a disappointing profit and cut its annual guidance because of slower sales growth combined with spending on new stores. Meanwhile appliance maker Whirlpool’s results fell far short of analyst projections. Sherwin-Williams had its worst day in seven years as it lost $30.27, or 10.9 percent, to $247.61. Whirlpool, which owns Maytag and KitchenAid, sank $18.37, or 10.8 percent, to $152.09, its largest loss in five years. Home improvement retailers Home Depot and Lowe’s and flooring maker Mohawk Industries all slumped. So did automaker General Motors, which reported solid earnings. Under Armour reported its slowest sales growth in six years and said its future sales won’t be as strong as it expected a year ago. Its stock tumbled $5.01, or 13.2 percent, to $32.89, its biggest drop in almost eight years. Rival Nike also slipped. Meanwhile a report showed that consumer confidence fell in October as consumers got a bit more pessimistic about business conditions and their employment prospects. The Conference Board had said consumer confidence reached a 20-month high in September. Procter & Gamble, which makes Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, had its best day in more than a year after it reported better results than investors expected. The consumer products giant has been selling some businesses to cut costs, and it posted stronger sales of personal care products like toothbrushes and deodorants. Its stock rose $2.87, or 3.4 percent, to $86.97, Aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin surpassed investor forecasts and raised its projections for the year. Its stock gained $17.10, or 7.4 percent, to $249.26, its biggest leap in seven years. The reports continued to stream in after the market closed. Apple reported lower quarterly sales and sold fewer iPhones, sending its stock down about 2 percent in late trading. The company did give a better-than-expected forecast for the holiday season. Oil and gas drilling services company Baker Hughes disclosed a smaller loss than investors expected. Investors were also pleased that Baker Hughes is preparing to cut more costs. The company said it plans to eliminate $650 million in spending this year, up from the $500 million it had planned to cut. It climbed $2.24, or 4.3 percent, to $54.39. Waters Corp., which makes products used in drug development, announced weak revenue as demand from governments, research institutions and industries fell. The stock slid $19.15, or 12.1 percent, to $138.60. Drugmaker Merck raised its forecasts after it reported a bigger profit on greater sales of vaccines and cancer medicines. The company has also been trying to keep is spending in check. The stock rose $1.20, or 2 percent, to $61.95. 3M, which makes Post-it notes, industrial coatings and ceramics, forecast weaker sales growth and a smaller profit for the year. The stock declined $5.04, or 2.9 percent, to $166.23. Elevator and jet engine manufacturer United Technologies raised its annual forecast after its third-quarter profit surpassed analyst estimates. Its stock gained $1.84, or 1.8 percent, to $101.36. Media and marketing information company Nielsen took its biggest loss ever after it reported shaky results and cut its guidance. Nielsen stock tumbled $9.28, or 16.9 percent, to $45.65. Benchmark U.S. crude lost 56 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $49.96 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 67 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $50.79 a barrel in London. Bond prices edged higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.76 percent from 1.77 percent. Investors also bought shares of utility companies. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline stayed at $1.50 a gallon. Heating oil lost 2 cent to $1.56 a gallon. Natural gas sank 6 cent, or 2 percent, to $2.77 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold rose $9.90 to $1,273.60 an ounce. Silver jumped 18 cents, or 1 percent, to $17.78 an ounce. Copper rose 5 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $2.14 a pound. The dollar slipped to 104.22 yen from 104.24 yen. The euro rose to $1.0892 from $1.0879. In Britain the FTSE 100 rose 0.4 percent while France’s CAC 40 lost 0.3 percent and the DAX in Germany was little changed. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.8 percent and South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.5 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong slipped 0.2 percent. ——— AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay     Tags: percent, stock, results, company, reported, investors, Other stories from today: New Wells Fargo CEO to employees: ‘We’re sorry’ Anger flares after judge OKs Volkswagen emissions deal Apple’s quarterly sales fall, forecast calls for gains     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   In six months, the economy will be ...

You worked with Procter & Gamble for 17 years before joining Merck in 2013. Why the transition? I never worked in healthcare before I joined Merck. It is very important to be able to relate to the category and its purpose. The contribution [Merck] gives to real people in their day-to-day lives showed me a different perspective than working on something like hair color.  How has marketing and communications changed since you joined? The first year, I wanted to see what moves consumers, doctors, and pharmacists by intentionally and significantly emotionalizing our communications. We wanted to visually soften our comms but also use terminology and ideas that speak to the heart versus speaking to the left brain, which is masculine, binary, and black and white. Around 2014, we decided to use every opportunity to position our brands as sympathy holders — the ones who care, listen, understand, and hold hands with consumers. We called them "Love Brands." At Cannes this year, Merck launched the WE100 platform. What inspired it? Love Brands was WE100's precursor. We want to prepare society for a new era where people live 100 years. Life expectancy has picked up significantly since the 1960s, even in the least developed country. But the legislative environment, government, system that is overlooking people has barely changed. You go from school to a job, the rest is smooth sailing and counting our days to the grave once you retire. What shaped the strategy? We placed a big study to find out the pain point and needs of people in this context. That shapes the content we are chewing on and about to roll out in Europe and Africa. WE100 is about the right of everybody to look forward to 100 great years and ask their governments for all the support they need. At Cannes, I was trying to find partners in crime that without any financial expectations, out of the goodness of their hearts, will help us out — such as the media industry, pharmaceutical industry, and even royalty such as [Queen Elizabeth II] and the Pope. His endorsement could be a great help for families to take this seriously for their kids. What initiatives do you have coming up around that? Healthy Hour is about raising awareness and teaching kids how to prepare for a 100-year life versus just learning about the next 20 years and how you can be good in math, physics, biology, and maybe literature so you can nail the best college and job. We are kicking that off in Africa this fall with support and engagement from governments over there. We are relying on pharmacists and doctors who in smaller villages may be the teachers of the courses. Another big project is We4You, which asks Merck employees to take time off in an organized way to help the elderly and better integrate them into society. We are doing this in Europe, working with the elderly on topics such as digital crash courses, knowledge about your bones, avoiding accidents, and restarting your professional life. What areas are you focused on? Women's and babies' health. Femibion is a pregnancy multivitamin. To support it, we came out with a campaign called Working Mothers, which is about recognizing the dedication of new moms to their babies that is perceived as holding back your career, turning it around, and recognizing your experience as a mom is a great qualification for a job as well. What can moms bring to the table? Skills moms have include listening, operational discipline, prioritizing, and multitasking, which are needed in the real world [for jobs ranging from] receptionist to the top manager. We have many female leaders. Our CEO, Uta Kemmerich-Keil, is a mother of two. The company has enabled her to go through her maternity leave, recognized her, and rewarded her to move forward. We have a lot of great stories from within our company that we will provocatively share with broader audiences in 2017. This is based in Germany and Austria, but we feel it is going to be universal. What came out of the first Global Consumer Health Debate you threw earlier this year?  The biggest realization is that 70% or more of big decisions are made by women. We had better understand their hopes, wishes, needs and contributions to the health industry. In terms of consumer health, they are the gatekeeper for the entire family. What's your biggest challenge from a marketing perspective? If doctors, pharmacists are not falling in love with what you say, they don't care or remember about the info you provide them. If your nose is decongested in 15 seconds or 12, who cares? It is a beautiful, wonderful story that can be passed onto the next person. It is worth tweeting about, and sharing on YouTube with your friends. That is what matters for doctors, pharmacists, and nurses. The challenge for the healthcare industry is how we digitize our interaction with doctors, healthcare professionals, and consumers. What agencies do you work with?  We work with Saatchi & Saatchi, SelectNY, and Ogilvy. From a PR perspective, Weber Shandwick helps us.

NEW YORK — Shaky results from consumer companies dragged the stock market lower Tuesday as shares of well-known names like appliance maker Whirlpool and athletic apparel maker Under Armour suffered their worst declines in years. Third-quarter earnings continued to dominate the market, and some of the biggest companies either reported disappointing results or lowered their expectations. Investors wondered if consumers will spend less money on home improvement, clothing and other goods. But companies including Procter & Gamble and Lockheed Martin soared after their reports. Looking for safer options, some investors bought bonds and utility company shares. Consumer spending is critical to the economy, and poor results for consumer-focused companies could be a sign of trouble. But Doug Roman, managing director of equities for PNC Capital Advisors, said it's too soon to know if shoppers are closing their wallets. “The market might be extrapolating bigger stories into broader themes, which might not be the case,” he said. Corporate earnings have been falling for more than a year, and despite the results, investors are growing hopeful that streak is ending. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.17 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,143.16. The Nasdaq composite fell 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. Paint and coatings maker Sherwin-Williams posted a disappointing profit and cut its annual guidance because of slower sales growth combined with spending on new stores. Meanwhile appliance maker Whirlpool's results fell far short of analyst projections. Sherwin-Williams had its worst day in seven years as it lost $30.27, or 10.9 percent, to $247.61. Whirlpool, which owns Maytag and KitchenAid, sank $18.37, or 10.8 percent, to $152.09, its largest loss in five years. Home improvement retailers Home Depot and Lowe's and flooring maker Mohawk Industries all slumped. So did automaker General Motors, which reported solid earnings. Under Armour reported its slowest sales growth in six years and said its future sales won't be as strong as it expected a year ago. Its stock tumbled $5.01, or 13.2 percent, to $32.89, its biggest drop in almost eight years. Rival Nike also slipped. Meanwhile a report showed that consumer confidence fell in October as consumers got a bit more pessimistic about business conditions and their employment prospects. The Conference Board had said consumer confidence reached a 20-month high in September. Procter & Gamble, which makes Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, had its best day in more than a year after it reported better results than investors expected. The consumer products giant has been selling some businesses to cut costs, and it posted stronger sales of personal care products such as toothbrushes and deodorants. Its stock rose $2.87, or 3.4 percent, to $86.97, Aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin surpassed investor forecasts and raised its projections for the year. Its stock gained $17.10, or 7.4 percent, to $249.26, its biggest leap in seven years. The reports continued to stream in after the market closed. Apple reported lower quarterly sales and sold fewer iPhones, sending its stock down about 2 percent in late trading. The company did give a better-than-expected forecast for the holiday season. Oil and gas drilling services company Baker Hughes disclosed a smaller loss than investors expected. Investors were also pleased that Baker Hughes is preparing to cut more costs. The company said it plans to eliminate $650 million in spending this year, up from the $500 million it had planned to cut. It climbed $2.24, or 4.3 percent, to $54.39. Waters Corp., which makes products used in drug development, announced weak revenue as demand from governments, research institutions and industries fell. The stock slid $19.15, or 12.1 percent, to $138.60. Drugmaker Merck raised its forecasts after it reported a bigger profit on greater sales of vaccines and cancer medicines. The company has also been trying to keep is spending in check. The stock rose $1.20, or 2 percent, to $61.95. 3M, which makes Post-it notes, industrial coatings and ceramics, forecast weaker sales growth and a smaller profit for the year. The stock declined $5.04, or 2.9 percent, to $166.23. Elevator and jet engine manufacturer United Technologies raised its annual forecast after its third-quarter profit surpassed analyst estimates. Its stock gained $1.84, or 1.8 percent, to $101.36. Media and marketing information company Nielsen took its biggest loss ever after it reported shaky results and cut its guidance. Nielsen stock tumbled $9.28, or 16.9 percent, to $45.65. Benchmark U.S. crude lost 56 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $49.96 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 67 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $50.79 a barrel in London. Bond prices edged higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.76 percent from 1.77 percent. Investors also bought shares of utility companies. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline stayed at $1.50 a gallon. Heating oil lost 2 cent to $1.56 a gallon. Natural gas sank 6 cent, or 2 percent, to $2.77 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold rose $9.90 to $1,273.60 an ounce.

Hindustan Unilever (HUL), the country's largest consumer goods company, is eyeing new product categories in a quest for more growth. At an analysts' conference call on Wednesday, the company indicated it would introduce the Dollar Shave Club razor brand into India at an "opportune time". It has already extended the presence of its Dove brand into the baby skin care category, with bars, lotions and wet wipes. While a schedule for introduction of the Dollar Shave Club was not indicated, most analysts expect HUL to do so in the next six to eight months. It already has a presence in the overall Rs 5,000-crore male grooming market in India, with brands such as Fair & Lovely Men, Pond's for Men and Axe. A razor brand was a key missing link and will pit HUL directly against Procter & Gamble's Gillette, leader in the Rs 2,000-crore shaving category, a sub-segment of the overall male grooming market. As a category, male grooming has been growing at 20-25 annually and is expected to maintain this pace as more men aspire to look good. Dollar Shave was acquired by parent Unilever this July in a $1-billion acquisition, its second-largest American purchase after its $3.7-bn buying of beauty major Alberto Culver in 2011. Unilever had introduced one of Alberto Culver's popular brands, Tresemme, into India within two years of acquisition. It is now a key part of HUL's hair care portfolio, with annual sale of Rs 150-200 crore, say analysts. When announcing the September quarter results on Wednesday, Managing Director Sanjiv Mehta had said hair care growth was led by Dove and Tresemme, despite personal care as a whole being affected by the performance of soaps. And, that Dove's extension into the baby category was the right time to do so, as it had in the past decade established itself as a trustworthy brand, having entered the categories of body care, skin care, hair care and deodorants. Dove's extension into the baby category will imply a direct collision with Johnson & Johnson, the market leader.

Sprint's Improvement Needs To Pick Up The Pace Citi: Operational rebound means tougher case for Sprint/T-Mobile tie-up (Seeking Alpha) Sprint is once again the most shorted stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Its share price popped 6 percent in the most recent settlement period. Short sellers bailed on the former king of the hill in early October. In the most recent short interest settlement period, Sprint Corp (NYSE: S) regained its title as the most shorted stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Even though the number of its shares short dwindled by more than 6 million between September 30 and October 14, the previous king of the hill, Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) saw an even sharper drop in shares sold short -- more than 67 percent! Kansas-based telecommunications giant Sprint saw the number of its shares short shrink 3.8 percent to more than 161.07 million shares in the first half of the month. That was still a whopping 25.4 percent of the total float. At the most recently average daily volume, it would take about nine days to cover all short positions. During the period, Sprint was among companies that benefited from the recent launch of the latest iPhones. The share price ended the two-week short interest period about 6 percent higher, while the S&P 500 was down less than 2 percent. The stock now is up about 74 percent since the beginning of the year.

In this video from Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, the cast discusses how Unilever is working to control the impact of proliferating product variations on its business. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 12, 2016. Vincent Shen: I think it's important to point out that with every item that a company offers essentially, that has costs and investments associated with it. Think the storage of your completed product and the materials needed to create it, packaging, your supplier relationships, the marketing of your offerings, and also disposal in some cases for some products or SKUs that have gone obsolete. So every dollar a company spends toward one SKU that would have been better spent on another will potentially result in a reduction in the top or bottom line. Or both. So, I think for publicly traded companies, it's fair to say that investors and shareholders place a high value on also the predictability and accurate guidance from management. I think you had mentioned earlier a little bit about forecasts; if you have an overabundance of offerings and SKUs, I think it becomes increasingly difficult to essentially forecast out your expected sales and that can reduce profitability if discounting, for example, is needed to reduce stock or you have to send additional stocks to suppliers because items sold out unexpectedly. And let's jump directly into one of our two companies. Let's start with Unilever. No. 3 consumer-goods product company by revenue, behind Procter & Gamble and Nestle. Can you tell us a little bit about their efforts and how they've approached SKU rationalization? Asit Sharma: Sure. So, our supertrend for today is this idea of shrinking SKUs or SKU rationalization and why it's a supertrend and why Unilever is such a great example. We, in our last episode, separated the idea of just a trend from the idea of supertrend by saying if many corporations are out there jumping on this trend and they're both big and small, that is a great indication we're seeing a supertrend. Unilever fits right in because they're one of the biggest, baddest consumer goods companies on the planet. They have hundreds of brands and literally thousands and thousands of SKUs, and they practice what Vince has mentioned a couple times: SKU rationalization. Let's quickly define that term if you're not familiar with it. It's a really simple concept. SKU rationalization is when you use data and analytics to pare down those underperforming SKUs and then you transfer your resources into the SKUs which are getting market share. So we're going to use this term a lot, and it's a great way to sound really smart if you're talking to other investors; you can talk about SKU rationalization and your favorite companies. Unilever's multiyear goal is to reduce their SKU by 20%. When you visualize a company which is in hundreds of countries around the globe dealing with local markets, you can imagine the complexity of their operation. So for a company like this to decide to reduce SKUs ... well, let me stop here. Last week we talked about Nike, which I also call "nyke," SKUs are often pronounced as "skews," so if you hear me start saying "skews," same thing. But this multiyear goal sprung from management's realization that if we undertake this investment, we may reduce revenue somewhat but we're going to have more profitable products. I'd like to talk about one case study. This is something that happened several years ago, when Unilever's U.K. and Irish units combined into one group. When they got together, this was around 2008 to 2009, and they performed an analysis of their SKUs and they found that 60% of product variance contributed just 5% of their sales, but that made up 20% of inventory. And Vince, I know you had also seen that case study. What are your thoughts about that? That really opened my eyes to why a company should jump in and perform SKU rationalization. Shen: Yeah, those numbers -- notably the 5% of sales and the 20% of inventory -- is unbelievable. This case that you mentioned, I think it was from 2008 to 2009, but even as recently as 2014 Unilever still had about 50,000 SKUs in its portfolio. So it's a monumental task. You know, keeping track of that, managing that, and the fact that, as we'll get into more detail, about how the company and specifically the U.K. and Irish units kind of approached this issue. Really, the results you'll see have had a very direct impact on their financial performance. Asit Sharma has no position in any stocks mentioned. Vincent Shen has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink club catalyst From start-up to ‘scaled up’ NIMISH DWIVEDI BUSINESS DIRECTOR CARDS AND PAYMENTS VP BANK-FE CREDIT   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Gangster/shutterstock.com ‘Got funding’, ‘valuation’ et al are passe. How about saying start-ups are those that sustained the show? There is no denying that India’s e-commerce start-up “ecosystem” has come a long way. From a time when the only source of funding available to start-ups was the capital that passionate founders had to put together from friends and family, the situation has changed so dramatically that today funds chase ideas. Indian start-ups have acquired valuations which make them bigger than manufacturing companies that have been listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange for decades. But a serious moment of self-reflection happened for this sector during the first half of 2016, besides dismaying tales of employees getting downsized or ventures going belly up. And while there has been a fair amount of focus on the financial indicators by which start-ups need to be assessed post that moment, there has not been much talk about their current brand attributes versus desired brand attributes to make this a vibrant and vital sector of the economy.Forget ‘Funding’ The first brand attribute that needs to be recast is ‘Funding.’ In a gold-rush like mentality, many investors will put in money in half-baked ideas, hoping for an exit. Take the tiny example amongst many funded start-ups, of TinyOwl, the food ordering app which got $16 million of Series B funding after an initial $4 million in Series A. Even an esteemed publication like Techcrunch announced this funding with the following additional information conveying TinyOwl’s potential — “India’s food ordering space is just one market booming in response to the growth of smartphones and mobile internet access in the county. An IDC report found India the fastest growing smartphone market in Asia — over 23 million smartphones were shipped in Q3 2014, according to the firm, which represented an 82 per cent growth on one year previously.” We all know how the TinyOwl story ended. This attribute of “Got Funding” where the amount of funding obtained defines the buzz around a start-up needs to be totally recast into the attribute of “Sustained and Scaled start-ups.” The biggest brand attribute that needs to be built for the start-up ecosystem is to make an example of start-ups that have sustained and scaled over three or may be five years. After all, the failure rate of start-ups is 90 per cent and if we add the factor of inability to scale, then that rate may go beyond 95 per cent. India needs to know stories of start-ups that have not just sustained but also scaled significantly beyond three to five years by building a solid business. And it is these sustaining start-ups that need to be encouraged to go to campuses as they can not only provide a learning ground for freshers but also allow these freshers to channelise their change-the-world ideas.Let’s drop ‘valuation’ The second brand attribute that needs to be recast is “Valuation”. This “valuation” attribute needs to change into the attribute of “Unique or Well Adapted Proposition.” For decades, the cornerstone of success in India for global giants like Colgate Palmolive, Unilever, Procter and Gamble and Cadbury’s has been their ability to adapt their core propositions and make them relevant both in terms of product formulation and packaging. Think Sunsilk Sachets to Colgate Tooth Powder and the unique messaging adaptation of their core brand values. Who can forget the “Kuch Khaas Hain” campaign from Cadbury’s attempting to take chocolate consumption away from being just children-centric to young adults and doing it with a very Indian tone. Now think of the adapted propositions in the e-commerce space. Most of them are just blind clones from other markets. If we look at the 9 unicorns in India which have a valuation of $1 billion, then one realises that only Paytm, Inmobi, Zomato, Mu Sigma and Ola stand out in terms of “unique or well-adapted propositions.” Inmobi and Mu Sigma are absolutely unique in the mobile advertising and analytics space while Paytm has adapted the concept of digital wallets for Indian markets. Ola has done the same for cab hailing and Zomato for restaurant listing and reviews. Others are mere clones of Amazon, ebay, Craigslist or many such global companies. That creates vulnerability for these unicorns, given India's distinct market dynamics and consumer preferences but also provides a window for them to adapt and innovate.Beware discounts The other attribute that has got associated with today's start ups is “Deep Discounting.” The only aspect that draws customers to these e-commerce sites is discounts. And when the funding dries up, the discounts disappear, the valuation plunges and the vicious cycle of lay-offs and closures begins. The attribute that this needs to be converted into is “Customer Experience.” Even if the start-up has a brilliant, game changing idea, if the execution and linked customer experience do not match up, then the start-up will not sustain. For all B2C e-commerce brands, the reference shifts to Amazon. But Amazon has been investing for years in never-before customer engagement algorithms to provide an unprecedented shopping experience at one end and in creating an incredible logistical infrastructure to deliver ahead of customer expectations at the other end. Speaking to Amazon’s physical growth, Jeff Bezos said in a rare interview that much of Amazon’s profit goes directly back into development projects aimed to take Amazon even closer to its customers. Fulfilment centres geared around ultra-quick online-to-doorstep delivery and pick-up services are one such investment Bezos considers an important link between online and offline convenience. Today, apps in India and sites claim food delivery in 30 minutes in India’s crowded cities but except for putting pressure on a poor delivery boy on a bike, there is no clarity on what they are doing differently to support this claim. Stories of such start-ups need to move away from this unsubstantiated claim and focus on whether they have done anything at all differently to deliver on such promises. Also, there is very little media focus on assessing the customer experience and satisfaction of e-commerce start-ups that have got lots of funding or have unprecedented valuations. From site experience to delivery to call centre to complaint handling, there are serious customer expectations that these start-ups need to deliver upon. Horror stories abound of unmet promises, wrong delivery of items, non-delivery and no shows and what not. There needs to be a benchmark measure of customer experience across all e-commerce start-ups that media covering the start-up sector needs to focus on. At present, media coverage is centred around making celebrities of start-up founders simply because they have secured $5 million of funding or achieved a valuation in someone's estimate of 500 million. Nothing on the user experience and the service standards of these entities. Start-ups that achieve these will not only continue to attract talent from India's top tier institutions but will never have to defer or rescind offers. And they will never be short of funding or valuations because the game changing ideas and technologies from these freshers will always help them stay a step ahead of competition.

Here are three foreign stocks investors should consider buying right now. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Oct 27, 2016 at 10:32AM Image source: Getty Images. Though investing in foreign stocks brings with it some additional risks, finding the top international stocks to buy is also a great way to find and profit from opportunities many investors overlook. Case in point, Nestle (NASDAQOTH:NSRGY), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) are some of the best foreign businesses operating today, making these names some of the top international stocks to buy today. DEO data by YCharts. Nestle: the international dividend aristocrat Nestle is a classic "boring is beautiful" kind of company, and its ability to consistently execute its straightforward business model makes it a fantastic stock for international investors who aren't seeking something highly exotic. Today, Nestle stands as the world's largest food company; it owns over 2,000 brands and 20 brands that generate over $1 billion in annual sales. Much like U.S.-based consumer staples giants Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark, Nestle manufactures and sells a wide range of goods that consumers consistently buy regardless of the state of the economy. Given its massive size, the company's global distribution system also serves as a powerful competitive advantage, enabling it to easily adapt to trends more quickly than smaller competitors. Though the company dates back to 1875, Nestle's enviable streak of consecutive annual dividend increases started nearly a century later. Since 1959, the company has grown its annual cash payouts, easily qualifying the stock as a Dividend Aristocrat. Its 3.1% dividend yield combines with this track record to make Nestle one of the more alluring dividend growth stocks among international companies on the market today. Baidu: a generational Chinese growth stock Baidu remains one of my favorite international stocks -- I personally own it -- as well as a longtime recommendation in the Fool's premium services. Plainly stated, Baidu lies at the epicenter of several of the most important technology growth markets in the world's most populous country. Known as the "Google of China," Baidu operates what is by far the most dominant search engine in China. As one measure of market share, Baidu is estimated to have generated over 80% of all search engine advertising revenue in 2015; recall that Google is officially blocked in China. Despite historic spending to drive deeper into new growth markets, the outsized profitability of Baidu's search operations still managed to produce 15% operating margins in its most recent quarters.  Still catering to a relatively small percentage of its potential advertising audience, the growth potential of Baidu's core search operations are enough to justify owning this international stock. However, Baidu's aggressive push deeper into new online services like food deliveries and more, its Google-esque development of self-driving car technology, and its deep investments into nascent technology verticals like artificial intelligence each offer massive potential payoffs for investors. The state of the Chinese economy and intense competition from other large Chinese tech companies can indeed weigh on its volatile shares, but over the long term, Baidu offers international investors one of the most appealing growth profiles anywhere in the market. MercadoLibre: Latin America's e-commerce growth stock Much like Baidu, MercadoLibre has successfully applied a proven online business model -- e-commerce in this case -- and built a dominant regional franchise around it. Since it's easy to understand, think of MercadoLibre as the "Amazon or eBay of Latin America." The company operates the continent's largest e-commerce platform, spanning 13 countries and 550 million people. What's more, its impressive recent financial performance demonstrates what makes this international growth stock such an attractive option for investors today. In its most recent quarter, MercadoLibre saw its revenue increase 29% in U.S. dollar terms, and the volume of total units sold rose 45%. Perhaps more importantly, MercadoLibre continues to establish its ancillary payments and shipping services that leading e-commerce businesses like Amazon have leveraged as competitive advantages so successfully in recent years. MercadoLibre's PayPal-esque service MercadoPago saw the number of transactions it processed rise 76% in the company's most recent quarter; its current penetration among MercadoLibre users today stands at 75%. Similarly, the shipment volume in the company's fulfillment services operation also doubled from the year prior.   In virtually every sense, MercadoLibre appears to be firing on all cylinders. Despite that success, MercadoLibre's full-year 2015 sales of $651 million accounted for just 1.5% of Latin America's estimated $40.9 billion in e-commerce sales, a number expected to double by 2019. MercadoLibre will certainly face volatility in its business, particularly given the region's long-standing history of foreign currency turmoil. Competitors like Amazon also figure to move deeper into the continent. However, with its brand credibility and customer-centric suite of offerings, MercadoLibre, like Nestle and Baidu, still stands as one of the best international stocks for long-term investors.

What students look for in employers According to the survey results, 60 % of respondents indicated career growth as one of the main factors of employer attractiveness in 2015. Besides career perspectives, students are interested in salary level, international experience, opportunities for personal and professional development and work schedule. It is worth mentioning that only 14% of students noted official employment relations (supplemented with contract) as an important employer choice criterion Where students want to work This year the survey participants independently named more than 170 companies as preferred employers to work for. Based on the survey results, the most attractive employers in 2015 were (in alphabetical order): Azercell, Azersun Holding, BP, Gilan Holding, Ministry of Labor and Social Protection, Procter & Gamble, Pasha Holding, Schlumberger, SOCAR and one of the Big 4 audit companies. It is not surprising that these are mostly large and well-known international and Azerbaijani companies, as employer attractiveness among young candidates significantly depends on their awareness about its corporate and product brands Where students get information about employers The vast majority of respondents receive information about employers from Internet sources (70%) including news from the Internet (51%), social networks (49%), ads on the internet (25%) and job portals (23%). It may be noticed, that news from the Internet and social networks are more efficient communication channels for reaching out to students than corporate websites or job portals. Difficulties that students deal with during a job search The results of the survey show that the majority of students (39%) did not have any difficulties while searching for a job or during the recruitment process. At the same time, the students who had certain difficulties most often named miscommunication with the companies as the main challenge in recruitment process (in particular, unclear candidate selection process, limited information about the company and job opportunities, unclear communications). This may be an important message to recruitment functions of the companies targeting talent in the local labor market, as the success of employer branding and recruitment strategy strongly relies on the effectiveness of communications. What students think of relocation More than 70% of students are ready to relocate abroad for employment purposes. Given a chance, 54% of them would relocate within a year and 13% - within 3 years respectively. On the other hand, a third of all students do not consider relocating abroad in the short and mid-term perspective. These results once again show that majority of the students consider the opportunities for gaining international experience as an appealing factor while choosing an employer. About the survey The Best Employer Survey is conducted by EY in Azerbaijan since 2016. The main goal of the survey is to analyze the preferences of students in choosing an employer. According to EY’s methodology, respondents are asked to independently name up to three employers in order of their attractiveness. Participants of the survey also indicate factors of employer’s attractiveness and sources of information about them, as well as answer some other questions, which help to determine the major trends on the labor market. The People Advisory Services practice at EY Azerbaijan conducts surveys to assess employer image among employees, contractors and business partners and provides consulting services on the development of employer value proposition as well as other HR related matters. About EY EY is a global leader in assurance, tax, transaction and advisory services.

In which companies do professionals choose to work and why? The Best Employer Survey 2015 conducted by EY shows that career growth is a key factor in an employer’s attractiveness for professional candidates. Over 1,400 respondents with experience in various industries took part in the survey. According to the survey, key employer choice criteria for professional candidates include opportunities for career growth (77%), as well as personal and professional development (68%). Besides these, professional candidates most frequently pay attention to corporate culture, prospects of gaining international experience, and the salary level. The key differences between the preferences of professional candidates and students included their approach to fringe benefits, which seem to be more important for professional candidates (mentioned by 34% of respondents) than they are for students (14%). Where candidates want to work Candidates named over 200 companies that they considered to be the best employers in Azerbaijan. The majority of the companies mentioned were from the FMCG, professional services and telecommunications industries. According to the professional candidates, the most attractive employers are (in alphabetical order): Azercell, BP, McKinsey & Company, PASHA Bank, PASHA Holding, PMD Group, SAIPEM, SOCAR, and some of the Big 4 companies. Where candidates get information about employers The most popular source of information about employers according to professionals is Internet resources (71%). Among these, the majority of candidates named job portals and social networks as the ones most frequently used (both sources were mentioned by 46% of respondents). Besides Internet resources, professional candidates often mentioned personal and business contacts as important sources of information. Almost 40% of respondents indicated that they got information about employers from their friends and relatives, while 20% mentioned business contacts. In addition, every third respondent received information from traditional mass media sources. Difficulties that candidates face during their job search According to the survey, the majority of candidates (46%) have not faced any difficulties in the process of job search. However, similarly to students, the professional candidates named lack of information about selection processes and employment opportunities among the key challenges, as well as miscommunication with companies. The fact that these problems were stated by both audiences (students and professional candidates) may prove that companies need to pay more attention to how they communicate their employer value proposition. What professional candidates think of relocation Almost 80% of professional candidates stated that they would like to work overseas. Contrary to students, only 16% of professional candidates are ready to relocate within the next year, whereas the majority (46%) would consider such an opportunity within the upcoming three years. The remaining 38% of respondents would not consider relocating abroad in the short to mid-term.

October 27, 2016 07:00 ET 3D Signatures Inc. Introduces Business Advisory Board and Celebrates Recent Listing by Opening Toronto Stock Exchange November 2 WINNIPEG, MB--(Marketwired - October 27, 2016) - 3D Signatures Inc. (TSX VENTURE: DXD) (the "Company" or "3DS") is pleased to introduce the following internationally renowned senior biotech executives as members of the Company's Business Advisory Board. Jonathan Goodman, Director & CEO, Knight Therapeutics Inc. Mr. Goodman is the founder and CEO of Knight Therapeutics Inc. (TSX: GUD) ("Knight" or "Knight Therapeutics"), a specialty pharmaceutical company headquartered in Quebec, Canada. Knight was established by Mr. Goodman in 2014, and has a current market cap of approximately $1.2 billion. Prior to Knight, Mr. Goodman was a co-founder, President and CEO of Paladin Labs Inc. ("Paladin Labs") which was acquired by Endo International plc (TSX: ENL) in February 2014 for $3.2 billion. Mr. Goodman was formerly a consultant with Bain & Company and also worked in brand management for Procter & Gamble. Mr. Goodman holds a B.A. from McGill University (Great Distinction) and the London School of Economics (1st Class Honours). Additionally, he holds an LL.B. and an M.B.A. from McGill University. Bringing proven international success with Paladin Labs and Knight Therapeutics, 3DS will greatly benefit from Mr. Goodman's entrepreneurial experience and global networks, both in the pharmaceutical industry and in healthcare capital markets. Knight Therapeutics is a strategic investor in 3DS. Dr. Heiner Dreismann, Past President and CEO, Roche Molecular Systems Dr. Dreismann is a seasoned executive with more than 24 years of experience in the healthcare industry, and is regarded as a pioneer in the early adoption of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, one of the most ubiquitous technologies in molecular biology and genetics research today. He had a successful career at the Roche Group from 1985 to 2006 where he held several senior positions, including President and CEO, Roche Molecular Systems, Head of Global Business Development, Roche Diagnostics, and Member of Roche's Global Diagnostic Executive Committee. At the time of his departure, Dr. Dreismann had grown Roche Molecular Systems to approximately $1.2 billion USD in annual revenue. He currently serves on the boards of several public and private health care companies. Dr. Dreismann earned a MSc degree in biology and his Ph.D in microbiology/molecular biology (summa cum laude) from Westfaelische Wilhelms University (The University of Munster) in Germany. Dr. Dreismann brings proven strategic vision and world-class diagnostics expertise to 3DS. The Company expects to benefit greatly from his substantial commercial networks and unparalleled global perspective on the medical diagnostics market. John Lindsay, Founder, SciPartners Mr. Lindsay began his career at Millipore Corporation, Merck KGaA, and quickly advanced to become the youngest Vice President in the history of the company. He was promoted to Executive Vice President of several divisions, including the Analytical Group and Milligen Biosearch Divisions. In 2000, he founded SciPartners, with the objective of building a platform for development of early stage European and North American firms. His focus is the life sciences market, and over the past 14 years he has successfully built up sales and marketing that led to rapid growth and increased revenues for many companies, and the acquisition of ProXeon by ThermoFisher as well as the acquisition of Halo Genomics by Agilent. Mr. Lindsay's history of repeated commercial success, working with major healthcare companies, as well as small and emerging life sciences companies, will greatly aid 3DS as it endeavors to become a leading diagnostic and prognostic company for cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Comments from 3DS Chairman "In a very short time, we have built an exceptional Business Advisory Board," said John Swift, Chairman, 3DS. "This speaks to the strength of our technology and to the magnitude of our business opportunity. As the Company advances its first-in-class minimally invasive tests for major diseases such as prostate cancer and Alzheimer's disease, independent guidance from the Business Advisory Board will be of tremendous assistance in making the right decisions at the right time." 3DS Opens Toronto Stock Exchange To celebrate the recent September 13, 2016 listing on TSX Venture Exchange (TSXV), members of 3DS' senior management and directors will open trading at Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) on Wednesday, November 2 at 9:30 a.m. EDT.

CoverGirl’s New ‘Cover Boy’ Shows Fashion and Beauty Industries Are Turning a Corner by Leon Kaye on Thursday, Oct 27th, 2016 Advertising & Marketing Share Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) James Charles, the new “CoverBoy.” Despite the oft-lampooned couture shows and outsized personalities that have long dominated the fashion and personal beauty industries, the reality is that these profitable sectors are socially conservative and often resistant to change. Of course, colors, patterns and silhouettes evolve over time. But overall, these industries continue to send messages to women (and arguably, men) that they must conform to a certain ideal. During the 1990s and early 2000s, the fashion and beauty industries arguably became even more reactionary. Runway shows featured thinner and thinner models, and digital technologies presented models with a look and body that, frankly, is impossible for any “normal” person to obtain. The use of models who looked emaciated in part led to the rise of the “fat acceptance” movement as more women became exhausted by large corporations dictating how they should look and feel. But the evidence suggests the norms of what is beautiful — and, quite frankly, who is allowed to feel beautiful and fabulous — are changing. And companies are beginning to take notice. One such watershed moment is CoverGirl’s recent decision to hire its first male brand ambassador. Earlier this month the 55-year-old cosmetics brand, now a subsidiary of Procter & Gamble, hired 17-year-old James Charles, a high school senior who lives in upstate New York’s Hudson Valley. The popular YouTuber and Instagram celebrity has parlayed his glam social media presence into a gig that allows him to work with the likes of Katy Perry. It’s a rapid ascent for Charles. Just last month, he became a mini-sensation on Twitter by showing how he brought a ring light to his senior picture shoot to help his cheekbones stand out. And now, only a few weeks later, he is associated with a brand that has showcased a long list of Hollywood and fashion icons, including Christie Brinkley, Rihanna, Drew Barrymore and Sofia Vergara. In a recent interview with the New York Times, Charles succinctly explained how his signing on with CoverGirl symbolizes what is going on in the world of fashion and beauty, especially for men. No, his penchant and passion for hair and make up is not some “gender-bender” experimentation. Men like Charles are not dabbling with what it is like to be a woman: They are simply dictating what it means to express themselves on their own terms. And no, despite the enduring popularity of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” Charles’ interest has nothing to do with drag performing. In his words, he’s just a “boy in make-up,” unlike a drag performer, who is a man parodying and performing as a if he were a woman. The fact is that more men are stepping out of what has traditionally been their comfort zone and refuse to apologize for the fashion choices they make. One of the greatest examples is NBA star Russell Westbrook, whose fashion choices are undeniably hot while he rewrites what it means to dress like a “jock.” Fashion designers such as Rick Owens and Nicopanda are challenging what is menswear — catcalls of “androgyny,” “effeminate” or “flamboyant” be damned. Much of Gucci’s latest menswear line made waves at fashion shows on both sides of the Atlantic for its patterns, cuts and fabric choices. And more celebrities, including Jaden Smith and Kanye West, have not been shy about wearing mini-skirts. Even David Beckham has been spotted in a sarong. In the end, more of us have become part of a less rigid society. We’re more individualistic and are not shy about pushing conventional boundaries. Fashion and beauty companies have no choice but to accept, and even celebrate, these trends – or else they risk becoming irrelevant.

At 13:15 IST, the barometer index, the S&P BSE Sensex was down 36.19 points or 0.13% at 27,800.32. The losses for the Nifty 50 index were higher in percentage terms than those for the Sensex. The Nifty was currently down 29 points or 0.34% at 8,586.25. Weakness in global stocks weighed on sentiment on the domestic bourses. In overseas stock markets, European stocks edged lower amid rising concerns that OPEC countries will not reach an agreement over a production cut and a raft of corporate earnings. Asian stocks witnessed mixed trend amid a slew of earnings. Data showed that profit growth in China's industrial firms slowed in September from the previous month's rapid pace as several sectors showed weak activity, suggesting the world's second-biggest economy remains underpowered despite emerging signs of stability. Profits in September rose 7.7% to 577.1 billion yuan, slowing sharply from August's 19.5% jump, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). US stocks edged lower yesterday, 26 October 2016 as health care companies fell and Apple pulled technology companies down. Closer home, the market breadth indicating the overall health of the market was weak. On BSE, 1,605 shares fell and 912 shares rose. A total of 195 shares were unchanged. The BSE Mid-Cap index was currently down 0.99%. The BSE Small-Cap index was currently down 0.68%. The decline in both these indices was higher than the Sensex's decline in percentage terms.

Minyanville Why the Turn in Consumer Staples Could be Real By Scutify Oct 26, 2016 10:47 pm PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. Consumer Staples stocks, those of companies whose products you use every day like Procter & Gamble and Clorox had a solid run higher from the 2009 low. They continued to rise almost uninterrupted until the beginning of 2015. That is when they changed character to a sideways consolidation. They dipped in August when the market swooned and then quickly recovered to the consolidation zone where they churned until February. After February though they started higher again. They reached a peak in July and then started a pullback. No mere consolidation this time. the pullback has lasted almost 4 months at this point. But the last couple of days may be showing signs that the worst is over and Consumer Staples are ready to move higher. The first thing to note is that the ETF that tracks Consumer Staples ($XLP) had found support at the 200 day SMA to start September. It gave up that support at the beginning of October and it became resistance, with additional horizontal resistance at 52.50. The pullback now found support at a 50% retracement of the last move higher. The ETF jumped up from that that Tuesday and is sitting just beneath the 200 day SMA. As it does the RSI has tuned up and is moving over the mid line. The MACD has also crossed up and is rising. There are 3 things to watch to confirm if the Consumer Staples are ready for another run to the upside. First is continuation of the RSI over 60 into the bullish zone. The second is the MACD moving up into positive territory. The third and most important is the price moving up over 54. Until then it is a good start.

Most Popular The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. Credit: Rawpixel Ltd/iStock Marketers are a hardworking bunch, averaging 45.9 hours a week on the job, compared with only 45.1 for their non-marketing counterparts. More than half -- 54% -- take less than 30 minutes a day for lunch, with 30% taking only 15 minutes or less. These data come from project management software company Workfront based on an online survey conducted this summer by Regina Corso Consulting among 606 U.S. adults ages 18 and older employed full or part time at companies with 500 or more employees. The report states that "demands on marketers have only increased in the last year. While the vast majority of marketers express an optimistic view of their work life, troubling trends in the number of hours spent at work and the prevalence of inter-team conflict have arisen." Indeed, 98% of respondents reported experiencing conflict with other teams. Not surprisingly, 29% say blocks of uninterrupted time would help them be more productive. All the more reason to just skip that lunch completely. Here's a well-earned customer reward: In just the latest evidence almost anything can happen at Walmart, shopper Cecilia Rivas made national headlines earlier this month when she gave birth in the checkout line at a Payson, Utah, store. She insisted on paying for her merchandise before the blessed event. Less widely noted, the store invited her back a little over a week later for a surprise baby shower, with gifts that included a stroller, a Graco Pack 'n Play pen, and plenty of diapers and wipes. A Walmart employee who interpreted for Ms. Rivas with Salt Lake City's Fox 13 described her as "surprised but happy." Last month MillerCoors told distributors it would launch a low-cal beer called Goldwing in an apparent attempt to take on hot-selling Michelob Ultra. But Goldwing's wings are being clipped before it even has a chance to fly onto shelves in planned test markets in Texas and Louisiana. In a note to distributors this week, MillerCoors said it was putting the test on hold. "We heard a range of feedback on Goldwing. But one point that came through loud and clear is that what we're doing with Coors Light and Miller Lite is working, so now is not the time to shift focus," stated Chief Marketing Officer David Kroll. "So while Goldwing tested very well with drinkers, we're going to hold off and redirect that planned investment behind Coors Light and Miller Lite." Beer Business Daily gave the move a positive review. "It's a Herculean effort in self-restraint, and I think it will serve them well in the long-term," stated editor Harry Schuhmacher. From beer to water: Pur has launched an online and integrated marketing campaign from Arnold Worldwide showing a "Water Bar" featuring tap water from locales nationwide served up to customers. As each is informed about the contaminants -- all at perfectly legal limits -- in the water, such as mercury, chloroform, and lead, they get turned off and leave. The message from the Helen of Troy brand is that "water that meets safe drinking standards may not meet yours." The idea is to steer people to KnowYourWater.com to find out what lurks in their local supply, and get across the point that Pur removes lead and 70 other contaminants. You want content? Here's some content. Procter & Gamble Co. Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard has declared something of a war on "crap content" in recent speeches. And that's something this "cleaning dance" video from Pittsburgh Steelers star Antonio Brown for P&G and Rite Aid -- linked to a contest giving away a free trip to Super Bowl LI to a lucky shopper -- clearly is not. The 30-second video can be found on Mr. Brown's Facebook page as well as YouTube. "Dancing while cleaning has long been a universal human behavior," said P&G Brand Manager Eric Rose in a statement. "So we thought it would be fun to reward our most creative shoppers that tackle cleaning in style." The agency behind the effort is Integer, with plans for local TV promotion. Taco Bell's 'Taco Heros' Credit: Taco Bell As Chicago Cubs fans try to forget Tuesday night's 0-6 loss to the Cleveland Indians, Taco Bell gave fans half a reason to celebrate. The Yum Brands chain will give away Doritos Locos tacos after Francisco Lindor of the Indians stole second base during in game one of the World Series. Mr. Lindor is the fifth player to steal a base during the chain's "Steal a Base, Steal a Taco" promotion, which first ran in 2007. He joins Jacoby Ellsbury, Jason Bartlett, Ángel Pagán and Lorenzo Cain in being applauded by the chain as a "Taco Hero." The free tacos, one per person, will be available at participating restaurants from 2-6 p.m. local time on Nov. 2. The offer was mentioned on air during the game on Fox and was promoted by both Taco Bell and Major League Baseball on social media. Blue Bunny is a hit with Cleveland fans. Credit: Courtesy of Blue Bunny Meanwhile, ice cream brand Blue Bunny got in on the giveaway game in its own way Tuesday. With the World Series starting in Cleveland right near the Cleveland Cavaliers making their season debut and commemorating last season's championship, there was plenty for sports fans to celebrate. LeBron James joked days earlier that having an ice cream truck outside of the two arenas would make the night even better. So Blue Bunny sent a truck of ice cream to Cleveland and handed out treats to fans in the area between Progressive Field and the Quicken Loans Arena. Olson Engage was the agency on the project.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Stocks Forex Commodities Gold & Silver Today's Pick Portfolio Tracker US stocks slip from 2-week highs Reuters   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet New York, Oct 26:   US stocks slipped from two-week highs on Tuesday as results and forecasts from companies in sectors, including housing and consumer products, failed to live up to expectations. Apple, the largest US company by market capitalisation, posted after the bell better-than-expected iPhone sales that however continued a declining trend and shares fell about 2 per cent, briefly dragging S&P 500 futures to session lows. During the regular session, Whirlpool, down 10.8 per cent to $152.09, cited soft demand as it posted lower-than-expected earnings and gave an underwhelming forecast. Sherwin Williams' outlook also disappointed Wall Street and shares fell 10.9 per cent to $247.61. Both were an indication to some analysts that the housing sector may be cooling. “Lacklustrr results from Whirlpool and Sherwin Williams may indicate a slowing in the housing cycle,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. She said those results could be weighing on Home Depot , which was down 3.5 per cent at $123.34 as the largest points decliner on the S&P 500. Lowes Cos fell 3.5 per cent to $68.47. Consumer products company Procter & Gamble rose 3.4 per cent to $86.97 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, while sportswear maker Under Armour fell 13.2 per cent to $32.89 after it reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. “We had a rally (Monday) and haven’t been able to sustain it, due to weaker-than-expected numbers from some names,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, calling the day's earnings a "mixed bag.” Overall, annualised third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 per cent, effectively putting an end to an earnings recession, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 per cent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 per cent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 per cent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 5,283.40. Futures were also pressured after the bell by a late decline in oil prices after data showed a bigger-than-expected build in US crude inventories. 3M fell 2.9 per cent to $166.23 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. Caterpillar lost 1.8 per cent after a downbeat forecast, while General Motors fell 4.2 percent amid fears regarding future profits. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.17-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and nine new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and 73 new lows. About 6.39 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges, in line with the 6.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel US stocks slipped from two-week highs on Tuesday as results and forecasts from companies in sectors including housing and consumer products failed to live up to expectations. Apple, the largest US company by market capitalization, posted after the bell better-than-expected iPhone sales that however continued a declining trend and shares fell about 2 percent, briefly dragging S&P 500 futures to session lows. During the regular session, Whirlpool , down 10.8 percent to USD 152.09, cited soft demand as it posted lower-than-expected earnings and gave an underwhelming forecast. Sherwin Williams' outlook also disappointed Wall Street and shares fell 10.9 percent to USD 247.61. Both were an indication to some analysts that the housing sector may be cooling. "Lackluster results from Whirlpool and Sherwin Williams may indicate a slowing in the housing cycle," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. She said those results could be weighing on Home Depot , which was down 3.5 percent at USD 123.34 as the largest points decliner on the S&P 500. Lowes Cos fell 3.5 percent to USD 68.47. Consumer products company Procter & Gamble rose 3.4 percent to USD 86.97 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, while sportswear maker Under Armour fell 13.2 percent to USD 32.89 after it reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. “We had a rally (Monday) and haven’t been able to sustain it, due to weaker-than-expected numbers from some names,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, calling the day’s earnings a "mixed bag." Overall, annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 percent, effectively putting an end to an earnings recession, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. Futures were also pressured after the bell by a late decline in oil prices after data showed a bigger-than-expected build in US crude inventories. 3M fell 2.9 percent to USD 166.23 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. Caterpillar lost 1.8 percent after a downbeat forecast, while General Motors fell 4.2 percent amid fears regarding future profits. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and nine new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and 73 new lows. About 6.39 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges, in line with the 6.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 27, 2016 at 7:32PM For several years running, Unilever (NYSE:UL) has conducted a global rationalization of its many brands and products under the general assumption that reducing complexity can boost profits. In this segment from Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, Motley Fool analyst Vincent Shen is joined by senior Fool.com contributor Asit Sharma to discuss what this undertaking looks like on the manufacturing side and the impact SKU reduction can have on the supply chain. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 12, 2016. Asit Sharma: One of the ways that Unilever and other companies benefit once they trim those SKUs is that their manufacturing setups become more profitable. So again, some learning today -- companies have what are called manufacturing lines. That is, when you go into a plant you can imagine that not every product has its own manufacturing line, else we would have factories taking up most of the square footage on Earth. But similar products lines and manufacturing setup is a process of preparing several products to run through lines either individually or ganged up together. So if you can take, to use an example, a package of cereal and reduce the sizes of those boxes or the numbers of sizes that you offer, that is, then you can make that one manufacturing setup, which is there to produce those boxes, more profitable. And those of you who are familiar with manufacturing will understand that the company itself may have part of the manufacturing process, but every multinational conglomerate has to work with a series of smaller suppliers and they have their own manufacturing setups to produce one product. So you can see this trimming of SKUs reducing the complexity of the operation, and this is a big thing that industry people talk about. It's not just shrinking or reduction, it's the reduction of complexity, and Unilever is really bent on doing that. Vincent Shen: Yeah, I think ... let me just jump in there really quick. The thing that really surprised me is when they talk about this project, the fact that the amount of work that they had to do with their partners. It wasn't just this internal process that the right managers in departments could implement unilaterally. They had to work with their marketing teams that had previously invested resources and time into certain projects, excuse me, and products and SKUs. And then also their retailers, for example, you know the companies that they distribute their products to are concerned about making sure their shelf space is the way they want it to be. And that the products that Unilever is providing them -- you know a huge supplier, I'm sure, for a lot of these retailers -- that basically they can still optimize their shelf space, what they keep in stock, in their stores based on these changes. And some of them very radical that Unilever was making. Sharma: That's an excellent point. We're going to talk about our second company, Procter & Gamble, in a moment, but P&G's CEO recently made that point on an analyst call, and he said that when they talk with their retail partners, that's one of the major things that CEOs of their retail partners are telling them is, "Hey, reduce this complexity." And you know, we're in a political season. Elections are coming up next month, and one of the things we can extrapolate from what you just said, Vince, is that this can be a really political process. You can imagine if a marketing team has worked two years on an innovation and another management part of the company looks at this product that marketing team has pushed forth and realizes that logistically it's very hard to produce, and you have teams tussling over whether a product stays or goes. And the companies which are successful at SKU rationalization understand that they, at the end of the line, are responsible to shareholders, to earnings per share. So they have to make some tough decisions, and this often means reducing suppliers. I'm going to give you another eye-opening statistic. We talked about Unilever reducing SKU count by as much as 20% as a multiyear goal. The company also wants to reduce the number of its suppliers by 35%. And these two goals are related; it may be a little scary to have a revenue concentration with a huge corporation like Unilever or a smaller sub-manufacturer and understand they are looking, not just to trim the SKUs, but to trim the number of people they work with. But again, this serves shareholders' interests, it reduces complexity, and reducing complexity reduces costs, which boosts net income at the end of the day.

Rudd: Stocks the best investment to increase wealth Lauren Rudd, For USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin 9:37 a.m. CDT October 27, 2016 Lauren Rudd (Photo: Submitted ) 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE “When this old world starts a getting me down...,” (James Taylor, 1998) While a variety of scary ghosts and goblins will soon be knocking on your door asking for treats, none will appear to be scarier than Wall Street. Or to view James Taylor’s words from an investment perspective, the Street’s merciless volatility is getting you down. As both an economist and Wall Street analyst, I am increasingly concerned over the continued decimation of investor confidence brought about by an unadulterated fear of the markets. Do not despair, I have an answer you might find extremely useful in today’s capricious investment climate. However, let me preface what follows with the mantra that stocks are and always have been the best investment for increasing your wealth. The key questions of course are what to buy and when. The last point is easy, anytime. Therefore, the only remaining issue is which companies do you invest in? Here is a short-cut. I am reminded to bring it up every year because it is part of my teaching curriculum. Suppose for a moment you had a list of about 284 solid, high quality, dividend paying companies that have withstood the test of time, would that help? Such help is available by means of the Mergent Handbook of Dividend Achievers and it remains, in my opinion, the single most useful tool for individual investors. I was once asked the question that if you took away my computer systems, access to the Internet, my telephone and only allowed me the use of one item with which to select investment candidates, what would it be? This book would be my answer. In fact, at one time I was quoted on the back cover making just that statement. No, I do not have, and never have had, any financial ties to Mergent, although as a matter of complete disclosure they do offer my students a student discount. The book profiles those companies that have increased their regular annual cash dividend for a minimum of 10 consecutive years. Less than 10 percent of all listed dividend paying companies make the Dividend Achievers list. If a company misses a year, it is off the list and must again increase dividends for 10 consecutive years to be added back on. Mergent is not content to simply list the stellar dividend performers. Rather it takes the list and proceeds to slice and dice it in a variety of ways. For example, it ranks the entire list by total return based on 1, 3 and 5 year increments. It lists the top 20 companies in 12 different categories such as total assets, return on assets, return on equity and dividend yield. Yet, the various lists comprise only about 50 pages of the book. The remaining pages are devoted to a detailed description of each company, including 6 years of annual financial data along with the two most recent quarters and a chart of stock prices covering a 10-year period. I have been using and writing about the Handbook for over 24 years and I believe it to be one of the few remaining bargains in the arena of independent investment research. Moreover, you do not need any form of assistance to benefit from what Mergent has put together. Some of the companies discussed in this column were initially brought to my attention via the Handbook. If you are interested in knowing which company has the longest record for increasing its dividend every year, it is a two-way tie. American States Water and Procter & Gamble have been increasing their dividends for 62 consecutive years. And you say you cannot figure out what to invest in. What do I not like about the book? First, Mergent has become quite commercial with what used to be a relatively inexpensive investment tool. While not prohibitive, the price is also not what I would call inexpensive. The other point is relatively minor but annoying. The print is rather small. This is a result of having to incorporate as much data as possible in a relative small space. Personally, being a bit long in tooth I keep a magnifying glass nearby, just in case. If you would like to obtain a single copy or a subscription, contact Mergent at 1-800-342-5647. Mention I sent you to them and maybe they will offer you a discount. Lauren Rudd is a financial writer and columnist. You can write to him at LVERudd@aol.com.

The incumbent Republicans said they have kept spending down and are proud of the county's AAA-bond rating.  All four candidates running for a seat on the county freeholder board had a chance to tout their accomplishments and lay out their views at a debate Wednesday night sponsored by the Monmouth County League of Women's Voters.  No matter what the topic discussed, the two Democratic candidates, Matthew Doherty and Sue Fulton, seemed to find a way to bring the discussion back to taxes.  "Taxes in Monmouth County are out of control, we all know that," Doherty said. "It's time to put a lid on it."   Doherty, who is the mayor in Belmar, said taxes in the borough haven't gone up in six years.  DiMaso instead pointed to the county budget and explained how it's dropped from $491 million in 2011 to $469 million this year — a $22 million savings, she said. "We did cut taxes $4.5 million last year," she said. "The year before we raised them somewhat because we have a AAA-bond rating — one of 33 in the country and the only one in New Jersey. We have that bond rating because of the way we handle our finances."  More importantly, Freeholder Director Tom Arnone said, is capital expenditures in the country are down more than $50 million. He also noted the shared services agreement between 52 towns in the county "It's something that we're very proud of," he said. "It's very unique. It's very much looked at across the state."  Democratic candidate Sue Fulton said her experience as a businesswoman will help her take a "sharper pencil" to eliminate duplication and areas of waste in the county budget.  "Our opponents are proud of keeping the budget level, but it needs to be cut," Fulton said.  Doherty, 43, and Fulton, 57, of Asbury Park, are vying to become the first Democrats elected to the Republican-controlled Board of Chosen Freeholders since Amy Mallet of Fair Haven was elected in 2008. That was the same year Democrats took control of the board for the first time in 23 years. Doherty is currently serving his second term as mayor of Belmar. Before that, he served on the borough's council for two terms. Fulton was part of the first U.S. Military Academy at West Point class to admit women before she became a captain. After the military, she went on to have a 25-year career in the private sector, serving as a manager with companies like Procter & Gamble and Merck.  If elected, Republicans would still hold control of the freeholder board.  Arnone and DiMaso, the deputy director, are hoping to get elected for a third and second term, respectively.  Prior to the freeholder debate, Monmouth County Sheriff Shaun Golden, the incumbent, sparred against Democrat Jeff Cantor, a Marlboro councilman and U.S. Army colonel. Both candidates agreed that the two most important issues facing the county are fighting the heroin and opioid problem and keeping the residents safe from terrorism.  Golden said his office has taken a "multi-prong approach" to fighting the heroin epidemic, which includes educating residents and beefing up enforcement. The sheriff said the county has done more to teach students and residents about prescription drugs, including implementing a prescription drug drop off box. The department has also added six K-9 dogs in his time as sheriff, Golden said.  Cantor said he is looking to put together a task force that includes physicians, pharmacists, addicts, treatment specialist, clinical outreach coordinators and law enforcement officers.  "I will not take my eye off the ball when it comes to addressing the heroin crisis," he said.  Alex Napoliello may be reached at anapoliello@njadvancemedia.com.

But the omnipresent social network is resonating with some serious brands, such as car manufacturers, credit card firms and the usual marketing giants in the shape of P&G and Unilever, although unsurprisingly, apart from high PPC spender Booking.com, there are no other travel brands in either of their respective top ten advertising clients (unless you count Walt Disney). Facebook clearly has a long way to go before it makes a significant challenge to the dominant position of its rival down the road in Silicon Valley, but this infographic from e-Intelligence has some great data to illustrate where the pair currently reside in the online advertising ecosystem:   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Kevin May Kevin is senior editor and a co-founder at Tnooz. He was previously editor of UK-based magazine Travolution and web editor of Media Week UK from 2003 to 2005. He has worked in regional newspapers (Essex Enquirer) and started his career at the Police Gazette at New Scotland Yard in London. He has a degree in criminology, a postgraduate diploma in magazine journalism and publishes his first book - a biography about Depeche Mode - in late-2016.   Tags booking.com facebook Google PPC search engine optimisation SEO Comments Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

As far as ROI is concerned, I personally believe Google is much better then Facebook but Kevin, the reason advertisers still spend on Google and Facebook even with low ROI is they look for long term revenues. Its not one time conversion, once a customer forever a customer thats the way these businesses spend money on advertising Reply 4 years ago   John Pope Very nice InfoGraphic, e-Intelligence & Tnooz. 🙂 Duly (Ever)noted. Key take-away: $1 spent on Google Adwords = $2 Average Revenue for Advertisers $1 spent on Facebook Ads = $3 Average Revenue for Advertisers Therefore, advertising through each channel, on average across all industry segments, delivers a 50% Cost of Sale (CPA) on Google and 33% Cost of Sale (CPA) on Facebook. If that’s actually the case, why does any business utilise either channel, considering the terribly poor ROI? Or have both companies just been that effective in “pulling the wool” over the collective global advertiser’s eyes? Something smells rotten in Denmark – thoughts, anybody? Reply 4 years ago   John Pope @Kevin, It would be great if you could get any of your Google or Facebook contacts to comment on the ROI metric highlighted above. 🙂 A return on ad spend can’t possibly be that bad… or can it? I understand that it’s in both companies’ interests to not be very efficient or effective when delivering audiences to advertisers, but these results are surely too BAD to be true. Are they not? It’s amazing that an advertising platform – Google – that fails approximately 98% of the time is considered THE industry benchmark in our rapidly growing and “efficient” digital economy. Considering their failure rate, is there any wonder how they generated more than $43B in ad revenue last year? I reckon it has to be considered the greatest “confidence game” ever conceived of, and executed, in commercial history – certainly, the most scalable. 😉 Reply 4 years ago   Bridget Holland What’s an average Cost of Sale percentage on advertising overall? I know so many companies who have spent money on newspaper, magazine, radio, TV and not see a good return. I’m not convinced Google and FB are any worse than the rest! How many businesses never got a cent from the Yellow Pages, even before the internet? Also I wouldn’t get too worked up about averages. There are many badly targeted, badly set up campaigns which are never going to make a cent (eg in a recent instance, Google set up a campaign for a local business and didn’t get the location targeting pinned down / use out-of-location negative keywords). Then there are really tightly targeted and managed campaigns (eg careful keyword selection and dynamic landing pages to convert) which will deliver much lower cost of sale percentages. Blame as much with the advertisers as with the advertising channels.

This year, CGT’s annual Tech Trends Report, produced with Gartner, reveals a slight increase to 2.1 percent, up from 1.8 percent in 2014. It may not seem like much of an increase, but new challenges have led to exciting advances in technology for companies to explore. Digital consumers are the primary change agent, compounded by economic changes and shifting demographics.    This webinar will focus on the significant forces driving change and the initiatives that consumer goods imperatives are now exploring to stay competitive.   This interactive discussion will be led by Ed Porter, Consumer Products Research Analyst at Gartner, who will be joined by Andy Walter, Retired VP of IT & Shares Services at Procter & Gamble and Jeff McDaniel of RSi. Ed will review the results of this year’s research and have an open discussion with the panelists.   Moderator: Kara Romanow, Executive Editor, CGT   Speakers: Ed Porter, Consumer Products Research Director, Gartner Andy Walter, VP of IT & Shares Services, Retired, Procter & Gamble Jeff McDaniel, VP Customer Success, Retail Solutions Inc.

Tongal will be responsible for digital content strategy as well as content creation, including “the development and production of an amplified slate of content based on Mattel’s library of iconic brands.” “Mattel Creations is dedicated to discovering new ways to share creative, captivating stories across all platforms. Our partnership with Tongal and its robust network of creators will enable us to build out an innovative, scalable offering of content for all channels and markets around the world,” Mattel chief content officer Catherine Balsam-Schwaber said in a statement. “Tongal is re-defining the content model and we look forward to working closely with their team to further our brand strategies and build our storytelling platform.” Under the agreement, Tongal will utilize its creative network to create content across broadcast, digital and social media channels, enhancing Mattel Creation’s content capabilities and digital offerings. The agreement does not impact Mattel’s relationship with primary creative agency BBDO or affect BBDO’s responsibilities for the brand. In fact, sources tell us Mattel has actually expanded its relationship with the agency. That said, Tongal head of strategy and client development Vaughan Emsley, who joined Tongal in the newly-created position this August after serving as both global CEO on the P&G business and strategic advisor to global chairman Kevin Roberts with Saatchi & Saatchi recently told Adweek, “Any company with an open source approach like ours is seen by agencies as a competitor.” BBDO, of course, recently launched its own crowdsourced content offering via AMV BBDO’s Flare Studio. “Mattel has long been a champion for innovation in storytelling, including being one of the earliest adopters of Tongal over six years ago,” said Tongal CEO Rob Salvatore. “This multi-year deal is an exciting next step in our partnership and reinforces their commitment to creativity. We’re honored to be helping them develop new ways to connect with audiences around the world.” The first work to emerge from the partnership will be a behind-the-scenes feature designed to complement the Amazon Original special An American Girl Story—Melody 1963: Love Has to Win and will premiere some time next month. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Raise the Hammer About Principles Authors Comments Submissions Register Forget Password? Special Report: Light Rail Our Right to a Healthy Environment Includes Light Rail We have the right to breathe clean air, and City Council has sworn to protect this right. By Chris Parkinson Published October 26, 2016 The following is the text of my delegation to the October 25, 2016 General Issues Committee meeting on Hamilton's Light Rail Transit (LRT) project. On February 18, 2015, every single member of our current council, except one, in a standing vote, unanimously passed a motion declaring every Hamiltonian's Right to a Healthy Environment. A proud moment for our city, we were the first in the province to make this declaration. This was your promise to us, and future generations that we had turned a page. No longer would the moniker 'Gritty City' apply. We had the right to breathe clean air, and you had sworn to protect this right. Yet in a Spectator article from four days ago, we found out that downtown Hamilton has the worst air pollution in Ontario. The worst. In the substance of the declaration of our Right to a Healthy Environment, you pledged to support infrastructure projects that protect the environment, including air quality. You vowed to prioritize efficient public transit, cycling, and walking. And you have done that. You've substantially increased the number of bike lanes, you've invested in more walkable streets like Concession, brought in traffic calming measures, and for the past decade you've been planning and approving the development of the BLAST network. Very forward thinking councilors. We commend you and thank you. You responsibly fought to have this first stage of this LRT system paid for in full by the province, protecting against raising our property taxes. Waterloo had to subsidize their LRT with $285 million by raising their taxes 1.2 percent. They understood it was a good investment and were willing to pay. You understood LRT is a good investment, and you even had it paid for. We congratulate you. Eventually, the city's population will move quickly and cleanly through your planned BLAST grid of inter-connected LRTs, fed from outer areas by electric buses. This is visionary and the way we must proceed for our future growth, the quality of our air, and the health of our children. Hamilton was once called the 'Electric City'. Nicola Telsa brought AC current in to our city, the first in Canada, sparking the growth of industry and attracting companies such as Westinghouse, Proctor and Gamble, and International Harvester. We now need to attract the industry, innovation, and entrepreneurs that will fuel the greatest economic opportunity in the history of the human race - the conversion of fossil fuels to renewable electric. Electric. Hamilton was ahead of its time. And now we're getting back on track. Your progressive BLAST network vision sends a signal to the businesses and industry that we want to attract, that Hamilton understands the future. That the future is electric. That efficient, clean mass transportation is important to moving the people our growth will bring. There is a reason every major city in the world has some form of LRT along its main corridors. You've understood this, planned for this, and have taken very responsible steps to have this first leg of our LRT plan realized. We at Hamilton Blue Dot commend you. We thank you for honouring your commitment to protecting our Right to a Healthy Environment. Please keep up this good work. Hamilton's future is indeed, Electric. 0 Comments View Comments: Nested | Flat Post a Comment You must be logged in to comment.

The Gamble Building on Victoria Square will mark the milestone anniversary with a tea party, a talk and presentation, visits from school pupils and displays on Thursday November 3. A reading room in the Gamble Building in about 1900 The building was opened in November 1896 and still contains the town’s Central Library and local history archives. The landmark was the idea of the town’s first mayor, chemical magnate Sir David Gamble, who donated £30,000, a sum worth £3.57m today, to make the project a reality. Huge crowds lined the streets to see the Earl of Derby visit St Helens and to witness Sir David handing the finished building over to the borough. The 120th anniversary will be celebrated with a timeline wall display of features and people associated with the building and a case showing off to visitors the golden casket and freedom of the borough awarded to Sir David for his gift of the Gamble Institute. School pupils will browse original photographs, news cuttings and plans of the building and the local history room will have a talk by Pauline HUrst about the Gamble family, including their famous relatives in America involved with giant firm Proctor and Gamble. There will also be a tea party running throughout the day from 10am until 4pm. The building was originally created as a technical school to provide the advanced qualifications people working in local industries needed. It opened two years after plans were drawn up in 1894, with a library complete with ladies-only reading room on the ground floor, a basement devoted to manual training which included a complete metallurgical laboratory, and a first floor housing classrooms, lecture rooms and departments for cookery and laundry. Art and chemical departments were included on the second floor. The building remains a hub of learning and creativity today although some of its original Victorian rules, such as children under 12 being banned from entering the library or borrowing books there, are now long gone. The institute also honours Sir David with a prominent marble bust of him visible in the main library.

The emirate is not simply adopting the latest advancements; it is actively creating them. Maha Al Mezaina, Project Manager, Dubai Future Foundation: · The program aims to tap into any and all sectors that affect people's lives now - as well as any novel sectors that may affect them in the future - and play an active role in identifying the challenges and opportunities that may arise. 26 October 2016 Dubai – The Dubai Future Accelerators program carries on with its first round, having succeeded in attracting 2,274 applications from 73 countries in less than a month – out of which, the 30 most innovative entries were shortlisted. The number of applications that the Dubai Future Accelerators program has attracted in record time makes it one of the fastest-growing business acceleration programs in the world. This cements Dubai’s global status and role as a major player in the development of next-generation technologies and business models. Paul Smith, Head of Program at Dubai Future Accelerators, said: “The global reach that the Dubai Future Accelerators program has achieved serves not only to place Dubai firmly on the global innovation and technology map, bringing the world’s top innovators to the emirate, but also enables Dubai to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of strategic economic sectors all over the world. The emirate is not simply adopting the latest advancements; it is actively creating them.” One example of the successful entries is Comae Technology, a UAE-based Cyber Security start up specialized on memory forensics for both digital forensics and incident response to cyber incidents purposes. According to US tech giant and cybersecurity specialists Symantec, the number of zero-day vulnerabilities (a hole in software that is unknown to the vendor) discovered in 2015 more than doubled to 54 – a 125 percent increase from 2014. This makes start-ups such as Comae not only relevant but necessary for cities and governments in the 21st century. Advertisement Meanwhile, Mistbox, another finalist, presents a connected device that promises to render AC units up to 30 percent more efficient, all the while tracking savings through a mobile app. Relying on evaporative cooling, Mistbox offers a new way to not only save money, but also substantially reduce carbon emissions – the company claims, in fact, that, if implemented on a global scale, the net effect would be equivalent to taking 1.4 billion cars off the road. Carrying on with the spirit of reinventing economic sectors, Loyyal aims to reinvent how loyalty is created and rewarded. Using blockchain and smart contract technology, Loyyal has built an interoperable loyalty and rewards platform to address a highly fragmented industry. It offers multiple industries an innovative way to incentivize customer behavior. With a more regionally focused approach, finalist Pixelbug is working through DFA to create a more engaging way for children to learn Arabic. The Dubai-based award-winning augmented and virtual reality company was recently named one of the UAE's most promising start-ups by Forbes Middle East. Its products are used by leading multinationals such as P&G, Nestlé, Lego, and Sony. Another notable entry in round one of the program is Vinaya, which specializes in designing wearable devices – among other technologies – that aim to improve people’s mindfulness in a fast-paced modern lifestyle. Their products include ALTRUIS, a range of designer Bluetooth-enabled rings, bracelets, and necklaces, that use cutting-edge technology to enhance mindfulness and digital balance; and Zenta, which is the first biometric smart band that uses sensory technology and learning algorithms to collect data, build a profile of the wearer, and give personalized insights in 5 key areas: Physical Activity, Sleep, Positive Habits, Happiness, and Stress. Mindfulness is fast becoming an area of interest in many economic sectors: a 2010 study published in Consciousness and Cognition Journal, showed that brief mindfulness training significantly improved visuo-spatial processing, working memory, and executive functioning. Maha Al Mezaina, Project Manager at Dubai Future Foundation, said: “As evidenced by the projects presented by the finalists in Dubai Future Accelerators, the program aims to tap into any and all sectors that affect people’s lives now – as well as any novel sectors that may affect them in the future – and play an active role in facing the challenges that may arise and flag the opportunities ripe to capitalize on.” The full list of finalists chosen to take part in the first round of the program includes a selection of the most innovative companies in the world that are currently developing and testing creative ideas and advanced technologies with a future outlook, which offer solutions to the challenges facing key sectors including health, education, energy and water, transport, infrastructure, security and safety, and technology. For 12 weeks, these 30 companies will work with the eight government authorities participating in Dubai Future Accelerators to develop and test products and solutions for the challenges that face key economic and strategic sectors in the cities of the 21st century in the UAE, and that can also be applied to countries in the region and around the world. -Ends- For media inquiries, contact: Nedal Al Asaad Nedal.AlAsaad@bm.com Emad Dwekat Emad.dwekat@bm.com ASDA’A Burson-Marsteller 044507600 © Press Release 2016 © Copyright Zawya.

ALSO READ US stocks end in the red US stocks end in the red US stocks end in the red US stocks end in the red US stocks end in the red Lackluster spate of earnings and weak economic data affect momentum U.S. stocks finished lower on Tuesday, 25 October 2016 giving back some of the previous day's advance as worries about a lackluster spate of earnings and a slip in a reading of consumer confidence weighed on market sentiment. A drop in the price of oil below $50 a barrel, lingering uncertainty about the U.S. presidential election and growing expectations of a rate increase by the Federal Reserve, also contributed to the downbeat mood. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 53.76 points, or 0.3%, at 18,169.27, as shares of Home Depot weighed on blue-chips with a 3.2% decline. Earlier, the average had been down as many as 71 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index gave up 26.45 points, or 0.5%, to wrap at 5,283.40. The S&P 500 declined by 8.17 points, or 0.4%, to 2,143.16. Nine of the 11 main sectors ended in the red. The consumer-discretionary closed off 1.2%, while materials lost 1%. Shares of Dow component 3M fell 2.9% after reporting earnings that beat Wall Street expectations, but the company posted sales that were flat relative to the prior year and reduced the top end of its yearly earnings forecast. Market participants have been wrestling with third-quarter earnings that have outperformed lowered expectations, but a number of companies have cut their annual outlooks, which has raised questions about future earnings. Investors were eager to find out the results from two of the tech giants this week, with Apple reporting after the closing bell on Tuesday. Traders continued to eye economic data for hints on the prospects for a Federal Reserve interest-rate increase before the end of the year. Higher rates tend to send investors away from precious metals into investments that carry a yield. A reading on consumer confidence Tuesday showed a decline to 98.6 in October, a three-month low, from 103.5 in September. The FHFA Housing Price Index for August rose 0.7%, which followed an increase of 0.5% in July. Separately, the Case-Shiller 20-city Home Price Index for August rose 5.1%, which fell in-line with the consensus. This followed the previous month's unrevised reading of 5.0%. Shares in Whirlpool dropped 11% after the appliance maker reported third-quarter profit and sales that missed expectations, and issued a downbeat outlook. Merck & Co. rose 2% after the drugmaker's third-quarter earnings and sales came in above expectations. Chemicals maker DuPont& Co. shares fell 0.7% despite the company raising its yearly profit forecast and better-than-expected quarterly earnings. The company is working on its merger with Dow Chemical. Procter & Gamble gained 3.4% after the consumer goods company reported earnings ahead of forecasts. Lockheed Martin shares jumped 7.4% after the aerospace company posted higher-than-expected revenue and hiked its dividend. Baker Hughes shares rallied 4.3% after the oil-field services company reported a narrower-than-expected loss. General Motors shares ended down 4.2% even as auto giant's quarterly profit doubled. GM also posted higher revenue on strong U.S. truck sales. But it signaled continued weakness in Europe because of the fallout from the U.K.'s pending exit from the European Union, or Brexit. Crude futures fell on Tuesday, 25 October 2016 with prices in New York settling below $50 a barrel for the first time in just over a week, pressured by the possibility that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' plan to curb output will fail after Iraq signaled unwillingness to take part in the proposed deal. December West Texas Intermediate crude fell by 56 cents, or 1.1%, to settle at $49.96 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That was the lowest settlement and first finish below $50 since 17 October 2016. OPEC members in late September reached a preliminary agreement to limit the group's daily production to between 32.5 million to 33 million barrels a day. Bullion prices ended higher at Comex on Tuesday, 25 october 2016. Gold futures settled Tuesday at their highest level in about three weeks, rebounding from the previous day's decline as uncertainty ahead of the U.S. presidential election, some weakness in the U.S. dollar and a fall in domestic equities boosted the metal's appeal. December gold rose $9.90, or 0.8%, to settle at $1,273.60 an ounce. Prices settled at their highest level since 3 October 2016. Prices are still down about 3.1% so far this month. December silver gained 17.6 cents, or 1%, to $17.78 an ounce. Treasuries finished on a mixed note with the short end of the curve underperforming. The yield on the 2-yr note rose two basis points to 0.86% while the yield on the benchmark 10-yr note ended down one basis point at 1.76%. Today's trading volume was below the average of 853 million as 819 million shares changed hands at the NYSE floor. Tomorrow's economic data will include the weekly MBA Mortgage Index and International Trade in Goods for September, which will be released at 7:00 ET and 8:30 ET, respectively. The day's data will be capped off with the 10:00 ET release of New Home Sales for September (consensus 610k).

Earlier, the average had been down as many as 71 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index gave up 26.45 points, or 0.5%, to wrap at 5,283.40. The S&P 500 declined by 8.17 points, or 0.4%, to 2,143.16. Nine of the 11 main sectors ended in the red. The consumer-discretionary closed off 1.2%, while materials lost 1%. Shares of Dow component 3M fell 2.9% after reporting earnings that beat Wall Street expectations, but the company posted sales that were flat relative to the prior year and reduced the top end of its yearly earnings forecast. Market participants have been wrestling with third-quarter earnings that have outperformed lowered expectations, but a number of companies have cut their annual outlooks, which has raised questions about future earnings. Investors were eager to find out the results from two of the tech giants this week, with Apple reporting after the closing bell on Tuesday. Traders continued to eye economic data for hints on the prospects for a Federal Reserve interest-rate increase before the end of the year. Higher rates tend to send investors away from precious metals into investments that carry a yield. A reading on consumer confidence Tuesday showed a decline to 98.6 in October, a three-month low, from 103.5 in September. The FHFA Housing Price Index for August rose 0.7%, which followed an increase of 0.5% in July. Separately, the Case-Shiller 20-city Home Price Index for August rose 5.1%, which fell in-line with the consensus. This followed the previous month's unrevised reading of 5.0%. Shares in Whirlpool dropped 11% after the appliance maker reported third-quarter profit and sales that missed expectations, and issued a downbeat outlook. Merck & Co. rose 2% after the drugmaker's third-quarter earnings and sales came in above expectations. Chemicals maker DuPont& Co. shares fell 0.7% despite the company raising its yearly profit forecast and better-than-expected quarterly earnings. The company is working on its merger with Dow Chemical. Procter & Gamble gained 3.4% after the consumer goods company reported earnings ahead of forecasts. Lockheed Martin shares jumped 7.4% after the aerospace company posted higher-than-expected revenue and hiked its dividend. Baker Hughes shares rallied 4.3% after the oil-field services company reported a narrower-than-expected loss. General Motors shares ended down 4.2% even as auto giant's quarterly profit doubled. GM also posted higher revenue on strong U.S. truck sales. But it signaled continued weakness in Europe because of the fallout from the U.K.'s pending exit from the European Union, or Brexit. Crude futures fell on Tuesday, 25 October 2016 with prices in New York settling below $50 a barrel for the first time in just over a week, pressured by the possibility that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' plan to curb output will fail after Iraq signaled unwillingness to take part in the proposed deal. December West Texas Intermediate crude fell by 56 cents, or 1.1%, to settle at $49.96 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That was the lowest settlement and first finish below $50 since 17 October 2016. OPEC members in late September reached a preliminary agreement to limit the group's daily production to between 32.5 million to 33 million barrels a day. Bullion prices ended higher at Comex on Tuesday, 25 october 2016. Gold futures settled Tuesday at their highest level in about three weeks, rebounding from the previous day's decline as uncertainty ahead of the U.S. presidential election, some weakness in the U.S. dollar and a fall in domestic equities boosted the metal's appeal. December gold rose $9.90, or 0.8%, to settle at $1,273.60 an ounce. Prices settled at their highest level since 3 October 2016. Prices are still down about 3.1% so far this month. December silver gained 17.6 cents, or 1%, to $17.78 an ounce. Treasuries finished on a mixed note with the short end of the curve underperforming. The yield on the 2-yr note rose two basis points to 0.86% while the yield on the benchmark 10-yr note ended down one basis point at 1.76%. Today's trading volume was below the average of 853 million as 819 million shares changed hands at the NYSE floor. Tomorrow's economic data will include the weekly MBA Mortgage Index and International Trade in Goods for September, which will be released at 7:00 ET and 8:30 ET, respectively. The day's data will be capped off with the 10:00 ET release of New Home Sales for September (consensus 610k).

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ By Siddharth Philip, P R Sanjai and George Smith Alexander | Bloomberg The agenda for Monday’s extraordinary board meeting at India’s largest conglomerate contained little hint of what was to come. Tata Sons directors were summoned to the group’s fabled Bombay House headquarters to discuss the sale of assets, its moribund UK steel business and the group’s legal wrangles with Japan’s NTT Docomo Inc., according to a person with knowledge of the events. But once the meeting started in the wood-paneled boardroom on the fourth floor, it took a different turn. Under a portrait of the formidable J R D Tata, the board wrested back chairmanship of the steel-to-software business empire for 78-year-old Ratan Tata, ousting his protege Cyrus Mistry, 48, in a coup that stunned India’s business community. Mistry said he was shocked at the nature of his dismissal, according to a letter he sent to the board, reported on by the Economic Times. The letter described the board meeting as illegal and invalid, the paper said. Yet Ratan Tata had met Mistry earlier on Monday to present him with options, according to three people with knowledge of the event. Moreover, the rift had been brewing for months, said people who work with senior Tata executives and asked not to be named because the matter is private. It was a clash of styles, a feeling that Mistry, handpicked by Tata, wasn’t adhering to the traditional values of a company that had previously been led by a person related to the Tata family. Key to the showdown was a $1.17 billion legal battle with former partner Docomo over an Indian telecom venture. Docomo is trying to enforce a London Court of International Arbitration decision ordering Tata Sons to pay the sum for failing to uphold a contract. That venture was created during Ratan Tata’s 21-year period at the helm, and Mistry’s handling of the matter was seen by some as an erosion of the Tata Sons ethic of honoring commitments, according to the people. “The biggest challenge for an organization is planning for succession, especially following the tenure of a very successful CEO,” said Vijay Govindarajan, a professor at Dartmouth University’s Tuck School of Business. “The current leadership crisis is an unwanted distraction.” Mistry’s handling of troubles at other group businesses were also causing concern, according to the people, including the break-up of Tata Steel’s European empire, which Ratan Tata helped acquire. Spokesmen for Ratan Tata and Mistry declined to comment. Yet if Mistry’s way of doing things was rankling the old guard, he also had successes in an increasingly difficult business climate. Ratan Tata had swelled group revenues more than 60-fold to $100 billion with a campaign of expansion abroad that included the troubled European steelmaker Corus Group Plc and marquee brands such as Land Rover, Jaguar, Tetley tea and New York’s Pierre hotel. With the slowdown in China dragging on global trade and Brexit concerns further damping European operations, Mistry was trying to unwind some of that growth and pay back part of the debt Tata had built up to pay for the acquisitions. And while the steel and power businesses were losing money, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., the group’s largest unit, has pushed into cloud computing and digital services to weather lackluster global IT spending, beating analysts’ estimates in the process. "I am stunned,” said S. Manikutty, a former professor at the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, who closely tracks Indian conglomerates and family businesses. “It was completely unexpected because Mr. Mistry was trying to remove important cobwebs from the Tata stable.” That didn’t save him. The day after his ouster, the corridors of Bombay House, Tata Group’s austere headquarters for 92 years in downtown Mumbai, were quiet, with most staff still in shock at the news. Traffic jammed the street outside, while reporters, TV crews and onlookers thronged the building. Media Speculation As rumors flew and media speculation mounted, Ratan Tata called together the chief executives of the group’s businesses to calm the ship. There would be continuity in all branches of the business without any issues, he told them in a 25-minute gathering, according to an executive who was present. Tata said he was keen to honor decisions made by Mistry, the person said. To read a Gadfly column on the Tata ouster, click here Ratan Tata is the latest in a long line of so-called boomerang CEOs who retook control after stepping down or being ousted. The late Steve Jobs revived Apple Inc. after more than a decade in the wilderness, A. G. Lafley made a two-year return performance at Procter & Gamble Co., Howard Schultz came back to give Starbucks Corp. another shot, and Narayana Murthy made a brief return as executive chairman at Tata’s IT rival Infosys Ltd. Now Ratan Tata’s search for a successor is back where it started. After grooming Mistry for a year before he took over, Tata and four other prominent leaders -- Venu Srinivasan, Amit Chandra, Ronen Sen and Kumar Bhattacharyya -- are part of the panel formed to find a new chairman within four months. For a story on Ratan Tata’s investment after stepping down in 2012, click here “This will mean another period of uncertainty to Tata stakeholders,” said Morgen Witzel, author of “Tata: The Evolution of a Corporate Brand.” He called the pledge to find a new leader within four months, “a heroic undertaking, given how long it took them to choose Mr. Mistry in the first place.” Tata himself has said that it’s not easy to spot a true leader. At a meeting with young entrepreneurs in Singapore in late March, he was asked about the qualities that make a chief. He responded that it wasn’t easy to tell how someone would respond until they were in the job. “The final test is crisis that one faces,” he answered at the time, speaking generally. “Someone who deals with that crisis with his sleeves rolled up, as against those who hold on, is finally the mark of a real leader.” Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

The Kuala Lumpur Composite Index remains just above the 1,675-point plateau, and the market is looking at another soft start on Wednesday. The global forecast for the Asian markets suggests mild consolidation thanks to weak earnings news and economic data, plus a decline in the price of crude oil. The European and U.S. markets were down and the Asian bourses figure to follow suit. The KLCI finished barely lower on Tuesday as losses from the plantation stocks and industrial issues were mitigated by support from the financial shares. For the day, the index eased 0.33 points or 0.02 percent to finish at 1,677.43 after trading between 1,673.18 and 1,677.44. Volume was 1.43 billion shares worth 1.8 billion ringgit. There were 421 decliners and 334 gainers, with 408 stocks finishing unchanged. Among the actives, MISC, Public Bank, Maxis and BAT all finished lower, while IHH Healthcare was unchanged and Sime Darby, Tenaga Nasional, Hong Leong Bank and Maybank all ended higher. The lead from Wall Street is soft as stocks moved lower on Tuesday, although the downside was fairly limited. The S&P 500 fell 8.17 points or 0.38 percent to 2,143.15, while the NASDAQ slid 26.43 points or 0.50 percent to 5,283.40 and the Dow lost 53.76 points or 0.30 percent to 18,169.27. The weakness came as traders reacted to the latest earnings news, with Sonic (SONC) reporting better than expected fiscal Q4 earnings but providing disappointing guidance. Also, Under Amour (UA) said its growth rate was slowing, while Procter & Gamble (PG) reported results that beat estimates. In economic news, the Conference Board noted a bigger than expected drop in consumer confidence in October. Falling crude oil prices also weighed as Dec.

The Jakarta Composite Index now rests just beneath the 5,400-point plateau, and the market may extend its losses on Wednesday. The global forecast for the Asian markets suggests mild consolidation thanks to weak earnings news and economic data, plus a decline in the price of crude oil. The European and U.S. markets were down and the Asian bourses figure to follow suit. The JCI finished modestly lower on Tuesday following weakness from the telecoms and mixed performances from the financial shares and resource stocks. For the day, the index sank 23.18 points or 0.43 percent to finish at the daily low of 5,397.82 after peaking at 5,436.21. There were 161 decliners and 154 gainers, with 98 stocks finishing unchanged.

The KOSPI settled just above the 2,035-point plateau, and the market may take further damage on Wednesday. The global forecast for the Asian markets suggests mild consolidation thanks to weak earnings news and economic data, plus a decline in the price of crude oil. The European and U.S. markets were down and the Asian bourses figure to follow suit. The KOSPI finished modestly lower on Tuesday as losses from the technology stocks and cosmetics companies were tempered by support from the financial shares and the automobile producers. For the day, the index shed 10.57 points or 0.52 percent to finish at 2,037.17 after trading between 2,031.25 and 2,042.65. Volume was 294 million shares worth 4.82 trillion won. There were 583 decliners and 232 gainers. Among the actives, Samsung Electronics lost 0.68 percent, while LG Electronics skidded 2.34 percent, Korea Electric Power shed 0.68 percent, AmorePacific plummeted 7.12 percent, SK hynix spiked 2.24 percent, Hyundai Motor advanced 2.6 percent, Kia Motors added 0.73 percent, Shinhan Financial collected 0.46 percent, Lotte Chemical climbed 1.64 percent and Hanjin Shipping tumbled 5.97 percent. The lead from Wall Street is soft as stocks moved lower on Tuesday, although the downside was fairly limited. The S&P 500 fell 8.17 points or 0.38 percent to 2,143.15, while the NASDAQ slid 26.43 points or 0.50 percent to 5,283.40 and the Dow lost 53.76 points or 0.30 percent to 18,169.27. The weakness came as traders reacted to the latest earnings news, with Sonic (SONC) reporting better than expected fiscal Q4 earnings but providing disappointing guidance. Also, Under Amour (UA) said its growth rate was slowing, while Procter & Gamble (PG) reported results that beat estimates.

The global forecast for the Asian markets suggests mild consolidation thanks to weak earnings news and economic data, plus a decline in the price of crude oil.

Tata Sons Ltd. directors were summoned to the group’s fabled Bombay House headquarters to discuss the sale of assets, its moribund U.K. steel business and the group’s legal wrangles with Japan’s NTT Docomo Inc., according to a person with knowledge of the events. But once the meeting started in the wood-paneled boardroom on the fourth floor, it took a different turn. Under a portrait of the formidable J R D Tata, the board wrested back chairmanship of the steel-to-software business empire for 78-year-old Ratan Tata, ousting his protege Cyrus Mistry, 48, in a coup that stunned India’s business community. Mistry said he was shocked at the nature of his dismissal and described the board meeting as illegal and invalid, according to an e-mail he sent to Tata directors. Ratan Tata had met Mistry earlier on Monday to present him with options, according to three people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the meeting was private. "I have to say that the Board of Directors has not covered itself with glory," Mistry said in the letter, a copy of which was seen by Bloomberg News. "To ‘replace’ your Chairman without so much as a word of explanation and without affording him an opportunity to defending himself in a summary manner must be unique in the annals of corporate history." In the e-mail, Mistry also warned that the tea-to-software giant may face 1.18 trillion rupees ($18 billion) in writedowns because of five unprofitable businesses he inherited. The rift had been brewing for months, said people who work with senior Tata executives and asked not to be named because the matter is private. It was a clash of styles, a feeling that Mistry, handpicked by Tata, wasn’t adhering to the traditional values of a company that had previously been led by a person related to the Tata family. Key to the showdown was a $1.17 billion legal battle with former partner Docomo over an Indian telecom venture. Docomo is trying to enforce a London Court of International Arbitration decision ordering Tata Sons to pay the sum for failing to uphold a contract. That venture was created during Ratan Tata’s 21-year period at the helm, and Mistry’s handling of the matter was seen by some as an erosion of the Tata Sons ethic of honoring commitments, according to the people. “The biggest challenge for an organization is planning for succession, especially following the tenure of a very successful CEO,” said Vijay Govindarajan, a professor at Dartmouth University’s Tuck School of Business. “The current leadership crisis is an unwanted distraction.” Mistry’s handling of troubles at other group businesses were also causing concern, according to the people, including the break-up of Tata Steel’s European empire, which Ratan Tata helped acquire. Spokesmen for Ratan Tata and Mistry declined to comment. For a QuickTake Q&A on Tata Group, click here. Yet if Mistry’s way of doing things was rankling the old guard, he also had successes in an increasingly difficult business climate. Ratan Tata had swelled group revenues more than 60-fold to $100 billion with a campaign of expansion abroad that included the troubled European steelmaker Corus Group Plc and marquee brands such as Land Rover, Jaguar, Tetley tea and New York’s Pierre hotel. With the slowdown in China dragging on global trade and Brexit concerns further damping European operations, Mistry was trying to unwind some of that growth and pay back part of the debt Tata had built up to pay for the acquisitions. And while the steel and power businesses were losing money, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., the group’s largest unit, has pushed into cloud computing and digital services to weather lackluster global IT spending, beating analysts’ estimates in the process. "I am stunned,” said S. Manikutty, a former professor at the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, who closely tracks Indian conglomerates and family businesses. “It was completely unexpected because Mr. Mistry was trying to remove important cobwebs from the Tata stable.” That didn’t save him. The day after his ouster, the corridors of Bombay House, Tata Group’s austere headquarters for 92 years in downtown Mumbai, were quiet, with most staff still in shock at the news. Traffic jammed the street outside, while reporters, TV crews and onlookers thronged the building. Media Speculation As rumors flew and media speculation mounted, Ratan Tata called together the chief executives of the group’s businesses to calm the ship. There would be continuity in all branches of the business without any issues, he told them in a 25-minute gathering, according to an executive who was present. Tata said he was keen to honor decisions made by Mistry, the person said. To read a Gadfly column on the Tata ouster, click here Ratan Tata is the latest in a long line of so-called boomerang CEOs who retook control after stepping down or being ousted. The late Steve Jobs revived Apple Inc. after more than a decade in the wilderness, A. G. Lafley made a two-year return performance at Procter & Gamble Co., Howard Schultz came back to give Starbucks Corp. another shot, and Narayana Murthy made a brief return as executive chairman at Tata’s IT rival Infosys Ltd. Now Ratan Tata’s search for a successor is back where it started. After grooming Mistry for a year before he took over, Tata and four other prominent leaders -- Venu Srinivasan, Amit Chandra, Ronen Sen and Kumar Bhattacharyya -- are part of the panel formed to find a new chairman within four months. For a story on Ratan Tata’s investment after stepping down in 2012, click here “This will mean another period of uncertainty to Tata stakeholders,” said Morgen Witzel, author of “Tata: The Evolution of a Corporate Brand.” He called the pledge to find a new leader within four months, “a heroic undertaking, given how long it took them to choose Mr. Mistry in the first place.” Tata himself has said that it’s not easy to spot a true leader. At a meeting with young entrepreneurs in Singapore in late March, he was asked about the qualities that make a chief. He responded that it wasn’t easy to tell how someone would respond until they were in the job. “The final test is crisis that one faces,” he answered at the time, speaking generally. “Someone who deals with that crisis with his sleeves rolled up, as against those who hold on, is finally the mark of a real leader.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.
