Analyst John Staszak pointed out that the company exited less profitable brands and focused on increasing the organic growth. Although it might look lean and mean, there is nothing to worry about profitability or productivity. He sees Procter & Gamble continuing its share buyback program and a regular hike in dividend supporting upside in shares as several investors look dividend as an attractive one. Procter & Gamble has been boosting its dividend for more than six decades, and the current dividend yield is estimated at 3.00 percent.

As a result, Argus thinks the shares are undervalued currently compared to the average 22–25 range on an annualized basis in the three-year period. "The company has taken steps to strengthen its business, including divesting Duracell in early 2016 and spinning off its beauty business to Coty in October. It is also working to reduce manufacturing costs and to boost organic growth by investing in R&D and increasing advertising spending," the brokerage said in a research note.

P&G CEO calls for patience in corporate transformation Alexander Coolidge , acoolidge@enquirer.com 1:10 p.m. EDT October 11, 2016 Buy Photo David Taylor, CEO of Procter & Gamble, speaks during the company's annual shareholders meeting at P&G headquarters, in downtown Cincinnati. (Photo: The Enquirer/Amanda Rossmann)Buy Photo Procter & Gamble CEO David Taylor told shareholders on Tuesday the consumer product giant's turnaround is progressing, but that it will take time for financial results to rebound. "We're moving in the right direction, but there's more work to be done," Taylor said. A week after radically cutting down P&G's product portfolio, Taylor said challenges ahead include growing sales in top markets, increasing the effectiveness of advertising and introducing innovative products that delight consumers. Taylor's remarks were made at the company's annual shareholders meeting held at its Downtown headquarters. In other business, P&G shareholders re-elected 10 board members, approved Deloitte & Touche as the independent auditor and an advisory vote on executive pay. Stockholders also rejected two shareholder proposals, one calling for a report on company lobbying efforts and another calling for a report on discriminatory state laws effect on the company. Last week, P&G completed the two-year process of divesting more than 100 brands with a massive split-off of 41 underperforming beauty labels such as CoverGirl makeup. The transaction merged the beauty brands – doing $4.5 billion in annual business – with New York's Coty Inc., which makes Calvin Klein perfume and Rimmel makeup. Since 2014, the Cincinnati-based firm also completed deals to sell Iams pet food and Duracell batteries. Taylor and other P&G executives have promised Wall Street that a smaller company will be easier to manage. And despite cutting away 14 percent of its sales, Taylor said the brands P&G kept are responsible for 94 percent of the company's profit. P&G has 10 product categories for its remaining 65 brands. Through a combination of buyouts, layoffs, attrition and brand sales, P&G has cut 34,000 jobs or 26.4 percent of its workforce since it announced a restructuring plan in 2012. Today, the company's payroll is now at its lowest level since 1991. CINCINNATI.COM P&G workforce shrinks to smallest in 25 years But P&G officials signaled more changes are on the way. Taylor said the company wants to cut an additional $10 billion in expenses by 2021. The company has already sold off nine U.S. factories through the brand-shedding deals, but it will likely continue reducing its manufacturing footprint. Two U.S. factories – one in Augusta, Georgia and one in Cayey, Puerto Rico – have already been shuttered. Another in Avenal, New Jersey, will close in 2018.

Home Industry Companies Cause marketing: Brands take causes to the centre of their campaigns Cause marketing: Brands take causes to the centre of their campaigns No longer are brand’s social campaigns about purchasing to contribute; the causes are now the campaign themselves, woven inextricably in the fabric of the story Updated: October 11, 2016 6:35 AM In keeping with the era of storytelling and selfies, brands have taken causes to the centre of the brand campaigns. Living as we are in a society that is divided by interests, defined by demographics and convinced of activism through click, like or share, it is but natural for cause marketing to take root and flourish. The concept of a brand espousing a cause by contributing a percentage of proceeds has been around for some time, cases in point being P&G and Parle where consumers were provided with the additional push to purchase the product by creating an opportunity for them to contribute for a good cause. The onus of activism was squarely on the shoulders of the brand. The consumer merely had to buy the brand in question to do his charitable act for a cause. In keeping with the era of storytelling and selfies, brands have taken causes to the centre of the brand campaigns. No longer are campaigns about purchasing to contribute; the causes are now the campaign themselves, woven inextricably in the fabric of the story and elevating from a brand commercial into a brand statement. However, for cause campaigns to resonate with the audience and create the desired impact it is essential that they ride on the backbone of solid marketing sense. No matter how good the story or how worthy the cause, if it does not resonate with the brand then the message will fall flat and seem forced to the content-weary consumer. Cause marketing: How good can it be? P&G for instance set the bar with its rousing Proud sponsor of moms campaign which it aligned superbly with the Olympics — summer and winter — coming up with a new story each time to appreciate either the strength, affection or perseverance of the mother behind the scenes. No doubt the story hit home and tugged at the heartstrings. If you unravel the campaign and lay it shorn of all its trappings you will see a shrewd marketing strategy to play to the galleries — the mothers in this case, driven by research which possibly pointed towards them being the primary buyers and purchase decision makers. Ariel’s Share the Load campaign is another example of shrewd positioning and targeting and if I may add, great punning, while also advocating the need for urban men to share the load of household chores. Do notice that it did not take a similar stand with rural products where its cause will be frowned upon. Undoubtedly, cause marketing enables brands to connect at an emotional level with the consumer which helps them stand out amidst the clutter and influence purchase decisions. It converts customers into brand advocates — a dream come true for any marketing manager worth her salt. Another case in point and a personal favourite are the Dove campaigns championing the cause of real beauty for real women. Over the years, Dove has stood steadfast and committed in its stand for real beauty and has given us some truly memorable campaigns be it You are more beautiful that you think or the more recent Change the Rhyme campaign. The timing of the ad couldn’t have been accidental — synced as it was with the nationwide adulation of women at large, thanks to the only Indian medal winners at the Rio Olympics being women. For a cause campaign to truly work for the brand at the till, it has to necessarily connect instinctively with the brand promise in the consumer’s mind. However subtle it may be, unless the cause connects convincingly and effortlessly with the brand statement it might just land up being a great video with no brand impact. The Nescafé campaign featuring a stuttering stand-up comedian who makes a new start, while addressing the social stigma of stuttering also connected beautifully to the brand statement of It all starts with Nescafé. Another example of cause marketing that was further amplified by an on-ground activity was the transparency campaign from Nirmal coconut oil. Connecting with the clamour for transparency from godmen, politicians and even motorists, and coinciding with the regulation to remove sunfilms from car windows and windscreens for greater transparency, the brand ably connected the cause with its transparent bottles. An on-ground activity that offered to remove car sunfilms for free further amplified and validated the campaign. Dabur Vatika’s salute to cancer survivors was another hard-hitting campaign that addressed the common perception of hair being synonymous with beauty and assured women who had survived chemotherapy that their resilience set them apart and made them more beautiful. To sum up, a cause campaign is still a marketing campaign and unless it adheres to the 5W and 1H, is rooted in solid research, maintains contextual relevance and while doing all this clearly connects with the brand promise, it will fail to bring money for the jam.

The campaign, executed on behalf of Revlon, marks the beginning of an exclusive, strategic South African partnership between MediaCom’s content division, MediaCom Beyond Advertising (MBA), and indaHash. Due to the fact that indaHash will be exclusively distributed through MediaCom in South Africa, all agencies and advertisers have the opportunity to utilise this unique technology through the MBA division. Following successful launches in countries such as Poland, Germany and the UK, South Africa will be another market that will benefit from indaHash’s unique ability to automate collaboration between brands and digital influencers. With an international platform that is fully automated, indaHash revolutionises the process of collaboration between brands and digital influencers. It was established at the beginning of 2016 and has since gathered over 65 000 influencers, steadily captured new markets, and executed more than 200 campaigns for some of the world’s biggest brands, such as Coca-Cola, P&G, McDonald’s, and L’Oreal. A ground-breaking digital partnership As a new strategic partner of MediaCom, one of the largest content and media agencies worldwide, indaHash will be made available to all MediaCom clients, as well as other agencies in South Africa that wish to use the platform for their own client campaigns. Federico Dedeu, Head of MediaCom Beyond Advertising – which is the MediaCom division that will be working with indaHash the most frequently – says that the company is very excited to be partnering with indaHash, as it’s going to revolutionise the way brands are able to work with influencers. “We have been consistently seeing the true value of this marketing method,” continues Mr. Dedeu. “The technology enables brands to easily work with 1 or 100 influencers at a time, as it manages the contracts and the different payment models. This means that budgets can work harder than ever before. Over and above this, brands retain the rights to the assets created by the influencers, which have real production cost savings.” Setting the momentum for great digital moments Joanna Pawluk, Managing Partner at indaHash, says that in the case of South Africa, indaHash decided to enter the market with a different business model. “Instead of building a local team,” Ms. Pawluk explains, “we decided on a strategic partnership with MediaCom. As indaHash, we are delivering the technology on a daily basis that is used successfully by some of the biggest agencies and media houses worldwide. We are happy that, together with MediaCom, we will now be able to deliver the best campaigns involving influencers in South Africa.” The first campaign in South Africa will involve the marketing of Revlon’s Great Moments competition. The influencers were asked, through the indaHash app, to select one of the prize holidays, take a photo of the indispensable items they would take along for an expedition, and add Revlon deodorant to the picture. Additionally, influencers will tell their followers about the competition and encourage them to participate. The competition runs until October 31st. For indaHash, Joanna Pawluk will be responsible for the development and launch of the platform in the South African market, while Mediacom Beyond Advertising will be represented by Federico Dedeu.

Her breadth of experiences has led to her invitation to join Forbes Agency Council. Ann Arbor, MI, October 12, 2016 --(PR.com)-- Ida Abdalkhani, Founder & Chief Catalyzer at Ability to Engage, a boutique consultancy that specializes in brand building, marketing, innovation and consumer research, has been accepted into the Forbes Agency Council, an invitation-only community for executives in successful public relations, media strategy, creative and advertising agencies. Ability to Engage was hand-selected as one of the first members of this special community. In recent years, Ability to Engage has grown over 300% and works across the globe with some of the world’s largest and most respected companies in brand and marketing such as Clorox, ConAgra Foods, McGraw Hill, PepsiCo, Pfizer, and Procter & Gamble, as well as start-ups, non-profits, universities, and government groups. Ida’s dedication to the pursuit of curiosity and the power within every individual for innovation has made her a sought after speaker at local, regional and national events. Scott Gerber, founder of Forbes Councils, says, “We are honored to welcome Ida Abdalkhani into the community. Our mission with Forbes Councils is to curate successful professionals from every industry, creating a vetted, social capital-driven network that helps every member make an even greater impact on the business world.” Ida grew up in the small, Midwestern, town of Lima, Ohio. She went on to become a Buckeye, holding an MBA, BSBA, and BA from The Ohio State University. While growing up in Lima, Ida’s natural creativity, leadership, and sense of entrepreneurship started to take form. While still in elementary school, she and a friend developed a newspaper, The 4th Grade Times and she went door-to-door with a neighborhood friend selling handmade jewelry. During high school, Ida started “Help Your Community Day,” bringing classmates, teachers, and administrators together to volunteer in the community once-a-month. Ida’s curiosity only grew when she went to college. She was the President of Ohio State’s student-run entrepreneurship group an went on to declare entrepreneurship as one of her majors. However, after graduation, she did not become an entrepreneur. Ida interned at The Coca-Cola Company and Procter & Gamble and found she loved the world of marketing and brand. She went on to become a global brand manager at P&G. However, Ida felt a need for more opportunities to discover and create. She resigned from her job and went backpacking around the world - visiting approximately 50 countries over 8 months! During her travels, Ida realized that traditional consumer insight methods and related marketing were only scratching the surface of what was possible to connect with audiences on a deeper level. Ida started developing methods for deeper insights and innovation when she returned from her travels, and the journey creating Ability to Engage began. “People will always be at the core of what I do. I am driven by helping people better understand themselves, and the world around them. It’s what motivates me to continue digging deep and innovating through Ability to Engage.” Contact Information Ability to Engage Sandra Saavedra 657-464-4320 Contact www.AbilityToEngage.com Click here to view the list of recent Press Releases from Ability to Engage Promote Your Business Affiliate Program Link To Us Email this page to a friend PR.com Contact Us About Us Terms of Use Help

Home Mail Search News Cricket Movies Lifestyle Celebrity Flickr Mobile Answers More Yahoo Search Search Mail News Home Follow us National World US Elections Finance Cricket Lifestyle Sports Good News Videos Autos From the Godman’s Goody Bag pubali 9 October 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share In the fiercely competitive FMCG (acronym for Fast Moving Consumer Goods) space, where even well-entrenched players find it difficult to hold on to their market share, India’s self-styled godman and yoga guru Ramdev has scripted a path-breaking success story. His company – Patanjali Ayurved Ltd. – raked in a whopping INR 5000 crore in revenue in 2015-16 and is on its way to double that next year, giving global industry giants like Unilever, P&G and ColgatePalmolive a run for their money. This growth story appears all the more eye-popping when one takes into consideration the fact that Patanjali scaled these dizzying heights by swearing off the marketing rulebook. Minus erudite honchos, market research and big stars endorsing its products, to find out how the high priest of yoga doubled as a savvy purveyor of a wide array of consumer goods, read on… View photos Success by serendipity It all started circa 2004. The story goes like this: In a bid to help farmers struggling to offload their produce like gooseberries (amla in Hindi) and aloe vera, Ramdev started buying from them at a fair price. The breakout sales of its amla juice product soon resulted in Patanjali’s profits soaring. Encouraged, Ramdev, along with the company’s co-founder Acharya Balkrishna, started launching products left and right. Today, Patanjali, Divya Pharmacy (the Ayurvedic medicine manufacturing company set up in 1995) and Patanjali Gram Udyoga Unit produce close to 800 products ranging from dairy and beauty products to textile, noodles, cornflakes and cookies. View photos Organic Growth Overall Companies that make it big in a short while, mostly do so by swallowing smaller companies, or merging with competitors, or both. The process is called inorganic growth. But in case of Patanjali, it grew all on its own, i.e. organically, by upping profits through product development and increasing its customer base. Patanjali launched every conceivable product it anticipated would have demand at ultra-competitive prices for the mass market. And it clicked!  What was established in 2006 as a cottage industry grew to become a force in the FMCGs sector. View photos Acharya Balkrishna: An Unusual Billionaire Though Ramdev is the poster boy for Patanjali, he does not own any share in the company, since he is a self-proclaimed Hindu ascetic. It is his childhood friend, close associate and co-founder of Patanjali, Acharya Balkrishna, who owns 97 percent stake in Patanjali Ayurved Ltd. He has even featured in Forbes magazine’s rich list in India this year at the 48th position. His net worth was pegged at US $2.5 billion. Interestingly, Balkrishna does not draw a salary and devotes 15 hours every day to the company without taking a single day off. Read More The remaining shares in the company are held by Sarwan ‘Sam’ Poddar and his wife Sunita, both residents of Scotland. View photos Offbeat Marketing Strategy Patanjali steered clear of multi-million marketing strategies of big corporate houses. Instead, it relied on old-school methods like word-of-mouth to popularise the product initially.  It helped, of course, that that Ramdev pitched the initial products to the multitudes that throng his yoga camps across the country and the millions that follow him on television. Further, unlike corporate giants, Patanjali just launched a flurry of products – sometimes even simultaneously – without any market research. Ramdev and his lieutenants just went ahead with their gut instinct, which paid off. Two of its unique selling points are chemical-free products and dirt-cheap prices. The latter is achieved by buying raw materials directly from farmers without middlemen. Patanjali started advertising its products after a point in time though, but no celebrity has been roped in. Instead, it’s Ramdev who is at the centre of these ads. Swadeshi (Indian made) is the buzzword and it has caught the popular public imagination. The current BJP government’s campaign on ‘Make in India’ is also helping Patanjali position itself at the forefront of this movement, further helping its sales. Till 2011, Patanjali products were sold through exclusive franchise stores and health centres where free ayurvedic consultation was provided. Post that, it started retail outlets resulting in multiplied sales and compounded profits. View photos Goods Galore An estimated 800 products today come under brand Patanjali. While listing all is not possible, some of the runaway hits are definitely worth a mention. Clarified butter (ghee), for example, is the top revenue generator. Next in popularity are toothpaste and hairoil/shampoo. In fact, Patanjali’s toothpaste Dant Kanti has almost knocked the breath out of a Goliath in the FMCG sector – Colgate. To regain its lost market share, Colgate is being forced to launch a toothpaste this quarter using all-natural ingredients. Besides, there have been products that don’t quite tally with the brand’s image like instant noodles, and beauty products. But Ramdev claims they all have a swadeshi twist, something that sets them apart. Patanjali now plans to expand further into other mass markets such as apparel – with the launch of denim jeans – and baby care products. View photos False Claims? However, it seems that not all of the yoga guru’s claims about his company are true. Patanjali outsources manufacturing of certain products, which is contrary to Ramdev’s assertion that everything is manufactured in-house. Biscuits, for example, are made by Delhi-based Sona Biscuits that also purveys biscuits under Sobisco brand. The aloe vera unit, reported an English newspaper, uses pulp supplied by Dhandev Resorts and Health Care Pvt. Ltd, a Jaisalmer-based company owned by a Congress politician, for aloe vera juice. This is against statements that the company uses produce from its own aloe vera plantations. Over 200 scientists, who research and develop Patanjali products at the company’s Haridwar headquarters, are forbidden from interacting with outsiders. Security is also tight, with Central Industrial Security Forces (CISF) jawans deployed at the manufacturing unit in Haridwar, and media being denied access to several parts of the campus. Work Culture at Patanjali Unlike its competitors, Patanjali does not recruit from B-schools. It procures talent from its network, or by advertising. And so far it has created direct and indirect employment for around 15,000 people. Payscales are not on par with others, though. And most join the company driven by some voluntary zeal. But, notably, Patanjali Ayurved boasts of a gender diversity ratio of 30:70. The work culture at Patanjali is unique too, in keeping with the image of the brand. Instead of the staple corporate world greetings, people are greeted with 'Om’ there. Smoking, drinking and eating meat are prohibited. Future Plans Emboldened by the phenomenal success and flush with funds, Ramdev’s immediate plans are to achieve a turnover of ₹10,000 crore! For that, the company needs to add to its manufacturing capacity. Its Haridwar campus – an industrial zone named Padartha – already has 28 factories, and research and development facilities. Ramdev and his team now plan to set up food and herbal parks in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Assam and even Nepal as a next step. View photos Imitators Inspired by the roaring success of Patanjali, a couple of other self-styled godmen too have forayed into business with ayurveda-based products. Sri Sri Ravishankar, founder of Art of Living, has launched consumer goods under the brand name of Sri Sri Ayurveda. Again, Gurmeet Ram Rahim, the Dera chief popularly referred to as Rockstar baba, has founded a company promoting organic products. None, so far, have tasted success anywhere close to what Baba Ramdev has.

Conway G. Gittens reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Alibaba works its magic on the first day of going public, but the pizzazz is largely contained to its stock alone. The Dow crept up to another record closing high, but the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were down for the day. For the week: The Dow gained 1.7 percent and the Nasdaq was flat. Alibaba shares surged to nearly $100 in their opening day after the Chinese e-commerce company successfully completed the world's biggest IPO ever. Closing the day with a market cap of more than $231 billion, Alibaba is more valuable than well-known international brands like JP Morgan Chase, Procter and Gamble and Coca-Cola. Morris Mark of Mark Asset Management owns tech stocks like Yahoo and says Alibaba is a great company. SOUNDBITE: MORRIS MARK, FOUNDER, MARK ASSET MANAGEMENT (ENGLISH) SAYING: "This is really a good company. It really has established a fabulous franchise in the world's largest and fastest growing Internet market, in a country that's underserved by physical infrastructure." Shares of Alibaba ended with a 38 percent gain, below that century price. But Yahoo, which sold 8 billion dollars worth of its stake in Alibaba, gave up all gains to end the session lower. Chinese Internet company Baidu - another tech loser - as Alibaba gets the cash to grow even bigger. The other big story of the day: Apple. A mob scene at Apple stores around the world. The masses flocked to buy the iPhone 6 and the larger screen 6 plus. Both devices are aimed at catching up to rival Samsung, which until recently had much success with larger screen smartphones. Analysts expect opening weekend sales to range between 8 to 12 million handsets. Shares of Apple finished the session nearly down a full percent. Oracle shares slumping one day after the surprise departure of Larry Ellison as CEO, but stay on as executive chairman. It's not the kind of big you want to be. Home Depot admits to the biggest credit card security breach in retail history. 56 million or so credit and debit cards were compromised, eclipsing the 40 million compromised at Target. Home Depot says the tab so far is estimated to be $62 million. Shares of the home improvement retailer end the day higher. In Europe - sighs of relief as the United Kingdom avoids being broken up by Scottish voters. But the market did not have much energy and finished the day flat.

Watch: 'Aftab!' duck to quack on local TV Politics Extra Jason Williams , jwilliams@enquirer.com 8:54 p.m. EDT October 11, 2016 540 Shares Aftab Pureval's political ad  (Photo: Provided) Get used to hearing the Aflac duck quacking all over local television again. Well, actually it'll be quacking "Aftab!" – promoting rookie candidate Aftab Pureval for Hamilton County Clerk of Courts. The Democrat's spot hits airwaves on Wednesday, the start of an all-out ad blitz on local TV leading up to the Nov. 8 election. Pureval has reserved nearly $125,000 in ad time on Cincinnati's FOX, CBS, NBC and ABC affiliates, according to federal records. That's a lot of money to spend on advertising for a clerk of courts race, but Pureval is aggressively trying to gain recognition. The Procter & Gamble attorney is the underdog in a race against big-name Republican incumbent Tracy Winkler. The blitz will start with a 30-second spot featuring a yellow duck puppet quacking "Aftab!" as the candidate addresses a group of people. It's a play off the Aflac commercials that debuted in the early 2000s. Couch potatoes nationwide came to know the insurance company quite well for its duck mascot loudly quacking "Aflac!" It led to people quacking "Aflac!" in offices, schools and around the house. Pureval hopes his ad helps his name stick in the minds of voters. "I know Aftab is a unique name," Pureval told Politics Extra last summer. "I'll speak to groups and months later, someone will come up and say, 'I don't remember everything you said, but I do know you're the Aflac guy.' I'm running on serious issues about how to reform our courts, but if thinking of that duck helps people remember my name, then people can quack 'Aftab' at me all over Hamilton County." Pureval is the second local candidate to spoof a nationally recognized name. Hamilton County commissioner candidate Andrew Pappas spoofed 1980s TV hit series "Knight Rider" with "The Pappas Mobile" in June. New York Post and Cleveland Plain Dealer reporters thought the ad was campy enough to mention it, and "The Pappas Mobile" has been viewed nearly 8,200 times on YouTube.

Schools to voters: 'We need help' Hannah Sparling , hsparling@enquirer.com 4:43 p.m. EDT October 11, 2016 Cincinnati Public Schools and Cincinnati Preschool Promise want $48 million a year from taxpayers. Do they need it? And are you willing to pay it? Buy Photo Maricha Butler canvasses Kennedy Heights in support of Issue 44. (Photo: The Enquirer/Kareem Elgazzar)Buy Photo We’ll be upfront: This is a story about numbers. But it's also about a tiny group of people who hatched a plan to save the city’s toddlers. It’s about hardworking homeowners weary of taxes floating up, up, up. It’s about politics, school funding and an urban system facing big budget shortfalls if nothing changes. There's a lot involved in Issue 44, the joint $48 million a year levy for Cincinnati Public Schools and Cincinnati Preschool Promise. But which numbers matter? What do they mean? And how should you vote? The answers depend on whom you ask. Here's Greg Landsman, Preschool Promise strategic adviser and one of the main organizers behind the levy. Landsman says he knows budgets are tight, but investing now saves way more down the line: "This is a must-have levy, not a nice-to-have. At some point, without this levy, teachers will lose their jobs. Students will be packed in the classrooms, and schools may shut their doors." But here's Brad Beckett, chair of the Coalition Opposed to Additional Spending and Taxes. Beckett says homeowners are overtaxed as-is, and CPS doesn't deserve any more money: "They have not shown themselves to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars. The taxpayer is just getting hit left and right. At what point do we stop and say, 'Enough is enough'?" On Nov. 8, voters will decide. If Issue 44 passes and you own a home in the district, you'll pay an extra $278 a year for every $100,000 of home value. If you own a $50,000 home, that's an extra $139. A $200,000 home? That will cost you $555 more. Numbers can get dull, we know. But these are incredibly important numbers, and the stakes are high no matter which side you take. John Pepper, former Procter & Gamble CEO and a levy backer, calls it a moral question, a “vote against poverty.” “This is our game to win,” Pepper told The Enquirer editorial board in September. “If we don’t succeed on this, shame on us.” Buy Photo Seyha Maliab works on an art activity that also helps with multiplication at Chase Elementary School. Chase is now an arts school, part of CPS' efforts to strengthen its neighborhood schools with specific programming.  (Photo: The Enquirer/Cara Owsley) ‘We need help’ If the levy passes, $15 million a year will go to preschool expansion. Preschool Promise has been campaigning for years on the platform that preschool – done right and offered equally to all kids – will transform the city. If kids go to kindergarten prepared, they’re more likely to graduate and less likely to end up in prison. The return on an investment in preschool, according to a recent study, could be as high as 4:1. But a much larger chunk of the levy money, $33 million a year, will go to CPS for k-12 education.The school district participated in an outside review of its finances – paid for by members of the business community – and it shows this: Buy Photo Teacher Brian Huhtala helps Yamaya Lee during band class at Chase Elementary School.  (Photo: The Enquirer/Cara Owsley) At first blush, it looks like CPS is facing a $60 million annual deficit by 2021, an average $35-million-a-year hole for each of the next five years. Part of the review was a hunt for savings, though, and the study found some – anywhere between $7 million and $15 million a year, depending on the next round of union negotiations. One idea, for example, is to raise the cap on class size, thus eliminating millions of dollars in overload pay to teachers with more students. Expenses will go up no matter what. Inflation plays a role; every year, for example, school supplies cost more. And, as teachers get more education and more experience, their salaries automatically jump, even without a base pay increase.  New technology is also pricey. When Ohio switched from paper-pencil to online testing, CPS had to buy 17,000 new computers, build a new wireless infrastructure and hire people to manage it. In 2014-15, CPS spent a combined $4.1 million on testing computers and expenses related to My Tomorrow, a district initiative centered heavily on technology. In 2014-15, that expense was $7.6 million. And of the levy's $33 million a year, $8.8 million is carved out for expanded/improved technology. A decade ago, CPS was in trouble. Charter schools – publicly funded but privately run – were the new, hot thing, and CPS was losing students. Then, the state introduced vouchers – free tickets to private school for students in the worst-performing public schools – and CPS lost more students. Enrollment went down, down, down. CPS sold or demolished 13 buildings and cut thousands of teaching jobs. But in 2012, the numbers turned. The state predicted the district would have 28,000 students this year, but it has 35,000. And politicians are on a mission to shut down shoddy charter schools, so CPS is likely to get even more students back. The district will gladly take them, said Superintendent Mary Ronan, and she thinks CPS can offer a better education than most charters, anyway. But “eight years is a long time,” she said, pointing to the last time CPS got a new-money levy from taxpayers as opposed to a renewal. “We need help.” School funding in Ohio is structured to remain steady. It won’t tank during a recession, but it won’t grow in the good times, either. So, without a levy, CPS' revenue will stay relatively flat. Even with a levy, said treasurer Jen Wagner, the district will have to make choices about what to fund and what to drop. CPS gets about 40 percent of its money from the state – roughly tied with Columbus for the lowest rate among Ohio's eight urban districts. So, CPS relies heavily on local taxpayers. School funding in Ohio is confusing, and the method has been ruled unconstitutional. But that ruling was 19 years ago, and the system still stands. It’s not fair, Ronan said, but for now, that's how it works. Buy Photo 3rd-grader Saniyah Trotter works on an art project that incorporates math at Chase Elementary School.  (Photo: The Enquirer/Cara Owsley) ‘Nothing to brag about’ Beckett, from COAST, is tired of hearing about how CPS is the best urban school in the state. He looks at the district’s latest report card, where it earned two Ds and four Fs on overall grades, and he is not impressed. “Bragging because you’re the top of the bottom is certainly nothing to brag about,” he said. COAST members voted in August to oppose the school levy. It has nothing to do with Preschool Promise, Beckett said, but since the levies are combined, COAST is against the whole ticket. It’s sad, he said, that the school district politicized preschool by attaching it to its “huge levy increase.” Taxes trickle down, Beckett said. Sure, the money might go toward programs that help poor kids in school. But if those same poor kids live in an apartment complex where the rent is raised because of the tax, what’s the gain? At some point, Beckett said, the scale will tip: Taxes will drive people out of the city, and there will be no one left to tax. Buy Photo A line of Issue 44 campaign signs.  (Photo: The Enquirer/Kareem Elgazzar) Ohio House candidate Matthew Wahlert warns the levy comes with a hidden cost: a hurdle to minorities who want to buy property. As taxes go up, Wahlert wrote in a letter to the editor, property ownership becomes less and less realistic for those on the financial fence, often minorities. Other opponents, in letters and emails to The Enquirer, talk about uncertainty regarding how the money will be spent; a distrust of the CPS school board and those leading the preschool expansion; and a simple unwillingness to pay more. “Find another way to fix your budget," wrote one such homeowner. "The rest of us do and do not have others giving us levy money to assist us.” It's unclear how active opponents will be. The pro-levy side has a campaign office, strategists and hordes of volunteers. Beckett won’t say what resources – human or otherwise – COAST will dedicate to its fight, but it’s a volunteer organization, so its pockets are shallow. That might matter on Election Day. Opposition also seems largely targeted toward CPS specifically rather than the preschool expansion, but there’s only one ballot initiative, so there’s no picking and choosing. It’s both, or it’s neither. That matters, too. Buy Photo Hope Johnston-Holm of Pleasant Ridge gathers campaign signs at the Issue 44 campaign headquarters in Walnut Hills.  (Photo: The Enquirer/Kareem Elgazzar) Two paths On a Monday afternoon, volunteers pack the Issue 44 campaign headquarters in Walnut Hills. Some are stuffing, stamping and sticking address labels on letters bound for potential donors. Others are prepping to head out for door-to-door canvassing or phone banking. There are stacks of yard signs, buttons, stickers and fliers – strong START, strong FUTURE, vote for 44. Landsman, who has spent the better part of four years pushing for preschool, sees two paths. If the levy fails, there will be no preschool expansion. Cincinnati’s child poverty rate will stay where it is, the city schools will get worse and the city itself will follow. If it passes, he said, Cincinnati will have a more competitive workforce because it will be a more attractive place for families. Home values will go up. Poverty and crime will go down. Now, it's up to voters – what they value, whom they believe and what they think works for schools and cities. Every night at the Issue 44 headquarters, volunteers make call after call to potential supporters. They follow a simple script, saying who they are and why they're calling. Then, they ask the $48 million question: Can we count on your support? On mobile?

By Morris Propp Biography April 11, 2015 Warren Buffett is fond of saying his tax rate is lower than his secretary’s. He does not publicize his tax returns, but for the tax year 2010, he paid $6.9 million on taxable income of $39.8 million, according to partial disclosures he made in 2011. What is astounding about those numbers is not the 17.3% tax rate, but that Buffett’s $39.8 million of taxable income is only about 0.05% of his reported net worth ($71 billion according to Forbes, which put him third on its list of the 400 wealthiest people in the world for 2015). Proportionately, that’s like someone with an ever-expanding net worth, currently $10 million, reporting taxable income of only $5,000 and paying a federal tax bill of only $900. So, how does he do it? Buffett’s principal holding is an economic interest of about 20% of Berkshire Hathaway, BRKA 0.5510701012431116% Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Cl B U.S.: NYSE USD156.92 0.86 0.5510701012431116% /Date(1478901822601-0600)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 4467729 AFTER HOURS USD157 0.08 0.05098139179199592% Volume (Delayed 15m) : 46678 P/E Ratio 16.62869435289879 Market Cap 386643622827.439 Dividend Yield N/A Rev. per Employee 657257 More quote details and news » BRKA in Your Value Your Change Short position the huge conglomerate he has been building since the 1960s. It has a market value of about $350 billion. Berkshire hasn’t paid any cash dividends since 1967. Rather, the company accumulates its prodigious after-tax income ($19.9 billion in 2014) and cash flow ($32 billion in 2014) to get bigger by buying companies, lots of companies. Among its large recent acquisitions were Lubrizol, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, and a shared acquisition of H.J. Heinz. KHC -0.2579218865143699% Kraft Heinz Co. U.S.: Nasdaq USD81.21 -0.21 -0.2579218865143699% /Date(1478901600393-0600)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 4063980 AFTER HOURS USD81.68 0.47 0.5787464597955917% Volume (Delayed 15m) : 87081 P/E Ratio 35.61842105263158 Market Cap 98854497171.6888 Dividend Yield 2.9553010712966383% Rev. per Employee 636929 More quote details and news » KHC in Your Value Your Change Short position The Berkshire Model is to buy companies rich in cash flow with histories of paying dividends, then cancel those dividends and retain the cash flow going forward for future acquisitions. HOW MUCH TAX is Warren Buffett able to avoid by fixing Berkshire’s dividend at zero? The dividend yield of the Standard & Poor’s 500 is about 2%. The price/earnings ratio of the S&P 500 is about 18. Thus, for the S&P 500, approximately 30% of earnings are paid out to shareholders. These dividends are taxable at a current maximum rate of 23.8%. If Berkshire followed the average of the S&P 500, it would have paid out about $6 billion in dividends in 2014, and Buffett’s share would have been about $1.2 billion. At a 23.8% tax rate, that would have given Buffett a tax bill of $280 million, or about 40 times the taxes he said he actually paid in 2010. Thus the Treasury has been getting exiguous tax revenue from one of its wealthiest citizens. Buffett is virtually immune to higher individual income-tax rates, while he promotes higher rates for other rich people, who may have a net worth a hundredth of 1% (0.01%) of his own. Since, according to his publicly stated plans, Buffett intends to leave the bulk of his estate to charity, his estate won’t be paying much tax, either. The Buffett Loophole and the Berkshire Model are allowing one individual to build one of the great American fortunes while avoiding individual taxes. Talk about someone not paying his share! FOR 2014, BERKSHIRE ITSELF recorded a provision for $7.9 billion in taxes, most of which was “deferred.” In fact Berkshire, like many other companies, is able to defer much of its taxes, in its case $61 billion. This is money it acknowledges it owes the government but has yet to pay. Deferred tax liabilities are the difference between taxes that will come due in the future and what the company owes today. Accounting rules require this difference to be recognized as a liability, but it ultimately acts as a sort of “float” that the government allows companies in the midst of an acquisition—which Berkshire almost always is. In 2012, the year before it was acquired for $28 billion by Berkshire (and a Brazilian partner), H.J. Heinz paid more than $600 million in dividends. Those dividends were taxed and provided revenue to the U.S. Treasury. After the acquisition, the dividends stopped. Tax revenue from those dividends stopped. In 2010, the year before it was acquired by Berkshire for $9 billion, Lubrizol paid $90 million in dividends. After the acquisition, the dividends stopped, as did tax revenue on the dividends. In 2009, the year before it was acquired by Berkshire for $44 billion, Burlington Northern Santa Fe paid $546 million in dividends. After the acquisition, the dividends stopped, as did tax revenue on the dividends. LAST YEAR, Berkshire entered into what became known as a “cash-rich split-off” that, according to the New York Times, might have allowed it to avoid $1 billion in taxes. Berkshire traded its stock in Procter & Gamble, PG 0.7473481195756991% Procter & Gamble Co. U.S.: NYSE USD83.58 0.62 0.7473481195756991% /Date(1478901637344-0600)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 8856300 AFTER HOURS USD83.44 -0.14 -0.16750418760469013% Volume (Delayed 15m) : 49369 P/E Ratio 23.25283774760739 Market Cap 223659493146.96 Dividend Yield 3.204115817181144% Rev. per Employee 621810 More quote details and news » PG in Your Value Your Change Short position which carried a low cost basis of $336 million, for P&G’s Duracell unit plus $1.7 billion in cash, a total value of $4.7 billion. The point was to reduce capital-gains taxes that would have been due on a sale of Berkshire’s P&G stock. It seems that Buffett and his businesses are serial deprivers of tax revenue to the U.S. Treasury. Yet that does not deter him from loudly advocating higher income tax rates for others. However unethical the Buffett Loophole and the Berkshire Model may seem, however much they may appear to be gaming the tax code, no one has claimed they are illegal. Now consider Section 531 of the Internal Revenue Code, which imposes a 20% tax on the accumulated but undistributed income of a corporation. And Section 532 of the Code states that the tax shall apply to “every corporation…availed of for the purpose of avoiding of the income tax with respect to its shareholders…by permitting earnings and profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed.” The Buffett Loophole and the Berkshire Model provide clear examples of the purpose of Sections 531 and 532. Buffett and Berkshire are accomplishing precisely what the code is trying to prevent: shareholders getting away without paying taxes. Enforcement of these two sections has been sporadic, subject to the judgment of the Internal Revenue Service. An official commentary on the code, Federal Tax Coordinator 2d, D-3003, states that, for enforcement of the accumulated-earnings tax, “Congress did not want the taxing authorities second-guessing the responsible managers of corporations as to whether and to what extent profits should be distributed or retained, unless the taxing authorities were in a position to prove their position was correct.” CAN THE IRS CONTEND that Berkshire’s purchase of Duracell was not essential for its Heinz holding, for its Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad, or for its core insurance businesses? Of course. Can the IRS see that by looking the other way it has unreasonably feathered Buffett’s nest, allowing him to avoid paying reasonable taxes? Of course it can. It chooses not to see anything. The relationship between the Wizard of Wall Street and our president is symbiotic. The two scratch each other’s back at the expense of the commonweal. How nice for our president, who is so eager to spread the wealth around, to have one of our richest citizens militating for higher taxes on the rich. How nice for Buffett to play to an adoring crowd of wealth-spreaders. How strange that it’s not his wealth that they are spreading around.  MORRIS PROPP, a former aerospace scientist and options pioneer, is a private investor.

The release of quarterly results from Alcoa is seen as the unofficial start of earnings season, with financial giants Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) due to report their results later this week. Overall trading activity may be somewhat subdued, however, as some traders may stay on the sidelines amid a lack of major U.S. economic data. The minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting and reports on retail sales and producer prices are likely to attract attention in the coming days. U.S. stocks closed Monday's session higher amid a rally in crude oil prices. The major averages opened higher and moved roughly sideways until early afternoon trading. After giving back some of their gains over the remainder of the session, the averages ended moderately higher. The Dow Industrials added 88.55 points or 0.49 percent before ending at 18,329, the S&P 500 Index ended up 9.92 points or 0.46 percent at 2,164 and the Nasdaq Composite closed at 5,329, up 36.27 points or 0.69 percent. Eighteen of the thirty Dow components ended the session higher and four stocks were little changed, while the remaining eight stocks retreated. Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), Boeing (BA), Merck (MRK) and Apple (AAPL) were among the biggest gainers of the session, but Procter & Gamble (PG) and Wal-Mart (WMT) fell sharply. Among the sectors, energy, banking, airline and telecom stocks turned in some of the best performances on the day. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures for November delivery are slipping $0.34 to $51.01 a barrel after ending Monday's session up $1.54 at $51.35 a barrel, the highest closing level since July 15th, 2015. Meanwhile, an ounce of gold is currently trading at $1,258, down $2.40 from the previous session's close of $1,260.40. On Monday, gold rose $8.90, snapping a 6-session losing streak. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 103.64 yen compared to the 103.61 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Monday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1090 compared to yesterday's $1.1139. Asia The Asian markets closed mixed, with the Singapore, South Korean, Taiwanese and Hong Kong markets declining, while the rest of the markets advanced. The Indian market was closed for a public holiday. The Japanese market, which opened after Monday's public holiday, advanced as the yen remained weak. The Nikkei 225 Index opened higher and rose steadily in the morning. Although there was a slight loss of momentum by the mid-session, the index consolidated in the afternoon, closing up 164.67 points or 0.98 percent at a more than 1-month high of 17,025. Food, chemical, pharma, export, utility, telecom and most resource stocks gained ground, while some housing, real estate, steel, financial and retail stocks came under selling pressure. Australia's All Ordinaries Index ended modestly higher, although well off its best levels. The index ended at 5,562, up 6.70 points or 0.12 percent. Energy and material stocks rallied strongly and consumer and utility stocks saw moderate strength, but most other sectors lost ground. China's Shanghai Composite Index closed 17.11 points or 0.56 percent higher at 3,065, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surrendered all its morning gains by early afternoon trading and languished below the unchanged line thereafter. The index ended down 302.30 points or 1.27 percent at 23,550. On the economic front, the results of a survey by National Australia Bank showed that confidence among businesses in Australia was unchanged in September. The corresponding index was static at 6, although above the expected reading of 5. The business conditions index rose 1 point to 8. A report released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that the total number of home loans issued in Australia fell 3 percent month-over-month in August. This was steeper than the 1.5 percent drop expected by economists. This follows a 4.5 percent drop in July. Investment lending edged up 0.1 percent. Data released by the Ministry of Finance showed that Japan's current account surplus came in at 2.0 trillion yen in August, more than the 1.5 trillion yen expected by economists and the 1.94 trillion-yen surplus in July. The trade surplus was also wider than expected at 243.2 billion yen, as exports fell 9.6 percent and imports declined a steeper 18.3 percent. Europe European stocks are holding up despite a volatile morning session. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has inched up by 0.1 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the German DAX Index are both up by 0.2 percent. On the economic front, German investor sentiment climbed at a faster-than-expected pace in October to its highest level in four months, the results of a survey by the Centre for European Economic Research/ZEW showed. The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment rose to 6.2 from 0.5 in each of the previous two months. Economists had expected a score of 4. The latest reading was the strongest since June's 19.2. Data released by the British Retail Consortium showed that like-for-like sales in the U.K. rose 0.4 percent year-over-year in September, belying expectations for a 0.3 percent drop. U.S. Economic Reports There are no market moving economic reports due for the day. Stocks in Focus Shares of Alcoa are moving lower in pre-market trading after the aluminum giant reported third quarter earnings and revenues that came in below analyst estimates. Rent-A-Center- (RCII) may also come under pressure after warning of much weaker than expected third quarter earnings. Illumina (ILMN) pre-announced third quarter revenues of about $607 million, a 10 percent increase year-over-year but below the company's guidance of $625 million to $630 million. The company attributed the shortfall to a larger than expected decline in high throughput sequencing instruments. Coca-Cola (KO) announced that it intends to buy Anheuser-Busch Inbev's (BUD) stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa following the closing of the ABI combination with SABMiller. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America These Companies Are Sitting On Mountains Of Cash Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Walt Disney Q4 Profit Down - Update Forget Canada: The Best Places To Escape Trump's America Continental Stock Dips On Weak Q3 Profit; Sees Strong Earnings In Q4 AstraZeneca Q3 Pre-tax Profit Down On Crestor Generic; Backs FY View Alphabet Cancels Drone Deal With Starbucks As Project Leaders Pushed Out Viacom Q4 Adj.

One of the main objectives to be pursued by the new body, which is called the Alliance for Inclusive & Multicultural Marketing (AIMM), involves building a "blueprint" for multicultural communications, according to the ANA. "Its goal is to bring together senior thought leaders from the African-American, Hispanic, Asian, LGBT and general-market communities to create a united blueprint for the evolution of multicultural and diverse-segment marketing in America," the industry organisation said in a statement. More specifically, AIMM will develop deep insights via collaborative research, communicate best practices, help formulate "unique marketplace experiences", focus on driving return on investment, and hold forums to share examples of success. Additionally, it intends to establish what the ANA described as "alternative and distinguished approaches" for tackling diversity issues across the industry. The slate of participating brand owners – beyond Coca-Cola, Anheuser-Busch and P&G – will include Dunkin' Donuts, Kaiser Permanente, Kellogg and Wells Fargo. "At Wells Fargo, we are about reinventing marketing, keeping our customer at the center of everything we do, and this directly aligns with the goal of AIMM," Michael Lacorazza, EVP/Brand & Advertising-Integrated Marketing at the financial services provider, and a Co-Chair of AIMM. "We look forward to working together to advance multicultural marketing as a fresh voice in the industry." Lacorazza's fellow Co-Chairs will be Antonio Lucio, Chief Marketing Officer at HP, and Bob Liodice, President/CEO of the ANA. "As the marketplace becomes increasingly diverse, the ANA recognises that the strategic evolution of multicultural marketing becomes even more important to brands," Liodice said. "Our strategic intent is to reach out to all constituencies in order to collectively make a difference in realising the potential of multicultural marketing." AIMM's membership will also feature the AHAA: The Voice of Hispanic Marketing, Burrell Communications, IW Group, López Negrete Communications, OMD and Target 10. They will be joined by NBCUniversal, Univision and the Video Advertising Bureau, with membership of AIMM being limited to an invitation-only basis for its first year of operation.

Paris brings a wealth of experience to the board at KonaRed, having spent a total of 12 years at POM Wonderful as a General Manager, VP and a four-month stint as Interim CFO/COO last year. He departed to join Harmless Harvest as COO in September, 2015, before leaving for his current position as COO of meal replacement company Soylent. “Brad Paris has substantial experience with market expansion, operations and the development and launch of new products,” Roberts said in a press release. “His advice and counsel to the board will be invaluable, and it is at a perfect time for us to add Brad to our team.” Redfield, also previously a General Manager (Industrial Sales) at POM Wonderful from 2011 through 2015, has served as President and COO at KonaRed since June 2015. “The appointment of Kyle Redfield as a director is a well deserved acknowledgement of the significant contribution he’s made to KonaRed in a short period of time, Roberts said. “Kyle’s been a driving force in our strategic initiatives and his participation as a director will further strengthen our Board.” KonaRed launched its RTD cold brew coffee line in January. Last month, KonaRed added two new SKUs — Kauai Caramel and Maui Mocha — and a 32 oz. glass bottle for Original and Hawaiian Vanilla flavors. The brand also announced a increase in retail placements and expanded distribution in August.

Olkiewicz arrives following over six years at Red Bull North America, where his roles included Director of Key Accounts (West), Head of Off Premise (Canada), Senior Director of National Accounts and most recently Vice President of National Accounts. Prior to joining Red Bull, Olkiewicz served as a Team Lead at Cadbury and an Account Executive at Procter & Gamble. “Craig has the vision, experience, and leadership acumen to strengthen our market position and capitalize on our many growth opportunities,” said Steve Dollase, CEO of WANU, in a press release. Jennifer Berliner, ZÜPA NOMA Jennifer Berliner Heads Up Marketing At ZÜPA NOMA Jennifer Berliner has joined high pressure processed bottled soup brand ZÜPA NOMA as director of marketing. Launched in June, ZÜPA NOMA is the first company under Sonoma Brands, the product incubator and venture fund founded by Jon Sebastiani, the founder and former CEO of Krave Pure Foods, Inc. Berlinger arrives from PepsiCo, where she most recently served as Senior Brand Manager for Shopper Marketing for LiptonTea, Hydration and Frito-Lay multipack snack lines. A Yale School of Management graduate, Berlinger had served several roles at Pepsi since 2012, including Brand Manager of Flavored CSDs and Associate Brand Manager for Foodservice Innovation. “Jennifer brings an arsenal of knowledge and experience to ZÜPA NOMA, and we know that she will contribute immensely to the exponential growth of the brand as a market leader in the category,” said Sebastiani in a press release. “Our investment in a Marketing division at ZÜPA NOMA, led by Jennifer, marks a valuable addition to our team as we continue to make an impact on the soup category with innovation and creativity.” More Moves at Veggemo Having recently brought on Frank Hood as VP of U.S. Business Development, the Global Gardens Group, owners of veggie-based non-dairy beverage brand Veggemo, announced the appointment of Paul Sun to its Board of Directors. A graduate of the Schulich School of Business, Sun has been a Board Advisor at Global Gardens Group since 2015. His previous experience includes a tenure as Managing Director of Institutional Sales and Managing Director of Mining Sales at Canadian investment banks Beacon Securities and Desjardins, respectively. “I am extremely pleased and excited to welcome Paul to our Board of Directors and the knowledge of Public Markets which he brings along with his general business acumen,” Rob Harrison, President and CEO, said in a press release. “He is a valued addition to our Board.” Latest News Data, Investment, and More!

Reprints Reprints Most Popular Intel has a new explanation for the famous scowling "Phelps face" from last summer's Olympics – inadequate processing power. That's the basis for a new series of ads pairing the world's fastest swimmer with the world's slowest computer, and with Jim Parsons of "Big Bang Theory" and Intel fame. Mr. Phelps' scowl was originally captured on camera as his rival Chad le Clos of South Africa warmed up by shadow boxing in an apparent effort to distract or intimidate him before August's 200-meter butterfly competition in Rio. Mr. Phelps won anyway, and the face became a social media meme. Intel hopes to ride some ripples from that #PhelpsFace wave in new ads from McGarryBowen breaking online this week and on TV Oct. 17 during "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" on CBS. The new ads back Intel's recently launched Seventh Gen procesor. The idea originally came during a different Olympic moment, said Intel Chief Marketing Officer Steven Fund, when Mr. Phelps was "watching himself swim, looking at the image through a very old computer. And we came up with the idea of the world's fastest swimmer on the world's slowest computer." Intel reached out to Mr. Phelps through his agent during the games, shot the ad and related social media content shortly thereafter, and, Mr. Fund said, "Got on air I think before anyone else has done anything with him post-Olympics." Mr. Phelps was already a fairly prolific endorser for, among others, Under Armour, Omega and 800razors.com (an online razor retailer he's also an investor in). Mr. Fund, himself a former global marketing director on Procter & Gamble Co.'s Gillette, saw him as a good fit for Intel as well. The message is basically the same one Mr. Parsons has been delivering: It's time to upgrade your computer. And Mr. Parsons has been so effective, Intel had no interest in walking away from him for the new ads either. With a PC processor market share of more than 87%, something that beats even his alma mater Gillette in razor blades, Intel's primary focus is growing the PC category rather than market share, Mr. Fund said. Over recent years, people have been waiting longer to replace old PCs, he said. "But actually this past year PCs have stabilized, and there was in fact just data published by IDC that shows PCs have grown for the first time year over year." Indeed, both IDC and Gartner data showed the North American PC market growing in the second quarter after five quarters of declines. "I'd like to say most of it is the marketing," Mr. Fund said. "The Parsons campaign is our best advertising ever. We test everything at Intel. It's got great breakthrough. It's very clear on message, and persuasion metrics are very strong." He declined to disclose spending, but said the new Phelps-Parsons effort will get significant weight both online and on TV. Intel's in-house Agency Inside has joined McGarryBowen in creating social content for the broader effort, with OMD handling media.

It's not too surprising that TV ratings for the second presidential debate on Sunday were 18 percent lower than ratings for the first debate. At 69 million viewers, TV ratings were still nearly a record high for a second presidential debate, even though the debate was up against Sunday night NFL football. However, Twitter TWTRreported a surge in the number of viewers and engagement in the second debate. Twitter’s live stream of the second debate reached 2.5 million unique viewers, up 30 percent from the first debate. Blogosphere "In slashing its outlook for third-quarter operating income from 7.8 trillion won to 5.2 trillion won," Tim Culpan writes about Samsung SSNLF, "executives have signaled their willingness to quickly recognize the massive scale and scope of the costs. Revenue will now be 47 trillion won instead of 49 trillion won." Not all stock market adages work to perfection. However, "Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur" has worked out nicely in 2016.

Published on October 12, 2016. Magna has revised its U.S. ad spending forecast upward. Credit: Magna Most Popular Magna expects 2016 to see the largest increase in United States ad spending in six years. The IPG Mediabrands' agency revised its forecast for the year on Wednesday, predicting ad revenue in the U.S. will grow to $179 billion, a 6.3% increase. In June, Magna had predicted a 6.2% jump in ad revenue. A 6.3% jump would represent the strongest growth rate since 2010, when revenue increased 6.6%. Excluding incremental ad sales generated by the 2016 presidential election and the Summer Olympics, ad growth would be 4.4%, in line with last year's growth of 4.3%. The revised forecast comes following a stronger-than-expected first-half of the year, with ad revenue climbing nearly 7%. The first quarter actually saw the strongest year-over-year growth rate recorded in over a decade. Ad sales were driven by a 4.6% jump in national TV, 18.3% surge in digital media and 3.8% growth in out-of-home. Print and radio advertising continued to decline 9% and 2%, respectively. While some advertisers such as Procter & Gamble have publicly said that their digital media investments have proved disappointing and they are re-allocating dollars back to TV, Magna said overall advertisers did not reduce their digital advertising in the first half of the year. Instead they increased spending on both digital and national TV advertising at the expense of print and radio. Overall ad growth is expected to slow in 2017 due to a lack of tentpole events, with Magna expecting a much more modest 1.4% increase for the year. Still, Magna predicted that underlying demand will remain strong. For the first time ever, digital advertising this year will equal TV ad sales, with both generating about $68 billion, according to Magna. Growing at 44%, social media advertising is the biggest contributing factor in digital advertising equaling TV ad sales. By the end of the decade, digital ad sales is expected to reach $105 billion. ~ ~ ~ CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story stated that The IPG Mediabrands' agency revised its forecast for the year, predicting ad revenue in the U.S. will grow to $179 billion, a 6.5% increase. It is a 6.3% increase.

Photo / Getty Images The pay of executives of a company, whether in salary, bonuses or other types of remuneration, is usually justified as an incentive to improve the financial performance of a company. This has led to ever more complex performance packages with increasing percentage of variable, performance-based payments. But what is increasingly evident is that this definition of a role of an executive needs to change, as do the incentives, to act not only in the best financial interests of the company but to focus on how it serves the wider community. How executive pay changed for the worst Executives payments are in the spotlight in Australia and overseas, yet again as companies report this information. As the market for top executives is global, there is a limited talent pool. In essence, if an Australian company is not prepared to pay the going rate, the talent will go elsewhere in the world to where a company is prepared to pay. The design of executive pay in Australia has undergone significant change since the mid 1990s, when executive pay began to pick up. A smaller percentage of an Australian executive's reward package was subject to performance incentives 20 years ago. A majority were on fixed pay or with short-term bonuses payable when they reached a specific measurable target. Today, the variable component of executive pay is much higher. Continued below. Related Content NZ's biggest leaky building case begins Chris Rattue: Give Aaron Smith a disability lesson Unhappy workplaces look a lot like unhappy marriages, new research shows Findings from a survey on executive remuneration by the Australian Human Resource Institute shows that within Australia, executive pay is typically comprised of three components: fixed remuneration and short and long-term incentives. This three-part structure is endorsed by the human resource profession as it acknowledges not only the skill and experience an executive brings to a role (fixed remuneration) but the effort an individual executive makes to change performance and culture leading to better financial performance (short-term incentive) and improvement to shareholder returns (long-term incentives). However, an increasing number of studies show these type of performance schemes do not lead to better organisational performance and actually have dangerous outcomes. This is because it incentivises executives' risk-taking and short-term orientation and can lead to disastrous outcomes, such as the Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers collapses. A 2003 Australian study shows that performance-based executive remuneration has not lead to increased performance by Australian companies. Current executive remuneration focuses heavily on short-term financial performance ignoring other success factors, such as customer satisfaction. For example, Commonwealth Bank CEO Ian Narev is one of the highest paid executives in Australia in 2016 despite a series of recent scandals that shook the bank. Another distortion created by finance based incentives is the temporary effects of executive payment packages. BHP CEO Andrew Mackenzie's pay was halved due to the company's loss and he was left to deal with decisions made by his predecessor. The former CEO, Marius Kloppers, walked away with a sizeable pay package in large part due to his term coinciding with very favourable economic conditions for mining and the fact that he could vest both his short and long-term incentives before leaving. These limitations of current performance-based payment schemes have led to the proposal of payment packages that enable executives to sell only a fraction of shares awarded to them each year. This includes a specified number of years after retirement, combined with limitations on unwinding. Such schemes still reward executives for improving companies' performance but do not lead to short-term thinking and risk-taking. Unfortunately, changes to performance payment schemes are still rare. The alternatives While some companies in the US have started to bind performance payments to long-term results, such as Goldman Sachs, Procter & Gamble and Morgan Stanley, companies in Australia still haven't followed suit. One Australian organisation that has made changes to address the above challenges in executives' remuneration is fund management agency the Future Fund. There are more radical suggestions such as completely abolishing pay-for-performance. The suggestion to abolish performance payment is aligned with the concept of stewardship. Stewardship is about placing others' long-term interests ahead of personal goals that serve an individual's self interests. According to stewardship theory, executives are custodians of their organisations and are intrinsically motivated to contribute to their welfare and prosperity. It's their personal beliefs and intrinsic motivation that drives their performance, not performance-based payments. Revising performance structures is just one measure to increase stewardship among executives. Stewardship is based on fundamentally different assumptions about human nature than financial performance incentives. It emphasises the social orientation and profession-like behaviour of managers. However you can't rely on human nature alone, other measures are needed to change the institutional context in which businesses operate. These include changing the laws to reflect that the role of business in society goes beyond financial performance. Another measure is changing business education to cultivate future business leaders in moral judgement and accountabilities. The recruiting process can also change to select candidates with demonstrated long-term orientation and care for all stakeholders, rather than based on the current focus on past financial performance. Another measure is introducing external remuneration committees with employee representation and excluding current directors. Such changes to the institutional context require a significant rethink of current business and economic practices and government policies. Despite calls for such changes in Australia and overseas, there is little we can be optimistic about at the moment. This article was originally published on The Conversation.

She was 70. She was Mumbai's original queen bee and will be fondly remembered by many as a style icon in her signature beret, who hosted some of Mumbai's most memorable evenings peppered with a globally eclectic guest list - including businesspersons, Hollywood actors and beautiful people - with an ease which no one has since been able to match. Godrej used her position and natural charm to champion many social causes. She campaigned for AIDS at a time when people were still embarrassed to talk about it. One of her biggest initiatives in philanthropy was joining hands with actor Richard Gere, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative to combat AIDS through the launch of the 'Heroes Project' in 2004. She is remembered for her public persona as much as she is for being a devoted wife, mother and friend with a warm heart. The daughter of an army officer, Parmeshwar was 17 when she met Adi Godrej, who was 21. She was then working as an air hostess with Air India. They married in 1965, and had three children -- daughters Tanya Dubash and Nisa Godrej who are associated with the flagship company Godrej Consumer Products, and son Pirojsha who leads the group's listed realty arm. In the second volume of his book 'Godrej - A hundred years', BK Karanjia wrote: "One cannot think of Adi Godrej without thinking of Parmeshwar Godrej. The other way round, too. It isn't only that together they are often in the news, doing the social round. Their complementariness is a way of life with them. Each freely acknowledges what is owed to the other." Adi Godrej, who recently described Parmeshwar as a "strong woman", gained immensely from her extroverted personality. She helped her introvert husband to become a leader of excellence by coaching him in art, culture and the finer things of life, according to the book. Harsh Goenka, chairman, RPG Enterprises, reveals that he acquired his taste for art from Parmeshwar Godrej. "She was a true diva with various facets. The one facet I came closest to was her strong sense of design. She helped design my home and office. That's when we developed our friendship of 30 years. She gave me my passion for art. She exuded natural warmth. 'Socialite', in that sense, is a wrong term to use for her," Goenka told TOI. She is remembered by many as one whose ideas were ahead of her time. She set up a series of businesses, all of which were successful in their own right. She also contributed to the family business of soaps and toiletries by offering her astute marketing ideas. In the book, Adi Godrej has been quoted as saying: "Our best advertising was due to her (Parmeshwar)". The campaign to revive Cinthol after Godrej split with American multinational, Procter & Gamble, was an example of that. Hoshedar Press, former vice chairman, Godrej Consumer Products, recalls how Parmeshwar Godrej was instrumental in roping in Imran Khan and Vinod Khanna, her close friends, to endorse Cinthol, a relatively small brand compared to the rivals. It added immense value to the brand and its image, he said. As an interior designer, she refashioned the homes of the wealthy in Mumbai, Delhi and London as well as several iconic restaurants, including Khyber and China Garden. Godrej had also designed clothes for actress Hema Malini on the insistence of director friend Feroze Khan for the film Dharmatma in 1975. She had teamed up with director Shekhar Kapur to launch a production house called Starlight in 2000, which was preceded by co-producing the Merchant-Ivory production 'The Perfect Murder' in 1988. Given her own wide range of interests, her network of friends were from diverse fields. In a recent book, Nobel laureate Amartya Sen had spoken richly about her, calling her a "brilliant conversationalist" and "wonderful company". As word spread about her death, social media was filled with rich tributes to her and her passion. Salman Rushdie wrote, "A dear and unfailingly generous friend and a tireless fighter against the spread of HIV/AIDS in India. A wonderful woman and a force of nature." Author Shobhaa De said, "She did raise the bar for how India entertained but there was much more to her than her exaggerated glam public persona." Businessperson Nina Pillai said, "She had that big Punjabi heart and her laughter was one that came from her soul." She was cremated, according to her family.

kits distributed News provided by American Red Cross Oct 11, 2016, 15:51 ET Share this article WASHINGTON, Oct. 11, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The American Red Cross is on the ground providing safe shelter, food and relief supplies to help people still suffering from Hurricane Matthew's lingering effects. The storm also continues to impact blood collections in the southeast, resulting in an urgent need for blood and platelet donations across the country. Continue Reading In the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, three women join together to roll up a sleeve at an American Red Cross blood drive in Minnesota to help patients in need. The Red Cross has a national blood inventory and can move blood products wherever they are needed including storm affected areas in the Southeast where dozens of blood drives have been cancelled. Supplies are delivered to the Haitian Red Cross in response to Hurricane Matthew. “You just gotta be strong,” Terry’s story from a Red Cross Shelter "Our hearts go out to everyone affected by this devastating storm both in the Southeast and across the Caribbean. Too many lives have tragically been cut short, and tens of thousands of people have been displaced," said Gail McGovern, president and chief executive officer of the Red Cross. "The Red Cross is working closely with the entire response community to provide safe shelter, water, food and essential relief supplies to affected individuals and families," McGovern continued. "Flooding and damage from the storm are also hurting our ability to collect blood and platelets in impacted areas – and the need for platelet donations is particularly critical right now. It's important to remember that trauma victims, surgery patients, those with cancer and many others count on lifesaving blood and platelet donations each and every day." HOW TO HELP MAKE A DONATION The Red Cross depends on donations to provide immediate relief. Help people affected by Hurricane Matthew by visiting redcross.org, calling 1-800-RED CROSS or texting the word MATTHEW to 90999 to make a $10 donation. Donations enable the Red Cross to prepare for, respond to and help people recover from this disaster. Learn more about the Red Cross response to Hurricane Matthew here. GIVE BLOOD, PLATELETS In parts of the country unaffected by the storm, the Red Cross needs eligible individuals to please give blood or platelets now to help ensure we have a readily available blood supply for patients in need. Appointments can be made by using the Red Cross Blood Donor App, visiting redcrossblood.org or calling 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767). DISASTER RESPONSE ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST To help people affected by Hurricane Matthew, the Red Cross has launched a widespread sheltering effort spanning four states and providing as many overnight stays in shelters as after Superstorm Sandy. Nearly 4,800 people in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida woke up Tuesday morning in 90 Red Cross and community shelters. Since Hurricane Matthew first threatened the U.S., Red Cross and community partners have served more than 137,000 meals and snacks, and provided 74,000 overnight stays. The Red Cross has mobilized 3,000 disaster workers, 155 emergency response vehicles—nearly half of our fleet—and more than 100 trailers filled with water, ready-to-eat meals, cots, blankets, kitchen items, cleaning supplies, insect repellant, gloves, masks, shovels, rakes, coolers and more. More volunteers, vehicles and supplies are being mobilized now to supplement relief efforts. The Red Cross is also working in close collaboration with government officials and community partners to coordinate response efforts to ensure people receive the help they need as quickly as possible. FLOODING FORCES MORE BLOOD DRIVE CANCELLATIONS The Red Cross is struggling to collect much-needed blood and platelet donations as floodwaters inundate communities in the Southeast. In Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, Hurricane Matthew has forced the cancellation of more than 75 Red Cross blood drives, resulting in nearly 2,500 blood and platelet donations going uncollected. The need for platelets is especially critical due to the loss of these donations in affected areas. Platelets are a key clotting component of blood often needed by cancer patients that must be transfused within five days of donation. Platelet donors can roll up a sleeve every seven days, up to 24 times year. With additional blood drive cancellations likely due to significant flooding and power outages, the Red Cross urgently needs blood and platelet donations and asks individuals to make an appointment to give now. HAITI RESPONSE In Haiti, more than 200 American Red Cross staff—about 80 percent of whom are Haitian nationals—are helping to distribute immediate relief supplies to the more than 61,000 displaced residents. To address the increasing threat of cholera, the American Red Cross will target cholera-prevention kits to medical facilities. Given the extent of the damage and the continued difficultly in reaching several of the affected areas, the American Red Cross is also playing a key coordination role with local authorities and international humanitarian organizations to ensure life-saving support and supplies reach all those in need as soon as possible. Generators and telecommunications equipment to augment our support capabilities arrived in Haiti on October 8; additional relief supplies, such as water purification products, shelter kits, and mosquito nets are being procured locally and internationally.

Related Stories How Meat Science (And Marketing) Gave the World the Flat Iron Steak Why Making a Better Umbrella Is Way Harder Than It Seems The Screw Heads That Tried, But Failed, to Topple Phillips A pool of anti freeze, which contains the chemical bitrex. (Photo: ms.akr/CC BY 2.0) A version of this post originally appeared on Tedium, a twice-weekly newsletter that hunts for the end of the long tail. We love things that taste good. We hate things that taste bad. Perhaps it’s for that reason we don’t spend a lot of time talking about terrible-tasting things. Generally, when we do, it involves encounters like Anthony Bourdain’s taste of the Icelandic delicacy hákarl, or fermented shark. (Iceland is Not Impressed by this attempt. In a Reykjavik Grapevine piece last year, former food editor Ragnar Egilsson mocked Bourdain’s complaints. “Celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain famously called ‘hákarl’ the worst thing he had ever eaten,” Egilsson wrote. “This may have been coloured by an overall miserable visit to Iceland or by the fact that Anthony Bourdain is a huge sissy.”) But, getting past the stunt food, there’s plenty of reason that we should talk about terrible tastes. The biggest is this: Sometimes, hiding in that terrible taste might be something so important that it can change the world in a noticeable way. In fact, there’s a really terrible flavor that’s hiding all over your home. Why haven’t you tasted it yet? Well, let’s just say that, if the flavor does its job right, you never will. In 2007, Aqua Dots, a toy manufacturer, had a bit of a disaster on its hands when it was discovered that at least some of the beaded toys it produced were coated with a chemical so dangerous that, when it metabolized, it turned into the “date-rape” drug GHB. Beads are small, and they’re edible. So you can imagine what happened. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission quickly recalled more than 4.2 million toys in an effort to control the problem. But eventually, these toys came back on the market in a different form, under a different name. And when they did, they were covered with another kind of chemical—this one designed to prevent kids from eating the beads. Aqua Dots, a toy that was recalled after the manufacturer discovered that parts were coated with a chemical that, when ingested, metabolizes to the “date rape” drug GHB.  (Photo: Anathea Utley/CC BY 2.0) That chemical, denatonium benzoate, goes by the brand name Bitrex, and it’s been around since the 1950s. It’s currently used in substances as diverse as antifreeze, perfumes, household cleaners, and pesticides. Only recently has the chemical come to the world of toys. But it packs a hell of a punch—a single molecule of Bitrex can make a million molecules of water taste horrible. If that level of bitterness sounds like fodder for a series of YouTube-style challenges, YouTube is already way ahead of you. Here’s a G-rated taste-test from a radio-station morning show crew that was put up to it by a nonprofit organization; here’s an R-rated test from a guy who runs a YouTube channel dedicated to eating weird things. But as we learned in the case of Aqua Dots, this material has some important uses. One of those was discovered by the U.S. Army, which filed a patent describing “compositions and method for degrading foodstuffs.” Other methods for turning the enemy’s food into untouchable junk were highlighted in the patent, but none were quite as memorable as Bitrex. “This compound is several magnitudes more bitter, and the bitter taste persists in the mouth for a considerable time,” the patent stated. “Rice which is contaminated with this chemical in amounts of 0.10 pound per ton is inedible. The bitter taste was so nauseating that no one who tasted the boiled rice was able to consume as much as a teaspoonful.” The incredibly potent flavoring of Bitrex didn’t have a ton of uses at first, but eventually, it proved handy for a problem that arose in the early ’80s, when reports of children being hospitalized for accidentally ingesting household chemicals became commonplace. The logic is simple. If you make dangerous chemicals taste bad, kids won’t eat or drink them. As New Scientist explained in a 1985 article: The sensible answer, then, is to make these household chemicals taste so repellant to a child that its immediate reaction if it puts some in its mouth is to spit it out. What is required is a compound so vile in taste that it cannot be tolerated. There are, in fact, several such substances, both natural and man-made, but one that stands out above all others is denatonium benzoate, or Bitrex, as it is commonly known. This white, non-toxic powder, which is soluble in both aqueous and organic solvents, is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the bitterest substance known. Adding just one teaspoon of powder to a tankerful of water would make the water undrinkable. Problem was, it wasn’t a given that household cleaner manufacturers would use this substance, particularly in the U.S. That’s where the hard work of an Albany, Oregon, woman named Lynn Tylczak came into play. Tylczak heard about Bitrex getting used in cleaners made in Europe, but found out that the issue was getting ignored in the U.S. In the 1980s, well before the days of email, she started a letter-writing campaign—first with chemical manufacturers, then with politicians, neither of which she had much luck with. She had a much better track record, however, when she and 20 of her neighbors started reaching out to the media and various consumer groups about the problem. Bitrex is added to household cleaners so that they taste bad. (Photo: Mike Mozart/CC BY 2.0) “I wrote to about 20 of the big newspapers, then I wrote to consumer groups, magazines, health magazines, insurance magazines, the people I thought would pick it up,” Tylczak told the Los Angeles Times in 1989. The media notice worked; soon, the politicians (including New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, then a member of the House) were knocking on her door pledging support. Noted consumer advocates, like Ralph Nader, were singing Tylczak’s praises, and the National Safety Council quickly called on manufacturers to add Bitrex to their products. As it turned out, at least one company, Procter & Gamble, already had. After doing market research in the early ’80s, the company added the chemical to two varieties of laundry detergent after it was found that children were more susceptible to drinking those kinds of detergents over others. But its comments highlighted the fact that resistance lingered. ”We don’t advertise the use of Bitrex because we don’t want to communicate the notion that our products are not safe if they don’t have Bitrex,” company spokeswoman Jennifer G. Bailey told The New York Times. ”All of our products contain an emetic that would induce vomiting.” Procter & Gamble was nothing compared to the antifreeze industry, which apparently got a PR firm to spy on her operation, according to a Covert Action Quarterlyreport. Bottles of anti-freeze. (Photo: Anthony Easton/CC BY 2.0) She recalled in comments to The Giraffe Project: “One major antifreeze manufacturer saw the Poison-Proof Project on CNN and decided to use bittering agents. His comment was, ‘It would cost us more to fight this than to do it.’ Doesn’t anybody just plain want to make a safe product?” Within a year and a half, the success of Tylczak’s grassroots efforts were bearing fruit—she quickly became a fixture on television talk shows, her efforts had gotten notice in Congress, and the industry started changing its ways. And in 1995, a law requiring antifreeze to contain the chemical was passed in Oregon. These days, Bitrex is commonly used in all sorts of products you shouldn’t drink. So if you accidentally have a toxic chemical in front of you and you feel like taking a swig, you can thank Lynn Tylczak for ensuring that you spit it out almost immediately. (Not that you should even try to drink a toxic chemical. That’s stupid.) Bitrex’s discovery may have a bit of accident, but the world of chemical production doesn’t have a monopoly on terrible-tasting things. And, as any foodie knows, “bitter” doesn’t necessarily mean “terrible.” Author and chef Jennifer McLagan, for example, wrote an entire cookbook playing up the appeal of bitter foods. In an interview with Publishers Weekly, she emphasized that the decline of human taste buds actually does adults a favor. “As we age, we don’t have as many taste buds, and we can get used to bitter flavors,” she explained. “As we experience more bitter flavors, we are more likely to crave and appreciate the digestive powers of bitter, which can, for example, balance fatty foods.” In other words, bitter is an acquired taste. Consider, as well, durian, an incredibly smelly fruit that some people either love or hate. One food writer, Richard Sterling, describes the smell as “turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock. It can be smelled from yards away.” Smithsonian magazine, in a piece on the bizarre fruit, says that scientists have analyzed that smell, in an attempt to nail down why it’s so pungent, and have found a situation unlike that with Bitrex. It’s not a single chemical compound—but numerous ones, each evoking different kinds of smells. At least 50 different ones, many of them things you wouldn’t want to smell individually, let alone mashed into one super-smell. If you truly wanted to mess with someone, obviously, you would put Bitrex on a durian. Sounds like an endurance test I’d watch on YouTube.

Oct 11, 2016, 15:10 ET Share this article DUBLIN, October 11, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Global Female Depilatory Products Market 2016-2020" report to their offering. The report forecasts the global female depilatory products market to grow at a CAGR of 6.04% during the period 2016-2020. One of the key trends for market growth will be the rise in number of private labels and niche brands and smaller manufacturers. The number of private label brands in the global female depilatory products market is increasing, creating competition for global and regional vendors. Private labels such as Chatters are present in the market; over time, there has also been a rise in the quality of the products offered by these labels. The private label brands contributed more than 5% of global grooming market revenue in 2015. Some of these niche branded players are Conair, Revitol, and Jolen. Some smaller players that are getting market presence in developing markets such as India include Dabur and Vi-John. The brands for depilatory products of these marketers include Fem from Dabur and Feather Touch from Vi-John. According to the report, consumer emphasis on personal grooming and hygiene will be a key driver for market growth. Increasing emphasis on personal hygiene and grooming is likely to drive the market for depilatory products over the forecast period. In the US, a woman spends an average of $45 per month on beauty products. The Hispanics form a major part of the beauty industry. In 2015, this population segment spent over 3% more on shaving products than it did in 2014. Similarly, spending by this group on personal care products increased by over 4% from that of 2014. In key developing markets like India, demand for personal care products has grown during the period 2010-2015. Further, the report states that increasing demand for laser hair removal will be a major challenge for the market. The growing demand for alternative solutions such as laser technology will have considerable negative effects on the sales of depilatory products. In December 2006, the US FDA approved the first at-home laser hair remover developed by P&G's Gillette and Palomar Medical Technologies. Other manufacturers have also launched similar products. More consumers are opting for these products, as laser hair removal offer long-term hair removal. This is threatening the sales of traditional depilatories.

(Photo: Andrew Selsky / AP) A nationwide prison work stoppage and hunger strike, begun on Sept. 9, the 45th anniversary of the Attica uprising, have seen over 20,000 prisoners in about 30 prisons do what we on the outside should do—refuse to cooperate. “We will not only demand the end to prison slavery, we will end it ourselves by ceasing to be slaves,” prisoners of the Free Alabama Movement, the Free Ohio Movement and the IWW Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee wrote in a communique. This round of prison strikes—there will be more—has had little outside support and press coverage. There have been few protests outside prison walls. Prison authorities—unlike during the 1971 Attica uprising when the press was allowed into the yard to interview the rebellious prisoners—have shut out a compliant media. They have identified strike leaders and placed them in isolation. Whole prisons in states such as Texas were put on lockdown on the eve of the strike. It is hard to know how many prisoners are still on strike, just as it is hard to know how many stopped work or started to fast on Sept. 9. Before the strike I was able to speak to prisoner leaders including Melvin Ray, James Pleasant and Robert Earl Council, all of whom led work stoppages in Alabama prisons in January 2014 as part of the Free Alabama Movement, as well as Siddique Hasan, one of five leaders of the April 1993 uprising at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility at Lucasville, Ohio. (The Ohio revolt saw prisoners take control of the facility for 11 days after numerous grievances, including complaints about deaths allegedly caused by beatings from guards, went unanswered.) Now, authorities have cut off the access of these and other prisoner leaders to the press and the rest of the outside world. I have not been able to communicate with the four men since the strike began. These prison strike leaders put no hope in a “national conversation” about race and mass incarceration. They know that corporations, the courts and politicians will never halt the lethal police violence against unarmed men and women of color or dismantle the vast gulags for the poor that dot the country. The mechanisms of repression are by design. They are the logical consequence of deindustrialization. The corporate state uses fear, police violence and huge networks of jails and prisons to keep hundreds of millions of underemployed and unemployed poor people from revolting. “We have to shut down the prisons,” Council, known as Kinetik, one of the founders of the Free Alabama Movement, told me by phone from the Holman Correctional Facility in Escambia County, Ala. He has been in prison 21 years, serving a sentence of life without parole. “We will not work for free anymore. All the work in prisons, from cleaning to cutting grass to working in the kitchen, is done by inmate labor. [Almost no prisoner] in Alabama is paid. Without us the prisons, which are slave empires, cannot function. Prisons, at the same time, charge us a variety of fees, such as for our identification cards or wrist bracelets, and [impose] numerous fines, especially for possession of contraband. They charge us high phone and commissary prices. Prisons each year are taking larger and larger sums of money from the inmates and their families. The state gets from us millions of dollars in free labor and then imposes fees and fines. You have brothers that work in kitchens 12 to 15 hours a day and have done this for years and have never been paid.” These strike leaders say that, inside and outside the prison walls, rebellion is the only option. “We are not going to call for protests outside of statehouses,” Ray said. “Legislators are owned by corporations. To go up there with the achy-breaky heart is not going to do any good. These politicians are in it for the money. If you are fighting mass incarceration, the people who are incarcerated are not in the statehouse. They are not in the parks. They are in the prisons. If you are going to fight for the people in prison, join them at the prison. The kryptonite to fight the prison system, which is a $500 billion enterprise, is the work strike. And we need people to come to the prisons to let guys on the inside know they have outside support to shut the prison down. Once we take our labor back, prisons will again become places for correction and rehabilitation rather than centers of corporate profit.” These striking prisoners are far more effective, and far more threatening to the corporate state, than the outside multitudes entranced and manipulated by the Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Goon Show. Denied the right to employment, to vote and to public assistance because of felony convictions, denied the right to justice because they are poor, and denied a voice because they have been silenced by state censorship and a bankrupt media, these prisoners were some of the first to understand the totalitarian nature of the corporate state. “We do not believe in the political process,” said Ray, who spoke from the St. Clair Correctional Facility in Springville, Ala., and who is serving life without parole. “We are not looking to politicians to submit reform bills. We aren’t giving more money to lawyers. We don’t believe in the courts. We will rely only on protests inside and outside of prisons and on targeting the corporations that exploit prison labor and finance the school-to-prison pipeline.” The 2.3 million human beings, most of them poor people of color, who are locked in cages across the country provide billions in salaries and other revenues for depressed rural towns with large prisons. They provide billions more in profits to phone card companies, money transfer companies, food service companies, merchandise vendors, construction companies, laundry services, uniform companies, prison equipment vendors and the manufacturers of pepper spray, body armor and the many other medieval instruments used for the physical restraint of prisoners. They also make billions for corporations—Whole Foods, Verizon, Starbucks, McDonald’s, Sprint, Victoria’s Secret, American Airlines, J.C. Penney, Sears, Wal-Mart, Kmart, Eddie Bauer, Wendy’s, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Fruit of the Loom, Motorola, Caterpillar and dozens of others—that collectively exploit 1 million prison laborers. Why pay workers outside the walls the minimum wage when you can pay workers behind walls only a couple of dollars a day? Why exploit sweatshop workers in countries like Bangladesh when you can exploit sweatshop workers in U.S. prisons? Why permit prison reform that would impede profits? Why not expand a system that reduces labor costs to slave wages? “The beauty of a work stoppage is that the prison administrators have to bring in compensated labor,” Hasan told me last year when I visited him on death row in Ohio. “This is what happened in the Georgia prison system in 2010 when the prisoners held a work stoppage for six days. It cost the state a lot of money.” Prisoners are the ideal workers in corporate America. They earn from 8 cents to about 44 cents an hour. In some states, such as Alabama, they earn nothing. They receive no Social Security, pensions or other benefits. They do not get paid overtime. They are prohibited from organizing or carrying out strikes. They always show up on time. They are not paid for sick days or granted vacations. They cannot complain about poor working conditions or safety hazards. If they protest their meager wages or working conditions they instantly lose their jobs and are placed in isolation cells. They live in an environment where they daily face the possibility of torture, beatings, prolonged isolation, sensory deprivation, racial profiling, rancid food, inadequate medical care, little or no heating and ventilation, and rape. I In short, they are slaves. The bondage that prisoners endure is, little by little, being imposed on us. The fight inside prison walls is our own. And the harsh repression inside prisons to halt the new strike mirrors the harsh repression that awaits us if we resist. Kevin “Rashid” Johnson, the minister of defense of the New Afrikan Black Panther Party (Prison Chapter), sent this message out of his Texas prison a few days ago: Monday, September 5, 2016: Labor Day. Here at the William P. Clements Unit, a prison in remote Amarillo, Texas, the prisoners awoke to a late breakfast. A single PBJ sandwich, a small bowl of dry cereal, and no beverage. This grossly inadequate meal, which is our common fare during institution-wide lockdowns, signaled that a weeks—or months—long lockdown was in effect. Hunger pangs set in almost immediately. Such lockdowns are routinely imposed twice yearly so guards can conduct a prison-wide search of each prisoner’s living area and property. But this was not a routine lockdown. For one, those lockdowns almost never occur during holidays (however minor). If a holiday is set to fall during the period of a scheduled lockdown, the lockdown is postponed until the day after the holiday. Secondly, those lockdowns happen exactly six months apart, almost to the day. The next one wasn’t due until mid-October, making this lockdown over a month ahead of schedule. Thirdly, for a couple months preceding this lockdown, officials had been rejecting a lot of mail and media on grounds that it contained information on or “advocating” “prison strikes,” “prison disruption,” or “work strikes.” During late August and early September I received a number of these rejections, including for letters from the editor of the San Francisco Bay View newspaper, Comrades from the Houston, TX branch of the Industrial Workers of the World, and others. Officials were also illegally opening and reading privileged legal and media mail outside my presence. They were obviously focused on discovering, scrutinizing, and blocking any information coming into the prison about the work stoppage/strike planned for prisons across the U.S. in protest of prison slave labor and perpetual abuses, which were set to begin on September 9, 2016—the 45th anniversary of the uprising at Attica State Prison, that exposed to the world the inhumanity and savage brutality that Amerika imposes on those it imprisons. And here we find the clue to this untimely lockdown which officials here have been falsely portraying to us as just another routine lockdown. The actual aim of this lockdown was/is to pre-empt the prisoners at this Unit from participating in the September 9th protest by confining everyone to their cells in advance of it, and well into the period during which it might last. Johnson and other prison strike leaders see through the political theater and illusions that the corporate elites employ to mask Americans’ surrender of freedom. They are not fooled by the clever branding—including the presidency of a black man and possibly the presidency of a woman—used to cover over oppression. “To say that we have a black president does not say anything,” Melvin Ray said. “The politicians are the ones who orchestrated this system. They are either directly involved as businessmen—many are already millionaires or billionaires, or they are controlled by millionaires and billionaires. We are not blindsided by titles. We are looking at what is going on behind the scenes. We see a coordinated effort by the Koch brothers, ALEC [the American Legislative Exchange Council] and political action committees that see in prisons a business opportunity. Their goal is to increase [corporate] earnings. And once you look at it like this, it does not matter if we have a black or white president. That is why the policies have not changed. The laws, such as mandatory minimum [sentences], were put in place by big business so they would have access to cheap labor. The anti-terrorism laws were enacted to close the doors on the access to justice so people would be in prison longer. Big business finances campaigns. Big business writes the laws and legislation. And Obama takes money from these people. He is as vested in this system as they are.” Items once provided to prisoners, such as shoes, extra blankets and toilet paper, now often must be bought from the prison commissary, run by corporations such as Keefe Supply Co. These commissaries are, in effect, company stores where prices are exorbitant and the buyers are hostage. Companies such as GTL force prisoners to pay phone rates five or six times higher than those on the outside. JPay, a money transfer service for prisoners, imposes fees as high as 25 percent. The incarcerated are increasingly being charged for electricity and room and board. This bleeds the prisoners and their families of the little income they possess. Those who run out of money are forced to take out prison loans to buy medications, cover legal and medical fees and purchase commissary items such as soap and deodorant. Debt peonage is as common among prisoners as it is among the wider public. And when prisoners are released they often owe the state thousands of dollars in debt they incurred while locked up. When they can’t pay it back they are tossed back into prison. The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that 75 percent of released prisoners are rearrested within five years. This keeps the perpetual cycle of neoslavery lubricated. “For years we were called niggers to indicate we had no value or worth and that anything could be done to us,” Ray told me. “Then the word ‘nigger’ became politically incorrect. So they began calling us criminals. When you say a person is a criminal it means that what happens to them does not matter. It means he or she is a nigger. It means they deserve what they get.” © 2016 TruthDig Chris Hedges Chris Hedges writes a regular column for Truthdig.com.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel Just Buy Live, an online distributor that connects mom-and-pop retailers to consumer brands, aims to become profitable by next fiscal as it focuses on expanding its presence to more states including Gujarat and Kerala. "We are spending on infrastructure building and onboarding retailers but we are not burning cash. We are focusing on becoming profitable in each centre that we operate in," Just Buy Live Chairman and CEO Sahil Sani told PTI. Also, because the company is not in the race to discount and get customers, it would hit profitability faster, he added.

"We are now looking at expanding our model to states like Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan by the end of the fiscal," he said. Unlike e-commerce companies, Just Buy Live uses the digital platform to connect brands with offline retailers. It has on board brands like Xiaomi, Samsung, Micromax, YU Mobiles, Oppo, Patanjali, ITC , P&G, Unilever, Coca Cola, Pepsico, Amul and Nestle . "We aren't fighting with e-commerce companies for customers. Our competition is distributors. We are aggregated suppliers of various brands and with value propositions for retailers like exclusive launches, we have seen phenomenal growth, 30 per cent month-on-month growth," he said. Established in 2015, the company launched commercial operations in January this year. It claims to have 60,000 retailers on its platform. With an average order value of Rs 17,500 on its platform, it is confident of hitting profitability within its targeted period. It aims to have 10,000 brands and one million products on offer reaching out to a million retailers by the end of 2016.

The report forecasts the global female depilatory products market to grow at a CAGR of 6.04% during the period 2016-2020. One of the key trends for market growth will be the rise in number of private labels and niche brands and smaller manufacturers. The number of private label brands in the global female depilatory products market is increasing, creating competition for global and regional vendors. Private labels such as Chatters are present in the market; over time, there has also been a rise in the quality of the products offered by these labels. The private label brands contributed more than 5% of global grooming market revenue in 2015. Some of these niche branded players are Conair, Revitol, and Jolen. Some smaller players that are getting market presence in developing markets such as India include Dabur and Vi-John. The brands for depilatory products of these marketers include Fem from Dabur and Feather Touch from Vi-John. According to the report, consumer emphasis on personal grooming and hygiene will be a key driver for market growth. Increasing emphasis on personal hygiene and grooming is likely to drive the market for depilatory products over the forecast period. In the US, a woman spends an average of $45 per month on beauty products. The Hispanics form a major part of the beauty industry. In 2015, this population segment spent over 3% more on shaving products than it did in 2014. Similarly, spending by this group on personal care products increased by over 4% from that of 2014. In key developing markets like India, demand for personal care products has grown during the period 2010-2015. Further, the report states that increasing demand for laser hair removal will be a major challenge for the market. The growing demand for alternative solutions such as laser technology will have considerable negative effects on the sales of depilatory products. In December 2006, the US FDA approved the first at-home laser hair remover developed by P&G's Gillette and Palomar Medical Technologies. Other manufacturers have also launched similar products. More consumers are opting for these products, as laser hair removal offer long-term hair removal. This is threatening the sales of traditional depilatories.
