The 3 Best Dividend Stocks for Beginning Investors The Motley Fool 11/7/2016 Jason Hall, Dan Caplinger, and Neha Chamaria © Provided by Fool Dividend Stocks Money Tree If you're just getting started as an individual investor, congratulations! You've taken a big step toward financial independence. And since you're reading this article, you've put dividend stocks on your list. Great news: Dividend stocks can often be market-crushing long-term investments. The hard part? Investing in great companies that can continue paying that dividend and even raising it regularly, while still being able to invest in improving the business itself.  With that in mind, three of our regular contributors offered up what they think are the best dividend stocks for beginning investors. The list includes Procter & Gamble (PG) and PepsiCo (PEP), which own some of the most recognized consumer-goods and food brands in the world, and MasterCard Inc. (MA), another globally recognized brand, and a leader in electronic payments.  Quotes in the article PepsiCo Inc PEP ▲ 101.85 +0.46 +0.45% Procter & Gamble Co PG ▲ 83.62 +0.62 +0.75% MasterCard Inc MA ▲ 102.48 +1.34 +1.32% Keep reading to learn why our contributors think these stocks are ideal dividend investments for beginners.  Drink up great dividends Dan Caplinger (PepsiCo): One of the best ways for beginning investors to introduce themselves to dividend stocks is to focus on the companies behind the consumer products that they use every day. One great example is PepsiCo, which is best-known for its namesake cola. The beverage giant also makes Mountain Dew, Gatorade sports drinks, Tropicana juices, Lipton tea, and Aquafina water. Yet what many beginning investors don't realize is that PepsiCo is also the maker of Frito-Lay brand snacks, including Lay's potato chips and Doritos tortilla chips.© Provided by Fool Pepsico Products From a dividend perspective, PepsiCo has been generous with its shareholders. The stock currently sports a dividend yield of 2.8%, paying its shareholders $0.7525 every three months per share that they own. That yield is significantly above the stock market average, but what's even more impressive about PepsiCo's dividend is the fact that the company has given shareholders an increase in its quarterly payout every single year for 44 years running. The most recent increase came in June, adding 7% to the dividend. With such an attractive combination of opportunities to grow its core business and reward shareholders with future dividend increases, PepsiCo makes a great starting point for beginning investors looking for portfolio income. A solid defensive dividend stock  Neha Chamaria (Procter & Gamble): If you've just started investing, a great way to pick dividend stocks that can offer you good value for money is to look for companies with an easy-to-understand business, a defensive industry, a sustainable business model, and a track record of dividend increases. A dividend yield higher than that of S&P 500 should act as cherry on top. In those regards, Procter & Gamble is a perfect choice in every way.© Provided by Fool Pg Brands Chances are, you're using a P&G product every day. P&G's legacy dates to 1837, and its list of brands includes iconic names such as Gillette, Oral-B, Tide, Pampers, Crest, and Pantene. With a portfolio including 21 billion-dollar brands spread across more than 180 countries today, you can rest assured P&G will stick around for decades to come. The relatively inelastic demand for consumer goods has allowed P&G to grow its earnings and cash flows and reward shareholders richly over the decades: It has raised its dividend for 60 consecutive years. Here's what P&G's quarterly payout chart looks like:© Provided by Fool PG Dividend Per Share (Quarterly) Chart What I really admire about P&G is its consistently healthy conversion ratio. It's targeting 90% profit-to-FCF conversion and mid-single-digit growth in EPS for financial year 2017. P&G's ongoing restructuring, such as the divesting of less-profitable brands such as Duracell and Coty, should further boost its cash balances significantly, giving it leeway to raise its dividends in the years to come. Long story short: This 3% dividend-yield stock could be a great addition to your dividend portfolio today. A megatrend that should drive decades of dividend growth Jason Hall (MasterCard Inc.): MasterCard may seem a little out of place on this list, considering that its 0.74% dividend yield is downright paltry compared with Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo:© Provided by Fool MA Dividend Yield (TTM) Chart But don't get too caught up in the yield, particularly if you're just getting started investing. The thing that makes MasterCard such an excellent dividend stock to buy now and hold for years and years is the strong prospects to grow that dividend, as global electronic payments expand on the growth of the global middle class.  Electronic payments are a relatively small share of global transactions today, despite how ubiquitous they are in the United States. But with the global middle class on track to expand by around 1 billion people in less than 20 years, a lot more people will be making transactions without handing over cash in the future. And there's no doubt MasterCard will play a very important role in that expansion, with its secure network and strong reputation with both merchants and consumers. And all that growth will support potentially enormous dividend growth over the next 20 years.© Provided by Fool Mastercard Masterpass Image PepsiCo as an excellent example of how that could work out. In 2001, PepsiCo's quarterly dividend was a split-adjusted $0.145 per share, which yielded about 1.2% at the then-share price of around $49. Today PepsiCo's share price is above $105, and it pays a quarterly dividend of $0.752 per share, good for a yield of 2.8% if you bought shares today.  But for investors who bought shares back in 2001 for $49? They're collecting an effective 6.1% yield on their original investment, in a stock that was paying only 1.2% at the time. So if you're investing for the long term, a dividend growth stock like MasterCard could generate big income years from now.  SPONSORED: A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Brands have shifted large amounts of marketing budgets into online advertising, which must now up its game to pay the internet’s bills Surfers’ paradise: the internet has been mostly free since its inception. Photograph: pixdeluxe/Getty Images Supported by About this content David Benady Monday 7 November 2016 05.00 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger The supporters of an open, democratic internet, funded mainly by advertising, are facing some big questions about how their vision will unfold. A freely accessible digital world, where websites and social networks are open to all, is the dream of many. But critics wonder if this is desirable or even possible. Brands have shifted a huge proportion of their marketing budgets into online advertising in recent years, fuelling the growth of the internet and becoming the main source of funding for most websites and social networks. But while many campaigns hit the spot, others can be irritating, intrusive and irrelevant. How can advertisers and web publishers make sure ad campaigns are effective and entertaining enough to pay the internet’s bills, while ensuring online services don’t disappear behind a series of privately accessed paywalls? To discuss the future of online advertising, the Guardian teamed up with advertising technology provider AppNexus to run a roundtable discussion. The discussion was conducted under the Chatham House Rule, where comments were made on condition that they were not attributed to the speakers, to encourage a free-flowing discussion. A key point of contention in the discussion was how the internet should be funded. One participant was passionate about the ad-funded model: “Largely it should be free. It is a wonderful tool for accessing information, for consuming information and for the distribution of brands.” But another thought that the quality of content on the internet inevitably suffers “unless you have the resources to fund it.” There are fears that ad revenue is insufficient to pay for all the content that is needed for the web. “Generally speaking, the ad-funded model puts a downward pressure on the quality of content. I have no problem with subscriptions,” the speaker said, adding: “There is no reason why it should be free.” Digital advertising faces some serious challenges if it is to keep the web free – one of which is concerns over the ethics of tracking people’s online behaviour without their consent. The success of online ad campaigns is determined by the data that brands can access about internet users. How old are they? What are their interests? Are they male or female, single or with children? Much of this data will be collected from cookies downloaded on to users’ computers. Cookie data allows web publishers to track users’ online journeys and observe the actions they take on different websites. They can then use this data to helps them target campaigns to different groups. The impact of data protection regulation But the forthcoming European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), to be implemented in 2018, will tighten up data privacy – and this, some speakers felt, could undermine the ad-funded model of the internet. The stringent new rules, which force companies to get “unambiguous consent” from online users to make use of their data, are expected to be adopted in the UK regardless of Brexit. Some participants worried that the Directive’s clampdown on using data could make it difficult for certain companies to operate on the internet or to run advertising campaigns. “Some businesses may not survive,” warned one speaker. The participants also discussed whether website owners relying mainly on cookie data are at a disadvantage to websites and social networks where users log in and give their personal details. Facebook, for instance, has in-depth login information about users – their locations, names, likes, activities and friendship networks. The social network offers this data to brands, facilitating highly targeted advertising campaigns. One participant spoke of an ad campaign for the launch of a new product where a strong creative film was shown on Facebook. Depending on how users reacted to the film – whether they watched it the whole way through, or just with the sound off – more messages were served to them and these were refined in stages according to each user’s reaction. The speaker said this was highly effective, as it allowed the campaign to filter out those who were not interested and to deliver relevant messages to potential customers. Another speaker said Facebook allows brands to constantly change their online advertising as they receive new data about people’s likes and dislikes: “I really feel it is only since Facebook has come along that we have had this opportunity to assess data very quickly and then tweak that data.” But another pointed to a recent statement from household products manufacturer Procter & Gamble (P&G), the world’s largest advertiser, that it had decided to stop using Facebook’s targeting tools. “They had assumed it would be efficient to target (air freshener) Febreze to families with kids and dog owners, but it proved more efficient to go broad in the targeting.” P&G said it was better to promote some products to everybody rather than paying for targeted audiences, as everyone uses laundry detergents or washing-up liquid. Tightly targeted campaigns are more suitable for very specific, niche products. Some of the speakers were concerned that online advertising places too much emphasis on data and not enough on creativity and persuasion. The use of data was criticised as “the tail wagging the dog” and there was a recognition that some advertising creatives believe data gets in the way of making good campaigns. “They feel the use of data depersonalises,” said one speaker, who added the caveat that attitudes are changing. “I think people have got used to the fact it is not a case of either having data or creative – it is about using both together.” There was a consensus that cookie and login data works best for hard-sell campaigns, encouraging people to buy now, rather than for softer-focus, persuasive brand advertising. Retargeting – a waste? And speakers accepted that “retargeting” campaigns – whereby a user who has visited a website, perhaps to look at some shoes, then has ads for that website follow them around the internet for days, weeks or even months after – are unpopular with users. “It is so frustrating as an advertiser that I am spending on retargeting,” said one speaker. “I am very well aware that those advertising platforms aren’t good enough and that we are overly retargeting.” The problem of retargeting was seen as a failing of automated advertising – called “programmatic advertising” – where software dictates what ads people see based on the data. But some thought that as programmatic technology evolves to become more sophisticated, it will overcome these drawbacks and will deliver a better experience for users and brands. Facebook Twitter Pinterest OgilvyOne’s Jo Coombs gets her point across at the Guardian roundtable event, supported by App Nexus. Photograph: Sam Friedrich One problem with automated online advertising is that the ads may appear on any website and next to inappropriate content, for instance an ad for an airline could be placed next to an article about an air crash. But one speaker predicted that automated “programmatic” advertising will be able to answer this problem and help brands sift through data to find the most receptive audiences for their messages and identify the most appropriate places to run the ads. “Programmatic is very helpful for understanding who those people could be, what their behaviour looks like and how you could go about finding them.” Another compared the situation of programmatic advertising to email. “Email is one of the best-performing channels. But it was tainted for a time because it was abused.” The discussion turned to the use of machine learning, where software analyses data to make judgements about what products, ads and content people should be offered. One speaker said machine learning and robotics would revolutionise marketing. “What we’ve seen in programmatic advertising is one of the earliest areas where it has made inroads, but I think it will be right across the shop.” But another warned that widespread use of robotics and technology would lead to a depersonalised world: “People are just turning into a kind of jelly between lots of robots.” The discussion returned to the question of whether advertising will continue as the main source of funding for the web. One speaker thought younger users would be reluctant to ever pay for online content. But another disagreed: “We cannot assume that people between the ages of 12 and 21 are going to behave and operate like that for the rest of their lives. We all go through generational change.” At the table Jasper Jackson (Chair) Assistant Media editor, the Guardian Sanjeevan Bala Head of data planning and analytics, Channel 4 Romain Bertrand Managing director, eHarmony UK Steve Chester Director of data and industry programmes, IAB UK Chris Clarke Chief creative officer, international DigitasLBi Jo Coombs CEO OgilvyOne Nigel Gilbert Vice-president, strategic development, EMEA, AppNexus Annabel Kilner Commercial director, Made.com Sille Opstrup Head of digital, Pernod Ricard UK Giles Pavey Chief data scientist, dunnhumby Daniel Spears Programmatic director, the Guardian Bradley Love Professor of cognitive and decision sciences, UCL Sarah Todd CEO, Geometry Global Jamie West Deputy managing director, group director of advanced advertising, Sky Media UK To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox,sign up free for Media & Tech Network membership.

Yuri Gripas/Reuters Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Imagine a home audio equipment company promoting their new, cutting-edge sound system. The company uses a humorous advertising campaign and warns people that after they try their new product and hear all the wonderful sounds, they will realise they have been #earblind their entire life. Or, imagine a TV brand tweeting about a new model that allows you to see every colour perfectly. They promote it using a hashtag and promise people will not feel #eyedeaf anymore. If a company mocked deafness or blindness like this, there would rightly be an immediate backlash from affected populations and advocacy organisations, probably resulting in an apology – and the end of the offending campaign. But for the past two years, Procter & Gamble has been promoting its home freshener product, Febreze, using a “mockumentary” style campaign to warn people that they might have become “noseblind” to bad smells in their houses. It notes that other people can indeed smell their bad odours and will judge them. Luckily for those “noseblind” people, the company provides a solution. A series of videos, starring actors and displaying a funny “noseblindness” intervention have had more than one million views so far on Youtube. The problem is that “noseblindness” is a real condition: it’s called anosmia, and more than 5% of people across the world suffer from it. By making fun of their everyday problems, the campaign has offended people who have no sense of smell, appropriating their disability and turning it into a hashtag. Unfortunately for people with anosmia, their problems aren’t so easily solved: the condition has no cure. Anosmia – the real noseblindness Anosmia is a complete loss of the ability to smell. Some people lost their sense of smell as a consequence of a nasal condition or brain injury, while others are anosmic from birth. Research shows anosmia is related to increasing levels of stress and depression, as anosmic people face major challenges in everyday life. A recent study done in the UK exposed high rates of depression (43%) and anxiety (45%) among the anosmic population, as well as problems with eating (92%), isolation (57%), and relationship difficulties (54%). Three areas of life concern people with anosmia the most. First, because they are not able to discern the kind of nearby dangers that people detect through the sense of smell, such as smoke or gas leak or burning or spoiled food, they face safety risks. And because loss of smell usually implies no sense of taste, cooking and eating food loses much of their joy. Anosmic people also often feel social anxiety, because they are concerned about their own body odours. Anosmic people often lose their sense of taste. David W Cerny/Reuters Being unable to smell their loved ones is also a major issue: for example, when a parent cannot smell his or her newborn child. People with anosmia are dependent on others to identify smells for them, which leads to frustration and a decrease in autonomy. Misappropriation Anosmia affects millions of people in the world, with serious consequences for their quality of life. Yet there was no worldwide reaction to P&G’s “noseblind” campaign. No patient advocates, organisations or media covered the topic. Anosmic Facebook and Twitter users were upset about the campaign, but it has not advanced any further. In an interview that I conducted with her, Michelle Krell Kydd, a renowned scent expert and writer who was involved in the conversation around the campaign, explains that using a term “noseblind”, which is in the anosmia community’s lexicon, is a form of misappropriation. The problem, Kydd thinks, may lie in the fact that olfaction has so far been a “neglected sense”. As she told me in a recent interview I conducted with her: olfactory lexicon in the West is not highly developed, so this also factors into the cultural perception of smell which I describe as ‘the bastard stepchild of the senses,’ though this is changing due to research on the sense of smell and olfactory lexicon. Even if marketing executives from Procter & Gamble did not intend to offend people with disability, as they have explained to anosmic Twitter users in several conversations, they still had to issue a formal response. Loss of smell: untreatable and invisible At the heart of this campaign is the issue of anosmia generally: there is just little awareness of the condition. This invisibility is a consequence of several factors. The loss of smell is invisible itself; there’s no cure for anosmia (so no health-care system to support it); there’s no available smelling aid; and there’s a dearth of patient advocacy organisations. People with anosmia constantly have to explain their condition. And they’re often treated with a lack of sympathy by those with no olfactory problems, who trivialise or generally disbelieve anosmic suffering. Another problem that people with anosmia face is a general lack of concern by medical professionals. Apart from not being physically visible, anosmia is also invisible in regulations and health insurance system. A recent study featured testimonials by anosmic people expressing their dissatisfaction over the way the medical profession treats their condition. Is there hope for recognition? Recently, efforts have been made to make anosmia more prominent in the public discourse. Several organisations are struggling to raise attention to anosmic people and the difficulties they face in everyday life. But recognition for this disability is still far away. In my interview, Michelle Krell Kydd was optimistic about the future: When people understand why smell is incorporated into the human organism and how precious it is to their enjoyment of life and survival, you can begin generating momentum. This is something I think about every day. I’m an optimist and a smell evangelist, so I smell transformation in the air. Meanwhile, P&G’s campaign is still active and being positively reviewed by advertising and marketing experts. And Twitter users have started to use the #noseblind hashtag to express their concerns with everyday odours, unaware that well before they were introduced to this term, it was already a reality for millions. Sadly, the reality of not being able to smell is not something anosmic people can escape by using a home freshener.

STARTUP So You Want to Work in Tech? 3 Questions to Ask Yourself First While it may seem exciting to work in tech, that doesn't mean it's right for you. Before you waste your valuable time and connections, make sure you have good answers to these three questions first. By Bradley Tusk Bradley Tusk is the founder and CEO of Tusk Ventures and Tusk Strategies. He has worked with dozens of Fortune 500 companies, institutions, and startups to help them tackle regulatory hurdles, including AT&T, Google, Stanford University, Uber, Handy, and FanDuel. @BradleyTusk Founder and CEO, Tusk Ventures and Tusk Strategies@BradleyTusk WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement I've had a lot of different jobs over the years - in city government, state government and on the Hill, on political campaigns, at a big investment bank, and through my own companies, in industries like consulting, gaming, and digital archiving. My work today as a venture capitalist brings me into contact with people from virtually every industry and every sector. And I speak (probably too often) at conferences and universities, bringing me into contact with young people and students across the country. The one question I tend to get from virtually everyone is: how do you break into tech? Since my answers are starting to get repetitive, I figured I'd try to capture them here and hopefully that will provide some value for others asking themselves the same question. Like most good answers, my response is really just a series of questions in return. Why do you want to work in tech? Do you want to work in tech for a tangible and specific reason or just because you love your iPhone and tech seems interesting and cool? In the 80s, tv shows like LA Law had people applying to law school in droves. In the 90s, employers like McKinsey were the rage. Pre-financial crisis, everyone wanted to work at Goldman. Now it's tech. But tech really either means working for a very big company (Amazon, Google, Apple) that, at this point, is pretty much just another massive bureaucracy, so you're really working at Proctor & Gamble with a more interesting product line. Or, you're working at a startup, which can be a lot of fun, but statistically speaking, you're going to work insane hours for a relatively low salary and, in the end, probably see your equity be worth absolutely nothing (the odds of your getting in on the ground floor of the next Uber aren't that much better than winning the next Powerball). So tech seeming cool isn't enough and before pursuing tech jobs, you need a much better reason than "I've always found it interesting." Why would they hire you? Given that my work tends to revolve around politics, investing, communications, branding, and policy, if you're coming to see me, you're probably not an engineer. And if you're not an engineer, why would a tech company hire you? Sure, more established startups may have an in-house pr person or a General Counsel or a head of marketing. But the non-technical jobs at startups can be counted on your fingers and toes (and even most of those startups will ultimately fail). Unless you think you have an incredibly unique skill set that matches the exact particular needs of a particular startup at that exact moment, there's no reason for a promising startup to even talk to you. Hiring is a marketplace that tries to efficiently match the interests and skills of the applicant with the immediate needs and priorities of the employer. Absent a really compelling case for how and why your skills match perfectly with a specific startup's needs at that exact moment, there's no reason for them to even consider hiring you. Are you really that risk friendly? Because the societal image of a swashbuckling entrepreneur is exciting, people like the idea of working in tech. And sure, if you have absolutely no responsibilities, financial obligations, student loans and are completely comfortable emerging with nothing after two years, then working at a startup can be a good learning experience. But if you cannot actually afford a serious pay cut or you don't really want to work 16 hours a day or you don't want to move to the Valley or you can't sacrifice 2-5 years of your life to work for equity that will probably be worth absolutely nothing, then this is not for you. Be realistic about how much risk you can really take and don't waste your time and resources pursuing something that ultimately doesn't work for you. At the end of the day, the number of people who can give you useful advice about your next job and provide meaningful connections and recommendations is very limited. And those people do not have an endless supply of time, political capital or patience to keep helping you (remember, every time someone does a favor on your behalf, they then owe someone else something in return and it ultimately costs them money or resources that you never think about or see). So while it may seem exciting to work in tech, that doesn't mean it's right for you -- and it's even less likely that you're right for them. Before you waste your valuable chits, time and connections, make sure you have good answers to these three questions first.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest WhatsApp Print page Related Russia's 'Sputnik' heart could save thousands of lives in India Who exports Russian medicines; where are they sent? Tags russians, medicine, business Evgeny Demin and Elena Demina moved from the Krasnodar Territory in southern Russia to Moscow with a small idea and big ambitions. In 2000, when they were not yet 25 years old, they founded SPLAT, a company which today supplies personal care and household chemical products to 50 countries around the world. "In the beginning, the company specialized in the production of biologically active additives and cosmetics based on Spirulina platensis seaweed — thus the company name," explains Evgeny. They soon decided to target their efforts in another direction: on the production of next-generation toothpaste. "From the very start, we agreed to make the best toothpaste in the world, so that it would surpass all expectations," he said. The couple first rented a factory for their operations near Moscow and, in 2009, they opened their own plant 300 miles northwest of the Russian capital in the Novgorod Region. Today the factory employs more than 350 people, while a total of 1400 people work for the company, including in their sales and marketing offices abroad. Source: Press photo The company has opened a subsidiary and hired a local team in China and is now looking forward to working with the Chinese, said the SPLAT press service. The company’s premium products are particularly popular in Germany and SPLAT has also started to sell its products in France. The company currently owns more than 10 Russian and foreign patents. The right segment Right from the beginning, SPLAT toothpaste was priced around twice that of its supermarket rivals. Entering the premium segment, where there were practically no competitors, was one of the factors for the brand's success, said Alexander Yeremenko, managing director of the BrandLab marketing agency. Yeremenko said when SPLAT debuted, two major international players, Procter & Gamble and Colgate, had claimed the middle segment of the Russian market, while the lower end was dominated by Russian producers selling very cheap toothpaste. "In the high-price segment, besides LACALUT, there were no important players," Yeremenko said. Some of SPLAT's exclusive offerings include black toothpaste made from Karelian coal and golden toothpaste featuring extracts of diamond and colloidal gold. SPLAT's scientific laboratory and R&D centre in Moscow are in charge of developing the toothpaste's unique components. Source: Press photo The company began exporting their products in 2008 and, by 2015, foreign sales made up 17 percent of their revenue. One of their most successful foreign markets is Turkey, where SPLAT was able to sign an exclusive contract with one of the country’s leading perfume and cosmetics chains. A personal approach to customer loyalty The company has not divulged any financial indicators, but SPLAT holds 17 percent of the Russian market in terms of sales, said Timur Nigmatullin, an analyst at Finam Holding. Nigmatullin attributes SPLAT’s success in part to its unusual marketing strategy. The company does not employ TV advertising on principle and focuses its energies on repeat sales to loyal customers. Yeremenko believes that SPLAT’s marketing efforts were appropriate for a product in the high-end segment of the market where consumers value innovation and are ready to pay for it. "SPLAT did not have money for promotion, which is why all efforts were directed at achieving a high-quality and innovative product," Yeremenko said. The firm’s unique offerings, such as the first black toothpaste or having an unusual taste and components are all elements of marketing, which require constant research and experimentation, he said. The company also takes a personal approach to encourage brand loyalty. Each SPLAT toothpaste package contains a letter from Demin, the firm’s general director. At the end of each letter, he provides his personal email address adding that he responds to all messages himself. Source: Press photo "The director's letters in the packages create the impression of the producer's responsibility to the customer; [they] guarantee a quality approach and the company's excellent result on the market," Yeremenko said. Not just toothpaste Today SPLAT has diversified and it produces more than 200 different products from its 50,000 sq. ft. plant in the Novgorod Region. The company’s offerings include toothpastes, brushes, foams and mouthwashes, the BioMio ecological line of housekeeping products, the organic LALLUM Baby line of natural cosmetics for children and mothers and the HEYA series of natural shampoos and conditioners. HEYA is one of SPLAT's latest developments and is one of co-founder Elena Demina’s proudest accomplishments. "The idea of creating products for health and hair beauty that would be just as unique and effective as all the other SPLAT products, came to us a long time ago,” she said. “Our team spent more than five years working on it." The market for hair care products is highly competitive, but SPLAT’s offerings, made exclusively from natural ingredients without silicon or parabens, are unique. The company took its time developing the HEYA series components, but Demina says she is very happy with the result. "We do not compete with other hair care producers because, all modesty aside, we believe that our products are unique and unrepeatable," she said. A Russian doctor who was a healthcare pioneer in independent India Nigmatullin considers the Russian market robust and large enough to accommodate new products, despite the unfavourable economic situation and the difficult investment climate. "The SPLAT phenomenon is not the only one,” Nigmatullin said. “There are many other examples: UAZ, Ural motorcycles, a long list of medicines produced in local plants, confectionery and so on.” Yeremenko feels SPLAT’s success can be attributed to hard work and planning. "Actually, SPLAT's story is not as magical as it seems,” Yeremenko said.  “It is proof of a solid marketing approach, which basically any producer can adopt." In his view, the founders of SPLAT demonstrated sound judgment and perseverance in developing their idea. "The problem with most Russian companies is not the lack of ideas, but that they don't know where they're going,” he said. “But SPLAT had a strategy and most importantly, it patiently implemented it."  Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest WhatsApp Print page Multimedia A foreigner’s eye view of crossing Russia in a Trans-Siberian train News 5:20 PM 15 November 2016 Economy minister Ulyukayev denies bribe-taking — source 5:14 PM 15 November 2016 Russian Knights aerobatic team to take part in Iran air show for first time 2:28 PM 15 November 2016 Turkish premier may visit Russia in December 2:04 PM 15 November 2016 Almost 600 exotic birds confiscated at Moscow's airport customs 3:14 PM 14 November 2016 Russia, EU to hold talks on combating terrorism in early 2017 — diplomat 3:05 PM 14 November 2016 Iran’s demand for Russian weaponry is estimated at $10 bln 2:50 PM 14 November 2016 US expert says Trump may take ‘softer position’ on Crimea 2:18 PM 14 November 2016 Lawmaker says Russia, Iran may cancel visa requirements soon 1:27 PM 14 November 2016 Russia to join audit international standards in 2017 — minister 2:38 PM 11 November 2016 Russian diplomat praises security cooperation with China Business Calendar Read more  Culture calendar Read more  Photo of the day View More   About us Partners Advertising Contacts Careers Privacy policy RBTH Network: English Deutsch Français Italiano English - India Español Português 日本語 中文 Српски Hrvatski Български Македонски 한국어 Bahasa Indonesia हिन्दी Slovenski © 2007-2016 Russia Beyond The Headlines a global media project sponsored by:  Back to top + Like us on Facebook

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Shareablee Measures Social Performance for the Presidential Nominees Prior to the Election NEW YORK, Nov. 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Shareablee, the leading authority on social media measurement and intelligence has been busy keeping a pulse check on the election and the Republican and Democratic nominees’ social performance. In a review of their Facebook video performance the weekend leading up to the election, November 5 to 6th, both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton seemed to have changed content strategies a bit from pushing platform agendas to go and vote messages. Linked is the recent blog post with data on Facebook performance this past weekend. “The candidates don’t seem to be pushing platform agendas as much as the ‘GO AND VOTE’ message; with the Trump campaign focused on LIVE Facebook video while at rallies and the Clinton Campaign focused on the election journey. It’s a tale of two different methods to get to the same message,” noted Gloria Stitt, Head of Marketing & GM of Media. About Shareablee Shareablee is the first and only industry-level measurement solution for media companies and brands wanting to understand the impact and effectiveness of their cross-platform social media campaigns.

Commenting on the company's performance, Varun Berry, Managing Director of Britannia Industries said the company has witnessed positive momentum in the market growth over the last few months and expects the impact of good monsoon and flow through the 7th pay commission benefits would continue to support this trend. On the commodity front, prices of key raw material have had a high double digit inflation, which is much beyond what the company had originally estimated. While, the company has initiated price increases and accelerated its cost efficiency program, its focus is on remaining competitive in the market place and gain market share to build a sustainable business, Berry said. He further said that Britannia sees many untapped opportunities in its biscuit business and is actively working on other adjacent macro snacking business opportunities to ensure it stays ahead of market and achieves profitable growth to take it to the next level. Britannia Industries announced the appointment of N. Venkataraman as the new chief financial officer (CFO) of the company with effect from 1 December 2016, pursuant to resignation of existing CFO Amlan Datta Majumdar with effect from closing business hours of 30 November 2016.

Gains were broad, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reclaiming the key 18,000 level and the S&P 500 snapping its nine-day losing streak, the longest since 1980. The slide had been attributed partly to polls showing a closer contest between Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump. The outcome of United States presidential elections of 2016, which will be held today, 8 November 2016, will have a bearing on global stocks. Presidential election will be held between Democratic party candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican party candidate Donald Trump. The results are expected on the next day of elections.

This was first ever “Smash & Dash”  event put on by the program which usually runs a fundraiser every year. Other activities were also held inside the school including Smash Pong, Nailed It, Around the Way Wheel and Balloon Bust. They gave students the opportunity to win ballots for donated prize baskets. Radio broadcasting student Brett Black took part in the event and said it was a great idea to help a local charity. “It’s not often where if you want to donate to charity you’re actually able to hit an actual car with a sledgehammer, so that was pretty awesome,” Black said. Local celebrities were also invited to stop by and participate. Among these local faces was Mayor Taso Christopher. He said he was happy to come take part and support the students as well as the community. “It gives an opportunity for the dignitaries to get involved with the students and raise some much needed money for the United Way.” This event replaced the annual Truckload Sale, which raises funds for the United Way of Quinte by selling cheap products to students donated by Proctor & Gamble. This year P&G decided to donate products to those affected by the devastation of the Fort McMurray fires.

They do this by deftly focusing their marketing on three essential strategies: telling stories, inspiring emotion, and taking risks. Here's how CPG brands can emulate that strategy. 1. Telling Stories Entertainment brands wrote the book on telling stories. They do it all the time. But CPG brands can take a page from this classic entertainment strategy to bring their brands to life in memorable ways. The author of the mega-successful Harry Potter franchise was able to build a billion-dollar brand that continues to grow and engage new audiences. How? By telling consistent stories. J.K Rowling created a multidimensional landscape that enables the brand to expand its loyal audience over time. Harry's world has certain rules and truths that audiences instantly recognize. By staying true to those rules, the story can be replayed over and over again in different ways without losing its believability or diluting the brand. That strategy can be applied to CPG brands as well. Walk into any Lego store, and you'll see what I mean. Lego is all about exploration and its stores allow that to happen in a fun, yet educational way—"inspiring and developing the builders of tomorrow." Rather than simply viewing the Lego brand as plastic construction toys, the company has been telling a story for decades about the way children play and learn. That story supports the continuing growth of the brand into movies, games, competitions, and even amusement parks. Another example, Tesla has created a paradigm shift in the American car industry because it tells a familiar story in a new way. Tesla's CEO Elon Musk saw a way to transform the car industry, just like the industry's founder Henry Ford did. Tesla has taken electric technology into the premium market by offering gorgeous style, high-performance, and luxury all wrapped around renewable energy that helps the environment. The company is telling an optimistic story about the future. Consumers no longer have to settle for a boring car; they can have luxury and be environmentally friendly at the same time. Moreover, Elon Musk envisions eventually offering electric cars that will be affordable to the average consumer. 2. Inspiring Emotion Masters at surprise and suspense, entertainment brands use everything in their arsenal to grab attention. Teasers, trailers, posters, and social media posts focus on grabbing attention and driving an emotional reaction. Entertainment marketers know how to make feelings—whether horror, humor, inspiration, or romance—memorable. Pom Wonderful has used this effective strategy with its "Crazy Healthy" positioning brought to life in advertising with dragons, samurai, and archers brilliantly created using CGI pomegranate juice. Just as entertainment marketers use shock value to grab attention, POM's hyper-reality helps the company stand out from competitors by inspiring emotions that make the brand impossible to forget. The energy drink Red Bull uses a different but equally effective approach. It makes a connection to the extreme sports it sponsors and promotes (rally cross, downhill mountain bike racing, air races, sky diving, etc.) in an entertaining way. The Red Bull "Gives You Wings" slogan invites consumers to take action, fulfill their biggest dreams, and live up to their aspirations. Viral videos depicting athleticism and fearlessness mirror the rush consumers want from the product, capturing attention and encouraging everyone to excel. 3. Pushing Into New Territory Entertainment brands thrive on being the hippest, coolest, thing around—taking risks and doing things no one has ever done. For a CPG brand, that territory may seem like a dangerous place to go, but the rewards can far outweigh the risks. If you want to get consumers excited and talking about your brand, put a new twist on it. Eyeglass brand Warby Parker totally shook up the industry when it saw a way to create an e-commerce business with a personal, customized experience at an affordable price. Customers shop online but have the added convenience of trying eyeglasses on in the comfort or their homes. Taking advantage of a five-pairs/five-days free home trial, customers can see exactly what they're getting. GQ magazine dubbed the company "the Netflix of eyewear." Its success is related to how it built its brand story around a personal and customized experience, and it is further supported by the philanthropic part of its story. The company donates one pair of glasses for every one sold to people who can't afford glasses. You may remember Old Spice, Procter & Gamble's line of men's grooming products, as that dusty brand on your dad's shelf, but its recent efforts to tell its story in an off-beat way have made the company relevant to a new generation of young men. And the company did that by taking calculated risks with its advertising. Old Spice knew it hit the jackpot when the campaign featuring Isaiah Mustafa ("the man your man could smell like") went viral, and the company hasn't looked back. Its self-deprecating style is a tongue-in-cheek take on masculinity that works. Why? Because the company understands what moves its audience. It's not about being conventional; it's about taking risks and being a man, man. * * * Successful entertainment brands know how to break through the noise of competition. CPG marketers who face the same challenges can build successful brands by focusing on these three entertainment strategies. First, romance your consumers with messages and design elements that tell a consistent brand story, then differentiate your brand by taking courageous risks, and finally, make your brand unforgettable by forging strong emotional connections.

Group creative directors Ricky Vior and Rodrigo Butori and group account director Ana Bermudez will now also be vice presidents, with the former two promoted to executive creative director status. In their new roles, Vior and Butori will continue to work with clients including Verizon, Constellation Brands, Converse, The Kroger Company and BMW and report to The Community co-founder and CCO Joaquin Molla. Bermudez will continue leading the agency’s Verizon and Kroger accounts and reporting to The Community president Luis Montero. The Community was acquired by SapientNitro in early 2014, when it still went by La Comunidad. We first reported on the agency winning Verizon back in December of 2015, though a company spokesperson told us at the time that the telecom company had been working with the shop since last summer. According to several sources, Verizon continued that consolidation earlier this fall by moving multicultural creative on FiOS from Lopez Negrete to The Community. “Our position as a creative agency with a fresh voice in a crowded market place is due in large part to Ricky and Rodrigo and their efforts over the years, and Ana right out of the gate has shown a tremendous ability to partner and strategize with our clients,” Molla said in a statement. “This group of executives are cut from the cloth of curiosity and I have no doubt that they will continue to help us be fearless and focused as we grow and evolve.” Vior has been with The Community since the agency’s founding in 2000. Before joining The Community he served stints at Vegas Olmos Ponce/Lowe and BBDO as a senior/junior art director. Over the course of his career he has worked with clients including Nike, Pepsi, Volkswagen, Fedex, Audi, MTV, VH1, Citibank, and Subway. Butori joined The Community as a group creative director in 2009 following a stint as an associate creative director with David&Goliath. Before that he spent nearly two years in the same role at TBWA\Chiat\Day and earlier in his career held creative roles at Lowe Lintas Brazil, and Young & Rubicam Brazil. He has worked with clients including P&G, Toyota, Ford, Johnson & Johnson, ESPN, Visa, Virgin Mobile and Nissan. Bermudez arrived at The Community last year following serving as group account director for Alma DDB, where she worked on the McDonald’s, Diageo, and McCormick accounts. Previously she worked in account management roles at SapientNitro and Crispin Porter + Bogusky. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

[Photo/China Daily] Retail market analysts predicted that November's big shopping frenzy－the China-inspired Singles' Day－will see a year-on-year sales increase of 40 percent, as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and major international brands use virtual and augmented reality to woo online shoppers. Similar to the UK and US shopping day Black Friday, Chinese online retailers will offer a slew of promotions on Nov 11, and could generate up to US$20 billion sales this year, a 40 percent increase on last year's gross merchandise volume of US$14.3 billion, according to Fung Global Retail & Technology. The 2015 figure represented a year-on-year increase of 54 percent. This year, more British online retailers are joining in with specific offers targeted at China. In terms of online sales volumes, Singles' Day dwarfs Black Friday, the shopping holiday that unofficially marks the start of Christmas shopping in the United Kingdom and United States, falling on Nov 25 this year. Last year, Britons spent US$1.35 billion and Americans spent US$5.8 billion online over Black Friday and its web-based equivalent Cyber Monday. Fung Global said its 2016 forecast was driven by a tailwind from Chinese online shoppers' demand for overseas goods and by expectations for Alibaba's extensive marketing campaign, which this year exploits virtual and augmented reality features. Alibaba will pilot Buy+, a VR headset which will allow shoppers to walk around simulations of bricks-and-mortar stores in locations around the globe, simply nodding to confirm purchase of items. Macy's Inc's flagship store in New York is among participating retailers. British supermarket chain Sainsbury Plc has used a virtual reality promotion tool on Alibaba's online store Tmall in August. Sainsbury's reached top spot on Tmall in terms of orders during a one-and-a-half hour 360-degree live broadcast of its supermarkets in London. The event was the second most popular promotion since Sainsbury's live broadcasted an afternoon tea party on the Queen's birthday. Alibaba has also released a location-based augmented reality Pokemon Go-style mobile app ahead of Singles' Day. The company hopes to drive traffic from online stores to the physical stores of Tmall merchants as users follow an animated mascot on their phones through real city streets. International brands taking part include KFC and Starbucks. A number of British brands will offer discounts specific to Singles' Day this year. Coffee specialists Whittard of Chelsea, Liverpool Football Club and pet food provider Bob Martin will all be offering Singles' Day discounts for the first time, according to a Tmall representative. British brands returning with exclusive Singles' Day promotions include Jellycat, Cambridge Satchel, Myprotein and iconic fashion brand Burberry. Other major international brands joining for the first time include Target, Maserati, Apple, and Guerlain, while Zara, Bose, Samsung, Estee Lauder, L'Oreal P&G, and Unilever are all set to come back. Returning clothing and sportswear brands Uniqlo, Nike, Adidas, and New Balance were among the most popular brands in 2015. International brands are made available through country-specific portals on the Tmall website. Several of Alibaba's competitors are making moves ahead of Singles' Day. Kaola, the e-commerce and cross-border platform of internet service provider NetEase Inc, is partnering with Australian brands UGG and Bellamy's Organic.

In terms of online sales volumes, Singles' Day dwarfs Black Friday, the shopping holiday that unofficially marks the start of Christmas shopping in the United Kingdom and United States, falling on Nov 25 this year. Last year, Britons spent US$1.35 billion and Americans spent US$5.8 billion online over Black Friday and its web-based equivalent Cyber Monday. Fung Global said its 2016 forecast was driven by a tailwind from Chinese online shoppers' demand for overseas goods and by expectations for Alibaba's extensive marketing campaign, which this year exploits virtual and augmented reality features. Alibaba will pilot Buy+, a VR headset which will allow shoppers to walk around simulations of bricks-and-mortar stores in locations around the globe, simply nodding to confirm purchase of items. Macy's Inc's flagship store in New York is among participating retailers. British supermarket chain Sainsbury Plc has used a virtual reality promotion tool on Alibaba's online store Tmall in August. Sainsbury's reached top spot on Tmall in terms of orders during a one-and-a-half hour 360-degree live broadcast of its supermarkets in London. The event was the second most popular promotion since Sainsbury's live broadcasted an afternoon tea party on the Queen's birthday. Alibaba has also released a location-based augmented reality Pokemon Go-style mobile app ahead of Singles' Day. The company hopes to drive traffic from online stores to the physical stores of Tmall merchants as users follow an animated mascot on their phones through real city streets. International brands taking part include KFC and Starbucks. A number of British brands will offer discounts specific to Singles' Day this year. Coffee specialists Whittard of Chelsea, Liverpool Football Club and pet food provider Bob Martin will all be offering Singles' Day discounts for the first time, according to a Tmall representative. British brands returning with exclusive Singles' Day promotions include Jellycat, Cambridge Satchel, Myprotein and iconic fashion brand Burberry. Other major international brands joining for the first time include Target, Maserati, Apple, and Guerlain, while Zara, Bose, Samsung, Estee Lauder, L'Oreal P&G, and Unilever are all set to come back. Returning clothing and sportswear brands Uniqlo, Nike, Adidas, and New Balance were among the most popular brands in 2015. International brands are made available through country-specific portals on the Tmall website. Several of Alibaba's competitors are making moves ahead of Singles' Day. Kaola, the e-commerce and cross-border platform of internet service provider NetEase Inc, is partnering with Australian brands UGG and Bellamy's Organic.

News UK UK Politics Corporation tax is low enough already, don't cut it again, businesses say A survey by financial services firm PwC found that businesses don't think cuts will help much Jon Stone Political Correspondent @joncstone Monday 7 November 2016 14:47 BST The City of London's skyline Getty The Government should not cut corporation tax any further because it is already low enough and further reductions would have diminishing returns, businesses have said. A survey of businesses by financial services and accountacy firm PwC found that bosses believe cutting the profit tax rate further below 17 per cent would “have limited impact” and also “risk alienating the public”. It comes after suggestions in the press that the Treasury is examining whether or not to cut the tax-rate further in a desperate bid to attract foreign investment despite Brexit. Former Chancellor George Osborne said he would cut the rate to 15 per cent. Read more Government 'could cut corporation tax' as part of Brexit negotiations Ms Osborne had already cut the corporation tax rate to 17 per cent, the lowest in the G20, down from 28 per cent when he took office. The rate is a historic low; it was as high as 52 per cent under Margaret Thatcher. The UK’s rate is dramatically lower than its other competitor countries. The United States has a rate of 40 per cent, while Germany’s is 29.9 per cent, Japan’s tax rate is 32.3 per cent, and France’s is 33.3 per cent. The majority of businesses consulted by PwC – 71 per cent – said corporation tax should either stay at 20 per cent or not go below the 17 per cent cut pencilled in for April 2020. Summarising the findings, Kevin Nicholson, head of tax at PwC, said: “Businesses large and small recognise the benefits of a competitive corporation tax rate, but it’s not the be all and end all.  George Osborne dramatically slashed corporation tax as Chancellor (PA) “There comes a point when rate cuts have diminishing impact and can send unhelpful messages about business’ contribution, even though corporation tax is just one of the taxes business bears.  Businesses think there should more focus on the taxes that generate the most revenue such as national insurance contributions and VAT. ”  Business news in pictures 50 show all Business news in pictures 1/50 United goin down Manchester United's absence from the Champions League hurt more than the fans' pride last year - it also dented the bottom line.

Published on November 07, 2016. Most Popular A campaign by Kimberly-Clark Corp.'s U by Kotex aims to dispel the idea that periods change how women act, what they say and how they say it -- and argues that men actually have hormonal cycles very similar to women. The company began the #ItsNotMyPeriod campaign in Canada in September and has adapted it for Australia and Argentina as well. It may come to the U.S. eventually, according to a spokesman, though there are no immediate plans. The notion that women act differently or say things because of menstruation has a long history. It played out in a successful 1991 criminal defense in which premenstrual syndrome may have helped a Viriginia surgeon get acquitted on a drunk-driving charge and various cases in the U.S., U.K. and France where lawyers cited it as a mitigating circumstance for women accused of violent crimes. It was also at the center of the feud between Donald Trump and Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, when he said she had "blood coming out of her whatever" after she posed tough questions in an August 2015 Republican presidential debate. A video for U by Kotex from WPP's Ogilvy & Mather Toronto with help from affiliates in Colombia and the U.K. shows a skit with a female prosecutor making heated comments to colleagues about problems in a case. Men and women watching the skit are asked to identify which of the women is having her period. All point to the prosecutor and make unflattering remarks about her behavior. But later they acknowledge that she seemed most like the leader of the group, and like someone they'd like to have on their own team. The insights behind the campaign came out of a "social experiment" that included a wide range of age groups of men and women, said Ogilvy Toronto Chief Creative Officer Ian MacKellar. "One of the women was over 60, and her experience was very similar to that of women in their 20s, which suggests it's always been there behind the scenes," he said. "For too long a period has been used to explain a woman's behavior or her point of view or emotions, whether she's on her period or not," said Leslie Mackay, U by Kotex director of marketing and sales for Canada. "Because U by Kotex is so comfortable telling it like it is, and that a period is a natural part of being a woman, I think it's just time to start treating them that way." It's not just a problem that men inflict on women, she said. "Sometimes as women we will defer to claiming it's that time of the month because we've reacted to something strongly and seen the reaction on someone's face," Ms. Mackay said. "One thing that was really interesting when we did the research into periods and hormones was that these hormonal fluctuations in a month's time that a woman experiences are no different than what a man experiences throughout a month." Indeed, that latter problem even has a name: Irritable Male Syndrome. Men's testosterone level can go up or down four or five times an hour, is subject to daily cycles that make it higher in the morning, and even has seasonal variations that make it higher in November. However, testosterone levels may be about to plummet for many men, regardless of the outcome of the election. The Atlantic reports in its November edition that a study of the saliva samples gathered from men and women before and after the 2008 presidential election showed that testosterone levels plummeted in men – but not women – who voted for a losing candidate. This is among factors that make men who vote for losers particularly grumpy the day after an election. So perhaps it's no wonder that brands are mostly staying out of the presidential campaign. Sidestepping partisan controversy, the U.S. version of the Kotex campaign won't be coming until sometime well after the election, if it does at all. "We're excited by the creative direction of the Canadian program," said a spokesman for the brand in the U.S. "We're looking forward to seeing how this idea resonates with our target consumers in Canada." K-C isn't the only marketer steering clear of electoral landmines this cycle. Other brands that have been vocal about women's self-esteem issues in recent years, such as Unilever's Dove and Procter & Gamble Co.'s Always, have also been silent on controversies around Mr. Trump. Leaving aside the risk of alienating millions of Trump voters, the Always brand has never been about responding to news cycles, said P&G Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard. "Generally what we find works more effectively," he said, "is finding a cultural insight that matters, a culturally relevant situation that matters, but where the brand also matters, which then gives the brand the opportunity to express its point of view."
