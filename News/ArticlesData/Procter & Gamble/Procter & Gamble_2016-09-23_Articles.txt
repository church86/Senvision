Joe Manchin hosts eastern panhandle job fair Posted: Wednesday, September 21, 2016 3:52 PM EDT Updated: Friday, October 21, 2016 3:53 PM EDT By Marla Pisciotta An estimated 100 employers were scheduled to participate in a Procter & Gamble job fair Sept. 19. U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., along with WorkForce West Virginia, was host of the job and resource fair in Martinsburg — his 10th throughout the state. “I’m excited to help with the job fair,” Manchin said. “People are getting work — we’re pleased. Employees in West Virginia are more than capable of working.” Manchin said the job fair was set up to help people with everything from improving their skillsets to helping them get interviews for employment. GetReady Resources was there to help job seekers develop their careers, and a “MilitaryZone” provided information about getting an education through military service or by attending a military service academy. A total of 100 employers were scheduled to participate. “Come, tell us what you need and we’ll show you how to get it,” Manchin said in an interview Sept. 16 from his office in Washington, D.C. Procter & Gamble, Macy’s, and state and federal agencies such as the IRS were scheduled to participate. Procter & Gamble is in the process of constructing a new, massive manufacturing plant on nearly 450 acres of land in Tabler Station Business Park in Martinsburg. The Berkeley County facility will be the company’s second new plant in the United States since 1971. P&G’s initial investment in the project is $500 million. It is the fifth-largest consumer product company in the world, as well as the second largest in the United States. It is ranked 26 on the Fortune 500 list. The plant is projected to open in 2017.  This story first appeared in the print edition of The State Journal. Click HERE to subscribe.

Since its first shipment of Head & Shoulders shampoo in the country in 1991, P&G has won the trust and confidence of Pakistani consumers through the introduction of premium quality brands and sustained investments in the community, industry and human resource. Sharing his thoughts on this milestone, Sami Ahmed, Vice President, P&G Pakistan, said: “This is truly a historic occasion and a moment of great pride for P&G as we celebrate 25 years of successful operations in Pakistan. Through these years we have remained steadfast in our purpose to touch and improve the lives of Pakistan consumers. We’ve launched some of our world-renowned brands such as Pampers, Always, Safeguard, Head & Shoulders and Pantene which have since then become a special part of consumers’ everyday lives and therefore are amongst leading household names in their categories. Through our business growth, we have invested in the country by building factories and a strong supply base. This has led to the creation of thousands of jobs directly and indirectly. We are also improving lives of the community with programs like P&G Children’s Safe Drinking Water, Pampers Hospital Education Program and Mobile Clinics, as well as Safeguard and Always School programs.” He further added, “Pakistan is an important market for P&G. With a large, growing population, high urbanization, highly young population and evolving retail landscape, the country offers a significant consumer base with huge potential. We’re poised for future growth in Pakistan and look forward to celebrating many more milestones here in the years ahead.” For 25 years, P&G has continued to touch and improve the lives of millions of Pakistanis in meaningful ways, through premium quality brands, impactful social cause programs and the development of local skills.

Doc: Life, living are different roads Paul Daugherty , pdaugherty@enquirer.com 12:38 p.m. EDT September 24, 2016 Buy Photo Ken Schappell (Photo: The Enquirer/Paul Daugherty)Buy Photo “I’m blessed I’ve got a death sentence.’’ • Ken Schappell He’s up at 3 in the morning working out and a few hours later, he’s walking 2 ½ miles to the local McDonald’s. It gives him time to look at the stars. “Have you ever really looked at the stars?’’ he asks. Ken Schappell is a 57-year-old man who had everything and lost it in an instant. Now he’s getting it all back, and more, with no time to spare. A few of us come to perspective naturally. The rest of us have it forced upon us. On April 26, doctors told Ken he had a Grade 4 glioblastoma: A fatal brain tumor. He went from being high up in the Procter & Gamble corporate food chain to being unable to button his shirt, in a matter of minutes. The diagnosis was equally swift. “Looks like you have multiple tumors,’’ the neurologist said. Now, Ken wakes up and wonders, “If today is the last day, what should I do?’’ Ken doesn’t look sick. His workout regimen would shame a much younger man: Two hours on the elliptical machine, 30 minutes of lifting light free weights. He has lost some hair and some of the use of his left side. His coffee is a safe distance across the table, lest the cancer make him clumsy. He’s five minutes at the drive-thru ATM and some days he can’t tie his shoes. “I look pretty normal,’’ Ken says, “but I’m dying.’’ Best case is two to three years. Worst case is six months. By any physical measure, he is losing. But oh, what he has won. I know him because I know his son. Kevin Schappell was a basketball star at Loveland High School and Northern Kentucky University. He worked for Bob Huggins at West Virginia, before returning to NKU, to assist Dave Bezold, where he met Jillian Daugherty and became her friend for life. Jillian is my daughter, born with Down syndrome. She managed the men’s basketball team at NKU, when Kevin coached there. He welcomed her into the basketball brotherhood and made her feel special. She showed him that life can be a non-stop joy. Kevin and Jillian became co-conspirators in a happiness plot. We change each other’s lives. That’s the beauty of collaboration. Some reasons to love sports are obvious: The competition, the rivalries, the need to belong. Others are subtle: Memories and connections, mostly. And the ties that bind a basketball star to his developmentally disabled friend. And their mutual connection: The dad that influenced it all. Ken Schappell is chasing meaning as his days dwindle. He wants lots of things, not with a hot impatience, but rather a quiet urgency. They are essential things that those of us who are well so often assume: “I want to be nicer to people,’’ he says. “I ask people how their day is going. I want to be more generous.’’ And he wants a forever connection with his three kids, Kristina, Jessica and Kevin. “I want to tell them everything I’ve learned, and I know I don’t have time to do it.’’ So Ken asks them, “Tell me what you would like to know.’’ “We all have a death sentence,’’ he says. “Mine’s a little more certain. That certainty is a blessing.’’ Kevin was maybe 7 or 8 when he decided he wanted to play basketball. Soon enough, Ken put the hoop in the driveway. Over the years, it became the adhesive for their relationship. “Let’s go shoot, Dad,’’ meant, “Dad, I need you to rebound.’’ “I became the world’s best rebounder,’’ Ken says. They talk every morning now. Friday’s discussion touched on what each would miss, when Ken is gone. “Kev says, ‘I want Wesley to have the kind of relationship with you that I do’,’’ Ken recalls. Wesley is Kevin’s 22-month-old son. He will have Kevin’s memories. “Grandpa was a great rebounder. . .’’ Ken has time to do what he wants and half a million frequent flier miles to do it. He and his wife Karen have been to Las Vegas twice since his diagnosis. He has hiked the Smokies with Kristina, been to Indianapolis with Jessica. He’s going to the LSU-Florida football game with Kevin in a few weeks. “The nice thing about my condition is, I’ve been given six months to do all this,’’ Ken says. Still he wonders, “why wait ‘til a diagnosis to do these things?’’ Life and living are two different roads. The former is our path. The latter is how we navigate it. Ken says he has always told his kids how he felt about them. Now he wants to give them that same opportunity. Maybe what Ken doesn’t realize is, Kevin offers that tribute already, every time he’s kind to Jillian. Kindness isn’t innate. It’s inherited. “Jillian has a friend for life,’’ is what Ken says about that. On Sunday, Jillian and her husband Ryan will watch the Bengals play the Broncos. At Kevin’s house. 923 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORE TOP VIDEOS Lorenzo's Locks: Week 11 NFL picks 1:59 Punting tips and dance moves with Marquette King 1:00 Reflecting on Tony Stewart's legacy in NASCAR 2:52 A timeline of Johnny Manziel’s troubled history 2:02 Fighters square off at UFC Fight Night 100 faceoffs 1:14 Mets pitcher Jeurys Familia pleads not guilty to domestic violence charge 0:50 Pre-fight facts for UFC Fight Night 100: Bader vs. Nogueira 2 0:42 The Dallas Cowboys aren't just America's team 2:44 Three key NFL story lines to watch in Week 11 2:15 Carmelo Anthony at odds with Phil Jackson 2:09 Top five college football games to watch in Week 12 2:21 Mike Tirico to call four NFL games in place of Al Michaels 1:13 Tony Romo breaks silence on Dak Prescott, Cowboys' QB situation 4:57 Will the national anthem be booed in Mexico City? 2:41 LeBron James' view of Phil Jackson has changed 1:37 Jared Goff will make first start for Los Angeles Rams 0:49 NFL playoff picture after Week 10 1:23 Who's better?

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Sep 23, 2016 at 4:17PM Image source: Getty Images. For income investors, there's a certain Goldilocks quality to judging a dividend payout ratio. If the number is too small, say 10%, it implies that the company doesn't prioritize returning cash to shareholders through steadily increasing payouts. But a ratio that's too high isn't good either, since it points to slow growth -- or even a dividend cut -- in the future. The challenge, then, is often in finding that "just right" middle ground. What is a dividend payout ratio? The dividend payout ratio is the percentage of a company's earnings that it delivered to shareholders in dividends, typically over the prior 12 months. It's calculated by dividing dividends paid by net income and then multiplying that result by 100. You can perform this calculation either by using per-share figures or by sticking to total earnings and dividends. For example, if a company earned $1 per share of profit in the last year and paid out $0.50 per share in dividends, its payout ratio would be $0.50 / $1 * 100 = 50%. Likewise, if net income was $10 billion and dividends were $5 billion, the formula would be $5 billion / $10 billion * 100 = 50%. A strong but not too high dividend payout ratio is typically in the range of between one half and three-quarters of earnings. Problems with the dividend payout ratio The payout ratio is limited in what it can tell you about the strength of a dividend, though. For one thing, it keys off of earnings, which don't always capture a company's true operating situation. If a retailer is restructuring its business and taking writedowns for layoffs and store closings, for example, net income can sink in a given year, which would elevate the payout ratio. That's why it's helpful to look at a company's cash flow to judge whether the dividend is really in danger of being sliced. With that caveat in mind, here are the biggest payout ratios on the Dow today. Highest dividend payout ratios Stock Payout Ratio Caterpillar 197% ExxonMobil 117% Pfizer 100% Coca-Cola 78% Procter & Gamble 76% Source: Yahoo! Finance. Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) top this list due to sharp profit declines over the last few years as commodity prices dove. Yet while earnings are sinking, these companies managed to produce enough cash flow to comfortably cover their payouts. Caterpillar's operating cash was $2.8 billion over the last six months, or about three times its dividend payout. Exxon's $6 billion of dividends over the same time represented less than two-thirds of operating cash. Both companies have assured investors that they intend to maintain and even grow their dividends in the face of major industry downturns. Pfizer's dividend is in a much stronger position than its 100% payout ratio would suggest. Last year's earnings were pinched by foreign currency swings, costly acquisitions, and restructuring charges that aren't set to repeat in 2017. Its steady cash flow has in fact funded the return of nearly $9 billion to shareholders over the last six months. A fairly recent dividend cut, though, suggest there are better dividends among Pfizer's rivals.   Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) are facing serious business challenges as well, but they have suffered less dramatic profit swings thanks to their consumer-focused portfolios. The soda giant's sales volume growth has been unusually slow for years, and the same goes for P&G's organic sales gains. Yet both companies have demonstrated a willingness and ability to boost their cash returns to shareholders. In Coke's case, that includes a fund-raising initiative to sell off portions of its bottling network. For P&G, it involves parting with some of its biggest brands, like Duracell batteries and Coty beauty products, so that the remaining business can be stronger and more profitable. None of these elevated payout ratios portends a dividend cut, mainly thanks to healthy cash flow trends. That's why income investors who can stomach the volatility that comes with a cyclical business like Caterpillar's might find its nearly 4% dividend yield enticing. For a clearer profit growth outlook and a high -- but sustainable -- payout, consider investing in Coca-Cola. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Sep 23, 2016 at 11:31AM Dividend investors regard tobacco giant Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) as a strong prospect, known for a favorable dividend policy that treats its investors much better than how most other stocks pay their shareholders. Yet many investors underestimate just how important dividends are to the value proposition Philip Morris stock offers, and it's easy not to understand the full magnitude of the company's payments of its income to shareholders. Let's take a closer look at three things you need to know about Philip Morris and its dividend. 1. Philip Morris is a dividend payment leader. Philip Morris is a large company, but it's far from the largest in the stock market. With a market capitalization of less than $160 billion, there are plenty of other stocks that are valued more highly. Yet Philip Morris still ranks among the leaders of the entire stock market when it comes to how much money it returns to shareholders in dividends. The consumer staples sector of the S&P 500 as a whole has been a dividend stalwart for the overall market, ranking second only behind technology and paying out $14.3 billion in dividends during the second quarter. By itself, Philip Morris was responsible for more than 10% of the sector's total, paying $1.59 billion in common dividends during the quarter. That ranked only behind Procter & Gamble in terms of total cash dividend paid within consumer staples, a company with half again Philip Morris' market capitalization. 2. Philip Morris' dividend yield stands above its peers. Philip Morris currently has a dividend yield of 4.1%. Although you can find plenty of stocks with higher dividends, what's rare is to find companies that are able to match Philip Morris' yield after becoming leaders in their respective industries and attaining megacap status. Within the S&P 500, there are currently only three other stocks with market capitalizations of more than $100 billion that have higher yields than Philip Morris. They include telecom giants AT&T and Verizon, which have always had a history of making utility-like dividend payments to their shareholders out of the massive cash flow their respective telecom networks generate. In addition, Chevron currently has a higher yield, reflecting in part the more than 20% drop in its stock price since its 2014 highs in the aftermath of the plunge in crude oil prices. 3. Philip Morris has a perfect record of dividend growth. Philip Morris has been an independent company for nearly nine years now, and in each of those nine years, it has made dividend increases. The tobacco giant has repeatedly stated its commitment to supporting a dividend policy that not only rewards shareholders with quarterly payouts but also boosts the size of those payouts over time. That policy hasn't come without challenges. Currency-related headwinds have plagued Philip Morris' earnings for a couple of years now, and that has brought growth to the company's revenue and net income to a near-standstill at times. Philip Morris has responded by reducing the size of its dividend hikes, but it nevertheless hasn't stopped making at least small increases over the past couple of years. When conditions in the foreign exchange market reach a new equilibrium, Philip Morris investors hope that dividend growth will accelerate. Philip Morris is a dividend powerhouse, and there are many ways in which the company stands out from the crowd for income investors. The three aspects discussed above make it clear that Philip Morris can be a valuable component of a dividend stock portfolio for those who want regular, reliable income from their holdings.

The Imagine Entertainment co-founder was among a handful of TV producers and studios this week making outreach to clients of Omnicom Group, the large advertising-agency holding company. Each year, the company’s media-buying operations, which includes agencies like OMD, PHD and Hearts & Science holds a showcase known as a “Final Front,” which brings together media outlets seeking to strike deals with the company’s blue-chip clients, which these days include Procter & Gamble, McDonalds, State Farm and Apple. In the past, the assemblage has focused largely on weaving advertisers into new content ideas, but this year, the emphasis is shifting, said Claudia Cahill, chief content officer of Omnicom Media Group, in an interview (pictured, above). Marketers see video being distributed acorss mobile screens and want to incorporate that into the plans they concoct with TV programs, she said. “Content is being created everywhere and our partenrs are much more open and willing to customize,” she said. Related Who Wants To Buy An Ad In Mark Burnett’s New Digital-Media Treasure Hunt? Grazer’s pitch serves as an interesting example of the ideas that were bandied about at the meetings, which included presentations from media outlets including NBCUniversal, Viacom, Vice, CW, Conde Nast, BuzFeed, AwesomenessTV, PopSugar, Upworthy and LiveNation. The producer offered a look at “Chasing Genius,” a companion to a new scripted series called “Genius” that is being readied for debut on National Geographic Channel. The main series profiles innovators like Albert Einstein. But “Chasing Genius” looks at teams using crowdsourcing to gain insights to solve global challenges. FX put a spotlight on a companion series to the networks’ longrunning comedy, “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” Dubbed “Project Bad Ass,” the new project offers to bring an advertiser into a virtual-reality series aimed at fans of “Sunny.” Viewers get to “join” the character “Mac” from “Sunny” as he set out on various – and often ill-fated – extreme sports stunts. Producers see an “unprecedented opportunity for brands to become part of the action and engage with consumers in a cutting-edge and exciting new medium,” said Eric Schrier, president of original programming, FX Networks and FX Productions, in a statement. Then idea of the “Final Front” is to give Omnicom clients first crack at developing interesting content alliances before others might get word of them. Getting early notice of such availabilities has become more important on Madison Avenue, where many advertisers are trying to build new ways to support programs that aren’t as distracting as the typical 30-second TV ad, which tends to interrupt an audience increasingly able to turn to other content thanks to new technology.

However, our audiences are no longer a given. Publishers and advertisers need to meticulously tailor their content to survive in a cutthroat media landscape. Disruption in our industry is the norm The Internet is maturing and evolving at an unprecedented speed. Disruption is the norm and advertisers need to react with agility and intuition. While traditional online display advertising still makes a profit, rising challenges such as banner blindness among readers are limiting its effectiveness. Native advertising, content marketing and/or remarketing are climbing the ranks as real options to make money from a publishers’s digital audience. The emergence of ad blocking A key issue on the global digital advertising agenda is ad blocking. While ad blocking is still in it’s infancy and relatively low in South Africa, it does hold the potential to impact the ability for advertisers to achieve the laser point 'holy grail' of ‘right message, right person, right time’ and of course, more recently, ‘right device.’ This has a bearing on actual acquisition costs and efficiency. As marketing is driven by cost per acquisition, ad blocking limits audience reach, regardless of what platform they are using. A united front to counter ad blocking As a global organisation, the IAB is spearheading the digital advertising industry’s reaction to this phenomenon. On September 15 2016, the Coalition for Better Ads was announced in Cologne, Germany, at the Dmexco conference. In addition to the IAB, founding members include heavyweights such as Google, Facebook, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, the 4As, the Association of National Advertisers, the World Federation of Advertisers, The Washington Post and GroupM. Using technology currently being developed at the IAB's Tech Lab, the consortium aims to monitor digital ad campaigns, scoring them on everything from creative to load time. Standards will be set using data gleaned from the system as well as from consumer feedback and input from marketers. As IAB CEO Randall Rothenberg says, it is critical that, as an industry, we create standards that ensure that consumers get safe, fast, secure delivery of the sites and services they love. So far, ad blocking has been less of a challenge in our ‘mobile-first’ context. That does not mean that SA publishers do not need to prepare for ad blocking as they grow their digital presence and audiences. Rather, the idea that global audiences feel led to block out irrelevant advertising should shape what we choose to publish, and how we engage with readers that are becoming increasingly discerning. Ultimately, it’s about great content The Internet cannot survive without content. In South Africa, we have reached a crossroads rich in opportunity. While our oldest print and press partners are experiencing challenges, our digital industry is hungry for excellent content. We cannot afford to lose good journalists with years of experience because one segment of the media is struggling. As the IAB SA, we are committed to finding ways to supporting our various member sectors to integrate journalists that can no longer work in the print environment, finding them a place within the digital ecosystem. We aim to turn the disruption within print into dialogue. This speaks to the digital publishing industry’s need to deliver relevant content to their audiences in a seamless manner. This content is created by skilled teams that need to be paid competitive salaries. Therefore, digital advertising needs to evolve in such a way that online teams are able to monetise their business and keep creating great content. It’s also about getting to know your users We recommend publishers and brands engage more intimately with their users to establish want they will and won’t accept to remain loyal readers and customers. Open up a dialogue with users so they can contribute to the boundaries of their experience of the platform and what will serve them best. Enhance their experience by making it seamless and laser pointed in its relevance to the individual. Humans are more than a set of data points, possessing their own idiosyncrasies and preferences. They are consumers of content, but also consumers of relevant products and services. The right advert addresses an individual need. In this sense, digital advertising should be a welcome diversion and not a rude interruption. If we strike this balance, publishers and ultimately their advertisers will retain, or in some cases win back, the trust of their audiences. About the IAB South Africa The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) South Africa, formerly the DMMA, is an independent, voluntary, non-profit association focused on growing and sustaining a vibrant and profitable digital industry in South Africa.

Profit taking may weigh on the markets, as traders cash in on the recent gains. Trading activity may be somewhat subdued, however, with a lack of major U.S. economic data keeping some traders on the sidelines. U.S. stocks advanced for the third straight session on Thursday amid the release of some domestic economic data, an extension of the commodity rally and a lingering positive reaction to Wednesday's Fed decision. The major averages opened higher and moved roughly sideways in a broad range. Although there was a loss of momentum in late afternoon trading, renewed buying lifted the averages yet again, leading to a positive close. The Dow Industrials added 98.76 points or 0.54 percent before ending at 18,393, the S&P 500 Index closed 14.06 points or 0.65 percent higher at 2,177 and the Nasdaq Composite closed at a new record closing high of 5,340, up 44.34 points or 0.84 percent. Twenty-eight of the thirty Dow components ended the session higher, while only two stocks declined. Procter & Gamble (PG), Disney (DIS), United Technologies (UTX), Coca-Cola (KO), Boeing (BA), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Apple (AAPL) and Verizon (VZ) were among the biggest gainers of the session. Among the sectors, housing and oil service stocks advanced notably, but gold stocks gave back some ground. On the economic front, the Labor Department reported that jobless claims fell to 252,000 in the week ended September 17th from 260,000 in the previous week. Economists had expected an uptick in claims to 262,000. The four-week average fell to 258,500 from 260,750. Continuing claims calculated with a week's lag were down 36,000 to 2.113 million. A report released by the National Association of Realtors showed that existing home sales came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.33 million units in August, down from the downwardly revised 5.38 million-unit rate for July. Economists expected sales to have come in at a 5.44 million unit-rate compared to the 5.39 million-unit rate initially reported for July. Single-family home sales fell 2.3 percent, but condominium sales jumped 10.5 percent. Existing home inventories measured in absolute terms fell to 2.04 million units from 2.11 million units, with the months of supply at 4.6 months. The median price of an existing home fell 1.3 percent month-over-month to $240,200, rendering the annual rate to 5.1 percent. The Federal Housing Finance Agency said its house price index climbed a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent month-over-month in July, ahead of the 0.4 percent growth expected by economists. The annual rate of growth accelerated to 5.8 percent from a revised 5.7 percent. The Conference Board reported that its leading economic indicators fell 0.2 percent month-over-month in August, while economists expected a 0.1 percent increase. The July growth was upwardly revised to 0.5 percent from 0.4 percent. Six of the 10 components making up the index served as drags, while the interest rate spread continued to positively influence the index. The Chicago Federal Reserve's national activity index unexpectedly fell to -0.55 in August from 0.24 in July, suggesting a contraction in activity. Meanwhile, the Kansas City Federal Reserve's regional manufacturing index improved to 6 in September from -4 in August. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures for November delivery are slipping $0.11 to $46.21 barrel after climbing $0.98 to $46.32 a barrel on Thursday, marking the fourth straight session of gains that lifted futures to the highest level since September 8th. Gold futures are currently trading at $1,343.80 an ounce, down $0.90 from the previous session's close of $1,344.70 an ounce. On Thursday, gold rallied $13.30. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 100.79 yen compared to the 100.76 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Thursday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1220 compared to yesterday's $1.1208. Asia The major Asian markets went about in a lackluster manner before ending mixed as the central-bank induced din died down. The Japanese, Chinese, Shanghai, Hang Seng and Indian markets ended lower, while the rest of the markets posted gains. With the yen remaining close to its recent lows, the Japanese market experienced some profit taking, as it re-opened after yesterday's public holiday. The Nikkei 225 Index languished below the unchanged line throughout the session before ending down 53.60 points or 0.32 percent at 16,754. Retail, export, financial, real estate, telecom and chemical stocks moved to the downside. However, housing, refining, utility and pharma stocks ended mostly higher. Food stocks saw mixed sentiment. Australia's All Ordinaries Index rose steadily after showing tentativeness in early trading. The index closed 52.30 points or 0.96 percent higher at a 3-week high of 5,519, rising for the fourth straight session. The market witnessed an across-the-board rally, with telecom, real estate and healthcare stocks among the standout performers. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended at 23,687, down 73.32 points or 0.31 percent, and China's Shanghai Composite Index closed 8.42 points or 0.28 percent lower at 3,034. On the economic front, provisional results released by Markit showed that the Japanese manufacturing sector returned to expansion, with a PMI score of 49.2 in September compared to 49.5 in August. Meanwhile, all industry activity grew at a slower pace in July, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said. The all industry activity index rose 0.3 percent month-over-month in July following June's 1 percent increase. Nonetheless, this was the second consecutive increase in activity and better than the expected 0.2 percent growth. Europe European stocks are seeing weakness on profit taking after gains in recent sessions, with oil's weakness and weak private sector activity data weighing on stocks. On the economic front, the eurozone private sector grew at the slowest pace in 20 months in September, flash data from Markit showed. The flash composite output index slid to 52.6 in September from 52.9 in August. Economists had expected the reading to fall marginally to 52.8. The factory PMI improved to 52.6 from 51.7 in August, while it was expected to fall to 51.5. Meanwhile, the services PMI dropped to 52.1 from 52.8 in the prior month. This was the lowest in 21 months. The index was forecast to remain unchanged at 52.8. French statistical office INSEE downwardly revised its second quarter GDP estimate for France to show a 0.1% drop following a 0.7 percent increase in the first quarter. The preliminary estimate showed no growth for the second quarter. U.S. Economic Reports Markit is set to release its flash U.S. manufacturing PMI for September at 9:45 am ET.

Reprints Reprints 'Dateline' has examined the Steven Avery case both before and since the Netflix series 'Making a Murderer.' Credit: Courtesy NBC Most Popular Decades before "Serial" and "Making a Murderer" made true crime a phenomenon in new media, and before "The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story" won more Emmys than "Game of Thrones," "Dateline" was telling the stories of little-known crimes taking place in small towns in Kansas or rural Ohio week in and week out. The NBC series began its 25th season on Friday, joining a vanishingly small group of TV series to last so long. Other members of the club include "60 Minutes," "The Simpsons," "Survivor" and not many more. But "Dateline" also starts its latest run in a unique position, both buoyed and crowded by the surging interest in true crime. Newcomers are generating greater buzz on stories similar or identical to those that "Dateline" regularly covers by elevating them to the stature of critically acclaimed dramas. Then there are the downdrafts on traditional TV generated as viewers migrate to rivals like Netflix, drawn by programming such as "Making a Murderer." "'Dateline' doesn't get the credit, but if you went back and looked at the audience for when it started doing true crime, it was likely a way bigger audience than what any of these others have done," said Robert Thompson, TV and pop culture professor at Syracuse University. If you give "Dateline" its proper due, you notice that it was one of the first to throw a spotlight on the Steven Avery case at the heart of "Making a Murderer." It also extensively covered the O.J. Simpson trial that has recently recaptured the nation. The show "preceded, and you can argue was an instigator of, the true crime conversation," said "Dateline" senior executive producer David Corvo. Now "Dateline" is looking to keep up with the burgeoning competition by experimenting with a six- or eight-part series of its own delving into one long-running case. It's also giving its own takes on stories that have become part of the cultural zeitgeist. A one-hour special on the Steven Avery case including a rare 2005 interview with Penny Beerntsen, the victim in the sexual assault case for which Mr. Avery was wrongfully convicted, was watched by 5 million viewers on the night it aired in January and 2.1 million in the key 25-to-54 demographic. It added another 1.2 million viewers in DVR and on-demand viewing in the three days after it premiered. A two-hour special on the O.J. Simpson case featuring an interview with lead prosecutor Marcia Clark averaged 6 million total viewers and 2.4 million in the 25-to-54 demo. Its take on the JonBenét Ramsey murder, another story that has been thrown back into the spotlight in recent weeks, was watched by 6.5 million people earlier in the month. And the show will be doing 15 consecutive two-hour specials to commemorate its anniversary. But even as Mr. Corvo watches others find success in a genre that "Dateline" helped build, he said he doesn't feel the need to drastically alter a strategy that has accumulated a loyal audience over the show's life. In its heyday, "Dateline" often ranked within the 10 most-watched TV programs of the week. Today it isn't a hit in the traditional sense, but pulls an impressive audience for what's typically considered a dead zone for TV, averaging about 4.8 million viewers on any given Friday in its latest season and 1.7 million 25-to-54-year-olds. (The show also airs a Sunday edition that does not regularly cover true crime.) It has a stable roster of advertisers such as Procter & Gamble, Pfizer and Chrysler. While it surely isn't on any marketer's must-buy list, it is an efficient TV play that delivers consistent, loyal audiences."Dateline" also boasts celebrity fans like Taylor Swift, who admitted in a 2016 Vogue article that "Dateline" is her favorite show. Kim Kardashian told Harper's Bazaar in 2015 that she loves watching "Dateline," and Demi Lovato discussed her obsession with the show during an interview with Jimmy Fallon. "It is important for us to not lose our way," Mr. Corvo said. "The stories in little towns about people who are not famous and crimes that are not widely known that touch upon faith, family, betrayal—we don't want to lose sight of those." While some of those may end up becoming the Steven Avery stories down the road, for "Dateline" the focus is on "maintaining a relentless hum," Mr. Corvo said. "It is a marathon, not a sprint, and once in a while you need to pick up the pace to catch up." Unsolved mysteries "It is a very different business to be on the air two times a week and produce 100 hours of programming," he added. "These other programs, it's a few hours of content and they have tremendous time to do them and a ton of marketing." Even as the true crime space becomes increasingly crowded, there are no plans to pivot away from unsolved cases, wrongful convictions and surprising culprits. But Mr. Corvo said the show's creators are always looking at opportunities to take the franchise in new directions. Last year, "Dateline" aired "On Assignment," a limited series anchored by Lester Holt and featuring pieces from NBC News. "Dateline" has come a long way from its first season, when former producers and NBC News executives came under fire for staging a car explosion for a segment on the dangers of a General Motors truck. But "Dateline" not only survived, it thrived. At its peak, the show aired five nights per week. Stars including Katie Couric, Bryant Gumbel and Ann Curry passed through its doors. 'Dateline' anchors Dennis Murphy, Andrea Canning, Lester Holt, Keith Morrison and Josh Mankiewicz. Credit: Courtesy NBC In those early days, "Dateline" aired some segments on unsolved cases and other mysteries, but the focus was on breaking news and deep dives on current events. "I did a ton of animal stories," recalled correspondent Keith Morrison, who has been with the program since its birth aside from a short stint as a morning news anchor in his native Canada. "There were three different episodes on Keiko, the whale in 'Free Willy.'" But when the show aired an episode centered on a wrongful conviction or grisly murder, "people stood up and paid attention," Mr. Morrison said. The highest-rated episode ever was a 1998 murder-mystery titled "Cliffhanger," about a woman falling from a cliff. "Dateline" partnered with Court TV in the late '90s to document courtroom dramas that became popular after the O.J. Simpson trial. "But we became more interested in the stories that happened outside of the courtroom," Mr. Corvo said. In the mid-2000s, it generated deafening buzz with a new kind of crime programming: "To Catch a Predator," a hidden-camera show where host Chris Hansen presided over stings targeting pedophiles. The sub-franchise concluded in 2007 amid criticism of its tactics. In fall of 2006, Mr. Corvo said they realized that the show needed to be more predictable, and that's when the team started to regularly air hourlong crime stories on Friday nights. It's hard to believe that Mr. Morrison, whose ominous narration has become synonymous with the show, "had to be dragged into" reporting on unsolved cases and other mysteries. "I didn't think it was appropriate, in some way, to ask people very personal questions about these terrible things that happened and then tell that story on TV," Mr. Morrison said over the phone from a farm in North Dakota, where he was filming an episode for the 25th season. But Mr. Morrison said "Dateline" isn't about exploiting the horrors of other people's lives. He is proud of the work the show has done in exposing weaknesses in the criminal justice system. "Dateline" has helped set free at least five inmates who were wrongfully convicted. Staffers mention a show mantra from correspondent Dennis Murphy: "It's not about the murder, it's about the marriage." "It's not about the crime," Mr. Corvo explained, "but everything in the person's background and the story that led to the crime." Mr. Corvo admits that it has become more challenging to find great stories in an era when there's significantly more competition. As much as the strategy for the Friday-night edition has remained consistent, Mr. Corvo said "Dateline" is working to extend the brand both on linear TV and digital and social platforms. Digital offshoots include "Missing in America" and "Cold Case Spotlight," which highlights reports of missing people or cold cases that viewers submit. "Dateline" is also building out its social presence, with Mr. Morrison and other correspondents and producers engaging with its over 400,000 Twitter followers during and after episodes. But ultimately the point of pride is telling a strong narrative that gets to the heart of the human condition, said Mr. Corvo. "I could make these stories last a whole season," Mr. Morrison said. "We are not there yet, but maybe one day."

Energy was the worst performing major S&P sector, dropping 1.3 percent. Oil prices tumbled 4 percent on signs that Saudi Arabia and Iran were making little progress on a bilateral agreement ahead of talks by crude exporters aimed at freezing production. Facebook shares fell 1.6 percent and were one of the biggest drags on the S&P 500. The Wall Street Journal reported that the social media company overestimated viewing times for video ads. Even so, the S&P 500 recorded its best weekly performance in more than two months. Stocks were given a boost on Wednesday when the US Federal Reserve decided to keep rates steady, leaving intact the low-interest-rate environment that has helped fuel the bull market. “I just think after a few strong days and a little weakness in energy that folks are taking some profit before the weekend,” said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager with Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, Texas. “I just feel like the market is going to keep grinding higher.” The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 131.01 points, or 0.71 percent, at 18,261.45, the S&P 500 lost 12.49 points, or 0.57 percent, to 2,164.69 and the NASDAQ Composite dropped 33.78 points, or 0.63 percent, to 5,305.75. For the year, the benchmark S&P 500 is up about 6 percent. With the highly anticipated Fed decision now past, investors are turning toward the upcoming corporate earnings season and US presidential election, with the first debate tomorrow. “We have a lot of noise coming in with the end of the quarter and the debate,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. “But given what the Fed has done, I think we have volatility with a bias to the upside.” Nine of 11 major S&P sectors ended lower. The tech sector fell about 1 percent, with Apple shares down 1.7 percent on concerns about iPhone sales. Twitter Inc shares surged 21 percent on reports that the microblogging company had initiated talks with several technology companies to explore selling itself. Google parent Alphabet Inc ended unchanged, while Salesforce dropped 5.6 percent after both were reported to have shown interest in buying Twitter. Oil-linked stocks retreated, with petroleum prices, as Halliburton Co shed 1.9 percent and ConocoPhillips declined 2.6 percent. Dow member Procter & Gamble Co (P&G) fell 1.4 percent following a report from Bloomberg News that said P&G brands in skin care and men’s shaving were losing US market share to competitors. Yahoo Inc sank 3.1 percent following the Thursday disclosure that hackers took data on at least 500 million users, one of the biggest thefts of personal data ever. Marriott International Inc shed 1.9 percent after announcing it completed its US$13.6 billion takeover of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. Endo International PLC shares jumped more than 15 percent after the drugmaker announced a new chief executive. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.13-to-1 ratio; on NASDAQ, a 1.67-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted seven new 52-week highs and one new low; the NASDAQ Composite recorded 88 new highs and 13 new lows. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1235 times. Comments will be moderated.

How well his strategy works may say a lot about the future of specialty retailing amid competition from Amazon and shoppers’ abandonment of suburban malls. Share story By Matt Townsend Bloomberg News Dave Brandon has been inside a Toys R Us in Secaucus, N.J., for all of five minutes before he spots a problem. At the entrance, there’s a display of small cardboard bins filled with $1 playthings that look messy, and even worse — cheap. “It kind of reminds me of a garage sale,” says Brandon, who became chief executive officer of the world’s biggest toy chain 14 months ago. “We’re not the dollar shop. We’re a toy store.” In the Star Wars section nearby, a Chewbacca chair has tumbled over into the aisle. The 64-year-old CEO grabs it and turns it right-side up. Toys R Us at a glance Founded: 1948 in Washington, D.C. Headquarters: Wayne, N.J. CEO: David Brandon. Number of stores: 864 (Toys R Us and Babies R Us) in the U.S., more than 755 international stores Annual workforce: 62,000 2015 sales: $11.8 billion 2015 loss: $130 million Current debt: about $5 billion Sources: Toys R Us, Bloomberg Dressed in black pants and a blue long-sleeve shirt — a deliberate attempt to connect with store workers by wearing their uniform — Brandon then walks through a display of Pokémon toys, snapping pictures of empty shelves with his iPhone that he’ll send to one of his executives. It’s Friday afternoon before the crucial weekend rush.

There hasn’t been much to smile about at Toys R Us. More than a decade after a $7.5 billion leveraged buyout by Bain Capital, KKR & Co. and Vornado Realty Trust, the retailer remains saddled with annual interest payments approaching $500 million and no clear path for its owners to exit the investment. The company registered for an initial public offering in 2010, only to withdraw it a few years later. Since the buyout, Amazon.com — which once ran the Toys R Us website until the two companies’ partnership failed in 2006 — has become a powerful competitor. And shoppers are abandoning the suburban malls that helped make the big-box pioneer one of the most dominant retailers of the 1980s and 1990s. Brandon, who oversaw a turnaround at Domino’s Pizza last decade, knows he has no easy task. For years, the Wayne, N.J.-based toy chain has bought time by refinancing its debt, which now totals about $5 billion. It did so again last month with a swap that pushed out maturities on notes due in 2017 and 2018 by five years. While Brandon’s first year has brought signs of progress, with holiday sales gaining for the first time in four years, the debt deal wasn’t necessarily a full vote of confidence because many investors had bought the bonds at distressed levels and made a profit. But it did buy Brandon more time — probably the next two Christmas seasons — to turn the company around. Empty shelves Back in the Secaucus store, Brandon is looking over several empty shelves. He ticks off a list of retail basics, such as improved inventory management, that are sorely needed. Then he boils down the company’s woes to one fundamental problem: The experience needs to be more fun. The big-box advantages of selection and price that made the format so successful have been obliterated by the web. There needs to be more reasons for people to go to a store. “The biggest change you are going to see over the next year is that we want to bring our toy stores to life,” Brandon says. “I want kids to be dragging their parents to our stores because they want to see what’s going on at Toys R Us this weekend.” How well Brandon’s strategy works may say a lot about the future of specialty retailing. If any big-box chain can transform itself into an experiential destination, it’s Toys R Us. The retailer has a huge inherent advantage — kids already love the place.  It will be a massive undertaking. The company has almost 600 stores in the U.S. and 700 more overseas. It still racks up almost $12 billion in annual sales — about 10 percent from the internet — and employs 62,000 workers. The retailer generates more revenue than Under Armour, Lululemon Athletica and Chipotle Mexican Grill combined. Brandon’s plan is under way in the run-up to the holiday season, when the retailer generates 40 percent of its revenue and all its operating income. Whether it’s letting shoppers fly drones or take target practice with a Nerf blaster, all the changes Toys R Us is implementing or considering recall an era when retail was more theater than science. Apple is doing it well today, and Brandon says Toys R Us can do the same. The company is also testing video screens, sound effects and colorful motion-sensor lights, and unboxing more toys in play areas. It’s also hosting more events, such as Pokémon trading and birthday celebrations. “I want kids to come in here and not know where to go next because there are so many things going on,” says Brandon, who has seven young grandchildren. Toys R Us is also doing more to highlight major brands. Mattel’s American Girl will have its own department with dedicated staff. The chain is revamping how it treats Barbie, Mattel’s biggest line, by putting everything it sells for the brand in one place. The retailer used a similar strategy last Christmas for Star Wars. Cash has been a concern since the 2005 buyout, making it harder for Toys R Us to invest in its stores. Brandon says the retailer has the resources it needs and will keep capital expenditures where they’ve been, at about $250 million a year. In addition to the debt swap, Toys R Us is working with lenders on refinancing $725 million in real-estate-backed debt due in December 2017. The company has bought itself about 20 months before it needs to have a plan in place for $1.2 billion in loans due in 2019, according to Noel Hebert, a senior U.S. credit analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Similar situation Brandon has been in a similar spot before. In 1999, he became CEO of debt-laden Domino’s, which had recently been acquired by Bain for about $900 million. In an 11-year reign, he took the company public after boosting sales and profit, and led a bold and successful marketing campaign in 2009 that admitted that Domino’s pizza tasted awful. The company, where Brandon remains chairman, has a market value of $7 billion. Now Bain Capital has turned to Brandon once again. Joining Toys R Us returns the executive to running a large company and gives him a chance at redemption after a rocky tenure in his most-recent stint. In the early 1970s, Brandon played on the defensive line for the University of Michigan football team under legendary football coach Bo Schembechler. It was Schembechler who then served as a reference for Brandon when he landed a job after graduation at Procter & Gamble. After Domino’s, he returned to his alma mater as athletic director in 2010. In one of the few setbacks of his career, Brandon resigned less than four years later amid a string of bad publicity, including raising student ticket prices. At Toys R Us, Brandon’s growth plan includes obvious strategies like boosting online sales, which hit $1.3 billion last year. He also wants to open more stores. And not just in a fast-growing economy like China, but also in the U.S. with smaller locations — some about a quarter the size of a typical 40,000-square-foot unit — designed for New York and other cities it abandoned over high rent. “When it comes to all those millennials who want to live in those urban centers, we’re nowhere,” Brandon says. So far, the chain’s suppliers are on board, says Isaac Larian, the CEO and founder of toymaker MGA Entertainment. Early on, Brandon made the rounds visiting manufacturers and impressed Larian with a willingness to hear the unvarnished truth about the retailer. “He’s not a B.S. type of guy,” said Larian, whose company is best known for its Bratz dolls. “He doesn’t have a big ego.” Toymakers, of course, have every reason to be rooting for him. The nightmare scenario is that if Toys R Us fails, MGA and larger competitors like Mattel and Hasbro would be left at the mercy of mass merchants like Wal-Mart and Amazon, which drive down prices. “The toy business needs to have an anchor in the mind of the consumer,” Larian said. “If no Toys R Us, no toy business.” Bloomberg reporter Jodi Xu Klein contributed to this report.

Investors are on a tightrope walk between risk and low returns Credit: Getty Images Laura Suter 24 September 2016 • 7:02am Investors are now paying to hold a third of the debt issued by developed market governments, and yet yields continue to fall – even where they are already negative. Bonds, for generations a staple holding in a mixed portfolio, in many cases now guarantee owners a modest loss. They also pose the risk of a potentially large capital loss, leading to some of the biggest fans of these assets warning savers to sell up and switch into cash. Negative yields on bonds (see boxout) arise because low interest rates have forced investors to chase yield, driving up the prices of income-generating assets and in turn crushing their yields.    The extremity of the markets – the decision in America to hold interest rates depressed yields further on Thursday – has led to some of Britain’s biggest bond owners turning sour on the sector. Why bond yields can turn negative Richard Woolnough, who runs the £15.5bn M&G Optimal Income fund, told investors that falling bond yields meant fixed-income assets had lost their advantage over cash (his comments are below).  Mr Woolnough said that until recently bonds held their edge over cash because the income on offer compensated investors for the potential capital losses. However, with bonds now offering minimal or no income, that risk of capital loss has become too great.  It’s not the first time a feted bond fund manager has warned on market conditions. Three years ago bond fund manager Chris Bowie, who then ran money for fund group Ignis and is now at TwentyFour Asset Management, warned investors to sell. At the time, his warning was based on bonds’ failure to yield more than inflation. Today, although inflation has fallen, the situation is worse – with many of the same bonds yielding nothing or less than nothing. Professional investors have increased their cash levels as the risks of bonds are not paying off Cash is the answer for many professional portfolio managers, with cash positions reaching levels unseen since the period after Lehman crash in 2008, according to the latest of regular surveys by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. When quizzed on why cash levels were high, fund managers said they had a bearish view on markets and prefer cash over low-yielding equivalents.  What’s more, 82 per cent of the managers believe bonds issued by developed markets are too high. But the problem is spreading out into other assets, as investors crowd into high-quality stocks, US and European corporate bonds and emerging market bonds.  So what does this mean for individual investors? The yield squeeze and your portfolio  Mike Deverell, investment manager at Equilibrium Asset Management, said the current market means the traditional investment model of 60pc stocks and 40pc fixed income – quality bonds – is “dead”. He has reduced equity and fixed income exposure in his portfolios and built up cash.  Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity, the fund manager and broker, said that around $13 trillion of government bonds are now offering negative interest rates, a “pretty extraordinary state of affairs”. “It is fair to say government bonds at today’s prices are very unattractive,” he said. “Why would you lend money knowing you’re going to get a negative return? In large parts of the market you are getting close to zero or negative yields. For an everyday investor what is the point, particularly as they are going to pay a fee on top of that for a fund?” The only reason an investor would hold these bonds is if they believe in the “greater fool theory”, said Mr Stevenson: “Buying bonds at these prices only makes sense if someone else will pay an even higher price than you, and that doesn’t seem like a very prudent basis for an investment.”  But with Bank Rate at 0.25pc and possibly set to fall further, and savings accounts offering next to nothing, cash is not appealing.  “I think as a short-term solution it makes sense but as long-term move cash absolutely doesn’t make sense,” said Stevenson.  Follow us for more investing ideas: @TelegraphInvest  Put an investing question to our experts: moneyexpert@telegraph.co.uk  Instead, investors have two options: accept lower returns or move up the risk spectrum.  Lee Robertson, chief executive of wealth manager Investment Quorum, said investors have to “reset” their expectations of the kind of investment world we are living in.  Corporate bonds, although riskier than those issued by governments, can offer better returns, but only in pockets of the market. The hunger for yield has now filtered through into the corporate bond market, too, and some corporate bonds from blue-chip companies are trading at negative yields – just like the government debt of developed economies. This has been made worse in Europe by the European Central Bank’s programme of buying corporate bonds as part of its “quantitative easing” programme, a move the Bank of England is now following.  “Negative rates have stretched out into corporate bonds, and some of the stronger companies are issuing debt close to 0pc, but those aren’t widespread and corporate bonds still look attractive generally,” said Adrian Lowcock of Architas. Unilever, the company behind household brands such as Persil, Walls and Hellmans, has issued a bond paying no income; while bonds from companies such as healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson and industrial company General Electric already have negative yields.  One way to navigate this is to use strategic bond funds, where managers have the resources and time to adequately research the parts of the market that are paying a decent income, advisers say. “We like strategic bond funds,” said Mr Deverell, “which target higher yield corporate bonds and are safer. You can get 4pc to 5pc distribution, which is a lot better than you get from government bonds.”  Strategic bond fund managers Jenna Barnard and John Pattullo, from investment house Henderson, say returns are certainly harder to find However, Jenna Barnard and John Pattullo, managers of the £1.7bn Henderson Strategic Bond fund, have warned investors to expect lower yields across the market.  Mr Pattullo warned investors will continue to get income from bonds, but that ”capital gains from here is getting a lot more challenging”.  Opportunities for income – where they remain Away from bond market, investors who are willing to take on more risk can still find returns. “Bond proxy” companies, the likes of Unilever and Proctor & Gamble, “still offer a higher and sustainable dividend income,” said Mr Stevenson.  “Equity income remains pretty attractive. In many cases you have got blue chip companies offering higher income on their equity than the bonds they issue, so equities are a better hunting ground for income than bonds,” he said.  Unilever, for example, currently yielding 2.7pc, has increased its quarterly payouts this year so far. These companies are protected against any potential downturns, as they have solid repeat business, said Mr Lowcock. “But if the economy grows more aggressively than it has been doing, then ‘bond proxies’ don’t tend to do so well.”  I am kissing every frog that is coming through the doorMike Pinggera, Sanlam FOUR Equity income funds are one way for investors to access a range of these companies in one place. Mr Robertson said the Newton Global Higher Income fund and investment trusts, such as City of London, were currently offering good yields.  Despite recent scares over property funds, which saw a number of “open-ended” commercial property funds preventing withdrawals amid panic after the Brexit vote, opportunities remain in the property sector for decent yield.  Mr Deverell has made a “small allocation” to the Kames Property Income fund, which is currently yielding 5.75pc and is 9pc cheaper than before the referendum. The fund also has no allocation to London property – an area Mr Deverell thinks is more prone to devaluation.  “Don’t discount property,” said Mr Robertson, who is invested in the F&C Commercial Property trust. “It has had a bit of a rocky time but it seems to be coming back.”  Other areas where Mike Pinggera, manager of the Sanlam FOUR multi-asset fund, is unearthing income, include infrastructure, renewable energy and student accommodation. In the infrastructure space he has moved into the HICL Infrastructure trust and 3i Infrastructure, which are yielding 4.5pc and 3.8pc respectively. “Real assets produce an income immediately but with long-term linkage to inflation,” he said.  “I think it is a challenge for everybody, there is no doubt about it. Generating returns will remain a task,” Mr Pinggera said.  “I do think that it is right to expand investment horizons. You can make incremental increases to the yield of the overall investment portfolio by taking small positions in different things and collectively push up income,” he said.  However, Pinggera, who said he is “kissing every frog that is coming through the door” in a bid to find yield, says he is not yet moving into newer areas, such as peer-to-peer lending.

We want to see more of the world, together, while we can still explore on foot. My dear mother is very elderly and bedridden. She needs more company to brighten her remaining days,” shared Moutrie. “Of course, it’s hard to part. My clients, co-workers and this wonderfully engaged community will always have a special place in my heart.” Moutrie was appointed to her position in December of 1993.  Under the City Charter, she is responsible for advising the Council and other City officers and representing the City and its employees in all civil matters. She attends meetings of the City Council and local bodies, approving the form of contracts, drafting ordinances and resolutions, prosecuting misdemeanors and otherwise enforcing local laws. She also appoints the deputy attorneys and support staff needed to fulfill these responsibilities. This large body of work is handled by the office’s 42 members, comprised of 24 full-time attorneys and 18 support staffers.  Each year, their work includes thousands of criminal cases and hundreds of complaints from consumers, tenants and code enforcement personnel.  They defend the City and its workers in an average of about 200 civil matters in the state and federal trial and appellate courts.  The cases range in complexity from straight forward trip and fall claims to civil rights and employment claims to complex constitutional challenges to City laws and policies.  They also prepare or review thousands of contracts, leases and licenses, draft dozens of ordinances, provide advice at countless public and staff meetings, provide training to various groups and constantly monitor public process and transparency issues and conflict issues. “For over two decades, our City has been extremely fortunate to have Marsha leading our legal work. The combination of her deep knowledge of the law, commitment to our complex community and her savvy leadership, has helped shape the vibrant, innovative and diverse city we have today,” said Mayor Tony Vazquez. “We have all benefitted from her absolute dedication to the public process. She will be missed.” As with other areas of the City’s work, the City’s legal work often includes unique issues and challenges.  “I am proud of the work the office has done over the years to promote community welfare by effectuating Council’s laws and policies, including those relating to housing, tenants’ rights, homelessness, consumer protection, and land use, among others,” said Moutrie.  “Like the City as a whole, the office takes on big   million from the major oil companies and other polluters. We did the legal work to defeat a state take back of about $200 million in redevelopment funds, preserving it for meeting local needs. We drafted and defended laws that promote affordable housing and ensure shared use of our treasured public space, and those laws were adopted as models by other cities. These are just a few examples of how this team has earned its state- wide reputation of outstanding legal work.” Some of the most notable accomplishments of the City Attorney’s Office since 1994 include: Litigated against major oil companies who polluted City wells with MTBE; advanced legislation that caused statewide, and later national, phase out of MTBE; recovered $275 million from all major oil companies; later recovered and additional $108 million for PCP/TCE contamination of groundwater by Boeing and Gillette/Proctor and Gamble. The City Attorney’s Office received the ABA State and Local Government Achievement Award, recognizing best public law office in the country for this work. (City of Santa Monica v. Shell)  Only city attorney’s office in the country to challenge deceptive practices in the bullion/gold sales industry; recovered $10 million for victims.  Drafted and successfully defended a law regulating events in public spaces for the purpose of ensuring reasonable, shared use; it was challenged on First Amendment grounds, upheld in federal court and became a model for other cities. (Santa Monica Food Not Bombs v. City of Santa Monica)  Drafted and defended the Affordable Housing Production Program law. That law became a model for other cities. Performed transactional work necessary to produce over 1900 affordable units.  Recovered a total of $2.5 million for consumers in four recent cases challenging unfair billing and other unfair practices of businesses selling goods and services within the City. Litigated through the California Supreme Court Harris v. City of Santa Monica, which changed California reemployment discrimination law.  Lawyers representing both sides were jointly given California Lawyer of the Year Award. Protected Tenants rights by drafting, defending and enforcing local laws, e.g., laws prohibiting harassment and requiring relocation payments. (Action Apartment v. City of Santa Monica)  Protected the beach/ocean, public health and the environment by drafting and publicizing laws against smoking and use of reusable plastic bags.  Protected low wage immigrant workers against wage violations by car washes; recovered $656,000 in back wages.  Preserved public property for public benefit through resolution of long-standing beach encroachment disputes with private owners through negotiation and litigation.  (City of Santa Monica v. Ornstein)  Protected local quality of life in residential neighborhoods by prosecuting clubs that fail to observe noise limitations and other local regulations.  Drafted, successfully defended and enforced laws that address impacts of homelessness (Doucette v. City of Santa Monica).  Helped establish and operate Homeless Court as a diversion program to help persons long homeless in the community to get off the streets; program has permanently housed 70 persons. Worked to break the cycle of violence by prioritizing prosecution of domestic violence cases, prosecuting them vertically, and working closely with local serve providers to aid victims. Provided all legal work necessary to support City’s various public works and public programs, e.g., Main Library, Pico Branch Library, Virginia Avenue Park, Annenberg Beach House, Tongva Park, Expo Light Rail,  Esplanade, California Incline,  programs for seniors and youth, after-school programs, senior programs, arts programs, after-school programs, and human services grants. Drafted and successfully defended against constitutional challenge laws that regulate street performance and street vending in order to respect individual rights while protecting shared enjoyment and aesthetics of public space. (Lamle v. City of Santa Monica)  Successfully resolved difficult and lengthy dispute involving religious displays in a public park through ordinance drafting and litigation. (Santa Monica Nativity Scenes Committee v. City of Santa Monica) “Losing Marsha Moutrie, even into her well-earned retirement, which we knew was inevitable, is a challenging transition for our City,” said Councilmember Kevin McKeown. “I’m grateful we enjoyed her excellent leadership for so many years, and grateful she leaves us such a highly skilled and motivated staff of attorneys to continue handling our legal workload while we seek a replacement. We will find a new City Attorney, but never another Marsha Moutrie.” The Council is expected to begin its search for a new City Attorney next week.   Post a comment Name E-Mail City Comments Comments Comments Advertise With Us For the best in Santa Monica advertising opportunities, click here!

An exception was Twitter, which surged 21.4 percent following reports it is in talks with potential acquirers, including Google and Salesforce.com. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.7 percent to 18,261.45. Twitter shares soared after CNBC reported that the microblogging service is in talks with potential acquirers including Google and Salesforce.com ©Leon Neal (AFP/File) The broad-based S&P 500 declined 0.6 percent to 2,164.69, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.6 percent to 5,305.75. Google parent Alphabet ended unchanged, while Salesforce dropped 5.6 percent after both were reported to have shown interest in buying Twitter, which has struggled to build on the growth momentum of its early years. Apple fell 1.7 percent on speculation that iPhone sales have been disappointing, while Facebook lost 1.6 percent on concerns about its online advertising prospects after it acknowledged that it had previously counted cases of users watching for as few as three seconds. Oil-linked stocks retreated, with petroleum prices, as Halliburton shed 1.9 percent and ConocoPhillips declined 2.6 percent. Analysts said the market was due for a pullback after the Nasdaq finished at records the last two days following the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates low. Michael James, managing director of Wedbush Securities, said the market is torn between the threat of weak third-quarter earnings and belief that the Fed's easy-money policies will propel stocks even higher. He predicted more volatility, saying "it depends which of those views takes hold on a daily basis." Dow member Procter & Gamble fell 1.4 percent following a report from Bloomberg News that said P&G brands in skin care and men's shaving were losing US market share to competitors. Yahoo sank 3.1 percent following the Thursday disclosure that hackers took data on at least 500 million users, one of the biggest thefts of personal data ever. Marriott International shed 1.9 percent after announcing it completed its $13.6 billion takeover of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide.

The Magazine Antiques Home Articles News & Opinion Directory Calendar The Store Archive That was another country By James Gardner  |  Notes on Photographs by Larry Silver, 1949–1955 at the New-York Historical Society. Precisely because photography is thought to be the most objective of all mediums, it acquires over the course of years, and seemingly in spite of itself, a haunted quality that no other product of visual culture can claim to the same degree. Fig. 9. Leaving Penn Station, 1952. Gelatin silver print 12 by 12 3/4 inches.   The forty-five photographs by Larry Silver that are now on view at the New-York Historical Society are a case in point. When Silver made these images between 1949 and 1955 he was a teenager. The last thing on his mind, one imagines, was to capture the mood or spirit or atmosphere of New York City in the immediate aftermath of World War II. Though beautiful, precocious, and often self-conscious works of art, these photographs seem to aspire to a no-nonsense objectivity fully in keeping with the spirit of the age, with its bullying virility, its pervasive slang, and its working-class mystique. We are in the age of Sinatra here rather than of Rudy Vallee. Click Image to View More Born in the Bronx in 1934, Larry Silver was mentored, while still in high school, by Lou Bernstein and other members of the so-called Photo League who frequented the Peerless Camera Store on East 44th Street. He won a scholarship to the Art Center School in Los Angeles, where he shot a distinguished series of photographs of the body builders along Santa Monica's Muscle Beach. In 1959 he moved back to New York and established himself as a highly successful advertising photographer, whose clients have included American Express, IBM, and Procter & Gamble. In the present exhibition, Silver documents New York City at a crucial instant in its evolution; it stood at the summit of its postwar triumph. In all but the most literal sense, New York was the capital of the United States at the moment when it became the most powerful nation in human history. To a greater degree than ever before or after, New York was the undisputed center of art and literature and music, of industry and leisure, of modernity itself. In one photograph children play beside a construction site that is on its way to becoming the United Nations (Fig. 1), the very embodiment of the postwar world. In another, we experience the quieter charms of New York, as two women rest beside the sparkling waters of the lake in Central Park. An image of Times Square, whose barrage of signage includes a multistory poster of Bette Davis in Dark Victory, beautifully depicts New York in its role as a center of popular culture (Fig. 4). 1 2 3 Next Page » Email To: From: Message: Share This Media Digg Facebook Delicious LinkedIn Print | Email | Share ARTICLES RSS FEED Thank you for signing up.

I would be spending more time on these areas,” he said. The company, which clocked annual revenue of around Rs 3,000 crore ($450 million) in financial year 2015-16, generates about 51 per cent of its business from three verticals — process engineering, industrial products and medical devices. Its top 30 clients are Fortune 500 companies, including Eaton, BMW, Rockwell Automation, P&G, Shell, UTC, John Deere and Calsonic Kanseer. According to L&T Group Chairman A M Naik, the company is targeting a 15 per cent increase in revenue to $525 million (around Rs 3,502 crore) in the current financial year and wants to double revenue to $1 billion over the next three-four years. Remaining bullish about demand and growth, Panda said the company will grow more than the industry. The global engineering addressable market is about $365 billion (around Rs 24.35 lakh crore), of which only $67 billion (about Rs 4.46 lakh crore) has been tapped. The Indian engineering, research and development services market, which reached $20 billion in 2015, is expected to touch $38 billion (about Rs 2.53 lakh crore) by 2020, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 13.7 per cent. The other important area that the company plans to continue investing in is innovation and talent acquisition. “Innovation depends on our young engineers. Right now, we have 9,400 employees, I started with 1,400 (in 2010) and we have added about 8,000 engineers over five years, more engineers than what L&T has,” he said. The company made its stock market debut at Rs 920 per share, seven per cent more than its issue price of Rs 860. The Rs 894-crore issue, which opened for subscription between September 12 and 15, was subscribed 2.52 times.

Jordan Wathen (TMFValueMagnet) Sep 23, 2016 at 6:05AM Image source: Getty Images. The best dividend ETF should pay a high yield from a diversified portfolio of dividend stocks while offering the potential for investors to earn additional returns from capital appreciation. To that end, here's a list of what I believe to be the five best dividend ETFs out of more than 100 dividend ETFs on the market today: Dividend ETF Ticker Annual Expense Ratio Dividend Yield (SEC Yield) Type Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF VIG 0.09% 2.1% Dividend Achievers Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF VYM 0.09% 3.1% Diversified mid- and large cap stocks Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF SCHD 0.07% 3.1% Quality large cap stocks SPDR S&P Dividend ETF SDY 0.35% 2.4% Dividend aristocrats WisdomTree SmallCap Dividend Fund DES 0.38% 3.1% Small cap Sources: Vanguard, Charles Schwab, State Street Global Advisors, WisdomTree. Before buying any of these, it's important to know how the funds work. Here's the case for each fund, and why each one deserves a spot in the list of the best dividend ETFs for an income portfolio. Vanguard's dividend Goliath The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF lays claim to being the largest dividend ETF, with assets of more than $22.5 billion. It's not hard to see why this fund is so popular, given its tiny annual expense ratio of 0.09% of assets and a focus on high-quality dividend-paying companies. This isn't your average dividend ETF. The fund tracks the NASDAQ US Dividend Achievers Select Index, which invests in companies that have paid increasing dividends for at least 10 consecutive years, excluding REITs and master limited partnerships. The index uses proprietary and undisclosed screening mechanisms to sort out the top companies from a broader dividend index. Broadly diversified, the fund held 185 different mega and large-cap companies at the time of this writing, with its largest stakes in popular dividend stocks such as Johnson & Johnson, Microsoft, and PepsiCo. But keep in mind that this fund is focused primarily on capital appreciation over income. The fund's investments had an average yield of just 2.1% at the time of this writing, putting the ETF's yield roughly in line with the S&P 500. What makes this fund so attractive to investors is that it has roughly matched the return of the S&P 500 while investing in companies with rock-solid dividend policies. In addition, a focus on blue-chip stocks with the capacity to grow their dividends resulted in less pain during the Great Financial Crisis, when the fund lost much less of its value than the stock market on average. Vanguard's simple yield ETF What would happen if you took a list of high-yield large cap stocks, sorted it by dividend yield, and then invested in the highest-yielding half? Well, you'd get something that looks a lot like the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF. The strategy isn't particularly fancy, but it works. The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, which invests in the highest-yielding of U.S. stocks in the FTSE All-World Index, excluding only REITs. The fund weights each stock by market cap, thus investing most heavily in dividend-paying large-cap companies. Despite its simplicity, returns have been excellent, beating the S&P 500 marginally over the most recent three- and five-year periods, largely because of outsize dividend yields. At the time of this writing, the fund offered a yield of about 3.1%, roughly 50% more than the S&P 500. Note that this is one of the most diversified ETFs on the list -- it holds more than 420 stocks -- yet it carries an annual expense ratio of just 0.09% a year. That's a very low price to pay to get broad diversification across dividend stocks in every sector. Schwab's fundamentally focused dividend ETF A late entrant into exchange-traded funds, Charles Schwab has rapidly attracted assets with its low-cost ETFs. The Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF is no exception, boasting a microscopic 0.07% annual expense ratio that makes it the least expensive of any fund on this list. The prominent feature of this fund is that its methodology is designed to select from the very best of dividend-paying stocks. The ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which invests in large-cap stocks that have paid dividends annually for the past 10 years. Importantly, the index also considers fundamental metrics in stock selection, requiring that companies have high cash flow to debt, earn a high return on equity, offer a generous dividend yield, and have a history of dividend growth. Like other ETFs on this list, it excludes bond-like companies such as real estate investment trusts, which offer high yields but less opportunity for capital appreciation. This fund favors large-cap stocks, because of its market-cap weighting. The top three holdings are Intel, Procter & Gamble, and Microsoft, common companies in any high-quality portfolio. Its 3.1% yield stands out as one of the highest, but note that it isn't as diversified as other funds, as it holds only 100 different stocks. State Street's royal dividend ETF After a company increases its dividend for 25 consecutive years, it joins an elite group of stocks known as "dividend aristocrats." The SPDR S&P Dividend ETF invests in these companies by tracking the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes companies that have consistently increased their dividends for 20 years in a row. Relaxing the requirement to 20 years of dividend increases from 25 years doesn't necessarily cost much in the way of portfolio quality, but it does allow for a little more diversification. (A stricter dividend aristocrats ETF sponsored by ProShares holds just 50 stocks.) Note that this ETF held 108 stocks at the time of this writing and was most heavily invested in traditional high-yield sectors including utilities, financial services, and industrials.  State Street's ETF is a little different in that it weights stocks in the portfolio by their indicative yield. Thus, a stock that has a dividend yield of 5% will make up a bigger part of the portfolio than a stock that yields just 3%, for example. The result is that the fund tends to invest more heavily in slower-growing companies that return more of their income to shareholders. At the time of this writing, its three largest holdings were HCP Inc., People's United Financial, and Caterpillar. (Its largest holding, HCP, is a REIT, which would be excluded from many other ETFs on this list.) Performance has been spectacular, as the ETF has put up annualized returns that were about 0.5 percentage points better than the S&P 500 over the last five- and 10-year periods. This is especially impressive when you consider that the ETF carries a much higher annual expense ratio (0.35%) than other dividend ETFs. With a current yield of about 2.4%, the fund has a slight advantage over the S&P 500's 2.1% yield. WisdomTree's fund for big yields from small stocks Most dividend ETFs focus on large companies and completely ignore high-yield small caps. WisdomTree's SmallCap Dividend Fund is a great way to round out a dividend portfolio so that it includes dividend payers of all sizes, not just megacap companies. This fund selects stocks by ranking all dividend-paying stocks by size and then throwing out the largest 300 stocks, as well as stocks with market caps of less than $100 million, which can be impractical for some funds to own. The largest companies that make up 75% of the remaining companies' total market cap are put into WisdomTree's large and mid-cap dividend ETFs. The smallest companies, which make up 25% of the value of the list, are put into the WisdomTree SmallCap Dividend Fund. WisdomTree weights stocks in the portfolio by the total dollar amount of dividends it expects a company to pay over the next year. The result is a diversified portfolio of about 700 different investments, many of which won't be familiar to investors who primarily stick to American large caps. Targa Resources (oil and gas services), Cal-Maine Foods (egg farmer and distributor), and Covanta Holding Corp. (waste disposal) were the three largest companies in its portfolio. Small caps typically generate higher returns, albeit with more volatility, than large-cap stocks. It's notable that the WisdomTree SmallCap Dividend Fund has beaten the returns of stock indexes large and small, trouncing both the S&P 500 (large caps) and Russell 2000 (small caps) over the most recent five- and 10-year periods. It also pays out a much higher dividend yield of about 3.1% vs. about 1.6% for the Russell 2000 and 2.1% for the S&P 500. If there is one big downside, it's that the ETF leans toward the costly side. An annual expense ratio of 0.38% is cheap compared with active funds, particularly active small-cap funds, but it is the highest of any ETF on this list. That said, if the fund's forward returns look anything like its historical returns, investors will find it easy to look past higher expenses.    Jordan Wathen has no position in any stocks mentioned.

However, audiences are no longer a given. Publishers and advertisers need to meticulously tailor their content to survive in the cutthroat media terrain. Disruption in our industry is the norm The internet is maturing and evolving at an unprecedented speed. Disruption is the norm and advertisers need to react with agility and intuition. While traditional online display advertising still makes a profit, rising challenges such as banner blindness among readers are limiting its effectiveness. Native advertising, content marketing and/or remarketing are climbing the ranks as real options to make money from a publishers’s digital audience. The emergence of ad blocking A key issue on the global digital advertising agenda is ad blocking. While ad blocking is still in it’s infancy and relatively low in South Africa, it does hold the potential to impact the ability for advertisers to achieve the laser point ‘holy grail’ of ‘right message, right person, right time’ and of course, more recently, ‘right device’. This has a bearing on actual acquisition costs and efficiency. As marketing is driven by cost per acquisition, ad blocking limits audience reach, regardless of what platform they are using. A united front to counter ad blocking As a global organisation, the IAB is spearheading the digital advertising industry’s reaction to this phenomenon. On September 15 2016, the Coalition for Better Ads was announced in Cologne, Germany, at the Dmexco conference. In addition to the IAB, founding members include heavyweights such as Google, Facebook, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, the 4As, the Association of National Advertisers, the World Federation of Advertisers, The Washington Post and GroupM. Using technology currently being developed at the IAB’s Tech Lab, the consortium aims to monitor digital ad campaigns, scoring them on everything from creative to load time. Standards will be set using data gleaned from the system as well as from consumer feedback and input from marketers. As IAB CEO Randall Rothenberg says, it is critical that, as an industry, we create standards that ensure that consumers get safe, fast, secure delivery of the sites and services they love. So far, ad blocking has been less of a challenge in our ‘mobile-first’ context. That does not mean that South African publishers do not need to prepare for ad blocking as they grow their digital presence and audiences. Rather, the idea that global audiences feel led to block out irrelevant advertising should shape what we choose to publish, and how we engage with readers that are becoming increasingly discerning. Ultimately, it’s about great content The internet cannot survive without content. In South Africa, we have reached a crossroads rich in opportunity. While our oldest print and press partners are experiencing challenges, our digital industry is hungry for excellent content. We cannot afford to lose good journalists with years of experience because one segment of the media is struggling. As the IAB SA, we are committed to finding ways to supporting our various member sectors to integrate journalists that can no longer work in the print environment, finding them a place within the digital ecosystem. We aim to turn the disruption within print into dialogue. This speaks to the digital publishing industry’s need to deliver relevant content to their audiences in a seamless manner. This content is created by skilled teams that need to be paid competitive salaries. Therefore, digital advertising needs to evolve in such a way that online teams are able to monetise their business and keep creating great content.  It’s also about getting to know your users We recommend publishers and brands engage more intimately with their users to establish want they will and won’t accept to remain loyal readers and customers. Open up a dialogue with users so they can contribute to the boundaries of their experience of the platform and what will serve them best. Enhance their experience by making it seamless and laser pointed in its relevance to the individual. Humans are more than a set of data points, possessing their own idiosyncrasies and preferences. They are consumers of content, but also consumers of relevant products and services. The right advert addresses an individual need. In this sense, digital advertising should be a welcome diversion and not a rude interruption. If we strike this balance, publishers and ultimately their advertisers will retain, or in some cases win back, the trust of their audiences.

NEW YORK: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Thursday sought preferential trade access to the US market to boost bilateral trade between Pakistan and the United States. "We seek preferential trade access to the US market so that Pakistan and US businesses get a fair chance of doing business with each other. Such an arrangement is necessary to boost bilateral trade," the prime minister said while speaking at a luncheon co-hosted by the US-Pakistan Business Council (USPBC) and the US Chamber of Commerce. He expressed hope that the US Chamber of Commerce and the USPBC would play their role in bringing the two countries closer on this and in convincing the US administration and Congress for its need. "This will go a long way in strengthening the relationship between the two countries, their people and businesses," he added. The prime minister said he firmly believed that a strong trade and economic relationship was an essential pre-requisite for a stable, long-term people to people relations. The United States has remained an important economic and trading partner of Pakistan, he said, adding, this partnership has been beneficial for private businesses of both countries and instrumental in fostering growth in Pakistan. "However, the level of trade and investment between the two countries has not kept pace with global trends," he said and mentioned that recognising this, both President Obama and he agreed in their meeting in October 2013 to jointly work on developing a Joint Action Plan to expand bilateral trade and investment flows over the next five years. "I see tremendous potential to deepen trade, economic and investment cooperation between our two countries. Your role as business leaders, investors and entrepreneurs is critical in enabling our two governments to fully harness the potential," he added. He said turning around the economy, overcoming the energy crisis, combating extremism and terrorism and investing in education have been the key priorities of his government ever since assuming office in June 2013. "I am, therefore, particularly pleased to share with you the details of the progress achieved by Pakistan," he added. The prime minister said as a result of bold economic reforms, his government had achieved significant improvement in all major economic indicators. Pakistan's growth has increased and the budget deficit has been reduced, he added. He said with a young and vibrant population of 200 million, growing consumer demand, as well as a stable economy and improved security, Pakistan offered enormous opportunities for profitable investment and trade. Giving an overview of some of the key economic indicators in Pakistan, the prime minister said inflation is now well below 3% - the lowest in 47 years. The State Bank of Pakistan in its Monetary Policy Decision announced in May 2016 decreased the discount rate to 5.75% - again lowest in last 4 decades, he said, adding that upgradation of the Karachi Stock Exchange to Emerging Market Index by Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) was an important development. The Boeing International Operations and Policy director expressed his desire that Boeing wanted to partner with PIA and was ready to offer 777 and 787 planes for PIA Premier Service through transparent and competitive process. The Proctor and Gamble Selling and Marketing Operations president said that the company has already achieved 20 percent increase in its growth in Pakistan. "We are ready to further invest $100 million in Pakistan." Besides US Chamber executive vice president, senior vice president of US Chamber of Commerce and USPBC president, Pepsi Co vice chairman, Motorolla Solutions senior vice president, APR Energy chairman, Citi Bank vice chairman, Visionnet Systems CEO, EPC executive vice president, Metlife associate general counsel, McLarty Associates senior adviser and Agilvy Public Northrop Grumman CEO were prominent attendees during the occasion.  Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus E-Paper Aaj Kal Sunday Magazine Facebook Daily Times Instagram Twitter Tweets by @DailyTimes_DT SoundCloud sunday magazine aaj kal Business Plus TGIF Zaiqa TV Company Financials Contact us Privacy Policy TERMS AND CONDITIONS © 2016 Dailytimes - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Powered By opustech.co
