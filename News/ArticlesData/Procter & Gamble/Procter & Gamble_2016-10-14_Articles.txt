Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Oct 15, 2016 at 8:28AM Image source: Getty Images. The smartest investors in the world aren't wrong. Dividend investing works, which is fantastic news for investors of all ages and incomes who are saving for retirement. However, constructing a portfolio of the best dividend stocks on the market doesn't happen on its own. So how can you find, buy, and grow your wealth with the top dividend stocks on the market today? Constructing a portfolio of great dividend stocks requires understanding a few key characteristics, including a stock's current dividend yield, dividend growth track record, payout ratio, and more. Dividend investing overview Successful dividend investing isn't necessarily about identifying any single characteristic in a stock. Rather, investors should focus on finding stocks that consistently grow cash distributions in a sustainable way over the long term, and reinvesting those payments. Finding such stocks with a high dividend yield can create a potent compounding machine that has been proven to outperform the market if consistently applied over the long term.  The table below shows five of the top dividend stocks on the market today, which I define as companies with dividend yields over 3% -- about 50% higher than the S&P 500's yield -- and track records of more than 25 years of consecutive annual dividend increases:  Company Name Dividend Yield No. Consecutive Annual Dividend Increases Procter & Gamble 3.0% 59 years Consolidated Edison 3.6% 41 years Coca-Cola Company 3.3% 53 years T. Rowe Price 3.2% 29 years McDonald's 3.0% 39 years Data sources: Dividend.com and Google Finance. However, this only speaks to a few of the most important aspects in selecting the best dividend stocks for your portfolio, so let's dive deeper into a few of the dividend stocks that seem particularly compelling for investors today. Image source: Getty Images. Procter & Gamble's track record of dividend excellence Few companies have established a more impressive dividend history than Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Before delving further into why long-term dividend investors love P&G, here are its three most crucial dividend statistics: Company Name Dividend Yield Years of Consecutive Increases Payout Ratio Procter & Gamble 3.0% 59 76% Data sources: Dividend.com and Yahoo! Finance.  Even if you don't realize it, chances are you encounter at least one brand owned by Procter & Gamble on a daily basis. The company owns 66 consumer products spread across consumer staples categories including home cleaning, laundry, and personal care products. Even more impressive, 22 of P&G's brands each contributed more than $1 billion in sales to the company in 2015.  The company's products tend to enjoy fairly stable demand regardless of the current health of the economy, which is a major reason Procter & Gamble has produced such a steady history of increasing dividend payments. The company has faced headwinds, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in recent years. But it has moved aggressively to cut costs and reinvest those savings into new organic growth initiatives. Analysts are now calling for the green shoots from P&G's turnaround efforts to begin to manifest themselves in coming quarters. Either way, though, a company with P&G's staying power makes it one of the best opportunities for long-term dividend investors on the market today. Image source: Getty Images. T. Rowe Price: a low-profile dividend giant Mutual fund management T.

Rowe Price 3.2% 29 51% Data sources: Dividend.com and Yahoo! Finance.  With $777 billion in assets under management (AUM), T. Rowe Price remains one of the best asset managers in the world. An impressive 80% of T.

Rowe Price the No. 4 ranking on Barron's Top Mutual Fund Families list this year.  Performances like this should help T. Rowe attract new customers over the long term, though the company's quarter-to-quarter performance tends to fluctuate with the stock market for a few reasons. T. Rowe Price generates its revenue from the fees it collects from the various funds it manages. Bull markets bring fat times for T. Rowe as rising asset prices increase its AUM and, thus, the fees it collects. However, uncertain markets or bear markets can have the opposite effect, which we've seen with recent T. Rowe Price earnings reports, though it remains worth noting that the stock market's long-run direction favors growth. Either way, T. Rowe Price manages its business with the utmost conservatism -- it carries zero long-term debt on its balance sheet -- which leaves the company ample cash flow to return to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. Over the past two years, T. Rowe Price has reduced its shares outstanding by nearly 5%. What's more, the company's demonstrated commitment to growing its annual dividend payments makes it another fantastic option for investors interested in building an exceptional long-term dividend portfolio.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Oct 14, 2016 at 3:23PM Image source: Getty Images. Thanks to slight differences in the way it tracks its fiscal year, Unilever (NYSE:UL) usually posts quarterly earnings results a few days ahead of Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), its consumer goods rival. That calendar quirk lets P&G investors get an early look at what they can expect to hear from their own management team about the prevailing industry trends. Unilever this week announced steady sales growth and affirmed its full-year outlook, but there were a few worrying points that suggest P&G might have downbeat news for shareholders when it posts its results on Oct. 25. Volume decline Unilever's organic growth pace fell to 3% from the 5% it enjoyed in each of the prior three quarters. That's not a problem by itself, since the gains were within management's forecast range, and Unilever still believes it will grow at a 4% pace this year. Image source: Unilever investor presentation. Looking deeper into the results reveals a major red flag, though. Unilever's growth came completely from price increases, and organic sales volumes declined overall. UL, like P&G, aims to produce market-beating sales growth that's driven mainly by volume gains. After all, price hikes can't produce consistent, long-run expansion. But the company came up short of that goal in a rare miss this quarter. The biggest bright spot in P&G's last quarterly report was its return to volume growth after more than a year of declines. That rebound helped produce an encouraging sales bounce and is also key to executives' goal of delivering a growth uptick for the full year. That's why a volume drop, if it hits Procter & Gamble, too, might force P&G to lower its outlook later this month. Industry struggles Unilever had nothing but negative comments about the state of consumer goods industry. "Demand remained weak," the company said in a press release, as growth "slowed further."  Management went into more detail in an investor presentation, citing falling consumer confidence, rising commodity costs, and volatile currency exchange rates. Image source: Unilever investor presentation. These are the same factors P&G has been struggling against for a few years now, so the company likely included them in their sales growth outlook for fiscal 2017. Still, P&G might have hoped for at least a flat overall market -- not one that's shrinking. It wasn't all bad news for P&G on this score, though, as Unilever posted a broad uptick in the key U.S. market, which suggests that geography is holding steady even as other areas of the world are slowing. P&G gets a larger chunk of its profits from developed economics like the U.S., so a strong performance there might be good enough to offset weakness in regions like Latin America and Asia. Can P&G surprise investors? P&G and Unilever compete in many of the same product categories and markets. But the overlap doesn't mean that lower results for one company translate into market share gains by the other. Instead, it's much more likely that the challenging selling conditions Unilever is reporting will also be cited by P&G later this month as drivers behind its own low-growth results. P&G shareholders have some encouraging news to look forward to when hearing from management in the next quarterly release, including updates on the company's ramped-up cash return plans and improved marketing spending. They aren't likely to see evidence of strong overall sales volume growth, though, or of an upturn in the broader industry. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Oct 13, 2016 at 8:52PM Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) held its annual shareholders meeting this week at a time when investors are gaining optimism that a business turnaround is about to take hold. The stock is up 20% in the last 12 months as P&G moves into what executives predict will be a year of accelerating growth for the consumer goods titan. Here are the key points management made in its presentation for investors. Image source: Getty. 1. Momentum Image source: P&G investor presentation. P&G is entering the new fiscal year with the wind at its back. Organic sales growth weighed in at 2% last quarter, compared to 1% for the full year. The bad news is that this growth pace still trailed rivals, meaning its market share struggles aren't over. However, its latest gains were driven by volume growth, not just higher prices, which suggests the company has a good shot at finally posting that sales rebound investors have been waiting for. 2. Advertising Image source: P&G investor presentation. P&G is seeing success from its ramped-up spending on advertising. In fact, executives credit a boost in marketing as one of the key factors behind the latest growth uptick. The company has to balance these costs against their potential to accelerate sales growth, though. Core profitability fell by almost 2 percentage points last quarter thanks mainly to the media spending increase. But P&G sees this trade-off as a profitable one over the long term, so the company plans to hike its marketing investments this year despite the fact that it has a much smaller portfolio. 3. Trial products Image source: P&G investor presentation. The marketing budget isn't limited to just TV and online advertising -- it also includes P&G's massive sampling program. Executives are planning to put trials of its new laundry detergent products into 30 million homes this fiscal year, up from 17 million in fiscal 2016. The company has found early success on this score in both its Gillette razors and Pampers diapers franchises by covering a whopping 80% and 70% of its target demographic, respectively. P&G is confident that many of these sampling users will convert into loyal fans of the brand. 4. Cost savings Image source: P&G investor presentation. Management has blown past its original target for cutting costs by $1.2 billion per year, with savings instead averaging $1.4 billion over the past five years. The plan ahead calls for doubling down on these productivity initiatives so P&G saves as much as $2 billion per year over the next five fiscal years, for a total savings of $10 billion by 2021. If it hits these goals, the company should have plenty of funds to direct toward innovation research and marketing budgets while also sending a huge pile of cash back to shareholders, mostly in the form of stock repurchases. 5. Big-picture goals TSR = Total shareholder return. Image source: P&G investor presentation. P&G's overarching operating goal has three parts. Executives aim to grow faster than the market while boosting profitability and producing ever-increasing cash flow. The company made significant progress in the latter two metrics last year, but it fell behind in the hardest, but most important one: organic sales growth. P&G lost market share across most of its product divisions in fiscal 2016 as revenue growth decelerated yet again. Executives are calling for that negative trend to stop in fiscal 2017 as organic growth ticks up to 2% from 1%. Investors are likely to see solid profit gains and greater cash returns in either case, but they'll need to watch organic growth -- especially organic sales volumes -- for evidence that a real turnaround has finally taken hold.

He first encountered them at a friend's house on the back of the toilet, and decided to give them a try. “It’s just a totally different feeling,” he says. “You see what you were leaving behind.” When he moved into an apartment in Chicago with his three best friends after college, Riley stocked wet wipes in the bathroom. It didn’t take long for the guys to have what he calls “the conversation”: They all admitted they were addicted. Once they felt that moist rub, they couldn’t turn back to the brittle chafe of toilet paper. They made a trip to Sam’s Club together to buy wet wipes in bulk. Then they had a second conversation. What if they started a business? What if they created a wet wipe that young men, like themselves, could purchase without feeling embarrassed? “That was when we started looking at the market,” Riley says. “Where is the flushable wipes market at right now? Where is it going?” Dude Wipes was born. The company is a rising star in the flushable wet-wipe world, a multi-billion-dollar industry that took off in the mid-2000s, when companies like Kimberly-Clark and Proctor & Gamble repackaged traditional baby wipes as luxurious adult toilet paper, pre-soaked and cut-down small enough to flush down a toilet. In 2015, personal wet-wipe sales reached an estimated $2.2 billion. Dude Wipes has made a name for itself by using clever and humorous marketing. The company posts a never-ending stream of potty-themed jokes on social media, such as the faux-launch of a limited-edition Pumpkin Spice scent. Riley, now 31, refers to himself as the “Chief Executive Dude.” Collectively, the owners call themselves “the AmbASSadors.” Riley believes that his friends’ camaraderie and sense of humor give Dude Wipes its competitive edge. People seem to agree. In 2013, Dude Wipes won the Nonwovens Industry Visionary Award, an industry-wide honor for the year’s most exciting new product. In 2015, after the AmbASSadors appeared on TV show Shark Tank, the billionaire Mark Cuban became an investor and partner in the company. Dude Wipes is stocked at national chains like Kroger, Meijer, and Target. < PREVIOUS SLIDESLIDE 1 of 5NEXT SLIDE > A package of Dude Wipes (Courtesy of Frank Dick, city of Vancouver) © Provided by Atlantic Media Company But lawsuits are now popping up across the country over use of the word “flushable.” Sewerage authorities claim that flushable wet wipes don’t break apart, and, as a result, are destroying municipal sewer systems. The wipes cluster with congealed food fat to form large blockages known as fatberg—a portmanteau of fat and iceberg. Last year, a 10-ton lump was removed from the London sewer system at a cost of £400,000. Cases have also been reported in Newcastle, Sydney,San Francisco, Miami, New York City, Toronto, and Washington, D.C. In 2015, the Federal Trade Commission pulled a wet wipe by the brand Nice-Pak off the market. Sewerage authorities hope that more regulation is imminent. Dude Wipes, for its part, claims that its wipes are biodegradable and have been tested by “scientist and doctor dudes.” Are those claims true? Can wet wipes be stopped? Or must cities resign themselves to a future of fatberg? * * * Wyoming, Minnesota, is one of the first American cities to take on the flushable-wet-wipe industry. In 2015, the city filed a class-action suit against Proctor & Gamble, Kimberley-Clark, Nice-Pak, and three other wet wipe manufacturers for fraudulently promoting their products as flushable. Dave Torma, a public-works employee in Wyoming, says that the problem picked up in the early 2000s and has gotten worse over the years. After wet wipes are flushed, they exit a house through a lateral pipe that connects to a public sewer system, where sewage pumps ensure that the wastewater flows in the correct direction. But unlike toilet paper, wet wipes fail to disintegrate. They clog the pumps, causing them to break down and redirect stagnant wastewater back toward houses. Sewer systems must be shut down so that the wipes can be manually removed. When the four-foot pumps are lifted for maintenance, “it looks like you’re pulling up Cousin It,” Torma says. In 2008, the industry standard for use of the word “flushable” for wet wipes and other nonwoven products was created by the North American trade organization the Association of Nonwoven Fabric Industries, also known as INDA. As of 2013, to be labeled “flushable,” a wet wipe must pass seven tests that evaluate its ability to disintegrate, biodegrade, and clear household and municipal sewer lines. But there is no penalty or fine if a wet-wipe manufacturer doesn’t comply. The industry is self-regulated, without government oversight. According to the City of Wyoming, INDA’s seven “flushability” tests fail to simulate real-life conditions in a sewer system. One test, the “slosh box” disintegration test, for example, places a wipe in a tank filled with two liters of water that rocks back and forth for 3 hours. The fibers that remain must then be able to pass through a 12.5-millimeter sieve. But a wet wipe often reaches a sewage pump in a couple of minutes, wastewater officials argue. And many sewer systems are not nearly as hard on the wipe as the agitation test. In 2013, Consumer Reports conducted an independent agitation test that none of the leading four wet wipes (Charmin, Scott, Cottonelle, and Equate) could pass. The wipes also failed to break apart after being beaten for 10 minutes in a kitchen stand mixer on the lowest speed. Dave Rousse, the president of INDA, claims that the flushability tests are satisfactory and that the industry sufficiently regulates itself. He says that INDA calls companies whose wipes don’t pass the seven tests and informs them that their product can no longer be labeled flushable. While he sympathizes with Wyoming’s sewage maintenance problem, he considers their lawsuit “misguided.” Their problem, he contends, is caused by consumers flushing baby wipes—which, unlike the new wave of adult wet wipes, are still meant to be thrown in the garbage—and other non-flushable products like tampons, dental floss, and condoms. In July, Proctor & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark, Nice-Pak, and the three other wet wipe manufactures named in the suit requested that the City of Wyoming save and archive all of its clogged sewage for 180 days to be used as evidence. This would amount to collecting and storing hundreds of tons of raw sewage. Last week, the judge ruled that Wyoming must collect, photograph, and videotape a third of all its sewage clogs over the 180-day span, but that it could dispose of the sewage after 7 days. * * * Wyoming is not alone; sewerage authorities across the country are frustrated with INDA’s flushable standard. In 2012, wastewater associations like the Water Environment Federation tried to work with INDA to establish a new, more rigorous standard, but INDA didn’t show a working draft to them until two weeks before publication at the World of Wipes conference in 2013. The sewerage authorities were dismayed to find that the pass/fail criteria was two to three times more lenient than it had been in the previous guidelines, published in 2009. “It’s become clear that the manufacturers are not the people that should be telling us what is acceptable and not acceptable in our sewer systems,” says Rob Villee, the executive director of the Plainfield Area Regional Sewerage Authority, in New Jersey. Villee estimates that wet wipes are costing billions of dollars a year in worldwide maintenance. “This is an international problem,” he says. “This isn’t the United States, this isn’t Canada. It’s England. It’s Spain. It’s Australia. It’s Israel, France.” The international wastewater community, which consists of 15 countries, including the Netherlands, Turkey, Belgium, France, and the United Kingdom, has given up on working with INDA and its European counterpart, EDANA. These countries started working together in 2015, when the International Standards Organization (ISO), a non-government market agency, decided to create an international standard for “flushable.” They were afraid that if they did not band together, INDA and EDANA would once again dictate the terms. The presidents of the various associations email regularly and speak on weekly conference calls. In September, British environmental groups and waste companies publicly condemned wet wipes. Wessex Water, a sewerage company that serves Southwest England, led the charge, reporting that of the 13,000 blockages they unclog every year, two-thirds are caused by wet wipes. They were also the first to publish a newly agreed-upon International Wastewater Position Statement, which calls for a ban on commercial use of the word “flushable.” The Position Statement advocates that only the “3Ps”—pee, poo, and toilet paper—be flushed. Wastewater authorities from the other 15 countries officially signed on.  “Part of the picture, is assessing the environmental concern and weighing it against the societal benefit.” The international wastewater community is now trying to hash out its own flushable standard, with the hope that ISO will adopt it as the international market standard and that the Federal Trade Commission will adopt it as a Green Guide flushable rule. Green Guide rules allow the government to regulate and fine companies for misleading consumers about environmental claims. (The FTC declined to comment on any policy-related questions or to discuss if the wet-wipe industry is currently under review.) * * * Preventing wet wipes from blocking sewers is just one part of the wet-wipe problem.  The wipes also might pose environmental risks, because they’re made from plastics and synthetic cellulosic fibers, some of which are non-degradable. Once flushed, these plastics disintegrate into microplastics, a type of debris that is smaller than five millimeters in length. The particles cluster in aquatic environments with microplastics from other consumer products, such as some cleansers, exfoliants, and toothpastes. Richard Thompson, a marine biology professor and a director of the International Marine Litter Research Unit, believes that wet-wipe microplastics essentially behave like all other microplastics, which have been proven to transport chemicals to wildlife and to harm marine invertebrates. They have also contributed to such environmental disasters as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. “Part of the picture, is assessing the environmental concern and weighing it against the societal benefit,” he says. House paint, for example, contains lead, which poses an environmental concern. But house paint stays on a house for years, whereas a wet wipe is discarded right after use. “To me, [wet wipes are] away from what I’d consider the center-stage direction for responsible use of plastics in society as we go forward,” Thompson says. Not much is currently known about the environmental effects of synthetic cellulosic fibers. Each wet-wipe product is made from a different combination of them, and they all biodegrade at different speeds and have different rates of emission. It will take some time to test all of the various synthetic fibers, and assess how many non-degradable particles they contribute to the aquatic environment. As a conservative position, the wastewater industry does not believe synthetic fibers should be used until more is known. The International Wastewater Position Statement, meanwhile, claims that no product made from plastics or regenerated cellulose should ever be flushed down the toilet. Last August, Dude Wipes failed to pass a field test conducted by the city of Vancouver, Washington. Fourteen different brands of flushable wet wipes were labeled, soaked for a half-hour, then flushed down an 8-inch sewer line. The wastewater engineering team retrieved the Dude Wipes in the city sewer system 3330 feet away from the drop point, along with seven other brands, fully intact. Villee, the Plainfield sewerage authority director, has personally tested Dude Wipes, as well. “They’re not the worst product,” he says. “I’d probably say they’re kind of in the middle of the pack somewhere.” And are they biodegradable? “They are, under certain conditions and temperatures, [but] I don’t think those are the conditions and temperatures that they’re exposed to in the wastewater system,” Villee says. He calls this the “disingenuous part” of the biodegradable label. “Yeah, they’re biodegradable, but when? Ten years from now?”   * * * Last month, Dude Wipes released a new version of its flushable wet wipe, which, according to Riley, now is 100 percent biodegradable and free of microplastics. (The company gets its scientific information from INDA president Rousse, independent consultants, and the science and doctor dudes who work at the product’s manufacturing plant.) Riley scoffs at the notion that the INDA standard is too industry-friendly. He says that a Dude Wipe product once failed INDA’s flushability test, and the AmbASSadors worked hard to ensure that it eventually passed. He couldn’t comment as to why the Dude Wipes failed the Vancouver Field Test, but he is skeptical of non-industry testing. “If you’re not running [the test] with a certified iso-lab, and certain specifications, it gets kind of hard to speak on,” he says. Riley also resists any FTC-enforced definition of flushable. “I don’t necessarily think it’s the worst idea in the world,” he says. “But I’m sure they’d just be working with the industry. The industry would end up creating it anyway. They would just hold the government’s hand the whole time.” The way he sees it, growing pains are to be expected. “The technology can obviously and already arguably is on the same pace as toilet paper,” Riley says. “Who’s to say the technology isn’t going to surpass toilet paper some day and cut down on paper waste altogether?” The Dudes are hard at work on a top-secret video that they hope to release on Black Friday. Riley wouldn’t share many of the details, but he did mention that it will feature “real-life funny scenarios that can happen to any guy.” The goal, he says, is to “show why using Dude Wipes is better than toilet paper.” That, and “to make tons of people laugh across the country about the topic of wiping your ass.” Go to MSN Home More in Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times 7 things you should never do online USA TODAY The world's most valuable stamps Lovemoney 6 Social Security changes coming in 2017 U.S. News & World Report - Money Up Next 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from The Atlantic ‘I Voted for the Wrecking Ball’: Your Pushback The Atlantic Clinton's Popular-Vote Lead Will Grow, and Grow, and Grow The Atlantic Track of the Day: ‘Jimmie Rodgers' Dream’ by Leon Russell and Elton John The Atlantic The Iconic Hillary Clinton The Atlantic The Atlantic View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

The most famous example is North Carolina's so-called HB 2 "bathroom law," which requires people to use the public restroom according to their gender at birth. What many view as common sense, and a safety issue, launched protests and boycotts led by homosexual activists and their corporate allies who accused state leaders of supporting "hate" and "bigotry" against transgenders. A plan to include Procter & Gamble in the effort failed, however, after Northstar Investment Management asked investors to join the effort. Justin Danhof of the National Center for Public Policy Research attended the meeting and calls the conclusion a victory for religious liberty. But that victory is short-lived, he says, because activist investors aided by a dishonest press are still winning, and an anti-religious movement is growing. "And threatening the liberty of millions," Danhof tells OneNewsNow. OneNewsNow reported in a Sept. story that Trillium Asset Managment, an influential international investment company is led by a homosexual CEO who is arm-twisting corporations to punish North Carolina.  But the Northstar proposal on Tuesday was overwhelmingly rejected, with only about six percent of the shares outstanding voting in favor of the proposal. In a related radio interview Wednesday on "Washington Watch with Tony Perkins," Phil Burress of Ohio-based Citizens for Community Values says he was not surprised shareholders rejected the proposal. Proctor & Gamble is not perfect, Burress told Perkins, but he went on to describe how pro-family leaders were invited years ago to sit down with senior management and discuss issues. "The public is with us on these issues," said Burress. "These companies like Target and others are trying to force their values, joining the media to try to force these values on us." "I was proud to help defeat the proposal," says Danhof, who often loses in his confrontation with corporate leaders and shareholders. "And I was proud that the company didn't just accept it, that the executives seemed to understand that this was a fight that frankly they don't belong in." But there are many more powerful corporations involved in the wrong side of that fight, he adds, so there's more work to be done.  We moderate all reader comments, usually within 24 hours of posting (longer on weekends).

When Warren Buffett disclosed information from his own personal tax returns and stomped Donald Trump so skillfully a few days ago, the stories just wrote themselves. Quotes in the article Phillips 66 PSX ▼ 82.22 -0.87 -1.05% Graham Holdings Co GHC ▲ 476.60 +8.00 +1.71% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 59.02 +0.32 +0.55% Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRK.B ▲ 156.92 +0.86 +0.55% Buffett, who has called early and often for tax increases on America’s biggest earners, punched out the tax-dodging Trump for saying during Sunday’s presidential debate that Buffett “took a massive tax deduction” and that he was dodging taxes the same way Trump was. Buffett emerged triumphant. However, if Trump had done some homework, he could have said that Buffett, like Trump himself, has pursued aggressive, money-saving tax strategies. Which, in fact, Buffett has. But Buffett has pursued these strategies not for himself, but for the company he runs: Berkshire Hathaway. In transactions in 2014 and last year, Berkshire did three “cash-rich split-off” transactions that allowed it to end up with lots of cash and assets while avoiding what I estimate to be a total of about $2.5 billion in capital gains taxes. Berkshire did what amounted to complicated trades with three companies whose shares it had owned for years, swapping those holdings for a combination of cash and operating assets. The transactions are treated by the IRS as tax-free trades, rather than sales. For example, Berkshire got $450 million in cash and a business valued at $900 million from Phillips 66 in return for its Phillips 66 shares, which were valued at $660 million in 2012 when ConocoPhillips (a stock Berkshire had bought in 2008) spun off Phillips 66 to Berkshire and its other shareholders. Berkshire did similar stock-for-cash-and-assets swaps with Graham Holdings (former owner of The Washington Post) and Procter & Gamble.© AP Photo/Seth Wenig That ground-breaking program in Colorado? Warren Buffett's family paid for that. By my count, the three transactions that yielded cash and assets were worth $6.2 billion more than Berkshire’s $1 billion total cost for its stock in the companies, which in the case of Graham Holdings dated back more than 40 years. At a combined state and federal tax rate of about 40 percent—there is no special capital gains rate for corporations—selling its holdings in those three companies for cash would have triggered a $2.5 billion tax bill. But because Berkshire (whose shareholders include me) swapped shares for cash and other assets in split-off transactions, it realized major gains but didn’t have to pay gains tax. I’ve previously written about these three transactions, as well as a fourth one that Berkshire did in 2008. I emailed Buffett’s assistant Thursday seeking comment but did not receive a response. I had tried to speak with Buffett about these deals last year, but he said wouldn’t talk with me because he didn’t like the way I had written about a different tax-aggressive transaction that Berkshire was involved in. To wit, that was the 2014 deal in which Berkshire helped Burger King desert to Canada for tax purposes by buying the Canadian-based Tim Horton restaurant chain. A trademark of Buffett’s tax-minimizing deals for Berkshire is buying new issues of preferred stock rather than common stock. That's what happened when General Electric, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs turned up on Buffett’s doorstep seeking both capital and Buffett’s imprimatur during and after the financial crisis. Dividends, you see, are partly tax-free for corporate recipients, even though they’re generally fully taxable for individuals. I’m not trying to imply that Berkshire’s transactions are either illegal or unethical. They’re not. The point I’m trying to make is that there’s a huge difference between the way Buffett the person handles his personal income taxes and the way Buffett the CEO handles Berkshire’s corporate income taxes. Buffett the person’s tax practices qualify him for sainthood, because among other things, his generous donations of Berkshire stock to charitable causes generate billions of dollars more in tax deductions than he will ever use. Buffett the CEO’s tax practices qualify him … to be a CEO, trying to maximize profits for his shareholders. His behavior is much better than Trump’s, because Berkshire is highly profitable and pays substantial income taxes. But Buffett the CEO is no saint — and it’s a mistake to think of him as one.

 UPDATE 1-Hershey CEO Bilbrey to retire in July, stay as non-exec chairman Reuters Oct. 14, 2016, 7:37 AM 2,486 facebook linkedin twitter email print (Updates with announcement) By Greg Roumeliotis and Lauren Hirsch Oct 13 (Reuters) - Hershey Co, the chocolate maker that Oreo cookie-maker Mondelez International Inc tried to buy earlier this year, said on Friday that Chief Executive John Bilbrey would retire from his post on July 1. Bilbrey will continue as non-executive chairman of the board following his retirement as president and CEO, Hershey said. The company said it had created a special committee to search for a new chief executive. Reuters reported exclusively on Thursday that Bilbrey was preparing to step down by next summer. The move comes less than three months after the charitable trust that controls Hershey reached a major reform agreement with its overseer, the Pennsylvania attorney general's office, raising questions about its future plans for the company. Bilbrey is stepping down to spend more time with his family, a person familiar with the matter had told Reuters. The company, which is based in the town of Hershey, Pennsylvania, has a market capitalization of around $20 billion. Bilbrey was named CEO of Hershey in 2011, after serving in various senior roles at the company since 2003. He added the position of chairman in 2015. Prior to Hershey, Bilbrey worked for 22 years at consumer company Procter & Gamble Co. Following an initial spurned bid in June, Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld re-approached Bilbrey in August, indicating that Mondelez would be willing to offer $115 a share, Reuters reported at the time. Hershey responded to that offer by stating it would not be willing to enter into deal negotiations for an offer of less than $125 per share, a source said at the time. The Hershey trust was set up by the company's founder over a century ago to fund and run a school for underprivileged children. It holds 81 percent of the company's voting stock, and so a sale is not possible without its approval. About two-thirds of its $12 billion in assets are in Hershey stock. Following a dispute with the Pennsylvania attorney general over its governance policy, the trust in July agreed to expand its board from 10 members to 13, and for five members to resign by year's end. With one trustee having resigned shortly before that agreement, that leaves a total of nine openings. Even if the trust does decide to explore a sale of Hershey, the attorney general can thwart such plans. The trust put Hershey up for sale in 2002, and the attorney general's office successfully petitioned a court to block the offer amid local community protests. Pennsylvania attorney general Kathleen Kane stepped down this summer following a criminal conviction. She was succeeded by her deputy, Bruce Castor, and the post is up for election in November.

The company's shares were up 1.4 percent in premarket trading. Bilbrey will continue as non-executive chairman of the board following his retirement as president and CEO, Hershey said.

Ohio produces less renewable energy than Kentucky. Is that OK? Carrie Blackmore Smith , csmith@enquirer.com 9:34 a.m. EDT October 17, 2016 A look at Ohio's sources of electricity. (Photo: Carrie Blackmore Smith) Story Highlights What did Gov. John Kasich say about this in Texas that got people talking? And, learn where Kasich and Ohio Sen. Bill Seitz stand on climate change. How much of Ohio's electricity is powered by renewable energy? Five percent? Ten? According to the most recent annual report of the U.S. Energy Information Administration, it's 2 percent. In other words, 98 percent of the energy powering Ohio's lights, stoves, air conditioners and so much more is created from nonrenewable sources, like coal and natural gas. Is that OK? And if not, should state government do anything about it? Climate change and fossil fuel dependence are some of the greatest issues of our day, hotly debated during this election season. Now, Ohio's power future is front and center again. Ohio Sen. Bill Seitz, who represents about half of Hamilton County, has suggested a new way forward for the Buckeye State, three months before a freeze on mandatory clean energy regulations is scheduled to be lifted. You see, Ohio passed a law eight years ago – when Democrat Ted Strickland was governor and Republicans controlled both the Ohio Senate and House. The bill required private energy companies to gradually increase the percentage of power created with alternative energies to 25 percent by 2025. In 2014, Republicans altered the rules, lowering the percentage to 12.5 by 2027 and freezing the regulations for two years, while politicians studied the topic. That freeze is scheduled to expire Dec. 31, and the 12.5 percent by 2027 would go into effect. The first benchmark –3.5 percent by the end of 2017 – would need to be met or a company would face fines. Duke Energy, which provides electricity to Southwest Ohio, said it will comply with any mandates but "believes that it would be more beneficial for Ohio to incentivize Ohio utilities to build, own, operate and dedicate to Ohioans renewable energy projects located within the state rather than have the current mandate, which does not accomplish that goal." Seitz, of Green Township, is talking about altering the standards again. But he has a unique adversary – Republican Gov. John Kasich – who has publicly threatened to veto any bill that suspends the standards further, a sentiment that fueled some to call Kasich a moderate option in the presidential primary season. What Kasich would prefer is a bit of a mystery. A few weeks ago, he said "the standards that were set were unrealistic." Did Kasich mean 25 percent by 2025 or 12.5 percent by 2027? The Enquirer asked, but was told by a spokesperson that "the governor has been clear on his position regarding energy standards." Seitz is now suggesting the requirements become voluntary goals for the next three years, along with some other alterations to the law. The senator said he "may make a couple changes before we submit it to the committee" soon after the November election. No surprise, environmentalists and clean energy advocates want standards with teeth – and so do some Republicans and a majority of Ohioans. A Yale University poll released in 2014 reported that 58 percent of adults in Ohio supported requiring utilities to produce 20 percent of electricity from renewable sources. Ohio is behind almost every American state when it comes to the percentage of renewable energy it creates. The United States, as a whole, sits at nearly 14 percent. As for our neighboring states; Indiana generates 5 percent of its electric power from renewables, defined as conventional hydroelectric, wind, solar, geothermal or biomass (organic waste) power. Kentucky is nearing 5 percent, Michigan 8 percent and both Pennsylvania and West Virginia are around 4 percent, according to the 2015 annual figures kept by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. By comparison, California generates 33 percent of its electricity from renewable energies. The costs and health risks related to climate change and the pollution created by burning fossil fuels are something more and more companies, universities and government entities recognize and want to change, said Steve Melink, owner of Melink Corp., in Clermont County's Union Township. His company builds solar power and geothermal heating and cooling systems and also sells products and services that add energy efficiency to commercial kitchens and homes. Melink has done work for companies such as Marriott, Whole Foods and Procter & Gamble, he said. "Let's do the right thing and set the right standards. Either follow the world – or lead it," Melink said. Lebanon native Tyler Duvelius, a board member of the Ohio Conservative Energy Forum and an executive member of Ohio Young Republicans, says what's happening right now just isn't working, and it means Ohio is missing out attracting 21st-century jobs and companies. Many big companies, including Facebook, General Motors, Adobe and Coca-Cola have committed to operate 100 percent of their business with renewable energy, some as soon as 2020. "The previous standards might be too high for some conservatives, but there's a serious discussion about how we find a true standard," said Duvelius, who is also the Ohio director for the Christian Coalition. "You don't have to open your Bible very far to where you hear God calling on us to take care of his creation," Duvelius said. To that, Seitz said, "It's not the government's job to legislate morality." Ohio Sen. Bill Seitz, a Republican from Cincinnati, has been one of the most active politicians in the clean energy regulations debate in recent years.  (Photo: Provided) Seitz's view on clean energy regulations 1. The senator's view on climate change. "My view on climate change is that the climate has changed for millions of years and continues to change. I think there may be a contribution from manmade sources." 2. Seitz: This is about cost. During a 45-minute interview on the topic, Seitz said, "this is not about renewable energy" and "this is not about coal. ... Since everyone is for clean energy and thinks it's free, we thought it would be a good idea to disclose on their bill just how much we are paying for this stuff ... By golly, here we are at the lower reaches of it (3 percent) and we're going to 12.5 percent on renewables, and we have bill increases of about 9 percent. We're not trying to protect the utilities here, we are trying to protect the ratepayer ... I recently read that wind and solar prices would decline by 59 percent by 2026. So my answer is: We'll buy it in 2026." Note: Seitz made clear that he meant an increase of 9 percent on the "generation" portion of people's utility bills, not the total cost.  2. Renewable energy companies are already getting a tax break.  "Federal taxpayers, which include you, me and everybody I guess but Donald Trump, are paying them a 30 percent subsidy now," Seitz said, referring to the renewable electricity production tax credit. "Why do you (companies) not only need this generous tax break and require the states to mandate that the utilities buy your overpriced stuff?" 3. Ohio isn't a good state for solar and wind. "Natural gas is what we have in Ohio. We are not a particularly good sun or wind state. There are places where that makes a great deal of sense – extremely windy and extremely sunny places." Note: Ohio's photovoltaic solar power potential runs in the middle of the pack, when compared with rest of the country, according to the Renewable Energy Technology Resource Maps and Technical Potential for the United States last updated in 2012. Ohio is on the lower half of the spectrum for wind potential and has better potential for biomass products like wood waste and landfill gas. Much of the state is "least unfavorable" for geothermal resources. 4. Senator asks why create state rules until we know what will happen with the federal Clean Power Plan?  "Under the Clean Power Plan, the federal government mandates to reduce carbon dioxide by 30 some percent by 2030. ... Why would we subject Ohio businesses and Ohio residents to escalating costs under the 2008 state mandate until we know how these mandates sync up?" Note: Ohio emits the fifth largest amount of carbon dioxide in the United States, though it is joined at the top of the list with other states that are the most populated. For context, the U.S. Supreme Court halted implementation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan after more than two dozen states requested a stay earlier this year. A legal case over whether the EPA has the authority to hold states to the standards is currently being heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals. However, despite Seitz's argument, 30 states have passed renewable portfolio standards that are not voluntary. What did Gov. John Kasich say in Texas? Ohio Gov. John Kasich recently sat down with CEO and co-founder of the nonprofit Texas Tribune Evan Smith for The Texas Tribute Festival in Austin, Texas. They spoke about a wide variety of issues facing America, energy and the environment were two of them. Evan Smith: You, I believe, have said climate change is ... Kasich: I think it’s real. I don’t want to overreact to it, but I think it’s real.  Smith: You know, the mere fact that you say those words, that’s a controversial thing. Kasich: Look, look. You know, when you get to be in public life, where you get responsibility, put your hands on the wheel and drive the car. What am I supposed to do? Take a poll? Who’s going to like this or that? Now look, when I say I believe there’s climate change, what do you do about it? I’m not for shutting down all this fossil fuel, I think this is extreme. Smith: You did advocate for a tax on hydraulic fracturing, did you not? Kasich: Yours (in Texas) is higher than ours, and I’d like to get ours higher so I can cut my income tax, instead of you taking all my liquids out of my state and living high on the hog here in Texas, you know. I like you, but I don’t like that idea. What I’m saying is, I think we need everything. Look, the Tesla is an amazing car. Are we going to get a breakthrough in battery technology? If we do, it will change everything in this country. I believe in solar and wind and all that, but let me tell you, I believe in fossil fuels, as well. With coal – clean it. Dig it, clean it and burn it. Nuclear power, you know ... I think there are a lot of people who are extreme, but this environment needs to be managed. I believe this Earth was given to us by the Lord, and we have an obligation to take care of it, but not worship it. Later, during a question and answer session: Man with question: According to a Mother Jones 2014 report, Ohio ranks 5th in carbon emissions producing some of the dirtiest energy in the country. As someone saying you stand by 98 percent of the international scientific community on climate change, do you find it hypocritical that you cited scrapping EPA regulations, the endorsement of fossil fuels and criticized last year’s climate deal in Paris? Kasich: My issue of Mother Jones didn’t come this month, so I haven’t checked those statistics. We reduced emissions in Ohio by 20 percent or the last seven, eight years, and we have also done a lot when it comes to methane in our fracking. We also have been very pro-environment, we put a billion dollars into cleaning up the lake (Erie). I said it earlier, if you have coal, you dig it, you clean it and then you burn it. We spend a lot of money on scrubbers in the state of Ohio, but emissions are down – and that’s a good thing. I am for developing all of these other resources and we have a program in Ohio that requires us to meet these certain standards. I’ve told the legislature, the standards that were set were unrealistic but if you try to kill the standards, whether it has to do with the renewables or whether it has to do with the issue of saving energy, I’ll veto the bill and we’ll go to the higher standards. I’m committed to it. 385 CONNECTTWEET 34 LINKEDIN 12 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2eA4hds TOP VIDEOS Sam DuBose sister: 'This, to me, is murder' 1:30 Protests in Cincinnati after Ray Tensing mistrial 1:09 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Mistrial declared in Ray Tensing case 3:46 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 Cincinnati Police Criminalist: Tensing 'seemed nervous or afraid' 2:59 Crime lab: No evidence on Tensing’s boots that he was dragged 4:07 Alternate juror in Ray Tensing trial has been dismissed 1:24 Lakota East's Horter wins state cross country 2:58 Born in Cincinnati, celebrated around the world: An anthem that unites us 3:39 Division I volleyball regional semifinals 1:46 More Stories Who the heck is Marilyn Z?

Share this article Share Oreo cookie-maker Mondelez International Inc tried to buy the company earlier this year after its shares were up 1.4 percent in pre-market trading.    Hersheys has appointed a special committee to search for a new CEO, led by Pamela Arway, chairwoman of the board's governance committee, aided by executive search firm Egon Zehnder. The company also maintained its full-year outlook as Bilbrey announced July 1 would be his last day in the job.   The move comes less than three months after the charitable trust that controls Hershey reached a major reform agreement with its overseer, the Pennsylvania attorney general's office, raising questions about its future plans for the company. The company, which is based in the town of Hershey, Pennsylvania, has a market capitalization of around $20billion. Bilbrey was named CEO of Hershey in 2011, after serving in various senior roles at the company since 2003.  He added the position of chairman in 2015.  Prior to Hershey, Bilbrey worked for 22 years at consumer company Procter and Gamble Co.  Following an initial spurned bid in June, Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld re-approached Bilbrey in August, indicating that Mondelez would be willing to offer $115 a share. Prior to Hershey, Bilbrey (center in light suit) worked for 22 years at consumer company Procter and Gamble Co Hershey responded to that offer by stating it would not be willing to enter into deal negotiations for an offer of less than $125 per share, a source said at the time.  The Hershey trust was set up by the company's founder over a century ago to fund and run a school for underprivileged children.  It holds 81 percent of the company's voting stock, and so a sale is not possible without its approval.  About two-thirds of its $12billion in assets are in Hershey stock.  Following a dispute with the Pennsylvania attorney general over its governance policy, the trust in July agreed to expand its board from 10 members to 13, and for five members to resign by year's end. With one trustee having resigned shortly before that agreement, that leaves a total of nine openings.  Even if the trust does decide to explore a sale of Hershey, the attorney general can thwart such plans.

But by the 1980s, social critics were sounding alarms that a groundswell of actual Satanic activity was responsible for subversive, soul-polluting behavior. A 1980 book, Michelle Remembers, purported to tell the story of Satanists who kidnapped and brainwashed a young woman, a spark that led to both the media and law enforcement driving home narratives that blamed ritualistic evil for crime and mass entertainment. Take a look at eight instances where self-appointed pop culture analysts insisted the devil was in the details.  1. SATAN'S VESSELS: THUNDERCATS AND THE SMURFS YouTube In 1986, author Phil Phillips published Turmoil in the Toybox, a book detailing how Masters of the Universe and other popular cartoons of the era were endorsing Pagan practices through coaxial cables. With pastor Gary Greenwald, Phillips also shot a video that elaborated on his theories. “The question is, is there a well organized plot, an insidious design right now, to program and influence the minds of our children toward the occult and witchcraft?” Greenwald asked. It was rhetorical, as the two explained that the ThunderCats were inspired by “heathen gods,” that E.T. “died and was resurrected again” and could therefore be confused with Christian figures, and that “there are things we need to look at concerning The Smurfs.” Because the characters are blue with black lips, they were “depictive of dead creatures.” Collectively, Saturday morning cartoons would teach children “to get into spells and witchcraft.” The two concluded their video essay by pointing out that Rainbow Brite had a Pentagram on her cheek. 2. THE JUDAS PRIEST TRIAL University of Lethbridge In December 1985, 18-year-old Raymond Belknap and 20-year-old James Vance ended a long night of drinking by committing to a suicide pact. Belknap shot and killed himself; Vance attempted to do the same but wound up surviving—with grievous and permanent disfiguring injury—the shotgun blast. Both men had been fans of the rock band Judas Priest, who had been reputed to have recorded subliminal messages in their music. Vance’s parents decided to sue the band and CBS Records for $6.2 million in damages, alleging phrases like “do it” and “let’s be dead” were being delivered to Vance’s subconscious. When the case went to a civil trial in 1990, audio engineers played the group's music backward and forward at varying speeds in an attempt to discern whether or not there were any hidden urgings for listeners to kill themselves. Ultimately, a judge ruled there were no messages in the music. Speaking to Rolling Stone in 2015, lead singer Rob Halford expressed both relief and disappointment in the tragic circumstances. “Had the judge found in favor about the so-called subliminal messages having the power to physically manifest themselves and make people to do something, the ramifications of that would've been extraordinary,” he said. “How do you prove to somebody that there are not subliminal messages on your record when you can't hear them in the first place?” 3. THE DUNGEON MASTER iStock Introduced in 1974, Dungeons and Dragons quickly captured the imaginations of gamers who relished the opportunity to take on different guises in fantasy settings—and almost immediately found themselves embroiled in controversies over the game’s sorcery and occult elements. That hysteria reached new levels with the 1979 disappearance of James Egbert, a 16-year-old computer science student who was believed to have gotten lost in the underground steam tunnels near Michigan State University. The media quickly jumped on the theory that Egbert had become too absorbed in his role-playing and suffered a mental breakdown. The truth was less sinister, though just as tragic: Egbert had been suffering from the demands of being a child prodigy as well as shame over his homosexuality, prompting him to run away from school. He committed suicide in 1980. A fictionalized account of the case, Mazes and Monsters, was made for television in 1982 and starred Tom Hanks. All the negative publicity—one mother formed a group labeled "BADD "for "Bothered About Dungeons and Dragons," while creator Gary Gygax hired a bodyguard after receiving death threats—was free advertising for the game’s publisher, TSR. D&D sold $16 million in rule books in 1982 alone. 4. PAMPERS DIAPERS iStock In 1985, Procter & Gamble found itself in the unusual position of having to hold a press conference to deny that they were funding a Satanic church. Since 1982, the company had been the target of anonymous accusations claiming their logo—a man in the moon surrounded by 13 stars—was secretly the mark of the devil. So many calls poured into the distributor of Ivory soap, Pampers diapers, and other household toiletries that they were forced to set up a toll-free number to refute allegations that they were beholden to the Church of Satan. (As for the stars: When the company was formed in 1882, they were intended to represent the original 13 colonies.) The rumors ultimately prompted Procter & Gamble to remove the symbol from its packaging. 5. THE MCMARTIN PRESCHOOL SCANDAL In one of the most sensationalized criminal trials of the 20th century, employees of the McMartin Preschool near Los Angeles stood accused of improper behavior and molestation of their students. After one 3-year-old’s mother grew convinced her son had been subject to abuse, several more children came forward. Some of the accounts included details of ritualistic animal slaughter, leading investigators to believe the school had become the epicenter of an occult organization. After a six-year trial—the longest in American history—no one was convicted; a post-mortem of the investigation revealed several children had been subject to coercive interviews with law enforcement.    6. THE MR. ED MESSAGE FROM HELL It wasn’t solely popular culture of the 1980s that was being examined for traces of occult worship. In 1986, two evangelists from Ohio—Jim Brown and Greg Hudson—claimed that they had excavated a hidden message in the unlikeliest of sources: the theme song from Mr. Ed. The 1960s sitcom about a talking horse opened with the title song “A Horse is a Horse.” Played backward, the preachers insisted, one could hear sinister undertones like “The Source is Satan” and “Someone heard this song for Satan.” The discovery was mentioned during a seminar for teenagers on the moral evaporation caused by rock music. The teens then burned 300 popular albums in a pyre. Despite the discovery, Brown said he didn’t think the producers of Mr. Ed were actual Satanists. “We don’t think they did it on purpose,” he said. 7. CHILD SACRIFICE ON HALLOWEEN iStock In 1989, parents in North Carolina were reluctant to send their children out for Halloween candy on the heels of rumors that Satanists planned to abduct and murder them in ritual sacrifice. More than 500 calls flooded area police stations in Raleigh after word spread that blonde boys from the ages of 2 to 5 were the devil worshippers’ preferred targets; mothers indicated they were considering dyeing their sons' hair to avoid a catastrophe. Police never found evidence of the plot. 8. THE GERALDO INCIDENT Geraldo's tips for profiling a Satanist. Kiran Kava via YouTube At the height of Satanic hysteria in 1988, broadcast journalist Geraldo Rivera compiled a two-hour special for NBC that purported to detail the lurid mission of devil worshippers. Devil Worship: Exposing Satan’s Underground posited that a secret cabal of Satanists numbering in excess of one million were responsible for messages in heavy metal and inspiring the behavior of cult leaders like Charles Manson. “The majority of them are linked in a highly organized, very secretive network,” Rivera intoned. “From small towns to large cities, they have attracted police and FBI attention to their satanic ritual child abuse, child pornography, and grisly Satanic murders. The odds are that this is happening in your town." The special aired in primetime to stellar ratings, grabbing the attention of nearly 20 million homes, although advertisers were reluctant to buy commercial spots. While Rivera presented a compelling case for concern, the mass media took care to note that the special didn’t come from NBC’s news programmers: it was a product of the network’s entertainment division.

You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You’re all set! Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Allan Sloan October 14 That ground-breaking program in Colorado? Warren Buffett's family paid for that. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) When Warren Buffett disclosed information from his own personal tax returns and stomped Donald Trump so skillfully a few days ago, the stories just wrote themselves. Buffett, who has called early and often for tax increases on America’s biggest earners, punched out the tax-dodging Trump for saying during Sunday’s presidential debate that Buffett “took a massive tax deduction” and that he was dodging taxes the same way Trump was. Buffett emerged triumphant. However, if Trump had done some homework, he could have said that Buffett, like Trump himself, has pursued aggressive, money-saving tax strategies. Which, in fact, Buffett has. But Buffett has pursued these strategies not for himself, but for the company he runs: Berkshire Hathaway. In transactions in 2014 and last year, Berkshire did three “cash-rich split-off” transactions that allowed it to end up with lots of cash and assets while avoiding what I estimate to be a total of about $2.5 billion in capital gains taxes. Berkshire did what amounted to complicated trades with three companies whose shares it had owned for years, swapping those holdings for a combination of cash and operating assets. The transactions are treated by the IRS as tax-free trades, rather than sales. For example, Berkshire got $450 million in cash and a business valued at $900 million from Phillips 66 in return for its Phillips 66 shares, which were valued at $660 million in 2012 when ConocoPhillips (a stock Berkshire had bought in 2008) spun off Phillips 66 to Berkshire and its other shareholders. Berkshire did similar stock-for-cash-and-assets swaps with Graham Holdings (former owner of The Washington Post) and Procter & Gamble. By my count, the three transactions that yielded cash and assets were worth $6.2 billion more than Berkshire’s $1 billion total cost for its stock in the companies, which in the case of Graham Holdings dated back more than 40 years. At a combined state and federal tax rate of about 40 percent—there is no special capital gains rate for corporations—selling its holdings in those three companies for cash would have triggered a $2.5 billion tax bill. But because Berkshire (whose shareholders include me) swapped shares for cash and other assets in split-off transactions, it realized major gains but didn’t have to pay gains tax. I’ve previously written about these three transactions, as well as a fourth one that Berkshire did in 2008. I emailed Buffett’s assistant Thursday seeking comment but did not receive a response. I had tried to speak with Buffett about these deals last year, but he said wouldn’t talk with me because he didn’t like the way I had written about a different tax-aggressive transaction that Berkshire was involved in. To wit, that was the 2014 deal in which Berkshire helped Burger King desert to Canada for tax purposes by buying the Canadian-based Tim Horton restaurant chain. A trademark of Buffett’s tax-minimizing deals for Berkshire is buying new issues of preferred stock rather than common stock. That's what happened when General Electric, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs turned up on Buffett’s doorstep seeking both capital and Buffett’s imprimatur during and after the financial crisis. Dividends, you see, are partly tax-free for corporate recipients, even though they’re generally fully taxable for individuals. I’m not trying to imply that Berkshire’s transactions are either illegal or unethical. They’re not. The point I’m trying to make is that there’s a huge difference between the way Buffett the person handles his personal income taxes and the way Buffett the CEO handles Berkshire’s corporate income taxes. Buffett the person’s tax practices qualify him for sainthood, because among other things, his generous donations of Berkshire stock to charitable causes generate billions of dollars more in tax deductions than he will ever use. Buffett the CEO’s tax practices qualify him … to be a CEO, trying to maximize profits for his shareholders. His behavior is much better than Trump’s, because Berkshire is highly profitable and pays substantial income taxes. But Buffett the CEO is no saint — and it’s a mistake to think of him as one. business wonkblog true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

The move comes less than three months after the charitable trust that controls Hershey reached a major reform agreement with its overseer, the Pennsylvania attorney general's office, raising questions about the trust's plans for the company. The selection of the new CEO could determine not just the company's financial performance, but also whether the trust will continue to rely on Hershey as its main asset. About two-thirds of the trust's $12 billion in assets are in Hershey stock. During Bilbrey's five-year tenure as CEO, Hershey doubled its market value to $20 billion, improved its profit margins, and increased its market share in the United States to 31.3 percent from 28.3 percent. Hershey also began to diversify beyond its core confectionary business into other types of snacks. The Kisses chocolate maker said on Friday it appointed a special committee to search for a new CEO. The committee will be led by Pamela Arway, chairwoman of the board's governance committee, helped by executive search firm Egon Zehnder. The committee is considering internal and external candidates for the CEO job, and Hershey Chief Operating Officer Michele Buck is one of the contenders, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing confidential deliberations. FAMILY TIME Bilbrey will continue as non-executive chairman of the board following his retirement as president and CEO, Hershey said. The company also maintained its full-year earnings outlook. Reuters reported exclusively on Thursday that Bilbrey was preparing to step down by next summer. "All of the decisions in my career have been made in consultation with my wife, Teresa, with the impact to our children and our family being paramount. And so it is with that in mind that I have shared with our board, and now you, my decision to retire next year in order to spend more time with my family and wonderful grandchildren who have faithfully and selflessly supported me for so long," Bilbrey wrote in a note to Hershey employees on Friday. Bilbrey was named CEO of Hershey in 2011 after serving in various senior roles at the company since 2003. He added the position of chairman in 2015. Prior to Hershey, Bilbrey worked for 22 years at consumer company Procter & Gamble Co. Following an initial spurned bid in June, Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld re-approached Bilbrey in August, indicating that Mondelez would be willing to offer $115 a share, or about $24.5 billion overall, Reuters reported at the time. Hershey responded that it would not be willing to enter into deal negotiations for an offer of less than $125 per share, a source said at the time. The Hershey trust was set up by the company's founder over a century ago to fund and run a school for underprivileged children. It holds 81 percent of the company's voting stock, and so a sale is not possible without its approval. Following a dispute with the Pennsylvania attorney general over its governance policy, the trust in July agreed to expand its board to 13 members from 10, and for five members to resign by the end of the year. With one trustee having resigned shortly before that agreement, that leaves a total of nine openings. "Everybody wants clarity. The more ambiguity there is about a situation, the more difficult it is to recruit into it," said Peter Crist, chairman of recruiting firm Crist Kolder Associates, referring to the impact the turnover at the Hershey trust will have on the Hershey CEO search. Even if the trust does decide to explore a sale of Hershey, the attorney general can thwart such plans. On Friday, one of the people who agreed to resign from the trust's board by the end of the year, James Nevels, said he would not stand for re-election on Hershey's board in 2017. Nevels currently serves as Hershey's lead independent board director.

Steel Strips Wheels' (SSWL) total increase is from original order of 7,000 wheels to about 34,000 wheels in the shipment period of October 2016 to March 2017.

The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits held at a 43-year low last week, pointing to sustained labor market strength that could pave the way for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December.

The move comes less than three months after the charitable trust that controls Hershey reached a major reform agreement with its overseer, the Pennsylvania attorney general's office, raising questions about the trust's plans for the company. The selection of the new CEO could determine not just the company's financial performance, but also whether the trust will continue to rely on Hershey as its main asset. About two-thirds of the trust's $12 billion in assets are in Hershey stock. During Bilbrey's five-year tenure as CEO, Hershey doubled its market value to $20 billion, improved its profit margins, and increased its market share in the United States to 31.3 percent from 28.3 percent. Hershey also began to diversify beyond its core confectionary business into other types of snacks. The Kisses chocolate maker said on Friday it appointed a special committee to search for a new CEO. The committee will be led by Pamela Arway, chairwoman of the board's governance committee, helped by executive search firm Egon Zehnder. The committee is considering internal and external candidates for the CEO job, and Hershey Chief Operating Officer Michele Buck is one of the contenders, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing confidential deliberations. FAMILY TIME Bilbrey will continue as non-executive chairman of the board following his retirement as president and CEO, Hershey said. The company also maintained its full-year earnings outlook. Reuters reported exclusively on Thursday that Bilbrey was preparing to step down by next summer. "All of the decisions in my career have been made in consultation with my wife, Teresa, with the impact to our children and our family being paramount. And so it is with that in mind that I have shared with our board, and now you, my decision to retire next year in order to spend more time with my family and wonderful grandchildren who have faithfully and selflessly supported me for so long," Bilbrey wrote in a note to Hershey employees on Friday. Bilbrey was named CEO of Hershey in 2011 after serving in various senior roles at the company since 2003. He added the position of chairman in 2015. Prior to Hershey, Bilbrey worked for 22 years at consumer company Procter & Gamble Co. Following an initial spurned bid in June, Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld re-approached Bilbrey in August, indicating that Mondelez would be willing to offer $115 a share, or about $24.5 billion overall, Reuters reported at the time. Hershey responded that it would not be willing to enter into deal negotiations for an offer of less than $125 per share, a source said at the time. The Hershey trust was set up by the company's founder over a century ago to fund and run a school for underprivileged children. It holds 81 percent of the company's voting stock, and so a sale is not possible without its approval. Following a dispute with the Pennsylvania attorney general over its governance policy, the trust in July agreed to expand its board to 13 members from 10, and for five members to resign by the end of the year. With one trustee having resigned shortly before that agreement, that leaves a total of nine openings. "Everybody wants clarity. The more ambiguity there is about a situation, the more difficult it is to recruit into it," said Peter Crist, chairman of recruiting firm Crist Kolder Associates, referring to the impact the turnover at the Hershey trust will have on the Hershey CEO search. Even if the trust does decide to explore a sale of Hershey, the attorney general can thwart such plans. On Friday, one of the people who agreed to resign from the trust's board by the end of the year, James Nevels, said he would not stand for re-election on Hershey's board in 2017. Nevels currently serves as Hershey's lead independent board director.

Ogg October 15, 2016 11:35 am EST Print Email Tweet The week of October 14 was a volatile one, considering how there has been a lack of volatility most of the summer. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) ended the week down roughly 102 points at 18,138.38. Still, investors have become prone to buying their favorite stocks any time the market sells off. High valuations, and even the notion that this bull market is now seven and a half years old, have not thwarted investor appetites. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each morning, and this ends up being hundreds of analyst calls each week. Our goal is to find new investing and trading ideas for our readers. Some of these reports cover stocks to buy that are blue chip stocks. When investors hear the word “blue chip” it generally means DJIA stocks with solid dividends. Sometimes this also refers to former Dow stocks, or stocks that might become Dow stocks. Here, we stick by the traditional Dow stocks. Here were six solid Buy ratings (which includes equivalent Outperform or Overweight ratings) issued in the blue chips during the week of October 14. Just remember: sometimes analysts are wrong, and even the great blue chip stocks come with no guarantees. Apple Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been on a serious recovery. The iPhone maker is winning from Samsung’s smartphone recall and cancellation, and Apple finished up 3.1% this week at $117.66, for a 13% gain so far in 2016. It turns out that multiple analysts raised their targets, either on share price targets or on their estimates for sales and earnings. 24/7 Wall St. tracked several major analyst calls this last week, with Credit Suisse even calling for $150 per share next year, and it even shows a trend of more upgraded estimates the prior week as well. Apple has a 52-week trading range of $89.47 to $123.82, and it has a Thomson Reuters consensus analyst price target of $127.59. Most investors do not buy Apple for its yield, but the company is buying back stock rapidly, and it still comes with almost a 2% dividend yield to boot. Caterpillar It would appear that Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) is in a stealth turnaround. The company’s numbers are still bad, and the trends look in decline from prior growth years. Still, sometimes the investing community treats value and serious stock sell-offs differently. Amazingly, Caterpillar is the top performing Dow stock of 2016, with a gain of 33% so far this year, and it still pays a 3.5% dividend yield. Caterpillar was raised to Buy from Neutral with a $112 price target at Goldman Sachs on October 11. The prior close was $88.22, and Caterpillar ended the week at $87.67. Its 52-week range is $56.36 to $89.87, and its consensus analyst target is $77.37. Investors need to consider that this is the highest analyst target of all now, and Goldman Sachs expects margin expansion and an earnings recovery much greater than investors have expected. Merck While Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) remains close to a 52-week high, investors should not overlook the fact that it is up 20.5% so far in 2016. Merrill Lynch raised its rating on the stock to Buy from Neutral on October 13. Its price objective was raised to $70 from $57 as well, and that is above the $67.79 consensus target. Note that the Merrill Lynch call is based on compelling data for its Keytruda first line lung cancer drug. The firm sees it becoming the standard of care and having 25% share. Merck has a 52-week trading range of $47.97 to $64.86, and its dividend yield is right a 3%. Nike Nike Inc. (NYSE: NKE) has been down and out in 2016, logging the worst performance this year of all 30 Dow stocks with close to a 17% negative return. That isn’t the growth engine we were used to. After the latest earnings report offered disappointing futures sales, Susquehanna decided that enough is enough. The firm raised Nike’s rating to Positive from Neutral on October 11, and it assigned a $63 price target too. The prior closing price was $51.79. The consensus price target now is $63.71, though Thomson Reuters showed a consensus of closer to $67 just 90 days ago. Nike close out the week at $51.62 a share, and its 52-week range is $51.48 to $68.19. The dividend yield is currently only 1.25%, but the company has much more room to grow that payout in the years ahead. Procter & Gamble It may still be a boring blue chip in consumer products, but Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) just keeps chugging along. Now it has a brand sale under its belt in the long road of restructuring into a slimmer and more core-focused company. Independent research firm Argus came out swinging here, saying that the street is grossly undervaluing the growth prospects and underestimating its value. Argus raised the stock to a Buy from Hold on October 12, and it assigned a $103 price target as well. This target compared with a prior close of $88.54, as well as a 52-week trading range of $73.50 to $90.33. The consensus price target at Thomson Reuters is $92.28. Procter & Gamble still comes with an impressive 4% dividend yield, and it has been among the few 50-year dividend gainers and likely will keep raising that payout ahead.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Oct 15, 2016 at 10:29AM Stocks fell slightly last week as quarterly earnings results began to trickle in. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) each lost less than 1% to hold at 4% gains so far in 2016. ^DJI data by YCharts. Third-quarter earnings season hits high gear over the next few trading days, with dozens of the market's biggest companies set to announce their results. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stocks could see significant swings following the companies' reports. Netflix's growth slowdown Netflix posts its quarterly report after the market closes on Monday, and investors might want to buckle up for some intense volatility. After all, the streaming video giant fell 13% on the day following its last quarterly report, which showed a surprising subscriber growth slowdown. Narcos. Image Source: Netflix. CEO Reed Hastings and his executive team aren't projecting much of a rebound this time around. Netflix is expecting to add just 2.3 million new users in the quarter compared to 3.6 million in the year-ago period. Challenges detracting from growth should include more defections tied to its price hike in addition to the negative impact of global attention turning to the Olympic games. On the plus side, the company aims to post improving profitability, as a larger percentage of its U.S. member base rolls on to its pricier plans, and as international markets begin to mature toward positive contributions. Hastings will also have plenty to say about the company's ambitious content strategy that this quarter included the launch of its multi-year exclusive content deal with Disney. Bank of America's low expectations Bank of America will announce its earnings results before the market opens on Monday. Despite solid gains over the last three months, the banking giant's stock is underperforming the broader market this year, and remains mired at a lower valuation than its peers.  That trend might not quickly change, especially as it appears that the current low-interest-rate environment will persist for years to come. That big-picture headwind can be seen pinching its results this quarter, even after last quarter's strong results. Consensus estimates call for earnings to fall to $0.33 per share from $0.37 per share in Q3, and for sales to stay flat against the prior-year period, at $20.9 billion.  The company can't do much about the cyclical pressure on its industry, but a focus on building up its loan and deposit balances while cutting costs should put it in position to reap big rewards when interest rates finally move higher. In the meantime, surprisingly strong results from its peers suggest that shareholders might be in for some good news this week. Johnson & Johnson's product pipeline Healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson is due to post earnings numbers on Tuesday morning. Judging by the stock's moves lately, investors are expecting to hear plenty of good news. Accelerating sales and profit growth over the last few quarters have helped JNJ rise 17% so far this year, making it the fourth-best performer on the Dow. Image source: Getty Images. Last quarter, for example, revenue rose 5%, after accounting for negative currency swings, compared to a 2% boost for Procter & Gamble. And unlike its consumer-goods-focused peer, Johnson & Johnson saw market-share gains across its portfolio. CEO Alex Gorsky said at the time that executives are seeing "strong underlying growth across our enterprise." Investors are looking for more of the same this quarter: Consensus estimates call for earnings to jump 11%, to $1.65 per share, as revenue rises 4%. Investors can look for the pharmaceutical giant to again be the standout performer, as Johnson & Johnson's huge commitment to research and development continues to produce a strong new-product pipeline. One-quarter of the healthcare giant's sales come from products launched over just the last five years, and keeping up that pace requires a constant stream of groundbreaking introductions.

When pseudo-logic is everywhere, emotional marketing is what breaks through Bruce Philp || October 14, 2016 Topics Marketing, Advertising Print Email Comment Share: A “Leave” supporter celebrates as British referendum results roll in on June 23, 2016. Photo: Ray Tang/Rex/AP Baseless provocation has become big business in politics lately—take Brexit and the improbable candidacy of Donald Trump for two particularly vivid examples—and, if they have any sense, marketers are taking notes. The Donald has proven to have a particularly sick genius for whipping up a crowd, with his trademark mix of belligerent non sequitur and naked pandering. Its appeal doesn’t seem broad enough to get him elected, but it’s certainly enough to make people pay attention, and that’s a hot commodity these days. Pundits now anguish over our “post-factual democracy,” in which people’s politics aren’t rooted in principle anymore. If voters aren’t being even slightly cerebral about the destinies of nations, will they be any more so when it comes to toothpaste and canned soup? MORE CONSEQUENCES: What Brexit Could Mean for Canadian Small Businesses » That may seem like a leap, but brands have fed on the zeitgeist since forever. Ad people like to believe that they create the public’s tastes and moods (when they’re not “disrupting” them), but it’s usually more a matter of paddling around on their intellectual surfboards, searching for a cultural wave they can profitably ride to the beach. These days, though, maybe for the first time ever, they’re plying the wrong ocean. While keynote speakers bluster about awesome products, and smug digerati busily codify consumer behavior, those very consumers are developing an antagonistic distrust of objectivity, or what passes for it. We’re competing in emotional times, now, and reason has become obsolete. Though the debate over emotional versus rational advertising is as old as the martini, rationality’s days have been numbered for some time. Its origins are found in the industrial age, when the whole of corporate might was thrown at finding new consumer problems to solve. But socks can only get so white, and cabs only so easy to hail. It’s inevitable that consumers would turn their attention to more profound themes when it came to choosing brands. Marketers should have been ready for that, but nobody was ready for today’s seething frustration. This isn’t evolution, it’s insurrection. Finding it increasingly difficult to distinguish between nuance and prevarication, people are raging against even having to try. MORE EMOTIONS: A New Way to Know What Your Customers Are Thinking »  Nobler minds can ponder what this means for democracy—but marketers should still be paying attention. If there’s no distinction between claims and lies anymore, then the only truth people will trust is the one they feel. And they’ll soon bring that bias to the mall, not just the voting booth. Consider: 20 years ago, the ad campaign judged most effective in America was about the perils of switching dog food. This year, it was moms advocating for gun control. Canada’s effectiveness champ two decades ago was a new flavour of mouthwash; this year, that same gun control–campaign shared top honours with P&G, which turned buying feminine hygiene products into an act of political defiance. When pseudo-logic is everywhere, feelings are what break through. Turning a brand into a social cause is risky business. Most corporations are already short on moral authority, even before you add in the profit motive. But this is a good moment to look up from our spreadsheets and remember that consumers are human. It’s easy to criticize people for abandoning reason and making choices from the heart, especially if those choices seem bonkers. They’re not fools, though; they’ve simply fallen back on ancient instinct to cope with an over-marketed, amoral world. Which means that, if we’re not careful, claims-based advertising (30% more peanuts in every bite!) can inadvertently make things worse instead of winning people over. Ads are supposed to provoke. Even if your snack food is never going to save the world, it’s no longer an option to ignore how consumers feel about where it fits in their lives, or how they want it to. It’s no longer an option to be indifferent to their vanities, their insecurities, or their aspirations, because those things may be the last, best way to earn their attention. To coin a phrase, if we want to make advertising great again, we need to get more empathetic, not more clever.

"Cyberbullying has become prevalent in schools today, but it doesn't stop there — it is affecting our children 24/7, and as a mother of two daughters, I am acutely aware of the magnitude of this issue," said Kathryn Kane, senior director-global brand and campaigns, Norton by Symantec. At the heart of the campaign is the film, "Raise Your Voice Against Cyberbullying." Sparked by a creative concept developed by Grey San Francisco and brought to life with Chelsea House and filmmaker, Peyton Wilson, "Raise Your Voice Against Cyberbullying" aims to inspire parents to help their children address cyberbullying and overcome its effects. The film features raw accounts of real cyberbullying attacks told from the victims' point of view, and breaks the silence of cyberbullying as the victims' parents hear of the attacks for the first time. At the film's conclusion, the audience is asked to continue the conversation on social media through #RaiseOurVoices wherever cyberbullying is encountered. See film: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAGcPvygSOw October is National Bullying Prevention Month, but cyberbullying impacts families throughout the year. In fact, the 2015 Norton Cybersecurity Insights Report revealed that 27 percent of US parents felt their children were more likely to be bullied online than in the classroom. "Norton by Symantec is the world's leading consumer cyber security brand, and we want to use our leadership position to not only shed light on these very real and culturally-relevant topics, but also present people with solutions and a way to affect change. Inspiring parents to raise their voices is a simple solution that can have a massive impact," Kane added. To help parents learn more about cyberbullying, Norton created an e-book. The e-book offers an authentic look at cyberbullying, and features illustrations created by children aged 11 to 18 who have personally experienced cyberbullying. Also featured are tips to help parents recognize the signs of cyberbullying and a conversation guide to help parents start a related conversation with their children.  See e-book: http://now.symassets.com/content/dam/content/en-us/collaterals/ebook/norton-cyberbullying-guide.pdf Anti-bullying organizations such as PACER and Common Sense Media are working with Norton to activate #RaiseOurVoices wherever kids go online. Norton is also actively engaging with victims and parents on social platforms to encourage them to raise their voices via video, pictures or text.. "Norton security solutions have protected people and their devices for decades," said Milan Martin, Grey San Francisco President. "The old saying, 'sticks and stones can break my bones but names can never hurt me,' tragically, just isn't true today. We couldn't be more proud to help Norton address very real, very important issues in our world today."

Bilbrey, smiles as he stands on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York October 31, 2014. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo By Greg Roumeliotis and Lauren Hirsch Hershey Co, the chocolate maker that Oreo cookie-maker Mondelez International Inc tried to buy earlier this year, said on Friday that Chief Executive John Bilbrey would retire from his post on July 1. The company's shares were up 1.4 percent in premarket trading. Bilbrey will continue as non-executive chairman of the board following his retirement as president and CEO, Hershey said. The Kisses chocolate maker said it appointed a special committee to search for a new CEO. The committee will be led by Pamela Arway, chairwoman of the board's governance committee, aided by executive search firm Egon Zehnder. The company also maintained its full-year outlook. Reuters reported exclusively on Thursday that Bilbrey was preparing to step down by next summer. "Now is the right time to begin the process of handing over the reins as CEO as it will allow me to spend more time with my family and wonderful grandchildren," Bilbrey said in a statement. The move comes less than three months after the charitable trust that controls Hershey reached a major reform agreement with its overseer, the Pennsylvania attorney general's office, raising questions about its future plans for the company. The company, which is based in the town of Hershey, Pennsylvania, has a market capitalization of around $20 billion. Bilbrey was named CEO of Hershey in 2011, after serving in various senior roles at the company since 2003. He added the position of chairman in 2015. Prior to Hershey, Bilbrey worked for 22 years at consumer company Procter & Gamble Co. Following an initial spurned bid in June, Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld re-approached Bilbrey in August, indicating that Mondelez would be willing to offer $115 a share, Reuters reported at the time. Hershey responded to that offer by stating it would not be willing to enter into deal negotiations for an offer of less than $125 per share, a source said at the time. The Hershey trust was set up by the company's founder over a century ago to fund and run a school for underprivileged children. It holds 81 percent of the company's voting stock, and so a sale is not possible without its approval. About two-thirds of its $12 billion in assets are in Hershey stock. Following a dispute with the Pennsylvania attorney general over its governance policy, the trust in July agreed to expand its board from 10 members to 13, and for five members to resign by year's end. With one trustee having resigned shortly before that agreement, that leaves a total of nine openings. Even if the trust does decide to explore a sale of Hershey, the attorney general can thwart such plans.

In the role, Reid will lead creative across Deep Focus’s client roster, which includes Nestlé, Frito-Lay, eBay, Intel and Purina, while reporting directly to CEO Ian Schafer. “John’s unique mix of traditional and digital brand-building experience makes him well-positioned to further establish Deep Focus as a world-class integrated creative agency,” Schafer said in a statement, adding that he sees Reid’s hire as a turning point and that Deep Focus has begun to compete more directly with “traditional” agencies for new business — especially over the past year. Schafer said: “There are instances where we’ve been brought on as a social agency and ended up as lead creative agency. It seems like everything is up for grabs to everyone in many cases as long as you meet the minimum requirements. … The RFPs we’ve been getting over the past year have been vaguer than ever before, and I see that as an opportunity.” Reid fills a role left vacant since Engine Group spun off Deep Focus’ content creation studio, Moment Studio, as a separate Engine Group unit with Ken Kraemer serving as CEO. “It’s been quite a long journey in hiring someone [to replace Kraemer],” Schafer told Adweek. “We’re happy to have found the right person.” Reid has served as executive vice president, chief creative officer for Wunderman since July of 2010, working with clients including P&G, Audi, Campbell’s V8, E*Trade, the Ad Council, AARP, BMO Harris Bank, Johnson and Johnson and Land Rover. Before joining Wunderman he served short stints as a creative director with ATTIK, working with Toyota, TiVo, Lucas Arts, OnLive, Ubisoft and HBO, and a freelance creative director with CP+B before that, working with Microsoft, American Express, Best Buy, Burger King and Coke Zero. Prior to that he spent over six and half years as a vice president, associate creative director with McCann Erickson, where he worked with Microsoft, HP, the Oakland A’s, Nortel, and AMD. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Prior to Hershey, Bilbrey worked for 22 years at consumer company Procter & Gamble Co. Following an initial spurned bid in June, Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld re-approached Bilbrey in August, indicating that Mondelez would be willing to offer $115 a share, Reuters reported at the time. Hershey responded to that offer by stating it would not be willing to enter into deal negotiations for an offer of less than $125 per share, a source said at the time. The Hershey trust was set up by the company's founder over a century ago to fund and run a school for underprivileged children. It holds 81 percent of the company's voting stock, and so a sale is not possible without its approval. About two-thirds of its $12 billion in assets are in Hershey stock. Following a dispute with the Pennsylvania attorney general over its governance policy, the trust in July agreed to expand its board from 10 members to 13, and for five members to resign by year's end. With one trustee having resigned shortly before that agreement, that leaves a total of nine openings. Even if the trust does decide to explore a sale of Hershey, the attorney general can thwart such plans.  Go to MSN Home More in Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times 7 things you should never do online USA TODAY The world's most valuable stamps Lovemoney 6 Social Security changes coming in 2017 U.S. News & World Report - Money Up Next 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More From Reuters Thailand's 'floating basket' festival muted as country mourns king Reuters Korean rookie Park set to link up with Creamer caddie Cann Reuters Samsung Electronics agrees to buy Harman for $8 billion Reuters Reuters View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

Greg Roumeliotis and Lauren Hirsch Reuters Published Friday, Oct. 14, 2016 7:46AM EDT Last updated Friday, Oct. 14, 2016 7:48AM EDT Comments AA Hershey Co, the chocolate maker that Oreo cookie-maker Mondelez International Inc tried to buy earlier this year, said on Friday that Chief Executive John Bilbrey would retire from his post on July 1. Bilbrey will continue as non-executive chairman of the board following his retirement as president and CEO, Hershey said. The company said it had created a special committee to search for a new chief executive. Reuters reported exclusively on Thursday that Bilbrey was preparing to step down by next summer. The move comes less than three months after the charitable trust that controls Hershey reached a major reform agreement with its overseer, the Pennsylvania attorney general’s office, raising questions about its future plans for the company. Bilbrey is stepping down to spend more time with his family, a person familiar with the matter had told Reuters. The company, which is based in the town of Hershey, Pennsylvania, has a market capitalization of around $20-billion. Bilbrey was named CEO of Hershey in 2011, after serving in various senior roles at the company since 2003. He added the position of chairman in 2015. Prior to Hershey, Bilbrey worked for 22 years at consumer company Procter & Gamble Co. Following an initial spurned bid in June, Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld re-approached Bilbrey in August, indicating that Mondelez would be willing to offer $115 a share, Reuters reported at the time. Hershey responded to that offer by stating it would not be willing to enter into deal negotiations for an offer of less than $125 per share, a source said at the time. The Hershey trust was set up by the company’s founder over a century ago to fund and run a school for underprivileged children. It holds 81 per cent of the company’s voting stock, and so a sale is not possible without its approval. About two-thirds of its $12-billion in assets are in Hershey stock. Following a dispute with the Pennsylvania attorney general over its governance policy, the trust in July agreed to expand its board from 10 members to 13, and for five members to resign by year’s end. With one trustee having resigned shortly before that agreement, that leaves a total of nine openings. Even if the trust does decide to explore a sale of Hershey, the attorney general can thwart such plans. The trust put Hershey up for sale in 2002, and the attorney general’s office successfully petitioned a court to block the offer amid local community protests. Pennsylvania attorney general Kathleen Kane stepped down this summer following a criminal conviction. She was succeeded by her deputy, Bruce Castor, and the post is up for election in November.

The move comes less than three months after the charitable trust that controls Hershey reached a major reform agreement with its overseer, the Pennsylvania attorney general's office, raising questions about its future plans for the company. Hershey's board of directors is already preparing for the resignation of CEO John Bilbrey, and has formed a committee to find a successor, the people said. Bilbrey is stepping down to spend more time with his family, one of the people said. He plans to remain non-executive chairman on Hershey's board, that person added. Bilbrey was named CEO of Hershey in 2011, after serving in various senior roles at the company since 2003. He added the position of Chairman in 2015. Prior to Hershey, Bilbrey worked for 22 years at consumer company Procter & Gamble Co. Following its initial spurned bid in June, Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld reapproached Bilbrey in August, indicating that Mondelez would be willing to offer $115 a share, Reuters reported at the time.

The Hershey trust was set up by the company's founder over a century ago to fund and run a school for underprivileged children. It holds 81 percent of the company's voting stock, and so a sale is not possible without its approval. About two-thirds of its $12 billion in assets are in Hershey stock.

Even if the trust does decide to explore a sale of Hershey, the attorney general can thwart such plans. The trust put Hershey up for sale in 2002, and the attorney general's office successfully petitioned a court to block the offer amid local community protests. Pennsylvania's attorney general seat remains in flux, with the attorney general Kathleen Kane having stepped down this summer following a criminal conviction. She was succeeded by her deputy, Bruce Castor, and the post is up for election in November.

The campaign, executed on behalf of Revlon, will benefit from indaHash's unique ability to automate collaboration between brands and digital influencers. Setting momentum for great digital moments The campaign marks the beginning of an exclusive, strategic South African partnership between MediaCom’s content division, MediaCom Beyond Advertising (MBA) and indaHash. Because indaHash will be exclusively distributed through MediaCom in South Africa, all agencies and advertisers have the opportunity to utilise this unique technology through the MBA division. Joanna Pawluk The first South African campaign involved the marketing of Revlon’s Great Moments competition. The influencers were asked, through the indaHash app, to select one of the prize holidays, take a photo of the indispensable items they would take along for an expedition and add Revlon deodorant to the picture. Additionally, influencers will tell their followers about the competition and encourage them to participate. The competition runs until 31 October 2016. Large influencer stable With an international platform that is fully automated, indaHash revolutionises the process of collaboration between brands and digital influencers. It was established at the beginning of 2016 and has since gathered over 65,000 influencers, steadily captured new markets and executed more than 200 campaigns for some of the world’s biggest brands, such as Coca-Cola, P&G, McDonald’s, and L’Oréal. Federico Dedeu For indaHash, Joanna Pawluk will be responsible for the development and launch of the platform in the South African market, while Mediacom Beyond Advertising will be represented by Federico Dedeu. Advertisement Dedeu, head of MBA, says, “The company is excited to be partnering with indaHash, as it is going to revolutionise the way brands are able to work with influencers. We have been consistently seeing the true value of this marketing method. The technology enables brands to easily work with one or 100 influencers at a time, as it manages the contracts and the different payment models. This means that budgets can work harder than ever before. Over and above this, brands retain the rights to the assets created by the influencers, which have production cost savings.” Pawluk, managing partner at indaHash, adds that in the case of South Africa, indaHash decided to enter the market with a different business model. “Instead of building a local team, we decided on a strategic partnership with MediaCom.” ‹    Like Save Email Print PDF Advertisement Comment on thisComment Comment guidelines and disclaimer LEGAL DISCLAIMER: This Message Board accepts no liability of legal consequences that arise from the Message Boards (e.g. defamation, slander, or other such crimes).
