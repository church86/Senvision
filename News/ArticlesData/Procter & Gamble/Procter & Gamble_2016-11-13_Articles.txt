Raveena married film distributor Anil Thadani in 2004 and they have two children -- daughter named Rasha and son Ranbirvardhan. Raveena said, "My kids are small to think about films and their interest area. I have kept my kids away from over exposure (of the glamour world) that the other kids are getting, and becoming celebrities on social media much before they become teens. I want them (my kids) to grow as normal kids." With so much interest in the personal life of celebrities, the actress says it does get difficult to keep kids away from media glare. B'day: Raveena Tandon's unknown facts "I don't hide my kids. There is paparazzi around everywhere be it at airports or at school sports function you can't avoid that. But taking kids to premiere (of a film) is something that Anil (husband) and I avoid. There is a right time and age for them to get attention and handle it," she added. The 42-year-old actress said she is strict with her children when it comes to their studies. Raveena supports Seven Seas Academy, an initiative aiming to create awareness about brain development among children. Being a mother to four (two adopted) children, the actress understands the importance of brain development and nutrition for children. "As I am a mother they (Seven Seas Academy) do take my inputs seriously. It's not about selling a product we are genuinely interested in development of a child including brain development and nutritional value. "We all are expecting our kids to be smart but are we giving them proper nutrition, we need to take care of them from the right age," she added. The Seven Seas Academy announced a nationwide hunt for India's young masterminds. At the grand finale, Yuvraj Varma and Ravi Yadav from Chandigarh emerged as India's top masterminds, winning a full paid educational trip to NASA along with parents.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Nov 13, 2016 at 1:26PM Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) knows all about dividend raises. The consumer goods titan has hiked its payout in each of the last sixty years for one of the longest streaks in the stock market. Image source: Getty Images. Yet the rate of increases has gotten much smaller lately. In fact, shareholders haven't seen a boost to the payout rate since 2008, when it improved from 13% to 14%. In contrast, this year's increase was about as tiny as it could be -- less than 1%. Annual dividend raises. Data source: P&G financial filings, chart by author. There are good reasons to expect the dividend outlook to improve from here, though. Falling payout ratio In fiscal 2015, P&G's payout soaked up a dangerously high percentage of profits. The $2.59-per-share dividend swamped the $2.44 per share that the company produced in earnings, leading to a payout ratio significantly above 100%. That unsustainable situation got better over the last 12 months, but only slightly. The dividend amounted to over 70% of earnings in fiscal 2016, far ahead of the 50% figure that most blue-chip businesses aim for. Thus, it made sense for management to be conservative about their latest payout boost. PG Payout Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts. The payout ratio should continue improving even if core earnings don't grow quickly. That's because the two biggest drags against P&G's profits -- foreign currency swings and its brand divestment initiatives -- are both winding down and won't be pressuring reported earnings nearly as much. Faster growth Operating trends are improving as well. Organic sales growth was 1% in the first quarter of the year, rose to 2% in the second quarter, and reached 3% in the quarter that just closed. That momentum bolsters management's forecast calling for P&G's fiscal 2017 to mark its first uptick in annual organic sales growth in three years. Organic growth by calendar quarter. Image source: P&G investor presentation. Notably, the organic growth has been volume-driven lately, meaning that P&G didn't need to count on higher prices alone to pull revenue up. And for a change, the company is finally beating rivals. Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB), which competes with P&G's biggest brand, Pampers, last posted flat organic growth. P&G is still struggling to hold market share overall, but it is gaining share in some key categories, like diapers, and the pace of overall decline has improved. Lower costs P&G can't do much about a sales environment for consumer goods that seems likely to bump along at near zero growth. It has complete control over its costs, though, and that's one area where management has demonstrated great execution. The company has cut an average of $1.4 billion out of its annual cost of goods sold expenses in each of the last five years and executives plan to boost that figure to as much as $2 billion over the next five years. These big-time savings promise to push gross profit margin higher even if the industry logs another year of disappointing growth. And as a fundamentally more profitable business, P&G should be able to afford heftier dividend increases. With dividends taking up more than two-thirds of profits, it's not likely that investors will see a return to double-digit raises any time soon. However, the key financial and operating trends imply stronger growth ahead for patient income investors. In the meantime, brand divestments have left P&G absolutely flush with cash, most of which the company plans to shower on shareholders in the form of stock repurchases.

Subscribe Now Headlines: Press: Why More Women's Magazines Are… TV: Why the Creator of Drunk Histo… Tech: Report: Snapchat's Parent Comp… Ads & Brands: How Marketing Helped Milk-Bone… How This Agency Built Its Own App Using Amazon Echo Voice skills have become big business for Rain By Lauren Johnson November 14, 2016, 4:03 PM EST Technology Rain has picked up a few new clients with its voice expertise. Amazon Last October, New York-based digital agency Rain worked with Campbell's to find a new way to push out the CPG giant's library of recipes, creating one of the first branded "skills" for Amazon's voice-controlled Echo device, which helped consumers find dinner recipes on demand. While the agency expected a bit of a PR boost from the Campbell's work, voice and the so-called Internet of Things has actually become a big growth area for Rain over the past year, as more agencies look for ways to tap into emerging devices for brands. Shortly after creating the Campbell's skill, Rain became one of a handful of Amazon's go-to developers tasked with building "skills"—voice apps that let consumers ask questions to Amazon's AI platform named Alexa. Rain even opened up a small satellite office—albeit with one employee—in Seattle to be closer to Amazon's headquarters. "From an agency level, Amazon helps make some connections with clients," said Greg Hedges, director of strategy at Rain. "People will reach out to Amazon sometimes and then we'll get them to the right people." In the past year, Rain has signed 1-800-Flowers, P&G's Tide, Yahoo Fantasy Football and Liberty Mutual-owned Safeco as clients, helping to build branded skills that dole out information and entertainment to consumers. For Safeco, the agency built a glossary of insurance terms so that consumers can ask Alexa questions like, "What is umbrella insurance?" or "What does liability mean?" For 1-800-Flowers, users can automatically place flower orders to their friends or family members. In addition to building branded skills, Rain is also plugged into Amazon Voice Service, the arm of Amazon's business focused on building Alexa into other devices. As part of that, Rain recently built a smartphone app called Reverb that uses Amazon's API so that anyone can use Alexa—whether or not they have an Echo device. Here's how it works: People download the Reverb iOS or Android app (there's also a website) and log in with an Amazon account. From there, folks are prompted to press a finger on the screen to ask Alexa a question. Just like using Echo, Alexa reads the answer out loud and consumers can then have a back-and-forth conversation with her. For Rain, the app is a way for staffers to tweak and improve the user experience of branded skills when they aren't nearby to use an Echo. "We use it to test our skills," Hedges said. "We are always looking to be on top of moving technologies and make sure that we understand them—building this was part of understanding the platform." Going forward, Rain is looking for ways that marketers can use Reverb. In one scenario, the technology could be built into a branded app for Campbell's, to make it easier for consumers to access recipes without having to press a button. "We've already talked about that," said Hedges. "Amazon democratized the voice experience by opening the door [to voice] and we're helping to further that by opening the Alexa platform up." Hedges said that the agency is working on other ways to build on the initial success of the Campbell's skill, too. "We want to work [on] the ability not to just get the recipe but also extend that cooking experience into getting ingredients [or more information into] the steps." It's not the first time that Rain has hacked Echo. In May, Rain software engineer Octavio Menocal created a skill for playing a simple game of rock, paper scissors. Data informs Rain's investment in Echo. Hedges said that the agency builds Google Analytics into its skills to track stats like how long someone spends with the skill, when they use it, their ZIP code and what questions they ask. "In the Yahoo Fantasy Football app, I can ask for information about a player," Hedges said. "We're not only capturing the fact that someone asked about a player, we're actually capturing information about what specific player they asked for so that we can see which players are most popular." Rain is also keeping its eye on Google Home, the company's new home device that's potentially full of marketing data. In December, Google plans to open up its AI platform—dubbed Google Assistant—for marketers and developers to create similar experiences to Amazon Echo. "We feel like the process that we've honed is applicable to those—while we've built skills, what we've really been building in the end are these larger experiences and then executing them using Alexa," Hedges said.

Decker arrives at CP+B from Omnicom shopper marketing agency The Integer Group of Lakewood, Colorado. He spent over eight years there, most recently serving as VP of insight and strategy and leading planning on the Kellogg, PepsiCo, MillerCoors, and P&G accounts. Before that he spent two years as insights director with 72andSunny, handling strategy and research for various clients including Discovery, Nike, Quiksilver and Roxy. Decker began his career as an ecologist and earned a PhD in urban ecology and human evolution from the University of New Mexico and also spent time at Boulder ethnographic research firm Radar Communications, where he contributed to global research for Intel and Unilever. He has presented on marketing science at SXSW, TED and other events. “What we love most about Ethan is that despite his deep expertise and scientific mind, he’s always willing to throw it all away and invent something completely new,” CP+B chief strategy officer Eric Zuncic, who joined the agency in July of 2015, said in a statement. “His innate sense of curiosity and creativity, backed by the rigor of real scientific analysis is a rare find in our world. Most importantly, our creatives noted that he is the ‘Perfect amount of weird to help us make great work’ – which is about as good a compliment as I’ve ever heard.” < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

WV Delegate Cowles hired to head Morgan County Economic Developm - Business, Government Legal News from throughout WV Member Center: Create Account| Log In Manage Account| Log Out SITE SEARCHWEB SEARCH BY Home News Business Government Energy Law Opinion Lynne D. Schwabe Brooks McCabe Charlie Bowen John Brown Dolly Withrow Linda Arnold Government Law Energy SHOP About Us Job Openings WV Delegate Cowles hired to head Morgan County Economic Development Authority Posted: Thursday, November 10, 2016 6:56 PM EST Updated: Saturday, November 12, 2016 2:00 PM EST By Marla Pisciotta Photo courtesy of Daryl Cowles — Delegate Daryl Cowles, R-Morgan, shown here with his wife Nicole and 4 children, adds Executive Director of Morgan County Development Authority to his resume. Delegate Daryl Cowles, R-Morgan, a 10-year veteran of the Legislature, has taken the executive director position of the Morgan County Economic Development Authority. “There is a lot going on in Berkeley Springs,” the 46-year-old Cowles said. “A lot of plans have been made for development. I am looking forward to getting some of these projects across the finish lines.” Cowles is no stranger to the authority board. He has served on the board for a number of years and said a lot of good things can come from its works — small businesses and county infrastructure can reap the benefits. Some projects in the county are underway and others are in the works. Blue Ridge Community and Technical College now has a campus in Berkeley Springs for work force training and higher education. “We desperately need that in the county,” Cowles said. “It’s a 45-minute drive to Martinsburg. We are glad to have their presence in the county.” Morgan County is developing a partnership with Procter & Gamble to build a lab in the former Pines Center Hospital.  Another big expansion is planned for Cacapon State Park. Related story: Media center grows in Morgan County, WV “Plans are to build 79 new rooms at the lodge, work on the golf course and work on the sewer plant,” Cowles said. He said the sewer plant was authorized three years ago by the Legislature, but Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin has not yet authorized the bond sale. “I think the financial outlook of the state right now is holding up that decision,” Cowles said. “Hopefully finances will straighten out and we’ll be able to get that project done.” The county also is talking with Mountaineer Gas about a natural gas line going into the county. “Currently we have zero natural gas availability in Morgan County,” Cowles said. Cowles said the application for the gas project has been filed with the West Virginia Public Service Commission. Related story: WV House of Delegates passes flood funding bill “Natural gas would allow bigger companies that require that type of energy to consider locating in Morgan County,” Cowles said. Smaller projects in the county include streetscaping in downtown Berkeley Springs, and new Tractor Supply Co. and Dollar General stores have located in the county. A native of Morgan County, Cowles has served on several regional economic groups, including West-pep and Region 9 Planning and Development Council. Cowles also serves as Majority Leader in the House of Delegates for District 58, Morgan and part of Hampshire counties. For the past 26 years, Cowles has managed his family owned construction and masonry firm. “I will be giving up the family business and concentrating on economic development and my job as Delegate,” Cowles said. Cowles is a graduate of Berkeley Springs High School, is married to his wife Nichole and has four children. Follow The State Journal on Facebook and Twitter GovernmentGovernmentMore>> WV Gov.

Stock markets initially took fright, but swiftly bounced back following Trump's victory speech, which was uncharacteristically measured and gracious. The opinion polls once again got it wrong, as did various investment strategist and financial commentators, who predicted a heavy short-term sell-off due to the various uncertainties associated with a Trump presidency. Over the longer term these uncertainties may well come back to haunt financial markets and inflict damage on investors' portfolios. Many of these risks, however, are already well documented, which in turns gives savvy investors the opportunity to Trump-proof their investments. TRUMP WIN COULD BE GAME-CHANGER FOR BONDS Trump's victory could completely change the investment landscape. The president elect has pledged to cut taxes and increase infrastructure spending on America's ageing roads, bridges, power grids and airports. In turn, this is expected to boost company earnings and consumer spending, but ultimately it will widen the US public sector deficit in the years to come, causing inflation to rise and monetary policy to tighten. To add weight to this argument, Trump has in the past criticised the Federal Reserve for keeping interest rates low, describing the move as creating a 'false economy'.  '[Trump's proposals] will result in higher bond yields and a steeper yield curve,' notes Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. Paolini adds that rising inflation and a wider deficit could also spell an end to dollar strength, which according to Pictet's models is already some 20 per cent overvalued on a trade-weighted basis. High-quality bonds with low yields, such as government bonds, will suffer from higher rates and higher inflation. But as Money Observer noted last month, there are various bond inflation insurance policies, including index-linked bond funds or exchanged traded funds. One option, highlight by Psgima's Tom Becket, is the Fidelity Index-Linked Bond fund. Another way to mitigate risk is to consider bond funds that hold bonds with short lifespans - in other words, that are a couple of years away from maturity. Indeed, some bond fund managers, including James Foster at Artemis, have moved to 'short' government bonds in anticipation that the 35-year bond bull market is coming to an end. Investment grade and high yield bonds are better placed to ride the storm. Eoin Walsh, co-manager of the TwentyFour Dynamic Bond fund, makes the point that 'if you own yield in this environment, you should probably hang on to it'. This argument, however, probably doesn't extend to the part of the bond market that offers the highest yields of all - emerging market debt - due to Trump's protectionist agenda. The president-elect has pledged to rip up longstanding trade agreements and impose tariffs on imports. Jim Cielinski, global head of fixed income at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, notes: 'Trump's victory is most worrisome for this asset class. Aside from the obvious risk to the close trading partners of Latin America, and Mexico in particular, China is also a concern. 'Much depends on trade policy, as many emerging market countries are heavily export dependent to America. Do not expect clarity for several more months.' Foster adds that one unknown element is the Chinese reaction to being called 'currency manipulators' by Trump. 'The risk is that they respond by selling their substantial holdings of Treasuries. Who knows, but that clearly would be very damaging for bond yields,' says Foster. FOR EQUITIES A trade war between America and China cannot be ruled out, and under this scenario the US economy could be knocked off course. Certain stocks would also be hit. Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management says potential losers are US multinationals with sales exposure to the Asia Pacific region, including Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson and Nike. Marc Pullen, senior equity analyst at the firm, adds that many companies may also lose out, including those that source parts or even their entire products from China, such as Apple. 'So even those US companies with relatively few sales to China could suffer in terms of profit margins,' says Pullen. The emerging market regions, however, could end up being among the biggest equity market losers. That's a point made by Neil Woodford, who manages the CF Woodford Equity Income fund; he says he expects globalisation to come under the spotlight under a Trump administration, and as a result investors should 'expect a greater focus on domestic political priorities at the expense of free trade and globalisation'. Consumer goods giants, the so-called bond proxies, the likes of Unilever and Diageo, are also tipped to be among the losers, due to the expectation that both interest rates and bond yields will rise. The widely held view is that when the interest rate cycle turns and assets other than equities start to look attractive again, bond proxies will be ditched and their share prices will fall. Sarasin & Partners' Guy Monson says that he now prefers 'local franchises over internationally focused businesses'. Among the winners Monson expects a further recovery in high quality US banks and a sharp recovery in some of the best global pharmaceutical franchises, which had sold off in an anticipation of a Hilary Clinton victory. HOW TO TWEAK YOUR FUND CHOICE There will also be fund winners and losers, and it may pay fund investors to switch to a holding more likely to benefit under Trump's presidency. Jason Hollands, of adviser Tilney Bestinvest, tipped First State Global Listed Infrastructure, Axa Framlington Health and Investec Enhanced Natural Resources. The latter fund, Hollands says, 'could capitalise on demand for raw materials that arises from increased infrastructure spend, but it is important to bear in mind that increase US demand needs to be weighed against a slowdown in demand from China.' But at uncertain times it ultimately pays in the long run to adopt a diversified approach and have a segment of your portfolio in safe havens, such as gold or funds that invest in an extremely cautious manner. Options include Personal Assets and RIT Capital Partners, with the latter being one of Money Observer's Rated Funds. Patrick Gordon, a senior market strategist at Killik, says: 'As with Brexit, it is times like these where diversification is particularly important. It remains difficult to call currency moves and short-term asset price swings, but a diversified portfolio, both by asset class and geography, should help to cushion the impact of heightened volatility.'

It also announced there would be no Chrome ad blocker. Actively-used browsers aren't the same as active users, given that many users rely on Chrome on multiple devices, indeed one of the benefits of using Chrome is that it can easily sync between your devices. But however and wherever you look you'll quickly come to the same conclusion - Chrome has become the ubiquitous and dominant browser. On the desktop it has taken share from Microsoft's Internet Explorer and ensured that Edge has a failed to be adopted despite the efforts made in Windows 10. The fact Chrome is pre-installed on every phone running Google's version of Android certainly gives it a head start in the mobile arena and it also has a healthy share of iOS devices. Here's the latest position from StatCounter across PCs, mobile devices and consoles, showing that Chrome has a 51.53% share of the world-wide market   From NetMarketShare, the latest browser stats for smartphones, tablets and consoles are displayed in this pie chart which shows Chrome's share is 54.30%, with Safari having the only other significant slice (25.66%)   Turning attention to the desktop distribution, Chrome has almost the same proportion (54.41%) and it is Internet Explorer, which is the default browser for Windows 7, the dominant desktop OS that is is second place with 25.48%   NetMarketShare's trend chart over the last 12 months shows clearly how Chrome has increased its dominance at the expense of Internet Explorer: We used to comment on how Firebox was doing - but even though it has rallied a little from its low in August it does seem to have become a lost cause. It will be interesting to see if Edge, which is increasing its tiny share ever edges Firefox out of its third rank position. Meanwhile back at the Chrome Dev Summit, Darin Fisher, vice president of Chrome engineering, told delegates that Google will not be building an ad-blocking feature into Chrome, explaining that it's better to change the behavior of adds rather than block them altogether, a viewpoint undoubtedly motivated by the fact that Google makes a lot of revenue from advertising. Fisher said:  "We feel like there are a lot of challenges in advertising. There are a lot of wrong ways. However, if publishers and advertisers do ads the right way, it can be great for the users and for the ecosystem." Admitting that a lot of advertising hurts engagement by actually deterring people from using websites he referred to a recent initiative, the Coalition for Better Ads that Google has helped to found along with publishers like Facebook, News Corp. and The Washington Post, advertisers like Unilever and Proctor & Gamble, and industry groups like the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) and the Association of National Advertisers (ANA). Fisher also outlined Google's plans to to have Chrome support progressive web apps (PWAs) that deliver a mobile app-like experience within browsers:   "It's expensive to get people to install an app ... but progressive web apps arrive fast through the browser to keep visitors happy, then download extra abilities silently in the background. For website developers there's really no fundamental limit to the kinds of experiences you can create." Firefox and Edge also support PWAs but they are not yet supported by Apple either within Safari or for third-party browsers running on iOS. A lot of attention was paid during the summit to the need for websites to be mobile-friendly, particularly in view of the finding by StatCounter Global Stats that  mobile and tablet devices accounted for 51.3% of Internet usage worldwide in October compared to 48.7% by desktop.     Together with the fact that the Google search algorithm now penalizes web pages that are not mobile-friendly, this is a clear signal  to  web developers not to ignore mobile.        More Information StatCounter Global Stats Netmarketshare Coalition for Better Ads Related Articles Is Chrome Most Prevalent Browser?

Illustration: Jayachandran/Mint When I first met Suketu Talekar in Pune, back in 2009, Brewcrafts Microbrewing Pvt. Ltd, which produces Doolally craft beers, was still making test batches of ales and ciders. As I watched Talekar, then 32, and German head brewer and co-founder Oliver Schauf, whom he met online when he was looking for a partner, haul sacks of malt and hops from the storage room to the brewery, they had to explain to me the basics of how a beer is made. “Beer is, essentially, the shit and piss of yeast,” Talekar, Doolally’s co-founder, had said, guffawing. They had to carefully list the differences between an industrial beer and a craft one, and why the latter was more desirable. As India’s first microbrewery, Doolally’s principal challenge then was simply letting consumers know there was more to beer than Kingfisher and Foster’s. Just seven years later, India has more than 30 microbreweries. If you’re anywhere in Bengaluru, Pune, Gurgaon or Mumbai, you’re not far from a pub that will serve you a craft beer on tap. Even your local wine shop may have bottles of craft beer made by an Indian company. Talekar, who is in charge of Doolally’s marketing and sales—Schauf handles the making of the beer—is neither surprised, nor overly excited, about the rapid growth of a market he helped open up. “If you make a good beer, consumers will love it. That was always a no-brainer for me,” he says. We are sitting at the Doolally Taproom in Bandra, Mumbai, one of three such outlets in the city. The company, which began selling its beers at The Corinthians Resort & Club in Pune in 2009, brought its brews to Mumbai in 2015. The Bandra Taproom, wholly owned and run by Doolally, was their first outlet, and since then, two more have opened, one in Andheri and another at Kemps Corner. These restaurants are perpetually filled with increasingly knowledgeable beer drinkers who don’t even need the menu, let alone an explanation of what craft beer is, to place their order. But the education process has not been completed, says Talekar. “We have moved a long way from walking into a bar and asking just for ‘a beer’. Now, we walk into a bar and ask for a brand and a style—a Gateway Doppelganger or an Independence IPA (India Pale Ale),” he says. “Customers know there are possibilities of beer beyond Kingfisher and Foster’s. But really understanding what those possibilities are, that is an ongoing process.” "Among light, session beers, Talekar’s favourite styles are Gose, a salty, tarty German beer; Saison, which is easy to drink; the English bitter; and the English brown ale, particularly Hobgoblin, made by the Wychwood Brewery Company. Among challenging styles, he loves Indian Pale Ales, Belgian Tripels and Porters."- As that process continues, Talekar expects the industry to grow to a size that will dwarf what is now being heralded as a craft-beer boom. The US has seen the number of microbreweries reach nearly 5,000, even though the first one opened only in the late 1970s, he says. At this early stage in India, he sees other microbreweries more as allies than as competitors. “More players means more perspective on the product. It means more experimentation. It means consumers holding brewers to a higher standard, which means improvement on the product.” And he is impressed with the quality of entrepreneurs entering the craft beer industry, something he thinks will be critical to the pace it grows at. “People are making conservative estimates about the market for craft beer because they are underestimating the quality of the entrepreneurs entering this market. I believe there is a qualitative difference between the early bunch of winemakers and the early bunch of craft-beer makers. I will put my money behind a statement that in five years, craft beer will be 2x or 3x bigger than the wine industry. Which would mean that in 10 years, we would have done what the wine guys haven’t managed to do in 25 years. And that’s because of the quality of the entrepreneurs.” One of the stumbling blocks for the craft-beer industry has been the red tape one has to navigate to begin making craft beer and, then, package it in a way that is profitable. A number of breweries have complained that without being allowed to bottle their beers, they are left with too few revenue streams to break even. Talekar thinks the extent of these problems is overstated. Doolally has joined hands with a few other breweries to form the Maharashtra Craft Brewers Association, and they are seeking, among other things, permission from the excise department to sell beer in growlers (air-tight jugs used to store beer) at brewpubs. “It will be like parcelling beer, like you parcel food at a restaurant,” Talekar explains. Someday, he would also like to see Doolally beers sitting in bottles in stores. But at the moment he is not fixated on finding new ways to package and sell his beer. Rather, his days are spent managing Doolally’s Taprooms and ensuring that he “wins with every consumer who walks in”. Doolally’s Taprooms have become popular in Mumbai as places for relaxed get-togethers. They are brightly lit, unlike other pubs; the music is soft, allowing conversation; and the walls are lined with shelves full of books and board games, suggesting this is a place you will not be hurried in. Talekar understands that the context in which he sells his beer is as important as the product. “We believe that people don’t come here to eat and drink. They come here for something else. They come here to spend time with friends, someone they love or their colleagues. It’s like an extension of their living rooms.” Born in Gujarat’s Bhavnagar and schooled in Nashik, Talekar did a course in production engineering from the Jawaharlal Nehru College in Aurangabad. After a stint with his father’s company, which did sales and after-sales service of diesel engines, Talekar completed his master’s in business administration from the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, in 2004. He then worked as an assistant brand manager with Procter & Gamble in Singapore. He had always been a beer drinker, but had never drunk truly good beer until he began frequenting a brewpub named Brewerkz there. He returned to India a year later with the idea of bringing good beer to his home country. His conservative family wasn’t too happy; they didn’t think “decent” people should be dealing in liquor. After a decade-long journey with BrewCrafts Microbrewing/Doolally, Talekar is doing things he had never imagined he would. Such as managing a pub. “We only began running our first 18 months ago, and now we have three, without raising any money. What I’ve learnt in this time is that there is no greater marketing tool than experiential retail. You can actually moderate how a person feels. That’s why every Apple store is worth a hundred million dollars that Microsoft spends on advertising.” Doolally’s beer sales have grown 400% since 2014 and their total revenue has increased by 1,000% in the same period. They’ve also added to their staff, currently at around 180, and have moved from working out of the Taprooms to an office in Santacruz. With this pace of growth, employees come to work every day knowing they are going to have to face new challenges, which is why Talekar sees his role as that of a cheerleader. “I believe in letting people be. I think that if you recruit right, then your job is to create conditions that will let people succeed and give them the leeway to make decisions and mistakes too. It’s natural when you are doing so many new things for morale to dip at times. My job is to get everyone excited about the big picture.” Dustin Silgardo Topics: Suketu TalekarDoolally craft beersMicrobreweriesPuneOliver Schauf More from this Section How Walnut mobile app can help you find an ATM that is active App Radar: Must-have new apps and games for Android and iOS Review: Blueair Blue Pure 211 is a breath of fresh air Best ways to filter the bad air Cut your diabetes risk Editor's Picks The cash withdrawal, currency exchange challenge at rural bank branches Subbarao warns RBI against taking unclaimed notes as profit Demonetization to help check tax evasion through penny stocks The economics of currency reform Donald Trump’s threat to Indian IT is all bluster First Published: Fri, Nov 11 2016. 12 51 PM IST Latest News Helping consumers win the telecom wars Thailand’s lessons for the healthcare system Donald Trump brings uncertainties for India Editor's Picks The cash withdrawal, currency exchange challenge at rural bank branches Subbarao warns RBI against taking unclaimed notes as profit Demonetization to help check tax evasion through penny stocks Latest News Helping consumers win the telecom wars Thailand’s lessons for the healthcare system Donald Trump brings uncertainties for India The economics of currency reform The two-step Trump dance Mint On Sunday The priceless legacy of P.L.

Conducted by Pampers in association with AC Nielsen, the survey -- which had a sample size of 432 parents (216 mothers) of children up to three years of age in Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata -- highlights how the involvement of both the mother and the father is extremely crucial for the cognitive, social as well as the emotional development of the baby. It is conducted in correspondence with Pampers' latest campaign 'It Takes Two' (#ItTakes2) that talks about the importance of both mother and father's involvement in wholesome development of the baby. The results of the survey indicate that 97 per cent of the mothers said it takes two to raise a happy and healthy baby, and 90 per cent of the women surveyed said they want their husbands to be more involved in baby care. As many as 88 per cent of the mothers agreed that their husbands hesitate to change diapers. Among the men, 88 per cent of them said baby chores primarily need only the mother's involvement. Commenting on the survey, a P&G Spokesperson said: "The survey brings forth the fact that a happy, healthy baby needs active participation from both mom and dad, right from Day one. Paediatricians and child psychologists also agree that involvement of the mother as well as the father towards baby care has a direct correlation towards better cognitive and social development of the baby. "The results thus pose a very interesting question to all the young parents out there, If #ItTakes2 to make a baby, shouldn't It Take 2 to raise a baby?" --IANS rb/dg SEARCH About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2016.

Cosmetics, books, baby goods, electronics, pharmaceutical products, fresh produce, clothing and mobile phones all recorded huge sales during this year’s event, according to data released by Alibaba, whose main shopping platforms are Taobao Marketplace, TMall, and AliExpress. But in terms of the top individual brands, a broad representation from various categories of retailers stole the show. Japanese clothing brand Uniqlo, home appliance major Midea, mobile handsets brand Honor and Guangdong-based furniture maker Linsy were among the most popular sellers with sales each surpassing 100 million yuan within the first half hour of the shopping event. FMCG spans everything from infant formula to soft drinks and beauty products, and China’s annual online spending volume last year shot up to US$25.3 billion from US$1.4 billion in 2010, according to market researcher Euromonitor International. As Chinese urban dwellers rely more on e-commerce for their daily necessities to save time and money, online sales of packaged foods, alcoholic drinks and personal care products are expected to record exponential growth in the years to come, a recent survey by London-based consultancy OC&C found. The report showed while large grocery sales in China still have lower online penetration than the other categories, as well as tech-savvy millennials, those aged between 30 and 50 said they would be opting to buy daily necessities online in the coming six months. “The growing middle classes want to save money on everyday consumables so they can use these savings towards a better lifestyle including for dining out or buying international fashion brands,” said Jack Chuang, Partner, Greater China, OC&C Strategy Consultant. “As their appetite for premium and healthy products rises, consumers are also seeking to order imported foods and drinks online if they can’t find them in local hypermarkets or corner stores. That has prompted Alibaba to put Borges olive cooking oil from Spain, Ocean Spray raisins from US, and Haribo gummy candy from Germany – essentially the Western snacks barely seen across Chinese urban neighbourhoods – on sale in its online supermarket. “Chinese consumers are eager to try something new, and they always favour brands they consider more reliable,” said Joerg Wolle, CEO of Swiss market expansion giant DKSH Holding which recently purchased a major stake in eSweets, a Shanghai-based distributor of high-end consumer goods such as Lindt chocolate and Illy Coffee. The grocery market space, from soy sauce to shampoo, is becoming an emerging billion dollar battleground for Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and its chief rival JD.com as they hunt for new revenue growth in China. The war is likely to be costly and any victory will be hard fought, with rock bottom prices no longer the only key to success in e-commerce. Rather, it will be the quality of goods that entice China’s rising middle classes who are thirsty for Fiji water and hungry for European biscuits. It will also bring about change to the shopping habits of millions of Chinese, most of whom are accustomed to ordering clothes and home electronics online, but would still walk to a convenience store or supermarket for their daily necessities. The war escalated in the three weeks leading up to Alibaba’s November 11 Singles’ Day online shopping extravaganza when Wal-Mart Stores joined with JD.com to set up a Beijing online store to deliver imported goods to Chinese shoppers “within hours”. On the same day in Hong Kong, Alibaba spotlighted its alliance with giant US warehouse retailer Costco Wholesale, and other grocery brands like Procter & Gamble, as part of its Singles’ Day promotions that included coupons, discounts and offering products not yet available in China. The pacts with Western consumer multinationals were part of a multibillion dollar campaign rolled out by Alibaba, owner of the South China Morning Post, as it vowed to outspend its rivals to gain an upper hand in the unfolding grocery war. “While [JD.com] is talking about US$1 billion investments, we are willing to invest multi-times that number because this is a category we think we should be in as it has great potential,” Alibaba’s chief financial officer Maggie Wu said in a call with analysts in August. In the second quarter earnings result, Alibaba singled out its Tmall online supermarket as a business that scored a stellar “triple digit sales volume growth”. JD’s grocery revenue soared 70 per cent over the first quarter of the year, while Alibaba’s online supermarket, currently the largest nationwide, more than tripled its sales for the same period. “Without question, fast-moving consumer goods are where Alibaba and JD.com’s future growth lies, with home appliances and clothing e-commerce in China approaching saturation,”said Hu Chuncai, Shanghai-based general manager with retail management consultancy Shangyi Consulting. A price war between the two titans have also erupted, and intensified. In early September, Alibaba’s Tmall Supermarket spent an estimated 180 million yuan on offering 50 per cent discounts in time sensitive deals in Beijing and Shanghai, firing back at similar sales promotions at the grocery division of JD.com, with the Beijing-based e-commerce firm promising to make its online grocery store “second to none” within three years. “But the chance is slim for JD to live up to that pledge, given that Alibaba has already gained a position of dominance particularly in southwest and northwest China,” said Shangyi Consulting’s Hu. The OC&C survey of 4,600 Chinese urbanites found that Alibaba’s Tmall and sister e-commerce site Taobao achieved the highest brand awareness and shopper penetration across major grocery categories, from infant formula to alcoholics drinks. But China’s online grocery market is also more fragmented, as Alibaba commands a 52 per cent market share versus a 70 per cent it controls of the overall online retail landscape in the country, according to OC&C. Alibaba’s chief executive Zhang Yong noted in a recent interview that winning consumers and success in China’s online grocery market also called for a “full embracing of offline channels”. “A partnership with bricks-and-mortar retailers will allow shoppers to place orders online and collect items in person at a store nearby, which will serve as part of the grocery delivery network,”said Hu, Driving down logistics costs would considerably fatten profit margins of grocery e-commerce, where package shipping can be more “costly” compared with bigger ticket items such as apparel and home appliances. While JD tries to utilise Wal Mart’s extensive distribution channels across cities as it reinforces its cooperation with the US supermarket giant, Alibaba’s logistics affiliate Cainiao managed to reduce shopping time by launching grocery delivery centres across China’s most populous cities. In June, Alibaba invested 5 billion yuan in a partnership with white goods retailer Suning Commerce Group, linking its online shopping platforms to the latter’s over 1,600 outlets 5,500 after-sales service points in China. Although e-commerce powerhouses are now making an all-out effort to make online purchases of toothpastes and potato chips easier than ever, patience is needed for Chinese consumers to really overhaul their grocery shopping patterns, experts reckon. “It will take time, probably a few years,”said OC&C’s Chuang, “and the shift will be on a gradual basis.” Additional reporting by Eric Ng This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: FMCG goods lead shopping surge of Chinese consumers   Most Popular Viewed 1 Trump’s America: the good, the bad and the ugly 2 RIP: Hong Kong’s shopping industry, as e-retailers tighten their grip 3 Modi’s key aide blames poor planning for India’s currency crisis 4 Don’t overestimate Hong Kong’s importance on Beijing’s legislative and governing agenda 5 For couriers living in fear of Singles’ Day, the week after is a bonanza of extra pay Shared 1 Don’t overestimate Hong Kong’s importance on Beijing’s legislative and governing agenda 2 Trump’s America: the good, the bad and the ugly 3 RIP: Hong Kong’s shopping industry, as e-retailers tighten their grip 4 Modi’s key aide blames poor planning for India’s currency crisis 5 Alibaba bets big on cloud expansion to drive global growth Commented 1 Beijing’s top man in Hong Kong accuses Legco localists of treating community like ‘idiots’ 2 China’s first female pilot of J-10 fighter jets dies in an air accident 3 Trump’s America and Hong Kong’s oath taking crisis: how they are linked 4 Walking a mile in Beijing’s shoes could serve Hong Kong politicians well in future 5 Hong Kong woman latest victim of online love scam after losing HK$880,000 to ‘British lover’ Promotions Register for a free copy of XXIV 2017 now Register for a free copy of Home Essentials 2017 now       You may also like China Pacific Rim nations urged to revise TPP without US before Trump cuts trade ties 12 Nov 2016 - 12:29am 15 Mirror mirror on the wall: Talking mirrors in bathrooms of the future tailor made for media consumption In partnership with: HKT PREMIER Society Why China’s rise means Hong Kong stars like Jackie Chan will be the last of their kind 13 Nov 2016 - 7:23pm 14 Northern wonder: explore Ha Long Bay’s natural beauty, within easy reach from Hanoi Presented by Go Asia-Vietnam Hong Kong Despite fears, new air traffic control system to be launched at Hong Kong airport on Monday 11 Nov 2016 - 11:26pm 3 Hong Kong Did CY Leung mess up his own oath?

It’s a fascinating trend: bosses inviting tech-savvy youngsters to be their mentors. So did it work for top advertising executive Kate?  Kate Stanners finds out if a 25-year-old can help run her life She is chairwoman and global chief creative officer of Saatchi & Saatchi The exective is being reverse mentored by Lucy Lyall Grant By Liz Hoggard for the Daily Mail Published: 18:35 EST, 13 November 2016 | Updated: 19:33 EST, 13 November 2016 e-mail 240 shares 307 View comments Kate Stanners is chairwoman and global chief creative officer of Saatchi & Saatchi Kate Stanners oozes confidence and charisma. Dressed in trousers and a jumper by designer Bella Freud, her blonde curls tumbling over her shoulders, the 53-year-old looks like a Hollywood actress (although, as a working mother, she has little time to worry about her appearance). As chairwoman and global chief creative officer of Saatchi & Saatchi, she commands a six-figure salary and is one of the most senior women in British advertising. Her adverts include the Cadbury Flake ‘girl in the bath’ and T-Mobile’s ‘Royal Wedding ad’ — the most viewed of 2011. One minute, she’s briefing an art director on how to improve a campaign, the next juggling school commitments for her 13-year-old son, Otto, and organising her mother’s 80th birthday. It is, she says, important to wrap the presents herself. But, like many older bosses, she has one increasingly conspicuous weakness. She’s hopeless when it comes to tech. ‘I’m of the generation of women where you didn’t learn to type because, if you did, that would mean you were going to be a secretary. It was a rebellion not to,’ she says, then admits: ‘Everyone laughs because I’m absolutely inept technically.’ Partly, it’s impatience. But also, she says, it’s patronising to tell women over 50 to ‘keep up’. ‘Technology is there to make life easier, isn’t it? When it’s making life more complicated, either you’re doing something wrong or the technology isn’t very good — so you don’t need to worry about it.’ RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Marrying my 'crazy' Earl helped me overcome being raped: The...

Share this article Share 240 shares But she also sees the irony of a situation where smart fiftysomething women who run multi-million-pound business empires are stumped when booking a blow-dry by app, or changing their credit card details on taxi app Uber. And she also recognises how getting savvier about tech can free up valuable family time. Which is why today — for one day only — she is handing over the bossing baton to a 25-year-old upstart who knows virtually nothing about advertising. Kate has agreed to try out reverse mentoring, the latest trend to which more and more top bosses are signing up. Many of us have had ‘mentors’ in our lives, of course — but, generally, they’re older than us. ‘Reverse mentoring’ flips this idea on its head: young people, often in their 20s, offer training and advice to older workers. The idea is that those much younger than us can shake up our entrenched views and offer a new approach to problem-solving. And, crucially, reverse mentoring can plug the generational knowledge gap when it comes to technology — as anyone who has begged their teenage kids to help them set up a flat-screen TV knows all too well. Picturred, Saatchi exectuive Kate Stanner and Free Formers Mentor Lucy Lyall Grant Over the past two years or so, companies such as L’Oreal, Starbucks, Deloitte and John Lewis have all started pairing up millennials with workers in their 40s or 50s to give them a fresh way of thinking. In 2013, Barclays, for example, ordered 10,000 iPads for staff, only to find no one knew how to use them. They had to set up teams of younger ‘digital eagles’ to coach the older staff. So successful has reverse mentoring become that a new breed of twentysomething mentors has sprung up, who will come into your office and train you to think digitally. And new research shows women are benefiting most from the formal face-to-face schemes than any other digital training. Kate’s mentored many young women in advertising, but she’s not used to those fresh-faced millennials telling her what to do. It could be an awkward moment when she meets her reverse mentor, 25-year-old Lucy Lyall Grant. But armed with a big smile, Lucy quickly puts Kate at her ease. Dressed in jeans, stripey T-shirt and Nike trainers with a pair of headphones round her neck, Lucy speaks fluent tech (in both French and English). A trainer at a digital training company called Freeformers — which counts bosses at Barclays, Tesco and the BBC as former clients — she is at the beginning of her career. She rents a tiny house with three female friends and is on call 24/7 (social media never sleeps). As her company has no formal offices, she either works remotely from home or in a coffee shop. What’s so great about a reverse mentoring session, she explains, is that ‘I can help older workers with the newest apps and train them to be more “techy”. I help them re-organise their life.’ Gently, Lucy explains why Kate needs to engage more with social media. She finds Twitter a great tool for networking Lucy also shows them how to protect themselves against fraud. ‘They understand the importance of data, so want to know about cyber security and passwords. They want to know how to better use their iPhone and book more things online (food, flights, shopping, banking) to save time.’ Funnily enough, she adds, the CEOs with families want to learn more about tech ‘to wow their kids or, at least, better understand what their kids are doing online’. The first thing Lucy does with Kate is look at her office, full of art books, discarded computer equipment and advertising awards. Kate’s a self-confessed messy thinker. ‘I’ve always excused myself that I haven’t got a very efficient brain.’ Lucy is meeting Kate at a time of peak chaos in her life. She, her husband and her 13-year-old son, Otto, along with their wire fox terrier, Rocky, are living in a temporary house while they wait to move home. Meanwhile, Saatchi’s is moving into new, state-of-the-art offices on the other side of London, so everything is being packed up. Never the most organised person — her mantra is ‘I’m better in the moment than in the preparation’ — Kate knows she relies too much on her son. Even when he was very little, Otto learned to stand at the door and say to her: ‘Phone, Oyster card, keys, credit card’, knowing she’d have forgotten one of them. ‘Poor thing, having to worry about your mother being so disorganised,’ she admits. Otto’s also leagues ahead of his mother when it comes to tech. At Saatchi’s, Kate increasingly has to do interviews via video-calling service Skype and often views the latest adverts on her iPhone, but she still watches in awe as Otto sorts out the ringer on his grandmother’s smartphone. Kate needs her phone to be more of a PA, Lucy observes: ‘There is actually an online PA now called x.ai (https://x.ai/), which our own boss at Freeformers uses. She’s called Amy and she’s good at organising meetings, etc. ‘The best thing I do on my own phone is set automatic reminders for meetings, events, holidays, etc. It sends me reminders ten minutes before any event, so I never forget. WHAT YOU COULD LEARN SAVE MONEY: Cash-strapped millennials make their money work harder. Try the Skyscanner app (free from the Apple App Store) to find the cheapest deal for flights on the day/time you want to travel — it scans every airline option; Airbnb for cheap accommodation in the UK and abroad; Splitwise, which, once a group such as a book club or school PTA is signed up, keeps a tally of any money due or owed.  Individuals can settle bills by PayPal. FIX ANYTHING VIA YOUTUBE: Video-sharing website YouTube is brilliant for practical advice on just about anything.  Just type in ‘How do I fix my dishwasher?’ or ‘How do I change my smoke alarm battery?’ and someone will most likely have filmed and uploaded a step-by-step guide. BECOME MORE ORGANISED: The Trello app (free from the Apple App Store) organises all your projects into ‘boards’ in one place on your phone.  In one glance, Trello shows you what’s being done and who’s doing what and when, helping you juggle work, family and social diaries. SUPERMARKET IN YOUR POCKET: Use your favourite supermarket’s app, rather than its website, to do your weekly shop.  They’re updated more often to make them more userfriendly for customers. It should remember your favourites, so that you don’t have to re-select each time, and will also start to predict your behaviour. It also automatically collects loyalty points, so saves you money in the long run. FIND YOUR PHONE HASSLE-FREE: If you misplace your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch or any Apple computer, the Find My iPhone app will let you use any Apple iOS device to find it.  At the click of the button, the app will make the lost phone play a loud sound for two minutes. You can also remotely lock the device to protect your data. NEVER FORGET A PASSWORD: The website LastPass (lastpass.com) keeps all of your accounts safe and remembers your passwords for you. You just need to remember one secure password to log in to LastPass, ‘I also use Citymapper, which tells you the best bus and rail links to get in major cities. As a trainer, I have meetings every day, so I have to be on the ball with transport.’ I’m impressed by the way Lucy respectfully quizzes Kate about her working day. It turns out that, after rising at 6am, Kate takes calls on her mobile from agency offices around the world, walks the dog, takes her son to school, has a breakfast meeting, then walks to the office. Most days, her schedule is crammed with meetings with major clients (such as Asda, HSBC, Procter & Gamble and Visa) and doing ‘creative reviews’ with colleagues globally. Kate says, these days, her job is more about flying to meet people, rather than sitting in front of a screen, so her phone is her lifeline — but Lucy still thinks she’s not using it to maximum effect. If Kate used apps on her smartphone (which you can download from the Apple App Store), she could do everything from personal banking to booking Otto’s after-school clubs while sitting at the airport. ‘Using apps on the go allows you to be more productive and, better yet, to multi-task!’ explains Lucy. ‘You can balance doing work/life admin from any location, whether at home or during your son’s football match. ‘Becoming digital allows you to work remotely. You can be at home more and plan more around your family’s schedule. It’s all about prioritising and freeing up your time. Tech allows you to spend less time doing admin, and more time doing the things you love through simple, quick transactions.’ The problem, Kate admits, is that tech doesn’t always feel like fun to women of her age. Even social media feels like a chore, especially if you hate posting every detail of your personal life to followers. ‘It feels too much like self-promotion,’ she says. Kate has a minimal Twitter presence, recently had to delete an imposter Instagram account (when someone pretended to be her) and often feels guilty about neglecting Facebook. ‘I’m on the site just to be aware of what my friends are doing and where they are in the world,’ she says. ‘It keeps you connected. But if I became more active, I’ll just let people down by missing something.’ Gently, Lucy explains why Kate needs to engage more with social media. She finds Twitter a great tool for networking. ‘You never know who you’ll be collaborating with in the future.’ While it’s estimated that, by 2020, millennials will represent half the global workforce (so we can’t ignore them!), we also need to value our own skills. Age and experience still count, Kate stresses. If you’re older, you know the shortcuts that can save days of research. She cites a report published by the Future Laboratory in 2014, which found that ‘silver entrepreneurs’ are behind Britain’s self-employment boom — businesses founded by over-50s had a 70 per cent chance of lasting five years, compared with 28 per cent for younger entrepreneurs. Kate’s own mother did a master’s degree at 45 after the kids had grown up, she adds. Session over, Kate is keen to meet Lucy again. Despite a madly busy diary, she can see the value of listening to a new voice: millennials are flexible, open-minded and love feedback. They talk about themselves as ‘a brand’, invent their own job titles and never eat lunch alone (why miss out on a chance for some informal networking?). But twentysomethings so competent can make baby-boomers feel redundant. ‘Sitting with 20-year-olds, I constantly think: “Am I remotely relevant to the conversation I am having with you right now?”,’ admits Kate. ‘You constantly question what value you add. But I’m always of the opinion, just keep being curious. It’s OK to make a total twit of yourself!’ And, as she dashes off to two more meetings, Lucy catches the bus back to her West London houseshare.

President-Elect Trump: Should Investors Be Concerned? Presidents And Other Prominent Figures Who Passed On Huge Salaries Like Trump Says He Will There's More To Small-Cap ETF Surge, Large-Cap Woes Than Trump Alone (Investor's Business Daily) The S&P 500 has been surprisingly stable following the shocking election of Donald Trump on Tuesday. Despite the overall stability, Trump’s election has certainly had an impact on a number of traders. International stocks, hospital stocks, gun stocks and gold stocks have been hammered. Prison stocks, drug stocks and bank stocks have soared. PreMarket Prep hosts Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick discussed the ways the Trump election has impacted traders on Friday morning’s show. Dick started out by talking about the difficulties statistical arbitrage traders have had this week. “If you are doing stat/arb here in the last couple of days, you are getting run over. I have backed off on a lot of different stat/arb strategies because I realize they aren’t working right now in this Trump market,” Dick said. Statistical arbitrage isn't the only popular strategy that is falling flat. “I do a lot of mean reversion as well. That is not working either because these trends are very, very pesky,” Dick added. He noted that his short on Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC), which spiked from $17 to $19 in two sessions this week, isn’t even working. Sturm Ruger & Company Inc (NYSE: RGR) is another mean reversion trade that has killed traders this week. After the stock plummeted 14.4 percent Wednesday, it dropped another 12 percent on Thursday and has barely bounced so far in early Friday trading. Dick mentioned Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) and Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) as two other mean regression trades that haven’t worked in the Trump market. “When it’s straight down on the move like that, it’s tough to make money as a trader,” he concluded. Elconin said that the best thing traders can do when one strategy isn’t working in the market is switch things up. “When something’s not working, try and cut bait,” Elconin advised. “Also try and look at some new strategies… Eventually things are going to calm down.” You can hear the entire discussion starting at 2:13 in the clip below.

It will take them some time to get over that; and some considerable time to figure out how they can fight back, as members of a party that doesn’t control either the executive or legislative branches of government – and are looking warily at what might happen to the judicial branch. It's a tough pill to swallow. But, at least in Hamilton County, Democrats have one beacon of light. They now live in a county that is pretty darned blue. Tuesday's election results made it clear. We always scratch our heads when we see writers in national publications or talking heads on the cable news networks talk about Hamilton County being a "Republican stronghold." Are they confusing us with Hamilton County, Tennessee? This county has been changing slowly but steadily from red to purple to blue for the last several decades. The last time a Republican presidential candidate won Hamilton County was in 2004, when President George W. Bush came out on top. Since then, the county has lost about 40,000 people and we're guessing that many of them were urban and suburban Republicans who ended up moving to places like Butler and Warren counties, or Northern Kentucky, or who retired and took up residence in sunny climes such as Florida or Arizona. At any rate, they’re gone. And they took their GOP votes with them. The transformation to a blue county is pretty much complete. Consider: -        While she was losing Ohio as a whole, Clinton won Hamilton County Tuesday night with 52.5 percent of the unofficial vote – marking the third presidential election in a row where the Democratic presidential candidate has won the county. -        Democrat Denise Driehaus' win over Republican incumbent Dennis Deters in a race for Hamilton County commissioner – combined with Democratic incumbent Todd Portune's easy re-election victory Tuesday – gives the Democrats a majority on the three-member county commission for only the second time in over 40 years. -        Counting Driehaus and Portune, Democrats won five of eight contested races for county offices – Aftab Pureval for clerk of courts, Jim Neil re-elected sheriff, and Lakshmi Sammarco re-elected coroner. The only losses among the county offices for the Democrats were county prosecutor, where incumbent Republican Joe Deters was re-elected; county treasurer, where Robert Goering won re-election; and county recorder, where Democratic incumbent Wayne Coates was ousted by former judge Norbet Nadel. And this is probably the most amazing thing of all: On Tuesday night, Hamilton County Democrats beat candidates named Deters and Winkler. Various members of the Winkler family have been winning judicial offices for nearly 50 years. But Tuesday night, a 34-year-old political newcomer named Aftab Pureval came along and knocked off Tracy Winkler, the clerk of courts, whose campaign ran into a buzz saw when City Beat obtained and published e-mails from her chief bailiff pushing employees of the office to get involved in the re-election campaign. Some employees felt threatened by the e-mails. At any rate, it became a great campaign issue for Pureval, a lawyer for Procter & Gamble whose parents are immigrants from India and Tibet. And he struck gold again with campaign TV ads featuring the candidate and a duck puppet that would pop up now and then to squawk "Aftab!" Just like the duck in the Aflac commercials. A great way to sell an unfamiliar name; and it worked. And then there was Driehaus beating Dennis Deters, the youngest brother of the county prosecutor. Deters got into the race rather late; he was appointed in December after incumbent Republican Greg Hartmann suddenly quit the county commission. By that time, Driehaus, a term-limited state representative, already had plenty of money in the bank and she ended up outspending her opponent. We asked Hamilton County Republican Party chairman Alex Triantafilou if Hamilton County was now a blue county. He was very frank in his response. "Yes,'' he said. "When I saw the numbers coming in Tuesday, there was no doubt. I've known it was headed in this direction since I became chairman eight years ago." As far as the presidential campaign is concerned, Triantafilou said the Trump campaign simply didn't have a grassroots ground game in Hamilton County that could match Clinton. That, Triantafilous said, is why four years ago, Mitt Romney – while losing Hamilton County to Barack Obama – had 193,000 votes in Hamilton County compared to about just under 170,000 for Trump on Tuesday. "Joe Deters led the Republican ticket in Hamilton County and he ended up with about 35,000 more votes than Donald Trump did,'' Triantafilou said. Actually, in Tuesday's unofficial results, the difference between Joe Deters and Trump was 36,485. Even Dennis Deters, who lost his race for county commission, had 19,150 more votes than Trump in Hamilton County. "Trump was never going to win this county,'' Triantafilou said. "Hillary had the ground game going. "Our people turned out,'' the county GOP chairman said. "There just wasn't enough of them." It was not, however, a complete disaster, Triantafilou said. Obviously, Trump won Ohio; and U.S. Senator Rob Portman of Terrace Park coasted to re-election. The GOP, he said, will do some soul-searching after this election – not to mention some candidate-searching. There are elections for Cincinnati mayor and Cincinnati council next year, as well as nearly every suburban community in the county. "We're going to evaluate where our votes were and then try to find great candidates to run,'' Triantafilou said. Triantafilou said the Hamilton County Republican Party has plenty of young, up-and-coming potential stars out in the suburban communities, "but they're not getting much attention. The media focuses on Cincinnati races." Hamilton County Democratic Party chairman Tim Burke said it is "obvious the county is getting bluer all the time." "There are some people moving back into the city now who are not necessarily Democrats, but we still dominate the city's politics,'' Burke said. The election of Trump, Burke said, left a lot of Democrats either angry, depressed or both. But, he said, "in Hamilton County, we have a lot to celebrate too."   Tags:  Hamilton County Democratic Party General Election 2016 Hamilton County 2016 presidential election Howard Wilkinson Politics TweetShareGoogle+Email View the discussion thread. © 2016 WVXU Cincinnati Public Radio Program Schedule Our Community Calendar Contact Us WVXU's Democracy and Me for Educators Privacy Policy and Terms of Use

Home > News By Company > Future Market Insights Tweet   Trends in the FMCG Packaging Market 2014-2020 Future Market Insights has announced the addition of the FMCG Packaging Market: Global Industry Analysis and Opportunity Assessment 2014 - 2020 report to their offering.   (EMAILWIRE.COM, November 13, 2016 ) Fast-moving consumer goods are the high volume, low priced items that are quickest to leave the supermarket shelves. They include durable and non-durable goods such as cosmetics, toiletries, detergents, batteries, plastic goods, paper products, etc. Packaging is vital to the FMCG market as it is an essential element for proper positioning of the product. Packaging allows effective communication between consumers and brand owners through graphics, colours, images, product information and logos. This serves as an important medium for communication and a tool for companies to distinguish product appearance from that of their rivals. In the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector, packaging plays a key role in affecting consumer choice and thus an important factor in point-of-purchase decisions. Nowadays, the marketing environment has become competitive and complex. This is due to inclusion of modern marketing tools such as packaging, branding and other aspects at a large scale as compared to basic marketing techniques. In order to enhance product visibility in the market, packaging has emerged as a unique tool to create a direct impact on consumer perception about the corresponding product. Factors such as increasing middle-class population in developing countries, changing consumer lifestyles and technological advancements to develop eco-friendly packaged products are expected to drive the demand for FMCG packaging in the near future. Furthermore, changing consumer lifestyles support the demand for varied consumer products which is expected to enhance the growth of this market. This has led to differentiated packaging which indirectly affects manufacturers. However, compliance of stringent environmental regulations related to packaging is a key factor restraining the market growth. Creation of new materials with the help of sustainable packaging to offer efficient designs is a key trend driving the FMCG packaging market. Request for sample report: http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-110 The FMCG packaging market is segmented on the basis of packaging type and end-user industries. The various types of packaging materials based on the type of product include protective packaging, flexible packaging, paper-based packaging, rigid plastic packaging, custom packaging and others. These packaging materials face challenges due to sourcing based on parameters like health consciousness, mobility and consumerism in pharmaceutical and health products. Shift in global buying patterns of consumers coupled with a surge for value-added products has led to an increase in consumer willingness for premium products. Thus, to target the consumer spending for packaging, companies are focusing on developing attractive packaging products. FMCG packaging serves end-user industries, such as food, beverages, healthcare, cosmetics and others. Among all the end-user industries, the food & beverages sector serves as the largest market for packaging companies to invest in the long run. The demand for packaging in recent years is being recognized across the emerging markets with developed markets retaining their market share with a modest growth. However, demand from emerging markets is expected to record a double-digit growth in the next five to six years. Packaging in the FMCG sector accounts for a large share in the material cost involved in developing a finished product. Thus companies at a global level are developing innovative packaging solutions to minimize the operational cost. The FMCG packaging market is highly fragmented when analysed from the supply side perspective with less number of companies having a substantial share in the total market. This leads to less entry barriers for new entrants in this market. However, skilled labour, equipment and machinery are identified as barriers for a sustainable growth in the near future. Nestlé S.A., Procter & Gamble Company and PepsiCo Inc. are among the leading FMCG companies across the globe. Other prominent players of the FMCG packaging market include Kimberly-Clark, Altria Group, Kraft Foods, Mondel?z International Inc., Philip Morris International Inc., Unilever Group, Amcor Limited and Tetra Pak International.
