U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said the nearly $15 billion deal “adequately and fairly” compensates consumers and gets the polluting vehicles off the road as soon as possible. The German automaker acknowledged last year that about 475,000 Volkswagens and Audis with 2-litre, four-cylinder diesel engines were programmed to cheat on emissions tests. ___ Despite warnings, extremely dangerous air bags not repaired DETROIT (AP) — Despite thousands of mailed notices and warnings of grave danger, Honda is still having trouble finding and notifying about 300,000 people with potentially deadly air bag inflators in their cars. About 69 million Takata inflators have been recalled due to possible rupture. And in June, government regulators said testing showed that inflators in 313,000 older Hondas and Acuras had as high as a 50 per cent chance of rupturing in a crash. They told owners to stop driving them and get repairs. But four months later, only 13,000 of the cars have done so, highlighting major holes remain in the recall system. ___ New Wells Fargo CEO to employees: ‘We’re sorry’ NEW YORK (AP) — Newly appointed Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan has told employees that he is “sorry for the pain” that the bank’s employees have felt as a result of the company’s sales practices scandal. Sloan’s company-wide speech given Tuesday is the latest effort by Wells Fargo’s executives to atone for the fact that the bank’s employees, pushed by impossible sales goals, opened as many as 2 million bank and credit card accounts without customers’ authorization. In the speech, Sloan acknowledged that the bank did not respond to the problems in its branches soon enough and that upper management dodged responsibility for the bad behaviour and wrongly placed blamed on its branch employees. ___ Consumer stocks fall as Whirlpool, GM and others skid NEW YORK (AP) — Shaky results from consumer companies dragged the U.S. stock market lower on Tuesday as well-known names like appliance maker Whirlpool and athletic apparel maker Under Armour suffered their worst losses in years. Third-quarter earnings continued to dominate the market and some of the biggest companies either reported disappointing results or lowered their expectations. Investors wondered if consumers will spend less money on home improvement, clothing and other goods. But companies including Procter & Gamble and Lockheed Martin soared after their reports. Looking for safer options, some investors bought bonds and utility company shares. ___ US home prices rose in August, lifted by dwindling supply WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. home prices climbed at a solid pace in August as more home buyers competed for fewer available properties. The Standard & Poor’s CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose 5.1 per cent in August, after a 5 per cent gain in July. Portland, Seattle and Denver reported the strongest year-over-year increases for the seventh month in a row. Steady hiring, low mortgage rates and some early signs of rising pay have encouraged more Americans to buy homes. Yet the number of homes for sale has fallen nearly 7 per cent from a year ago. ___ Consumer confidence retreated slightly in October WASHINGTON (AP) — American consumers felt less confident this month, but the small retreat came after confidence had risen to a 20-month high in September. Consumer confidence slipped to 98.6 this month after rising to 103.5 in September, the Conference Board reported Tuesday. The September reading was the highest since confidence stood at 103.8 in January 2015. The September confidence number was revised down from an initial estimate of 104.1, which had been the highest in nine years. The lower October reading reflected a drop in consumers’ assessment of current business conditions and employment prospects. ___ Caterpillar stung by global economic funk PEORIA, Ill. (AP) — Caterpillar’s third-quarter profit was essentially cut in half with the global economy stuck in a funk, and the company said that it expects that malaise to extend into next year. The construction and mining equipment maker lowered its outlook for the year. Falling commodity prices on the farm, in the mines, and in the oil patch have forced a deep reduction in equipment spending. The earnings report Tuesday was the first since Caterpillar announced that longtime CEO Doug Oberhelman was stepping down. ___ Merck breezes past 3Q profit expectations, raises forecast Higher sales of vaccines and prescription medicines, coupled with restrained spending, helped Merck & Co. post a 20 per cent jump in third-quarter profit, trouncing Wall Street expectations. The company raised and narrowed its 2016 financial forecasts, but noted some headwinds, including the start of U.S. generic competition to three drugs by year’s end. ___ Procter & Gamble’s 1Q performance tops Street’s view CINCINNATI (AP) — Procter & Gamble Co.’s fiscal first-quarter results beat Wall Street’s expectations as it controlled expenses and saw solid sales growth in its health care segment. P&G has been working on transforming its business to better focus on bigger brands with growth potential. The company has already shed some of the smaller brands it says collectively contribute little to its operating profit. ___ Under Armour takes a breather BALTIMORE (AP) — Under Armour had one of the worst trading days in its history as investors sensed that the hard-charging athletic company may be hitting the wall. The company reported Tuesday that quarterly revenue growth was the slowest in six years and it trimmed growth projections. Chief Financial Officer Chip Molloy said that while Under Armour continues to believe that it will significantly outpace rivals, “the growth rate going forward will be less than” what was anticipated last year. ___ GM reports record 3Q earnings despite slowing US sales DETROIT (AP) — General Motors doesn’t seem too worried about slowing U.S. auto sales or economic troubles in Europe. If third-quarter numbers are any indication, the company has numbers to back that up. The Detroit automaker reported a record profit on Tuesday that doubled results in the third quarter a year ago. And the automaker put a little more swagger behind its full-year guidance, predicting pretax earnings at the high end of previous forecasts of $5.50 to $6 per share. GM earned $2.77 billion, or $1.76 per share, compared with $1.36 billion, or 84 cents per share a year ago. Revenue hit a record $42.8 billion. ___ Chipotles sales fall again as it tries to win back customers NEW YORK (AP) — Chipotle says its sales fell for the fifth straight quarter, as the company struggles to win back customers after an E. coli scare last year. The burrito chain says sales fell 21.9 per cent at established restaurants during the quarter ending Sept. 30. That’s worse than the 18.3 per cent drop Wall Street analysts expected, according to FactSet. The company has given out millions of free burritos and launched a three-month loyalty program in June to try to bring customers back. In September, it offered even more freebies: Kids could eat free on Sundays and students could grab free sodas or iced tea with their meals. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average sank 53.76 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 18,169.27. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index gave up 8.17 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 2,143.16. The Nasdaq composite slid 26.43 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 5,283.40. Benchmark U.S. crude lost 56 cents, or 1.1 per cent, to $49.96 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 67 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $50.79 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline stayed at $1.50 a gallon. Heating oil lost 2 cent to $1.56 a gallon. Natural gas sank 6 cent, or 2 per cent, to $2.77 per 1,000 cubic feet. shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Leave a comment Cancel reply Sign in to comment.

Oct 25, 2016, 3:47 pm EST  |  By , ETFChannel.com     A study of analyst recommendations at the major brokerages shows that Procter & Gamble Co (PG) is the #11 broker pick, on average, out of the 30 stocks making up the Dow Jones Industrial Average, according to ETF Channel. Procter & Gamble also comes in above the median of analyst picks among the broader S&P 500 Index components, claiming the #212 spot out of 500. In forming this rank, the analyst opinions from the major brokerage houses were tallied, and averaged; then, the underlying components were ranked according to those averages. Investors often interpret analyst opinions from different angles — a popular analyst pick could mean that many sharp minds individually came to the same bullish conclusion, and therefore the stock should do well, but it could also mean that if the company stumbles, that would come as a negative surprise.

"We will absolutely accept the results of the election," Trump's vice presidential candidate, Mike Pence said on the Sunday shows. Trump's remarks reflect his frustration with "the obvious bias in the national media" reporting in the last month of the election allegations that Trump sexually assaulted several women. Trump says all of the allegations are "lies." "When he talks about a rigged election, he's not talking about the fact that it's going to be rigged at the polls," former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani said. "What he's talking about is that 80 percent to 85 percent of the media is against him." In fact, Trump did warn, without evidence, about vote fraud in a tweet sent after his surrogates tried to reframe his remarks. "The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD," Trump tweeted later Sunday. Much of the cleanup duty falls to Pence, the Indiana governor trying to support the mercurial Trump without damaging his own future presidential prospects. On Sunday, that meant putting distance between himself and Trump over the very legitimacy of the Nov. 8 election after Trump on Saturday revived the claim that the FBI should have brought charges against Hillary Clinton over her use of a homebrew email server. "Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted and should be in jail. Instead she is running for president in what looks like a rigged election," Trump tweeted to his 12 million followers on Saturday. Answered Pence Sunday: "We'll accept the will of the American people. You bet." Threatening to jail a political opponent and fueling public distrust of a popular election — to explain his loss, should that happen — was a striking breach of faith in American democracy. He has repeatedly claimed, without offering evidence, that election fraud is a serious problem and encouraged his mostly white supporters to "go and watch" polling places in certain areas to make sure things are "on the up and up." Trump is struggling to shift the focus away from mounting accusations that he sexually assaulted women in ways similar to behavior he is recorded describing on a recently released video. That puts Pence in the position of putting air between himself and the man at the top of the ticket. Trump, for example, has fought back against the allegations of sexual abuse by saying some of the accusers aren't attractive enough for him to assault, and by calling all of the charges "lies." But Pence on Sunday declined to make any such attacks. "I wouldn't say anything to disparage any woman who believes they've had an experience like this," he said on NBC, adding that he believes Trump's denials. On another subject, Pence was asked if he agrees with Trump's statement Saturday that Clinton was on drugs during the second debate and calling for drug testing before Wednesday's third and final showdown. "All I know for sure is that Donald Trump is going to be ready for the debate on Wednesday night," Pence replied. And unlike Trump, Pence acknowledged Sunday that evidence points to Russia being behind the hacking of Democratic emails. "I think there's more and more evidence that implicates Russia and there should be serious consequences," he said. Pence appeared on NBC's "Meet the Press" and "Fox News Sunday." Giuliani was on CNN's "State of the Union." ___ Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report. ←Older Newer→ Updated : 2016-11-16 08:43 GMT+08:00 MOST POPULAR Taiwan’s Eva Air among world’s top 10 best airlines for 2017 Taiwan has highest success rate of test tube babies in world Philippines travel site shows you 8 places in Taiwan that can heal heartbreak Pigsty Uncle forces pigs to walk the plank Authorities say launch of Uber EATS in Taipei illegal China bullies Taiwan: Trump adviser Missed the supermoon?

Third-quarter earnings continued to dominate the market and some of the biggest companies either reported disappointing results or lowered their expectations. Investors wondered if consumers will spend less money on home improvement, clothing and other goods. But companies including Procter & Gamble and Lockheed Martin soared after their reports. Looking for safer options, some investors bought bonds and utility company shares. Consumer spending is critical to the U.S. economy and poor results for consumer-focused companies could be a sign of trouble. But Doug Roman, managing director of equities for PNC Capital Advisors, said it's too soon to know if shoppers are closing their wallets. "The market might be extrapolating bigger stories into broader themes, which might not be the case," he said. Corporate earnings have been falling for more than a year, and despite Tuesday's results, investors are growing hopeful that streak is ending. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.17 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,143.16.

Weaker oil prices also cast a pall. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 wavered into a modest gain by midday, adding 0.1 percent to 17,379.25, but most other regional benchmarks fell. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.7 percent to 23,403.44 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 dropped 1.5 percent to 5,359.40. South Korea's Kospi lost 1.5 percent to 2,007.38 and India's Sensex lost 0.7 percent to 27,895.12. Markets in Southeast Asia and Taiwan also fell. WALL STREET BLUES: Disappointing third-quarter earnings from big name companies raised worries over consumer spending, a critical driver of U.S. growth. Sherwin-Williams had its worst day in seven years, losing 10.9 percent, while Whirlpool plunged 10.8 percent. Athletic wear maker Under Armour's shares sank 13.2 percent, its biggest drop in almost eight years. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3 percent to 18,169.27, the Standard & Poor's 500 index gave up 0.4 percent to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq composite shed 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40.

Stocks opened slightly lower on Wall Street, Tuesday, Oct. 25, 2016, as some companies issue disappointing earnings and forecasts. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) ANALYST VIEWPOINT: "U.S. equities turned lower overnight as the U.S. Consumer Confidence Index printed well below market expectations," Illka Gobius of OANDA said in a commentary. "We could see further pressure on equity markets because oil prices plunged in late N.Y. trade" after the American Petroleum Institute reported a much larger than expected buildup in U.S. crude inventories. APPLE EARNINGS: After U.S. markets closed, Apple reported lower quarterly sales, another dispiriting factor given the many Asian manufacturers that are suppliers for the iPhone and other Apple products. "Apple's numbers after-market look quite uninspiring and we are seeing shares down 2.5 percent in after-hours trade," Chris Weston of IG said in a research note. OIL PRICES: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 65 cents to $49.31 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It lost 56 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $49.96 per barrel on Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, dropped 58 cents to $50.21 a barrel. It fell 67 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $50.79 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 104.35 yen from 104.12 yen. The euro rose to $1.0890 from $1.0879. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed to this report.

Shares of the maker of Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper gained more than 4 percent in afternoon trading Tuesday. P&G has been working on transforming its business to better focus on bigger brands with growth potential. The company has already shed some of the smaller brands it says collectively contribute little to its operating profit. Chairman, President and CEO David Taylor said in a written statement Tuesday that the company is “now focusing all our efforts on 10 large, structurally attractive categories where P&G holds leading positions.” Advertisement Continue reading P&G, the world’s largest consumer products maker, earned $2.71 billion, or 96 cents per share, for the period ended Sept. 30. A year ago the Cincinnati-based company earned $2.6 billion, or 91 cents per share. Earnings, adjusted to account for discontinued operations and restructuring costs, were $1.03 per share. That topped the 98 cents per share that analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research expected. Revenue was basically flat at $16.52 billion. Analysts polled by Zacks expected revenue of $16.45 billion. Sales for the health care unit climbed 4 percent, while sales for the fabric and home care division edged up 1 percent. For fiscal 2017, P&G still expects adjusted earnings per share growth of mid-single digits compared with fiscal 2016’s earnings of $3.67 per share. Analysts polled by FactSet predict earnings of $3.88 per share. Its shares rose $3.48, or 4.1 percent, to $87.58 in afternoon trading Tuesday. Its shares are up 13 percent over the past year. ____ Elements of this story were generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.

P&G's shares were up 4.6 percent at $87.97 on Tuesday morning. The company has been selling off unprofitable brands and focusing on core brands such as Tide, Pampers and Gillette to revive sluggish sales. P&G sold 41 of its brands, including Clairol and Wella, to Coty Inc in a $12.5 billion deal earlier this month. P&G is also planning to save as much as $10 billion in costs over the next five years, after cutting the same amount in costs over the last five years. The company plans to reinvest a significant portion of savings from the new plan in product and packaging improvement, research and development, and expanding sales coverage, P&G's Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on a media call. Organic sales in P&G's fabric and home care business - its largest - rose 4 percent in the first quarter, while those in baby, feminine and family care, the second largest, rose 2 percent. The two businesses, which house brands such as Tide, Febreze, Pampers and Tampex, together accounted for 60 percent of the company's total revenue. P&G's revenue was driven by "solid" volume growth of 3 percent in the quarter, in contrast to rivals such as Unilever , whose sales were mainly propped up by price hikes, Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy wrote in a note. Net sales remained largely flat at $16.52 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30, but beat the average estimate of $16.49 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales in the United Kingdom, P&G's largest European market, fell 2 percent in the quarter, Moeller said. Britain's vote to leave the European Union has caused a plunge in the pound, leading consumer goods makers such as Unilever to attempt to raise prices in the market. Moeller declined to discuss P&G's pricing strategy, but said the UK continued to be a "very challenging and highly promotional" market. P&G said net income attributable to the company rose 4.3 percent to $2.71 billion, or 96 cents per share. Excluding items, P&G earned $1.03 per share from continuing operations, beating the average analyst estimate of 98 cents. P&G's quarterly sales have been mostly falling for more than three years, as the company has been cutting its brand portfolio.

Asit Sharma (TMFfinosus) Oct 24, 2016 at 12:35PM In this episode of Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, Vincent Shen and senior Fool.com contributor Asit Sharma look at the wide world of SKUs, or stock keeping units. Companies across various industries must strike the right balance between product breadth and operational complexity to succeed, and SKU rationalization (or reduction) lies at the heart of that challenge. The latest initiatives at Unilever (NYSE:UL) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) exemplify the efforts companies are taking in this space. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 12, 2016. Vincent Shen: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It is Wednesday, Oct. 12th, and I am your host, Vincent Shen. Just so you know we are pre-recording this episode and teeing it up to air on Tuesday, the 18th. I am connected with Fool.com senior [contributor] Asit Sharma via Skype. How are you, Asit? Asit Sharma: I'm doing very well, Vince. Thank you for asking. Doing great this morning! Shen: Yeah, I had Dan on yesterday. He was in South Florida. I know you're in Raleigh, North Carolina, we were able to speak before the show, and I was glad to hear that everything was OK after the hurricane. But two guests on, or two [contributors] on, and both of you guys did see at least a little bit of impact from the storm. Sharma: Yeah, we were a little surprised here in Raleigh because most of the models forecast that the storm would hit more fiercely where Dan was. So I thought maybe Dan would be wet, I would be dry. It did come in inland a little bit. I happened to be traveling actually, so missed that, but the good news is the storm is over and we're cleaning up. So we'll move on. Shen: Yup. So I was really excited to have you on the show today, so we can kind of really pick up from our last discussion and continue breaking down some of the supertrends that we are seeing in the consumer and retail sectors. Last week we talked about mass customization, the growing importance of basically personalizing products and services to appeal to consumers and to build brand loyalty. So we looked at custom sneakers, right? From NIKEiD, how Starbucks can brew the exact coffee you want with their very expensive Clover brewing system, and then there's Etsy, with the huge marketplace it has built for handmade crafted goods. So our next supertrend has companies turning their attention, I think, a bit more into their internal operations. That's with SKU rationalization or specifically for our discussion, SKU reduction. So we'll look at this through the lens of two leading consumer products companies: Unilever and Procter & Gamble. But before we get any further than that I mentioned SKU rationalization and I think some of our listeners could probably use just a quick update or refresher on exactly what we're talking about there. Sharma: Absolutely. What is an SKU? It's shorthand for "stock keeping unit" and Wikipedia has a great definition. I'm going to read this for our listeners. It's a "distinct type of item for sale." So manufacturers identify their products by unique codes that they've built. Those may actually be different than the barcodes that you see in, let's say, a grocery store when you're picking up a package to scan and pay for, but each product a manufacturer builds has this code and every time they vary the product whether it's size, color, anything, that creates a new stock keeping unit, or SKU. Shen: So, I think that with the SKUs and it kind of comes into conflict a little bit. On the one hand, we're going to talk about in this discussion how companies are working to basically make their operations more efficient, more profitable, and in some cases they are able to even boost their sales by reducing some of the offerings that they give to consumers. But in the last episode, we talked about on the customization side, giving more optionality, more potential to personalize and customize a product for each consumer, but I guess my question is can you give us an idea of how things flow through a company? We can use maybe one of the two companies, Unilever, or Procter & Gamble as an example, but how this decision in terms of what products are offered, the number of SKUs in a company's portfolio kind of flow through and can impact some of the metrics that investors are focused on generally. Sharma: It's a good question. Companies play a guessing game when they create products for a particular brand portfolio. And that guessing game is: What will the consumer want? What's the consumer's tolerance for product variation? And there are three major factors that drive the expansion of a product portfolio. First is to keep those product lines fresh and relevant. Most of us have seen the phrase "new and improved," and I guess listeners are are familiar with the concept that this is all in a marketing ploy, but companies also create more products to suit the changing whims of the customer. I have these whims, and you have these whims, we may not know it, a lot of times these are internalized and it's based on what we imbibe from our culture, popular culture. Just also what's practical in our lives. Could be a very small variation on, let's say a handle of a grocery jug. We've seen milk cartons change over time. So, these whims drive product innovation as well. The third thing is product innovation. Now, when I think of product innovation, I think of a brand-new product. Because, well, innovate; you must be creating something new. But corporations look at slight variations in product packaging or say they change a formulation, add a flavor to a juice. If you are a beverage manufacturer that is a third reason. And innovation to a manufacturer can be very slight tweak. So these three factors drive that expansion of a portfolio and what we see is that in the consumer marketplace, companies will first expand their portfolios and then start to draw them back because it's an art, it's not a science. If a company had a handle on exactly how many variations of a product per each geographical region was necessary, then they would find this miraculous optimization of profit. And that's just not something that comes easily. Shen: Yeah, I think it's important to point out that with every item that a company offers essentially, that has costs and investments associated with it. Think the storage of your completed product and the materials needed to create it, packaging, your supplier relationships, the marketing of your offerings, and also disposal in some cases for some products or SKUs that have gone obsolete. So every dollar a company spends toward one SKU that would have been better spent on another, will potentially result in a reduction in the top or bottom line. Or both. So, I think for publicly traded companies, it's fair to say that investors and shareholders place a high value on also the predictability and accurate guidance from management. I think you had mentioned earlier a little bit about forecasts; if you have an overabundance of offerings and SKUs, I think it becomes increasingly difficult to essentially forecast out your expected sales and that can reduce profitability if discounting, for example, is needed to reduce stock or you have to send additional stocks to suppliers because items sold out unexpectedly. And let's jump directly into one of our two companies. Let's start with Unilever. No. 3 consumer goods product company by revenue behind Procter & Gamble, and Nestle. Can you tell us a little bit about their efforts and how they've approached SKU rationalization? Sharma: Sure. So, our supertrend for today is this idea of shrinking SKUs or SKU rationalization and why it's a supertrend and why Unilever is such a great example. We, in our last episode, separated the idea of just a trend from the idea of supertrend by saying if many corporations are out there jumping on this trend and they're both big and small, that is a great indication we're seeing a supertrend. Unilever fits right in because they're one of the biggest, baddest consumer goods companies on the planet. They have hundreds of brands and literally thousands and thousands of SKUs and they practice what Vince has mentioned a couple times: SKU rationalization. Let's quickly define that term if you're not familiar with it. It's a really simple concept. SKU rationalization is when you use data and analytics to pare down those underperforming SKUs and then you transfer your resources into the SKUs which are getting market share. So we're going to use this term a lot and it's a great way to sound really smart if you're talking to other investors; you can talk about SKU rationalization and your favorite companies. Unilever's multiyear goal is to reduce their SKU by 20%. When you visualize a company which is in hundreds of countries around the globe dealing with local markets, you can imagine the complexity of their operation. So for a company like this to decide to reduce SKUs ... Well, let me stop here. Last week we talked about Nike, which I also call Nike, SKUs are often pronounced as "skews," so if you hear me start saying "skews," same thing. But this multiyear goal sprung from management's realization that if we undertake this investment, we may reduce revenue somewhat but we're going to have more profitable products. I'd like to talk about one case study. This is something that happened several years ago when Unilever's U.K. and Irish units combined into one group. When they got together, this was around 2008 to 2009, and they performed an analysis of their SKUs and they found that 60% of product variance contributed just 5% of their sales, but that made up 20% of inventory. And Vince, I know you had also seen that case study. What are your thoughts about that? That really opened my eyes to why a company should jump in and perform SKU rationalization. Shen: Yeah, those numbers -- notably the 5% of sales and the 20% of inventory -- is unbelievable. This case that you mentioned, I think it was from 2008 to 2009, but even as recently as 2014 Unilever still had about 50,000 SKUs in its portfolio. So it's a monumental task. You know, keeping track of that, managing that, and the fact that, as we'll get into more detail, about how the company and specifically the U.K. and Irish units kind of approached this issue. Really, the results you'll see have had a very direct impact on their financial performance. Sharma: Sure. One of the ways that Unilever and other companies benefit once they trim those SKUs is that their manufacturing setups become more profitable. So again, some learning today -- companies have what are called manufacturing lines. That is, when you go into a plant you can imagine that not every product has its own manufacturing line, else we would have factories taking up most of the square footage on Earth. But similar products lines and manufacturing setup is a process of preparing several products to run through lines either individually or ganged up together. So if you can take, to use an example, package of cereal and reduce the sizes of those boxes or the numbers of sizes that you offer, that is, then you can make that one manufacturing setup, which is there to produce those boxes, more profitable. And those of you who are familiar with manufacturing will understand that the company itself may have part of the manufacturing process, but every multinational conglomerate has to work with a series of smaller suppliers and they have their own manufacturing setups to produce one product. So, you can see this trimming of SKUs reducing the complexity of the operation and this is a big thing that industry people talk about. It's not just shrinking or reduction, it's the reduction of complexity and Unilever is really bent on doing that. Shen: Yeah, I think ... Let me just jump in there really quick. The thing that really surprised me is when they talk about this project, the fact that the amount of work that they had to do with their partners. It wasn't just this internal process that the right managers in departments could implement unilaterally. They had to work with their marketing teams that had previously invested resources and time into certain projects, excuse me, and products and SKUs. And then also their retailers, for example, you know the companies that they distribute their products to are concerned about making sure their shelf space is the way they want it to be. And that the products that Unilever is providing them -- you know a huge supplier, I'm sure, for a lot of these retailers -- that basically they can still optimize their shelf space, what they keep in stock, in their stores based on these changes. And some of them very radical that Unilever was making. Sharma: That's an excellent point. We're going to talk about our second company, Procter & Gamble, in a moment, but P&G's CEO recently made that point on an analyst call and he said that when they talk with their retail partners, that's one of the major things that CEOs of their retail partners are telling them is, "Hey, reduce this complexity." And you know, we're in a political season. Elections are coming up next month and one of the things we can extrapolate from what you just said, Vince, is that this can be a really political process. You can imagine if a marketing team has worked two years on an innovation and another management part of the company looks at this product that marketing team has pushed forth and realizes that logistically it's very hard to produce, and you have teams tussling over whether a product stays or goes. And the companies which are successful at SKU rationalization understand that they, at the end of the line, are responsible to shareholders, to earnings per share. So they have to make some tough decisions, and this often means reducing suppliers. I'm going to give you another eye-opening statistic. We talked about Unilever reducing SKU count by as much as 20% as a multiyear goal. The company also wants to reduce the number of its suppliers by 35%. And these two goals are related; it may be a little scary to have a revenue concentration with a huge corporation like Unilever or a smaller sub-manufacturer and understand they are looking, not just to trim the SKUs, but to trim the number of people they work with. But again, this serves shareholders' interests, it reduces complexity, and reducing complexity reduces costs, which boosts net income at the end of the day. Shen: Yup. So in our last few minutes here, I wanted to make sure we got to Procter & Gamble because they have been taking, I think, this whole process and reducing and optimizing their offerings to a whole other level with the amount of brands they have dropped recently and how they're trying to refocus their resources, their money, into basically what they see as the most profitable brand portfolio that they can possibly target. Sharma: Absolutely. If you take the concept of SKU rationalization and blow it up, there's a term for it. It's called brand rationalization. And that's what Procter & Gamble is up to. They also have been talking up their effort to reduce SKU count over the past several years. But a couple of years ago they woke up one day and realized: We have way too many brands in our portfolio. So, over the last 18 months, Procter & Gamble has exited, or consolidated, 61 of their brands and it's in the process of exiting 44 more by the end of this year. Again, going back to what we found in Unilever's case study, the brands that Procter & Gamble is getting rid of represented only 6% of profit during those 18 months. And when this whole process is completed, Procter & Gamble is going to be left with only 65 brands across 10 major categories. Shen: So let me hop in there really quick. One thing I wanted to make sure we touched on for listeners was also just previously, over the summer, we'd done a show that's somewhat related to this, was around inventory turnover, inventory management, and there's a point here, a metric here, for Procter & Gamble that really stands out to kind of show how this brand rationalization that you mentioned has benefited them. So let's touch on that, and then also I'd love if there are any other metrics. I know there's nothing that is one-to-one necessarily with SKU management and with reduction that investors can look at, but what other metrics can investors use when trying to evaluate a company's effort in this space? Sharma: Sure. Well, you've touched on a really great one. This is a metric that you can find on many financial websites, but if you look at days of inventory outstanding. When you hear that a big company is trying to become more efficient with its product lines, there's a way you can see if they're being effective or not. Procter & Gamble before this effort, the other day, had a days inventory outstanding of 78 days. What that means is that it takes Procter & Gamble about 78 days to cycle its inventory on average and it replaces its inventory about 78 days, if you average everything out. Through this process, P&G now has a days inventory outstanding of 58 days, and that's a very solid boost to cash flow because inventory is cash tied up. You have to build a product, you have to move it, you have to store it, to get into a store, and then you get paid and collect the cash. So, this is an excellent metric to see if a company is walking the walk. And we can tell in this case that P&G is certainly walking the walk. Some other metrics you can look at include the cash conversion cycle which again, is maybe effective to look at but might be more difficult to find. But if you want one which is easy enough to locate, look at a company's operating cash flow. Procter & Gamble again is sacrificing some top-line sales in order to trim its brands. That means some brands will disappear, it won't be selling those on the marketplace. But if you look every quarter going forward at the amount of operating cash flow Procter & Gamble generates, if it's being successful, that number is going to grow every quarter here on out. I love to look at that when I know companies are trying to become more efficient with their resources. And these two concepts are tied together. The company cycles its inventory more quickly, it should produce more operating cash flow. And so far what we're seeing is it's a good thing that Procter & Gamble has undertaken this initiative so long-suffering investors have seen that stock for many years just remain stagnant. It's finally, I think, getting a little bit of lift from these operational efforts. Shen: Yeah, absolutely. We are about to wrap up here, so thank you Asit for your thoughts. But I really wanted to hammer the point home in terms of how important these efforts can be for companies by stepping back a little bit and giving a little bit of a big-picture context and calling out some numbers that I think can put things into perspective. For example, in 2008 research from the Food Marketing Institute had the typical U.S. grocery store, or supermarket, stocking about 47,000 different products. That is up 50% from the previous decade and about five-fold since 1975. Keep in mind that a Wal-Mart Supercenter, for example, their SKU numbers for a store that size is well over 100,000. And then if you go a step further, researching the case at any one time in the United States, there are at least one million products on the market for consumers to purchase. So that research might be a few years old now, so with some of the other trends that we've seen you can imagine that number is likely much larger than one million at this point with customization, for example. So the sobering reality I think for a lot of retailers, be it Unilever or Procter & Gamble, is that consumers only use about 340 unique items in a year out of that one million-plus. And making sure that you are maximizing your profitability, maximizing your product mix and what is on store shelves, to boost your revenue and make sure that that small subset of items that each consumer uses includes products from your portfolio, is just really important. Is there any other thoughts that you wanted to leave our listeners with, Asit? Sharma: Just one last thought. And by the way, those are some mind-boggling statistics and I think that really visually gives us an idea of how much supply there is out there of product and why it's a great idea to reduce as much as you can if you're a manufacturer. My last point is that we see the Pareto Principle in life a lot, which is, 80% of outputs are due to 20% of inputs. See that in so many different spheres of life and manufacturers have found this to be very true ... SKU and brand rationalization, that a lot of times it's just a few products that are really driving your sales and your profits, so why wouldn't you put in the effort to pare those down and optimize your profit and optimize your cash flow? As investors, we should be looking for the companies which are actively trying to perform this exercise. And the two companies we've mentioned today are really into this. Their management talks about these concepts almost every conference call, we see it in the numbers, and it's a great way to evaluate a consumer goods company. Are they paying attention to the proliferation of products that they've got, and are they trying to make themselves more efficient as time goes on? Shen: All right. Thank you very much, Asit!

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Oct 25, 2016 at 5:37PM Image source: Getty Images. Stocks ticked down on Tuesday as investors digested a flood of third-quarter earnings reports. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) indexes ended the trading session lower by roughly 0.3%. Today's stock market: Index Percentage Change Point Change Dow (0.29%) (53.76) S&P 500 (0.38%) (8.17) Data source: Yahoo! Finance. The Direxion Daily Gold Miners 3X Bull ETF (NYSEMKT:NUGT) enjoyed a 9% jump as its highly leveraged bet on the precious metal benefited from an uptick in gold prices. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEMKT:GDX) also enjoyed a solid uptick, rising 3% to bring its year-to-date return over 90%. Earnings reports continued to drive unusually large share price swings, including in Under Armour (NYSE:UA)(NYSE:UA-C) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) on Tuesday. Under Armour lowers its profit outlook Under Armour shareholders endured a 13% daily loss following the athletic apparel specialist's quarterly earnings report. Sales spiked by a healthy 22% to $1.45 billion to edge past consensus estimates that were calling for a 21% jump to $1.45 billion. Earnings also beat expectations, rising 28% to $128 million, which translated to $0.29 per share. The 33 Wall Street analysts who cover the stock were, on average, looking for $0.25 per share of profit.  Image source: Getty Images. Under Armour continues to reap huge rewards from its growing global branding. The international segment enjoyed 74% higher sales with help from significant marketing spending around the Rio Olympic Games. Footwear also expanded at a much faster pace than the rest of the company, soaring 42% to pass $250 million of sales. "Our key strategies and investments to diversify our portfolio on a global scale were evident across categories, channels, and geographies," CEO Kevin Plank said in a press release. However, those investments are costly. Under Armour's gross margin fell by more than a percentage point to 47.5% of sales as it increased promotions. Moreover, Plank and his team see profitability continuing to shrink. In an update to their long-term guidance, the management team lowered its operating profit forecast through 2018, which likely explains the stock's drop on Tuesday. The company left its aggressive sales forecast in place, though, so its market-beating growth potential is still in place, even if shareholders will have to wait longer for the profit payoff. Procter & Gamble's solid sales growth Procter & Gamble's stock jumped 3% after the consumer goods titan announced its best growth pace in years. Organic sales rose by 3%, compared to 2% in the prior quarter, which got P&G off to a strong start in its new fiscal year.  Image source: P&G. Notably, P&G's gains were driven by higher sales volume and not just increased prices. The company has now posted two straight quarters of volume-powered growth to add weight to management's aim to boost overall sales by 2% this year, compared to 1% in fiscal 2016. At the same time, cost cuts produced plenty of excess cash that P&G could direct toward increasing its marketing investments while still boosting profits. The company's core earnings rose by 12%, compared to an 8% decline last quarter. "We delivered broad-based organic sales growth improvement across product categories and markets, as well as strong cost savings," CEO David Taylor said in a press release. The strong results weren't good enough to convince management to boost its outlook. P&G still sees a tough global selling environment keeping growth to a minimum this year. However, with its new, more profitable portfolio finally in place, and with sales volumes picking up, it is likely the maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors will soon reverse the market share declines that have eaten into earnings over the last two years.

Primer: First District Court of Appeals Judge: Stautberg vs. Zayas-Davis Mary Schrott, Enquirer contributor 1:52 p.m. EDT October 27, 2016 Peter Stautberg (Photo: Provided) Attorney Marilyn Zayas-Davis, who has an immigration law-centered private practice in downtown Cincinnati, is challenging Peter Stautberg for one of the six judge slots on the Hamilton County First District Court of Appeals. Stautberg, the incumbent, was appointed to the job by Gov. John Kasich in March, 2015. He’s a former state representative and vice president of Fifth Third Bank. He touted his seven months of experience and 36 opinions on the bench. “I want [voters] to know that I am forthright, hard working, and always out to do the best job that I can do in being fair and rendering justice,” Stautberg said in an interview. Zayas-Davis is making her first bid for a judgeship after a nearly 20-year career in private practice arguing cases in county, state and federal courts. Earlier, she was an assistant prosecutor and worked at Procter & Gamble. She also has a colorful campaign theme: purple. “Purple is the color of inclusion and professionalism,” Zayas-Davis said, passing boxes in her downtown office of campaign T-shirts, posters, flyers, stickers and yard signs all popping with the purple slogan “Marilyn Zayas-Davis For Judge.” In 2001, right after she started her law practice MZD Law in Cincinnati, she won the case State of Ohio v. Yanez . She represented Antonio Yanez, who appealed a guilty plea to two counts of aggravated vehicular assault because the court, before accepting his plea, failed to explain the risk of deportation and being blocked from naturalization if he was convicted. Zayas-Davis won the case in the First District Court of Appeals, the court she now wants to join. “I want everyone that comes to the Court of Appeals to have a meaningful opportunity to be heard,” says Zayas-Davis, who is fluent in Spanish. In 2013, Zayas-Davis won the Distinguished Hispanic Ohioan Award from the Ohio Commission of Hispanic and Latino Affairs. If elected, she would be the only Democrat on the six-judge panel. The First District Court of Appeals is one of 12 of Ohio’s appellate districts. It reviews appeals from lower courts such as Municipal and Common Pleas. The term for this judge slot ends in February 2019. Peter Stautberg Stautberg is a lifelong Cincinnatian. “When I was in law school and as a young lawyer, you're looking at opportunities to give back to the community, and being a judge was always out there as being something to look for,” he recalls in an interview. He also has served the public as a state legislator for the 34th and 27th districts. Stautberg chaired the house’s Public Utilities Committee, and was a member of the Judiciary and Finance & Appropriations committees. He sponsored 19 bills and co-sponsored 127 bills during his tenure. One of the bills he sponsored in 2014, Senate Bill 310, enacted a two-year freeze on Ohio’s renewable energy and energy efficiency standards, causing public outrage. Citizens argued the bill put clean energy jobs at risk. The Ohio Chamber of Commerce and the utility First Energy and American Legislative Exchange Council had pushed to roll back the standards. The bill was signed privately by Gov. Kasich, who issued no statement afterward. Stautberg says his love for the Queen City, as well as his six years representing Ohio’s 27th House District, creates a strong tie with voters. “My heart has always been here. Voters know where I come from, they know who I am and many people even know my family,” he explains. During his campaigning, Stautberg hopes to educate people about what he does as a judge as well as what the appeals court is. “The law is about learning, the law is about informing and it's all about helping people,” Stautberg explains. “I like that ability to council.” Marilyn Zayas-Davis  (Photo: Provided) Marilyn Zayas-Davis A New York native, Zayas-Davis came to Cincinnati to work for Procter & Gamble. In 1994, she enrolled full time in the University of Cincinnati College of Law. Part of Zayas-Davis’ passion for education and serving her community comes from her upbringing in Washington Heights, a drug-torn neighborhood in New York City. While her Puerto Rican immigrant parents worked hard to provide for her family, she says she truly felt at home after moving to Cincinnati. “Cincinnati is my beloved adopted home,” Zayas-Davis explains. “Cincinnatians are good people who care very deeply about family values and community.” The ability to share ideas among the six judges on the Court of Appeals bench has an important appeal for Zayas-Davis. “It’s about a meaningful exchange of ideas and perspectives,” she elaborates on the judging process. “When justice is properly served, it’s a very powerful thing. Justice isn't about winning or losing – it’s about being understood and being heard.” Regardless, all judges run as non-partisans, which Zayas-Davis believes is wonderful because “It’s really about the person not the party.” As judge, Zayas-Davis states she “will be an appellate judge that applies the law consistently, without bias, even candidly.” While Zayas-Davis and Stautberg are competitors, they both agree on the importance of voters focusing on the down ballot. “It’s really is our local races that affect our lives more directly and more often than what happens in Washington,” Zayas-Davis explains. Adds Stautberg, “The further down you go the more local and impactful those candidate are. It’s really important that you understand it does matter, every vote for every candidate.” Mary Schrott is part of a Miami University partnership helping The Enquirer cover the election.

Weaker oil prices also cast a pall. KEEPING SCORE: Japan’s Nikkei 225 wavered into a modest gain by midday, adding 0.1 percent to 17,379.25, but most other regional benchmarks fell. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 0.7 percent to 23,403.44 and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 dropped 1.5 percent to 5,359.40. South Korea’s Kospi lost 1.5 percent to 2,007.38 and India’s Sensex lost 0.7 percent to 27,895.12. Markets in Southeast Asia and Taiwan also fell. WALL STREET BLUES: Disappointing third-quarter earnings from big name companies raised worries over consumer spending, a critical driver of U.S. growth. Sherwin-Williams had its worst day in seven years, losing 10.9 percent, while Whirlpool plunged 10.8 percent. Athletic wear maker Under Armour’s shares sank 13.2 percent, its biggest drop in almost eight years. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3 percent to 18,169.27, the Standard & Poor’s 500 index gave up 0.4 percent to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq composite shed 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: “U.S. equities turned lower overnight as the U.S. Consumer Confidence Index printed well below market expectations,” Illka Gobius of OANDA said in a commentary. “We could see further pressure on equity markets because oil prices plunged in late N.Y. trade” after the American Petroleum Institute reported a much larger than expected buildup in U.S. crude inventories. APPLE EARNINGS: After U.S. markets closed, Apple reported lower quarterly sales, another dispiriting factor given the many Asian manufacturers that are suppliers for the iPhone and other Apple products. “Apple’s numbers after-market look quite uninspiring and we are seeing shares down 2.5 percent in after-hours trade,” Chris Weston of IG said in a research note. OIL PRICES: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 65 cents to $49.31 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It lost 56 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $49.96 per barrel on Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, dropped 58 cents to $50.21 a barrel. It fell 67 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $50.79 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 104.35 yen from 104.12 yen. The euro rose to $1.0890 from $1.0879. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed to this report.

Stocks opened slightly lower on Wall Street, Tuesday, Oct. 25, 2016, as some companies issue disappointing earnings and forecasts. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • Shaky results from consumer companies dragged the U.S. stock market lower on Tuesday as shares of well-known names like appliance maker Whirlpool and athletic apparel maker Under Armour suffered their worst declines in years. Third-quarter earnings continued to dominate the market and some of the biggest companies either reported disappointing results or lowered their expectations. Investors wondered if consumers will spend less money on home improvement, clothing and other goods. But companies including Procter & Gamble and Lockheed Martin soared after their reports. Looking for safer options, some investors bought bonds and utility company shares. Consumer spending is critical to the U.S. economy and poor results for consumer-focused companies could be a sign of trouble. But Doug Roman, managing director of equities for PNC Capital Advisors, said it's too soon to know if shoppers are closing their wallets. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "The market might be extrapolating bigger stories into broader themes, which might not be the case," he said. Corporate earnings have been falling for more than a year, and despite Tuesday's results, investors are growing hopeful that streak is ending. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.17 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,143.16. The Nasdaq composite fell 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. Paint and coatings maker Sherwin-Williams posted a disappointing profit and cut its annual guidance because of slower sales growth combined with spending on new stores. Meanwhile appliance maker Whirlpool's results fell far short of analyst projections. Sherwin-Williams had its worst day in seven years as it lost $30.27, or 10.9 percent, to $247.61. Whirlpool, which owns Maytag and KitchenAid, sank $18.37, or 10.8 percent, to $152.09, its largest loss in five years. Home improvement retailers Home Depot and Lowe's and flooring maker Mohawk Industries all slumped. So did automaker General Motors, which reported solid earnings. Under Armour reported its slowest sales growth in six years and said its future sales won't be as strong as it expected a year ago. Its stock tumbled $5.01, or 13.2 percent, to $32.89, its biggest drop in almost eight years. Rival Nike also slipped. Meanwhile a report showed that consumer confidence fell in October as consumers got a bit more pessimistic about business conditions and their employment prospects. The Conference Board had said consumer confidence reached a 20-month high in September. Procter & Gamble, which makes Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, had its best day in more than a year after it reported better results than investors expected. The consumer products giant has been selling some businesses to cut costs, and it posted stronger sales of personal care products like toothbrushes and deodorants. Its stock rose $2.87, or 3.4 percent, to $86.97, Aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin surpassed investor forecasts and raised its projections for the year. Its stock gained $17.10, or 7.4 percent, to $249.26, its biggest leap in seven years. The reports continued to stream in after the market closed. Apple reported lower quarterly sales and sold fewer iPhones, sending its stock down about 2 percent in late trading. The company did give a better-than-expected forecast for the holiday season. Oil and gas drilling services company Baker Hughes disclosed a smaller loss than investors expected. Investors were also pleased that Baker Hughes is preparing to cut more costs. The company said it plans to eliminate $650 million in spending this year, up from the $500 million it had planned to cut. It climbed $2.24, or 4.3 percent, to $54.39. Waters Corp., which makes products used in drug development, announced weak revenue as demand from governments, research institutions and industries fell. The stock slid $19.15, or 12.1 percent, to $138.60. Drugmaker Merck raised its forecasts after it reported a bigger profit on greater sales of vaccines and cancer medicines. The company has also been trying to keep is spending in check. The stock rose $1.20, or 2 percent, to $61.95. 3M, which makes Post-it notes, industrial coatings and ceramics, forecast weaker sales growth and a smaller profit for the year. The stock declined $5.04, or 2.9 percent, to $166.23. Elevator and jet engine manufacturer United Technologies raised its annual forecast after its third-quarter profit surpassed analyst estimates. Its stock gained $1.84, or 1.8 percent, to $101.36. » Next page...

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 54 points, or 0.3%, to close at 18,169. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index fell 0.4% to 2143 and the Nasdaq composite was 0.5% lower to 5283. Quotes in the article Procter & Gamble Co PG ▲ 83.62 +0.62 +0.75% Caterpillar Inc CAT ▲ 94.44 +0.27 +0.29% United Technologies Corp UTX ▼ 107.68 -0.18 -0.17% Merck KGaA MKGAF ▼ 100.10 -2.15 -2.10% Wall Street got a large slate of earnings reports from Dow components, including well-received reports from P&G (PG), which reported organic growth of 3%, as well as United Technologies (UTX), and drug maker Merck (MRK), which topped forecast with the help of strong sales of its cancer drug Keytruda. But the good news was offset by weaker-than-expected results from companies like 3M (MMM) and Caterpillar (CAT), which cut its earnings view for the remainder of 2016, citing sluggish sales of its heavy equipment. P&G shares rose 3.4%. Merck's stock rose 2%. And United Technologies shares jumped 1.9%. Caterpillar fell 1.8% and 3M fell 3%. Shares of Dow component and chemical giant DuPont (DD) fell 0.7% despite topping profit and sales forecast and boosting its full-year 2016 earnings outlook. 3M shares fell 3% and Caterpillar's stock was unchanged. Caterpillar's outgoing CEO Doug Oberhelman, who is retiring later this year, painted a gloomy picture of the global economy, noting that "economic weakness throughout much of the world persists," in a press release containing the company's earnings results. With the presidential election now two weeks away, investors are also bracing for the homestretch of the campaign and gearing up for any potential surprises. Stocks have held up nicely in recent sessions as the third-quarter earnings season has gotten off to a better-than-expected start. Earnings growth for the July-thru-September quarter is above 1% currently, which has raised hopes that the quarterly streak of contracting earnings growth will end at four. In economic news, consumer confidence fell more than expected in October, according to the Conference Board. But data on the U.S. housing market remained solid. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. home price index rose 0.2% in August and another index that tracks purchase prices saw an uptick of 0.7% in August, according to FHFA. iPhone maker Apple reported its quarterly profit results after today's closing bell.

By Marley Jay, Associated Press October 25, 2016 at 10:57 am NEW YORK — U.S. stocks slipped Tuesday as corporate earnings dominated the news and consumer companies like athletic apparel maker Under Armour and appliance maker Whirlpool absorbed their largest losses in years. However strong results for household goods maker Procter & Gamble sent its stock higher. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average shed 47 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,176 as of 12:45 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 8 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,143. The Nasdaq composite fell 28 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,282. BAD FIT: Under Armour reported its slowest sales growth in six years and said its future sales won’t be as strong as it expected a year ago. Its stock tumbled $5.09, or 13.4 percent, to $32.81. Under Armour traded above $50 a share a little more than a year ago. PAINT IT BLACK: Paint and coatings maker Sherwin-Williams posted a profit that was smaller than expected. The company cut its annual guidance because of slower sales growth combined with spending on new stores. Its stock lost $27.88, or 10 percent, to $250. FOCUS: Procter & Gamble, the company that makes Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, reported better results than investors expected. The consumer products giant has been selling some businesses to cut costs, and it posted stronger sales of personal care products like toothbrushes and deodorants. Its stock rose $3.28, or 3.9 percent, to $87.38. ALL WET: Appliance maker Whirlpool’s results fell far short of analyst projections. The maker of Maytag and KitchenAid products sank $19.22, or 11.3 percent, to $151.24. A GUSHER: Oil and gas drilling services company Baker Hughes disclosed a smaller loss than investors expected. Investors were also pleased that Baker Hughes is preparing to cut more costs. The company said it plans to eliminate $650 million in spending this year, up from the $500 million it had planned to cut. It climbed $2.40, or 4.6 percent, to $54.55. SLOWING TO A TRICKLE: Waters Corp., which makes products used in drug development, announced weak revenue as demand from governments, research institutions and industries fell. The stock slid $18.09, or 11.5 percent, to $139.66. AIMING HIGH: Aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin surpassed investor forecasts and raised its projections for the year. Its stock gained $15.03, or 6.5 percent, to $247.19. TAP THE BRAKES: General Motors had a strong quarter but investors sent its stock down $1.34, or 4.1 percent, to $31.64. U.S. auto sales have risen to record highs and recently they’ve showed some signs of slowing down, which has left investors worried about GM’s growth. MERCK MAKES MORE: Drugmaker Merck raised its forecasts after it reported a bigger profit on greater sales of vaccines and cancer medicines. The company has also been trying to keep is spending in check. The stock rose 95 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $61.70. 3M GETS STUCK: 3M, which makes Post-it notes, industrial coatings and ceramics, forecast weaker sales growth and a smaller profit for the year. The stock declined 5.34, or 3.1 percent, to $165.94. GOING UP: Elevator and jet engine manufacturer United Technologies raised its annual forecast after its third-quarter profit surpassed analyst estimates. Its stock gained $2.11, or 2.1 percent, to $101.63. THIS WON’T GET GOOD RATINGS: Media and marketing information company Nielsen reported shaky results and cut its guidance, which sent its stock down $7.88, or 14.3 percent, to $47.05. CONSUMER CONFIDENCE: American consumers felt less confident this month, according to the Conference Board. Consumer confidence was lower than expected. The measurement rose to a 20-month high in September. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 59 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $49.93 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 66 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $50.80 a barrel in London. However energy companies held steady thanks to big gains for Baker Hughes and to oil refiner Valero, which reported strong results and jumped $2.47, or 4.4 percent, to $58.63. BONDS: Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.75 percent from 1.77 percent. CURRENCIES: The dollar slipped to 104.20 yen from 104.24 yen. The euro fell to $1.0885 from $1.0879. OVERSEAS: In Britain the FTSE 100 rose 0.4 percent while France’s CAC 40 lost 0.3 percent and the DAX in Germany was little changed. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.8 percent and South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.5 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong slipped 0.2 percent.   Tags:  Economy Marley Jay, Associated Press blog comments powered by Disqus Sign up for our newsletters!

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 26 October 2016 | MYT 1:18 AM P&G profit beats on cost cuts, demand for home care goods This AFP file photo taken on July 15, 2008, shows P&G's corporate headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio. BENGALURU: Procter & Gamble Co (P&G), the maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by cost-cutting and strong demand for its baby, feminine and home care products. P&G’s shares were up 4.6% at US$87.97 on Tuesday morning. The company has been selling off unprofitable brands and focusing on core brands such as Tide, Pampers and Gillette to revive sluggish sales. P&G sold 41 of its brands, including Clairol and Wella, to Coty Inc in a US$12.5bil deal earlier this month. P&G is also planning to save as much as US$10bil in costs over the next five years, after cutting the same amount in costs over the last five years. The company plans to reinvest a significant portion of savings from the new plan in product and packaging improvement, research and development, and expanding sales coverage, P&G’s chief financial officer Jon Moeller said on a media call. Organic sales in P&G’s fabric and home care business - its largest - rose 4 percent in the first quarter, while those in baby, feminine and family care, the second largest, rose 2%. The two businesses, which house brands such as Tide, Febreze, Pampers and Tampex, together accounted for 60% of the company’s total revenue. P&G’s revenue was driven by “solid” volume growth of 3% in the quarter, in contrast to rivals such as Unilever, whose sales were mainly propped up by price hikes, Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy wrote in a note. Net sales remained largely flat at US$16.52bil in the quarter ended Sept 30, but beat the average estimate of US$16.49bil, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales in the United Kingdom, P&G’s largest European market, fell 2% in the quarter, Moeller said. Britain’s vote to leave the European Union has caused a plunge in the pound, leading consumer goods makers such as Unilever to attempt to raise prices in the market. Moeller declined to discuss P&G’s pricing strategy, but said the UK continued to be a “very challenging and highly promotional” market. P&G said net income attributable to the company rose 4.3% to US$2.71bil, or 96 cents per share. Excluding items, P&G earned US$1.03 per share from continuing operations, beating the average analyst estimate of 98 cents. P&G’s quarterly sales have been mostly falling for more than three years, as the company has been cutting its brand portfolio. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Procter Gamble , Consumer Products Related Stories P&G officially appoints KTC Consolidated as distributor in Sarawak Kim Teck Cheong appointed as Procter & Gamble distributor Berkshire preliminary Q1 operating profit falls US-Asean Business Council takes lead to boost SMEs P&G to regroup products into four sectors You May Be Interested Closure of 106 bank branches due to rationalisation plans, says Deputy Finance Minister Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Best smartphones for the holidays Alibaba's founder to support 'mini Jack Ma' until university graduation Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Italy, Germany play out 0-0 draw, Buffon equals European record Widespread apathy hampers recycling campaign MRT fare starts at RM1 Property Related advertisement Latest News There is no "truly low-cost" airlines in Asia, there is a gap for this Malaysian palm oil price declines for 2nd session in a row Oil rallies on OPEC deal bets; tech, energy boost global stocks Google announces new London office, 3,000 jobs expected Wall Street rises, helped by tech and energy (Update 1) Most Viewed in Business MRT fare starts at RM1 There is no "truly low-cost" airlines in Asia, there is a gap for this Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Billionaire Ananda Krishnan exploring taking Astro private Malaysia Airlines mulls purchase of 25 widebody jets next year EPF, Eco World in JV to develop township, business park in Selangor Oil rallies on OPEC deal bets; tech, energy boost global stocks Google announces new London office, 3,000 jobs expected Malaysian palm oil price declines for 2nd session in a row PDZ stops fund-raising exercise for proposed billion-ringgit LPG project advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Most Popular Procter & Gamble Co. today solved the mystery behind a series of disappointing top-line results from household and personal-care marketers, posting an upside surprise with 3% organic sales growth for last quarter despite retail scanner data that pointed to much flatter growth. Jon Moeller Credit: Procter & Gamble Co. In calls with media and analysts, Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller pegged some of the divergence on P&G growing much faster and gaining share in e-commerce, which accounted for about a percentage point of sales growth in the U.S. and 5 points in China. E-commerce sales aren't tracked by easily available syndicated retail sales data. Mr. Moeller also noted that analyst scanner data still rightly includes such brands as CoverGirl and Clairol spun off to Coty Oct. 1, but which were discontinued operations not counted in P&G's financial results. And P&G gained from shipments to fill the pipeline for a new distributor in Hong Kong – but that only affected numbers by around 0.1 percentage point globally. In a sign that foreign-exchange pressure is abating, P&G's unadjusted sales were at least flat after several quarters of decline, and its reported net earnings grew 5% in absolute terms after an extended period of currency-fueled declines. P&G also continued to boost ad spending faster than sales, as it has in the past year, and continued to cut marketing costs, both by unspecified amounts. And the company continued to invest in sampling too, which got a fairly impassioned defense from Mr. Moeller. Related Stories Unilever Agrees to Buy Seventh Generation, Continuing CPG Shopping Spree P&G's Pritchard: Time to Cut the Crap -- and the Pressure on Agencies P&G Results Disappoint Wall Street He said P&G had cut spending on promotion in the past because it doesn't deliver immediate results. But he said sampling can win consumers long term in categories with high brand loyalty even though short-term results are actually depressed, because people are using their samples rather than buying the product immediately. Sampling, he said, "is the area of spending that should be the last that we cut, because of its importance in building users for potentially a lifetime of consumption." Overall, P&G's top-line beat wasn't that far off a consensus 2.4% prediction from analysts. But it followed top-line reports by rivals in the past week that have been weaker than expected, particularly in volume terms, from rivals that have been consistently beating P&G of late – including Unilever, RB (Reckitt Benckiser) and Kimberly-Clark Corp. The last yesterday reported flat organic sales growth, with Chairman-CEO Tom Falk citing in part aggressive pricing and promotion from P&G, particularly around deep discounts on adult incontinence products and strong execution of in-store promotions around the Summer Olympics. P&G's organic sales and volume both grew 3% last quarter. But that masked more aggressive pricing in developed markets, where sales grew at 2%, only half the 4% increase in volume. P&G's volume actually grew slower in historically faster-growing developing markets, where it was up 2% on 6% higher sales, driven by price hikes to compensate for currencies declining against the dollar. In question and answer, Bernstein Securities analyst Ali Dibadj raised the prospect of a price war, but Mr. Moeller said P&G's policy continues to be avoiding price promotion because it doesn't deliver sustainable long-term results. But he acknowledged that competitive response is among factors that could make P&G's top line growth bumpy through the remainder of the year. "We will take moves, where warranted, to ensure that we're offering a competitive value proposition to consumers," he said. "We've made several of those moves in the last quarter. What moves happen in the future will be largely dependent on where others take us." P&G's 3% fiscal first-quarter sales gain comes against an easy comparison to a 1% decline a year-ago, and P&G didn't adjust its full-year forecast of 2% growth. But the momentum in the U.S. has been particularly pronounced, from a 1% sales increase in P&G's fiscal first half last year and 2% in the second half up to 3% last quarter. Despite every P&G business sector seeing at least 2% organic sales growth – a rarity in recent years – Mr. Moeller said P&G is still growing below the market in such categories as hair and baby care and U.S. grooming. The company has plans to address that, he said, including a restage of Herbal Essences early next year. Mr. Moeller brushed aside the suggestion in another analyst question that P&G may need to make acquisitions akin to what rival Unilever has done in recent months with Dollar Shave Club and Seventh Generation. The Honest Co., selling environmentally friendly products largely direct to consumers, remains up for sale, according to published reports. Mr. Moeller noted P&G has increased its offerings of environmentally sustainable products in recent years, including Tide Coldwater and Tide PurClean. And he said only 0.3% of P&G's sales are direct to consumers for good reason: Consumers prefer buying packaged goods from big retailers for convenience. "How many people do you know," he said, "that want to satisfy their household shopping needs in a month or two by going to 40 different websites with 40 different passwords and 40 different packages that arrive at 40 different times?"

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 25, 2016 11:41am   Comments Share: Related UA 6 Hottest Stocks Among Shorts: IBM, Fitbit, Under Armour And More Recent Bull Run In Foot Locker Leaves Little Room For Upside Following Q3 Report Lululemon: Mixed Bag Heading Into Holiday Season (Seeking Alpha) Despite the fact that Under Armour Inc (NYSE: UA) tumbled more than 14 percent Tuesday, analysts at Buckingham remain optimistic on the company's prospects. BRG's Scott Krasik maintained a Buy rating and $48 price target on Under Armour's stock following the company's Q3 earnings report. Related Link: Why Under Armour Stock Is Tumbling Krasik went on to counter some of the negative data points hurting Under Armour's stock. Specifically, the analyst argued that concerns of elevated inventory are now irrelevant since inventory at the end of Q3 grew at just half the rate of sales. Krasik added that concerns of a notable slowdown in footwear sales growth are overblown since the company did grow its footwear sales at twice the rate of its apparel growth. Meanwhile, all of Under Armour's vital growth channels were strong in the third quarter, including international sales which rose 74 percent and footwear sales rising 42 percent. In addition, Under Armour's 18 percent rise in apparel sales is "solid" given the "tail-end of inventory dislocation at retail." With that said, the analyst suggested Under Armour's story is "cleaner than it has been in almost a year with the long-term growth opportunities intact." Looking forward, Krasik is expecting: 1) gross margins to improve sequentially, 2) international growth to remain elevated and become more profitable, 3) North American distribution will broaden in a productive manner, and 4) management will continue investing in long-term initiatives. Bottom line, the analyst continues to believe Under Armour remains "the best growth story in consumer and would begin or add to positions at current levels."

Stocks opened slightly lower on Wall Street, Tuesday, Oct. 25, 2016, as some companies issue disappointing earnings and forecasts. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........TOKYO — Shares fell broadly in Asia on Wednesday after a gloomy session on Wall Street, where shares of household names like appliance maker Whirlpool and athletic apparel maker Under Armour suffered their worst declines in years. Weaker oil prices also cast a pall. KEEPING SCORE: Japan’s Nikkei 225 wavered into a modest gain by midday, adding 0.1 percent to 17,379.25, but most other regional benchmarks fell. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 0.7 percent to 23,403.44 and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 dropped 1.5 percent to 5,359.40. South Korea’s Kospi lost 1.5 percent to 2,007.38 and India’s Sensex lost 0.7 percent to 27,895.12. Markets in Southeast Asia and Taiwan also fell. WALL STREET BLUES: Disappointing third-quarter earnings from big name companies raised worries over consumer spending, a critical driver of U.S. growth. Sherwin-Williams had its worst day in seven years, losing 10.9 percent, while Whirlpool plunged 10.8 percent. Athletic wear maker Under Armour’s shares sank 13.2 percent, its biggest drop in almost eight years. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3 percent to 18,169.27, the Standard & Poor’s 500 index gave up 0.4 percent to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq composite shed 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: “U.S. equities turned lower overnight as the U.S. Consumer Confidence Index printed well below market expectations,” Illka Gobius of OANDA said in a commentary. “We could see further pressure on equity markets because oil prices plunged in late N.Y. trade” after the American Petroleum Institute reported a much larger than expected buildup in U.S. crude inventories. APPLE EARNINGS: After U.S. markets closed, Apple reported lower quarterly sales, another dispiriting factor given the many Asian manufacturers that are suppliers for the iPhone and other Apple products. “Apple’s numbers after-market look quite uninspiring and we are seeing shares down 2.5 percent in after-hours trade,” Chris Weston of IG said in a research note. OIL PRICES: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 65 cents to $49.31 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It lost 56 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $49.96 per barrel on Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, dropped 58 cents to $50.21 a barrel. It fell 67 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $50.79 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 104.35 yen from 104.12 yen. The euro rose to $1.0890 from $1.0879. Advertisement Continue reading ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed to this report.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) AP Stocks mostly lower as earnings hit consumer companies By MARLEY JAY AP Markets Writer Oct 25, 2016 (…) Mark Lennihan FILE - This Jan. 4, 2010, file photo shows an historic marker on Wall Street in New York. Stocks opened slightly lower on Wall Street, Tuesday, Oct. 25, 2016, as some companies issue disappointing earnings and forecasts. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are mostly lower Tuesday morning as company earnings continue to stream in. Consumer companies are falling as athletic apparel maker Under Armour and appliance maker Whirlpool suffer hefty losses. However strong results for household goods maker Procter & Gamble send its stock higher. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 13 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,236 as of 10:15 a.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 1 point, or 0.1 percent, to 2,150. The Nasdaq composite fell 4 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,305. BAD FIT: Under Armour reported strong third-quarter results, but the company said it expects slower sales growth. Its stock tumbled $5.04, or 13.3 percent, to $32.87 Under Armour traded above $50 a share a little more than a year ago. PAINT IT BLACK: Paint and coatings maker Sherwin-Williams posted a profit that was smaller than expected. The company cut its annual guidance because of slower sales growth combined with spending on new stores. Its stock lost $27.08, or 9.7 percent, to $250.80. FOCUS: Procter & Gamble, the company that makes Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, reported better results than investors expected. The consumer products giant has been selling some businesses to cut costs, and it posted stronger sales of personal care products like toothbrushes and deodorants. Its stock rose $3.63, or 4.3 percent, to $87.73. Procter & Gamble is a Dow component and pulled that index higher. ALL WET: Appliance maker Whirlpool's results fell far short of analyst projections. The maker of Maytag and KitchenAid products gave up $16.63, or 9.8 percent, to $153.83. A GUSHER: Oil and gas drilling services company Baker Hughes disclosed a smaller loss than investors expected. Investors were also pleased that Baker Hughes is preparing to cut more costs. The company said it plans to eliminate $650 million in spending this year, up from the $500 million it had planned to cut. It climbed $3.81, or 7.3 percent, to $55.96. SLOWING TO A TRICKLE: Waters Corp., which makes products used in drug development, announced weak revenue as demand from governments, research institutions and industries fell. The stock slid $14.22, or 9 percent, to $143.53. AIMING HIGH: Aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin surpassed investor forecasts and raised its projections for the year. Its stock gained $11.24, or 4.8 percent, to $243.40. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 10 cents to $50.42 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 16 cents to $51.30 a barrel in London. However energy companies traded higher thanks to Baker Hughes and to oil refiner Valero, which reported strong results and jumped $2.57, or 4.6 percent, to $58.73. BONDS: Bond prices edged higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.76 percent from 1.77 percent. CURRENCIES: The dollar climbed to 104.74 yen from 104.24 yen. The euro fell to $1.0858 from $1.0879. ASIA'S DAY: In Britain the FTSE 100 jumped 1 percent while France's CAC 40 gained 0.1 percent. The DAX in Germany rose 0.3 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.8 percent and South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5 percent. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay Tags Business General News Consumer Product Manufacturing Oil And Gas Industry Aerospace And Defense Industry Financial Performance Corporate News Consumer Products And Services Energy Industry Industrial Products And Services Stock Markets Financial Markets Products And Services Commodity Markets Locations United States North America Popular This Week Lesbian couple gets 'Trump train' note Ask SAM: How does the Electoral College work?

As ações da P&G subiam mais de 4 por cento nesta terça-feira. A empresa tem vendido marcas não rentáveis ​​e focado nas marcas principais, como Tide, Pampers e Gillette, para reavivar vendas fracas. A P&G vendeu 41 das suas marcas, incluindo Clairol e Wella, para a Coty em um negócio 12,5 bilhões de dólares no início deste mês. A P&G também está reduzindo os custos através de um plano multianual para economizar até 10 bilhões de dólares. A companhia, com base em Cincinnati, no Estado norte-americano de Ohio, informou que o lucro líquido atribuível à empresa subiu para 2,71 bilhões de dólares, ou 0,96 dólar por ação, no primeiro trimestre encerrado em 30 de setembro, ante 2,6 bilhões de dólares, ou 0,91 dólar por ação, um ano antes. Excluindo itens, a P&G lucrou 1,03 dólar por ação nas operações continuadas, superando ligeiramente a estimativa média de analistas de 0,98 dólar, segundo a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. A receita líquida permaneceu praticamente estável em 16,52 bilhões de dólares, mas acima da estimativa média de 16,49 bilhões de dólares dos analistas.

Nov 2016, 01:43 MEZ - Deutsche Märkte öffnen in 7 Stunden 17 Minuten Stocks close lower after mixed earnings results; consumer stocks fall 1%Von Fred Imbert | CNBC – Di., 25. Okt 2016 22:31 MESZ Freigeben 0 Twittern 0 Share0 Drucken Firmen: Dow Jones Industrial Average The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. AKTUELLER KURS Symbol Kurs Veränderung ^DJI 18.923,06 +54,37 GS 211,19 +2,01 U.S. stocks closed lower on Tuesday as one of the busiest days of the earnings season got under way, while oil prices slipped. "Some of the earnings that have come out have been disappointing and you have oil [lower]," said Craig Sterling, head of U.S. equity research at Pioneer Investments. "The market is kind of aimless here today." The Dow Jones industrial average closed about 50 points lower, with 3M contributing the most losses to the tune of nearly 33 points, offsetting a gain of approximately 20 points from Procter & Gamble (PG). The S&P 500 dropped around 0.4 percent, with consumer discretionary falling 1.2 percent to lead decliners. The Nasdaq composite underperformed, falling about half a percent. Earlier, the three major indexes traded slightly higher. "I think oil prices combined with the dollar" are pressuring stocks, said Kim Forrest, senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital. "Our companies don't like that." The U.S. dollar (STOXX:.DXY) traded flat to lower against a basket of currencies, near 98.69, after breaking above 99 for the first time since February, according to FactSet. The euro (Exchange:EUR=) traded near $1.089, while the yen (Exchange:JPY=) traded around 104.2. "The US dollar certainly has had a nice bid over the past three weeks as its clear the Fed is trying to getting away with another hike by yr end but as it will come in the context of a 1.5% US growth story," Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, said in a note. "I argue that the FX discussion will shift from an interest rate differential one to where the growth is. Thus, I think the US dollar is just moving to the upper end of its multi year range rather than being on the cusp of a breakout," he said. More than 90 companies were scheduled to post quarterly results on Tuesday. Dow components 3M (MMM), Caterpillar (CAT) and DuPont (DD) reported earnings before the bell. Caterpillar and 3M posted mixed results, as both beat estimates on the bottom line, while missing on revenues. Caterpillar also lowered its 2016 earnings per share guidance. "On balance, earnings have been better, but we've also had an upward trend in energy prices; that's flattened out a bit," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. "You need something to offset Under Armour being down." Under Armour (UA) shares fell more than 10 percent despite posting better-than-expected results. U.S. crude (New York Mercantile Exchange: @CL.1) for December delivery fell 56 cents, or 1.11 percent, to settle at $49.96 per barrel ahead of weekly inventory data and as verbal squabbles among between OPEC members created uncertainty about a potential output cut. "The picture is incredibly muddy and this is dragging the price of oil lower. Also if you look at the long term curve supply curve, Mexico and Brazil are both in vigorous war to attract interest from companies to drill in their deep water oil reserve," said Naeem Aslam, chief market strategist at Think Markets. Tech giant Apple (AAPL) is scheduled to report quarterly results Tuesday after the bell. "Earnings have been pretty good. I guess it's a question of waiting for the [Federal Reserve] as we face some technical resistance," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. Fort Pitt Capital's Forrest said the biggest question mark surrounding earnings remains in the consumer discretionary sector. "I think those who are doing well are going to do better, and those not doing well will be doing worse," she said. Stocks have held in a very narrow range recently, as the S&P 500 has around 1 percent over the past three months. "The SPX is making headway toward its 50-day moving average, a breakout above which would likely be seen as a positive technical catalyst that is reflective of improved short-term momentum," said Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG, in a note. "There is room for upside follow-through per our overbought/oversold measures, which showed widespread oversold conditions last week among the constituents of the SPX," she said. S&P 500 3-month chartSource: FactSet The Fed is scheduled to hold its next monetary policy meeting next week, and it's largely expected to keep interest rates unchanged. Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart spoke on Tuesday, but did not comment on monetary policy as the central bank entered its self-imposed quiet period. "The more likely time for the Fed to move would be in December," said Ernie Cecilia, CIO at Bryn Mawr Trust. "As long as the data comes strong." In economic news, consumer confidence hit 98.6, with economists polled by Reuters expecting confidence to hit 101.5. Meanwhile, U.S. home prices rose slightly in August from July, with the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite index gaining 5.1 percent year over year. U.S. Treasurys were mixed, with the two-year note yield near 0.85 percent and the benchmark 10-year yield around 1.76 percent. Overseas, European stocks fell, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index (^STOXX) falling 0.35 percent. In Asia, stocks closed mixed, with the Nikkei 225 gaining 0.76 percent and the Korean Kospi falling 0.52 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average (Dow Jones Global Indexes: .DJI) fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 18,169.27, with Home Depot leading decliners and Procter & Gamble the top advancer. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to end at 2,143.16, with consumer discretionary leading nine sectors lower and utilities and consumer staples the only advancers. The Nasdaq (^IXIC) dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.4. About nine stocks declined for every five advancers at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 530 million and a composite volume of 2.757 billion in afternoon trade. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) (^VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded higher, near 13.5, snapping a five-day losing streak. Gold futures for December delivery (CEC:Commodities Exchange Centre: @GC.1) rose $9.90 to settle at $1,273.60 per ounce.

Shares of the maker of Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper gained more than 4 percent in afternoon trading Tuesday. P&G has been working on transforming its business to better focus on bigger brands with growth potential. The company has already shed some of the smaller brands it says collectively contribute little to its operating profit. FILE - This July 9, 2015, file photo, shows signage outside Procter & Gamble corporate headquarters in downtown Cincinnati. Procter & Gamble Co.'s fiscal first-quarter results beat Wall Street's view as it controlled expenses and saw solid sales growth in its health care segment, the company announced Tuesday, Oct. 25, 2016. (AP Photo/John Minchillo, File) Chairman, President and CEO David Taylor said in a written statement Tuesday that the company is "now focusing all our efforts on 10 large, structurally attractive categories where P&G holds leading positions." P&G, the world's largest consumer products maker, earned $2.71 billion, or 96 cents per share, for the period ended Sept. 30. A year ago the Cincinnati-based company earned $2.6 billion, or 91 cents per share. Earnings, adjusted to account for discontinued operations and restructuring costs, were $1.03 per share. That topped the 98 cents per share that analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research expected. Revenue was basically flat at $16.52 billion. Analysts polled by Zacks expected revenue of $16.45 billion. Sales for the health care unit climbed 4 percent, while sales for the fabric and home care division edged up 1 percent. For fiscal 2017, P&G still expects adjusted earnings per share growth of mid-single digits compared with fiscal 2016's earnings of $3.67 per share. Analysts polled by FactSet predict earnings of $3.88 per share. Its shares rose $3.48, or 4.1 percent, to $87.58 in afternoon trading Tuesday. Its shares are up 13 percent over the past year. ____ Elements of this story were generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.

(PG) on Tuesday reported a 4 percent increase in profit for the first quarter from last year on a slight decline in sales. However, both revenue and core earnings per share for the quarter beat analysts' estimates. In addition, the Cincinnati, Ohio-based maker of Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste and Gillette shaving razors affirmed its financial outlook for fiscal 2017. For the first quarter, net earnings attributable to P&G rose to $2.71 billion or $0.96 per share from $2.60 billion or $0.91 per share in the prior-year period. Core earnings from continuing operations were $1.03 per share, compared to $0.98 per share last year. On a currency-neutral basis, core earnings per share increased 12 percent. On average, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the company to earn $0.98 per share for the quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items. Net sales for the quarter were $16.52 billion, down slightly from $16.53 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts had a consensus revenue estimate of $16.49 billion. Sales for the quarter include a negative three percentage impact from foreign exchange. Organic sales increased 3 percent, driven by a three percent increase in organic shipment volume, and increased in all five business segments. All-in volume increased two percent. Gross margin expanded 30 basis points to 51.0 percent, while operating margin was flat with last year at 22.8 percent. Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, P&G affirmed its outlook for core earnings per share growth of mid-single digits versus fiscal 2016 core earnings per share of $3.67 and also maintained its projection for organic sales growth of about 2 percent. P&G expects the combined headwinds of foreign exchange and minor brand divestitures to reduce sales growth for the year by about one percentage point. As a result, the company continues to estimate all-in sales growth of about one percent for fiscal 2017. Analysts expect the company to report earnings of $3.88 per share for the year on revenues of $66.01 billion. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News The Most Influential Books In Business Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America More Top Stories UPS Strike Could Put Wrench In Holiday Shipping Find McRib With Your Phone Stocks Close Mostly Higher Following Upbeat Retail Sales Data - U.S. Commentary Obama's Job Approval Rating Jumps To Four-Year High Americans Optimistic Trump Will Improve The Economy Tech CEO Threatens To Shoot President-Elect Trump Giuliani Reportedly New Favorite To Be Secretary Of State Major Averages Remain Mixed In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags Nasdaq And S&P 500 Move Higher But Dow Gives Back Ground - U.S. Commentary Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances U.S. Business Inventories Rises Less Than Expected In September AAA: Low Gas Prices Drive Spike In Thanksgiving Travel Putin Calls Trump, Agrees To Work To Mend "extremely Unsatisfactory" Ties <<Previous        57 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus RELATED NEWS Procter & Gamble Files Patent Infringement Lawsuit Against Vi-Jon Procter & Gamble Co.

Posted 25 Oct 2016 19:15 Updated 25 Oct 2016 19:45 Procter & Gamble's Tide is seen in a store in Manhattan, New York, U.S., August 1, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Procter & Gamble Co , the maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by cost-cutting and strong demand for its baby, feminine and home care products. P&G's shares were up 2.2 percent at US$86.00 in premarket trading on Tuesday. The company has been selling off unprofitable brands and focusing on core brands such as Tide, Pampers and Gillette to revive sluggish sales. P&G sold 41 of its brands, including Clairol and Wella, to Coty Inc in a US$12.5 billion deal earlier this month. P&G is also reducing costs through a multi-year plan to save up to US$10 billion. Cincinnati, Ohio-based P&G said net income attributable to the company rose to US$2.71 billion, or 96 cents per share, in the first quarter ended Sept. 30, from US$2.60 billion, or 91 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, P&G earned US$1.03 per share from continuing operations, slightly beating the average analyst estimate of 98 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales remained largely flat at US$16.52 billion, but beat analysts' average estimate of US$16.49 billion. P&G's quarterly sales have been mostly falling for more than three years, as the company has been cutting its brand portfolio.

Kostensenkungen und die Fokussierung auf ertragreiche Marken halfen dem Gewinn unter dem Strich um 4 Prozent auf 2,7 Milliarden US-Dollar nach oben, wie der Hersteller von Pampers, Gillette oder Ariel am Dienstag in Cincinnati mitteilte. Dies war mehr als Analysten erwartet hatte. Der weltweit größte Konsumgüterkonzern hatte große Teile seines Kosmetikgeschäfts, wozu auch der Haarpflegespezialist Wella gehörte, an den Parfümkonzern Coty verkauft. Die letzte Etappe dieser im Vorjahr angekündigten Transaktion sei nun erfolgt, hieß es. Den Erlös aus dem Geschäft will der Konzern im zweiten Quartal verbuchen. Der Umsatz belief sich in dem die Monate Juli bis September umfassenden ersten Quartal wie im Vorjahr auf 16,5 Milliarden Dollar, wobei vor allem Wechselkurseffekte bremsten. Ohne den Einfluss von Währungen und ohne Zu- und Verkäufe legten die Erlöse um 3 Prozent zu. Im Gesamtjahr 2016/2017 will der Konzern aus eigener Kraft um rund 2 Prozent wachsen. Auch der Gewinn soll dank des Coty-Geschäfts kräftig steigen./she/stb Empfehlen Drucken Bookmarken   NEWSLETTER Abonnieren Sie jetzt unseren aktuellen Newsletter WIRTSCHAFTSNACHRICHTEN 23:44 Uhr | 15.11.2016 Morphosys nimmt mit ... 23:34 Uhr | 15.11.2016 GNW Ad Hoc: Ad hoc: MorphoSys ... 23:34 Uhr | 15.11.2016 GNW Ad Hoc: Ad hoc: MorphoSys ... 22:55 Uhr | 15.11.2016 Kreise: Snapchat startet Prozess ... 22:46 Uhr | 15.11.2016 ROUNDUP/Aktien New York Schluss: ...

The Cincinnati-based company reported fiscal Q1 EPS of $1.03, beating analyst expectations of $0.98. Revenue fell 0.1% from last year to $16.52 billion, but still topped Wall Street’s view of $16.48 billion. P&G also noted that organic sales increased in all five business segments, on low-to-mid single digit organic volume growth in all segments. Healthcare products, which include power toothbrushes and cold medicine, led the way with a 7% sales rise. Looking ahead, Procter & Gamble reaffirmed its prior full-year earnings guidance of $3.82 to $3.89 per share for the year (analysts are looking for $3.88). It also expects full-year fiscal 2017 revenues to rise 1% to approximately $65.95 billion, while analysts expect $66 billion in sales for the year. Organic sales are expected to gain 2%, and foreign exchange effects are expected to negatively impact sales growth by one percentage point. The company commented via press release: “Our first quarter results mark a good start to the fiscal year,” said Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer David Taylor. “We delivered broad-based organic sales growth improvement across product categories and markets, as well as strong cost savings.

Organic sales  -- a measure that excludes the effects of currency exchange-rate fluctuations as well as acquisitions and divestitures -- rose in all five of P&G’s product divisions units last quarter, leading to a 3 percent gain companywide. And while total revenue still fell, it was the smallest decrease since 2014. David Taylor Source: Proctor & Gamble Co. The results signal that P&G’s strategy of divesting nonessential brands to focus on its main household and personal-care businesses is starting to pay off. The company completed the sale of more than 40 beauty brands to Coty Inc. this month, a move that Chief Executive Officer David Taylor called “the last major step” in P&G’s transformation of its portfolio.  “Now that that endeavor has wrapped, you’ll see their innovation efforts more focused, with the intent of being more responsive on a timely basis,” said Erin Lash, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. Tuesday’s results show the efforts are gaining traction. Profit was $1.03 a share, excluding some items, in P&G’s fiscal first quarter, which ended Sept. 30. Analysts estimated 98 cents, on average. Revenue slipped less than 0.1 percent to $16.5 billion, Cincinnati-based P&G said in a statement. That roughly matched analysts’ projections. The stock rose as much as 4.7 percent to $88.08 in New York, the biggest intraday increase in a year. P&G already had gained 5.9 percent this year through Monday. Organic sales advanced 3 percent in the grooming business, which includes Gillette shaving products. Sales by that measure climbed 3 percent in the beauty unit, which sells Pantene shampoo and Olay skincare products. The health care division, the maker of Crest toothpaste and Prilosec heartburn medicine, had the biggest organic sales increase at 7 percent. The fabric and home care unit posted a 4 percent organic sales gain, while the baby, feminine and family care business had a 2 percent advance. Volume Gains The companywide organic sales increase of 3 percent topped analysts’ consensus expectation of a 2 percent gain, Mark Astrachan, an analyst at Stifel Financial Corp., said in a note. Sales volumes rose 3 percent, marking the strongest performance since the third quarter of 2014, he said. He recommends buying the shares. P&G maintained its forecasts that organic sales would grow about 2 percent and adjusted earnings would increase at a mid-single-digit percentage rate in its current fiscal year. The company’s shrinking goes beyond divestments. Taylor has embarked on another $10 billion cost-cutting program -- the company’s second in five years -- and says he’ll invest some of the savings in research, development and marketing. Some of its efforts already paying off, Lash said. P&G’s single-load laundry detergents have been a success, as have the expanded sizes of its Pampers Swaddlers brand, which helped it overtake Kimberly-Clark Corp. -- the maker of Huggies -- in U.S. diaper market share. On Monday, Kimberly-Clark reported earnings that trailed analysts’ estimates and cut its annual sales forecast, with CEO Thomas Falk citing “a more challenging economic and competitive environment.” All big consumer-products companies are in a tough spot, with new competitors, stagnant demand in developed markets and slowing growth in developing ones, Lash said. “That is ultimately another reason why continuing to invest behind that product innovation is so crucial,” she said.

P&G's shares were up 3.4 percent at $87.00 in premarket trading on Tuesday. The company has been selling off unprofitable brands and focusing on core brands such as Tide, Pampers and Gillette to revive sluggish sales. P&G sold 41 of its brands, including Clairol and Wella, to Coty in a $12.5 billion deal earlier this month. P&G is also reducing costs through a plan to save as much as $10 billion over the next five years, after reducing the same amount in costs over the last five years. The company plans to reinvest a significant portion of those savings in product and packaging improvement, research and development, and expanding sales coverage, P&G's Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on a media call. Net sales remained largely flat at $16.52 billion in the first quarter ended Sept. 30, but beat the average estimate of $16.49 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales in the United Kingdom, P&G's largest European market, fell 2 percent in the quarter, Moeller said. Britain's vote to leave the European Union has caused a plunge in the pound, leading consumer goods makers such as P&G's rival Unilever to attempt to raise prices in the market. Moeller declined to discuss P&G's pricing strategy, but said the U.K. continued to be a "very challenging and highly promotional" market. P&G said net income attributable to the company rose to $2.71 billion, or 96 cents per share, in the quarter, from $2.60 billion, or 91 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, P&G earned $1.03 per share from continuing operations, beating the average analyst estimate of 98 cents. P&G's quarterly sales have been mostly falling for more than three years, as the company has been cutting its brand portfolio. show chapters <p>P&amp;G CFO: Managing &#039;considerable&#039; improvement</p> <p>Jon Moeller, Procter &amp; Gamble CFO, breaks down the company&#039;s quarterly results which beat on the top and bottom line, and provides his outlook on the future as P&amp;G continues innovating new products.</p> P&G CFO: Managing 'considerable' improvement    Tuesday, 25 Oct 2016 | 7:07 AM ET | 03:39 Procter & Gamble's chief financial officer, Jon Moeller, said Tuesday that although the company may be facing headwinds like slowing market growth, its first-quarter earnings report held up regardless. The CFO said that continuous reductions in costs helped Procter & Gamble's above-average organic sales growth in the first quarter. "We grew organic sales 3 percent, on volume growth of 3 percent. We grew in every segment, in 10 out of our 10 categories, in every region, and in 9 of our 10 top markets," Moeller told CNBC's "Squawk Box." Moeller, who is also a member of CNBC's Global CFO Council, said slow market growth can and will be fought through both innovation and active management. As the industry leader in innovation, Procter & Gamble will continue to drive innovation to promote market growth, he said. Moeller also lauded his team's efforts in what he called "the most significant transformation of this company's portfolio in our history," saying he and his colleagues will remain very involved in its management. "We will look to grow both organically and inorganically when the right opportunities present themselves," Moeller said. — CNBC's Elizabeth Gurdus contributed to this report.

Back to BERNAMA.com  | 16 November 2016 Pahlawan Planet Campaign Yields Results By Suriani Razali KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 25 (Bernama) -- Pahlawan Planet, an innovative home-to-school recycling and advocacy campaign initiated by Treat Every Environment Special (TrEES) and Procter & Gamble Malaysia (P&G), has yielded results. The campaign yielded a combined weight of 134,400 kg of recyclables across Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Putrajaya and Negeri Sembilan, a joint statement said. Thirty-five selected secondary schools out of the initial 53 schools, exceeded the campaign target by reaching out to 22,947 households within two months. The Pahlawan Planet campaign was an integral part of TrEES Young Voices for Conservation 2016, which was approved by the Ministry of Education as a national level co-curriculum programme for secondary schools and supported by the Ministry of Urban Wellbeing, Housing and Local Government. The campaign was designed for secondary school students to educate, cultivate and reinforce a culture of caring for the environment by embracing the 4Rs (Rethink, Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) at home and in school. SAVINGS OF WATER, ENERGY AND OIL The total recyclables collected through the campaign was equivalent to saving 3.24 million litres of water, 569,951 kWH of energy and 205,877 litres of oil. The paper collection of 122,300 kg also saved 2,078 trees that can absorb 13,893 kg of carbon dioxide and produce enough oxygen for 6,235 people each year. "Students who participated have gained skills beyond the classroom and the campaign can be implemented independently by the schools in the future to continue this sustainable lifestyle," said P&G Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei Communications and Government Relations Leader Nadiah Syed Nahar. TrEES Director Leela Panikkar said the 630 student team members from 35 schools motivated 22,947 households to begin reducing and recycling their wastes. "The quality of their work throughout the programme has been outstanding," she added. SMK Agama Putrajaya, which was named the Pahlawan Planet champion walked away with a cash prize of RM3,700. The judges were impressed with the student project team's effort to motivate their community members to recycle and practice the 4Rs as well as their overall commitment to the campaign. TEAMWORK AND POSITIVE ATTITUDE Its principal Othman Hashim attributed its success to teamwork, sound strategies, high proficiencies and positive attitude. "The campaign brought together all the stakeholders including the administrators, teachers, support staff, students and parents." "The students' attitude towards things that are thrown away has also changed; they no longer see waste as something disgusting but as materials that must be recycled, reused, and can even provide opportunities for sources of income. The SMK Agama Putrajaya community is determined to make our success as Pahlawan Planet Champions as the first step towards making our school a 'green school' in the near future," he added. SMK Dengkil took the second spot with RM3,300 while SMK Taman Jasmin 2 was placed third with RM3,000. In addition, three special merit prizes worth RM1,500 each were awarded to SMK King George V, SMK Taman Desa 2 and SMK Cheras Jaya. The total amount paid to the 35 selected schools for the recyclables collected was RM37,497.30. Monies received by the schools will be used to improve their greening efforts and activities within each school. -- BERNAMA Tweet   Tweets by @lifestyle_youth © 2016 BERNAMA. All Rights Reserved.

Blame it on the rising U.S. dollar, or fears of higher rates. But chasing yield is now triggering losses. By Michael Kahn Biography Oct. 24, 2016 4:05 p.m. ET Given the near-zero interest-rate environment of the past eight years, it’s hard to blame investors for seeking yield wherever it might be. That often means putting money in excessively risky assets. But it can also mean buying more-conservative assets with little regard to value. The normally defensive consumer-staples sector is a good example of the latter. Typically, investors flock to these stocks in times of uncertainty, with the...

Hey, there. It looks like you're using an ad blocker. The news and features are funded in part by our advertisers. To support Ad Age and the industry we cover please either: SUBSCRIBE or WHITELIST US DigitalNext It's Time to Fix the Viewability Tower of Babel By Randall Rothenberg. Published on October 24, 2016. Bob Liodice and Marc Pritchard at the ANA Masters of Marketing Conference on Thurdsay. Credit: Clarion Pictures Most Popular At last week's Association of National Advertisers annual Masters of Marketing conference, ANA CEO Bob Liodice ringingly endorsed adoption of the industry's viewable impression standard for digital advertising. His position was backed the same morning by Procter & Gamble CMO Marc Pritchard, who told the 3,000 attendees that unitary standards are needed today if marketing is to remain both efficient and effective as the digital era continues to unfold. It's time for the ad agencies to get with the program. Five years ago our industry accomplished something truly remarkable: the ANA, the American Association of Advertising Agencies (4A's), and IAB came together to fix digital measurement -- the single greatest obstacle to marketer, publisher, and agency growth. Hundreds of interviews and cross-industry task force meetings determined that shifting the currency of digital advertising from the served impression to the viewable impression would benefit everyone by putting digital media on a par with other media where viewability had long been an established baseline. Viewability was to become the currency of the land. Digital media transactions were finally going to be measured based on exposure to individual advertisements, making digital the perfect medium for brand advertisers. But because of agency recalcitrance, it hasn't worked out that way. Credit: iStock/Alex Potemkin Exhaustive interviews we've conducted with IAB publisher members show that a quarter to half of their revenue operations groups' time is spent addressing the basic mechanics of digital advertising's supply chain -- from inventory to reconciliation to invalid traffic (IVT) formulas to everything in-between. The source of this time-suck is agencies' inconsistent practices, not to mention the lack of dedicated expertise in their account teams. Agencies are simply resisting a move toward industry consensus; each agency -- and in some cases different account groups in the same agency -- follows very different practices for transacting when it comes to accounting for viewability or invalid traffic must be taken into account. As a result, every negotiation is an expensive one-off, and time that otherwise could be spent generating world-class user experiences is spent on valueless, tedious squabbling. The problem goes deeper. Even if a publisher accepts numbers from an agency, the method the publisher has to use to project inventory, optimize campaigns, and reconcile billing can differ from campaign to campaign and brand to brand -- even when it's from the exact same buying teams. It's not that there is one bad actor. It's simply that the agencies (and account teams within the agencies) aren't taking the time to consider the time and resource drain caused by their lack of coordination and the lack of common business rules. This inefficiency impinges on better uses of time and money, which would benefit the very brands they serve. To be sure, these business rules do exist. The Media Rating Council (MRC), the decades-old, Congressionally-chartered, independent, cross-industry supervisory body charged by our associations with overseeing the development and implementation of viewability standards, has done a remarkable job writing the rules of the road for modern media measurement. The problem is those rules are being honored by agencies only in the breach. This is unacceptable. It's business malpractice. If publishers, out of sheer neglect, required a business activity that forced brand teams to spend 25% to 50% of their time on valueless mechanics, there would be an uproar -- and outright revolt. Now is the time to take a more aggressive, consistent, and substantive stand on the issue. IAB has been and intends to remain a good partner with the 4As, the ANA, and the MRC in Making Measurement Make Sense. But good partnership demands transparency and honesty. Effective immediately, IAB will be shining a bright light on this issue and calling the industry to the table to collectively solve this problem. We will call out bad practices. We will highlight the contradictory practices in which agencies engage. We will illuminate the costs of unnecessary contract provisions. And we will work hard to gain consensus not just on the idea of viewability, but the practice of viewability. Among other activities, the newly formed Viewability Working Group within the IAB Ad Ops Council will be charged with revising the IAB make-good recommendations for viewability by the end of the year. Expect many more initiatives in this area as we head towards the IAB Ad Operations Summit in New York this November. The stakes are too high for us not to take bold action quickly or fail to monitor industry progress in this endeavor. Viewability is a remarkable achievement, but it only works when all parties define viewability-based transactions in the same way. We need the buy-side to step up and agree that as an industry, we must have a more common way of transacting. Draining half our time and resources on basic account mechanics is intolerable. Everyone needs to be part of this solution.

The 5th anniversary promotion slated to run for two months commenced last Monday and will end on 10th of December. This is the first time the brand will be putting together a promotion since its inception in 2011. In addition to the consumer promotion, Oral-B will visit various communities in Nigeria to provide free dental checks to people through the Oral B Mobile Dental Clinic Programme which currently reaches over 2 million Nigerians annually. Consumers who purchase a pack of Oral-B Pro-Health toothpaste within the period, stands a chance to win instant prizes ranging from airtime, products, and cash prizes from N10, 000 to N300, 000. Speaking during the media launch of the National Consumer Promotion, Tolulope Adedeji, Brand Marketing Director, P&G Nigeria said; “Oral B has reached more than five million households since we launched in Nigeria five years ago. We are celebrating this milestone with a consumer promotion and Mobile Dental Outreach as a mark of appreciation and celebration of our teeming customers.” “The essence of the promotion is to celebrate and reward Oral-B consumers across the country. At Procter and Gamble, it is our purpose to touch and improve the lives of customers with our brands. We will be rewarding as many winners as possible in the weekly and monthly draws as well as the grand draw of the Oral B National Consumer Promotion”, the Brand Marketing Director added. . “Four (4) winners will get N200, 000 and one mixed case of Oral-B each at the end of the first and second months. The grand prize winner will get N300, 000 and 2 mixed cases of Oral-B at the end of the promotion. In addition to the monthly and grand prizes, we will be giving out cash prizes weekly as well as daily airtime to winners.” Tolulope also reaffirmed the brands dedication to improving the oral health of all Nigerians through its Mobile Dental Clinic Programme. “A large number of Nigerians do not go for dental checkups nor use the right toothpaste with the right toothbrush and the Oral-B Mobile Dental Clinic programme will provide the opportunity for our customers to enjoy free dental health checks and oral advisory by our accredited dentists across various communities in the country” Ifeoma Chuks-Adizue, Brand Manager for Oral B, also speaking at the event expressed the commitment of the brand in ensuring that people have a healthy oral experience. She added that the introduction of the product was driven by the need to have a truly, all-round protection health toothpaste in a market surrounded by basic fresh breath products. Explaining how the promo works, Ifeoma said winning is simple. Participants only need to purchase a pack of Oral-B Pro-Health toothpaste and send the codes on the tube along with their names and locations to the short code. Responses will be sent for entry into the draws. She also encouraged consumers to take advantage of the brand’s Facebook fan page for more information about the promo. ← Messi humiliates Guardiola with a hat-trick UBA, MEC, Inc., Unveils Omni-Channel Payment System, EmailMoni → Subscribe to our Newsletter First name Email * Latest News Let’s eliminate Malaria with adequate funding, Dangote tasks FG, industrialists MADUMERE’S RIGHT STEPS OF LEADERSHIP FG to recover N450 billion non-remitted funds from MDAs Fake Rivers Rerun results: Blame politicians not INEC – Group Imo Govt., group Partner on youth and agriculture programme Columns 1.8 million-year old skull proves first human beings on earth were Africans WEST AFRICA SINGLE CURRENCY: THE LESSON TO LEARN FROM EUROPEAN SINGLE CURRENCY 2015: A year of Endless Possibilities 2015 General Elections: Hope Rises on APGA Candidates 2015: Imo and the Need for Change Photo Gallery Abia Governor commiserates with Sen.

To support Ad Age and the industry we cover please either: SUBSCRIBE or WHITELIST US ANA Annual Meeting 2016 Purpose, Death and the Backstreet Boys: Takeaways From the ANA By Ad Age Staff. Published on October 24, 2016. ANA Masters of Marketing: CMO Roundtable: AFE's Stephen Quinn, Starcom's Kathy Ring and Best Buy's Greg Revelle Credit: Clarion Pictures Most Popular The Association of National Advertisers held its annual Masters of Marketing conference in Orlando, Fla. If you weren't able to make it, we've got a few takeaways below, whether it was Marc Pritchard's advice to marketers, Gary Vaynerchuck's shock talk, or some nostalgia from the Backstreet Boys. And be sure to check out our complete coverage, including stories and videos here. Give your agency a break The marketing and ad agency industries haven't exactly been best pals of late. Witness the ANA's ongoing battle with 4As over media rebates and transparency. But marketers speaking at last week's event extended more than a few olive branches to agencies. "The last few years have been admittedly tough on agencies, P&G included. And it's time to turn the page. The negative narrative needs to stop," said Procter & Gamble Co. Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard, who also happens to be the new chairman of the ANA. Diego Scotti, chief marketing officer of Verizon, said: "I hear people blame the agency model, saying it's broken. I think that's frankly a lazy way of thinking about it." Don't be a "fuckface" "If you are running [TV] commercials for a brand that targets consumers 22 and under, you're a fuckface." That was just one of many one-liners Gary Vaynerchuk threw at attendees during one of his harsh-truth speeches. Mr. Vaynerchuk railed about marketers and agencies being wedded to the old ways, stuck in legacy creative habits and measuring things that didn't matter. He repeatedly urged the crowd to look at the history of marketing, particularly the transition from radio to TV and what happened to TV. His final takeaway: "You're going to die," Mr. Vaynerchuk said. "It's an amazing time to be in this industry if you're on the offense, it's the worst time if you're on the defense and 95% of you are on the defense." Don't fall into a "crap trap" Mr. Pritchard was actually not very familiar with Mr. Vaynerchuk before his ANA address. And maybe that's no surprise, because his agency, VaynerMedia, does a whole lot of social-media content for a whole lot of P&G's competitors, including Unilever, L'Oreal and Johnson & Johnson. Mr. Pritchard also isn't a big fan of the word "content," or of pumping out lots of stuff on social media of questionable value, such as a Pepto Bismol video he showed about a boy raised by goats, which didn't make note of the brand involved for more than four minutes. Instead, he'd prefer to see his agencies making fewer, better ads. Improving creativity requires craft that "belongs in the hands of serious professionals," Mr. Pritchard said in his ANA address. "Don't ever accept mediocrity. Don't be seduced into the crap trap of just getting something out. On every part of the canvas, craft matters. Let purpose really power the brand After deciding two years ago to quit selling its $2 billion tobacco category and rebrand, CVS Health saw a 40% lift in its perception as a health leader. Norman de Greve, senior VP, chief marketing officer of the $153.3 billion brand, told the crowd his personal story of how he lost his father to lung cancer and wants to ensure he sticks around to spend time with his own young son Luca. "The important thing is that deeds matter more than creeds, so stand up," said Mr. de Greve to attendees, many of whom ranked the talk as one of the conference's strongest. Let's get "phygital" The ANA got formally introduced to a new buzzword by Alison Lewis, chief marketing officer of Johnson & Johnson's consumer business. It means the convergence of the physical and digital worlds. For J&J, that means merging offline and online retailing and marketing. So, for example, J&J recently launched Aveeno into China via e-commerce first before hitting stores. And Neutrogena successfully mined loyalty-card data from store purchases to serve 88 different digital ads programmatically to 18.1 million households aimed at getting folks who had, for example, bought the brand's cosmetics to also buy its makeup-removing wipes. The campaign generated return of $5.84 in added sales in offline stores for every $1 in ad spending online. It's all part of what the company calls "ambidextrous marketing." Be prepared to hear all this again. Phygital is up to 124,000 Google hits. And it got a second mention from the stage from Ellen Moreau, Sherwin-Williams' senior VP-marketing communications, Americas Group. The paint company has been connecting with customers for years in the digital world with its ColorSnap app. The app lets people find the right paint color for their physical spaces in various digital ways, such as taking photos with their phones or finding images on Pinterest. Consider female voiceovers About 75% of commercial voiceovers are done by men, largely because marketers think they sound more authoritative, said former Walmart CMO and current Alliance for Family Entertainment chair Stephen Quinn at Friday's CMO Roundtable focused on the ANA's #SeeHer gender equality initiative. But research by ad testing firm ABX behind the ANA's Gender Equality Measure shows female voiceovers are actually more effective, which makes sense given that most brands have women as their primary consumer target, Mr. Quinn said. Death to demos? Age-gender demographics remain the way much media, particularly TV, gets bought. But speaking at the same CMO Roundtable, Best Buy CMO Greg Revelle said the retailer has moved completely away from demo targeting. "We're going after people who love technology," he said. "What we've found as we've gone through that is that women love technology as much as men." That's also led Best Buy to change the way it casts ads. Pro wrestling is fake -- but audience engagement is real World Wrestling Entertainment's roots go back 50 years. But at her ANA presentation, WWE Chief Brand Officer Stephanie McMahon reminded attendees that the pro wrestling genre goes back to the days of the Roman Coliseum when "the emperor would decide if a gladiator lived or met his unfortunate alternative. Thank god we've evolved to scripting the outcomes." But while the results might be pre-ordained, the WWE adjusts on the fly based on fan reaction. The engagement has helped WWE reach 700 million social media followers. "Our fans are our secret sauce," Ms. McMahon said. "They are a part of our show. Whether they are chanting, cheering, booing -- they can often even influence what happens during the course of a match. Because if something isn't working, you have to change direction quickly." She added: "Our strategy is that we listen and we respond. … It's like the ultimate grassroots marketing." Do the math "Many of us got into marketing to avoid math class," said Wes Nichols, co-founder of Neustar's MarketShare -- a marketing attribution modeler all about math. And his co-presenter, TD Ameritrade Chief Marketing Officer Denise Karkos, acknowledged she went into marketing at Notre Dame in part because it was the business degree that seemed easiest because all the football players were in the classes. But speaking to a relatively lightly attended Saturday session, they made a strong case for doing the math in marketing. Ms. Karkos noted that she's surrounded herself with strong analytics talent throughout her career, and broke with tradition by showing her TD Ameritrade board detailed return-on-investment data for campaign elements rather than the latest 30-second spot. "Now when I go to the board, they want to know what was the ROI of that digital video I saw?" she said. Ms. Karkos has moved largely -- not entirely -- away from upfront TV commitments and inflexible print schedules in favor of an 80% flexible mix of digital, search and other media to optimize around analytics provided by MarketShare and others. Mr. Nichols said that despite their reputation for number-crunching, packaged-goods marketers are now actually behind other industries, such as entertainment, in analytics savvy. ANA Masters of Marketing: A special performance by the Backstreet Boys, sponsored by iHeartMedia, on Thursday, Oct. 20. Credit: Clarion Pictures Bonus item: Backstreet's back, all right OK, so this one might not be applicable to your marketing strategy. The Backstreet Boys' comeback trail led through Orlando on the way to Las Vegas, and the ANA crowd clearly was enthralled. Attendees crowded the stage and sent so many photos and videos to social media and the folks back home, sometimes ironically, that it temporarily choked even the very high-quality data network of Verizon, whose CMO Diego Scotti had noted his brand's premium positioning earlier in the day. ~ ~ ~ Clarification: An earlier version of this story said that Kimberly-Clark was a client of Vayner Media. It is not.

Third-quarter earnings continued to dominate the market and some of the biggest companies either reported disappointing results or lowered their expectations. Investors wondered if consumers will spend less money on home improvement, clothing and other goods. But companies including Procter & Gamble and Lockheed Martin soared after their reports. Looking for safer options, some investors bought bonds and utility company shares. Consumer spending is critical to the U.S. economy and poor results for consumer-focused companies could be a sign of trouble. But Doug Roman, managing director of equities for PNC Capital Advisors, said it's too soon to know if shoppers are closing their wallets. "The market might be extrapolating bigger stories into broader themes, which might not be the case," he said. Corporate earnings have been falling for more than a year, and despite Tuesday's results, investors are growing hopeful that streak is ending. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.17 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,143.16. The Nasdaq composite fell 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. Paint and coatings maker Sherwin-Williams posted a disappointing profit and cut its annual guidance because of slower sales growth combined with spending on new stores. Meanwhile appliance maker Whirlpool's results fell far short of analyst projections. Sherwin-Williams had its worst day in seven years as it lost $30.27, or 10.9 percent, to $247.61. Whirlpool, which owns Maytag and KitchenAid, sank $18.37, or 10.8 percent, to $152.09, its largest loss in five years. Home improvement retailers Home Depot and Lowe's and flooring maker Mohawk Industries all slumped. So did automaker General Motors, which reported solid earnings. Under Armour reported its slowest sales growth in six years and said its future sales won't be as strong as it expected a year ago. Its stock tumbled $5.01, or 13.2 percent, to $32.89, its biggest drop in almost eight years. Rival Nike also slipped. Procter & Gamble, which makes Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, had its best day in more than a year after it reported better results than investors expected. The consumer products giant has been selling some businesses to cut costs, and it posted stronger sales of personal care products like toothbrushes and deodorants.

(AAPL) iPhone Sales Fall Mixed results on the earnings front kept stocks down Tuesday Oct 25, 2016, 5:38 pm EST  |  By Anthony Mirhaydari, InvestorPlace Market Strategist     U.S. stocks finished lower on Tuesday as third-quarter earnings remain in focus. In the end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2%, the S&P 500 Index lost 0.4%, the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.5% and the Russell 2000 finished 0.8% lower. Treasury bonds were mixed, the dollar was unable to hold early strength, gold gained 0.8% and the price of crude was lower down 1.1% on growing doubts about an OPEC-Russia supply freeze deal. Crude was also hit by a surprise inventory build, with API stockpiles up 4.8 million barrels in the largest increase since April. Defensive utility and consumer staples stocks led the way with gains of 0.5% and 0.3% respectively. Consumer discretionary and materials stocks were the laggards, down 1.2% and 1%, respectively. What Stocks Will Win the 2016 Election? Regional bank KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) surged 6% thanks to a Q3 earnings-per-share beat on solid net interest income and loan growth. Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) gained on a Q3 earnings beat driven by 3% organic sales growth versus the 2.4% expected. On the downside, Under Armour Inc (NYSE:UA) lost 13.2% despite better-than-expected earnings and revenues as gross margins disappointed and management comments that its growth rate going forward will slow. Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) dropped 10.8% on a 5% earning miss on weak sales driven by soft demand. After the close, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) lost 1.7% — in contrast to the torrid rally in the stock over the last three months for a 20% gain — after reporting tepid results. Revenues dropped 9% from last year to $46.9 billion with 45.5 million iPhones sold (down 5% from last year but slightly ahead of expectations). Earnings of $9 billion was a whopping 19% decline from last year. China sales were down 30% from last year. The results will further fuel worries that the smartphone market is now mature and saturated, that the iPhone 7 is getting a lukewarm response, and that the company is facing serious headwinds in China. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Just Failed Its Q4 Earnings Test Going forward, keep eye on crude oil as it looks ready for a fresh bout of weakness here as West Texas Intermediate drops back below the $50-a-barrel threshold and threatens a decline below its 20-day moving average for the first time since late September. The November U.S. Oil Fund LP ETF (NYSEARCA:USO) puts recommended today to Edge Pro subscribers are already up 20%.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 26 October 2016 | MYT 6:42 AM Wall Street slips on earnings; Apple falls late after results The Dow Jones industrial average fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. Futures were also pressured after the bell by a late decline in oil prices after data showed a bigger-than-expected build in U.S. crude inventories. NEW YORK: U.S. stocks slipped from two-week highs on Tuesday as results and forecasts from companies in sectors including housing and consumer products failed to live up to expectations. Apple <AAPL.O>, the largest U.S. company by market capitalization, posted after the bell better-than-expected iPhone sales that however continued a declining trend and shares fell about 2 percent, briefly dragging S&P 500 futures <ESc1> to session lows. During the regular session, Whirlpool <WHR.N>, down 10.8 percent to $152.09, cited soft demand as it posted lower-than-expected earnings and gave an underwhelming forecast. Sherwin Williams' <SHW.N> outlook also disappointed Wall Street and shares fell 10.9 percent to $247.61. Both were an indication to some analysts that the housing sector may be cooling. "Lackluster results from Whirlpool and Sherwin Williams may indicate a slowing in the housing cycle," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. She said those results could be weighing on Home Depot <HD.N>, which was down 3.5 percent at $123.34 as the largest points decliner on the S&P 500. Lowes Cos <LOW.N> fell 3.5 percent to $68.47. Consumer products company Procter & Gamble <PG.N> rose 3.4 percent to $86.97 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, while sportswear maker Under Armour <UA.N> fell 13.2 percent to $32.89 after it reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. “We had a rally (Monday) and haven’t been able to sustain it, due to weaker-than-expected numbers from some names,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, calling the day’s earnings a "mixed bag." Overall, annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 percent, effectively putting an end to an earnings recession, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent.

Futures were also pressured after the bell by a late decline in oil prices after data showed a bigger-than-expected build in U.S. crude inventories. 3M <MMM.N> fell 2.9 percent to $166.23 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. Caterpillar <CAT.N> lost 1.8 percent after a downbeat forecast, while General Motors <GM.N> fell 4.2 percent amid fears regarding future profits. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

"To me, once again, the exceedingly profitable revenue stream is the one to watch, and it is still being relatively ignored, despite its 24 percent growth to $6.3 billion, and despite the naysayers' comments," the "Mad Money" host said. After reviewing the quarter, Cramer gave his usual mantra to own Apple, don't trade it. Apple's stock jumped far in advance of earnings, partially because of Samsung's issue with the Galaxy Note 7 phone that left room for Apple to take share in the industry. While Apple's revenue came in line with estimates and earnings beat analyst expectations with better than expected iPhone sales, it was the third straight quarter with a year-over-year decline in revenue. Last year, comparable sales were $51.5 billion, versus $46.9 billion this quarter. Shares fell more than 2 percent in after-hours trading in response. Apple's stock still juicy? Mark Neuling | CNBC Apple iPhone 7 Outside of Apple and Samsung, Cramer saw many more examples of companies excelling versus the competition because they are doing so well with the hand they have been dealt. Procter and Gamble became a house of brands that at one point seemed stalled to Cramer. Some investors considered the stock nothing more than a bond market equivalent with a 3 percent yield. That all changed on Tuesday when Procter & Gamble blew away the numbers, posting 3 percent organic growth. Cramer considered that impressive considering the size of the company. United Technologies boosted its earnings guidance after reporting a terrific quarter. Yet, in contrast, General Electric brought its forecast down. "I think a case can be made that United Technologies is simply out-executing GE in more than just aerospace," Cramer said. It all came down to execution for Cramer, especially in a busy earnings season that is notorious for turmoil. For those investors who do their own stock picking, Cramer reminded them to remember the effect of strong management, and to avoid battleground stocks, like Under Armour in the sports apparel space. "At least until the smoke clears and the stocks have fallen so far that I will tell you when the time is right to pounce," Cramer said. Correction: This story has been updated to show that Apple reported revenue of $46.9 billion. Questions for Cramer? Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC Want to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

Also hurting sentiment was a report showing US consumer confidence weakened more than expected. And oil fell. "We've had some mixed earnings today and the market right now is digesting earnings and positioning itself ahead of the Fed[eral Reserve] meeting next week," Jeff Zipper, managing director for investments at Private Client Reserve at US Bank in Palm Beach, Florida, told Reuters. In 2.10pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index slid 0.4 percent. In 1.54pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.2 percent. The Dow moved lower as declines in shares of 3M and those of Home Depot, recently down 2.9 percent and 2.8 percent respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Procter & Gamble and those of United Technologies, recently trading 4.1 percent and 2.4 percent higher respectively. 3M lowered its outlook for 2016 sales and earnings. Shares of Caterpillar slid, down 2.2 percent recently, after the world’s No. 1 maker of mining and construction equipment, downgraded its full-year sales and profit outlook because of a “challenged environment.” The company now expects sales of US$39 billion, down from a previous estimate for between US$40 billion and US$40.5 billion, it said in a statement. Caterpillar said its expects 2017 sales and revenues "will not be significantly different than 2016.” “While we are seeing early signals of improvement in some areas, we continue to face a number of challenges,” CEO Doug Oberhelman said in the statement. Shares of Whirlpool sank, down 12.1 percent as of 2.06pm in New York, after the company downgraded its full-year profit outlook. Apple edged higher ahead of the release of its fiscal fourth quarter results after the closing bell. While the iPhone maker is forecast to report lower annual sales, the decline may prove less than some analysts have been expecting in part because of rival Samsung’s recent struggles. Meanwhile, a Conference Board report showed its index of consumer confidence dropped to 98.6 in October from 103.5 in September. To be sure, Procter & Gamble and United Technologies were among companies reporting better-than-expected results. “We’re getting some good earnings, but it’s still been a fairly mixed picture,” Matt Maley, an equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co in New York, told Bloomberg. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the session with a 0.4 percent drop from the previous close amid disappointing results from drugmaker Novartis. Germany’s DAX Index inched 0.04 percent lower, while France’s CAC 40 Index fell 0.3 percent. Bucking the trend, the UK’s FTSE 100 Index rose 0.5 percent.

Apple, the largest U.S. company by market capitalization, posted after the bell better-than-expected iPhone sales that however continued a declining trend and shares fell about 2 percent, briefly dragging S&P 500 futures to session lows. During the regular session, Whirlpool, down 10.8 percent to $152.09, cited soft demand as it posted lower-than-expected earnings and gave an underwhelming forecast. Sherwin Williams' outlook also disappointed Wall Street and shares fell 10.9 percent to $247.61. Both were an indication to some analysts that the housing sector may be cooling. "Lackluster results from Whirlpool and Sherwin Williams may indicate a slowing in the housing cycle," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. She said those results could be weighing on Home Depot , which was down 3.5 percent at $123.34 as the largest points decliner on the S&P 500. Lowes Cos fell 3.5 percent to $68.47. Consumer products company Procter & Gamble rose 3.4 percent to $86.97 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, while sportswear maker Under Armour fell 13.2 percent to $32.89 after it reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. "We had a rally (Monday) and haven't been able to sustain it, due to weaker-than-expected numbers from some names," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, calling the day's earnings a "mixed bag." Overall, annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 percent, effectively putting an end to an earnings recession, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. Futures were also pressured after the bell by a late decline in oil prices after data showed a bigger-than-expected build in U.S. crude inventories. 3M fell 2.9 percent to $166.23 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. Caterpillar lost 1.8 percent after a downbeat forecast, while General Motors fell 4.2 percent amid fears regarding future profits. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and nine new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and 73 new lows. About 6.39 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, in line with the 6.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Selling pressure remained relatively subdued, however, limiting the downside for the markets. The major average ended the day firmly in the red. The Dow fell 8.16 points or 0.4 percent to 2,143.15, the Nasdaq slid 26.43 points or 0.5 percent to 5,283.40 and the S&P 500 dropped 53.76 points or 0.3 percent to 18,169.27. The weakness on Wall Street came as traders reacted to the latest batch of earnings news, with a number of big-name companies releasing their quarterly results. Shares of Sonic (SONC) fell sharply on the day after the fast food chain reported better than expected fiscal fourth quarter earnings but provided disappointing guidance. Sportswear maker Under Amour (UA) also came under pressure after the company said its growth rate going forward will be less than expected. On the other hand, shares of Procter & Gamble (PG) showed a strong move to the upside after the consumer products giant reported fiscal first quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates. 3M (MMM), Caterpillar (CAT), and DuPont (DD) are among the other well known companies that released their quarterly results on the day, while tech giant Apple (AAPL) is due to release its results after the close. In economic news, the Conference Board released a report showing a bigger than expected drop in consumer confidence in the month of October. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index fell to 98.6 in October after climbing to 103.5 in September. Economists had expected the index to drop to 101.0. "Consumers' assessment of current business and employment conditions softened, while optimism regarding the short-term outlook retreated somewhat," said Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at the Conference Board. She added, "Overall, sentiment is that the economy will continue to expand in the near-term, but at a moderate pace." Sector News Housing stocks showed a significant move to the downside on the day, dragging the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index down by 2.3 percent. With the drop, the index fell to its lowest closing level in nearly four months. Masco (MAS) led the housing sector lower, with the cabinetry manufacturer slumping by 9.5 percent after reporting weaker than expected third quarter results. Considerable weakness was also visible among natural gas stocks, as reflected by the 1.9 percent drop by the NYSE Arca Natural Gas Index. Biotechnology, consumer, and oil service stocks also saw notable weakness. Meanwhile, gold stocks moved sharply higher as the day has progressed, driving the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index up by 2.5 percent. The strength among gold stocks came as gold for December delivery climbed $9.90 to $1,273.60 an ounce. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Tuesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index advanced by 0.8 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index edged down by 0.2 percent. The major European markets also ended the day mixed. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index rose by 0.5 percent, the German DAX Index closed just below the unchanged line and the French CAC 40 Index fell by 0.3 percent. In the bond market, treasuries showed a lack of direction over the course of the session before closing roughly flat. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, dipped by less than a basis point to 1.758 percent.

However strong results for household goods maker Procter & Gamble are sending its stock higher. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average shed 52 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,171 as of 3:40 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,143. The Nasdaq composite fell 29 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,280. BAD FIT: Under Armour reported its slowest sales growth in six years and said its future sales won't be as strong as it expected a year ago. Its stock tumbled $5.02, or 13.2 percent, to $32.88 and is headed for its biggest loss since 2009. Under Armour traded above $50 a share a little more than a year ago. PAINT IT BLACK: Paint and coatings maker Sherwin-Williams posted a profit that was smaller than expected. The company cut its annual guidance because of slower sales growth combined with spending on new stores. Its stock lost $30.01, or 10.8 percent, to $247.87, its worst one-day decline in seven years. FOCUS: Procter & Gamble, the company that makes Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, is on track for its best day in a year after it reported better results than investors expected. The consumer products giant has been selling some businesses to cut costs, and it posted stronger sales of personal care products like toothbrushes and deodorants. Its stock rose $3.15, or 3.7 percent, to $87.25. ALL WET: Appliance maker Whirlpool's results fell far short of analyst projections and sent the stock to its largest loss in five years. The maker of Maytag and KitchenAid products sank $19.19, or 11.3 percent, to $151.27. THE QUOTE: Consumer spending is critical to the U.S. economy, so poor results for consumer-focused companies could be a sign of trouble. But Doug Roman, managing director of equities for PNC Capital Advisors, said it's too soon to know if consumers are closing their wallets. "The market might be extrapolating bigger stories into broader themes, which might not be the case," he said. A GUSHER: Oil and gas drilling services company Baker Hughes disclosed a smaller loss than investors expected. Investors were also pleased that Baker Hughes is preparing to cut more costs. The company said it plans to eliminate $650 million in spending this year, up from the $500 million it had planned to cut. It climbed $2.34, or 4.5 percent, to $54.49. SLOWING TO A TRICKLE: Waters Corp., which makes products used in drug development, announced weak revenue as demand from governments, research institutions and industries fell. The stock slid $18.98, or 12 percent, to $138.77. AIMING HIGH: Aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin surpassed investor forecasts and raised its projections for the year. Its stock gained $17.25, or 7.4 percent, to $249.41, its biggest leap in seven years. TAP THE BRAKES: General Motors had a strong quarter but investors sent its stock down $1.40, or 4.2 percent, to $31.58. U.S. auto sales have recently shown signs of slowing from a record high, which has investors worried about GM's growth. MERCK MAKES MORE: Drugmaker Merck raised its forecasts after it reported a bigger profit on greater sales of vaccines and cancer medicines. The company has also been trying to keep is spending in check. The stock rose $1.23, or 2 percent, to $61.98. 3M GETS STUCK: 3M, which makes Post-it notes, industrial coatings and ceramics, forecast weaker sales growth and a smaller profit for the year. The stock declined $5.15, or 3 percent, to $166.12. GOING UP: Elevator and jet engine manufacturer United Technologies raised its annual forecast after its third-quarter profit surpassed analyst estimates. Its stock gained $2.28, or 2.3 percent, to $101.80. THIS WON'T GET GOOD RATINGS: Media and marketing information company Nielsen took its biggest loss ever after it reported shaky results and cut its guidance. Nielsen stock tumbled $8.84, or 16.1 percent, to $46.11. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 56 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $49.96 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 67 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $50.79 a barrel in London. BONDS: Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.75 percent from 1.77 percent. Investors also bought shares of utility companies. OTHER ENERGY TRADING: Wholesale gasoline stayed at $1.50 a gallon. Heating oil lost 2 cent to $1.56 a gallon. Natural gas sank 6 cent, or 2 percent, to $2.77 per 1,000 cubic feet. METALS: The price of gold rose $9.90 to $1,273.60 an ounce.

Posted 26 Oct 2016 04:29 Updated 26 Oct 2016 04:39 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Wall Street stocks dropped modestly on Tuesday (Oct 25) as investors adopted a cautious view after a deluge of earnings results that included both positive and negative surprises. "We're seeing an overall positive tone to earnings but we have seen some ... potential signs of caution, so investors are waiting to gather the complete picture," said David Levy, portfolio manager at Republic Wealth Advisors. Big winners included the defence giant Lockheed Martin, up 7.5 per cent, and consumer products giant Procter & Gamble, which gained 3.4 per cent after reporting strong gains in organic sales. On the flip side, shares of paint company Sherwin-Williams and home-appliance make Whirlpool suffered double-digit percentage declines after disappointing results. That prompted concerns that consumer investment in homes is slowing, pushing shares of Home Depot and Lowe's down more than three per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 53.76 points (0.30 per cent) to 18,169.27. The broad-based S&P 500 shed 8.17 points (0.38 per cent) to 2,143.16, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index lost 26.43 points (0.50 per cent) to 5,283.40. Caterpillar finished down 1.8 following a volatile session after reporting that third-quarter net profits sank nearly 50 per cent year-on-year to US$283 million. The heavy equipment maker said it was encouraged that commodities prices have risen somewhat, but that it had yet to see a pickup in business. General Motors dropped 4.3 per cent after reporting that net profit in the third quarter roughly doubled to a better-than-expected US$2.8 billion due largely to lower costs on recalls compared with the year-ago. The automaker warned that its goal of breaking even in Europe could be stymied by fallout from Britain's vote to pull out of the European Union. Athletic shoe and apparel maker Under Armour slumped 13.1 per cent after it warned that it would miss its 2018 operating profit target due to higher expenses as it expands into new markets. - AFP/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

Apple, the largest U.S. company by market capitalization, was expected to report results after the closing bell. Whirlpool, down 10.8 percent to $152.09, cited soft demand as it posted lower-than-expected earnings and gave an underwhelming forecast. Sherwin Williams' outlook also disappointed Wall Street and shares fell 10.9 percent to $247.61. Both were an indication to some analysts that the housing sector may be cooling. "Lackluster results from Whirlpool and Sherwin Williams may indicate a slowing in the housing cycle," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. She said those results could be weighing on Home Depot , which was down 3.5 percent at $123.34 as the largest points decliner on the S&P 500. Lowes Cos fell 3.5 percent to $68.47. Consumer products company Procter & Gamble rose 3.4 percent to $86.97 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, while sportswear maker Under Armour fell 13.2 percent to $32.89 after it reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. "We had a rally (Monday) and haven't been able to sustain it, due to weaker than expected numbers from some names," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, calling the day's earnings a "mixed bag." Overall, annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 percent, effectively putting an end to an earnings recession, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. 3M fell 2.9 percent to $166.23 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. Caterpillar lost 1.8 percent after a downbeat forecast, while General Motors fell 4.2 percent amid fears regarding future profits. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 9 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and 73 new lows. About 6.29 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

It all looks like an effort to conduct a grand, Harvard Business Review-worthy experiment on Canada. Finance Minister Bill Morneau, right, looks on as Dominic Barton, chairman of the Advisory Council on Economic Growth, responds to questions during a news conference in Ottawa on Oct. 20, 2016.  (Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS)   By Jennifer WellsBusiness Columnist Tues., Oct. 25, 2016 The devil is in the footnotes. How do we know that infrastructure drives economic productivity “year after year to the tune of 20 to 50 cents on every original dollar invested”? See footnote one: McKinsey Global Institute and the International Monetary Fund. How do we know that for every $1 million invested, “approximately 15 jobs are created”? See footnote two: McKinsey Global Institute. Article Continued Below How do we know that “best practices” in infrastructure development can result in savings in the “range of 23 per cent”? See footnote 14: McKinsey Global Institute. At the risk of regurgitating prior columns on the strategic initiative known as the Advisory Council on Economic Growth, let’s allow that dollar-a-year man Dominic Barton has spent years on the hustings selling global audiences on McKinsey data and McKinsey big think. Now we have the McKinsey Plan to open the spigot on international funds seeking a revenue-spinning home via investment in Canadian infrastructure while burnishing our reputation as a place for foreign direct investment like, say, Singapore. (Barton once lauded Singapore as the best for one-stop FDI investment. “Their economic development board is like a Procter & Gamble for capital,” he once said. He was at the time, and remains, a member of the board’s International Advisory Council.) Thus Canada is becoming a Petri dish for a grand experiment, a sort of McKinsey global case study that will surely make its way one day into the Harvard Business Review. As part of the grand experiment Finance Minister Bill Morneau is being asked to green light a Canadian Infrastructure Development Bank (CIDB), which sounds like a moniker sprung from the ’60s. (The word “sprung” may trigger PTSD for some economists who recall the east coast vegetable boondoggle.) So Minister Morneau might think first about carefully naming this “once-in-a-generation” opportunity, as defined by the council’s “Path to Prosperity” outline released last week. (It’s feather light, so let’s not call it a “report.”) As sketched, the “bank” would not only assess revenue-generating infrastructure proposals with project costs in excess of $100 million, but could offer “optional advice” as to the procurement and execution of social fabric projects where there is no revenue potential. This dual-class structure seems out of step with the Trudeau government, which has pledged to prioritize, by example, the infrastructure needs of indigenous communities. The risk here is that the CIDB will emerge as an archaic-sounding institution with a “highly independent board of governors and a CEO with world-class, relevant business experience.” (That an independent board of governors needs to be defined as “highly independent” brings to mind the toady director archetype, still a common creature in the Canadian corporate landscape.) And yet, the bones are there. A “national centre of excellence in infrastructure” with transparent performance measures calls to mind Infrastructure Australia, which regularly releases a countrywide priority list. Its Oct. 7 release, by example, itemizes proposed corridor upgrades, airport links, rail improvements etc. by location, timeline and problem category (urban congestion, national connectivity). Remote infrastructure and opportunity for growth are two defined problem categories. And so we see near-term plans for the delivery of infrastructure and essential services to remote communities, improved agricultural water supply in Tasmania and water supply security in Darwin and relocating a STEM research facility to Hobart. Note: as part of its “listening tour” in advance of drafting its first communiqué, the Advisory Council on Economic Growth held two workshops with First Nations communities. Two. That’s just embarrassing. There’s still time for Finance Minister Morneau to walk back some of the McKinsey think, and define instead a more encompassing, holistic Centre for Canadian Infrastructure Excellence. A centre that will not speak first to corporate interests and return on investment, but equally to the needs of one Canada. In numerous speeches, Dominic Barton has made reference to a comment made to him by the late Jim Flaherty. It goes something like this: “I wish I learnt at the beginning to put a microscope in one eye and a telescope in the other and not get a headache.” I wonder if he has ever shared the same anecdote with Bill Morneau. jenwells@thestar.ca The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

Asian shares hit by gloom on Wall Street, lower oil prices Associated Press | TOKYO (AP) — Shares fell broadly in Asia on Wednesday after a gloomy session on Wall Street, where shares of household names like appliance maker Whirlpool and athletic apparel maker Under Armour suffered their worst declines in years. Weaker oil prices also cast a pall. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 wavered into a modest gain by midday, adding 0.1 percent to 17,379.25, but most other regional benchmarks fell. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.7 percent to 23,403.44 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 dropped 1.5 percent to 5,359.40. South Korea's Kospi lost 1.5 percent to 2,007.38 and India's Sensex lost 0.7 percent to 27,895.12. Markets in Southeast Asia and Taiwan also fell. WALL STREET BLUES: Disappointing third-quarter earnings from big name companies raised worries over consumer spending, a critical driver of U.S. growth. Sherwin-Williams had its worst day in seven years, losing 10.9 percent, while Whirlpool plunged 10.8 percent. Athletic wear maker Under Armour's shares sank 13.2 percent, its biggest drop in almost eight years. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3 percent to 18,169.27, the Standard & Poor's 500 index gave up 0.4 percent to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq composite shed 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: "U.S. equities turned lower overnight as the U.S. Consumer Confidence Index printed well below market expectations," Illka Gobius of OANDA said in a commentary. "We could see further pressure on equity markets because oil prices plunged in late N.Y. trade" after the American Petroleum Institute reported a much larger than expected buildup in U.S. crude inventories. APPLE EARNINGS: After U.S. markets closed, Apple reported lower quarterly sales, another dispiriting factor given the many Asian manufacturers that are suppliers for the iPhone and other Apple products. "Apple's numbers after-market look quite uninspiring and we are seeing shares down 2.5 percent in after-hours trade," Chris Weston of IG said in a research note. OIL PRICES: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 65 cents to $49.31 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It lost 56 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $49.96 per barrel on Tuesday. Brent crude, the international standard, dropped 58 cents to $50.21 a barrel. It fell 67 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $50.79 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 104.35 yen from 104.12 yen. The euro rose to $1.0890 from $1.0879. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed to this report.

Photo / AP Stocks on both sides of the Atlantic slid amid disappointing results from companies including 3M and Caterpillar. Also hurting sentiment was a report showing US consumer confidence weakened more than expected. And oil fell. "We've had some mixed earnings today and the market right now is digesting earnings and positioning itself ahead of the Fed[eral Reserve] meeting next week," Jeff Zipper, managing director for investments at Private Client Reserve at US Bank in Palm Beach, Florida, told Reuters. In 2.10pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index slid 0.4 per cent. In 1.54pm trading, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index declined 0.2 per cent. The Dow moved lower as declines in shares of 3M and those of Home Depot, recently down 2.9 per cent and 2.8 per cent respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Procter & Gamble and those of United Technologies, recently trading 4.1 per cent and 2.4 per cent higher respectively. 3M lowered its outlook for 2016 sales and earnings. Shares of Caterpillar slid, down 2.2 per cent recently, after the world's No. 1 maker of mining and construction equipment, downgraded its full-year sales and profit outlook because of a "challenged environment." The company now expects sales of US$39 billion, down from a previous estimate for between US$40 billion and US$40.5 billion, it said in a statement. Caterpillar said its expects 2017 sales and revenues "will not be significantly different than 2016." "While we are seeing early signals of improvement in some areas, we continue to face a number of challenges," CEO Doug Oberhelman said in the statement. Continued below.

Apple edged higher ahead of the release of its fiscal fourth quarter results after the closing bell. While the iPhone maker is forecast to report lower annual sales, the decline may prove less than some analysts have been expecting in part because of rival Samsung's recent struggles. We've had some mixed earnings today and the market right now is digesting earnings and positioning itself ahead of the Fed[eral Reserve] meeting next week. Meanwhile, a Conference Board report showed its index of consumer confidence dropped to 98.6 in October from 103.5 in September. To be sure, Procter & Gamble and United Technologies were among companies reporting better-than-expected results. "We're getting some good earnings, but it's still been a fairly mixed picture," Matt Maley, an equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co in New York, told Bloomberg. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the session with a 0.4 per cent drop from the previous close amid disappointing results from drugmaker Novartis.

While you were sleeping: UPDATED US stocks fall as earnings disappoint Margreet Dietz Wednesday October 26, 2016 Share Play NBR radio on Stocks on both sides of the Atlantic slid amid disappointing results from companies including 3M and Caterpillar. Also, hurting sentiment was a report showing US consumer confidence weakened more than expected. And oil fell. "We've had some mixed earnings and the market right now is digesting earnings and positioning itself ahead of the Fed[eral Reserve] meeting next week," Florida-based US Bank managing director for investments Jeff Zipper told Reuters. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 53.76 points, or 0.3%, to 18,169.27. The Nasdaq Composite Index slid 0.5% to 5283.40 while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index dropped 0.4% to 2143.16. The Dow moved lower as 3M and Home Depot shares dropped, down 2.9% and 2.8% respectively, outweighed gains Procter & Gamble and United Technologies shares, up 4.1 % and 2.4 % higher respectively. 3M lowered its outlook for 2016 sales and earnings. Caterpillar shares slide Shares of Caterpillar slid, down 2.2% after the world's No. 1 maker of mining and construction equipment, downgraded its full-year sales and profit outlook because of a "challenging environment." The company now expects sales of $US39 billion, down from a previous estimate for between $US40-40.5 billion, it says. Caterpillar expects 2017 sales and revenues "will not be significantly different than 2016. "While we are seeing early signals of improvement in some areas, we continue to face a number of challenges," chief executive Doug Oberhelman says. Shares of Whirlpool sank 11% after the company downgraded its full-year profit outlook. Apple edged higher ahead of the release of its fourth-quarter results after the closing bell. While the iPhone maker is forecast to report lower annual sales, the decline may prove less than some analysts have been expecting in part because of rival Samsung's recent struggles. "We're getting some good earnings, but it's still been a fairly mixed picture," New York-based Miller Tabak & Co equity strategist Matt Maley told Bloomberg. Meanwhile, a Conference Board report shows its index of consumer confidence dropped to 98.6 in October from 103.5 in September. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the session with a 0.4% drop from the previous close amid disappointing results from drugmaker Novartis. Germany's DAX Index inched 0.04% lower, while France's CAC 40 Index fell 0.3%. Bucking the trend, the UK's FTSE 100 Index rose 0.5%. (BusinessDesk)   Got a question about this story?

Also hurting sentiment was a report showing US consumer confidence weakened more than expected. And oil fell. “We’ve had some mixed earnings today and the market right now is digesting earnings and positioning itself ahead of the Fed[eral Reserve] meeting next week,” Jeff Zipper, managing director for investments at Private Client Reserve at US Bank in Palm Beach, Florida, told Reuters. In 2.10pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index slid 0.4 percent. In 1.54pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.2 percent. The Dow moved lower as declines in shares of 3M and those of Home Depot, recently down 2.9 percent and 2.8 percent respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Procter & Gamble and those of United Technologies, recently trading 4.1 percent and 2.4 percent higher respectively. 3M lowered its outlook for 2016 sales and earnings. Shares of Caterpillar slid, down 2.2 percent recently, after the world’s No. 1 maker of mining and construction equipment, downgraded its full-year sales and profit outlook because of a “challenged environment.” The company now expects sales of US$39 billion, down from a previous estimate for between US$40 billion and US$40.5 billion, it said in a statement.

Shares of Whirlpool sank, down 12.1 percent as of 2.06pm in New York, after the company downgraded its full-year profit outlook. Apple edged higher ahead of the release of its fiscal fourth quarter results after the closing bell. While the iPhone maker is forecast to report lower annual sales, the decline may prove less than some analysts have been expecting in part because of rival Samsung’s recent struggles. Meanwhile, a Conference Board report showed its index of consumer confidence dropped to 98.6 in October from 103.5 in September. To be sure, Procter & Gamble and United Technologies were among companies reporting better-than-expected results. “We’re getting some good earnings, but it’s still been a fairly mixed picture,” Matt Maley, an equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co in New York, told Bloomberg. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the session with a 0.4 percent drop from the previous close amid disappointing results from drugmaker Novartis.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermidMore By Hilary Russ NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on disappointing earnings reports on Tuesday, while the U.S. dollar slipped from multi-month highs after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney cast doubt on expectations for more monetary stimulus. Oil prices fell more than 1 percent, with U.S. crude breaking below $50 per barrel for a second straight day, ahead of weekly data that could show a build in inventories. On Wall Street, nine of the eleven sectors in the benchmark S&P 500 stock index closed lower, with housing and consumer products companies among those failing to live up to forecasts on third-quarter earnings. Shares of some big names, including Whirlpool , General Motors Co , Caterpillar Inc and 3M , all lost ground. "We had a rally (Monday) and haven't been able to sustain it, due to weaker-than-expected numbers from some names," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois. He called the day's earnings report a "mixed bag" for stocks. Another third of the S&P 500 is scheduled to report earnings this week, including heavyweights Apple , Alphabet , Amazon and Boeing . The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. The dollar was a hair lower against a basket of major currencies <.DXY> after touching an eight-month high. Growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in December had boosted the dollar to its highest level in more than seven months against the euro and about three months against the yen. When BoE policymakers meet next week to consider whether to cut interest rates, they will "undoubtedly" take sterling's weakness into account, BoE Governor Mark Carney told lawmakers on Tuesday. "Carney's comments cast doubt on easing from Europe," said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. Sterling slumped to its lowest level since the Oct. 7 "flash crash" but recovered some of its losses on Carney's remarks. The pound was last down 0.47 percent. In European stocks, mining companies <.SXPP> rose 3.2 percent, lifted in part by Anglo American , up 4.55 percent after its production update. Anglo is the top-performing stock on Europe's STOXX 600 <.STOXX> this year. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index <.FTSE> extended gains, closing up 0.45 percent. Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> turned slightly lower, ending down 0.04 percent, after hitting its highest level of the year. The closely-watched Ifo survey beat expectations, a day after purchasing manager numbers had done the same. Metal prices surged, with zinc up 2.37 percent at $2,366.85, but off an earlier three-week high of $2,376. It is up nearly 60 percent from January lows on worries about shortages. Other commodity prices slipped, though, as many are priced in U.S. dollars. U.S. crude oil futures settled 56 cents lower at $49.96 per barrel, down 1.11 percent.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 25, 2016 11:52am   Comments Share: It’s an epic earnings day on Wall Street, as a collection of massive U.S. companies report results, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and five other Dow components. Fed speakers and housing data help round out the schedule. Earnings just keep rumbling on here as we near the end of October, and so far, there’s been little not to like. To date, more than 75% of companies have beat expectations, and, in a truly positive sign, nearly 80% have beaten Wall Street’s consensus estimates on the revenue side of the coin. Futures trading pointed toward a slightly higher open. Approximately 180 S&P 500 companies report results this week, and it seems like a big portion of them come today. Among the big names are Merck & Co., Inc (NYSE: MRK), Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE: LLY), 3M Co (NYSE: MMM), and E I Du Pont De Nemours And Co (NYSE: DD). And waiting in the wings is Apple, which reports after the close (see below). Expect the flavor of the market this week to mostly be shaped by individual company earnings stories, and remember, there’s still a lot to come after today, with names like Boeing Co (NYSE: BA), The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO), Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) on tap in the coming days. By the end of the week, investors should have pretty good insight into the health of big U.S. companies. Earlier today, another biggie reported, as Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) surpassed earnings per share estimates but didn’t match Wall Street analysts’ estimates on revenue. The company also lowered its full-year guidance, and, in a statement, cited “economic weakness throughout the world.” But MRK shares zoomed up 3% early Tuesday after the company solidly beat on earnings and revenue. 3M, Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) and DD also beat estimates. Bond prices remain under pressure, in part from solid U.S. economic data, and the yield on U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds is back above 1.75%. It’s also noteworthy that the yield curve is on its way up, meaning the spread between short-term and longer-term yields is increasing. This can be a positive factor for the financial sector, and sure enough, financials are up nearly 2% over the last week, solidly ahead of the broader market. Consumer confidence reached nine-year highs last month, and we’ll find out if that lasted into October when the Conference Board reports at 10 a.m. ET today. Perhaps a better measure of consumer confidence is durable goods data, due Thursday morning. And the Case-Shiller 20-city housing index and the FHFA Housing Index, both out this morning, might also provide more insight into the consumer economy. Atlanta Federal Reserve President Dennis Lockhart speaks this afternoon. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans made some dovish remarks on Monday about potentially keeping the federal funds rate lower for longer. M&A Volume Scampering Up: Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity is picking up here in Q4, with the biggest recent deal the $85 billion agreement for AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) to purchase Time Warner Inc (NYSE: TWX). That was just one of a few recent deals totaling nearly $240 billion that have a chance to make 2016 the second-biggest M&A year on record after 2015 if just a handful of the current deals come to fruition, Bloomberg noted. M&A activity became rather sluggish in the wake of the Great Recession, falling well over 50% on a value basis between 2007 and 2009 before waking up and slowly growing until the record activity of last year. A relatively slow-growing economy that makes it hard for companies to out-perform, combined with low interest rates that provide easy access to financing, often can make M&A seem more attractive. On the other hand, the agreement between T and TWX appears to face a challenging regulatory scrutiny, and politicians from both major parties expressed concern that the deal could concentrate too much power in too few hands. We’ll see what ultimately gets done with this one. Are Samsung’s Struggles Handing AAPL a Bigger Slice of Market? As anyone who’s been on an airplane flight recently probably knows, airlines have banned Samsung’s Galaxy 7 phone because it might be a fire hazard, and the phone has been recalled. Did this steer additional customers to Apple, which reports earnings after the close today? That’s one thing to keep an eye on, and investors might also be curious to see how AAPL’s new iPhone 7 did during its first months on the market. Though the iPhone 7 and Samsung’s struggles could take the headlines, it’s also worth watching to see if AAPL continues to see falling sales overall, as it has the last two quarters. The phone market keeps getting tougher, and in Q2, AAPL’s sales fell 15% from a year earlier, the second quarter in a row of falling sales. For Q3, analysts surveyed by Briefing.com expect earnings per share of $1.65, down from $1.96 a year ago, but the company’s share price remains near its high for the year. Going Opposite Ways? Stocks were tracking crude oil rather closely last week, but the relationship appeared to break down a little on Monday, as the S&P 500 Index (Index: SPX) rose nearly 0.5% while front-month U.S. crude futures fell around the same amount, dipping below $50 a barrel during the session before recovering slightly. Pressure on oil came from the fundamental side, as Iraq said it wouldn’t necessarily abide by an OPEC output freeze. But later in the day, Iran said it would encourage other countries to join. Oil futures have been trading back and forth near the $50 level for several weeks, perhaps a sign of how difficult it is to pierce this mark. Last week saw 11 new oil rigs added to U.S. production, according to the Baker Hughes weekly report, if anyone needed a reminder that higher prices often lead to more U.S. drilling, which can lead to lower prices.   TD Ameritrade and all third parties mentioned are separate and unaffiliated companies, and are not responsible for each other’s policies or services.

Disappointing results from fast-food chains to makers of appliances, sports apparel and home-renovation products sparked a selloff in consumer-discretionary stocks amid speculation the economy’s biggest engine is sputtering. The S&P 500 Index fell 0.4 percent to 2,143.16 at 4 p.m. in New York, slipping from a two-week high and closing near its average price during the past 100 days. Apple Inc. declined in after-hours trading following its earnings report. Sonic Corp. plummeted 17 percent, Under Armour Inc. sank the most in almost eight years and Whirlpool Corp. lost 11 percent, rattling investors who anticipated recent signs of wage inflation would embolden spending by American households. Data Tuesday showed consumer confidence fell more than forecast amid concern about the pace of growth. Ahead of Friday’s third-quarter gross domestic product report, lackluster consumer earnings point to possible weakness in the largest component of the American economy. Apple lost 2.1 percent as of 4:57 p.m., even as it predicted higher-than-expected holiday sales, after its fiscal-fourth quarter sales and earnings were mostly in line with analysts’ estimates. “The consumer confidence number really took me by surprise, but we had that bad retail sales report two months ago and then a decent rebound,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist with Wells Fargo Funds Management LLC, which oversees $242 billion. “Reports on U.S. consumers are following more of a saw-tooth pattern which makes it tough to discern the trend.” Weakness in consumer stocks isn’t new this year. While still the bull market’s leader, the group is the S&P 500’s second-worst performer in 2016 with a gain of just 1.3 percent, on pace for its weakest year since 2008. Similarly, groups of homebuilding and home-improvement stocks are on track for their worst years in a comparable period. “These stocks have really been stalling or showing some underperformance for the last year or so,” said Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at MKM Partners LLC in New York. “I don’t want to buy these names, but to me I’m not viewing it as a reason to sell the broad market.” Consumer-discretionary shares fell 1.2 percent, the worst in six weeks. Mohawk Industries Inc. dropped as the maker of residential flooring reported disappointing earnings. Weak results from paint maker Sherwin-Williams Co. helped drag Home Depot Inc. and Lowe’s Inc. down more than 3.4 percent. 3M Co. fell to a five-month low after trimming the top end of its profit outlook. General Motors Co. saw the steepest slide since August amid concerns industrywide U.S. sales are about to plateau after a record six years of gains. Not all reports were bad, even in the consumer sector. Procter & Gamble Co., which has spent years paring down its sprawling consumer-products empire, climbed the most in 14 months amid signs of renewed sales growth. United Technologies Corp. and Merck & Co. added at least 1.8 percent as results topped estimates. The three had the best gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which slipped 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27. About 6.3 billion shares traded hands on U.S. exchanges, in line with the three-month average. “We’re getting some good earnings, but it’s still been a fairly mixed picture,” said Matt Maley, an equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. LLC in New York. “They’re going to come out a little better than expected, but not great. My concern is that, with the dollar acting the way it is, the expectations for fourth quarter and first half 2017 earnings are going to be a little more subdued than they were just a few months ago.” The S&P 500 has been stuck in a 64-point trading range after reaching a record in August, as investors assess the likely trajectory of interest rates, the strength of corporate profits and economic data. The index hasn’t climbed for three consecutive sessions in more than a month as it struggles for direction. It trades at 18.2 times forecast earnings, the highest since at least 2009, and is 2.2 percent from its all-time high. More than a third of S&P 500 members are scheduled to post earnings this week, including Alphabet Inc., Coca-Cola Co., Amazon.com Inc. and Boeing Co. Analysts now predict year-on-year profit at S&P 500 members will be flat once the third-quarter reporting is finished, better than projections for a 1.5 percent contraction a month ago. Investors are also parsing economic reports and comments by policy makers for hints on the timing of the Federal Reserve’s next interest-rate increase. Along with the measure today on consumer confidence, releases on durable goods orders and gross domestic product are due later this week.  Traders are pricing less than one-in-five odds of a hike at the Fed’s next meeting, which takes place days before the presidential election, and a 73 percent chance of action in December, up 10 percentage points from a week ago. “Third-quarter earnings look like they will be a little better than expected, which is key,” said Patrick Spencer, London-based vice chairman of equities at Robert W. Baird, which manages $151 billion. “We’ve got concerns with regard to higher rates in December. That’s what’s dampening some of the enthusiasm.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: U.S. stocks slipped from two-week highs on Tuesday as results and forecasts from companies in sectors including housing and consumer products failed to live up to expectations. Apple , the largest U.S. company by market capitalization, posted after the bell better-than-expected iPhone sales that however continued a declining trend and shares fell about 2 percent, briefly dragging S&P 500 futures to session lows. During the regular session, Whirlpool , down 10.8 percent to US$152.09, cited soft demand as it posted lower-than-expected earnings and gave an underwhelming forecast. Sherwin Williams' outlook also disappointed Wall Street and shares fell 10.9 percent to US$247.61. Both were an indication to some analysts that the housing sector may be cooling. "Lackluster results from Whirlpool and Sherwin Williams may indicate a slowing in the housing cycle," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. She said those results could be weighing on Home Depot , which was down 3.5 percent at US$123.34 as the largest points decliner on the S&P 500. Lowes Cos fell 3.5 percent to US$68.47. Consumer products company Procter & Gamble rose 3.4 percent to US$86.97 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, while sportswear maker Under Armour fell 13.2 percent to US$32.89 after it reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. “We had a rally (Monday) and haven’t been able to sustain it, due to weaker-than-expected numbers from some names,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, calling the day’s earnings a "mixed bag." Overall, annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 percent, effectively putting an end to an earnings recession, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. Futures were also pressured after the bell by a late decline in oil prices after data showed a bigger-than-expected build in U.S. crude inventories. 3M fell 2.9 percent to US$166.23 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. Caterpillar lost 1.8 percent after a downbeat forecast, while General Motors fell 4.2 percent amid fears regarding future profits. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and nine new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and 73 new lows. About 6.39 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, in line with the 6.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

In recent trading, the major averages have seen some further downside, hitting new lows for the session. The Dow is down 55.30 points or 0.3 percent at 18,167.73, the Nasdaq is down 21.31 points or 0.4 percent at 5,288.52 and the S&P 500 is down 8.14 points or 0.4 percent at 2,143.19. The weakness on Wall Street comes as traders react to the latest batch of earnings news, with a number of big-name companies releasing their quarterly results. Shares of Sonic (SONC) have fallen sharply on the day after the fast food chain reported better than expected fiscal fourth quarter earnings but provided disappointing guidance. Sportswear maker Under Amour (UA) has also come under pressure after the company said its growth rate going forward will be less than expected. On the other hand, shares of Procter & Gamble (PG) have shown a strong move to the upside after the consumer products giant reported fiscal first quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates. 3M (MMM), Caterpillar (CAT), and DuPont (DD) are among the other well known companies that released their quarterly results on the day, while tech giant Apple (AAPL) is due to release its results after the close. In economic news, the Conference Board released a report showing a bigger than expected drop in consumer confidence in the month of October. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index fell to 98.6 in October after climbing to 103.5 in September. Economists had expected the index to drop to 101.0. "Consumers' assessment of current business and employment conditions softened, while optimism regarding the short-term outlook retreated somewhat," said Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at the Conference Board. She added, "Overall, sentiment is that the economy will continue to expand in the near-term, but at a moderate pace." Housing stocks have shown a significant move to the downside on the day, dragging the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index down by 1.9 percent. With the drop, the index has fallen to its lowest levels in nearly four months. Networking stocks have also shown a notable move to the downside, while some strength is visible among gold stocks. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Tuesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index advanced by 0.8 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index edged down by 0.2 percent. The major European markets have also turned mixed on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index has edged down by 0.2 percent, the German DAX Index is up by 0.1 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is up by 0.6 percent. In the bond market, treasuries have moved to the upside as the day has progressed. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is down by 1.4 basis points at 1.749 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com The Most Influential Books In Business Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America More Commentary -Global Taiwan Stock Market May Snap Losing Streak Singapore Bourse Likely To Crack Resistance At 2,800 Points Malaysia Market May Extend Tuesday's Gains South Korea Shares May Find Traction On Wednesday Stocks Close Mostly Higher Following Upbeat Retail Sales Data - U.S. Commentary Major Averages Remain Mixed In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary European Markets Finish Mostly Higher, But Little Changed Overall Nasdaq And S&P 500 Move Higher But Dow Gives Back Ground - U.S. Commentary Stocks May Open Higher On Upbeat Retail Sales Data - U.S. Commentary Wall Street Aims At Higher Opening Sensex Plunges 514 Points On Capital Outflow Worries; Nifty Nears 8,200 European Shares Cling To Gains After Data Deluge FTSE 100 Breaches 6800 As Pound Extends Slide CAC 40 Extends Gains As Oil Rallies DAX Gives Up Early Gains <<Previous        50 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Home Depot Lifts FY EPS View In Line With Market As Q3 Results Top Estimates Vodafone Slips To Pre-Tax Loss On Hefty India Charge; Narrows FY View Merck KgaA Lifts FY16 Earnings View As Q3 Results Climb, Stock Up Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone Amaya Gets Huge Buyout Bid From Former CEO Zuckerberg: Facebook Hoax News Did Not Get Trump Elected Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Siemens To Buy Mentor Graphics For $4.5 Bln Enterprise Value Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy ADAP Surges As FDA Lifts Clinical Hold, OCUL Catches Eyes, RegeneRx On The Rise AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet Forget Canada: The Best Places To Escape Trump's America ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD Pfizer : IBRANCE Approved In Europe To Treat HR+/HER2- Metastatic Breast Cancer Engie 9-month EBITDA Declines - Quick Facts FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Google Rejects EU Antitrust Charges Nokia Sets Financial & Strategic Targets; Remains Focused On Cost Saving Program Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Walt Disney Q4 Profit Down - Update Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Walmart Introduces Black Friday 2016 Deals; Walmart App's Deals Start Today Vivendi Turns To Profit In Q3, Revenues Up; Maintains View K+S Group Posts Q3 Negative EBIT I; Cuts 2016 EBIT I View Frankfurt Airport Oct.

Business Home LBoard COMMENT Is Zaid angling for a run as MP? Scott Ng Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Wall Street opens flat as investors assess earnings Reuters | October 25, 2016 Of the 120 companies that have reported so far, 78 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. NEW YORK: Wall Street opened little changed on Tuesday as investors assessed quarterly earnings from some big names and awaited results from Apple. Dow component Merck fell 1.3 percent to $59.90, while Eli Lilly fell 2.5 percent to $75.59. Apple, which is scheduled to report results after the close of the bell, was up 0.12 percent at $117.79. 3M fell 1.9 percent to $167.97 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. Procter & Gamble rose 3.9 percent to $87.50 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.1 percent, following four quarters of contraction, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 120 companies that have reported so far, 78 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. “Investors are looking at earnings which have been okay for the most part,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. “It’s not just the numbers that investors are looking at but also what the companies are saying especially about the big macro picture.” Investors will also be keeping an eye on consumer confidence numbers for October which are expected to have fallen slightly. That data is expected at 10 a.m. At 9:45 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 12.47 points, or 0.07 percent, at 18,210.56, the S&P 500 was down 2.01 points, or 0.09 percent, at 2,149.32 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.87 points, or 0.04 percent, at 5,307.96. Six of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the consumer discretionary index’s 0.78 percent fall leading the decliners. The S&P 500 hit a two-week high on Monday, helped by strong earnings, while a flurry of acquisitions indicated corporate America continues to see untapped value in the market. Global stocks were also higher on Tuesday as upbeat economic data and signs of a revival in inflation pushed up stocks and commodity prices and kept the dollar at a nine-month high. Oil edged up ahead of the release of US crude inventory data, which in recent weeks has provided bullish surprises, but top-level comments from OPEC members regarding chances of an output cut kept a lid on prices. The dollar index was up 0.26 percent at 99.02 against a basket of major currencies, its highest level since early February. A strong dollar could dent the earnings of large multinationals. Whirlpool fell 9.8 percent at $153.61 after the home appliances maker’s revenue took a hit from a strong dollar. Under Armour fell 14.3 percent to $32.40 after the sportswear maker reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,432 to 1,143. On the Nasdaq, 1,190 issues fell and 1,000 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed nine new 52-week highs and seven new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 37 new highs and 24 new lows.

Dow component Merck fell 1.3 percent to $59.90, while Eli Lilly fell 2.5 percent to $75.59. Apple, which is scheduled to report results after the close of the bell, was up 0.12 percent at $117.79. 3M fell 1.9 percent to $167.97 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. Procter & Gamble rose 3.9 percent to $87.50 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.1 percent, following four quarters of contraction, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 120 companies that have reported so far, 78 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. "Investors are looking at earnings which have been okay for the most part," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. "It's not just the numbers that investors are looking at but also what the companies are saying especially about the big macro picture." Investors will also be keeping an eye on consumer confidence numbers for October which are expected to have fallen slightly. That data is expected at 10 a.m. ET (1400 GMT). At 9:45 a.m. ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was down 12.47 points, or 0.07 percent, at 18,210.56, the S&P 500 was down 2.01 points, or 0.09 percent, at 2,149.32 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.87 points, or 0.04 percent, at 5,307.96. Six of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the consumer discretionary index's 0.78 percent fall leading the decliners. The S&P 500 hit a two-week high on Monday, helped by strong earnings, while a flurry of acquisitions indicated corporate America continues to see untapped value in the market. Global stocks were also higher on Tuesday as upbeat economic data and signs of a revival in inflation pushed up stocks and commodity prices and kept the dollar at a nine-month high. Oil edged up ahead of the release of U.S. crude inventory data, which in recent weeks has provided bullish surprises, but top-level comments from OPEC members regarding chances of an output cut kept a lid on prices. The dollar index was up 0.26 percent at 99.02 against a basket of major currencies, its highest level since early February. A strong dollar could dent the earnings of large multinationals. Whirlpool fell 9.8 percent at $153.61 after the home appliances maker's revenue took a hit from a strong dollar. Under Armour fell 14.3 percent to $32.40 after the sportswear maker reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,432 to 1,143. On the Nasdaq, 1,190 issues fell and 1,000 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed nine new 52-week highs and seven new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 37 new highs and 24 new lows.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermidMore By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slipped from two-week highs on Tuesday as results and forecasts from companies in sectors including housing and consumer products failed to live up to expectations. Apple <AAPL.O>, the largest U.S. company by market capitalization, posted after the bell better-than-expected iPhone sales that however continued a declining trend and shares fell about 2 percent, briefly dragging S&P 500 futures <ESc1> to session lows. During the regular session, Whirlpool <WHR.N>, down 10.8 percent to $152.09, cited soft demand as it posted lower-than-expected earnings and gave an underwhelming forecast. Sherwin Williams' <SHW.N> outlook also disappointed Wall Street and shares fell 10.9 percent to $247.61. Both were an indication to some analysts that the housing sector may be cooling. "Lackluster results from Whirlpool and Sherwin Williams may indicate a slowing in the housing cycle," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. She said those results could be weighing on Home Depot <HD.N>, which was down 3.5 percent at $123.34 as the largest points decliner on the S&P 500. Lowes Cos <LOW.N> fell 3.5 percent to $68.47. Consumer products company Procter & Gamble <PG.N> rose 3.4 percent to $86.97 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, while sportswear maker Under Armour <UA.N> fell 13.2 percent to $32.89 after it reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. “We had a rally (Monday) and haven’t been able to sustain it, due to weaker-than-expected numbers from some names,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, calling the day’s earnings a "mixed bag." Overall, annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 percent, effectively putting an end to an earnings recession, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. Futures were also pressured after the bell by a late decline in oil prices <CLc1> <LCOc1> after data showed a bigger-than-expected build in U.S. crude inventories. 3M <MMM.N> fell 2.9 percent to $166.23 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. Caterpillar <CAT.N> lost 1.8 percent after a downbeat forecast, while General Motors <GM.N> fell 4.2 percent amid fears regarding future profits. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and nine new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and 73 new lows. About 6.39 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, in line with the 6.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Investors closely followed third-quarter results on Tuesday. Credit Lucas Jackson/Reuters Shaky results from consumer companies dragged the stock market lower on Tuesday as well-known names like the appliance maker Whirlpool and the athletic apparel maker Under Armour suffered their worst losses in years. Third-quarter earnings continued to dominate the market, and some of the biggest companies either reported disappointing results or lowered their expectations. Investors wondered if consumers would spend less on home improvement, clothing and other goods. But shares of companies including Procter & Gamble and Lockheed Martin soared after their reports. Looking for safer options, some investors bought bonds and utility company shares and also bid up the price of gold. Consumer spending is critical to the economy, and poor results for consumer-focused companies could be a sign of trouble. But Doug Roman, managing director of equities for PNC Capital Advisors, said it was too soon to know if shoppers were closing their wallets. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “The market might be extrapolating bigger stories into broader themes, which might not be the case,” he said. Corporate earnings have been falling for more than a year, and despite the results on Tuesday, investors are growing hopeful that streak is ending. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 8.17 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,143.16.

Whirlpool’s results fell far short of analyst projections. Sherwin-Williams had its worst day in seven years as it lost $30.27, or 10.9 percent, to $247.61. Whirlpool, which owns Maytag and KitchenAid, sank $18.37, or 10.8 percent, to $152.09, its largest loss in five years. Under Armour reported its slowest sales growth in six years and said its future sales would not be as strong as it expected a year ago. Its stock tumbled $5.01, or 13.2 percent, to $32.89, its biggest drop in almost eight years. Its rival Nike also slipped. Procter & Gamble, which makes Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, had its best day in more than a year after it reported better results than investors expected. The consumer products giant has been selling some businesses to cut costs, and it posted stronger sales of personal care products like toothbrushes and deodorants. Its stock rose $2.87, or 3.4 percent, to $86.97. The aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin surpassed investor forecasts and raised its projections for the year. Its stock gained $17.00, or 7.3 percent, to $249.26, its biggest leap in seven years. Earnings releases continued to stream in after the market closed. Apple reported lower quarterly sales and sold fewer iPhones, sending its stock down about 2 percent in late trading. The company did give a better-than-expected forecast for the holiday season. 2-Year Treasury Notes High yield in percent. 1.2 % 1.0 0.855% 0.8 0.6 ’15 ’16 OCT. 25, 2016 By The New York Times Also on Tuesday, Baker Hughes, an oil and gas drilling services company, disclosed a smaller loss than expected. Investors were also pleased that the company was preparing to cut more costs. Baker Hughes said it planned to eliminate $650 million in spending this year, up from the $500 million it had planned to cut. Its stock climbed $2.24, or 4.3 percent, to $54.39.

The company has also been trying to keep its spending in check. The stock rose $1.21, or 2 percent, to $61.95. The 3M Company, which makes Post-it Notes, industrial coatings and ceramics, forecast weaker sales growth and a smaller profit for the year. The stock declined $5.04, or 2.9 percent, to $166.23. Nielsen, the media and marketing information company, took its biggest loss ever after it reported shaky results and cut its guidance. Nielsen stock tumbled $9.28, or 16.9 percent, to $45.65. Benchmark crude lost 56 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $49.96 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 67 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $50.79 a barrel in London. Bond prices edged higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.76 percent from 1.77 percent. Investors bought shares of utility companies and sought out precious metals amid uncertainty. The price of gold futures for October delivery rose $9.90 to $1,271.90 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The dollar slipped to 104.19 yen from 104.21 yen. The euro rose to $1.0888 from $1.0872. A version of this article appears in print on October 26, 2016, on page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: As Some Big Names Disappoint, Market Dips.

Video provided by TheStreet Newslook Trader Patrick McKeon, center, works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Monday, Oct. 24, 2016. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) (Photo: Richard Drew, AP) U.S. stocks fell Tuesday as investors digest an avalanche of corporate earnings that were mixed, with blue chip consumer-products maker Procter & Gamble faring well but others like heavy equipment maker Caterpillar disappointing Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 54 points, or 0.3%, to close at 18,169. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index fell 0.4% to 2143 and the Nasdaq composite was 0.5% lower to 5283. Wall Street got a large slate of earnings reports from Dow components, including well-received reports from P&G (PG), which reported organic growth of 3%, as well as United Technologies (UTX), and drug maker Merck (MRK), which topped forecast with the help of strong sales of its cancer drug Keytruda. But the good news was offset by weaker-than-expected results from companies like 3M (MMM) and Caterpillar (CAT), which cut its earnings view for the remainder of 2016, citing sluggish sales of its heavy equipment. P&G shares rose 3.4%. Merck's stock rose  2%. And United Technologies shares jumped 1.9%. Caterpillar fell 1.8% and 3M fell 3%. Shares of Dow component and chemical giant DuPont (DD) fell 0.7% despite topping profit and sales forecast and boosting its full-year 2016 earnings outlook. 3M shares fell 3% and Caterpillar's stock was unchanged. Caterpillar's outgoing CEO Doug Oberhelman, who is retiring later this year, painted a gloomy picture of the global economy, noting that "economic weakness throughout much of the world persists," in a press release containing the company's earnings results. USA TODAY History suggests S&P set up for future gains With the presidential election now two weeks away, investors are also bracing for the homestretch of the campaign and gearing up for any potential surprises. Stocks have held up nicely in recent sessions as the third-quarter earnings season has gotten off to a better-than-expected start. Earnings growth for the July-thru-September quarter is above 1% currently, which has raised hopes that the quarterly streak of contracting earnings growth will end at four. In economic news, consumer confidence fell more than expected in October, according to the Conference Board. But data on the U.S. housing market remained solid. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. home price index rose 0.2% in August and another index that tracks purchase prices saw an uptick of 0.7% in August, according to FHFA. iPhone maker Apple reports its quarterly profit results after today's closing bell.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: U.S. stocks slipped from two-week highs on Tuesday as results and forecasts from companies in sectors including housing and consumer products failed to live up to expectations. Apple , the largest U.S. company by market capitalization, posted after the bell better-than-expected iPhone sales that however continued a declining trend and shares fell about 2 percent, briefly dragging S&P 500 futures to session lows. During the regular session, Whirlpool , down 10.8 percent to US$152.09, cited soft demand as it posted lower-than-expected earnings and gave an underwhelming forecast. Sherwin Williams' outlook also disappointed Wall Street and shares fell 10.9 percent to US$247.61. Both were an indication to some analysts that the housing sector may be cooling. "Lackluster results from Whirlpool and Sherwin Williams may indicate a slowing in the housing cycle," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. She said those results could be weighing on Home Depot , which was down 3.5 percent at US$123.34 as the largest points decliner on the S&P 500. Lowes Cos fell 3.5 percent to US$68.47. Consumer products company Procter & Gamble rose 3.4 percent to US$86.97 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, while sportswear maker Under Armour fell 13.2 percent to US$32.89 after it reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. “We had a rally (Monday) and haven’t been able to sustain it, due to weaker-than-expected numbers from some names,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, calling the day’s earnings a "mixed bag." Overall, annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 percent, effectively putting an end to an earnings recession, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. Futures were also pressured after the bell by a late decline in oil prices after data showed a bigger-than-expected build in U.S. crude inventories. 3M fell 2.9 percent to US$166.23 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. Caterpillar lost 1.8 percent after a downbeat forecast, while General Motors fell 4.2 percent amid fears regarding future profits. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and nine new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and 73 new lows. About 6.39 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, in line with the 6.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Dow component Merck rose 2.2 percent to $62.10 in premarket trading, while Procter & Gamble was up 2.6 percent at $86.34 after reporting earnings above expectations. Apple, which is scheduled to report results after the close of the bell, was up 0.37 percent at $118.08. Annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.1 percent, following four quarters of contraction, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 120 companies that have reported so far, 78 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. "Investors are looking at earnings which have been okay for the most part," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. "It's not just the numbers that investors are looking at but also what the companies are saying especially about the big macro picture." Investors will also be keeping an eye on consumer confidence numbers for October which are expected to have fallen slightly. That data is expected at 10 a.m. ET (1400 GMT). S&P 500 e-minis were up 2.5 points, or 0.12 percent, with 94,687 contracts traded at 8:34 a.m. ET (1234 GMT). Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 9.5 points, or 0.19 percent, on volume of 18,618 contracts. Dow e-minis were up 16 points, or 0.09 percent, with 17,963 contracts changing hands. The S&P 500 hit a two-week high on Monday, helped by strong earnings, while a flurry of acquisitions indicated corporate America continues to see untapped value in the market. Global stocks were also higher on Tuesday as upbeat economic data and signs of a revival in inflation pushed up stocks and commodity prices and kept the dollar at a nine-month high. Oil edged up ahead of the release of U.S. crude inventory data, which in recent weeks has provided bullish surprises, but top-level comments from OPEC members regarding chances of an output cut kept a lid on prices. The dollar index was little changed at 98.83 against a basket of major currencies, after touching its highest level since early February, last week. A strong dollar could dent the earnings of large multinationals. Whirlpool fell 6 percent at $163.23 after the home appliances maker's revenue took a hit from a strong dollar. 3M fell 2.2 percent to $167.50 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. Caterpillar slipped 1.7 percent to $84.55 after reporting a sharply lower quarterly profit.

Wall Street was set to tick higher with consumer confidence figures due and analysts already tucking into healthy-looking earnings from Procter & Gamble, General Motors and drugs giant Merck, but also a profit downgrade from Caterpillar. Europe had been cheered as Germany's Dax hit its highest level of the year after the closely-watched Ifo survey beat expectations a day after purchasing manager numbers had done the same. The region's mining firms were the standout performers though. They hit a 14-month top as zinc surged to a five-year peak and iron ore reached its highest since mid-2014, all of which should pick up the pulse of inflation globally. "We are seeing a pick-up of economic activity against the backdrop of only one central bank - the Fed - that is likely to tighten policy and that is supporting asset markets," said CMC Markets senior analyst Michael Hewson. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar took a breather having reached its highest since early February against other top currencies as traders continued to add to the bets on a December U.S. interest rate rise <_0FF:_>. China's yuan went the other way, hitting its lowest since "offshore" trading was introduced in 2010 as Beijing nudged down official rates again. It traded as soft as 6.7882 yuan per dollar. The currency's fall of more than 1.5 percent since the end of September has stirred renewed suspicion of a possible extended slide in the yuan, even though officials have reiterated their expectations for a stable currency. But the weakness has revived memories of a shock yuan devaluation last August and another rapid depreciation early this year - falls that triggered a bout of global market turmoil. Analysts pointed out, however, that during this round of yuan weakness, global risk sentiment was holding up. "That highlights the extent to which dollar gains are unlikely to be as extended as they were (in the past)," said BNP Paribas currency strategist Sam Lynton-Brown, in London. GOLDEN MINERS The cheer around the mining sector was increased further as a production update thrust London-listed giant Anglo American's shares up over 3 percent to take their gains this year to almost 270 percent. The staggering rise has made Anglo the top performing stock on Europe's STOXX 600 this year. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.7 percent to close at a six-month high as a softening yen burnished the outlook for the country's exporters. Australian stocks added 0.6 percent and Taiwan 0.7 percent. Wall Street was taking encouragement from upbeat corporate results. Over one third of U.S. companies have now reported and 80 percent have beaten market expectations. Another third of the S&P 500 components are scheduled to report earnings later this week, including heavyweights Apple , Alphabet, Amazon and Boeing. Merger and acquisition activity added extra fizz in the wake of AT&T Inc's $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner Inc , though the deal seemed destined to face stringent scrutiny from regulators. Safe-haven bonds were feeling the strain of the bullish mood elsewhere with U.S. Treasury yields up to almost 1.78 percent again and European yields creeping higher. In commodities, oil prices briefly dipped on news of the impending restart of Britain's Buzzard oilfield and Iraq's wish to be exempted from OPEC production cuts. Brent was down 5 cents at $51.41 a barrel, while U.S. crude hovered at $50.50. But going the other way were metals with zinc, nickel, copper and tin all shining and Chinese iron ore futures reaching their highest since August 2014. Coal prices also reached new peaks after weeks of gains, a prop for the Australian dollar as the two commodities are the country's biggest export earners. Another mover was the Canadian dollar which rebounded from a seven-month low after Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said the decision on whether to cut interest rates again was not one to take lightly. The comments countered recent speculation about an imminent easing and nudged the U.S. dollar down to C$1.3333 from a peak at C$1.3398.

Home Mail News Sport Finance Celebrity Style Weather Answers Flickr Mobile More Yahoo Search Search Mail News Home Follow us UK Yahoo Originals World Finance Sport Motoring Science & Tech Celebrity TV Movies Style Weather News Video Viral U.S. stocks slip on earnings, dollar off highs By Hilary Russ25 October 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Share View photos Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., October 25, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidMore By Hilary Russ NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on disappointing earnings reports on Tuesday, while the U.S. dollar slipped from multi-month highs after Chancellor Governor Mark Carney cast doubt on expectations for more monetary stimulus. Oil prices fell more than 1 percent, with U.S. crude breaking below $50 per barrel for a second straight day, ahead of weekly data that could show a build in inventories. On Wall Street, nine of the eleven sectors in the benchmark S&P 500 stock index closed lower, with housing and consumer products companies among those failing to live up to forecasts on third-quarter earnings. Shares of some big names, including Whirlpool, General Motors Co, Caterpillar Inc and 3M, all lost ground. "We had a rally (Monday) and haven't been able to sustain it, due to weaker-than-expected numbers from some names," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois. He called the day's earnings report a "mixed bag" for stocks. Another third of the S&P 500 is scheduled to report earnings this week, including heavyweights Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Boeing. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. The dollar was a hair lower against a basket of major currencies after touching an eight-month high. Growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in December had boosted the dollar to its highest level in more than seven months against the euro and about three months against the yen. When BoE policymakers meet next week to consider whether to cut interest rates, they will "undoubtedly" take sterling's weakness into account, BoE Governor Mark Carney told lawmakers on Tuesday. "Carney's comments cast doubt on easing from Europe," said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. Sterling slumped to its lowest level since the Oct. 7 "flash crash" but recovered some of its losses on Carney's remarks. The pound was last down 0.47 percent. In European stocks, mining companies rose 3.2 percent, lifted in part by Anglo American, up 4.55 percent after its production update. Anglo is the top-performing stock on Europe's STOXX 600 this year. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index extended gains, closing up 0.45 percent. Germany's DAX turned slightly lower, ending down 0.04 percent, after hitting its highest level of the year. The closely-watched Ifo survey beat expectations, a day after purchasing manager numbers had done the same. Metal prices surged, with zinc up 2.37 percent at $2,366.85, but off an earlier three-week high of $2,376. It is up nearly 60 percent from January lows on worries about shortages. Other commodity prices slipped, though, as many are priced in U.S. dollars. U.S. crude oil futures settled 56 cents lower at $49.96 per barrel, down 1.11 percent.

Wed, Nov 16, 2016, 00:44 GMT - UK Markets open in 7 hrs 16 mins GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks, commodities climb as economic confidence risesReuters - UK Focus – Tue, Oct 25, 2016 13:20 BST Share 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Companies: Merck KGaA BNP Paribas SA Anglo American plc RELATED QUOTES Symbol Price Change 0O14.L 88.095 -1.720 BNP.PA 55.49 -0.17 AAL.L 1,096.50 -78.50 6549.TWO 23.20 +1.10 AAPL.SW 104.90 -2.10 * Europe pushes higher as DAX hits year to date high * US dollar supported after solid manufacturing survey * Wall St expected to tick higher on upbeat earnings, M&A frenzy * Oil drifts lower but steel, industrial commodities on the rise By Marc Jones LONDON, Oct (Shenzhen: 000069.SZ - news) 25 (Reuters) - World markets (Xetra: 4WM.DE - news) had a swagger about them on Tuesday as upbeat economic data and signs of a revival in inflation pushed up stocks and commodity prices and kept the dollar at a nine-month high. Wall Street was set to tick higher with consumer confidence figures due and analysts already tucking into healthy-looking earnings from Procter & Gamble, General Motors (NYSE: GM - news) and drugs giant Merck (LSE: 0O14.L - news) , but also a profit downgrade from Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT - news) . Europe had been cheered as Germany's Dax hit its highest level of the year after the closely-watched Ifo survey beat expectations a day after purchasing manager numbers had done the same. The region's mining firms were the standout performers though. They hit a 14-month top as zinc surged to a five-year peak and iron ore reached its highest since mid-2014, all of which should pick up the pulse of inflation globally. "We are seeing a pick-up of economic activity against the backdrop of only one central bank - the Fed - that is likely to tighten policy and that is supporting asset markets," said CMC (Shanghai: 600327.SS - news) Markets senior analyst Michael Hewson. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar took a breather having reached its highest since early February against other top currencies as traders continued to add to the bets on a December U.S. interest rate rise . China's yuan went the other way, hitting its lowest since "offshore" trading was introduced in 2010 as Beijing nudged down official rates again. It traded as soft as 6.7882 yuan per dollar. The currency's fall of more than 1.5 percent since the end of September has stirred renewed suspicion of a possible extended slide in the yuan, even though officials have reiterated their expectations for a stable currency. But the weakness has revived memories of a shock yuan devaluation last August and another rapid depreciation early this year - falls that triggered a bout of global market turmoil. Analysts pointed out, however, that during this round of yuan weakness, global risk sentiment was holding up. "That highlights the extent to which dollar gains are unlikely to be as extended as they were (in the past)," said BNP (Paris: FR0000131104 - news) Paribas currency strategist Sam Lynton-Brown, in London. GOLDEN MINERS The cheer around the mining sector was increased further as a production update thrust London-listed giant Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news) 's shares up over 3 percent to take their gains this year to almost 270 percent. The staggering rise has made Anglo the top performing stock on Europe's STOXX 600 this year. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.7 percent to close at a six-month high as a softening yen burnished the outlook for the country's exporters. Australian stocks added 0.6 percent and Taiwan (Taiwan OTC: 6549.TWO - news) 0.7 percent. Wall Street was taking encouragement from upbeat corporate results. Over one third of U.S. companies have now reported and 80 percent have beaten market expectations. Another third of the S&P 500 components are scheduled to report earnings later this week, including heavyweights Apple (Swiss: AAPL.SW - news) , Alphabet (Xetra: ABEA.DE - news) , Amazon and Boeing (NYSE: BA - news) . Merger and acquisition activity added extra fizz in the wake of AT&T Inc (Sao Paolo: ATTB34F.SA - news) 's $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner Inc (Xetra: AOL1.DE - news) , though the deal seemed destined to face stringent scrutiny from regulators. Safe-haven bonds were feeling the strain of the bullish mood elsewhere with U.S. Treasury yields up to almost 1.78 percent again and European yields creeping higher. In commodities, oil prices briefly dipped on news of the impending restart of Britain's Buzzard oilfield and Iraq's wish to be exempted from OPEC production cuts. Brent was down 5 cents at $51.41 a barrel, while U.S. crude hovered at $50.50. But going the other way were metals with zinc, nickel, copper and tin all shining and Chinese iron ore futures reaching their highest since August 2014. Coal prices also reached new peaks after weeks of gains, a prop for the Australian dollar as the two commodities are the country's biggest export earners. Another mover was the Canadian dollar which rebounded from a seven-month low after Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said the decision on whether to cut interest rates again was not one to take lightly. The comments countered recent speculation about an imminent easing and nudged the U.S. dollar down to C$1.3333 from a peak at C$1.3398.

Who We Are Politics Article Comments Your Email Recipient's Email Message (Optional) Send Cancel Frelinghuysen Challenged by Underfinanced Democrat in 11th Joe Tyrrell | October 25, 2016 Lawyer Joe Wenzel says he was inspired to run by Sandy Hook Elementary School killings in 2012 Rodney Frelinghuysen, 11-term Republican incumbent in 11th District Stretching from the misty Ramapo Mountains to lush Morris County estates, from Ogdensburg to West Orange, the 11th Congressional District offers a layer of polish over a bit of grit. Yes, garden parties are frequent, but the 11th also showcases military might at Picatinny Arsenal and throbbing commerce in regional malls and long-established downtowns. People who live here tend to be better educated and better off than the average New Jerseyan, though some of that has changed through redistricting. While the district was almost 87 percent white in the 2000 Census, the figure is now closer to 73 percent with more towns in Passaic County added to the Morris County core. The 11th still covers a bit of Essex County, its base for much of the 20th century, and a few towns in Sussex County. That multi-county conglomeration brings together towns with different populations and priorities, but in the aggregate its voters are faithfully Republican. No one captures the old-time, old-money GOP vibe better than 11-term incumbent Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, 70, scion of one of New Jersey's oldest political dynasties and largest fortunes. His mother was a Procter & Gamble heir, while his father served 22 years in the House of Representatives, a record Frelinghuysen stands poised to surpass. Joe Wenzel, Democratic challenger for Congress in District 11 Joe Wenzel, the Democratic candidate, is a West Orange lawyer who previously served a stint on the school board in Clifton. Wenzel said he was energized to run by Congress's failure to address gun violence after the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Libertarian Jeff Hetrick and Thomas DePasquale, running under the tag of the “Financial Independence Party,” widen the options for voters dissatisfied with the status quo. But Frelinghuysen and Wenzel, who had the backing of three of the district's four Democratic county organizations, both easily won contested primaries. Frelinghuysen has more tangible support. In this election cycle. His campaign has reported more than $1.8 million in contributions and had $658,953 on hand at the end of September, according to the Federal Elections Commission. His political action committee, Liberty & Prosperity, reported $270,449 in receipts. None of the other candidates reported any fundraising. Well positioned as a member of the House Appropriations Committee and chair of its defense appropriations subcommittee, Frelinghuysen draws significant contributions from the aerospace and pharmaceutical industries. Jeff Hetrick, Libertarian candidate for Congressional seat in District 11 Hetrick, 38, of Chatham Township, has made two unsuccessful runs for state Assembly. He works in quality assurance, which he says has brought him into contact with businesses in a range of major industries. He promises to vote against "any legislation that I believe would increase the size and scope of government." As "a strong advocate of term limits," Hetrick said it is time for Frelinghuysen to retire. Neither major party candidate attended a recent debate, DePasquale said, because "the Democrat knows he can't win and the Republican knows he's a shoo-in." Districts have been drawn to protect incumbents, meaning "voters don't have a real choice," said DePasquale, 57, of Wayne. Thomas DePasquale is running for Congress in the 11th District on the Financial Independence Party ticket. The owner of a tax preparation business, DePasquale wants to curb the federal deficit and stop job-killing trade deals. He acknowledged third-party candidates face long odds. "I'm trying to bring awareness to what's wrong with the system," he said. To Wenzel, it is time for new leadership in Washington. The Sandy Hook slaughter of school children seemed to demand mature discussion but produced "resounding silence" in the Congress, he said — "Not one bill was passed, not one committee hearing called, no one thing changed." Gun control does not strike Frelinghuysen as a pressing matter.  He has said civilians probably do not need assault weapons but added many of his colleagues are uncomfortable with stricter gun laws. In 2002, the National Rifle Association gave Frelinghuysen's positions the lowest score among New Jersey congressional Republicans, 23 percent favorable. But in recent years he has received a solid "B" rating from the group. The Vietnam veteran is worried about the effects of "America's retreat from the world stage" under President Barack Obama. For a member of Congress "there is no greater responsibility" than providing a strong national defense and homeland security, Frelinghuysen said. At the district level, that has meant continued funding for Picatinny Arsenal, the headquarters of the U.S. Army's armament research, development, and engineering. Wenzel said Congress has ignored the threat posed to the world, the country, and New Jersey by rising sea levels and the other effects of climate change caused by overuse of fossil fuels and man-made chemicals. He recalled learning about the problems as a student at Rutgers University more than two decades ago. But he argued there is still an opportunity to start fixing the problem. Trade agreements with fast developing countries like India and China could include steps to limit hazardous emissions, according to Wenzel. Wenzel and Frelinghuysen agree that securing a better economic future should be a major priority. Wenzel argues that embracing technological change is part of the solution. He points to the many successful entrepreneurs in the tech sector as models for other businesses. If elected, he would propose funding for small-business incubators across the country, as well as small loans and grants to help startups get off the ground. Frelinghuysen said Congress and the administration should work together toward “economic freedom." Higher taxes and regulations and the "threat of increased government mandates" hamper growth, he said. He called for reversing President Obama's "policies that drive up gas prices." Frelinghuysen favors "unlocking American energy production" to provide jobs and reduce dependence of foreign oil. Frelinghuysen also contends the Obamacare health insurance system is damaging the economy and should be reworked. He supports retaining the provisions that prevent insurers from citing "pre-existing conditions" to deny coverage but would also limit lawsuits. Wenzel would move toward a single-payer health insurance system, such as Canada's comprehensive Medicare or Taiwan's national health insurance. Some American proponents describe it as "Medicare for all," with a national program that would pay for coverage while private professionals would continue to provide care.

That's because many companies including Snapdeal and SLK Global Solutions, among others, are gifting exciting experiences to their employees, be it a romantic yacht ride with one's partner, recording one's own song in a studio, or flying a microlight. Corporate gifting is going beyond cash award, gift vouchers, conventional certificates, medals and trophies as an increasing representation of millennials in the workforce is prompting companies to think of experiences as gifts. Giftxoxo, a tech-enabled marketplace for experiences and activities, has a host of leading corporates such as BCG, Flipkart, Procter & Gamble, and BlueJeans Network India using its platform to gift experiences to their people. BCG and Flipkart did not respond to emails with queries about their gifting plans as of press time on Monday while P&G refused to participate in this story. "Gifting has evolved in recent times. Even a couple of years back acceptance of this was tough," said Sumit Khandelwal, cofounder at Giftxoxo. "But we have really seen a pickup in the last 6-12 months," he said. This festive season on an average Giftxoxo is getting 10-12 leads from corporates a day compared to 10-12 a month a year ago, Khandelwal said. Ecommerce major Snapdeal gifts experiences to its employees with to make recognition social, its HR director Abhishek Budhraja said. "Giving cash takes away the entire feeling of recognition and we wanted to move away from that," he said. "Instead of giving a voucher we thought we would engage with a portal that has option for every employee," Budhraja said. Some of the experiences popular among Snapdeal employees include parasailing, hot air balloon, Royal Enfield ride around Delhi, and fine dining experience at a five star hotel, he said. The HR head of a global cloud service provider, said, "The entire idea is to move away from cash related things as we wanted to cater to our younger set of employees. We want them to really remember the recognition given to them and feel a sense of pride." The average age group of employees in the company is 28 and for somebody like that the experiences that the company brings to the table are exciting. The company uses experience gifting for peer-to-peer recognition, referral bonus, and quarterly awards. One of India's biggest information technology companies has been running experience gifting as a pilot for the last eight months for its long service awards (10-15-20-25 years). Some of the gifts it has given include a romantic dinner on top of the world at a helipad in Bengaluru and exotic spa experience. "This is a novel concept and the company is running it as a pilot as it wants to give these experience to employees to celebrate the milestones," said an employee. Process outsourcing company SLK Global Solutions wanted to gift its employees experiences that they keep dreaming of and make them feel special and wanted for their contribution and achievement at work. "Experience gifting has gone down very well with the employees. The new generation welcomes it and it allows us to connect closely with them," said Taruna Lohmror, programme director for HR at SLK Global Solutions. Some of the popular experiences being gifted by corporates in the country include a romantic private gourmet session on a helipad, pizza making session at a fivestar hotel, playing RJ or DJ for a day, private island dining with a spa, horse riding session followed by stable management ending with an exotic Italian dinner at the stable, and romantic yacht ride with one's partner in the Arabian Sea.

Stay prepared. See what we see ahead for U.S. markets -- now, via this risk-free offer to the Financial Forecast Service. *********  [Editor's Note: The text version of the story is below.] About a third of S&P companies report earnings this week, including Apple, Amazon, Proctor & Gamble, Exxon and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. It's earnings season, and most investors are paying close attention (Reuters, Oct. 9): "If there's something that can help the outlook for earnings, then it's going to be good news for the stock market. It is the most important variable," said [a] chief investment officer. The belief that earnings drive stock prices permeates Wall Street. That sentiment was also expressed in an Oct. 21 CNBC article: Strategists are watching whether earnings growth will sustain further gains in the market. But do corporate earnings really determine the stock market's trend? In a word, the answer is "no." Let's look at just one sample of the evidence from the February 2010 Elliott Wave Theorist: The chart shows that in 1973-1974, earnings per share for S&P 500 companies soared for six quarters in a row, during which time the S&P suffered its largest decline since 1937-1942. This is not a small departure from the expected relationship; it is a history-making departure. Earnings soared, and stocks had their largest collapse for the entire period from 1938 through 2007, a 70-year span! Moreover, the S&P bottomed in early October 1974, and earnings per share then turned down for twelve straight months, just as the S&P turned up! Many market commentators either ignore or are unaware of the evidence which challenges the bedrock theory that earnings drive stock prices. Hence, investors feel safe when corporate earnings are good. They are wary when earnings are bad. These sentiments make sense in an exogenous-cause world. But, as the Theorist has noted: Financial market prices are not set in an exogenous-cause world. You don't buy stocks on record earnings; you buy them on bad earnings. The idea of buying stocks on awful earnings might seem radical, but think back to February-March 2009, when S&P companies were reporting losses, not gains. Even though most of the investment world was gripped with fear, a Special Investment Issue of the Theorist published on Feb. 23, 2009 and said: I recommend covering our short position at today's close. ... Our main job is to keep the money we have. If we exit now, we will do that. Just 10 trading days later on March 9, 2009, the Dow Industrials bottomed and has since advanced about 177%. That market call was based on the Wave Principle, not an exogenous factor like corporate earnings. Remember, the Dow Industrials started its years-long advance when corporations were reporting losses.

N E X T Email Print Save Text:  A A We Are How We Eat: How Grocery Shopping Data Reveals the New Consumer by Rebecca Brooks  |   October 24, 2016  |  1,136 views Tweet Kindle Email Top Change is everywhere. Aging Boomers are moving in with their children, and Millennials linger at home. Dual-income families are more commonplace than ever. And in just three decades, the number of women in the workforce has risen by 20%, shifting their traditional purchasing roles in the marketplace. Many of us have seen our jobs become more time-consuming and demanding, as management wants round-the-clock attention and faster servicing. Shifts in lifestyle are also affecting the way consumers interact with brands. The brand-consumer relationship has transformed dramatically before our eyes and continues to do so. Moreover, new technologies are changing the shopping experience. Those changes are so profound that even something as fundamental as grocery shopping is evolving in completely new ways. Using grocery consumer packaged goods (CPG) as the lens through which we view those changes, we can start to proactively influence change rather than just react to the new consumer. Intelligent shopper insights can help ignite change and inspiration, and allow brands to thrive in a changing landscape. Where We Came From Research on shopping behaviors with CPG is not new. It originated with pioneering research Daniel Starch in the early 20th century. He researched and devised methods to assess the effectiveness of advertising based on CPG purchase behaviors. His research explored consumer recall and interest based on brand advertising—a model used by large companies like General Mills, Proctor & Gamble and many more. Those early models were widely adopted and evolved very little until the 1980s and 1990s, when the "emotional" element was added. Digital Paradigm There has been a lot of denial and resistance to how digital would change our lives as researchers, marketers, and the brands we represent. Initially, we didn't understand how big the digital wave would be—nor its widespread repercussions. In the early 2000s, the epic failures of many of the more promising "dotcoms" seemed to reassure us that changes to our model were not eminent. As digital influence rose and affected all parts of life, however, many companies had to scramble to keep up. We started "duct-taping" existing models to show they can still work—treating digital as just another channel in a multipronged marketing campaign. That didn't work either. We are missing the mark with the new consumer. What Grocery Can Tell Us Grocery is changing and will be shopped entirely differently in the next few years. Shopping apps, beacons, loyalty programs, virtual and augmented reality, and more are creating a sea change in the retail sector. Millennials and Gen Z (Digital Natives) are approaching grocery shopping differently than previous generations did. The new generations have an openness, a promiscuous attitude, toward products as well as a propensity to spend more on higher-quality products that resonate with them on a social level—sustainable, cause-oriented, local, etc. The interplay of price and the added value of a quality or interesting product is very fluid. These shoppers can change priorities often. Based on data from 1,000 shoppers who have bought groceries in the last 24 hours, plus data from shopper journey studies collected over the past six years, we found some interesting trends: 47% of Digital Natives look for product recommendations and suggestions before buying (vs. 31% of older generations) 57% love to be the first to know about new products (vs. 42% of older generations) 64% like to browse aisles to discover new products (vs. 55% of older generations) In short, the Digital Native must be the center of the shopping experience. Interactions with a brand must be easy and convenient, and hit every touchpoint the shopper wishes to explore. From chatter on social media to help the decision-making process all the way to purchase and delivery, the entire process must be seamless. The traditional siloed framework for marketing and selling don't work. Brands must create an end-to-end process that thinks of the new consumer first at every step. What Now? Everything about the way we shop is different and will continue to evolve, according to research. "Duct-taping" doesn't work anymore. Old models should be discarded, and we should rethink the way we do market brands from the ground up as if we were inventing it today. That can mean everything from using new tools for market research, such as digital engagement and reframing the treatment of research respondents, all the way to completely revamping the markers we select for brand success. Today's digital consumer may not be loyal, but we can measure things like awareness, consideration, and advocacy for a picture of performance. To fit the demands of the new consumer, brands need to provide clear, easy access to information. We are used to having every question answered with a simple touch on the screen. Brands need to give their target audiences the information they need so that they don't find it elsewhere. Finding that sweet spot where things like price, value, and meaning come together can help change the way brands are marketing.

The major index futures are currently pointing to a higher open for the markets, with the Dow futures up by 94 points. Early buying interest may be generated in reaction to the latest earnings news, as the quarterly reporting season hits full stride. Visa (V), 3M (MMM), Caterpillar (CAT), General Motors (GM), Procter & Gamble (PG), Sprint (S), AT&T (T), Coca-Cola (KO), Dow Chemical (DOW), Sony (SNE), UPS (UPS), Twitter (TWTR), and Exxon Mobil (XOM) are just a few of the companies due to report their results this week. Overall trading activity may be somewhat subdued, however, as a lack of major U.S. economic data may keep some traders on the sidelines. Reports on consumer confidence, new home sales, durable goods orders, and third quarter GDP are likely to attract attention in the coming days. Stocks turned in another relatively lackluster performance during trading on Friday, as traders focused on the latest batch of earnings news amid a quiet day on the U.S. economic front. The major averages eventually ended the session on opposite sides of the unchanged line. While the Nasdaq rose 15.57 points or 0.3 percent to 5,257.40, the Dow dipped 16.64 points or 0.1 percent to 18,145.71 and the S&P 500 edged down 0.18 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 2,141.16. For the week, the Dow edged slightly higher, while the S&P 500 climbed by 0.4 and the Nasdaq advanced by 0.8 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com The Most Influential Books In Business Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America More Commentary -Global Taiwan Stock Market May Snap Losing Streak Singapore Bourse Likely To Crack Resistance At 2,800 Points Malaysia Market May Extend Tuesday's Gains South Korea Shares May Find Traction On Wednesday Stocks Close Mostly Higher Following Upbeat Retail Sales Data - U.S. Commentary Major Averages Remain Mixed In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary European Markets Finish Mostly Higher, But Little Changed Overall Nasdaq And S&P 500 Move Higher But Dow Gives Back Ground - U.S. Commentary Stocks May Open Higher On Upbeat Retail Sales Data - U.S. Commentary Wall Street Aims At Higher Opening Sensex Plunges 514 Points On Capital Outflow Worries; Nifty Nears 8,200 European Shares Cling To Gains After Data Deluge FTSE 100 Breaches 6800 As Pound Extends Slide CAC 40 Extends Gains As Oil Rallies DAX Gives Up Early Gains <<Previous        50 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Home Depot Lifts FY EPS View In Line With Market As Q3 Results Top Estimates Vodafone Slips To Pre-Tax Loss On Hefty India Charge; Narrows FY View Merck KgaA Lifts FY16 Earnings View As Q3 Results Climb, Stock Up Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone Amaya Gets Huge Buyout Bid From Former CEO Zuckerberg: Facebook Hoax News Did Not Get Trump Elected Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Siemens To Buy Mentor Graphics For $4.5 Bln Enterprise Value Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy ADAP Surges As FDA Lifts Clinical Hold, OCUL Catches Eyes, RegeneRx On The Rise AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet Forget Canada: The Best Places To Escape Trump's America ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD Pfizer : IBRANCE Approved In Europe To Treat HR+/HER2- Metastatic Breast Cancer Engie 9-month EBITDA Declines - Quick Facts FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Google Rejects EU Antitrust Charges Nokia Sets Financial & Strategic Targets; Remains Focused On Cost Saving Program Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Walt Disney Q4 Profit Down - Update Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Walmart Introduces Black Friday 2016 Deals; Walmart App's Deals Start Today Vivendi Turns To Profit In Q3, Revenues Up; Maintains View K+S Group Posts Q3 Negative EBIT I; Cuts 2016 EBIT I View Frankfurt Airport Oct.

Dubai’s Jebel Ali Free Zone (JAFZA) has been using major industrial trade shows around the world to court companies, touting its attributes as the UAE’s trade and logistics hub for the wider Middle East region, and also as an “ideal site” to set up manufacturing and trading operations. The recent Automechanika trade show of Frankfurt, rated as the world’s largest event for the auto-parts and components sector, was a prominent venue where JAFZA set up a pavilion-size booth to recruit companies to set up operations at its facility. In an interview with the American Journal of Transportation at the Automechanika show, Ibrahim Mohamed Al Janahi, the deputy CEO and chief commercial officer of JAFZA, said that over 7,000 companies from over 120 countries had established operations in the JAFZA. These, he added, included more than 100 of the 500 Fortune companies.  “About 73% of them are in trading, storage, transhipment while some 23% are engaged in manufacturing and assembly operations.  We have Nestle, Mars, Proctor and Gamble, to name a few names.  The UAE (United Arab Emirates) has a population of nine million … our biggest trading partners are China, India, Middle East, Iran, Britain, France and Germany,” he explained.

Boeing, Coca-Cola and dozens of others report earnings ahead of the opening bell. Apple, which reported after the bell Tuesday, was a negative factor for stock futures in late trading. The stock was down around 3 percent after it reported a decline in profits and revenues. Apple, the biggest U.S. company, can easily impact sentiment. "I think it's psychologically very important," said Don Townswick, director of equities at Conning. "Apple earnings are almost more important for the overall market than they are for Apple." Apple net income slid nearly 20 percent to $9 billion, but earnings per share beat forecasts by a penny at $1.67. The market focused on revenues of $46.9 billion, just below consensus of $46.94 billion. Sales of the company's iPhone were 45.5 million, more than the 44.8 million expected but shipments of Mac computers were below consensus. There is also oil inventory data Wednesday morning at 10:30 a.m. EDT, and if American Petroleum Institute's late Tuesday report is a guide, there could be a bigger-than-expected build in inventories, a bearish trend. The API data showed a 4.8 million barrel increase in crude supply in the U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude sank closer to $49, after earlier closing down 1.1 percent at $49.96 per barrel, below $50 for the first time since Oct. 17. "I was expecting 2.4 million. It looks like imports rebounded by a good amount," said John Kilduff of Again Capital. Oil was lower earlier Tuesday on increasing doubt that OPEC and other oil producers will be able to make a deal to curb production and stabilize oil prices. "At some point you had to expect the market to call them out on what they're doing or not doing. Their deeds again just don't match their words, almost to a member. At some point, the rhetoric game gets played out," said Kilduff. He noted there were reports that an unnamed Russian official said that country would not cut production. There is also a $34 billion five-year note auction Wednesday, and it's being watched carefully after a soft two-year auction Tuesday. Strategists said some of the weakness — and rise in rates — had to do with anticipation about the Fed's November meeting next week. "How much do they emphasize a December rate hike? I think it's pretty much priced in and barring a disaster, they're looking for that one rate hike in 2016," said Cantor Fitzgerald rate strategist Justin Lederer. The market expects the Fed to stay on hold at the November meeting but to hike for the second time in 10 years in December, if the economy remains on track. "I don't think you're really going to see rates spike higher on this. It's not like it was a year ago when you had December hike, and the Fed was looking for four this year," he said. "Here we are and the trajectory is very shallow. Before an election, I don't think they want to see anything crazy going on, before the election." Next week's Fed meeting is six days before the presidential election, and that's one reason economists expect the Fed to wait until December. "I think the Fed being where they are now has hurt economic activity. They've sapped confidence," said Townswick. "I hope they start to raise and after the election, they don't have to be accused of politicking or either being accused of causing a recession or causing a candidate to lose." Meanwhile, earnings have been a mixed catalyst with Procter & Gamble, for instance, jumping on its report Tuesday, but fellow Dow stock 3M fell sharply on its earnings. Besides Boeing and P&G, earnings expected Wednesday morning include CNBC parent Comcast, Norfolk Southern, Northrop Grumman, GlaxoSmithKline, Ingersoll-Rand, Nasdaq, State Street, Southwest Air, Nintendo, WR Grace, Bayer and Boston Scientific. Texas Instruments, Tesla, F5 Networks, VMWare, Shutterfly, Rent-A-Center, Ocwen, Raymond James, Buffalo Wild Wings, Groupon, Samsung and dozens of others report after the closing bell. Earnings are expected to grow by 1.7 percent for the third quarter, based on results of S&P 500 companies so far and estimates, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue growth is expected at 2.7 percent. Of the 150 S&P companies reporting as of Tuesday morning, 75 percent beat earnings estimates and 59 percent have beaten revenue estimates. There is also international trade at 8:30 a.m. EDT, Services PMI at 9:45 a.m. and new home sales at 10 a.m. Patti DommCNBC Executive News Editor SHOW COMMENTS Please add a username to view or add comments Public Username for Commenting JOIN THE DISCUSSION To learn more about how we use your information, please read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

The S&P 500 dropped around 0.4 percent, with consumer discretionary falling 1.2 percent to lead decliners. The Nasdaq composite underperformed, falling about 0.6 percent.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermidMore By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slipped from two-week highs on Tuesday as results and forecasts from companies in sectors including housing and consumer products failed to live up to expectations. Apple , the largest U.S. company by market capitalization, posted after the bell better-than-expected iPhone sales that however continued a declining trend and shares fell about 2 percent, briefly dragging S&P 500 futures to session lows. During the regular session, Whirlpool , down 10.8 percent to $152.09, cited soft demand as it posted lower-than-expected earnings and gave an underwhelming forecast. Sherwin Williams' outlook also disappointed Wall Street and shares fell 10.9 percent to $247.61. Both were an indication to some analysts that the housing sector may be cooling. "Lackluster results from Whirlpool and Sherwin Williams may indicate a slowing in the housing cycle," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. She said those results could be weighing on Home Depot , which was down 3.5 percent at $123.34 as the largest points decliner on the S&P 500. Lowes Cos fell 3.5 percent to $68.47. Consumer products company Procter & Gamble rose 3.4 percent to $86.97 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, while sportswear maker Under Armour fell 13.2 percent to $32.89 after it reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. “We had a rally (Monday) and haven’t been able to sustain it, due to weaker-than-expected numbers from some names,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, calling the day’s earnings a "mixed bag." Overall, annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 percent, effectively putting an end to an earnings recession, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. Futures were also pressured after the bell by a late decline in oil prices after data showed a bigger-than-expected build in U.S. crude inventories. 3M fell 2.9 percent to $166.23 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. Caterpillar lost 1.8 percent after a downbeat forecast, while General Motors fell 4.2 percent amid fears regarding future profits. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.53-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and nine new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 67 new highs and 73 new lows. About 6.39 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, in line with the 6.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad US STOCKS-Wall St lower as earnings from some big names disappoint By Reuters Published: 12:55 EST, 25 October 2016 | Updated: 12:55 EST, 25 October 2016 e-mail By Tanya Agrawal Oct 25 (Reuters) - Disappointing corporate results from several heavyweights dragged down Wall Street as investors looked for clues regarding the timing of the next interest rate hike ahead of a Fed meeting next week. 3M fell 3 percent to $165.03 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. The stock was the biggest drag on the Dow. Whirlpool fell 10.5 percent to $152.60 after the home appliances maker's revenue took a hit from a strong dollar. The dollar index was little changed at 98.69 against a basket of major currencies, after hitting its highest level since early February. A strong dollar could dent the earnings of large multinationals. "We've had some mixed earnings today and the market right now is digesting earnings and positioning itself ahead of the Fed meeting next week," said Jeff Zipper, managing director for investments at Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank in Palm Beach, Florida. Annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 percent, following four quarters of contraction, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. "There is certainly some uncertainty around the election and the Fed and Brexit too," said Zipper. While investors aren't expecting the Fed to raise rates when it meets next week, they will be looking for clues regarding the trajectory of future hikes. Traders are pricing in a 74 percent chance for a December hike, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. At 12:44 p.m. ET (1644 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was down 48.21 points, or 0.26 percent, at 18,174.82, the S&P 500 was down 7.94 points, or 0.37 percent, at 2,143.39 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 28.71 points, or 0.54 percent, at 5,281.12. Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the materials index falling 0.98 percent. Sherwin-Williams fell 10 percent and weighed the most on the index. The consumer discretionary sector also fell 1.09 percent as poor results from Sherwin-Williams weighed on Home Depot. Home Depot weighed the most on the S&P.

Advertisement More stories                Tools Increase Text Decrease Text Reset Text Print Article The dollar rises to its highest level since early February, weighing on the earnings of multinationals. — Reuters file picNEW YORK, Oct 25 — Disappointing corporate results from several heavyweights dragged Wall Street as investors looked for clues regarding the timing of the next interest rate hike ahead of a Fed meeting next week. 3M fell 3.2 per cent to US$165.83 after the maker of Scotch tape and Post-it notes trimmed its full-year revenue and earnings forecasts for the second time. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P and Dow. Whirlpool fell 11.2 per cent to US$151.37 after the home appliances maker’s revenue took a hit from a strong dollar. The dollar index was up 0.26 per cent at 99.02 against a basket of major currencies, its highest level since early February. A strong dollar could dent the earnings of large multinationals. “We’ve had some mixed earnings today and the market right now is digesting earnings and positioning itself ahead of the Fed meeting next week,” said Jeff Zipper, managing director for investments at Private Client Reserve at US Bank in Palm Beach, Florida. Annualised third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 per cent, following four quarters of contraction, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 per cent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 per cent. “There is certainly some uncertainty around the election and the Fed and Brexit too,” said Zipper. While investors aren’t expecting the Fed to raise rates when it meets next week, they will be looking for clues regarding the trajectory of future hikes. Traders are pricing in a 74 per cent chance for a December hike, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. At 11:05am ET, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 32.12 points, or 0.18 per cent, at 18,190.91, the S&P 500 was down 6.02 points, or 0.28 per cent, at 2,145.31 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 17.97 points, or 0.34 per cent, at 5,291.86. Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the materials index’s 1.03 per cent fall leading the decliners. Sherwin-Williams fell 10 per cent and weighed the most on the index. The consumer discretionary sector also fell 0.94 per cent as poor results from Sherwin-Williams weighed on Home Depot and Lowe’s. Apple, which is scheduled to report results after the close of the bell, slipped 0.12 per cent to US$117.49. Procter & Gamble rose 4.5 per cent to US$87.89 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Oil prices nudged down, retreating from positive territory as traders digested comments from Opec states about the prospects of an output cut and ahead of US crude inventory data. Under Armour fell 13.9 per cent to US$32.58 after the sportswear maker reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,841 to 955. On the Nasdaq, 1,762 issues fell and 750 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 10 new 52-week highs and seven new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 48 new highs and 36 new lows. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Nepal PM phones India’s Modi over rupee chaos Google, Facebook cut ad revenue to ‘fake’ news sites European equities drift higher United to delay taking Boeing jets in US$4.8b savings push Macau sets US$25b gaming target for 2017 below estimates Oil slumps as prospect of Trump victory roils global markets Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Malaysia growth push stymied by banks cautious on loans US stocks decline after rally as election takes centre stage BNM: Ringgit fell against most world currencies in third quarter Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Groin-flashing frog discovered in Australia An in-depth look at Mazda’s SKYACTIV-G engine Reuters Video: Supermoon dazzles in Havana Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Related Articles US stocks mixed as Samsung announces US$8b Harman deal (VIDEO) Analysts say Trump stocks rally could persist All bullish in the end as US stocks post best week since 2014 US stocks halt rally spurred by election as Trump win assessed Dow hits record high as markets ride on Trump win Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

A drop in the price of oil below $50 a barrel, lingering uncertainty about the U.S. presidential election and growing expectations of a rate increase by the Federal Reserve, also contributed to the downbeat mood. The confidence of Americans in the U.S. economy fell in October to a three-month low just ahead of the Election Day showdown on Nov. 8 between Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and GOP nominee Donald Trump, with more consumers saying jobs are harder to find. See: Corporate insiders have lost appetite for their own stocks The S&P 500 SPX, +0.75%  declined by 8.17 points, or 0.4%, to 2,143.16, after being down nearly 10 points earlier. Nine of the 11 main sectors ended in the red. The consumer-discretionary closed off 1.2%, while materials lost 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.29%  declined 53.76 points, or 0.3%, at 18,169.27, as shares of Home Depot Inc. HD, -2.56%  weighed on blue-chips with a 3.2% decline. Earlier, the average had been down as many as 71 points. Shares of Dow component 3M Co. MMM, +0.77% fell 2.9% after reporting earnings that beat Wall Street expectations, but the St. Paul, Minn.-based company posted sales that were flat relative to the prior year and reduced the top end of its yearly earnings forecast. The share decline in Home Depot and 3M Co. wiped a combined 64 points from Dow industrials. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.10%  gave up 26.45 points, or 0.5%, to wrap at 5,283.40. Tuesday’s retreat in equities was to be expected as Monday’s gains were primarily the result of merger enthusiasm, said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Financial. “Deals tend to boost investor confidence especially after a dry spell,” Cavanaugh said. “So, we were just setting ourselves up for a bit of a letdown.” Market participants have been wrestling with third-quarter earnings that have outperformed lowered expectations, but a number of companies have cut their annual outlooks, which has raised questions about future earnings. Cavanaugh said the market is still focused on earnings and with about 30% of the S&P 500 having reported, chances are good that third-quarter earnings could end more than a year of quarterly earnings declines. Investors are eager to find out the results from two of the tech giants this week, with Apple reporting after the closing bell on Tuesday. Analysts expect to see Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.32%  report earnings at the high-end of its fourth-quarter forecast, aided by the iPhone 7 launch and new customers switching from Android after Samsung Electronics’ exploding Note 7 troubles. However, analysts are also projecting the third-straight quarterly decline in iPhone unit sales. Economic data: Consumer confidence dropped to 98.6 this month from 103.5 in September, the privately run Conference Board said Tuesday. The decline was well below Wall Street expectations. Separately, U.S. home prices rose in August, and were up 5.1% year-over-year as tight inventories continued to drive prices higher, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City index. Corporates: Shares in Whirlpool WHR, +1.44% dropped 11% after the appliance maker reported third-quarter profit and sales that missed expectations, and issued a downbeat outlook. Merck & Co. shares MRK, +0.19%  rose 2% after the drugmaker’s third-quarter earnings and sales came in above expectations. Chemicals maker DuPont& Co. DD, -0.62%  shares fell 0.7% despite the company raising its yearly profit forecast and better-than-expected quarterly earnings. The company is working on its merger with Dow Chemical Co. DOW, -0.54% Watch: Do lawsuits drive innovation in chemical industry? Procter & Gamble Co. PG, +0.75%  gained 3.4% after the consumer goods company reported earnings ahead of forecasts. Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, -0.49%  shares jumped 7.4% after the aerospace company posted higher-than-expected revenue and hiked its dividend. Baker Hughes Inc. BHI, +3.44%  shares rallied 4.3% after the oil-field services company reported a narrower-than-expected loss. General Motors Co. GM, +0.45% shares ended down 4.2% even as auto giant’s quarterly profit doubled. GM also posted higher revenue on strong U.S. truck sales. But it signaled continued weakness in Europe because of the fallout from the U.K.’s pending exit from the European Union, or Brexit. Freeport-McMoRan Inc. FCX, +0.50%  rallied 3.6% despite reporting profit and revenue that missed analysts’ expectations on Tuesday. Under Armour Inc.’s class A shares UA, +2.47% shares plunged 13.2% after the company issued a profit warning. ItThe decline came even as the athletic gear maker reported a 28% rise in third-quarter profit and an expansion of its market share, but those results were overshadowed by its warning. Nielsen Holdings PLC NLSN, +1.18%  shares dropped nearly 17% after the media-ratings company reported a slip in profit because of higher restructuring charges. Other markets: Oil futures CLZ6, -0.22%  settled down 1.1% at $49.96 a barrel while gold futures GCZ6, +0.31% settled up 0.8% at $1,273.60 an ounce. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.05%  tilted lower after an earlier gain. European stocks SXXP, +0.27%  pared earlier gains and were mostly lower and Asian shares were mixed following data that pointed to a slowdown for South Korea’s economy. —Carla Mozee in London contributed to this article.

The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P and Dow. Whirlpool fell 11.2 percent to $151.37 after the home appliances maker's revenue took a hit from a strong dollar. The dollar index was up 0.26 percent at 99.02 against a basket of major currencies, its highest level since early February. A strong dollar could dent the earnings of large multinationals. "We've had some mixed earnings today and the market right now is digesting earnings and positioning itself ahead of the Fed meeting next week," said Jeff Zipper, managing director for investments at Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank in Palm Beach, Florida. Annualized third-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 1.7 percent, following four quarters of contraction, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 150 companies that have reported so far, 75.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. "There is certainly some uncertainty around the election and the Fed and Brexit too," said Zipper. While investors aren't expecting the Fed to raise rates when it meets next week, they will be looking for clues regarding the trajectory of future hikes. Traders are pricing in a 74 percent chance for a December hike, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. At 11:05 a.m. ET (1505 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was down 32.12 points, or 0.18 percent, at 18,190.91, the S&P 500 was down 6.02 points, or 0.28 percent, at 2,145.31 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 17.97 points, or 0.34 percent, at 5,291.86. Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the materials index's 1.03 percent fall leading the decliners. Sherwin-Williams fell 10 percent and weighed the most on the index. The consumer discretionary sector also fell 0.94 percent as poor results from Sherwin-Williams weighed on Home Depot and Lowe's. Apple, which is scheduled to report results after the close of the bell, slipped 0.12 percent to $117.49. Procter & Gamble rose 4.5 percent to $87.89 after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Oil prices nudged down, retreating from positive territory as traders digested comments from OPEC states about the prospects of an output cut and ahead of U.S. crude inventory data. Under Armour fell 13.9 percent to $32.58 after the sportswear maker reported its slowest quarterly sales growth in six years. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,841 to 955. On the Nasdaq, 1,762 issues fell and 750 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 10 new 52-week highs and seven new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 48 new highs and 36 new lows.

Scott Gamm Oct 25, 2016 9:59 AM EDT U.S. stocks moved slightly higher early Tuesday as the markets awaited quarterly results from Apple (AAPL) , which are due after the markets close. Apple is expected to report earnings of $1.65 a share, compared to $1.96 during the same quarter a year ago. Revenue of $46.9 billion is expected; down from $51.5 billion a year ago. Analysts are still bullish on Apple's stock. Under Armour (UA) shares sunk by roughly 15% after the company said its gross margin dropped to 47.5% in third quarter, compared to 48.8% in the same quarter in 2015. For its third quarter, the company topped Wall Street's estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Procter & Gamble (PG) reported earnings of $1.03 a share for its most recent quarter, eclipsing forecasts of $0.98. Revenue was unchanged year-over-year and met analysts' expectations. China sales grew 2% and the company said UK sales were "challenging" amid its pending exit from the European Union.

Doc: If the Cubs win the series, who are Cubs fans? The Morning Line Paul Daugherty , pdaugherty@enquirer.com 1:06 p.m. EDT October 25, 2016 455 Shares Cubs relief pitcher Aroldis Chapman delivers to the plate in the eighth inning.  (Photo: Kareem Elgazzar) The Series of the Cubs is upon us. It can’t be helped. Apparently, another team from another town is playing, too. Cleveland, I think. No matter. The Indians might as well be wooden. They are props for this grand Cubbies performance, filled with the pathos of 108 seasons. Between now and whenever the Cubs Win Cubs Win Cubs Win, all we will hear about is the pain of the Cubs fan. He has the market cornered on fanly pain. Just ask him. But as was pointed out elsewhere, unless you’re 108, why is your pain any greater than anyone else’s? Why is your pain romanticized, celebrated and unique, and ours is not? Sports fans are born to suffer and anguish and die by degrees. Did your team lose to Pittsburgh in the playoffs last year? Did your team have its best player on the best team in the land break his leg just before the national postseason? Well, did it? If you’re a youngster, you’ve actually known joy. (I know that sucks, but try to cope.) Since ’98, the Cubs have made the postseason six times. That’s three times more than the Reds have been there. Your “field’’ once a quaint spot for the young and the unemployed to get dreamily blasted in the afternoon, is just like everyone else’s place now. The rooftops have been monetized, the scoreboard obscures views. The team and the neighborhood have clashed over whose rights have been violated. A story: In 1989, when the Cubs were playing the Giants in the playoffs, I stood in front of the light brown, 3- or 4-story apartment building just across Waveland Avenue from Wrigley. I wanted to talk to someone who lived there, about what it was like to watch ballgames for free, from the comfort of his living room. I got there at 10, four hours before the game. As great luck would have it, a guy walked by. He had, as I recall, the apartment on the third floor facing leftfield. A 2-bedroom for which he paid all of $750 a month. He asked me in. Guy had a bay window overlooking Wrigley. All that one could not see from there was the warning track, from the LF line to left-center. The location was closer than the red seats at Riverfront Stadium. His landlord allowed him two guests on the roof for every game, free of charge. We went to the roof, through one of those trapdoors you see in old apartment buildings (My son in Brooklyn has one at his place now). The roof was nothing special, gravel stuck together with tar. Flat. I think there were a couple folding picnic chairs. It was magical. This was a team one could love forever. Now? You see now. Now, the rooftops are grotesque and a tribute to the almighty dollar. Charm departed with the addition of that first bleacher. This is not Tom Browning’s rooftop. And never will be again. So let’s skip all the cute Cubbies crapola, shall we? Then there is this: What happens when they win? And they will. The Cubs have the best team in the world. Great starting pitching, Chappy hammering in the 9th (or whenever), Bryant, Rizzo and the emerging greatness of Baez. Seasoned October manager. When they break the drought of 108 years, when they can no longer attract your pity, who are the Cubs then? Just another Red Sox, awash in money, contending every year in their erstwhile “friendly confines." As easy to dislike as ants at a picnic. For a century, CubsFans have not only wallowed in their misery. They’ve embraced it. Look at us, we’re noble. The notion that half of them these days are fans of the Cubs because it’s a cool thing to do is irrelevant. Here we are, loyal despite the heartbreak. You think you’re a fan? One-zero-eight, dude. Losing defines them. Wait 'til next year is absolutely who they are. In a fortnight, it won’t be. They’ll be just another big-market club gobbling free agents, predicted to be good every year after year. Do they want that? Here’s what a 38-year-old CubsGuy named Raymond Fuller told the NYTimes: “I’m scared,” he said. “My entire life, the Cubs have never been able to do this. If the Cubs end up winning the World Series, what it means to be a Cubs fan is going to change, and, I confess, I’m not certain it is something to be valued. The moniker ‘lovable loser’ — I hate it, but it means something. It’s shared hope and disappointment. It means accepting loss and trying your best and not coming out on top.” Be careful what you wish for, CubsFan. Starting tonight, you’re gonna be no more special than the Yankees, Red Sox, Dodgers, etc. Just another spoiled elitist, hoping to get a corporate invite to a rooftop view. Now, then... Here’s the crux of an op-ed piece that appeared in the TM this week, re UC’s snub by the Big 12, written by a UC librarian and a professor at the Blue Ash campus: After accounting for all the revenue, the UC athletic department loses more than $20 million a year. Donations to the UC athletics program remain flat. It is a subsidy, not an investment The University of Cincinnati is at a fork in the road. The failure of UC’s effort to be admitted into the Big 12 actually presents a great opportunity – an opportunity to realign its priorities and focus on the core teaching and research missions Athletic department spending is costing each student over $600 a year, In 2010, UC did a survey of students and found that spending on athletics was last on their list of priorities, while first was academics. Yet, between 2005 and 2014, the athletics subsidy soared 380 percent. Meanwhile, UC’s academic spending per student has declined 19 percent since 2008. And despite the recent enrollment growth, the university has cut its full-time faculty by 6.9 percent since 2008. This is the same argument some applied to public funding of stadia. It’s hard to argue, except this: Is Cincinnati a better place because of what has occurred on The Banks? Is downtown better for the redoing of Fort Washington Way? Undoubtedly. Like sports or not, they contribute to a place’s overall well being. Do we think Cincinnati could attract young, skilled, creative types without what has happened in Over-the-Rhine the past several years? If FWW remained the mess it was 20 years ago, would P&G attract the sort of talent to its headquarters that it needs to thrive? Of course, UC’s athletic budget seems bloated. But compared to what? Of course the makeovers of Nippert and 5/3 Arena are costly. But each needed the facelift, especially Nip. That would have been true if UC were chasing the Big 12 or moving to the MAC. The point of the piece is well taken. But the role of big-time athletics should not be so casually dismissed. ON A WHOLLY DIFFERENT TOPIC... The NYTimes writes about the expense and pain of tattoo removal. The Erstwhile Kid Down the Hall has four tats. I think. Yeah, four. Two are big, two aren’t. I’m not crazy about ‘em but hey, it ain’t my body. I do wonder, though, if in 20 years (or 10 or 30) my currently 30-year-old progeny will want at least a couple removed. I don’t know anyone who’s the same person at 50 he was at 30. What’s fashionable today certainly won’t be tomorrow. So... Who of youse Mobsters has tat remorse? What have you done about it? A CRY FOR HELP, MOBSTERS! I am headed Thursday to London. I have never been to London. I, in fact, have never had a desire to go to London, even as I love traveling Over There. Dublin, Paris, Innsbruck, Salzburg, Munich, Lucerne, Bern etc., etc. All I really want to do in London is find Abbey Road and take a walk in a white suit. Anyway I am seeking the out of the way, not terribly touristy and even borderline weird London that the locals love. Neighborhood, monument, museum, record store. Whatever. Anybody been there who has that sort of knowledge? Lemme know. 10 REASONS YOU’RE NOT WATCHING AS MUCH NFL, from SI.com. Here’s one that’s not on the list: It just ain’t that compelling. Frequent perusers of This Space have heard this from me for several years. The hype exceeds the reality. Bad games, too frequently interrupted by ads and replay reviews. The similar ways every team does things. The self-seriousness the league projects. The melodrama. And so on. The NFL is overly full of itself. Its product doesn’t warrant that. I’m gonna watch Titans-Jaguars on a Thursday night? Not in this lifetime. TUNE O’ THE DAY. In honor of the London junket, a tune from a band that was occasionally brilliant. Such as here.

Asian stocks were mixed on Tuesday as upbeat reports on manufacturing in the U.S. and Europe were followed by weak growth data from South Korea, Asia's fourth-largest economy. (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........SEOUL, South Korea — Global stocks mostly rose Tuesday amid upbeat economic reports and relatively strong corporate earnings. KEEPING SCORE: Britain’s FTSE 100 added 0.4 percent to 7,015 while France’s CAC 40 gained 0.1 percent to 4,555. Germany’s DAX rose 0.3 percent to 10,795. Stock futures showed that Wall Street was set for a tepid start. Dow and S&P futures advanced 0.1 percent each. BUSINESS IN U.S., EUROPE: A survey of business confidence in Germany rose in October, suggesting the country’s economy is shrugging off any concerns about Britain’s EU exit or shaky banks. Earlier, a separate survey of U.S. manufacturing climbed to its highest level in a year, while an index of business activity in the euro rose in October to its highest so far this year. ANALYST’S TAKE: “On the data front, manufacturing readings improved for the U.S., Japan and Europe,” analysts from Mizuho Bank said in a daily commentary. “This continues to point to ongoing recovery in G3 economies though at a modest pace.” SLOWING KOREA: South Korea’s reports were less upbeat, with third-quarter growth slowing to 2.7 percent, its weakest annual pace in more than a year. Manufacturing saw its largest decline in over five years thanks to Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 recalls and a strike at Hyundai Motors. “Korea’s economy lost momentum in the third quarter of 2016, and we expect growth will struggle in the coming quarters due to a combination of rising domestic headwinds and subdued global demand,” Krystal Tan of Capital Economics said in a commentary.

On Tuesday, the focus will be on reports due from, among others, Apple, Caterpillar, Procter & Gamble, and AT&T, whose figures will be scrutinized in the context of its massive deal to take over Time Warner. ASIA’S DAY: Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.8 percent to 17,365.25 while South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.5 percent to 2,037.17. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dipped 0.2 percent to 23,565.11 and the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.1 percent to 3,131.94. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.6 percent to 5,442.80. Markets in Southeast Asia were mixed. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude added 21 cents to $50.73 per barrel in New York. The contract closed 33 cents lower on Monday. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 12 cents to $51.58 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 104.54 yen from 104.30 yen. The euro strengthened to $1.0881 from $1.0875.

KEEPING SCORE: Britain’s FTSE 100 added 0.4 per cent to 7,015 while France’s CAC 40 gained 0.1 per cent to 4,555. Germany’s DAX rose 0.3 per cent to 10,795. Stock futures showed that Wall Street was set for a tepid start. Dow and S&P futures advanced 0.1 per cent each. BUSINESS IN U.S., EUROPE: A survey of business confidence in Germany rose in October, suggesting the country’s economy is shrugging off any concerns about Britain’s EU exit or shaky banks. Earlier, a separate survey of U.S. manufacturing climbed to its highest level in a year, while an index of business activity in the euro rose in October to its highest so far this year. ANALYST’S TAKE: “On the data front, manufacturing readings improved for the U.S., Japan and Europe,” analysts from Mizuho Bank said in a daily commentary. “This continues to point to ongoing recovery in G3 economies though at a modest pace.” SLOWING KOREA: South Korea’s reports were less upbeat, with third-quarter growth slowing to 2.7 per cent, its weakest annual pace in more than a year. Manufacturing saw its largest decline in over five years thanks to Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 recalls and a strike at Hyundai Motors. “Korea’s economy lost momentum in the third quarter of 2016, and we expect growth will struggle in the coming quarters due to a combination of rising domestic headwinds and subdued global demand,” Krystal Tan of Capital Economics said in a commentary. EARNINGS WATCH: Company earnings have so far been relatively strong. On Tuesday, the focus will be on reports due from, among others, Apple, Caterpillar, Procter & Gamble, and AT&T, whose figures will be scrutinized in the context of its massive deal to take over Time Warner. ASIA’S DAY: Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.8 per cent to 17,365.25 while South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.5 per cent to 2,037.17. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dipped 0.2 per cent to 23,565.11 and the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.1 per cent to 3,131.94. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.6 per cent to 5,442.80. Markets in Southeast Asia were mixed. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude added 21 cents to $50.73 per barrel in New York. The contract closed 33 cents lower on Monday. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 12 cents to $51.58 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 104.54 yen from 104.30 yen. The euro strengthened to $1.0881 from $1.0875. © Copyright Times Colonist Email to a Friend Your Email Address: * Your Name: * To Email Address: * Message: * * Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.

Oil prices inched higher in European trade after Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak emphasized that there is an urgent need to rebalance the oil market. Base metal prices are also rising and gold futures edged up after settling lower on Monday, even as the dollar remained strong across the board. China's offshore yuan hit a record low, but Yi Gang, Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China, said the currency will remain broadly stable versus other emerging market currencies. The day's economic calendar remains relatively light, with the FHFA house price index for August, the S&P Case-Shiller house price index for August and the consumer confidence index for October slated for release later in the session. Investors also await speeches from Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi for further clues as to the future direction of monetary policy. It's a big day for earnings, with Apple, General Motors, 3M, Caterpillar, Sprint, Fiat Chrysler, DuPont, Merck, United Technologies and Procter & Gamble all set to unveil their earnings cards later in the day. Meanwhile, Visa Inc. (V) beat fiscal fourth-quarter forecasts after the closing bell Monday as customers spent more using the network. Twitter Inc. (TWTR) is planning widespread job cuts, to be announced as soon as this week, the Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL, GOOG) Google has acquired Eyefluence, which is working to enable eye movements to control digital screens.

Oil prices inched higher in European trade after Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak emphasized that there is an urgent need to rebalance the oil market. Base metal prices are also rising and gold futures edged up after settling lower on Monday, even as the dollar remained strong across the board. China's offshore yuan hit a record low, but Yi Gang, Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China, said the currency will remain broadly stable versus other emerging market currencies. The day's economic calendar remains relatively light, with the FHFA house price index for August, the S&P Case-Shiller house price index for August and the consumer confidence index for October slated for release later in the session. Investors also await speeches from Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi for further clues as to the future direction of monetary policy. It's a big day for earnings, with Apple, General Motors, 3M, Caterpillar, Sprint, Fiat Chrysler, DuPont, Merck, United Technologies and Procter & Gamble all set to unveil their earnings cards later in the day. Meanwhile, Visa Inc. (V) beat fiscal fourth-quarter forecasts after the closing bell Monday as customers spent more using the network. Twitter Inc. (TWTR) is planning widespread job cuts, to be announced as soon as this week, the Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL, GOOG) Google has acquired Eyefluence, which is working to enable eye movements to control digital screens.

By Mark Gilger Jr. / Published: October 25, 2016 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     DAVID MCKEOWN/STAFF PHOTO Bill Reichert, left, Schuylkill Headwaters Association president, accepts a proclamation Wednesday from the Schuylkill County commissioners, from left, Chairman George F. Halcovage Jr., Frank J. Staudenmeier and Gary Hess, for receiving the Partnership Award at the Schuylkill County Courthouse. Reichert was honored at the 26th annual Evening for Northeast Pennsylvania’s Environment Banquet in Wilkes-Barre. The Schuylkill County commissioners recognized William E. Reichert, president of Schuylkill Headwaters Association, on Wednesday for leading the water quality improvement efforts in the Schuylkill River watershed. Reichert was one of several people to receive the Partnership Award on Thursday at the 26th annual Evening for Northeast Pennsylvania’s Environment Banquet at the Woodlands Inn and Resort, Wilkes-Barre. “I’m not a fan of personal accolades like this,” Reichert said. “None of the work that I have done could have been achieved without so many people.” Reichert said that includes the county commissioners, conservation district, the state Department of Environmental Protection and other organizations involved in the watershed. “A whole bunch of people play into our work,” Reichert said. “I am happy to take this award, but it is an award for all our efforts.” Founded in 1998, the Schuylkill Headwaters Association is a nonprofit organization with the mission “to promote the environmental integrity of the Schuylkill River, its tributaries and the watershed that lies within the boundaries of Schuylkill County,” according to the organization’s website www.schuylkillheadwaters.org. Schuylkill Headwaters Association works to protect and enhance the headwaters of the Schuylkill River by educating residents about the Schuylkill River and implementing projects to reduce and control pollution. There are various sources of water pollution within the headwaters of the Schuylkill River, but the main impairment is abandoned mine drainage. Commissioner Chairman George F. Halcovage read the proclamation. He said that Reichert “is a champion for improving the quality of water within the northernmost reaches of the Schuylkill River watershed” and his “practical approach to rejects, mentoring of young volunteers and incredible humility has made him a well-respected conservation leader in Schuylkill County and beyond.” “Having a business along the Schuylkill River, I have seen the changes over the last 37 years,” Commissioner Gary J. Hess said. “It is about building partnerships and you were in the front pulling those together.” “Bill is the prime example of being a good steward for our environment,” Commissioner Frank J. Staudenmeier said. “As Bill had said, it takes many people to do it, but it takes leadership and we appreciate it, Bill.” The Northeast Environmental Partners consists of the Northeastern Pennsylvania Alliance, state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, state Department of Environmental Protection, Pennsylvania Environmental Council’s Northeast Office, PPL Corp., Procter and Gamble Paper Products Co., and Wilkes University. The regional Environmental Partnership Awards program pays tribute to those organizations and individuals of Northeastern Pennsylvania that have achieved environmental protection or conservation through partnering with others, according to the organization’s website at www.pecpa.org. In addition to Reichert, the other recipients of the 26th annual Environmental Partnership Awards include Buzzi Unicem, USA Stockertown Plant, Northampton County; Lehman Sanctuary, Luzerne County; Richard Mitchell, Luzerne County; Tom Ogorzalek, Luzerne County; Tobyhanna Conservation Association, Monroe County.

"From my perspective, this is the heart of earnings season. How earnings trends are developing is top of my mind," said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas. "The market wants to see the good earnings data is not just about financials," he said. Apple, the largest S&P 500 stock by market capitalization, is the highlight of Tuesday's earnings reports. Analysts polled by Reuters on average expect the iPhone maker to report earnings of $1.65 a share on revenue of $46.89 billion for the quarter. "Tech is the largest sector in terms of an earnings weight," Lefkowitz said. "Getting a better handle on trends there is going to be important. We've seen some weakness in industrials. [We] want to see how broad-based that is." The Nasdaq 100 closed Monday at a record high of 4,909.97 after hitting an all-time intraday high of 4,911.59, helped by gains in Microsoft, Amazon.com, Apple and Alphabet, Google's parent company. show chapters <p>A-list tech earnings on deck</p> <p>Paul Meeks, tech investor, and John Traynor, People&rsquo;s United Wealth Management CIO, give their views on upcoming tech earnings from Apple, Amazon and Alphabet.</p> A-list tech earnings on deck    Monday, 24 Oct 2016 | 2:51 PM ET | 02:28 Tech led the S&P 500 higher, which closed up 10 points at 2,151. The broad index gains were helped by more than $100 billion in corporate deals, including AT&T's more than $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner, announced heading into Monday's trading session. The major banks set a positive tone to earnings season with better-than-expected third-quarter results, helped by a surge in revenue from bond trading. The majority of S&P 500 names have yet to report, with about one-third of the index posting results this week. "I hope what the market's signaling or finding out [is the] earnings recession doesn't exist or never really existed," said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management. Quarterly earnings per share have declined for four straight quarters as a sharp plunge in oil prices along with a strong dollar weighed heavily on corporate profits. If all remaining companies report earnings that match estimates, earnings per share will return to growth this quarter, up 1.1 percent from the third quarter last year, according to Monday's Thomson Reuters data. Other earnings reports due ahead of Tuesday's open include DuPont, Eli Lilly, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Merck, Novartis, Procter & Gamble, United Technologies, Corning, Freeport-McMoRan, KeyCorp, KKR, Lockheed Martin, Pentair, Sherwin-Williams, Sprint, TD Ameritrade, Under Armour, Valero Energy, Whirlpool, AK Steel, II-VI, Janus, JetBlue, Spirit Airlines and TransUnion. Firms set to post quarterly results after the close include Chipotle Mexican Grill, Capital One, Discover Financial, Edwards Lifesciences, Express Scripts, Juniper Networks, Vertex Pharma, iRobot, Pandora Media, Panera Bread and Owens-Illinois. Among the few pieces of minor economic data scheduled for release Tuesday are August home price indexes from S&P Case-Shiller and the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Consumer confidence for October is scheduled for release later in the morning from The Conference Board. Analysts expect the index to tick down to 101.5 from 104.1 in September, according to a consensus estimate from Reuters. The Richmond Fed survey is also due Tuesday morning. Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart is scheduled to speak at 1:20 p.m. ET on lending and investing in community development. Fed speakers will then be in a quiet period ahead of the central bank's meeting next week. The Treasury is set to hold a two-year note auction in the afternoon. Treasury yields rose Monday, with the two-year yield near 0.84 percent in late trade and the 10-year yield around 1.76 percent following an encouraging pickup in the October flash U.S. Markit manufacturing PMI. The U.S. dollar index was little changed in late trade Monday after hitting intraday 97.188, its highest since February 3. The euro was around $1.088. "For now, everything depends on the election," said Athanasios Vamvakidis, head of G-10 FX strategy in Europe at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. If Hillary Clinton wins the U.S. presidential election and federal government gridlock continues with a Republican-dominated Congress, Vamvakidis said the last leg of the dollar rally will come around December, when the Fed likely raises rates and the European Central Bank probably extends its asset purchase program. The euro dollar is near his year-end target of $1.08. Overseas on Tuesday, ECB President Mario Draghi is set to speak in Berlin on "Stability, Equity and Monetary Policy."

Published on October 24, 2016. Marketers will especially appreciate the improvements seen in The Wearality Sky VR headset, David Berkowitz writes. Credit: Wearality Most Popular After attending a conference about making virtual media come alive in a city that is virtually non-existent on Western maps, the future of an emerging field has never felt so real to me. Perhaps I had watched too many X-Men movies on China Southern Airlines, but attending the Virtual Reality Summit in Gui'An, China, on October 8 felt reminiscent of those scenes where Professor Charles Xavier rolls his wheelchair into Cerebro and tracks down mutants all over the world. If you're in New York or Silicon Valley, or in Austin or Raleigh, you might have some sense of the activity going on outside of your immediate surroundings. But flying halfway around the world to a part of China so remote that it is literally not on the map (seriously, try searching for "Gui'An" or "Guian" in Google Maps), one can appreciate just how many "mutants" are gathering in disparate locations to learn from each other and collaborate. These networks keep growing. One of the hosts of the conference, ARinChina, brought me over along with a group of about a half-dozen Westerners. This media company connects a community of 60,000 developers, all of whom are invested in staying ahead of breakthrough technologies like virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and the hybrid known as mixed reality (MR). The AR track where I presented was hosted by RAVV, a new technology think tank that is pulling together subject matter experts across robotics, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, VR and AR. RAVV is building an international ecosystem that includes its own approaches for startup incubation, knowledge sharing and other collaborative endeavors. I'm not being hyperbolic or even envoking the Chinese tradition of saving face when I say it was a humbling experience. I felt like a dwarf among giants. If this was a tech conference version of the X-Men, I was looking around and meeting Storm, Mystique and (fittingly for VR) Cyclops. Me? I was the extra whose superpower was using chopsticks for a meal without spilling anything on himself. Here are a few observations from the conference, including discussions held during the weekend of tours and demonstrations in Gui'An: AR works best when it's invisible. This was the theme of my talk, and it was a constant, implicit refrain throughout the summit. Consider Snapchat Lenses and Pokémon Go. People use these apps because they're fun, and odds are the vast majority have no clue that AR is involved. B2B will be a major driver of AR and MR. You know who most appreciates head-mounted displays? Professionals who work with their hands, need content delivered directly in front of them, and don't care about how they look. What's likely is that a lot of companies will initially invest in these technologies and related content to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and save costs. More consumer-friendly applications will follow. Imagine empowering people to enhance their skills at various jobs, from basic home and car repair, to cooking, to DIY projects. Brands must constantly hone their value proposition. I was having a discussion with a presenter about the viability of some ideas for brands, and the brand name Procter and Gamble came up. I said it was unlikely people will take out their phones in the grocery store and try out some AR experience, scanning around to find the best kind of laundry detergent. But if a brand created an app that could use the camera to recognize stains and tell people how to clean them, any parent with young children at home would love it. Some of the most important technical specifications are about the optics. The quality of the lenses makes a tremendous difference when using any kind of headset. I got to try the new VR viewer from Wearality, a company run by optics pioneer David A. Smith. The crispness of the screen, along with the breadth of the field of view, delivers a breakthrough in quality, especially for any device at a sub-$100 price point. Marketers will be especially appreciative of improvements here, as they'll then be able to ensure consumers appreciate the investment they make in producing content for these new media. It takes a village, and a country, and a world. The goal of the Virtual Reality Summit wasn't just to show off cool gadgetry, though that was part of it. It was to pull together support for business development, content creation, financing, manufacturing, infrastructure, and hardware and software innovation. These are topics of interest for Gui'An in particular, which has quickly become China's big data capital. But they are also topics for everyone investing their time, money, and energy in these fields. To get a sense of how global the emerging mixed reality field is, consider that, in February, China's e-commerce giant Alibaba led the $800 million Series C round for Florida-based Magic Leap, an MR startup. As our daily reality becomes more virtual and augmented, it doesn't matter where someone is on the map. This field is connecting far-flung practitioners, hinting at a time, soon, when AR, VR and MR will connect people in ways never before possible.

Consumer goods companies have been grappling with slowing volume sales over the past year, hit by falling household spending across the world, fierce competition from retailers’ own-brand products and economic weakness in emerging markets. The pound’s plunge since the June Brexit vote has put extra pressure on firms like Unilever, whose brands include Marmite yeast spread and Dove soap, by driving up the cost of their imports to Britain and dollar-traded commodities. Last week the Anglo-Dutch company tried to raise the prices of a range of products by 10 per cent in Britain, prompting a stand-off with the country’s largest supermarket, Tesco, which balked at the demand. The dispute — which showed an early effect of Britain’s decision to leave the EU — was quickly resolved, but gave the public a rare glimpse into the difficult discussions that industry sources say are happening across the sector. An executive at one of Unilever’s main rivals said it was also discussing possible price increases with UK supermarkets. A source at another rival said it faced the same pressures as Unilever but that it was not yet ready to raise prices and first wanted to exhaust cost-cutting options. The Unilever row illustrated how reliant the company is on price rises — rather than increased volume sales — to make more money from shoppers around the world and how difficult that strategy may be to keep up, even as volatile currency and commodity environments drive up costs. The day “Marmitegate” dominated the front pages of British newspapers, the company reported a 3.2 per cent rise in quarterly sales — with a 0.4 per cent drop in the number of goods sold comfortably offset by a 3.6 per cent increase in prices. It is not alone among its peers in this trend of slowing volumes and rising prices. This could put the sector on course for a long battle with big retailers like British supermarkets, which conversely need high sales volumes because of their tight margins and fixed costs, and low prices due to fierce competition in the domestic market. How this conflict might play out is unclear, with the Tesco row perhaps just a taste of what is to come. French food group Danone, which makes Activia yoghurt and Aptamil baby formula, reported a 0.7 per cent fall in third-quarter volumes this week but, like Unilever, used price increases to drive a 2.1 per cent rise in sales. Britain’s Reckitt Benckiser’s, which does not break down its sales by volumes and price rises, reported its weakest quarterly growth in over five years on Wednesday. Nestle also posted its weakest sales growth in more than a decade on Thursday, with volumes slowing. Procter & Gamble reports results this week. Unilever, Reckitt and P&G all declined to comment on any future plans for price increases, while Danone did not respond to a request for comment. WHY UNILEVER?: Unilever is the No 1 supplier of ice cream, deodorants, bath and shower products and margarines and spreads in many countries, and has invested in marketing and brand innovation over the years, which gives it pricing power. But industry experts said the company’s request for 10 per cent price rises in Britain was aggressive, and that they did not expect its rivals to demand such high increases. “We think all UK food producers are going to need price increases in the next few months but we can’t see 10 per cent,” said Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo. “Unilever’s pricing strategy does seem to be about as aggressive as it could be.” Unilever said its reliance on price increases was largely down to factors including weak consumer demand in emerging markets and the sharp devaluation of Latin American currencies. It is more exposed to these regions than most of its peers. Emerging markets as a whole account for almost 60 per cent of its sales, with Latin America generating 16 per cent of sales. Much of the company’s third-quarter price rises were to offset currency devaluations in Latin America. It said currency swings globally had made its commodity costs 600 million euros ($659.5 million) more expensive this year, with a large part of that coming from Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Youth annual art exhibition opens today Fleeing Brexit to Berlin?
