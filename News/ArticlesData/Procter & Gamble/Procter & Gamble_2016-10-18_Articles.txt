Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Oct 18, 2016 at 3:36PM Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) investors are feeling optimistic for a change. Its stock is up 14% in 2016, which puts the consumer goods giant in the top third of all Dow stocks in year-to-date performance. That rally puts pressure on P&G to show real business progress when it posts quarterly results on Tuesday, Oct. 25. Here's what investors will want to see from the company next week. Sales growth P&G has encouraging momentum heading into the first quarterly report of its new fiscal year. Organic sales improved to a 2% expansion pace last quarter from 1% the prior quarter and 0% over the prior six months.  Image source: P&G investor presentation. In addition, the recent gains were powered by higher sales volume, and not just increased prices, which is good news because it implies healthier, more balanced growth. With volumes rising across its portfolio, P&G is poised to end its market share slide after two years of below-average growth. Yet that rebound might be held back by a weakening industry. Rival Unilever (NYSE:UL) just posted a rare volume decline as its expansion pace worsened to 3% from 5%. Executives said that demand for consumer products around the world "slowed further" from its already soft pace. That's why investors will be eager to hear from P&G CEO David Taylor about how the company is navigating that slump, along with an update on what it might mean for the company's forecast of 2% overall organic growth in fiscal 2017. Margin expansion P&G's business is supposed to produce consistently strong earnings growth of around 8% each year. Yet the company has fallen far short of that aim lately. In each of the last two fiscal years, in fact, core earnings fell 2%.  Image source: Getty Images. The company in early August projected a return to form in fiscal 2017, with core earnings rising by about 6%. A major contributor to that goal will be ramped up cost cuts. P&G squeezed $1.4 billion per year out of its expense structure lately by reducing overhead and improving efficiencies throughout its supply chain. Executives aren't resting on that success, though, and plan to boost savings to a $2 billion annual pace over the next five years. Cutting against those gains will be increased spending on things like marketing and innovation research. P&G is ramping up advertising support for its biggest brands while pouring cash into sampling programs that get trial versions of products like the Gillette razor blade into millions of consumers' hands every year. Management believes that savings from cost cuts will be enough to fund this extra commitment, while still producing earnings of about $3.85 per share this year -- up from $3.67 per share in fiscal 2016. Cash generation and returns Even as operating results disappoint, cash flow has been a key bright spot for P&G shareholders. The company produced over $15 billion of operating cash last year, and free cash amounted to well over 100% of earnings, beating the company's long-term target of at least 90% cash flow productivity.  Besides demonstrating the strength of its business model, rising cash flow is important because it directly impacts shareholder returns. P&G plans to deliver a huge portion of its market capitalization to its investors through stock buybacks and dividends over the next few years ($22 billion in fiscal 2017 alone), so its cash generation will be critical to watch. If gains in this area are strong, the company will be able to goose investor returns by dramatically lowering its share count while hiking its dividend. If not, income investors will likely be disappointed by another weak dividend raise this year following 2016's tiny 1% uptick. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos has no position in any stocks mentioned.

MARKETING Stop Spending Tens of Thousands on This Ineffective Marketing Tool Press releases are contrived and hideous. Stop writing them. By Nicole Volpe Miller Nicole is the Chief Operating Officer of Deke Digital, working with financial services and healthcare executives to create and distribute expert commentary on major media platforms. @nicolevolpe Chief Operating Officer, Deke Digital@nicolevolpe WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement If you are writing press releases, and you are not a company the size of Apple or Procter & Gamble, you need to stop. Now. To journalists, press releases are annoying. The format is lawyerly. The quotes are made up. They are full of jargon, and totally self-serving. They are written to bury any negatives. No one ever fails or is fired or acquired. In press releases, companies always have successful quarters, and executives always step down to spend time with their families, and companies merge as equals. By sending press releases with such logic bombs in them, you are not giving journalists information. You are giving them work to do; a riddle to be worked out. Their editor is standing over them asking: Okay, what really happened? And if you do not have, say, over $250 million in annual revenue, there simply are not enough journalists left in newsrooms to bother to try to detangle that riddle. Newsrooms are at half the staff they were in the mid-90s. Even if a reporter is initially fooled by your sunny release on, say, your poor quarterly performance, where you bury the actual net loss number and put forward some other metric that sounds like you made money, you have essentially forced a correction on that reporter. Nothing hurts a journalist more than that. Just Tell Your Story There are so many other ways to get your story across, and told in a format that's more straightforward or conversational. The Securities and Exchange Commission in 2013 ruled that social media can be used to disseminate material information about your company. Or you could use your own website. Or check out self-publishing platform Medium as a place where you can tell your story, for free, without being constrained by the press release format. Why not just tell your story in some format that fits your style? There are lots of examples of people who get this right: Warren Buffett has been writing his letter to shareholders each year since the 1970s. Marc Andreessen gets his ideas out in tweetstorms. Techstars founder Brad Feld has his FeldThoughts blog. Mary Meeker can pack an entire universe of data and ideas into her yearly Internet reports. The press release industry is in as tight a spot as the news business. They are only surviving because the press release is a habit that executives and marketers have not yet reconsidered closely enough to break. If you have something to announce, the reflex is to "issue a release." This despite that it's potentially costing you tens of thousands per year to distribute these press releases, on top of what you are paying people skilled in writing in the format. This made sense pre-Internet, when your release would automatically print out on dot-matrix printers stationed in the heart of each newsroom. But now, not so much. Put It To The Test Here is the test: Who picks up your releases and actually writes an article? If you are getting picked up by journalists writing a full article, and calling you for additional information and quotes, then by all means, proceed. But that is extremely rare for companies that are not the very biggest in their sector. Beware of people who justify your press release spend by pointing out that the press release itself is being carried on various sites--Marketwatch, AOL Finance, etc. So what? The traffic to press release pages on those sites is extremely low. In fact, it used to be that press releases were important enough in the news economy that sites like Yahoo Finance would pay for them. Then executives at those portals looked at their traffic numbers and saw that next to no one was clicking on them. When the Yahoo Finances of the world told the PR distribution companies of the world they wouldn't pay them anymore, the press release distribution companies offered them for free to the portals. At that point, financial news portals started to realize that they still didn't want to carry content that was uninteresting to its readers. And then the press release distribution companies instead offered to pay to have them run. Why would they pay to have them run? Because the head of marketing at the firm that posted the press release would be able to see that the press release was live on the financial news portals, and show that to their CEO as proof they had done their job. The problem is that the CEO and the head of marketing were perhaps the only people to ever click on that link. The question is: Do you want to pay for that?

Jim Cramer rang the lightning round bell, which means he gave his take on caller favorite stocks at rapid speed: Procter & Gamble: "I like Procter. I'd like you to buy it a little bit cheaper, because I think it can come down to $84 or $85. But I think it's a good choice." Synchrony Financial: "That thing has come down too much. That's kind of attractive to me ... You know what's more attractive? If Visa sells off a couple of bucks. My charitable trust owns it. I think that Charlie Scharf [outgoing CEO] has got some personal things he has to attend to at home in New York, and that stock is coming down and that may be a better opportunity." Petrobras: "It has made a big comeback because the real has gotten very strong. Petrobras, I don't know. This is a play on the real, and the real is good but I think I don't want to overstay my welcome. I would be tempted to cash in on half." Bristol-Myers Squibb: "Candidly, I was disappointed with the study that just came out. I thought that Opdivo had more opportunities to do it ... I do not expect anything good near-term for Bristol-Myers. That was just a disappointing study." CIT Group: "Why don't you focus on Citi? My charitable trust owns Citi, that was the best quarter so far. I would be in Citi. JPMorgan was a great quarter, don't get me wrong. But they have done nothing but great quarters." Radius Health: "Bob Ward [CEO], he has done a fantastic job, and I like Radius. Everyone keeps saying it's going to get a bid. I think it's going to have good test results, and therefore it is OK to own. But this whole bid thing is just getting out of control. I see this stock trading up a couple of bucks every morning, and I say come on." Chesapeake Energy: "Chesapeake's got good natural gas exposure, but my problem is that I don't like the balance sheet. And because of that, there are so many others that are better. I think that you should just stock with Schlumberger. I think Schlumberger is the way to play the oil business." Questions for Cramer?

News Hampton Economic development chief: sell the localities, not the region Ryan MurphyContact ReporterRmurphy@dailypress.com Privacy Policy Officials have long acknowledged that Hampton Roads needs to diversify its economic base, but the new head of the region's economic development alliance says localities need to differentiate themselves from one another as well. Rick Weddle, who started as CEO of the Hampton Roads Economic Development Alliance in April, told the Hampton Economic Development Authority Tuesday morning that a homogenous regional model isn't going to get more companies to move to Hampton Roads. "Everyone has been worried about regional identity, what the name is, not so much what the value proposition is," Weddle said. "The real value proposition is the value of these diverse, distinctive community brands. I think we need to build those up." He likened the idea to companies like General Motors or Procter & Gamble, which sell an array of products, each with its own strong brand identity. In the same way, he said, Hampton Roads localities should not try to sell a single regional brand, but rather figure out the strengths of each locality and market those instead. His pitch comes at a time when the region has been lagging behind comparable metro areas in recovering from the 2008 recession. In a presentation to the HREDA, Weddle pointed to several peer regions that returned to pre-recession jobs levels within an average of five years.

Jordan CEO John Lawson talks about encourging his employees to become involved in the community. Hampton Roads is looking at December 2018 — 11 years since the start of the recession — until it returns to those peak job numbers, Weddle said. "And that's only if we get on track. If we don't get busy doing what needs to get done, it could be a dozen years, it could be 15 years," Weddle said. Getting back on track would mean not only a firm plan of how to pitch Newport News, Hampton and the region's nine other localities to businesses across the nation and world, but also the ability to bring that plan to bear. "We've been kind of in decision congestion, decision gridlock. … There's so much traffic you can't figure out what lane you need to be in to get out of the roundabout," he said. "We need to move from analysis into action. We need to move from the conflict of seeing our differences as problems and see them as opportunities."

Rick Weddle hit the ground running as the new president and CEO of the Hampton Roads Economic Development Alliance in April. During his 36-year economic development career, Weddle helped bring thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in investment to Orlando, Fla., as head of the Orlando Economic... (Tara Bozick) To get there, Weddle said the HREDA needs more money – about 31 percent more than its current budget, or more than $715,000. He said that would bring it back up to a pre-recession funding level and the additional money would all be funneled into marketing and research, not salaries or overhead. He's not asking local governments to foot the bill — at least, not yet. The HREDA is a public-private partnership funded at about a three-to-one split between public agencies and private investors. He said the regional alliance would aim for 58,000 new jobs for Hampton Roads over the next five years, including 19,000 jobs in advanced industries — but it needs a hefty budget hike to do it. The challenge now, Weddle said, is convincing local businesses that helping the HREDA is helping themselves. One issue Weddle flags locally, which doesn't sound like a problem at first, is a high "closure rate" — a measure of how many of the businesses that take a serious look at Hampton Roads end up coming here. Regionally, Hampton Roads has around a 50 percent closure rate. That sounds good, but Weddle says the opposite is true – that the region should be getting a lot more serious looks than it is. "You're not going to close 80 or 90 percent. The only way to get that (number of new projects) up is to get more in the pipeline," he said. "In my experience, 35 years in this business, once a good plan is under way, you'll see a closure rate more in the 12, 18, 20 percent range." Rather than 10 major projects a year, he argued a region this size should be seeing 15 or 20 with more than 100 serious looks from businesses. Murphy can be reached by phone at 757-247-4760.

Most Popular The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. Duracell Star Wars Credit: Duracell via YouTube The next "Star Wars" flick is still more than eight weeks away, but the brand hype has begun. Duracell is out with a 60-second ad tied to the Dec. 16 release of "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" and a tie in to a charitable sponsorship of Children's Miracle Network. The ad from Anomaly for the battery brand, sold earlier this year by Procter & Gamble Co. to Berkshire Hathaway, shows a small detachment of child space rebels spreading cheer to a girl in a hospital. It backs a program through which Duracell will donate $100,000 and a million batteries for toys at 147 hospitals nationwide. "Star Wars toys are going to be the most iconic and culturally relevant toys of the year, so we are thrilled to be partnering with them," said Duracell Marketing Director Ramon Velutini. After visiting CMN hospitals, he said, "We saw firsthand the importance of imaginative play and the positive impact it can have on children." The campaign will run throughout the holidays across TV and online, with a Children's Miracle Network voiceover. Other marketers planning "Rogue One" integrations include General Mills, Gillette, Nissan and Verizon. For the second time this year, Axe has featured a winner of "RuPaul's Drag Race," this time featuring Alaska, winner of season 2 of the Logo network series, in an ad that ran during an Oct. 13 airing of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars. Alaska makes an appearance starting at second :14 of a revised 30-second version of the brand's "Find Your Magic" anthem ad from 72andSunny, which originally broke in January and ran on the Super Bowl, as part of what the brand says is its "inclusive take on masculinity." Axe also featured the winner of recently concluded season eight of the series, Christopher Caldwell, a.k.a. Bob the Drag Queen, immediately after his coronation in May. Tecate's beer wall ad -- which debuted during the first presidential debate -- has an approval rating that would make Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton jealous. The spot, which will air again tonight during coverage of the third and final debate, makes light of Mr. Trump's proposal to build a wall along the Mexican border. Despite the partisan overtones, the ad is playing well across America. It has been viewed 50 million times, including TV and digital, attaining an 86% positive sentiment score, according to Heineken USA. "Everyone got the idea that it is a Mexican brand that brews on the border and they are just going back to their roots," said Heineken USA Chief Marketing Officer Nuno Teles. More from the beer beat: What happens when a big brewer acquires a craft beer brand? You see more deals like the one MillerCoors just inked with the Atlanta Braves. The brewer this week announced that its newly acquired Terrapin brand will be the flagship craft beer at SunTrust Park, the new Braves stadium opening next year. MillerCoors took a majority interest in Athens, Ga.-based Terrapin Beer Company earlier this year. Craft brands typically don't have the budgets to ink big sports sponsorship deals. But under MillerCoors, Terrapin is going big with the Braves. The deal includes a taproom and microbrewery called Terrapin Taproom that will operate from a mixed use development called The Battery that is adjacent to SunTrust Park. From beer to pizza: In its first big push as the official pizza partner of the NCAA, Pizza Hut has a job for the ultimate NCAA sports fan. Pizza Hut is scouting for a fan to attend as many Division I NCAA championships as he or she can during the 2016-17 season. The winner, along with all expenses paid, will bring home $50,000 for the mid-November through early July gig. It's "a dream job for a college sports fan," said David Daniels, VP-media and advertising, Pizza Hut. Pizza Hut NCAA All-American Credit: Pizza Hut Of course, March Madness viewing parties are a key time for pizza sales. But the Pizza Hut All-American will also get to some of the more obscure title games, perhaps including fencing and bowling. "These don't get in the limelight very often," Mr. Daniels said. Pizza Hut has plans to promote itself at roughly 90 NCAA championships this school year, but will not be activating at the national championship for football, given the FBS is managed separately. Still, Pizza Hut can call itself the official pizza of college football as part of its multi-year deal. It is a return of sorts for Pizza Hut, which was the NCAA's official pizza partner during the 1990s. More recently, rival Domino's held that spot from 2011 to 2013. In other restaurant news, Red Robin, known to many for its bottomless fries, is placing a marketing bet on another side item: the onion ring. The chain's new "Let's Burger" campaign is its first big work under Senior VP-Chief Marketing Officer Jonathan Muhtar, who joined at the end of 2015. "'Let's Burger' is a departure from Red Robin's previous advertising approach and is intended to be more inclusive for all targets -- men, moms, millennials and multicultural," Mr. Muhtar said. The campaign includes a satirical spin on burger-related news called The Onion Ring, the chain's first association with The Onion and its Onion Labs division. Deb Maltzman, creative director and copywriter at Red Robin's agency of record, KBS, said the agency and the marketer were trying to do content in a way that stood out from what competition is doing. The Onion Ring microsite includes original content. The campaign is set to run at least through the end of the 2016. The Onion Ring Homepage Credit: Red Robin On to a healthier topic: Blue Cross Blue Shield Association is running a new campaign called "Fearless Nation" that tackles overall fitness issues like flossing and getting enough sleep. It includes seven digital videos and is part of the the "Live Fearless" effort the Chicago-based health insurer developed three years ago. "We wanted to create something that takes the idea of being healthy and makes it fun so people would engage with it," said Cynthia Rolfe, VP-marketing and brand at Blue Cross. The organization worked with McGarryBowen on the new push. "We wanted to go beyond the 'take the stairs' messages we've seen a million times," said Mike Wegener, creative director at McGarryBowen, noting that staging real-life stunts allowed the brand to capture "watchable stories that also happen to be educational." Apex Clearing Corp. ad Credit: Finsbury Financial custodian Apex Clearing Corp. is advertising its first work from Finsbury, which the Dallas-based firm began working with over a month ago. The digital, cheeky campaign features a personal ad designed to attract hedge funds who are no longer working with prime brokers like Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan. "Dumped by your mortgage broker?" the ad reads, before listing the assets of Apex's recently launched prime brokerage offering. This is the four-year-old Apex's first time advertising. Lastly, some hiring news: In time for toy season, GoldieBlox is ramping up its personnel starting with the hire of Kenny Davis as chief marketing officer. The toymaker promotes STEM skills -- science, technology, engineering and maths -- for girls. Mr. Davis joins the four-year-old toy brand from Hasbro. He plans to use his 20-year knowledge of the industry on new intellectual property products like TV shows, video games and toys. GoldieBlox has also hired Jenna Boyd from Nickelodeon as chief content officer and Jennifer Rahardjanoto from Mattel as creative director. GoldieBlox is planning a new book series with Random House and recently launched a coding app. Contributing: Jack Neff, Adrianne Pasquarelli, E.J.

Hearts & Science, a New York City marketing agency, was formed this spring after media giant Omnicom Group won the Procter & Gamble account. Several months later, the new unit landed AT&T. In a blink, it seemed, a startup had won the media buying business for the nation’s two largest advertisers. Combined, the giants spend over $4 billion on measured media. Hearts & Science recently opened a shop in downtown Dallas, across the street from AT&T headquarters. Over 30 employees are in place with plans to have over 100 by year end, the company said. The rapid ascension of an all-new agency says something about the state of advertising and AT&T. Both are changing rapidly and trying to capitalize on the dramatic shift to more digital and mobile technology. Refuse to pay for video? AT&T hopes new streaming options turn you on More customers watch video on phones and through video streaming services, and listen to radio on the internet. Reaching those audiences requires more than broadcast TV ads. At the same time, AT&T is expanding into streaming entertainment and creating original content. Those initiatives are about to ramp up as AT&T continues to build its DirecTV franchise. “We were looking for a media agency that really understands the new marketing landscape,” said Fiona Carter, AT&T’s senior vice president for brand marketing, advertising and sponsorships. AT&T's Fiona Carter says "liberating the data" about consumers can help create more effective advertising. DANIEL EUBANK EyeCapturePhoto Hearts & Science recruited top leaders from Omnicom and other ad agencies, and they have strong relationships with Facebook, Snapchat and LinkedIn, she said.  The agency collects data on what customers are watching, listening to and talking about. That  will tell AT&T where to put its message -- which programs, platforms and apps. But AT&T also wanted to bridge the usual gap between media planners and the creatives who dream up campaigns. This was seen as a chance to integrate data analysis, media buying and creative. Hearts & Science will collaborate with BBDO, the Omnicom creative agency that also landed AT&T work. Better feedback, in near real time, is expected to be more effective and efficient. “I call it liberating the data,” Carter said. “It can inform the creative work in ways that haven’t been done before.” Carter joined AT&T a year ago, after working over a decade at BBDO in New York and briefly at its Omnicom parent. When Hearts & Science launched in April, it was described as a data-driven marketing agency with media planning and buying, and other services. To build a new kind of agency, it’s recruiting people who don’t usually work in advertising, said Tara Levine, chief experience officer. That includes data scientists, management consultants and analysts in finance and statistics. Embedding those experts with the creatives will produce better insights, she said. “There’s a tendency to think the only creative work comes out of creative agencies,” Levine said. “But a lot of creativity and innovation can be data driven. It can make a big difference when you have data at your fingertips.” Dallas-based AT&T launches DirecTV app that streams live TV, recorded shows To some local players, this idea doesn’t sound revolutionary. Digital marketing generates a growing share of most advertising budgets already, and data analytics have grown with it. Last year, digital accounted for over 40 percent of revenue at ad agencies, according to Advertising Age. That’s up from about a quarter of revenue in 2009. The challenge is harnessing the big data that comes from digital, said Russel Wohlwerth, principal of External View Consulting Group in Los Angeles. He said Hearts & Science is connecting the dots by using data science and intuition. And then melding creatives, media buyers and analysts. “You can’t look only at the numbers,” he said. “Every media agency is taking note, trying to figure out the secret sauce.” Carter said it's valuable for Hearts & Science to open an office in Dallas. The ad business is moving so fast that it helps to walk over and tackle problems immediately. “It’s great to sit side-by-side and work on all that together,” she said. The Richards Group founder discusses 'shock' of losing Chick-Fil-A ad campaign The expansion also represents a boost for an industry dealing with disruption. Ad agencies often face tight budgets, intense competition and more frequent client reviews. This summer, the Richards Group in Dallas lost the Chick-fil-A account after 22 years. That was despite great success in creating a brand identity around the "Eat Mor Chikin" campaign. Such turnover is a sign of the times in advertising. In recent years, an unprecedented number of accounts have been put up for agency review. Both AT&T and Procter & Gamble walked away from long-time engagements to sign with Hearts & Science. Clients are trying to both cut costs and connect with a young audience. Instead of 30-second TV spots, some are making inroads with longer segments that are more entertaining. AT&T created a series about high school students, Summer Break, that’s run for four seasons. AT&T products and services are embedded in the story, and the series is on YouTube. That's not advertising in the traditional sense. “We’re trying to create video that stops you from scrolling through,” Carter said. “That’s the right kind of content for the digital generation.” View Comments Tags Business Dallas AT&T Commentary Share Facebook Twitter Email Print This Story Get the Most Important D-FW News in Your Inbox Sign up for our daily email newsletters Get Headlines, Business, SportsDay, and GuideLive.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Lisa Rein October 19 Follow @Reinlwapo Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, left, and former House speaker Newt Gingrich during a campaign rally in Cincinnati in July. (John Minchillo/Associated Press) Former Republican House speaker Newt Gingrich, a leading adviser to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, is urging the candidate to take on a thorny issue if he’s elected: Overhaul the civil service so it’s easier to fire bad apples. The idea goes to the heart of Republican frustration with what some derisively refer to as federal workers’ lifetime tenure. Republican proposals in Congress to cut benefits and punish wrongdoing have picked up steam in recent years following scandals over veterans’ care, lavish conference spending and IRS scrutiny of tax-exempt groups. But a major push to make changes to how the federal workforce is managed would run into fierce political opposition in Washington. [House tries again to give Veterans Affairs more power to discipline employees] Democrats are generally allies of the public employee unions that represent the 2 million civil servants, and they resist GOP proposals to chip away at their pensions and job protections. Nonetheless, Gingrich is urging Trump to make the performance of the federal workforce a priority, making a case for why it should be easier to fire poor performers and those with records of misconduct. Under current law, it’s difficult to do. Gingrich spoke with The Washington Post Tuesday afternoon about why he’s telling Trump that better management of federal workers is so important. The conversation has been lightly edited for clarity. Q. Why should federal employees be on the radar of a President Trump so quickly? A. You have a story in USA Today today [about new leadership] at VA. You have Bob McDonald, the VA secretary, who was a pretty good CEO, but he’s now so absorbed by the [federal] bureaucracy that he accepts things he never would have accepted when he ran Procter & Gamble. He suggested that 90 percent of VA medical centers have new leadership. Actually there are eight people hired from outside the agency, out of 140 medical center directors. So that’s not quite 6 percent. The rest have just been moved around. Q. So you’re saying that some VA managers who did not do their jobs should have been fired but weren’t? And that’s the problem in government? A.  That’s a large part of what’s wrong. If you read President Obama’s comments when he appointed [former VA secretary Eric] Shinseki, the president said VA is a broken agency and we have to fix it. Now years later you come down to an agency filled with failure to achieve things. One out of three suicide prevention lines goes over to voice mail. That’s criminal behavior. And yet until were prepared to reform the civil service model — and the Pendleton Act [which established the civil service] passed 133 years ago — you have no ability to fire people who are really bad. Q. Okay, so why is it so hard to fire bad apples in government? A. Attitudinally, you have to ask that question. Why? In a private-sector company if you have someone who fudged 3,000 appointments for veterans so the hospital would look like it worked better, you say, who was accountable? Who got fired? Who went to jail? Dumping 3,000 names ought to be illegal. The quagmire is so bad. It’s a very simple watershed: Should the president, through his appointees, have the power to fire people who are corrupt? We think you’ve done bad things, and now you pay the penalty. The threshold question is: How sick does the system have to get for you to admit it has to be reformed? Q. What has Trump’s reaction been when you press him to make this issue a priority? A. He’s talking about it a little bit. I think it’s actually a very good place to draw a contrast with Hillary. I would not be at all surprised to see [Trump make] a speech on reforming the whole civil service system. Q. Would change like this to how government is managed be possible in Washington? Where would the fault lines be? A. So there are two groups in Washington on this issue who are initially opposed. First, you have the hard-line federal employee unions. They’re like the teachers union in New York. There are parallels. They are the group that, no matter how sick it is, they have a vested interest in the old order. Then there are people who know better and are embarrassed, but they think the fight will be so big they can’t bring themselves to take it on. Chairman [Jeff] Miller (R-Fla.) in the House, he, more than the Senate leaders, has been much more willing to take on the unions and offer real reform on veterans issues. The Democrats start from a premise of: We can’t touch any of this. We had the first big fundraiser for Scott Walker [the GOP governor who moved to limit collective bargaining for public employees] in Wisconsin. The minute they passed reforms, there were literally death threats again him and his wife. If Trump were to win, you would have this. This will not be a problem for Hillary, as she will take care of the unions. Q. So the Democrats are satisfied with the status quo? Do they get a lot of money from federal unions? A. It’s money, but it’s also numbers. If you’re a member of Congress from the Washington suburbs, guess who you listen to? Q. So what happened with these issues when you were House speaker in the 1990s? A. We passed administrative reform acts, but at the time, frankly, of all the things we were trying to do, we didn’t pivot on reforming the civil service. It was only after I was out of office advising people in the (George W.) Bush administration that I began to realize if you don’t fix this problem, nothing in government is going to work. Q. Why is it so important that, to use your word, bad employees are forced out? A. As the system continues to decay, if you have a system which defends incompetence with bad people, then good people will leave. The system gets sicker and sicker. Right after World War II, the U.S. government was an amazing system. Q. Would government service improve if incompetent workers or those who really messed up had to go? A. Everyone benefits. You can actually do something. A person who actually got the VA fixed could point to veterans getting better health care. Or you reform NASA so it’s focused on actually getting into space, and you would have the advantage of a lot more achievements in space. At DOD [the Defense Department] you would cut through all of the planning and procurement baloney that’s just killing us. Q. So now you’re saying that government moves slowly. What’s the connection with poor performers? A. They’re mutually tied together. They’re two parallel questions. If you have too much bureaucracy, it has to justify itself. All the bureaucrats with nothing to do slow things down so they have nothing to do. Eisenhower’s national security council was made up of 24 people, I think. Now it’s about 500. Do we really think the national strategic decisions made by the Eisenhower administration were less important than those made today?

"We've sliced audiences far too thin," according to Zak Treuhaft, president of Hearts & Science, the OMG-owned, data-driven marketing agency originally set up to handle P&G's $2.6bn media business. "If I go to a creative agency and say 'I have 400 segments, each one of which will receive a completely different message', no creative a) wants that assignment or b) can likely find 400 different versions of an ad for 400 different targets," he told Beet.tv. "I think we'll find a nice equilibrium where there are slightly different spins on slightly different campaigns and creativity will live across multiple screens in different ways, but not all the way to N equals a million," he added. Up to now, he suggested, the danger has been that the industry becomes obsessed by the tools at its disposal, rather like the proverbial child in a candy store. He also observed a parallel between cross-screen addressability and the early days of digital advertising. "First into the boat will be people who can very easily model out and attribute direct sales to their message," he said – typically categories such as automotive, travel & tourism and electronics that involve high cost and high consideration and where "far down the funnel there's an intense need to address a very specific person". But he expected that cross-screen addressable advertising would become the norm for all categories "as the value of the data that lives inside that campaign becomes more widely understood and more easily scaled". The notion of balance also extends to the way that cross-screen addressability allows marketers to adjust campaigns depending on the outcome sought. "Part of the promise of addressable is that it allows you to tune and target whatever work you're doing with a lot greater fidelity," Treuhaft said. "If you're looking for more efficient it work it allows you to reinvest more dollars in other parts of your marketing programs or elsewhere – that's where the promise of addressable lives."

Bill Rinehart / WVXU Listen Listening... / 3:51 People who live in Madisonville like to say their neighborhood is one of the most welcoming in Greater Cincinnati and also one of the most racially balanced. The community has had population shifts in the past, and appears to be undergoing another change. When Addie Hunter moved to Madisonville almost 47 years ago her family was the first black one on the block. Neighbors welcomed them. That was 1969, when integration wasn't common in America. "We had a lot of good people. Most of them worked for Procter and Gamble on our street. And they taught my boys how to cut grass and gave us stuff and told them how to keep the house up. And they taught them. And it was good. So we had good friends then." Recently, she's noticed more whites moving in and blacks moving out. "It bothers me a little bit because I wish they would hold on and try to do better. But the younger people don't want to stay it seems like. The parents leave the homes and they're gone." Hunter says three of her own children moved to Atlanta about a decade ago.  Bill Collins has lived in Madisonville for 23 years. He also sees black middle class people moving out and as a white man it worries him. "I don't really like living in all white communities. I find them kind of dull." But beyond that, Collins says the neighborhood is losing leaders. "It's the fact that so many of the young, working class and middle class African-Americans who grew up there in the 80s and 90s and 2000s who would be really good leaders in the community, potentially, that they're leaving. That’s what concerns me the most." Collins says he's looked at the census data and found out why people leave the neighborhoods. It's jobs. Or a lack of them. Community leaders say there are developments underway that will create jobs., that will take care of maintaining income diversity for Madisonville.  But keeping up racial diversity will take some more thought. Luke Brockmeyer says as the president of the community council, he can't just make plans that will appeal to 30-something white guys like himself. He says if an event or a neighborhood is to succeed he has to think about the wants and needs of his neighbors, who may or may not look like him. "And life is way better when you do that. I mean you're happier. You spend more time thinking. You have more friends. You're better informed. I think there are a lot of people who have never lived in a neighborhood like this who would hear that and say 'that sounds like a lot of work.' But it isn't. It's part of being human and it makes you more human." That's not to say Madisonville is a racial utopia. Community Council Vice President Prentis Wilson says when she came to the community in 1965, there was integration, but not much mingling. She says there are still barriers today. "There are some people two or three doors up from me, they don't have a clue as to how black people feel. And a lot of black people don't have a clue as to how white people feel." Wilson says Madisonville is more diverse than ever before. She says her street right now is pretty much 50-50, white and black. You can't make a community diverse. You can nudge it in that direction but in the end it comes down to individuals. That's what 32-year-old Brant Walker seems to think. "Some people know how to live around each other and other people don't. It all depends on who you are and what you believe in." That's how a lot of people in Madisonville apparently see it too.  It may not always be easy to discuss race, but as Bill Collins and Luke Brockmeyer put it, you have to be willing to talk and to listen.

Top issue in Crescent Springs: Economic development Melissa Reinert, mstewart@communitypress.com 8:31 p.m. EDT October 17, 2016 A view of Joella’s Hot Chicken restaurant in Crescent Springs. Joella’s opened right across the street from Nashville Hot chicken restaurant in April. Economic development is the top issue in the Crescent Springs City Council election. (Photo: File photo) CRESCENT SPRINGS - Seven candidates are seeking a spot on the six-seat Crescent Springs City Council. This election all incumbents, except for Councilman Louis Prabell, one newcomer and a former councilman are running. Christie Arlinghaus Councilwoman Christie Arlinghaus is seeking her sixth term on council. She is a retired executive from the Internal Revenue Service and currently serves as chairwoman of the city’s Communications Committee. “I want to continue to expand our business community,” she said. “I feel the city should be reaching out to developers to bring new business into the city. I want to continue to keep property taxes low along with the insurance premium tax.” Mike Daugherty Councilman Mike Daugherty, 54, is finishing his second year on council this term, but has served a total of eight years as a member of council. He works for Zwicker & Associates and is running again because he believes in civic involvement. He said the top two issues facing the city are economic development and city stability. “We need to continue to work with businesses that are currently in the community and those that might wish to join our community to make Crescent Springs a place that businesses want to locate,” he said. “We need to continue to be good stewards of our taxpayers’ money. We are relatively debt free, and we need to continue to watch all line items to remain in a good position.” Carter Dickerson Newcomer Carter Dickerson, 34, has served on the city’s Board of Adjustments since January 2015. He is a professional landscape architect at Viox & Viox Inc. He is running for council to “bring the perspective of the younger family demographic.” According to Dickerson, the city has a strong foundation on which it can improve. “I hope to work with the mayor and City Council on how best to improve our city and the ways that it can most be enjoyed by our citizens,” he said. “I also want to be a conduit through which all citizens feel that they can be represented and have their voices heard by city leadership.” Bob Mueller Councilman Bob Mueller is finishing his second term on City Council since he was last elected. He also served on council in 2005 and 2006. Mueller, 60, is a purchasing manager with Procter and Gamble. He’s seeking re-election because this is something he loves. “If this is something you love, then you have to do it,” he said. “I want to maintain the financial stability of the city, I enjoy this work. The decisions I participate in affect my neighbors and me. This is a great way to impact your community.” According to Mueller, the business community in the city should be a top priority. “We’re seeing economic development or the business community in a state of turnover,” he said. “The economy has challenged businesses to be more frugal in how they operate. We need to work on attracting and maintaining businesses. We have to market ourselves more aggressively and look at our tax structure and incentive programs.” Dale Ramsey Dale Ramsey, 58, previously served on City Council from 2000 to 2014. He works for G4S Security. “I’m seeking re-election to help serve the city I live in, and it’s citizens,” he said. “Our current City Council is doing a very good job taking care of issues concerning the city. I want to be a part of that.” Thomas Vergamini Councilman Thomas Vergamini, 65, has served on council since 1999. He is an attorney and seeking re-election to “continue to serve the city and its residents in order to provide the most efficient, workable solutions to issues facing a small suburban city.” According to Vegamini, the top two issues facing Crescent Springs are economic development and the heroin epidemic. “(We need to) establish an economic development plan and market the city as a place to do conduct a thriving, successful business and for individuals to locate as a place to call home,” he said. To fight the heroin epidemic, he said the city needs to “seek collaborative solutions with health care, social service providers and surrounding communities.” Matthew Zeck Councilman Matthew Zeck, 46, has served on council since 2006. He is a commercial sales manager of cash management services for Fifth Third Bank. “The good news for the city of Crescent Springs is that there are not any urgent or troubling issues,” he said. “The city officially became debt free in September of 2016, an incredible accomplishment by the staff and finance committee of the city on behalf of the residents and taxpayers. “While some cities are facing major street repair issues or loss of business revenues or deteriorating property values, Crescent Springs is poised to further strengthen its infrastructure and make improvements to drive more efficiency.” Two issues that will be on the forefront to address, he said, are the continued review of possible consolidation of services and ongoing efficiency opportunities to improve service delivery to the residents of Crescent Springs. Examples are installation LED street lights to improve energy usage and capture expense savings, he said. “As we have for the past many years, I will participate in the continual evaluation of the services needed by the residents and analyzing the pros and cons and expense versus benefit of consolidation of services, such as police and equipment, etc.” Regarding ongoing efficiency opportunities, Zeck said, he will “continue to be active in the projects that seek to drive efficiency and cost savings opportunities, without reducing the quality of offerings our residents receive.” Want to continue the conversation?

By Josh Kolm October 19, 2016 Product discovery and review platform Influenster is opening an office in Toronto to create a more uniquely Canadian experience for both clients and users. More than two million members review products on the platform, particularly those in the CPG and health and beauty categories. In addition to posting their own reviews, users also discover new products by connecting with other consumers. Influenster also has an internal editorial team that produces content based around new product launches, or particular trends and themes. Brands that partner with Influenster can have samples of their products sent directly to members who are interested in a particular category, or represent a demographic or lifestyle the brand is looking to engage. Thanks to a recent partnership with Ebates earlier this year, which saw the online discount company invest $8 million into Influenster, members can also discover new products by receiving discounts on certain items. Aydin Acar, co-founder and CEO of Influenster, says the main thing that separates it from other review-centric sites like Amazon (which Influenster ranks behind, at number two, in terms of the total number of reviews) is it’s highly engaged user base. It also collects a great deal of data from members when they sign up, allowing it to target product samples to members more accurately. “On any given day, we have 35,000 new reviews come in from our members,” he says. “They ask each other questions and compare products based on their opinions, and we give them a platform to share their reviews and opinions with their own social networks. So not only are they more engaged, they become influencers when they share their content on their own.” Acar says opening a Canadian office was “no-brainer.” Roughly 10% of Influenster members are Canadian, and the company has been running campaigns here for clients including P&G, Keurig and L’Oréal since 2014 as an extension of its U.S. work. In addition to Toronto being a “hub” for start-ups and tech companies, Acar says there was a major demand from both existing clients and Canadian members to have a team on the ground here – instead of running campaigns from its head office in New York – so it could build more local insights and create a uniquely Canadian user experience. Trey Geiger will lead the Toronto office as director of business development. Prior to joining Influenster, Geiger held leadership positions at Vancouver tech company Keycafe, multi-channel network BroadbandTV and design studio Disruptive Media Publishers. The team in Canada will be small to start, with a total of five employees working in Toronto by the middle of next year.

Moreover, increase in the number of product offerings to tap the fluctuating grooming habits of men and organized retail further fuel the market growth. In addition, the global upsurge in online retail platforms, and the escalation in health, and fitness consciousness among men is anticipated to offer more business opportunities. However, rise in packaging costs could prove to be a major challenge for the players. " The increasing bent towards corporate life and rising awareness towards men ' s grooming , specifically among the youth is expected to boost the demand of personal care products. Moreover, launch of herbal products with low chemical content has witnessed remarkable growth in the men personal care market " , states Yogiata Sharma, Research Analyst, and Consumer Goods at AMR.  The global men personal care market is segmented by type and geography. The segmentation by type includes hair care (shampoos & rinses, hair gels, hair conditioners, hair sprays,  hair creams, and hair dyes & hair colors), shaving (shaving soaps, shaving creams, after shave lotions, and pre-shave lotions), oral care (dental care, mouth washes,  and breath fresheners), personal cleanliness (fragrances, soaps, and body powders), skin care (face & neck creams/lotions, body & hand creams/lotions, cleansers, and moisturizers), and others (facial makeup, eye makeup, bathing essentials, and nail care).

To support Ad Age and the industry we cover please either: SUBSCRIBE or WHITELIST US Too Many Marketers Get Total Market Totally Wrong By Rochelle Newman-Carrasco. Published on October 19, 2016. Most Popular If I were to give last week's ANA 2016 Multicultural Marketing and Diversity Conference a title, it would be: "12 Steps to Cultural Competence and Confidence." Over three days in Los Angeles, industry leaders acknowledged that they are playing cultural catch up and recognized that, while well intended, misuse of the "total market" concept combining so-called mainstream plus diverse segments is suppressing culturally-specific voices and vision -- the very perspectives necessary for brands to make targeted consumer connections. A total market course correction is in order and Association of National Advertisers' CEO Bob Liodice wasted no time in bringing this concern to the forefront at the conference, attended by about 700 people. Mr. Liodice cited at least eight examples of "what happens when the industry gets together" -- pointing to ANA-led initiatives that have had an impact, from the Ad Council's consumer-facing social responsibility work to an industry-focused stop to digital ad fraud. In this spirit, Mr. Liodice announced the formation of The Association of Inclusive and Multicultural Marketing (AIMM), a coalition designed to "build a community of multicultural champions, advocates and experts." Gilbert Davila. Credit: Erin Becker Conference chair Gilbert Davila, president and CEO of Davila Multicultural Insights, and a founding AIMM board member, explained the coalition's goals: "Our intention is not to speak to the choir. With the support of ANA's executive leadership, we intend to elevate the conversation and bring it to corporate C-suites so that multicultural and inclusive marketing becomes the business imperative that it deserves to be." Lizette Williams, multicultural marketing leader at Kimberly-Clark, did not mince words when, during one of the first panels of the conference, she said, "Total market strategy has been largely misunderstood. Total market strategy was never intended to be a cost-cutting measure to drive efficiencies. It was actually quite the opposite. It was designed to drive inclusivity and effectiveness of messaging." Over the past few years, many marketers and agencies have been concocting their own total market scenarios, adopting the approach as a check-the-box strategy that brings to mind an old Total cereal slogan: "1 Bowl. 100%." In these cases, total market has really been more like a sugar substitute: all the taste of inclusiveness but only half the involvement. A few future-focused marketers, however, did understand total market as a "yes, and" proposition -- one that encouraged culturally insightful total and targeted ideas to take shape. You might say, these marketers went the Wheaties route, becoming total market champions by getting their strategies off to the right start with upfront investments in insights and with collaborative processes that nourished culturally attuned ecosystems. Never expecting a magical fix to a complex pursuit, these marketers set their priorities and re-engineered processes, not always succeeding but always learning and never turning back. And these were the marketing champions selected to share best practices at this year's ANA conference. Case studies consistently demonstrated the value of using a culturally specific lens in tandem with the wide-angle get-everyone-into-the-picture approach. Marketers underscored the importance of getting close to what consumers care about, particularly where social issues are concerned. No stranger to social causes, Macy's Director of Multicultural Customer Strategy, Maria Rios, shared a perspective that was echoed by fellow retailer Lane Bryant in a presentation on body equality. "The marketer is in a position to listen and lead," said Ms. Rios. "We can take conversations to places that align with brand values." Related Stories Coke, McDonald's, Toyota, Nestle Win ANA Multicultural Awards A Crisis Gone to Waste: Why Samsung Shouldn't Have Canceled ANA Presentation Procter & Gamble Commits to Saturday Morning Peace and Equality Initiative Why the Ad Industry's Diversity Strategy Needs a New Brief Ivan Pollard, Coca-Cola's SVP-strategic marketing, stated that brands need to stand "for something beyond themselves," adding that "millennials are demanding brands take a stand and support social causes." His Coca-Cola colleague Lauventria Robinson, VP-Multicultural Center of Excellence, moderated a compelling panel titled "Speak Up or Stay Silent" and focused on the role of brands regarding social injustice. Philanthropist and entrepreneur-artist Tyrese used a Titanic analogy to point out ways in which corporate America is "out of touch" and is suppressing the kind of diversity of thinking that could, in fact, keep brands from sinking. The conference closed with a powerful presentation by Saturday Morning, a coalition forged by advertising creatives in service to societal change. The tip of the iceberg isn't the problem. It's our fear of what lies below the surface and our resistance to facing that fear. What the ANA's Bob Liodice said bears repeating: "When our industry gets together we can …" With the content of this conference and AIMM, the new coalition, it seems marketers are ready to go deep, which would be aiming in the right direction.

To support Ad Age and the industry we cover please either: SUBSCRIBE or WHITELIST US Amid U.S. Marketing Push, Avon Hires Horizon Media as AOR By Lindsay Stein. Published on October 19, 2016. Avon's Credit: Avon Most Popular Avon has hired Horizon Media as agency-of-record for offline media and activation in the U.S., a move that comes after the beauty brand separated from its global parent in March and became a privately held company in North America. The North American business, which is now majority-owned by Cerberus Capital Management, operates under the name New Avon, but is still known as Avon to consumers and representatives, said Matt Harker, VP-marketing for the company. Mr. Harker said the brand is investing "significantly" more in marketing next year, especially in offline media and digital. He declined to provide further financial information, but said Cerberus, which invested $435 million in Avon, is focused on amplifying the brand in North America. Horizon was awarded the business following a competitive review. Avon has not had an incumbent for offline media in North America in a number of years, said Mr. Harker, adding that Mediavest has worked on offline media for the company in international markets. In addition to Horizon, Avon recently hired Terri & Sandy as its creative agency partner. Horizon and Terri & Sandy recently worked together on Avon's new "This is Boss Life" campaign, which launched two weeks ago across national TV, local broadcast, print and radio, such as BET, OWN, Bravo, local CBS and NBC, People, Redbook, Better Homes & Gardens, DJ Chatter and more. Mr. Harker said Horizon's ability to help Avon figure out "the power of segmentation" and who to target with its new campaign is really powerful because the brand is looking to reach future entrepreneurs, so it needs to understand the behavior and psychographics of that audience. "The campaign is about the flexibility and freedom that people are seeking in this job economy that you can get when you become an Avon representative," said Mr. Harker. "There's nothing more beautiful than succeeding on your own terms." In addition to Horizon and Terri & Sandy, New Avon worked with SocialCode on social media; London-based The Media Image for digital SEM and programmatic; and Pixability on YouTube. On the PR side, Tractenberg & Co. handles earned media around beauty, such as beauty influencer engagement, while Finn Partners is helping to tell the story about Avon's women and men who have an impact on their communities, said Mr. Harker. Avon will continue to push out its "Boss Life" initiative over the next few months, but Mr. Harker said the company will also launch more campaigns in 2017. In April, former Procter & Gamble marketing executive J. Scott White joined New Avon as CEO. Most recently he served as president of international nutrition for Abbott Laboratories, but before that he held roles throughout his 15 years at P&G including marketing director of global hair care, marketing director of Mexico and Central America and marketing director of Latin America Hair Care. Last year, New Avon, which has about 400,000 independent sales representatives across the U.S. Puerto Rico and Canada, earned more than $1 billion in revenue, according to a company statement.

Pradeep Gaur/Mint New Delhi: On 25 August, ITC Ltd filed a suit before the Delhi high court claiming copyright and trademark infringement by Britannia Industries Ltd, which it said was trying to pass off Britannia NutriChoice Zero digestive biscuit as ITC’s Sunfeast Farmlite Digestive All Good biscuit. The blue-and-yellow pack of Britannia’s biscuit, said the suit, was similar to that of ITC’s. Britannia’s arguments were expected to be defensive in nature. Instead, the company went on the offensive, claimed 66% share and leadership in the digestive biscuits category, and told the court that it was in the process of filing a cross-suit against ITC Ltd for the use of yellow colouring in digestive biscuits. Britannia’s own digestive biscuits do so and are yellow. The court heard both the original suit and the so-called cross-suit. It issued an order restraining Britannia from selling its digestive biscuits NutriChoice Zero and phase out existing stocks. Cross-suits have become the flavour of the season. At least four consumer packaged goods companies filed cross-suits in the Delhi high court over the past month against rivals suing them. “These days companies have extensive in-house and external legal assistance available to them and are also well aware of their rights. Most have a well laid out litigation strategy. When legal actions are initiated against a company, there is an increasing tendency to raise counter claims or cross actions for breach of contractual or common law rights.” said Shankh Sengupta, partner at Trilegal. Many a times, these cross actions serve as an effective offensive strategy to put the counter party on a back foot. For instance, in contractual disputes, counter parties have increasingly started raising a counter claim or cross action for breach of the rights provided to them, more often as a pressure tactic. In many such cases, the claims and counter claims are decided together by the courts, he added. A cross-suit is a suit filed by the party against which the original suit was filed, and which is then heard as part of the same case. Many of these cross-suits, claiming damages in excess of Rs 1 crore, are being used as a strategic tool by these packaged goods companies to gain a fair advantage in the original cases against them, say lawyers. Indeed, “enforcing legal rights” is perhaps becoming as “important” as “marketing”, senior advocate, Prathibha Singh, said. Britannia was yet responded to Mint’s email seeking comments sent Thursday afternoon. An ITC spokesperson declined to comment on the issue. The companies behind the original soap wars are at it too filing several cross suits against each other. Hindustan Unilever Ltd and Procter & Gamble are both claiming that the other’s ads are disparaging its brand. The brands in question are HUL’s Clinc Plus shampoo and P&G’s Head & Shoulders shampoo. On 9 September, the Delhi high court restrained HUL from airing any advertisements of Clinic Plus but the dispute, and two cross-suits remain unresolved. “Litigation is the last resort for us. We believe in strengthening self regulatory bodies and redressal of disputes through alternative dispute settlements. We have also set up, and over the years, institutionalized the Ombudsman Scheme to resolve commercial disputes with customers, suppliers and consumers through a process of mediation facilitated by independent and reputed judicial minds who are retired High Court judges.”, said an HUL spokesperson. A P&G spokesperson declined to comment on the issue. Lawyers expect several more packaged goods companies to resort to cross-suits as the courts become the newest battleground for them.

shift to home healthcare is one of several strategies being deployed to reduce the inevitable growth in the cost of delivering healthcare services. As a result, some types of medical devices and home healthcare equipment originally designed for exclusive use in hospitals and clinical settings by trained professionals are being redesigned for use by patients and lay caregivers in home environments. This dramatic shift in the delivery of healthcare is creating new opportunities for manufacturers of home healthcare equipment. Increase in ageing population, growing incidence of chronic diseases and rising healthcare expenditure are some of the key factors driving the growth of global home medical equipment market. In addition, increasing awareness about the conveniences and cost effectiveness offered by home medical equipment, Increase in the patient preference for home-based care, Upsurge in insured population as a result of the Affordable Care Act, technological advancements such as tele-health, wearable devices, mobile health applications etc; and various government initiatives to promote home healthcare are further contributing to the growth of home medical equipment market. However, changing reimbursement policies, limited insurance coverage, risk to safety and health of home healthcare worker, and growing patient safety concerns are some of the major factors that may hinder the growth of this market during the forecast period. The global home medical equipment market is mainly segmented into home tests and patient monitoring equipment which includes fertility tests, pregnancy tests, gender, dna& parental tests, drug tests, alcohol tests, cholesterol tests, HIV tests, holter monitors, blood pressure monitors, oximeters, heart rate monitors, thermometers, mediscopes, stethoscopes, defibrillators, pedometers, scales & body fat monitors, peak flow meters, apnea monitors, baby monitors, coagulation monitors, and diabetes management devices; home therapeutic equipment which includes home respiratory therapy equipment (continuous positive airway pressure equipment, oxygen delivery equipment, nebulizers & accessories, ventilators & accessories, and humidifiers), home dialysis equipment (home peritoneal dialysis products, home hemodialysis products) home IV equipment ( IV pumps, and other home IV equipment) and others; patient support equipment which includes wheelchairs and related equipment (wheelchairs- manual wheelchairs and powered wheelchairs), walking assist devices, mobility scooters, medical furniture and accessories, and bathroom safety equipment. The global home medical equipment market is further segmented by geography into five major continents namely, North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East and Africa. These regions are further analyzed at a country level to provide the market size and forecast for each segment and sub-segment of the market in various countries across the globe. North America dominates the global home medical equipment market owing to the presence of high sophisticated healthcare infrastructure, positive response to the home healthcare, favorable reimbursement policies, increasing investment in R&D facilities, and presence of large number of small and large scale home medical devices manufactures. Moreover, the recent changes in the healthcare industry due to 'Obamacare Act' will also boost the demand for such equipment, since almost 30 million uninsured Americans will now enjoy medical coverage. Similarly, Europe accounted for the second largest share of the total home medical equipment market owing to increasing aging population, high prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, and increasing healthcare investments by the European government. On the other hand, Asia-Pacific home medical equipment market is expected to grow at a rapid pace during the forecast period owing to the increasing geriatric population as elder people are prone to many disorders such as orthopedic, cardiovascular and others, rising awareness about the cost effectiveness and convenience offered by these home medical devices, and rising health care expenditures in emerging countries such as India and China, which are projected to be the fastest-growing countries in the Asian home medical equipment market during the forecast period.

Carolan, 47, will lead the division that includes Bolthouse Farms beverages, salad dressings and carrots, Garden Fresh Gourmet salsa, hummus and dips, and fresh soup, which combined account for approximately $1 billion in net sales.   Carolan will succeed Jeff Dunn, who is leaving Campbell to become Chief Executive Officer of Juicero, Inc., the San Francisco-based startup that recently launched the first professional-quality, connected countertop cold-press juicer. Campbell has invested $13.5 million in Juicero, which is focused on inventing products, services and experiences that help people consume more fresh fruits and vegetables.   Dunn also will remain involved in Acre Venture Partners, the independent venture capital operation to which Campbell committed $125 million in 2016, as a venture partner. Additionally, Campbell will retain its seat on Acre’s investment committee, as well as its board observer seat at Juicero. Both positions will be held by Adam Ciongoli, Campbell’s General Counsel.   Commenting on Dunn’s departure, Campbell’s President and Chief Executive Officer Denise Morrison said, “Jeff has made important contributions to Campbell during his time with the company. We wish him well as he embarks on a new and exciting chapter of his career, and I look forward to continuing to collaborate with him through Acre Venture Partners and in his new role at Juicero.”   Carolan and Dunn will work together to manage the transition over the next several weeks.   Commenting on Carolan’s appointment, Morrison said, “Ed is an excellent leader who has played a critical role as we pursue Campbell’s strategic imperatives and transform the way we work. He brings both strategic insights and deep experience as a hands-on operator with a long track record of delivering outstanding business results. In his new role, he will be supported by a strong and seasoned leadership team at C-Fresh. I am confident that Ed and the team will continue to expand our presence in the faster-growing packaged fresh category.”   Carolan joined Campbell in 2001 and has successfully led several significant businesses and functions. Most recently, he served as President of Integrated Global Services (IGS). Formed in January 2015, IGS is Campbell’s global shared services organization focused on building enterprise capabilities while lowering costs. In that role, Carolan created and implemented a business model designed to unlock value for the company, build new capabilities and deliver faster and more efficient services. Under Carolan’s leadership, IGS drove cost savings that contributed to the company’s gross margin expansion and record cash flow from operations in fiscal 2016.   Earlier in his career, as President, US Retail, Carolan was responsible for Campbell’s $3.6 billion US Soup, Sauces and Beverages business. He also led the US Soup and Simple Meals business for Campbell, where he drove five consecutive quarters of growth in US soup, including 5 percent growth in fiscal 2013. Previously, he served as General Manager – Pepperidge Farm Snacks Division, leading the crackers and cookies business, where he accelerated growth behind Goldfish crackers. From 2006 to 2009, he was General Manager of Campbell’s StockPot® fresh soup and North America Foodservice businesses.   Before joining Campbell, Carolan spent five years in brand management at Procter & Gamble. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology and a Master of Business Administration from Harvard Business School.   Kessler To Lead IGS   Bethmara Kessler, previously Vice President, Corporate Audit, was named Senior Vice President of IGS, succeeding Carolan. Kessler will join Campbell’s Leadership Team and will become a corporate officer.   Kessler joined Campbell as Vice President, Corporate Audit in 2014 from Warner Music Group, where she had served as Senior Vice President, Internal Audit, and Co-Chief Compliance Officer. Before that, she co-founded and worked for the Fraud and Risk Advisory Group, a consulting firm. Earlier in her career, she served on the executive leadership team at Limited Brands. She also played a key role in helping implement the company's shared services processes and capabilities.   Kessler earned a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in accounting from Baruch College of the City University of New York. She is a certified fraud examiner and a certified information systems auditor. She is a member of the Association of Fraud Examiners, Institute of Internal Auditors and Information Systems Audit & Control Association.   Morrison said, “IGS is a critical part of our efforts to build capabilities and reduce costs to unlock the growth potential of our business. Bethmara is a strong leader with experience in running a shared services organization and implementing enterprise processes that deliver results. Her wealth of experience in strengthening capabilities, fostering talent and leading teams will be an asset to Campbell as she leads IGS to help accelerate our performance.” Did you enjoy this article?

It started when a TGV stopped after hitting the suicide victim in northern Burgandy. Rail traffic was blocked with around 20 TGV trains between Marseille and Paris delayed for an average of 4.5 hours. Movement - French police officers have been gathering throughout France as part of a movement in support of a fellow colleague who was seriously injured on the 8th October in an attack on his patrol vehicle in Essonne. Police officers gathered during the night in silence in Paris and other regions of France including Nantes, Narbonne and Nice. Arrest - A 32 year old man has been placed in police custody after being arrested at Nice airport. According to reports the man was arrested on Sunday after injuring two police officers and making terrorist threats. The man reportedly has no previous criminal record and is due to appear in  court today. Shooting - Police have opened an investigation following another shooting in Nice. A 20 year old man was getting into his car, when two hooded gunmen opened fire in the east of the city. The victim was reportedly unhurt but several bullets struck his car. Audition - Disneyland Paris is looking for professional dancers. If you want to be considered then Disney auditions will be held in Nice at the Off Jazz Centre rue Cassini on Thursday 20th October at 10 o’clock.   Cannes Goes to Mars – The Mayor of Cannes, David Lisnard, has invited 800 people to see the live landing of the Schia-parelli probe on Mars at the Palais des Festivals. Cannes played a key role in the Mars mission with components designed, assembled and tested at Thales Alenia Space in Cannes La Bocca. Doors open Wednesday at 5.30pm and a proof of address will be requested at the door. National Calais - Fourteen unaccompanied teenagers who have been living in the Calais "Jungle" were set to be reunited with relatives after being transferred to Britain on Monday, ahead of the demolition of the French migrant camp. The arrival of the children, who the Home Office interior ministry said were aged between 14 and 17 and from countries including Syria and Sudan, are due to be followed by dozens more in the coming days. They are entitled to move to Britain under EU asylum law due to their family ties to those already in the UK. But campaigners and faith leaders warned there were many more left behind who also deserved the country's help. Brexit - Paris's business district, La Defense, has launched a playful advertising campaign to lure away companies based in Britain seeking a new European base of operations following Brexit. Hoardings of a frog sporting a tie with the colours of the French flag and asking "Tired of the fogs? Try the frogs!" are to go up in the City, London's business district, as well train stations and airports in the British capital. Business Reports from the UK suggest that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Phillip Hammond is increasingly isolated in the cabinet as the government of Prime Minister Theresa May moves towards Brexit. There have been suggestions that Mr Hammond may resign although this has been denied in government circles while other reports say that ministers want the Chancellor to make a public statement giving his unequivocal support for the Prime Minister’s position on exiting the European Union. The Treasury is said to have been “sidelined” as the government prepares to trigger article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty by the end of March next year. Mr Hammond is said to favour a “soft Brexit” with Britain retaining its membership of the single market but he’s in the minority in the cabinet. The US cosmetics and beauty firm Coty is buying the British hair straightener GHD for 420 million pounds. GHD was founded by three entrepreneurs in Bradford in 2001 for 15,000 pounds. Since then,its ceramic straightening irons and hairdryers have become popular with stylists and celebrities. Coty already owns a number of leading hair care brands including Wella and Clairol. A few months ago,Coty became the world’s third largest beauty firm following a 12.5 billion dollar takeover of Procter and Gamble’s perfume,haircare and makeup business. And-Shares in Netflix have jumped by 20 percent after the video streaming firm announced better than expected subscriber numbers. Netflix says that it added another 3.2 million subscribers globally in the third quarter-far more than the 2 million expected by analysts’. In the US numbers increased by 21 percent  helping quarterly revenues rise by 31 percent to 2.29 billion dollars. In the three months to the end of September,Netflix had around 83.3 million subscribers. Sport Football-Liverpool and Manchester United played out a disappointing 0-0 draw at Anfield last night as the visitors played a defensive game that prevented Liverpool from building momentum and the chance to draw level with Manchester City at the top of the table. The Champions League is back in action tonight. Bayer Leverkusen play Spurs in Group E while CSKA host Monaco. In Group F Real Madrid host Legia Warsaw and Sporting play Borussia Dortmund. Group G pairs Brugge with Porto and Leicester against FC Copenhagen while in Group H Dinamo Zagreb play Sevilla and Lyon host Juventus. There’s a full programme in the English Championship tonight.Tune in tomorrow morning for the results. Cricket-Pakistan have beaten West Indies in the day-night Test in Dubai by 56 runs. A second innings century by Darren Bravo had given West Indies some hope of pulling off a remarkable win but it wasn’t quite enough in the end as his side were bowled out for 289-57 short of their target. Tennis-Nick Kyrgios has been banned for 8 tournament weeks and fined 25,000 dollars for his behaviour at last week’s Shanghai Masters. The Australian patted the ball over the net several times in his defeat by Mischa Zverev and walked back to his chair before his opponent’s serve had landed. He’s also agreed to an ATP plan that he see a sports psychologist.

He was 58. The cause was a heart attack, a company spokesman said. Schafer formed SCC with his roommate from the University of Iowa, Tim Condon, in 1989. "He was my college roommate, the best man at my wedding, the godfather of my son," Condon told Crain's. "He was my best friend and one of the nicest people I have ever known." Condon recalled the kindness and warmth with which Schafer treated SCC employees. When Schafer interviewed Suzanne Martineau, today an executive creative director at SCC, the meeting lasted three hours and expanded beyond a job interview to a wide-ranging discussion about life and values, according to Condon. "He always put people in front of profit," he said. Former clients with whom SCC had not worked since 1990 showed up to today's memorial service, a testament to Schafer's talent for maintaining friendships, Condon said. Schafer grew up in Roscoe, near Rockford. He began his career in 1984 on the account service side at Mandabach & Simms, a Chicago agency that focused on foodservice clients. The agency was sold to Ketchum Communications in 1987 and is today part of holding company Omnicom Group, based in New York. He moved to San Francisco and switched to the creative side of the business, working as a copywriter and creative director for brands such as Nestle before coming back to Chicago and launching SCC. West Loop-based SCC grew steadily, garnering accounts including Allen Edmonds, the Chicago Cubs, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo. Today, SCC employs more than 100 people. Schafer most recently served as COO before retiring in 2014 and assuming the chairman emeritus title. A longtime Glenview resident, Schafer and wife Katie recently purchased a farm in Lyndon Station, Wis., where they were living at the time of his death. In a statement, the agency said Mark was "a brilliant artist and creative executive" who also happened to be "a kind, calm and rock-solid individual who inspired colleagues and clients alike.” Schafer Condon Carter Advertising and Marketing Today's Crain's Get our daily roundup of important business news.

The sticks felt clinical, complete with an "active ingredient" list on the packaging. If you wanted to go wild, you could skip the tasteless "original" flavor and spring for cherry or mint. But seven years ago, pastel-colored orbs of lip balm called EOS began to pop up everywhere. They took over shelf space at Walgreens, then Walmart, then Target. Beauty editors at Cosmo and Allure couldn't get enough of the stuff, raving about flavors like honeydew and grapefruit. And then Miley Cyrus, Christina Aguilera, and Kim Kardashian were spotted whipping balls of EOS out of their makeup bags. Products from EOS—the acronym for the company's full name, Evolution of Smooth—are splashed all over beauty and fashion magazines. But the company's founders haven't spoken about their business strategy until now. In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, they told us how they created a $250 million company that has, according to consulting and research firm Kline, become the second best-selling lip balm in the country, after Burt's Bees, and outpaces Chapstick and Blistex, which have been around for far longer. Kline Research says that EOS has singlehandedly driven growth in the oral care category. It currently sells over 1 million units a week and future prospects look promising, since the global lip care market is projected to increase steadily to $2 billion by 2020, driven by demand for natural and organic products, which is EOS's speciality. "Not necessarily building up information about it was something quite deliberate on our part," Sanjiv Mehra, EOS cofounder and managing partner, explains. Mehra points out that as a small startup, they wanted to focus all their attention on creating products and distributing them. "As we've grown, we believe that it is important for consumers to know a little bit more about the business we are and the values we stand for." Rethinking The Tube Nearly a decade ago, Mehra, who had spent his career in consumer packaged-goods companies like PepsiCo and Unilever, joined forces with Jonathan Teller and Craig Dubitsky, who had spent time at startup incubators, to think about how they could shake up the beauty aisle in the drugstore. (Dubitsky left before EOS launched to manage a new oral care company called Hello Products.) The lip balm category struck them as a prime candidate for innovation, since the vast majority of products on the market "were indistinguishable" from their 100-year-old predecessor, Teller says. Many brands appeared to be driven primarily by cutting costs and competing on price, he points out. "It appeared to us that everybody in this category was being lazy. That was an opportunity." Lip balm tended to be treated as a unisex commodity, like toothpaste or shampoo. But, as they did in-depth consumer research, they found that the product was overwhelmingly used by women as part of their beauty regime. On sensory panels, users they spoke to explained that they would lose lip balm tubes in their handbags. Many liked the idea of pots of lip balm that were entering the market, but they did not like to apply it with their fingers, because it seemed unhygienic. But one of their most important findings was that they did not find applying lip balm fun or enjoyable. "The products that women depend on every day should deliver moments of delight that elevate these daily routines," Mehra says. So they set about creating a product that would be tailor-made for women's everyday experiences, using their own funds and startup capital. (They still have not taken in external investment.) They wanted to rethink the lip balm format from the ground up, so they brought in a clay artist who modeled different shapes. "We were trying to to make the product as imaginatively as possible and not create an incremental variant over what was already in market," Teller explains. Even though they were coming up with a radically different take on the lip balm concept, they didn't want to make something that would be a fad. "We had to do it in a way that was not gimmicky, so that it would stand the test of time," Mehra says. "We had to make a product and a package that would be seen as useful for a very long time." In his mind, this meant that the lip balm had to be effective and consistently pleasurable to use, not just a wacky new addition to the lip balm aisle. In they end, they decided to think about how the product would engage all five senses, from soft round packaging that felt good in the hands, to the colors of the orbs, to the smells, to the way the flavors tasted, and even to the clicking sound the sphere makes when it closes. They would price the lip balm at about $3, so that it could compete on price with all the other drugstore lip balms, but they decided to use organic ingredients. (Earlier this year, some customers who had a bad reaction to the product brought a class action lawsuit to the company, but it was quickly settled out of court and EOS was not required to change any of its ingredients.) Throughout it all, they wanted to focus on creating an emotional connection with the user, rather than being simply another commodity. So they picked the tagline, "The lip balm that makes you smile." Big Dreams But it wasn't enough to create an innovative new product. How would a startup compete in a market dominated by giants like Chapstick, which is owned by Pfizer, and Burt's Bees, which is owned by Clorox? Mehra and Teller explain that it wasn't easy getting into stores. Mehra was himself familiar with the process, and they also hired an experienced sales representative. But buyers at drugstores and chain stores didn't know what to make of this new product. Many thought that customers were creatures of habit who were loyal to their existing lip balm brand. "There were a lot of male buyers out there who would say that they didn't understand the product," Mehra says. This makes sense, since the EOS team had carefully designed the product for female users. But then they were lucky enough to get a meeting with a female buyer at Walgreens who loved the little spheres. They landed their first account with her, and after the successful launch of the product, Walmart and Target later decided to sell EOS on their shelves. This brought them to their next big hurdle: To compete with the industry leaders, they would have to scale very quickly. They decided early on to invest in their own equipment, rather than relying on a third-party manufacturer. Mehra and Teller remember going to engineering trade shows to see how they could get experts to create machinery for them. Ultimately, they managed to create a production facility that is almost entirely automated from start to finish. This has served them well, since they were able to meet the demands of every new account they landed very quickly. Marketing To Millennials Besides getting products on shelves, the cofounders wanted to create a buzz around their new product. They decided that their target audience was millennial women between the ages of 25 and 35 who were style conscious. EOS advertised in the same ways that the older brands did, through magazine and television ads, but they also became experts at influencer marketing, which they believed was a smart way to reach their demographic. They contacted beauty bloggers who reviewed the product and talked about it on YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. They worked with millennial celebrities to get the word out about the lip balm through product placements and endorsements. EOS appeared in Miley Cyrus and Britney Spears music videos, was a headline sponsor for Demi Lovato's world tour, and Taylor Swift became its Asian spokesperson. "We became the largest advertiser in our category," Teller says. EOS has also worked to build a large social media presence. It now has more than 1.8 million followers on Instagram and nearly 7 million followers on Facebook. A photograph of a new EOS flavor can get over 40,000 likes. Finally, the brand partnered with other major players on the market. It collaborated with Keds to produce an EOS shoe that came with a matching lip balm. It worked on a limited-edition holiday collection with designer Rachael Roy. It created an Alice in Wonderland collection with Disney that sold out in days and showed up on eBay for hundreds of dollars. (Some are still being sold, starting at $75.) All of this work has paid off. In seven short years, the brand emerged from an incubator to become a household product. It has even spawned a host of copycats. Blistex and Revo (made by OraLabs) have spherical lip balms that take a page from EOS's playbook, while Walgreens and Sephora have created their own iterations of it. These days, the company sells over a million lip balms a week, which is more than they sold in their entire first year in business. For all this success, the company is working hard to continue innovating. It comes up with new collections regularly, so that there is a constant stream of new products on shelves. EOS already creates shaving creams and hand lotions, but plans to enter new categories in the future. As Mehra and Teller look back, they believe that their unique backgrounds allowed them to take on a giant of their industry. Mehra, having worked at major corporations, understood the ins and outs of big business, while Teller was immersed in startup culture. Says Mehra: "That approach of using an entrepreneurial mind-set and big-company discipline is part of how we do things every day at the company."

Palmieri Pat McGrath Launches Metalmorphosis 005, Talks ‘Insane Metal Pigment’ Pat McGrath previewed her fifth Pat McGrath Labs launch, Metalmorphosis 005, an eye color kit containing four products. By Rachel Strugatz on October 18, 2016 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Pat McGrath Labs will launch Metalmorphosis 005 Nov. 15. Courtesy NEW YORK — Pat McGrath coined a new term for any metallic eye pigment she deems subpar. “What is the goldest of all gold that I can ever have in my kit? When I put a metallic [eye shadow] on I’m not looking for a local metallic…a local shadow claiming to be a metallic,” the makeup artist said Monday evening during a preview of Pat McGrath Labs’ fifth product, Metalmorphosis 005, at the Dream Hotel in Chelsea here. “That’s a new word for basic. Basic is ‘local.'” McGrath is very serious about eye shadow pigment, so much so that Metalmorphosis is an extension of her first product, the Gold 001 pigment that launched a year ago. It also marks the first time she has brought back one of her products after it has sold out. This time around, though, Gold 001 is being joined by her “sisters” silver, bronze and copper, McGrath said. Every kit comes with a cream shadow, a pigment in the same shade, a Mehron mixing liquid and a black, dual-ended liquid eyeliner (to achieve a bold or fine stroke). Each of the four Metalmorphosis 005 sets retails for $60, an Everything Kit containing all four colorways for $165, and a single Dual-Ended Marker for $24. The range will hit the makeup artist’s web site, Patmcgrath.com, on Nov. 15 and select Sephora doors and sephora.com on Nov. 22. Using her hand to test out each shade, she demonstrated that the liquid can be used to help the pigment go from dry to wet for a more saturated finish on the eye. She also suggested layering a light wash of cream shadow on the lid and then placing pigment on top, as well as applying pigment in a dramatic, winged cat-eye for a more “couture” look. For less of a statement, the product works well when brushed along the lash line as a liner or even just placed on the inner corners for a pop of metallic. It can also be used as lip, hair or body color, and mixing and matching colors is recommended. “It’s every eye I’ve ever done since I’ve started my career,” McGrath mused of the long-lasting liner and metal pigments, adding that, “[You put it on] and then you can’t get it off, I’m sorry. You can wear it for a few nights.” Metalmorphosis 005, billed as “metallurgic masterpieces,” follows the same code as her four previous launches: the makeup appeared on the runways during the most recent fashion week (in this case, the spring runways of Maison Margiela and Versace). And like each product that’s come before it, the four-piece eye set is available in limited release. McGrath, who is also the global creative design director at Procter & Gamble, is mum on numbers, but did say that production is considerably higher than when her first Gold 001 pigment came out last September. She confirmed that she started with a “very small amount” and upped production once Pat McGrath Labs partnered with Sephora on the distribution for the Skin Fetish 003 highlighting kits and Lust 004 glitter lip sets that were released on April 26 and Aug. 30, respectively. “There are no rules with labs,” she said when asked if she continued to keep up the cadence of doing five product launches a year.
