How Old-School Tactics From Emerging Economies Can Inform Local Marketing September 22, 2016 by Florian Huebner 1 Comment Filed Under: Commentary Pokémon Go took only 3 weeks to generate 75 million downloads worldwide. Marketers were quick to pounce on the phenomenon, seeing nothing but opportunity, especially for local businesses: Create a virtual Pokéstop which coincides with your bricks-and-mortar store — genius! It’s a wildly successful game, but it’s also an anomaly: You can’t expect Pikachu to do all the heavy-lifting when it comes to long-lasting local marketing strategies. Rather, there’s tremendous insight in old-school marketing tactics about to how to strengthen local digital strategies through offline expertise. Here are a few tips from a few ever-impressive emerging markets. Nigeria: Create an enormous selling-network Despite being legally restricted to their operating regions, fintechs still find local attention tough to capture. This is why Nigeria is so exciting. A 95% cash-based economy makes everyday transactions highly inefficient and insecure. Payment and transfer fintechs like Pay Attitude, Bitpesa and *737* have proliferated, benefiting from Nigeria’s deep mobile phone penetration (Pew Research estimates it’s above 90% this year). However, it’s Paga, the SMS-based payment fintech that really stands out. In a truly innovative (but old-school) local marketing move, Paga simply created the selling-network it needed. Over the past 4 years, the company has trained over 10,000 people to become Paga agents, who access the market by tapping into their existing networks. Agents are mostly established local entrepreneurs, such as shop owners, with deep local knowledge and connections. A grocery store owner could recommend his customers pay with Paga, for instance, allowing the company to provide an everyday and useful demonstration of its product. This effectively brings the market to them – evidenced in its estimated 70% reach of Nigeria’s adult population. So if you’re finding online local marketing isn’t penetrating the region you want — don’t wait for existing platforms to take your product on — create a partner network where you can both interdependently benefit. India: Respect regional differences and persuade Parts of India unfortunately still suffer from inadequate health care, with both education and resources lacking. Because of this, one challenge for the Indian branch of P&G has been to market its products to locals for whom certain healthcare products may be unfamiliar, and also possibly taboo. In a recent report by McKinsey, however, the company was able to successfully navigate cultural sensitivities, particularly when it came to women’s health. So just how did it market its Whisper brand of its sanitary products to communities where similar goods were not used before? P&G targeted local female figures of authority — including teachers and police officers — who could appropriately provide classes in schools on the subject and product. This created a word-of-mouth local success, with the campaign reaching 2 million girls in more than 150,000 schools. This not only has enormous health benefits, but creates lifelong trust in the brand; McKinsey reported that the campaign resulted in a drastic reduction in cloth-based protection from 66% to 6%. Differing from the Nigerian Paga, P&G shows that there are subtler ways to work: work with brand consultants to navigate and tailor your local marketing key messaging for different regions. China: The devil is in the details  When buying a laptop, you might just go online, read a few reviews, compare prices and buy. In China, however, customers typically make at least four trips in-store to speak with shop assistants, test the product, and compare. Through surveys, business consultancies MEC and CIC recently highlighted the changing consumption behaviors of middle-class consumers in China, noting a greater tendency towards security and safety when purchasing. They found that up to 75% of Chinese consumers are very reluctant to buy electronics online or from abroad: Not the best market for impulse products! Computer manufacturers and outlets therefore reach customers the old-school way — through TV (79% of all Chinese companies market primarily through television, according to Forbes Insights). But China has about 3,000, mostly local TV stations, meaning single national advertizing campaigns are easy to plan, but they lose impact along the way. A more successful strategy is to segment geographies to get a higher share of voice through local outlets. This also promotes the notion that a brand treats the region as a priority – something very important to Chinese consumers. Therefore, companies like Lenovo buy local TV advertising across all relevant regions, and make only tiny modifications to a single advert: Changing the location name. The lesson? Minor details have major payoffs. Locations, languages, even dialects – use these to your advantage. Brazil: Care about local distinctions In China, it’s only the advertising which is locally tailored. In Brazil, however, entire business models are. Each Brazilian region has vastly different demographics, which creates drastic differences in industry segmentation. For example, consumer packaged goods tend to be concentrated  in the Southern, more wealthy parts of the country, with McKinsey reporting that more prestigious big-box stores make up to 70% of retailing overall in Brazil, but only 55% in the North. Such demographic differences have killed off the chances of clumsy brands, but Natura, the market leader for toiletries, has thrived. Not only does it manufacture locally-sourced products, but it works closely with 32 local, sometimes-remote communities in the poorer North, to help develop the workforce and connections it requires. It has also expanded the skills of 5,000 small suppliers by providing training and partnership opportunities. Furthermore, it has carried out well-publicized sustainability campaigns which have demonstrated concern for the environment, and the lifestyles of the communities it works with, with INSEAD showing that Natura is one of the leading local companies to campaign for sustainable development. Natura shows that by tying your company to the success of the region, you create a real sense that you care about it, and belong to it. Something that benefits the company in a concrete way, as they have now expanded to markets outside of Brazil, including Europe. Make your online local marketing demonstrate that you care about where you are – use it to showcase CSR projects, and recommend regional events and successes — be a part of your location.

P&G bids beauty care adieu this week Alexander Coolidge , acoolidge@enquirer.com 4:44 p.m. EDT September 24, 2016 Christina Hendricks in a Nice 'n Easy ad. (Photo: Provided/Brian Ach) Procter & Gamble's split from 41 beauty brands is nearing completion as the consumer giant wraps up an exchange offer this week. Unknown until just before the closing of the deal: the exact structure of P&G’s split with its beauty brands. The final structure of the deal will shape Procter’s financial position and will influence future moves by the Cincinnati-based consumer product giant’s from potential acquisitions to a boost in dividends. P&G is asking existing shareholders to swap some or all of their shares for stock in the new-and-improved Coty. P&G officials won’t say how many have expressed interest. P&G says it will distribute any unsold shares in the departing beauty brands to all P&G shareholders. With the closing of the beauty divestiture, P&G will complete its massive brand divestiture announced two years ago aimed at paring 100 noncore labels. When the deal is done, P&G executives have promised their company will be smaller, easier-to-run and poised to resume growing sales and profits. Jack Russo, an analyst with Edward Jones, said the transaction will benefit both P&G, which wants to get smaller, and Coty, which wants to bulk up. "For P&G, this allows them to get rid of underperforming brands and focus their capital and resources on the best brands within their beauty business," Russo said. "Meanwhile, Coty will be able to meaningfully improve the size and scale of its beauty business with this deal." Bill Chappell, an analyst with SunTrust, said completion of the complex deal will allow P&G to get back to basics, which it has promised to do for the last two years. "Shareholders will be happy to see them reach the finish line, so they can focus on their core business," Chappell said. "P&G won't know if their plan will work until they get past this transaction." Football fans sit at the CoverGirl Nailgating booth in Minneapolis.  (Photo: AP Photo/Ann Heisenfelt) How the stock swap is supposed to work On Sept. 1, P&G opened the offer to swap P&G shares for shares that will become part of Coty. The exchange offer expires on Friday, Sept. 29, at midnight. Specifically, P&G shareholders are being offered a $1.075 worth of stock for every $1 P&G shares they tender. The final exchange ratio will be based on the volume-weighted average price of both P&G and Coty shares during the last three days of the offer this week. P&G shareholders who take the deal appear poised to get between 3.7 and 3.9 shares of Coty for every share of P&G they exchange based on both stock prices. The consumer products giant said it will issue nearly 410 million shares in Galleria, the company that will merge with Coty. Participating P&G shareholders will collectively own 54 percent of the super-sized Coty, which will have 746 million shares outstanding and a market capitalization of about $19 billion. Shareholders who have opted to trade in their P&G shares have until the last day to change their mind and cancel their transaction. P&G needs 110 million shares of company stock to complete the transaction. It's not known how shareholders are reacting to the exchange. P&G officials declined to describe interest in the offer. If too many shareholders try to swap out their stock, P&G will prorate the new stock to be issued. If P&G doesn't get enough shareholders willing to surrender their shares, P&G will distribute the unsold portion to all P&G shareholders as a one-time stock dividend. How successful P&G is in selling off Galleria to its shareholders will have a noticeable effect on the company’s finances. P&G prefers to sell all the Galleria shares in exchange for Procter shares because it will minimize taxes to shareholders, but it also preserves capital. Using the divestiture to shrink P&G’s outstanding shares saves the company money on shares repurchases – freeing up money that can be spent elsewhere on innovation, marketing, acquisitions or future dividend increases. If P&G gets enough shares tendered to cover the entire divestiture, P&G will effectively repurchase about 4 percent of its shares. P&G’s deal to sell Duracell batteries to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway was similar because that brand sale was also transacted in $4 billion worth of P&G shares – not cash. That deal reduced P&G’s outstanding shares or “float” by 2 percent. Stock exchange transactions are attractive vehicles for restructuring because the taxes are dramatically lower than all-cash deals. Cutting shares outstanding could also boost the company’s stock because earnings per share will increase. If there aren’t enough takers, P&G can still dispose of the remaining stock in the outgoing brands by distributing them to all stockholders as a one-time dividend. But such a dividend would be taxable income for shareholders. Should P&G shareholders take the deal?  Analysts say P&G shareholders have a stark choice in deciding whether to surrender some of their shares to bet on Coty. While P&G investors have seen choppy performance for nearly half a decade, the company’s stock has steadily risen this year as it approaches the latest divestiture. In contrast, Coty shares have slid in the year since the pending deal was first announced amid uncertainty over what will likely be a complex integration. Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman says Coty might be a solid investment worth enduring its transition. "Frankly, we’re a bit surprised just how under the radar Coty has been of late," Lieberman wrote in a Sept. 19 note to investors. "While there are surely many moving pieces from a technical perspective that will make the stock volatile over the coming weeks, fundamentally, we think many either under appreciate or simply are not familiar with the merits of the corporate transformation story that is unfolding." Lieberman said Coty will need to "revive" several of its beauty brands with declining sales, but was compelled the transaction creates a large beauty player that appears hungry to grow even larger. Future moves may include trimming back after the merger, but future acquisitions may also follow. Coty plans to cut $750 million worth of expenses over the next four years following the deal. "It strikes us as unequivocal that there is a growth mandate at Coty," Lieberman wrote. "We think this is just the first step in a long journey toward establishing itself as a 'challenger' in global beauty." The transformative deal will double the size of New York-based Coty, making it over as the world’s No. 3 beauty player doing $9 billion in annual sales. Coty will also add 10,000 former P&G employees and assume control of eight factories, including one in Maryland and seven in Europe. Coty, the maker of Rimmel makeup and Calvin Klein perfume, will also acquire household names, such as CoverGirl makeup, Wella and Nice 'n Easy hair coloring, and a raft of licensed fragrances. While there will be a transition period at Coty, P&G has arranged for its interested shareholders to acquire Coty shares at a 7.5 percent discount. Portfolio managers also point out for clients with too much wealth concentrated in P&G shares, this is a tax-free opportunity to diversify some of those holdings. Michael Chasnoff, president of Truepoint Capital in Blue Ash, said he's had several clients ask about the tender offer. He said Coty shares are riskier given the pending integration, but might be a smart move for some clients who need to broaden their portfolio. "Some investors have too much P&G stock – this is a tax-free way to diversify," Chasnoff said. 143 CONNECTTWEET 27 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2d7M1Dq TOP VIDEOS Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 Predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 Which stores are opening, closing Thanksgiving Day 0:34 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 Cincinnati Police Criminalist: Tensing 'seemed nervous or afraid' 2:59 Crime lab: No evidence on Tensing’s boots that he was dragged 4:07 Alternate juror in Ray Tensing trial has been dismissed 1:24 Born in Cincinnati, celebrated around the world: An anthem that unites us 3:39 Inside Prep Sports 360: Colerain Football prepares for playoffs 5:05 JP Macura looks ahead to the season 2:24

Joe Manchin hosts eastern panhandle job fair Posted: Wednesday, September 21, 2016 3:52 PM EDT Updated: Friday, October 21, 2016 3:53 PM EDT By Marla Pisciotta An estimated 100 employers were scheduled to participate in a Procter & Gamble job fair Sept. 19. U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., along with WorkForce West Virginia, was host of the job and resource fair in Martinsburg — his 10th throughout the state. “I’m excited to help with the job fair,” Manchin said. “People are getting work — we’re pleased. Employees in West Virginia are more than capable of working.” Manchin said the job fair was set up to help people with everything from improving their skillsets to helping them get interviews for employment. GetReady Resources was there to help job seekers develop their careers, and a “MilitaryZone” provided information about getting an education through military service or by attending a military service academy. A total of 100 employers were scheduled to participate. “Come, tell us what you need and we’ll show you how to get it,” Manchin said in an interview Sept. 16 from his office in Washington, D.C. Procter & Gamble, Macy’s, and state and federal agencies such as the IRS were scheduled to participate. Procter & Gamble is in the process of constructing a new, massive manufacturing plant on nearly 450 acres of land in Tabler Station Business Park in Martinsburg. The Berkeley County facility will be the company’s second new plant in the United States since 1971. P&G’s initial investment in the project is $500 million. It is the fifth-largest consumer product company in the world, as well as the second largest in the United States. It is ranked 26 on the Fortune 500 list. The plant is projected to open in 2017.  This story first appeared in the print edition of The State Journal. Click HERE to subscribe.

Since its first shipment of Head & Shoulders shampoo in the country in 1991, P&G has won the trust and confidence of Pakistani consumers through the introduction of premium quality brands and sustained investments in the community, industry and human resource. Sharing his thoughts on this milestone, Sami Ahmed, Vice President, P&G Pakistan, said: “This is truly a historic occasion and a moment of great pride for P&G as we celebrate 25 years of successful operations in Pakistan. Through these years we have remained steadfast in our purpose to touch and improve the lives of Pakistan consumers. We’ve launched some of our world-renowned brands such as Pampers, Always, Safeguard, Head & Shoulders and Pantene which have since then become a special part of consumers’ everyday lives and therefore are amongst leading household names in their categories. Through our business growth, we have invested in the country by building factories and a strong supply base. This has led to the creation of thousands of jobs directly and indirectly. We are also improving lives of the community with programs like P&G Children’s Safe Drinking Water, Pampers Hospital Education Program and Mobile Clinics, as well as Safeguard and Always School programs.” He further added, “Pakistan is an important market for P&G. With a large, growing population, high urbanization, highly young population and evolving retail landscape, the country offers a significant consumer base with huge potential. We’re poised for future growth in Pakistan and look forward to celebrating many more milestones here in the years ahead.” For 25 years, P&G has continued to touch and improve the lives of millions of Pakistanis in meaningful ways, through premium quality brands, impactful social cause programs and the development of local skills.

David | @TeflonGeek Sunday, 25 Sep 2016 | 9:57 AM ETCNBC.com SHARES Adam Jeffery | CNBC Former President Bill Clinton sits down with CNBC's Becky Quick the Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting in New York on Sept. 20, 2016. Ex-president Bill Clinton has been campaigning furiously to promote the candidacy of his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as she takes on GOP candidate Donald Trump. In addressing a wide range of subjects with CNBC last week, Clinton touched on the growing scrutiny that his family foundation has drawn on the campaign trail. The former president says some of the criticism is "bull," but acknowledged that certain questions would be legitimate if Hillary Clinton wins the White House. He also told CNBC of the pointed advice he gave his wife as voter anger with the political status quo boils over. Read the full exchange between Bill Clinton and CNBC's Becky Quick here: "The stuff that they've said so far is just bull, but if [Hillary Clinton] was actually the president, it would raise too many questions. I think it's fair." -Bill Clinton, former president Quick: Scott, thank you very much. Good afternoon to everyone. Like to introduce our guest today, our special guest, former president bill Clinton. We are here at the CGI. Mr. President, thank you very much for taking the time with us today. This is the 12th CGI, the 12th annual meeting here. This is the last one. Why don't you talk about why this is the last one. Clinton: Well, I think that if Hillary wins the election, it would be impossible to do it because the CGI won't run—the whole idea of it is it's a government business, non-governmental organization, labor partnership, and, you know, it says that we just all work together. The economics of it won't work unless there are corporate sponsorships and unless we can have people from all over the world here. I learned that already in this election that some people were just subject to a presumption of guilt just because they were participating, and to be fair, a lot of times the political press, they have no previous exposure to the way we work even though we've done it for years and made everything public. We disclose everything. Who is giving, what they're doing, and all that. I think that it would be better—I think we've already changed philanthropy. That is, I think more and more people now think instead of just giving money, they should actually make a commitment to specifically do something. I can think about lots of examples. Proctor & Gamble has now given out 10 billion, billion, water tablets that purify water for a family of three for about three days. Beckton Dickinson work on many things has helped develop supply chains with other business partners. A couple of years ago they organized the first hundred tons of medical supplies to the Ebola countries. We had a very unusual commitment with bankers and other people in finance in Detroit to redo the normal mortgage system so we could get people's mortgages on homes in Detroit where the homes are in good shape, but need repair, and the value is driven down because the neighborhood because everybody was out, so they can't get a mortgage, one mortgage, that covers it. We worked hard to do that. There are lots of things like that we've done that require partnerships, and i just think that, you know, it's going to be hard to continue to keep that going. The good news is more and more people are trying to do it, which is what I dreamed of in the beginning. Quick: But it will be hard to continue to do that because you don't want to be asking people for favors as the husband of a president. Clinton: That's correct. And it's fine to do something, you know, all former presidents have foundations and they raise funds. If they were just individual contributions, you could report them every three months. The public could decide. If you —if the very model itself requires international as well as domestic support, then I think it's just —you don't want a private operation doing that if Hillary is the president. I mean, presidents can do that. President Obama and President Bush before him and me, they did public-private partnerships all the time, but nothing on the scale of CGI, and I hope it's a trend toward the future. I think it works better when we recognize that there are always going to be things that the government can't provide and the private sector can't produce and that a group like this working together can do something faster, cheaper, better, but it can't be generated from somebody like me who is outside government but whose wife may be in it. Quick: Because, obviously, people would look at you as a conduit to getting through to... Clinton: Yeah. The stuff that they've said so far is just bull, but if she was actually the president, it would raise too many questions. I think it's fair. Brian Snyder | Reuters President Barack Obama descends the stairs of Air Force One with Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton after arriving prior to a campaign event in Charlotte, North Carolina, July 5, 2016. Quick: You are stepping down from the foundation, but Chelsea is not at this point. She seems to me to be a conduit who would essentially get through to Hillary Clinton too. Clinton: We all know people but when they made that conduit argument the state department said there's nothing to it. The career people at the state department. I think it's quite different if you have the—if the foundation is operating in America taking no corporate contributions, only individual contributions, and disclosing them every three months, as we do now and confining ourselves basically to health and education and service work. We are doing some—we got to finish some of our projects. Our foundation has the largest private infrastructure program in the country where public employee unions are putting in $16 billion to promote building other things that are part of the La Guardia airport improvement, and in the first $12.5 billion that they've spent, more than 100,000 jobs have been created. I kind of think people don't want to stop that. There's not any kind of conflict between the public interest and that, but we do—we are going to give up—I'm going to get off the board. We're going to give up corporate contributions and the individual contributions will be reported on a regular basis. Chelsea has to decide what she's going to do, but somebody has to stay there, as i explained when i said we were going to get out of most of our—almost everything we're doing overseas, or everything, that somebody has to superintend the handing off of all this. We're going set up some of these things as individual foundations without any of our being involved. We're going to transfer the operations to others—to other operations. We're just going to terminate, finish the commitments we've made in some cases. That takes some time to do. You just can't —here's no way in the world—we've got a couple thousand people working for us around the world, and we owe them something. They did great work. Quick: Mr. President, let me ask you about some of the news of the day. Particularly some of the news that our viewers care about. The Federal Reserve is meeting today. We expect an announcement tomorrow about whether they will raise rates or not. And as someone who has studied the economy so closely, do you think our economy here in the United States today warrants interest rates being near 0%? Clinton: well, because Hillary is a candidate, I would be happy to offer an opinion if she weren't a candidate. But I think it would be wrong to do so because she is. However, I will say this. Janet Yellen, Lael Brainard, whom I know, several others—these are really smart people and they'll do what they think is right. And i think the political emphasis is overrated because I think whatever happens is if that they think is right economically will be manageable economically at this point. But it's been a perplexing time. There was a very long tail on this financial crash that explains most of the road rage in the American electorate and much around the world. And so, we just finally had one good year-on-year report on rising per capita income. 5.2 percent. And family incomes. About 2.5, I think. So what they'll do is they'll look at that in the long-term numbers, and they'll see whether they could actually if they've got longer term growth, would it actually help to tick up interest just a tad, or should they leave it where it is because in spite of the growth figure, the jobs figures are not still robustly growing so much. They got more data than i do. I trust them to make the decision. Quick: let me ask you about trade because that's been a huge topic in this election. We actually spoke with Donald Trump last week on CNBC. Here's what he said about NAFTA. He said, "NAFTA is the worst trade deal ever made. Not in this country, but in the history of the world. NAFTA is a one-way street into Mexico and other places." What do you say to that? Fabrizio Bensch | Reuters Consumer rights activists take part in a march to protest against the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) in Berlin, Germany, September 17, 2016. Clinton: Well, we gained manufacturing jobs when I was president. And we gained 22.7 million jobs. And Mexico has prospered. And between 2010 and 2014, although Mr. Trump kept saying we needed the wall, there was no net in migration from Mexico. Mexico is our third biggest trading partner. And until their economy kind of took a little bit of a nose dive after 2014, there was no net in migration because they could support themselves, and they were trying to be good neighbors. Products we import from Mexico have about 40 percent American contributed content. Products we import from china have about 4 percent. So, i think it's a little more complicated than he says. And I think the real NAFTA problem, I mean, the real Mexican problem, is not NAFTA. Look at what happened to carrier. They moved that furnace plant down there. I think that was bad. But that's because of American corporate culture and law and practice. For example, the carrier plants—we're going to move this furnace plant down to Mexico. Well, is the division making money today? Yes. $2.9 billion. Well, are the profit margins going down? No, the profit margins are going up. We're still going to move it down there. Well, the union offered to save you the same amount of money you'll get going down there. They said, you know, we'll change our work rules, we'll save it. Leave the jobs here. No, we want to move it down there. Why? Because of activist investors who demand a profit in a year and a day, and the management who are paid by that. You know, there was a gripping eyewitness report on the board meeting about what happened. That's not NAFTA. That's not running a stakeholders society. We need to go from a shareholder—or at least a top shareholder to a stakeholder society as we once were. And we need the incentives to do that. And if we do that, we'll make better decisions. And we're going to have to trade some because we're only 4 percent of the world's people. We like having 20 percent of the world's income or so. And I think, you know, we got to have the right kind of trade deals. But if you enforce the trade deals and you do it right, they can be positive. The one thing I would say that I learned, though, besides the enforcement issue is both parties, in different ways, let the working people down that wound up being displaced even if they—some they knew they would be, some they didn't. Because people say, oh, well, the market will take care of that. We know better than that. It's not easy to replace jobs lost in southern West Virginia when coal plants close, for example. The last major legislation designed to deal with that was the new markets tax credit I signed. And it is still working. The mayor of Cincinnati told me the other day he was getting some jobs out of it. But we need, as Hillary has called for, a much bigger tax credit and set of incentives for people to invest in areas where there's been trade dislocation, or the economy has moved away, or they're too far away like Native American reservations with no gambling. And we got a lot of work to do on that. I think that America would feel much more comfortable in trading if we thought everybody was going to be taken care of. We have done a poor job of dealing with the people who got the short end of the stick. We've got to do better. Quick: We're going to continue this conversation with President Clinton. Talk a little bit more about trade. Also talk about the Wells Fargo hearing that's been taking place on Capitol Hill. But Scott, I know that you all are eager to get back to that Congressional hearing that's taking place, too. Again, we will bring you more of this conversation a little bit later, but right now, Scott, we'll send it back over to you. Javier E.

Home > News By Company > Future Market Insights Tweet   Releases New Report on the BRICS Disposable Hygiene Products Market Future Market Insights has announced the addition of the Disposable Hygiene Products Market: BRICS Industry Analysis and Opportunity Assessment 2014-2020" report to their offering.   (EMAILWIRE.COM, September 25, 2016 ) The disposable hygiene products market is witnessing an annual growth of nearly 6-7% due to increased consumer spending on personal care products globally. In addition, the demand for improvised comfort, performance and efficient absorbent hygiene products is expected to drive demand for disposable hygiene products in the near future. Concerns for safety, convenience and hygiene are identified as key factors affecting growth of disposable hygiene products market. Furthermore, rising consumption of products such as sanitary pads, wipes, baby products and others across the globe is anticipated to drive demand for disposable hygiene products market in near future. Among the developing economies, increasing population and manufacture of such products in countries such as India and China and low penetration of these products is expected to open opportunities for growth of the market in BRICS. Moreover, industry-sophistication is expected to fuel the demand for disposable hygiene products in Brazil. Apart from increasing population in BRICS, economic development particularly in countries such as China and India is a key factor contributing towards substantial growth of disposable hygiene products market in the region. Furthermore, increasing disposable income, rising expenditure or consumer spending on personal hygiene and increasing hygiene concerns are expected to fuel demand for disposable hygiene products over the next five to six years. Also, increasing Internet penetration is a prime factor supporting wide distribution of these products to tech-savvy consumers in BRICS via the medium of online retailing. Internet penetration is expected to enhance distribution of these products, leading to increased consumption and brand visibility among consumers in BRICS. Request Free Report Sample@ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-br-107 Although hygiene concerns rank high among consumers in the BRICS region, low awareness among people in rural areas coupled with low adoption of products in regular operations could hamper growth of the market. However, some international companies are focused on advertising campaigns along with the government awareness campaigns regarding hygiene. Although hygiene concerns in BRICS region is high, low awareness among people in rural areas coupled with low adoption of products on a regular basis is expected to restrict market growth. Moreover, cost reduction coupled with efficient packaging of the disposable hygiene products is concern for companies operating in this market. As a result, a few international companies are focusing on advertising campaigns along with product portfolio expansion through opening of new manufacturing units. For instance, Unicharm Corporation, Procter & Gamble India and Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget SCA (publ.) among others, have opened new manufacturing units for hygiene products in India. For instance, Unicharm Corporation invested US $ 39.2 million to set up a manufacturing facility with the objective to develop baby care, pet care and feminine care products in India. The disposable hygiene products market is segmented on the basis of product type and material used in products. The various disposable hygiene products include nappies, diapers, toilet paper, wipes, sanitary protection, kitchen towels, paper tableware, cotton pads and buds. These products are classified according to age-group since product usage differs accordingly. On the basis of age-group, the market has been segmented into adult care, feminine care and baby care. The materials used in these products are broadly classified as woven or non-woven, which depends on the acceptability of the product as well as age-group for which they are designed. Among all the product categories, the sanitary pads and baby products are collectively expected to be a promising area in the BRICS disposable hygiene products market. Among all the BRICS countries, India and China are expected to witness an increase in demand for disposable hygiene products, followed by Brazil and Russia.

Doc: Life, living are different roads Paul Daugherty , pdaugherty@enquirer.com 12:38 p.m. EDT September 24, 2016 Buy Photo Ken Schappell (Photo: The Enquirer/Paul Daugherty)Buy Photo “I’m blessed I’ve got a death sentence.’’ • Ken Schappell He’s up at 3 in the morning working out and a few hours later, he’s walking 2 ½ miles to the local McDonald’s. It gives him time to look at the stars. “Have you ever really looked at the stars?’’ he asks. Ken Schappell is a 57-year-old man who had everything and lost it in an instant. Now he’s getting it all back, and more, with no time to spare. A few of us come to perspective naturally. The rest of us have it forced upon us. On April 26, doctors told Ken he had a Grade 4 glioblastoma: A fatal brain tumor. He went from being high up in the Procter & Gamble corporate food chain to being unable to button his shirt, in a matter of minutes. The diagnosis was equally swift. “Looks like you have multiple tumors,’’ the neurologist said. Now, Ken wakes up and wonders, “If today is the last day, what should I do?’’ Ken doesn’t look sick. His workout regimen would shame a much younger man: Two hours on the elliptical machine, 30 minutes of lifting light free weights. He has lost some hair and some of the use of his left side. His coffee is a safe distance across the table, lest the cancer make him clumsy. He’s five minutes at the drive-thru ATM and some days he can’t tie his shoes. “I look pretty normal,’’ Ken says, “but I’m dying.’’ Best case is two to three years. Worst case is six months. By any physical measure, he is losing. But oh, what he has won. I know him because I know his son. Kevin Schappell was a basketball star at Loveland High School and Northern Kentucky University. He worked for Bob Huggins at West Virginia, before returning to NKU, to assist Dave Bezold, where he met Jillian Daugherty and became her friend for life. Jillian is my daughter, born with Down syndrome. She managed the men’s basketball team at NKU, when Kevin coached there. He welcomed her into the basketball brotherhood and made her feel special. She showed him that life can be a non-stop joy. Kevin and Jillian became co-conspirators in a happiness plot. We change each other’s lives. That’s the beauty of collaboration. Some reasons to love sports are obvious: The competition, the rivalries, the need to belong. Others are subtle: Memories and connections, mostly. And the ties that bind a basketball star to his developmentally disabled friend. And their mutual connection: The dad that influenced it all. Ken Schappell is chasing meaning as his days dwindle. He wants lots of things, not with a hot impatience, but rather a quiet urgency. They are essential things that those of us who are well so often assume: “I want to be nicer to people,’’ he says. “I ask people how their day is going. I want to be more generous.’’ And he wants a forever connection with his three kids, Kristina, Jessica and Kevin. “I want to tell them everything I’ve learned, and I know I don’t have time to do it.’’ So Ken asks them, “Tell me what you would like to know.’’ “We all have a death sentence,’’ he says. “Mine’s a little more certain. That certainty is a blessing.’’ Kevin was maybe 7 or 8 when he decided he wanted to play basketball. Soon enough, Ken put the hoop in the driveway. Over the years, it became the adhesive for their relationship. “Let’s go shoot, Dad,’’ meant, “Dad, I need you to rebound.’’ “I became the world’s best rebounder,’’ Ken says. They talk every morning now. Friday’s discussion touched on what each would miss, when Ken is gone. “Kev says, ‘I want Wesley to have the kind of relationship with you that I do’,’’ Ken recalls. Wesley is Kevin’s 22-month-old son. He will have Kevin’s memories. “Grandpa was a great rebounder. . .’’ Ken has time to do what he wants and half a million frequent flier miles to do it. He and his wife Karen have been to Las Vegas twice since his diagnosis. He has hiked the Smokies with Kristina, been to Indianapolis with Jessica. He’s going to the LSU-Florida football game with Kevin in a few weeks. “The nice thing about my condition is, I’ve been given six months to do all this,’’ Ken says. Still he wonders, “why wait ‘til a diagnosis to do these things?’’ Life and living are two different roads. The former is our path. The latter is how we navigate it. Ken says he has always told his kids how he felt about them. Now he wants to give them that same opportunity. Maybe what Ken doesn’t realize is, Kevin offers that tribute already, every time he’s kind to Jillian. Kindness isn’t innate. It’s inherited. “Jillian has a friend for life,’’ is what Ken says about that. On Sunday, Jillian and her husband Ryan will watch the Bengals play the Broncos. At Kevin’s house. 923 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORE TOP VIDEOS Lorenzo's Locks: Week 11 NFL picks 1:59 Punting tips and dance moves with Marquette King 1:00 Reflecting on Tony Stewart's legacy in NASCAR 2:52 A timeline of Johnny Manziel’s troubled history 2:02 Fighters square off at UFC Fight Night 100 faceoffs 1:14 Mets pitcher Jeurys Familia pleads not guilty to domestic violence charge 0:50 Pre-fight facts for UFC Fight Night 100: Bader vs. Nogueira 2 0:42 The Dallas Cowboys aren't just America's team 2:44 Three key NFL story lines to watch in Week 11 2:15 Carmelo Anthony at odds with Phil Jackson 2:09 Top five college football games to watch in Week 12 2:21 Mike Tirico to call four NFL games in place of Al Michaels 1:13 Tony Romo breaks silence on Dak Prescott, Cowboys' QB situation 4:57 Will the national anthem be booed in Mexico City? 2:41 LeBron James' view of Phil Jackson has changed 1:37 Jared Goff will make first start for Los Angeles Rams 0:49 NFL playoff picture after Week 10 1:23 Who's better?

A study undertaken by Magnetic, the marketing agency for magazine media in the UK, in partnership with media agency Carat, used the latter's Integrated Communications Evaluation (ICE) approach to look at the impact of magazine media assets across both print and digital, including display and advertorial and native solutions. This found that online magazine media was 41% more effective at delivering brand KPIs such as purchase consideration, purchase intention and recommendation, than other online environments. The ability to drive associations of quality and relevance for brands was also particularly strong for magazine media, building on their trusted environment and credible content, the study added. Separate research conducted by Magnetic with digital analytics company Moat, produced similar findings, with Magnetic member sites found to have an interaction rate 18% higher compared to other online environments, with interaction times 30% higher. Major advertisers are well aware of the potential value of magazines. On the other side of the world, Procter & Gamble has also been extolling the virtues of magazine brands, a spokesperson telling Ad News that "a strong media brand is incredibly valuable to advertisers as it has strong connection and trust with its readers and the power to influence them and encourage trial". They added: "We've seen great success in partnering with print and magazine brands on bespoke campaigns to drive trust and advocacy of our brand benefits and promise." When Magnetic looked in more depth at the ways advertisers can work with magazine media, it found that campaigns with both display and advertorial or native activity were 20% more impactful on brand KPIs than those with purely display. "Magazines achieve deep human connections with their audiences, leading to a more attentive consumer who is more open to commercial messaging and more inclined to trust what they discover there," said Sue Todd, CEO of Magnetic. "In an age of adblocking and declining receptivity to advertising, this is a powerful environment for brands."  Data sourced from Magnetic, Ad News; additional content by Warc staff Read more from Warc: Media Planning Toolkit: Planning magazine media Millward Brown on why salience isn’t everything - and magazines still matter Newsbrands and the multiplier effect Register for a trial Sign up for news A daily bulletin for marketers Related News Facebook faces new heat on metrics Supermarkets drive Aussie mag growth Social performance is on the rise Other top stories How should marketers define creativity?

The celebrations, held under the slogan, ‘Our Heroes are in Our Hearts’, displayed the love and gratitude of the citizens for the Saudi soldiers safeguarding the country’s borders and for their sacrifices to ensure the Kingdom’s security and safety. Aiming to bring joy to the shoppers, the National Day activities included traditional folklore dances such as Al-Ardah Al-Najdiya and Al-Mizmar, which were performed by various local groups at the HyperPanda stores. Each store in the three cities put up a wall displaying the picture of a Saudi soldier saluting the Saudi flag. Next to the wall a flagpole with a Saudi flag was erected to highlight the values of patriotism and national identity. Shoppers took souvenir photos while Panda staff in all the three stores wore T-shirts with the slogan ‘Our Heroes are in Our Hearts’ printed on them to express their solidarity with the soldiers protecting the borders and enhance the citizenship values in shoppers. On the occasion, miniature flags and balloons were handed out as gifts to families and kids. As part of the celebrations, a new Guinness World Record was set for the largest number of people contributing to a rubber stamp image at the HyperPanda Al Andalus Mall branch in cooperation with Ismail Ali Abudawood Trading Company Limited (IATCO) and Procter & Gamble (P&G)’s Tide brand. The event featured a 4mx2m stamping wall at the HyperPanda mall bearing the map of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on which participants put colorful stamps. “I would like to congratulate the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman Bin Abdulaziz, the Crown Prince and Deputy Crown Prince and the Saudi people on the occasion of the 86th National Day. May the blessing of security last forever and may Allah the Almighty guide our government to always serve Islam and our Kingdom,” said Muwaffaq Mansour Jamal, Chief Executive Officer, Panda Retail Company. “This is a momentous occasion during which we remember the heroic acts of the late King Abdulaziz Bin Abdulrahman Al Saud, the founder of the Kingdom. It is an occasion that commemorates the unification of the Kingdom,” Jamal added. “We hold the National Day close to our hearts and celebrate it annually as part of our national duty and in line with our sense of responsibilities. We want to give citizens and expatriates, young and old, a great opportunity to observe this day with joy and showcase the Saudi national pride on this occasion. This is also an opportunity to display how proud Panda staff members are of their nationality and their beloved country.” He said this year’s celebrations were held under the slogan, ‘Our Heroes are in Our Hearts’ to emphasize that the citizens are standing by the Saudi soldiers on the borders. “Our country is safe and secure by the grace of Allah the Almighty and the efforts of our government and heroes on the borders,” he pointed out. On this day, the value of loyalty, entrenched in the citizens and the brave soldiers, is clearly manifested. The heroic acts of our soldiers will always be remembered and appreciated, he added. Various segments of the society took part in the celebrations in huge numbers to express their pride for the country and the brave soldiers. — SG TAGS HyperPanda Jeddah Saudi National Day SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleYemen plans UN complaint over Iran weapons transfers Next articleCambridges touch down in Canada Sadiq Hussain RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR IISJAA-IFPL makes rousing start Saudi Arabian Airlines announces the appointment of a new CEO of Saudia Air Transport Company (Saudia) Worker dies in accident at Haramain Train project site NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply November 2016 S M T W T F S « Oct       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30   STAY CONNECTED 1,486,162FansLike 41,111FollowersFollow Ads Recent Posts Deterrent for non-recurrence Nov 18, 2016 Sexual harassment Nov 18, 2016 Women in Riyadh feel more at ease without niqab Nov 18, 2016 American couple ruin stereotypes about Saudis Nov 18, 2016 Saudi Arabia set to reinforce its climate change commitments Nov 18, 2016 Archives November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 © Saudi Gazette 2015 All rights reserved.

Instead, it is common among companies to earmark a portion of sales for a cause. Procter & Gamble's Shiksha programme, for instance, endeavours to do only this by urging consumers to buy its products.  Some others such as Hindustan Unilever (HUL) have fused the brand and cause together in its bid to project what Unilever Global Chief Executive Officer Paul Polman has repeatedly said: "Brands with a purpose". So, handwashing and Lifebuoy, for instance, go hand in hand. So does Brooke Bond Red Label and brotherhood. The latter association had culminated in the transgender band called '6 Pack Band', which won the Glass Grand Prix at the Cannes Advertising Festival this year.  In Nestle's case, however, popular taglines such as '2 minutes', which appears below the Maggi brand name on a pack will now be '2 minutes for education'. Similarly, KitKat's 'Take a Break. Have a KitKat' will be 'Take No Break for Education'. While Nescafe's 'It All Starts with a Nescafe' will be 'It All Starts with Education'. The company will run this initiative for two months during the festive period and is expected to push this aggressively in its bid to improve sales for the cause. Brand experts say companies will increasingly begin thinking out-of-the-box when it comes to CSR. "There is an element of seriousness to CSR now, partly because it is mandatory and second, companies have evolved when it comes to brand communication. Having a social purpose is now considered critical to a brand's DNA," says Harish Bijoor, CEO, Harish Bijoor Consults.  Tata Tea's 'Jaago Re' or Havell's 'Hawa Badlegi' are other examples of how brands are now aligning to a cause at a more serious level. Jaago Re, for instance, asking people to vote, pushing specifically for categories, such as women and youth, to cast their ballot during elections. Havell's, on the other hand, has been consistently pushing for a 'change in mindset' through its commercials, at times even landing in a controversy. An ad about the issue of reservation in education by Havell's earlier this year was panned for touching a sensitive chord. Brands are slowly but steadily understanding the merits of cause marketing.  Advertisement << Previous Article   «Back Most Read Demonetisation: Get Rs 2,000 cash at petrol pumps from Nov 18 ATMs in small cities, villages will take weeks to be ready Modus Operandi: How black money hoarders are trying to escape I-T lens Tata Trusts get I-T notice for tax avoidance Ratan Tata should step down for crisis to abate: 6 suggestions from NYU's Damodaran More From Companies Mawana sells Titawi for Rs 375 cr to Indian Potash So you think you can hack?

Energy was the worst performing major S&P sector, dropping 1.3 percent. Oil prices tumbled 4 percent on signs that Saudi Arabia and Iran were making little progress on a bilateral agreement ahead of talks by crude exporters aimed at freezing production. Facebook shares fell 1.6 percent and were one of the biggest drags on the S&P 500. The Wall Street Journal reported that the social media company overestimated viewing times for video ads. Even so, the S&P 500 recorded its best weekly performance in more than two months. Stocks were given a boost on Wednesday when the US Federal Reserve decided to keep rates steady, leaving intact the low-interest-rate environment that has helped fuel the bull market. “I just think after a few strong days and a little weakness in energy that folks are taking some profit before the weekend,” said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager with Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, Texas. “I just feel like the market is going to keep grinding higher.” The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 131.01 points, or 0.71 percent, at 18,261.45, the S&P 500 lost 12.49 points, or 0.57 percent, to 2,164.69 and the NASDAQ Composite dropped 33.78 points, or 0.63 percent, to 5,305.75. For the year, the benchmark S&P 500 is up about 6 percent. With the highly anticipated Fed decision now past, investors are turning toward the upcoming corporate earnings season and US presidential election, with the first debate tomorrow. “We have a lot of noise coming in with the end of the quarter and the debate,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. “But given what the Fed has done, I think we have volatility with a bias to the upside.” Nine of 11 major S&P sectors ended lower. The tech sector fell about 1 percent, with Apple shares down 1.7 percent on concerns about iPhone sales. Twitter Inc shares surged 21 percent on reports that the microblogging company had initiated talks with several technology companies to explore selling itself. Google parent Alphabet Inc ended unchanged, while Salesforce dropped 5.6 percent after both were reported to have shown interest in buying Twitter. Oil-linked stocks retreated, with petroleum prices, as Halliburton Co shed 1.9 percent and ConocoPhillips declined 2.6 percent. Dow member Procter & Gamble Co (P&G) fell 1.4 percent following a report from Bloomberg News that said P&G brands in skin care and men’s shaving were losing US market share to competitors. Yahoo Inc sank 3.1 percent following the Thursday disclosure that hackers took data on at least 500 million users, one of the biggest thefts of personal data ever. Marriott International Inc shed 1.9 percent after announcing it completed its US$13.6 billion takeover of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. Endo International PLC shares jumped more than 15 percent after the drugmaker announced a new chief executive. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.13-to-1 ratio; on NASDAQ, a 1.67-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted seven new 52-week highs and one new low; the NASDAQ Composite recorded 88 new highs and 13 new lows. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1235 times. Comments will be moderated.

How well his strategy works may say a lot about the future of specialty retailing amid competition from Amazon and shoppers’ abandonment of suburban malls. Share story By Matt Townsend Bloomberg News Dave Brandon has been inside a Toys R Us in Secaucus, N.J., for all of five minutes before he spots a problem. At the entrance, there’s a display of small cardboard bins filled with $1 playthings that look messy, and even worse — cheap. “It kind of reminds me of a garage sale,” says Brandon, who became chief executive officer of the world’s biggest toy chain 14 months ago. “We’re not the dollar shop. We’re a toy store.” In the Star Wars section nearby, a Chewbacca chair has tumbled over into the aisle. The 64-year-old CEO grabs it and turns it right-side up. Toys R Us at a glance Founded: 1948 in Washington, D.C. Headquarters: Wayne, N.J. CEO: David Brandon. Number of stores: 864 (Toys R Us and Babies R Us) in the U.S., more than 755 international stores Annual workforce: 62,000 2015 sales: $11.8 billion 2015 loss: $130 million Current debt: about $5 billion Sources: Toys R Us, Bloomberg Dressed in black pants and a blue long-sleeve shirt — a deliberate attempt to connect with store workers by wearing their uniform — Brandon then walks through a display of Pokémon toys, snapping pictures of empty shelves with his iPhone that he’ll send to one of his executives. It’s Friday afternoon before the crucial weekend rush.

There hasn’t been much to smile about at Toys R Us. More than a decade after a $7.5 billion leveraged buyout by Bain Capital, KKR & Co. and Vornado Realty Trust, the retailer remains saddled with annual interest payments approaching $500 million and no clear path for its owners to exit the investment. The company registered for an initial public offering in 2010, only to withdraw it a few years later. Since the buyout, Amazon.com — which once ran the Toys R Us website until the two companies’ partnership failed in 2006 — has become a powerful competitor. And shoppers are abandoning the suburban malls that helped make the big-box pioneer one of the most dominant retailers of the 1980s and 1990s. Brandon, who oversaw a turnaround at Domino’s Pizza last decade, knows he has no easy task. For years, the Wayne, N.J.-based toy chain has bought time by refinancing its debt, which now totals about $5 billion. It did so again last month with a swap that pushed out maturities on notes due in 2017 and 2018 by five years. While Brandon’s first year has brought signs of progress, with holiday sales gaining for the first time in four years, the debt deal wasn’t necessarily a full vote of confidence because many investors had bought the bonds at distressed levels and made a profit. But it did buy Brandon more time — probably the next two Christmas seasons — to turn the company around. Empty shelves Back in the Secaucus store, Brandon is looking over several empty shelves. He ticks off a list of retail basics, such as improved inventory management, that are sorely needed. Then he boils down the company’s woes to one fundamental problem: The experience needs to be more fun. The big-box advantages of selection and price that made the format so successful have been obliterated by the web. There needs to be more reasons for people to go to a store. “The biggest change you are going to see over the next year is that we want to bring our toy stores to life,” Brandon says. “I want kids to be dragging their parents to our stores because they want to see what’s going on at Toys R Us this weekend.” How well Brandon’s strategy works may say a lot about the future of specialty retailing. If any big-box chain can transform itself into an experiential destination, it’s Toys R Us. The retailer has a huge inherent advantage — kids already love the place.  It will be a massive undertaking. The company has almost 600 stores in the U.S. and 700 more overseas. It still racks up almost $12 billion in annual sales — about 10 percent from the internet — and employs 62,000 workers. The retailer generates more revenue than Under Armour, Lululemon Athletica and Chipotle Mexican Grill combined. Brandon’s plan is under way in the run-up to the holiday season, when the retailer generates 40 percent of its revenue and all its operating income. Whether it’s letting shoppers fly drones or take target practice with a Nerf blaster, all the changes Toys R Us is implementing or considering recall an era when retail was more theater than science. Apple is doing it well today, and Brandon says Toys R Us can do the same. The company is also testing video screens, sound effects and colorful motion-sensor lights, and unboxing more toys in play areas. It’s also hosting more events, such as Pokémon trading and birthday celebrations. “I want kids to come in here and not know where to go next because there are so many things going on,” says Brandon, who has seven young grandchildren. Toys R Us is also doing more to highlight major brands. Mattel’s American Girl will have its own department with dedicated staff. The chain is revamping how it treats Barbie, Mattel’s biggest line, by putting everything it sells for the brand in one place. The retailer used a similar strategy last Christmas for Star Wars. Cash has been a concern since the 2005 buyout, making it harder for Toys R Us to invest in its stores. Brandon says the retailer has the resources it needs and will keep capital expenditures where they’ve been, at about $250 million a year. In addition to the debt swap, Toys R Us is working with lenders on refinancing $725 million in real-estate-backed debt due in December 2017. The company has bought itself about 20 months before it needs to have a plan in place for $1.2 billion in loans due in 2019, according to Noel Hebert, a senior U.S. credit analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Similar situation Brandon has been in a similar spot before. In 1999, he became CEO of debt-laden Domino’s, which had recently been acquired by Bain for about $900 million. In an 11-year reign, he took the company public after boosting sales and profit, and led a bold and successful marketing campaign in 2009 that admitted that Domino’s pizza tasted awful. The company, where Brandon remains chairman, has a market value of $7 billion. Now Bain Capital has turned to Brandon once again. Joining Toys R Us returns the executive to running a large company and gives him a chance at redemption after a rocky tenure in his most-recent stint. In the early 1970s, Brandon played on the defensive line for the University of Michigan football team under legendary football coach Bo Schembechler. It was Schembechler who then served as a reference for Brandon when he landed a job after graduation at Procter & Gamble. After Domino’s, he returned to his alma mater as athletic director in 2010. In one of the few setbacks of his career, Brandon resigned less than four years later amid a string of bad publicity, including raising student ticket prices. At Toys R Us, Brandon’s growth plan includes obvious strategies like boosting online sales, which hit $1.3 billion last year. He also wants to open more stores. And not just in a fast-growing economy like China, but also in the U.S. with smaller locations — some about a quarter the size of a typical 40,000-square-foot unit — designed for New York and other cities it abandoned over high rent. “When it comes to all those millennials who want to live in those urban centers, we’re nowhere,” Brandon says. So far, the chain’s suppliers are on board, says Isaac Larian, the CEO and founder of toymaker MGA Entertainment. Early on, Brandon made the rounds visiting manufacturers and impressed Larian with a willingness to hear the unvarnished truth about the retailer. “He’s not a B.S. type of guy,” said Larian, whose company is best known for its Bratz dolls. “He doesn’t have a big ego.” Toymakers, of course, have every reason to be rooting for him. The nightmare scenario is that if Toys R Us fails, MGA and larger competitors like Mattel and Hasbro would be left at the mercy of mass merchants like Wal-Mart and Amazon, which drive down prices. “The toy business needs to have an anchor in the mind of the consumer,” Larian said. “If no Toys R Us, no toy business.” Bloomberg reporter Jodi Xu Klein contributed to this report.

Investors are on a tightrope walk between risk and low returns Credit: Getty Images Laura Suter 24 September 2016 • 7:02am Investors are now paying to hold a third of the debt issued by developed market governments, and yet yields continue to fall – even where they are already negative. Bonds, for generations a staple holding in a mixed portfolio, in many cases now guarantee owners a modest loss. They also pose the risk of a potentially large capital loss, leading to some of the biggest fans of these assets warning savers to sell up and switch into cash. Negative yields on bonds (see boxout) arise because low interest rates have forced investors to chase yield, driving up the prices of income-generating assets and in turn crushing their yields.    The extremity of the markets – the decision in America to hold interest rates depressed yields further on Thursday – has led to some of Britain’s biggest bond owners turning sour on the sector. Why bond yields can turn negative Richard Woolnough, who runs the £15.5bn M&G Optimal Income fund, told investors that falling bond yields meant fixed-income assets had lost their advantage over cash (his comments are below).  Mr Woolnough said that until recently bonds held their edge over cash because the income on offer compensated investors for the potential capital losses. However, with bonds now offering minimal or no income, that risk of capital loss has become too great.  It’s not the first time a feted bond fund manager has warned on market conditions. Three years ago bond fund manager Chris Bowie, who then ran money for fund group Ignis and is now at TwentyFour Asset Management, warned investors to sell. At the time, his warning was based on bonds’ failure to yield more than inflation. Today, although inflation has fallen, the situation is worse – with many of the same bonds yielding nothing or less than nothing. Professional investors have increased their cash levels as the risks of bonds are not paying off Cash is the answer for many professional portfolio managers, with cash positions reaching levels unseen since the period after Lehman crash in 2008, according to the latest of regular surveys by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. When quizzed on why cash levels were high, fund managers said they had a bearish view on markets and prefer cash over low-yielding equivalents.  What’s more, 82 per cent of the managers believe bonds issued by developed markets are too high. But the problem is spreading out into other assets, as investors crowd into high-quality stocks, US and European corporate bonds and emerging market bonds.  So what does this mean for individual investors? The yield squeeze and your portfolio  Mike Deverell, investment manager at Equilibrium Asset Management, said the current market means the traditional investment model of 60pc stocks and 40pc fixed income – quality bonds – is “dead”. He has reduced equity and fixed income exposure in his portfolios and built up cash.  Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity, the fund manager and broker, said that around $13 trillion of government bonds are now offering negative interest rates, a “pretty extraordinary state of affairs”. “It is fair to say government bonds at today’s prices are very unattractive,” he said. “Why would you lend money knowing you’re going to get a negative return? In large parts of the market you are getting close to zero or negative yields. For an everyday investor what is the point, particularly as they are going to pay a fee on top of that for a fund?” The only reason an investor would hold these bonds is if they believe in the “greater fool theory”, said Mr Stevenson: “Buying bonds at these prices only makes sense if someone else will pay an even higher price than you, and that doesn’t seem like a very prudent basis for an investment.”  But with Bank Rate at 0.25pc and possibly set to fall further, and savings accounts offering next to nothing, cash is not appealing.  “I think as a short-term solution it makes sense but as long-term move cash absolutely doesn’t make sense,” said Stevenson.  Follow us for more investing ideas: @TelegraphInvest  Put an investing question to our experts: moneyexpert@telegraph.co.uk  Instead, investors have two options: accept lower returns or move up the risk spectrum.  Lee Robertson, chief executive of wealth manager Investment Quorum, said investors have to “reset” their expectations of the kind of investment world we are living in.  Corporate bonds, although riskier than those issued by governments, can offer better returns, but only in pockets of the market. The hunger for yield has now filtered through into the corporate bond market, too, and some corporate bonds from blue-chip companies are trading at negative yields – just like the government debt of developed economies. This has been made worse in Europe by the European Central Bank’s programme of buying corporate bonds as part of its “quantitative easing” programme, a move the Bank of England is now following.  “Negative rates have stretched out into corporate bonds, and some of the stronger companies are issuing debt close to 0pc, but those aren’t widespread and corporate bonds still look attractive generally,” said Adrian Lowcock of Architas. Unilever, the company behind household brands such as Persil, Walls and Hellmans, has issued a bond paying no income; while bonds from companies such as healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson and industrial company General Electric already have negative yields.  One way to navigate this is to use strategic bond funds, where managers have the resources and time to adequately research the parts of the market that are paying a decent income, advisers say. “We like strategic bond funds,” said Mr Deverell, “which target higher yield corporate bonds and are safer. You can get 4pc to 5pc distribution, which is a lot better than you get from government bonds.”  Strategic bond fund managers Jenna Barnard and John Pattullo, from investment house Henderson, say returns are certainly harder to find However, Jenna Barnard and John Pattullo, managers of the £1.7bn Henderson Strategic Bond fund, have warned investors to expect lower yields across the market.  Mr Pattullo warned investors will continue to get income from bonds, but that ”capital gains from here is getting a lot more challenging”.  Opportunities for income – where they remain Away from bond market, investors who are willing to take on more risk can still find returns. “Bond proxy” companies, the likes of Unilever and Proctor & Gamble, “still offer a higher and sustainable dividend income,” said Mr Stevenson.  “Equity income remains pretty attractive. In many cases you have got blue chip companies offering higher income on their equity than the bonds they issue, so equities are a better hunting ground for income than bonds,” he said.  Unilever, for example, currently yielding 2.7pc, has increased its quarterly payouts this year so far. These companies are protected against any potential downturns, as they have solid repeat business, said Mr Lowcock. “But if the economy grows more aggressively than it has been doing, then ‘bond proxies’ don’t tend to do so well.”  I am kissing every frog that is coming through the doorMike Pinggera, Sanlam FOUR Equity income funds are one way for investors to access a range of these companies in one place. Mr Robertson said the Newton Global Higher Income fund and investment trusts, such as City of London, were currently offering good yields.  Despite recent scares over property funds, which saw a number of “open-ended” commercial property funds preventing withdrawals amid panic after the Brexit vote, opportunities remain in the property sector for decent yield.  Mr Deverell has made a “small allocation” to the Kames Property Income fund, which is currently yielding 5.75pc and is 9pc cheaper than before the referendum. The fund also has no allocation to London property – an area Mr Deverell thinks is more prone to devaluation.  “Don’t discount property,” said Mr Robertson, who is invested in the F&C Commercial Property trust. “It has had a bit of a rocky time but it seems to be coming back.”  Other areas where Mike Pinggera, manager of the Sanlam FOUR multi-asset fund, is unearthing income, include infrastructure, renewable energy and student accommodation. In the infrastructure space he has moved into the HICL Infrastructure trust and 3i Infrastructure, which are yielding 4.5pc and 3.8pc respectively. “Real assets produce an income immediately but with long-term linkage to inflation,” he said.  “I think it is a challenge for everybody, there is no doubt about it. Generating returns will remain a task,” Mr Pinggera said.  “I do think that it is right to expand investment horizons. You can make incremental increases to the yield of the overall investment portfolio by taking small positions in different things and collectively push up income,” he said.  However, Pinggera, who said he is “kissing every frog that is coming through the door” in a bid to find yield, says he is not yet moving into newer areas, such as peer-to-peer lending.

We want to see more of the world, together, while we can still explore on foot. My dear mother is very elderly and bedridden. She needs more company to brighten her remaining days,” shared Moutrie. “Of course, it’s hard to part. My clients, co-workers and this wonderfully engaged community will always have a special place in my heart.” Moutrie was appointed to her position in December of 1993.  Under the City Charter, she is responsible for advising the Council and other City officers and representing the City and its employees in all civil matters. She attends meetings of the City Council and local bodies, approving the form of contracts, drafting ordinances and resolutions, prosecuting misdemeanors and otherwise enforcing local laws. She also appoints the deputy attorneys and support staff needed to fulfill these responsibilities. This large body of work is handled by the office’s 42 members, comprised of 24 full-time attorneys and 18 support staffers.  Each year, their work includes thousands of criminal cases and hundreds of complaints from consumers, tenants and code enforcement personnel.  They defend the City and its workers in an average of about 200 civil matters in the state and federal trial and appellate courts.  The cases range in complexity from straight forward trip and fall claims to civil rights and employment claims to complex constitutional challenges to City laws and policies.  They also prepare or review thousands of contracts, leases and licenses, draft dozens of ordinances, provide advice at countless public and staff meetings, provide training to various groups and constantly monitor public process and transparency issues and conflict issues. “For over two decades, our City has been extremely fortunate to have Marsha leading our legal work. The combination of her deep knowledge of the law, commitment to our complex community and her savvy leadership, has helped shape the vibrant, innovative and diverse city we have today,” said Mayor Tony Vazquez. “We have all benefitted from her absolute dedication to the public process. She will be missed.” As with other areas of the City’s work, the City’s legal work often includes unique issues and challenges.  “I am proud of the work the office has done over the years to promote community welfare by effectuating Council’s laws and policies, including those relating to housing, tenants’ rights, homelessness, consumer protection, and land use, among others,” said Moutrie.  “Like the City as a whole, the office takes on big   million from the major oil companies and other polluters. We did the legal work to defeat a state take back of about $200 million in redevelopment funds, preserving it for meeting local needs. We drafted and defended laws that promote affordable housing and ensure shared use of our treasured public space, and those laws were adopted as models by other cities. These are just a few examples of how this team has earned its state- wide reputation of outstanding legal work.” Some of the most notable accomplishments of the City Attorney’s Office since 1994 include: Litigated against major oil companies who polluted City wells with MTBE; advanced legislation that caused statewide, and later national, phase out of MTBE; recovered $275 million from all major oil companies; later recovered and additional $108 million for PCP/TCE contamination of groundwater by Boeing and Gillette/Proctor and Gamble. The City Attorney’s Office received the ABA State and Local Government Achievement Award, recognizing best public law office in the country for this work. (City of Santa Monica v. Shell)  Only city attorney’s office in the country to challenge deceptive practices in the bullion/gold sales industry; recovered $10 million for victims.  Drafted and successfully defended a law regulating events in public spaces for the purpose of ensuring reasonable, shared use; it was challenged on First Amendment grounds, upheld in federal court and became a model for other cities. (Santa Monica Food Not Bombs v. City of Santa Monica)  Drafted and defended the Affordable Housing Production Program law. That law became a model for other cities. Performed transactional work necessary to produce over 1900 affordable units.  Recovered a total of $2.5 million for consumers in four recent cases challenging unfair billing and other unfair practices of businesses selling goods and services within the City. Litigated through the California Supreme Court Harris v. City of Santa Monica, which changed California reemployment discrimination law.  Lawyers representing both sides were jointly given California Lawyer of the Year Award. Protected Tenants rights by drafting, defending and enforcing local laws, e.g., laws prohibiting harassment and requiring relocation payments. (Action Apartment v. City of Santa Monica)  Protected the beach/ocean, public health and the environment by drafting and publicizing laws against smoking and use of reusable plastic bags.  Protected low wage immigrant workers against wage violations by car washes; recovered $656,000 in back wages.  Preserved public property for public benefit through resolution of long-standing beach encroachment disputes with private owners through negotiation and litigation.  (City of Santa Monica v. Ornstein)  Protected local quality of life in residential neighborhoods by prosecuting clubs that fail to observe noise limitations and other local regulations.  Drafted, successfully defended and enforced laws that address impacts of homelessness (Doucette v. City of Santa Monica).  Helped establish and operate Homeless Court as a diversion program to help persons long homeless in the community to get off the streets; program has permanently housed 70 persons. Worked to break the cycle of violence by prioritizing prosecution of domestic violence cases, prosecuting them vertically, and working closely with local serve providers to aid victims. Provided all legal work necessary to support City’s various public works and public programs, e.g., Main Library, Pico Branch Library, Virginia Avenue Park, Annenberg Beach House, Tongva Park, Expo Light Rail,  Esplanade, California Incline,  programs for seniors and youth, after-school programs, senior programs, arts programs, after-school programs, and human services grants. Drafted and successfully defended against constitutional challenge laws that regulate street performance and street vending in order to respect individual rights while protecting shared enjoyment and aesthetics of public space. (Lamle v. City of Santa Monica)  Successfully resolved difficult and lengthy dispute involving religious displays in a public park through ordinance drafting and litigation. (Santa Monica Nativity Scenes Committee v. City of Santa Monica) “Losing Marsha Moutrie, even into her well-earned retirement, which we knew was inevitable, is a challenging transition for our City,” said Councilmember Kevin McKeown. “I’m grateful we enjoyed her excellent leadership for so many years, and grateful she leaves us such a highly skilled and motivated staff of attorneys to continue handling our legal workload while we seek a replacement. We will find a new City Attorney, but never another Marsha Moutrie.” The Council is expected to begin its search for a new City Attorney next week.   Post a comment Name E-Mail City Comments Comments Comments Advertise With Us For the best in Santa Monica advertising opportunities, click here!

Sergey Furtaev i LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Many middle-market business owners struggle to determine whether to continue pouring significant time, money and other resources into non-core business divisions or subsidiaries — that is, those that are not vital, essential or are no longer necessary to a company. For many, finding the right answer is a difficult task that often gets deprioritized while they focus almost exclusively on the immediate needs and daily operations of their businesses. Unfortunately, neglecting to address these questions often ends up hurting their businesses and diminishing their success. How should you approach a division that is troubled, not growing, no longer fitting your core business or strategic plan, and/or consuming a disproportionate amount of time and capital? Following is some practical guidance based on my experience helping middle-market business owners evaluate the alternatives and navigate these complex issues. First, an easy answer could be: If the non-core division is losing money and/or dragging down the rest of your business, you might shut it down. However, this quick fix is not always the best course of action. Another party might find value in the division and give you additional capital that you can redeploy for growth. Keep in mind that what is not good for you might be ideal for someone else. If the line of business has this type of potential, you might try to find a buyer capable of maximizing it. So, how should you begin your analysis? ▪ Start by closely evaluating the financials for the business unit you might be looking to sell or shut down. You should also examine on a pro forma basis the financial situation of the remaining business as a standalone unit, thereby enabling you to examine the financial implications of the potential divestiture and make sure it will not hurt your business financially or otherwise. For example, the division might actually be contributing to help cover a part of your overhead. In this case, a divestiture could have more serious financial implications on your overall bottom line than you had imagined. ▪ Evaluate your company’s current management and employee headcount. If you divest the division, do you need to reduce management, as well as your company’s overall headcount? How would this impact your company? Would losing these employees hurt other areas of your business? ▪ Evaluate your real-estate facilities and determine what you should do with any physical space that will be vacated after the divestiture. Let’s say the division you are looking to sell occupies 30 percent of your warehouse. Would you be better off subleasing that space, moving other core business operations into that space, or leaving it open to accommodate future expansion? ▪ You must also evaluate the potential impact of the sale on your clients or customers. Do they currently choose to do business with you because of your ability to serve as their one-stop shop and offer those products or services, even if those products or services are non-core business areas that are unprofitable or loss leaders? Could the sale potentially cause you to lose customers or diminish their satisfaction? Also, what about your competitors — do they currently provide any of those sought-after products or services? If you were to eliminate that part of your business, would you be in effect giving your competitors a greater advantage by positioning them to serve your customers and steal your market share? Big companies continuously evaluate the return on equity, performance and viability of their non-core business divisions or subsidiaries. This helps them to ensure that these lines of business are not hurting their growth rates, overall profitability and success by forcing them to devote disproportionate amounts of time and energy to these areas. Many large companies like GE and P&G continuously evaluate their varied lines of business and remain ready to sell any non-core assets. This best practice helps make them stronger and better focused on growth and acceptable levels of profitability. Some companies may have the in-house expertise to handle these evaluations independently, but others may need assistance from outside consultants. Whatever the case, it is important for middle-market business owners to work with qualified professionals with proven expertise helping companies similar to theirs navigate these issues. While this may require some investment in terms of time, money and other resources, it will pay off in the long run by helping ensure your business is well positioned for continued success.

NEW YORK: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Thursday sought preferential trade access to the US market to boost bilateral trade between Pakistan and the United States. "We seek preferential trade access to the US market so that Pakistan and US businesses get a fair chance of doing business with each other. Such an arrangement is necessary to boost bilateral trade," the prime minister said while speaking at a luncheon co-hosted by the US-Pakistan Business Council (USPBC) and the US Chamber of Commerce. He expressed hope that the US Chamber of Commerce and the USPBC would play their role in bringing the two countries closer on this and in convincing the US administration and Congress for its need. "This will go a long way in strengthening the relationship between the two countries, their people and businesses," he added. The prime minister said he firmly believed that a strong trade and economic relationship was an essential pre-requisite for a stable, long-term people to people relations. The United States has remained an important economic and trading partner of Pakistan, he said, adding, this partnership has been beneficial for private businesses of both countries and instrumental in fostering growth in Pakistan. "However, the level of trade and investment between the two countries has not kept pace with global trends," he said and mentioned that recognising this, both President Obama and he agreed in their meeting in October 2013 to jointly work on developing a Joint Action Plan to expand bilateral trade and investment flows over the next five years. "I see tremendous potential to deepen trade, economic and investment cooperation between our two countries. Your role as business leaders, investors and entrepreneurs is critical in enabling our two governments to fully harness the potential," he added. He said turning around the economy, overcoming the energy crisis, combating extremism and terrorism and investing in education have been the key priorities of his government ever since assuming office in June 2013. "I am, therefore, particularly pleased to share with you the details of the progress achieved by Pakistan," he added. The prime minister said as a result of bold economic reforms, his government had achieved significant improvement in all major economic indicators. Pakistan's growth has increased and the budget deficit has been reduced, he added. He said with a young and vibrant population of 200 million, growing consumer demand, as well as a stable economy and improved security, Pakistan offered enormous opportunities for profitable investment and trade. Giving an overview of some of the key economic indicators in Pakistan, the prime minister said inflation is now well below 3% - the lowest in 47 years. The State Bank of Pakistan in its Monetary Policy Decision announced in May 2016 decreased the discount rate to 5.75% - again lowest in last 4 decades, he said, adding that upgradation of the Karachi Stock Exchange to Emerging Market Index by Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) was an important development. The Boeing International Operations and Policy director expressed his desire that Boeing wanted to partner with PIA and was ready to offer 777 and 787 planes for PIA Premier Service through transparent and competitive process. The Proctor and Gamble Selling and Marketing Operations president said that the company has already achieved 20 percent increase in its growth in Pakistan. "We are ready to further invest $100 million in Pakistan."
