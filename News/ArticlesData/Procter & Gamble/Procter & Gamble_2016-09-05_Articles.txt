Speaking at a recent conference, Pritchard discussed how the firm had examined its own "hall of shame" as part of an effort to escape the "content crap-trap" – a problem which has emerged as brands roll out increasing amounts of material. "What we found," he said, "was that in our quest to do dynamic, real-time marketing in the digital age, we were producing thousands of new ads a year, with thousands of different agencies, and millions of media plan changes." (For more, including further tips for marketers, read Warc's report: How Procter & Gamble escaped the content "crap trap".) Pritchard highlighted creative for Oral-B featuring what appeared to be a "devil baby", as well as a video for Pepto-Bismol entitled, "The Boy Raised by Goats", as examples of where P&G's work had fallen short. "We at P&G: we're all guilty as charged," he confessed. "We're all trying, we're all experimenting, and that's fine – that's good. And we all do this." Drilling down into this subject, he suggested that the understandable impulse across the ad industry to reach consumers on an ongoing basis via multiple channels risked undermining their efforts, rather than building engagement. "I guess that we thought that the best way to cut through the clutter in the digital age was to create more ads and change them exponentially. Or, alternatively, maybe we just thought consumers love our ads; they can't get enough of them," said Pritchard. "We eventually concluded that, as the world was getting louder and more complex, we were simply just adding to the noise." By establishing a clear sense of purpose, focusing on the true "craft" of advertising and embracing creativity, marketers can deliver powerful messaging and start tackling issues like ad blocking, P&G's brand chief argued. "The people we serve are voting with their fingertips; they are saying that too much of our advertising is unwanted, uninteresting, uninspiring, and, therefore, ineffective," Pritchard said. "Never accept mediocrity. Don't ever be seduced into the crap trap of just 'getting something out there'. On every part of the canvas, craft matters."

The reason: Facebook's promise of "targeted marketing" simply doesn't deliver the goods. P&G have got better results – particularly for its air freshener, Febreze, by going back to old-fashioned mass marketing. I could say I told you so, but many of the digital clevers out there – and brand managers desperate to appear technologically hip – won’t listen. The reality is that the old “dinosaurs” like TV and print still work. One of the reasons newspapers are still a highly effective advertising channel is that readers do pay attention to the ads. In some cases, readers remember the ads before they remember the deathless prose of yours truly. This is especially true where the ad has a price or a number in it: print can be very effective as a call-to-action and retail medium. If a price is truly appealing, and the surroundings appealing, then a print ad is powerful. The Trafalgar ad Another one caught my eye this week in The Star, for Trafalgar, the well-known tour and travel company. The main image in the ad showed a couple, against the backdrop of what could be an old European castle or city wall, about to tuck into some delicious ice creams. The headline said, simply: “Taste your way around Europe”. Below that was a real call-to-action line: “+Save 10%”. There followed details of some of the company’s European itineraries, which all feature food in some way. Along with these were the all-important numbers, price and savings. I bet many people lingered over it and did their sums. It’s effective advertising and it works because it’s in print. And good value, too... So the first Orchid this week goes to Trafalgar. Advertisement And to show how effective TV can be, especially when the ad is well shot and directed, I was mesmerised by a Checkers commercial for its top quality pork offerings. It featured a number of top South African chefs and pork dishes they prepared. To say it was mouth-watering doesn’t come close. Both my wife and I noticed it. It positioned pork as something to salivate over and it positioned Checkers as the place to get the best. Checkers has done this before and got Orchids from me, most notably for its food. So, here’s another sizzling, tasty one for you, Checkers. Well done. One of the grammatical, and common sense, rules that people often get wrong is the use of “ever”, or “all time”. Both those phrases mean exactly what they say. So if you boast that your product is the “best ever”, you are saying, somewhat stupidly, that it will never be bettered. Never say never. Overuse use of ever is never going to make it correct, just as feet are different from metres. And difference does make a difference: I would hope the pilot flying the plane I am in would know the difference between feet and metres. So, I was irritated this past weekend when Caltex kicked off its latest national promotion by saying it was offering the “best prizes ever”. Even if they had used correct grammar – “best prizes to date” – they would have fallen a long way short. Please people, a number of vouchers for a road trip of R15,000 each (including fuel) are hardly the best in history up to now. They are not that great by today’s standards. The chances of them being the “best ever” are, therefore, nil.

Just What Is the 'Agency of the Future' and Has Omnicom Built It? Dedicated McDonald's Shop Takes Leap Toward New Model, But It's One of Many Approaches By Jack Neff. Published on September 06, 2016. Reprints Reprints Explosion Credit: iStock Marc Pritchard might have said it best: "Frankly, your complexity should not be our problem, so we want you to make that complexity invisible." Addressing agencies at Ad Age's Digital Conference in April, the Procter & Gamble Global Brand Officer added that "our expectation is that over time, our agency partners, whoever we choose, are going to be able to integrate [all of the workload], so you can get the production out, the distribution out as well as the creative out." It's not just P&G. Amid a movement toward transparency, marketers broadly are demanding that agencies simplify processes while still delivering a complex array of marketing services specific to their needs. They want to cull agency lineups, using fewer agencies or at least a single agency or other party to lead the multidisciplinary throng. Making that happen gets even tougher as media continues to fragment, increasing marketer demand for advertising and other content to feed a growing array of channels, and for a wider variety of providers from outside the tradititonal agency world to fill the void. This "agency of the future" is what Omnicom Group says it will bring to McDonald's, following its win last week of a closely watched review it won out over Publicis Groupe. This unnamed multidisciplinary shop will have 200 staffers and will partner on site with employees from Google, Facebook, the New York Times content studio in addition to people from other Omnicom agencies, including digital shop Critical Mass, Omnicom Media Group, multicultural shop Alma, and boutique agency Sparks & Honey. Pushing for years It's the latest iteration of an agency-of-the-future idea some big marketers and agency holding companies have been pushing for years. WPP, which bowed out of the McDonald's contest over reported concerns about cost pressures, has been perhaps the biggest proponent to date, deploying such hybrid custom agencies from Ford (Global Team Blue) to Colgate-Palmolive Co. (Red Fuse). Michael Fanuele Credit: General Mills Similarly, General Mills is seeking for its U.S. grocery business "one core agency to handle the bulk [of the work] but to supplement with other partners, which might be technology platforms or media partners," said Chief Creative Officer Michael Fanuele, or "an anchor agency supplemented with a roster of interesting partners." One of the participants in the General Mills pitch is Publicis Groupe, which is proposing a holding-company solution, yet there are others in the hunt not pitching in that manner, including McCann, Deutsch, Mother and 72andSunny. "This an exercise in finding the right partners, not the right model," said Mr. Fanuele. David Beals, CEO of consulting firm JLB and Partners, said he sees few clients clamoring for a custom holding-company solution taken by Omnicom for McDonald's. "It gets reported when it happens, because it's big news," Mr. Beals said. "But there are down sides to the model that in reality prevents it from becoming more pervasive." The talent issue Chief among those, he said, "Is how do you attract top creative talent if you're an agency that's just in service to one client?" Even if the custom agencies after a year or two open up to outside clients -- as is the plan with Omnicom's McDonald's shop or WPP's Global Team Blue -- he said, "in the meantime you're asking people to work for a year or two with only one client only." The alternate approach of periodically pulling people in from other agencies creates additional logistical issues, which include holding-company turf wars and avoiding the conflict issues that maintaining separate agency brands within holding companies is designed to circumvent.

Increasingly, for example, P&G brands don't have both a general creative and digital agency, and while statistics aren't broadly available, Mr. Beals believes a single agency covering both is becoming the norm. Unilever, in the midst of simplifying its own marketing ranks in its latest reorganization, is looking to simplify agency lineups too, according to people familiar with the matter. Unilever's zero-based budgeting exercise -- similar to what dozens of other big marketers have undertaken in recent years -- essentially makes the question of whether the company needs as many agencies as it has now part of the process. But ultimately, it also comes down to longing for the days when a brand had basically one agency and a fear that specialization breeds distraction and waste. "One of the things that concerns me most is the potential fragmentation of our brands," said Unilever Chief Marketing and Communications Officer Keith Weed in an interview at Cannes in June. "You have lots of agencies telling you this is what you have to do to be fluent on mobile, on social, on search. And if you're not careful, the brands get pulled in different ways." Gerry Preece, a P&G marketing procurement alum and now senior consultant with External View Consulting Group, said the quest for simplification and finding a new, more functional agency model is the top business generator for his firm at this point. Gerry Preece Credit: Gerry Preece "It's driven by a fundamental dissatisfaction with the way things are going," he said. "Agency structures are still too siloed, and integration is too hard to do." Marathon training It's also clear that simplification is no sprint, more like a marathon on a twisting road. Take P&G, which nearly a decade ago began an effort to simplify its far-flung marketing-services system at a time when the company had an estimated 2,500 agencies and roughly $1 billion in agency and production spending. It implemented a Brand Agency Leader system that designated a point agency to work with all the rest. By 2014, though, P&G was working with 6,000 marketing-services agencies and spending around $2 billion annually. Thanks to a new round of consolidation and simplicity efforts, the company has reduced those numbers to around 3,600 agencies and $1.4 billion. But simplification remains far from simple. Despite Mr. Pritchard's call for simplification, the urge to try new agencies and models is hard to resist. Amid its broad agency culling, P&G's SK-II brand went outside its main agency Leo Burnett to tap hot Swedish independent shop Forsman & Bodenfors for an SK-II project in China that focused on single women over 25 cruelly referred to as "leftover women," which won a Glass Lion at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. For another recent project, P&G's Olay tapped a team of five video bloggers represented by Gen.video to come to its Cincinnati headquarters, talk with researchers and create videos for a new line of eye creams that was used on the brand website, adapted by the bloggers for their site and used as advertising on e-commerce sites. It's a different approach really dictated by how media is changing, Mr. Pritchard said in an interview: "The paid and earned advertising world are blending together as never before," he said. "This is a different approach for a new ecosystem." It's also one more sign that work that once done by ad agencies can now come from many places, including media companies or video bloggers building their own miniature media empires on the backs of other media companies. Frenemies Nowhere was that more obvious than at the Cannes International Festival of Creativity, where frenemies lurked everywhere as everyone to some extent was looking to get into someone else's business. Facebook and Google were there, looking in part to expand their direct relationships with marketers, which include developing creative and media planning in some cases, albeit also heavily focused on working with agencies. IBM was there to tout not just data and analytics, but also its agency services. And WPP's J. Walter Thompson won Creative Data and Cyber Grand Prix awards for a project seemingly worthy of IBM's Watson -- "The Next Rembrandt," which used facial recognition, predictive data modeling and ED imaging to create what it projected Rembrandt's final painting would have looked like had he lived a bit longer. Beyond the question of what is JWT doing in the predictive analytics business is the question of why is IBM in the agency business? It's taken a bigger plunge of late, acquiring independent digital shop Resource Ammirati and adding former Unilever VP-global media innovation Babs Rangaiah to lead its Global Marketing Solutions Effort earlier this year. Babs Rangaiah Credit: Rohanna Mertens A big part of what IBM looks to do is actually to help manage, not add to, the complexity, Mr. Rangaiah said, for example by helping companies do some of the work he was doing at Unilever in navigating a particularly complex chunk of the marketing universe – the ever denser thicket of ad-tech providers. "In the past the advertising agency was the right hand of the CMO," he said. "In the past three to five years, with the increased importance of technology and data, that just hasn't been the relationship, and the CMO or anyone working on a brand can't just count on the ad agency to lead that." Beyond offering some agency services, Mr. Rangaiah believes the IBM iX unit he works for can work as the integrator of the marketing effort. "I don't think it's so much of a turf war as an urgent struggle to get marketing right," Mr. Preece said of the increasingly crowded field of agency types, and he believes the core problem is that the industry has yet to identify exactly who should integrate all their efforts. In many cases, marketers themselves are comfortable handling the job of parceling out work among various agencies, said Mr. Beals. But Mr. Preece believes the marketers "are in an even weaker position than 10 years ago to do this, because marketing organizations have been stripped down." Mr. Preece said he led the group at P&G that once helped do this, but said, "It's a very labor-intensive thing, and for a typical marketer it's tough to do. Most agencies aren't structured to do it either." The nitty gritty of the integration work requires skills such as optimization of work processes and attention to detail more akin to cost accounting or logistics management, he said, "which is the kind of work most agencies eschew. It's not who they want to be. But it's becoming more and more critical to marketing. And somebody's going to have to build it, or marketing is just going to be inefficient." Handing the job off to a consultant or other third party just adds another layer of cost and complexity, he said. And he believes agency holding companies are in the best position to actually do the job, given that they own many or most of the pieces needed and merger-and-acquisition executives who have a purview of the external market. But he doesn't believe holding companies have generally developed people designed to put all the pieces together for marketers. "Integration is something that as an industry we are not well structured to handle," he said. "And the need there has exploded because the complexity has exploded."

Here’s how some top marketers approach it now Sep 6, 2016 Amy Laski   YouTube star Troye Sivan meeting fans at Fan Fest 2015. Brand marketers are still figuring out how best to manage relationships with influencers like Sivan. (Don Arnold/Getty) If only we still watched daytime soap operas. I can’t say I’ve ever felt compelled to watch them myself—but as a business owner and marketer in today’s highly fragmented media landscape, I must admit that simpler times—when the original “sponsored content” could reach millions every day—have a certain appeal. It was 1933, after all, when Procter & Gamble began producing sensationalized radio dramas as a way to deliver its advertising to homemakers, and it later made the leap to television (the company went on to produce blockbuster soap operas like Another World, As The World Turns, and Guiding Light). This innovation helped P&G captivate a vast audience of housewives each afternoon and attain market leadership against key competitor Lever Brothers. If you were a marketer in the mid-20th century, you could devote most of your budget to one source that was clearly and explicitly advertising, then call it a day. For decades, the dominant model of marketing has been brands “talking to” consumers, as they did in the golden age of soap operas. Brands would transmit a message, without any sort of expectation by consumers of conversation or reciprocity. Being “engaged” with a brand meant buying it, and little else. Now, consumers expect a brand to “talk with” them, to engage them beyond the functional benefits of a product and into the transcendental benefits of being associated with that brand. Like it or not, two-way, consultative conversations are considered table stakes today. Brands that don’t open themselves up to these conversations risk appearing dated and impervious. As a result, the old “outreach” model is dead. It has to evolve into an “inreach” approach, whereby the former recipients of marketing communications are “insourced,” or embedded within a brand’s core processes, from planning through execution. Optimism is the heart of great marketing Yet, our mission as marketers remains the same. Canadian Business marketing columnist Bruce Philp said it best: “We still show up for work in the morning to make something people want, present it to those people and sell it to them at a price that leaves everybody satisfied. The tools for doing it have evolved continuously for a century, but the essence of marketing is the same as it ever was.” Putting this into play, however, can pose a major challenge for business leaders today. Successful brands need to engage their audiences and stakeholders in two-way conversations. But according to the fifth McKinsey & Company Global Survey on external affairs,”[engaging external stakeholders] ranks as a top or top three priority for more than half of CEOs…yet only 17 percent say their companies are very effective at tailoring their narratives.” While social media makes it easier to reach target audiences, it’s getting more challenging to engage and influence them. So what are some of the new rules of engagement? And what tools and solutions are proving effective, particularly when it comes to working with bloggers, influencers, content creators, and media? As our thoughts turn to nailing down plans for the year ahead, it’s a good time to start thinking about these new rules of engagement. I checked in with some of our client partners and respected brand leaders for their take on today’s marketing landscape, and what we can all be doing to best navigate it. Made to measure…but what? At General Mills, Associate Marketing Manager Nicole Korb says several of the company’s brands work directly with influencers and bloggers, a trend that is, without question, continuing to gain momentum. “As marketers, we’re obsessed with measurement. We want to see how any given ‘lever’ we’ve pulled can impact sales. Ideally, we’d want to see how sales have increased based on our work with influencers. I haven’t seen that so far, but we respect the work of influencers more and more, because we see the impact [on engagement metrics] when an influencer shares our content.” For example, General Mills works with Bewitchin’ Kitchen and Dinner with Julie for its “Life Made Delicious” social platform. These bloggers concoct new recipes each month using a variety of the company’s products, then blog about them. Looking at numbers alone when evaluating an influencer partnership may not actually be that effective, given followers can be “bought.” The focus should be in quality vs. quantity: fit with your brand, engagement levels and the composition of the influencer’s viewership or readership. And like any prospective investment, brands should still begin with their bottom line business goals and then use those to orient communications goals and strategies. These may be measurable in dollars and percentage points, or improved brand perception and purchase intent over time. From transaction to trust While even a few years ago it would have been deemed unethical to “buy” media coverage (unless of course it was clearly labeled “advertorial”), today, there are entire companies dedicated to enabling brand leaders to buy coverage from so-called social influencers. These influencers have earned loyal followings based on their unique points-of-view and the compelling ways in which they express them. But, while they may have “earned” the right to be paid for the content they create, is the resulting content deemed credible by consumers? That remains uncertain. How new rules could change Canada’s social media marketing landscape Pay-to-play transactional content may have a place in an integrated communications plan, but should not be the only pillar. Furthermore, both sides of the proverbial coin benefit from a policy of full disclosure when payment has been exchanged for content. While this has been mandated in the United States, here in Canada consumers will still have to sift through it all for themselves and make their own decisions about what can be trusted and what cannot, at least until early 2017 when Advertising Standards Canada plans to introduce disclosure rules here. Even when these are in place, it is questionable whether sponsored content will be discernible, particularly since the non-compliance process and consequences are as murky as disclosure is for many influencers. In our team’s work with creators (bloggers, YouTubers, Instagrammers and the like) we have heard, time and again, that they’re eager to establish longer-term relationships with brands, rather than “pay to play” transactional ones. This desire is echoed on the brand side as well. According to Holly deGraaf, Interim General Manager and Director, Retail Operations and Public Relations at Ten Thousand Villages Canada, “The highest [impact is made] when what [bloggers] share and write doesn’t look like— [or better yet, isn’t]—a paid endorsement. The beauty of many bloggers is that their followers feel like they are connecting with a friend. To sully that by having too much of a paid content feel could be detrimental.” The penultimate goal is to strike the right balance to produce paid or company-generated content as good as high-quality editorial, such that it will be embraced by consumers. Many brands either err too much on the “advertorial” side, where consumers tune out veritable propaganda, or the content is too soft and fails to set up the story to sell-in the product. An example of a brand that’s getting it right is Ontario’s liquor distributor, the LCBO, with its glossy magazine Food & Drink. Graham Robertson is the former VP Marketing with Johnson & Johnson Canada and is now President and CMO at Beloved Brands. He says, he “doesn’t know why anyone would want to follow a media outlet that just pumps out sponsored content all the time. If only one out of every 10 messages is authentic, they will be losing followers.” Nicole Korb from General Mills weighs in: “Right now, we treat PR [and influencer/blogger relations] as a media buy, as a channel. There are increasingly opportunities to collaborate and co-create with influencers, and brands need to do more of that.” Crossing the line There’s no question that we’re in the age of information overload.  Robertson says, “There’s just too much out there. People are no longer seeking out news and knowledge, they are filtering through it. ” He looks forward to its evolution—a “settling down”—to a more credible, focused and consolidated, media environment. The five skills marketers of the future will need As communicators, marketers, media, stakeholders and influencers all navigate this new ecosystem, one thing is certain: collaboration is a necessity for doing business today and going forward. We need to shift our approach from the old-school “outreach” model to an “in-reach” model, which actively cultivates and incorporates the thoughts of influencers and stakeholders in every facet of business, from product development to content co-creation to crisis communications. Mattel did this last year in their quest to evolve Barbie into a more true-to-life body type: They brought together a group of carefully selected female leaders, including Canadian icon Erica Ehm. In a series of meetings at Mattel headquarters with top decision-makers, these women not only helped shepherd major changes for the Barbie brand in a way that would resonate with parents and their kids, but also fostered fandom amongst the female leaders who took part. As Ehm said, “I’m so proud to have played a tiny part in re-imagining Barbie to become a doll that girls can see themselves in, no matter their size, shape or colour.” This inreach model—or as our team is calling it, our “content collective approach”—is mutually beneficial. So when you’re sitting down at the table to plan for 2017 and beyond, you’ll want to have the right people who influence your target’s opinions—and your bottom line—at the table, engaged in the right way. No soap opera dramatics necessary. Amy Laski is founder and president of Felicity [Inspiring Communications], a communications and content agency based in Toronto.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    A divided House of Representatives is keeping several crucial pieces of key legislation for the nation's veterans from advancing, Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald said Tuesday, while addressing the massive transformation the nation's primary veterans agency has been undergoing in the past two years since he was brought on board. "We have put forward 100 different pieces of legislation that we need to continue this transformation," McDonald told MSNBC's "Morning Joe" program. "Some of them are absolutely critical to veterans getting [assistance]." The most important legislation would cover extensions and providers agreements, said McDonald, noting that the Senate has been working together and has passed the Veterans First Act out of committee unanimously. That legislation, if passed, will serve to improve the accountability of employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs and to improve healthcare and benefits for veterans while amending Title 38, the U.S. code governing veterans' benefits.  However, the House's divisiveness is "not allowing these things to get through committee and to the floor," said McDonald, insisting the lag is not because of a funding issue. "I think there's a tremendous unanimity what needs to be done, but it's just the matter of having political will to get it done," he told the program. McDonald was brought in from the private sector after being with Procter & Gamble for 30 years, including running the company, with President Barack Obama tasking him with making it the VA run like a successful healthcare business. "We have hired more doctors, put in more space, more nurses, expanded hours," said McDonald. "We've driven down disability claim backlog by 90 percent, from its peak of 600,000 and we've cut veteran homelessness in about half since 2010. We are making progress but we've got more to do." McDonald took over a VA that was plagued with scandal following revelations that wait lists had been falsified to conceal chronically long wait times for care. The VA is in the midst of implementing a new scheduling system, to replace one dating back to 1995, said McDonald, and has hired a former Johnson & Johnson IT director to work on the VA's issues. "Fourteen of 17 of my top managers are new," said McDonald. "We're in the midst of a transformation." GOP nominee Donald Trump has spoken of privatizing some of the VA's functions, but McDonald thinks that is a bad idea. "When I came in, before my Senate confirmation, some senators asked me to look at that," said McDonald. "I'm a business guy and I look at those kinds of things. What I discovered was not only do veterans need the VA and want the VA, but also American public and American medicine needs the VA." Many key advances have come from the VA, including the nation's first implantable pacemaker, the first liver transplant, the first kidney transplant, and the shingles vaccine, noted the secretary. "The VA trained 70 percent of doctors in this country," said McDonald. "Without the VA, who would train those doctors? Then clinical care. Over 80 percent of veterans say they prefer getting their care at the VA, and they recommend it to a friend." September is National Suicide Prevention Month, and McDonald said the VA is making a special effort toward preventing suicide among veterans, after a report this summer revealed an estimated 20 vets commit suicide every day. "There's no question that any suicide of any veteran is a terrible thing," said McDonald. "The biggest challenge is how we get people connected. We have a new hashtag that we are doing on Twitter. "We really need the help of the American public. When you notice the signs, get them connected. Call our crisis line. Let's get them connected so we can treat them."

(espensorvik/Flickr/Creative Commons) Join us on our podcast each weekday for an interesting story, well told, from Charisma News. Listen at charismapodcastnetwork.com. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday banned some over-the-counter antibacterial hand and body wash products, saying they are no more effective than soap and water and could cause long-term harm. The move affects 2,100 products, or roughly 40 percent of the over-the-counter antibacterialsoap market, Dr. Theresa Michele, director of the FDA's division of nonprescription drug products, told reporters on a conference call. The ruling does not affect alcohol-based hand sanitizers or antibacterial products used in hospitals and clinics. The agency said it is banning products that contain any one of 19 ingredients that have not been proven safe. Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble Co and Colgate-Palmolive Co have said they have either reformulated or are reformulating their products to delete the most common of the 19 ingredients, including triclosan and triclocarban. FDA spokeswoman Andrea Fischer and Brian Sansoni, of the American Cleaning Institute, which represents multiple cleaning products companies, were unable to identify the products most affected by Friday's ruling. The FDA had proposed banning the ingredients in 2013 unless companies could prove they were safe and effective, but was unsatisfied with the data. The ACI, whose members include Dial Corp., a unit of Germany's Henkel, insists the products are effective. <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=408064169" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=408064169" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement "Clearly this is an industry that needed a good, swift kick in the triclosan. It took far too long," said Ken Cook, the president of the Environmental Working Group, a non-profit environmental research organization. Thomas DiPiazza, a spokesman for Colgate-Palmolive, said none of the company's products in the continental United States are affected, although a "small quantity of our bar soap in Puerto Rico, where FDA rules also apply, is being reformulated." Procter & Gamble spokeswoman Tressi Rose said it will replace "a few" products well in advance of the FDA's deadline for removing or reformulating the products a year from now. The regulator also deferred by a year a ruling on three additional ingredients used in consumer wash products – benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride and chloroxylenol (PCMX) – to allow for the submission of new safety and effectiveness data for those ingredients. Consumer antibacterial washes containing those specific ingredients may be sold during this time, the FDA said. Manufacturers are conducting research to fill data gaps identified by the FDA, Sansoni said. © 2016 Thomson Reuters.

Grab these big-upside opportunities before they vanish. Thinkstock By Brian Nichols September 8, 2016 The stock markets may be near all-time highs, but there are countless high-quality large-cap stocks to buy that keep getting pushed lower, simply haven’t risen with the rest of their peers or remain grossly underpriced despite recent gains. It is absolutely inexcusable that some of these stocks keep flying under the radar as screaming buys. Much of Wall Street hasn’t noticed, but the value and upside are too apparent for anyone just willing to look. See Also from Kiplinger: 3 Battered Stocks to Buy While They Are Down This fact almost guarantees that two years from now, each of these noted securities will have outperformed the market. Advertisement With that said, I have seven stocks to buy that are beaten-down, disrespected and poised to beat the market in the years to come. You’ve heard of every one of these names, but you might not be familiar with the great value case at play right now. Gilead Sciences The fact that Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) stock trades at $78 per share and less than 7 times earnings is insulting to the intelligence of investors. No, Gilead’s blockbuster HCV franchise is no longer responsible for billions of dollars in new revenue each year. And no, Gilead has not completed its next game-changing acquisition. However, despite Harvoni’s rapid sales decline, its drugs Sovaldi, Truvada, and Viread are still performing well enough to keep Gilead’s total losses at a minimum. Analysts expect sales to decline 6% this year and 3% next year. That’s not too bad for a company with $30 billion in annual revenue. Advertisement Furthermore, Gilead may go through several years of mid-single-digit revenue losses, but with operating margins over 60%, it will still generate lots of cash and create shareholder value. Personally, I think GILD is the most attractive acquisition target in all of healthcare. But even if Gilead isn’t acquired, it can create long-term value from buybacks, future dividends and, of course, acquisitions of its own. AT&T AT&T Inc. (T) isn’t exactly beaten-up. In fact, it’s only 6% off its high and has soared at a whopping 19% this year alone. And it’s still a value! AT&T trades at just 15 times free cash flow with a nearly 5% dividend yield. You don’t find many opportunities like that in a market like this. Advertisement Dividend stocks in just about every other industry are overvalued. Consider that Procter & Gamble Co (PG), which yields just 3%, is trading at 21 times free cash flow. Further, many of the stocks that Wall Street considers top dividend plays continue to trade at multiyear highs — and many of those, like Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM), have real macro risks. See Also from InvestorPlace: 7 Dividend Stocks That Owe You More Money AT&T is a company with strong future earnings potential because of Mexico, Latin America, 5G and the Internet of Things. Its free cash flow is only going to grow larger. With its dividend costing less than $12 billion annually to maintain, that growth in free cash flow will continue to create long-term shareholder value. Apple It’s likely that no stock is more disrespected than Apple Inc. (AAPL). And it’s possible that no stock offers more short-term upside. Advertisement Apple currently is off 20% from its all-time high. That loss is largely tied to its expected 8% decline in overall revenue this year. At less than 12 times free cash flow, AAPL is poised to surge as the next generation of iPhones spark top-line growth over the next year. So while Apple’s 8% loss in 2016 has not been pleasant, it gives the company some favorable comps for 2017. Given that iPhone “s” units are always in less demand than next-generation iPhones, investors can assume that 2017 will showcase considerable year-over-year growth — likely far better than the 4% growth that analysts expect. That means a lot of potential rocket fuel for Apple shares. Kroger Grocery retail is a segment of the economy that performs well regardless of the market. Within that segment, Kroger Co. (KR) has been the leader. Kroger has grown identical supermarket sales for 50 consecutive quarters, and has stolen market share from the likes of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) while pushing smaller players like Whole Foods Market, Inc. (WFM) aside. Despite its very impressive past growth, Kroger is on pace for 5% growth in each of the next two years as it enters new businesses like specialty pharma and online/mobile grocery. If there is one company that should not be questioned, it is Kroger. Therefore, it is a bit odd that analysts see deflation and pricing pressure as a big risk for the grocery retailer. Yes, it is a concern, but if any company can weather the storm, it is Kroger. See Also from InvestorPlace: The 10 Best ETFs on the Planet There is simply no reason for KR to be trading 24% off its 52-week high. This is long-term value just waiting to be snapped up. Walgreens Boots Alliance Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA) is another stock with recent losses — it’s down 16% from its 52-week high — that I can’t explain. While some of the pressure is likely political, investors must realize that no matter what happens with the Affordable Care Act, no politician is going to rip healthcare away from the millions who are now insured thanks to Obamacare. Any change will be for future enrollees. With that said, WBA is the king of retail pharmacy here in the U.S., but it is quickly building end-to-end solutions for the entire pharmaceutical space. When it successfully acquired Boots, it gained pharmaceutical wholesale and with a 23.9% stake in AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC), it has distribution and sourcing incentives. After it absorbs Rite Aid Corporation (RAD), Walgreens will grow its retail presence, but the bigger catch may be the gain of EnvisionRX through RAD, a pharmacy benefit manager, to compete with CVS. In other words, Walgreens is a complete play on healthcare, and at 16 times free cash flow, WBA trades well below fair value. Bank of America Bank of America Corp. (BAC) has had a great month after rallying 11%. However, it still is down 10% from its 52-week high, and it still presents a good buying opportunity. Investors have been skeptical of big banks since the housing crisis, but now there are countless reasons to own BofA in particular. Not only has the company’s earnings been solid, but it recently passed its stress test. This gave BAC approval for a far more significant dividend and share repurchase plan. These developments are why BAC stock has recently surged higher, and will continue to do so. See Also from InvestorPlace: 7 Healthcare Dividend Stocks for Quality and Security While it is hard to predict the Fed’s action with interest rates, we all know the Fed wants to raise interest rates. No industry benefits more than banking, and no stock is better positioned or cheaper to gain from interest rate hikes than BofA. Collectively, it is a great time to own BAC. Dollar Tree Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR) has fallen 13% over the last month. The losses are in response to earnings that did not meet high expectations. Investors must realize that DLTR is not a quarter-to-quarter kind of business, but operates year-to-year with little regard for Wall Street and a long-term vision. What it accomplished with Dollar Tree retail stores before Family Dollar is simply incredible — to achieve a higher margin than any of its competitors with a $1 cap. I doubt any other retailer could be profitable with Dollar Tree’s business model. That’s why DLTR might ultimately be the best performing stock on this list 10 years from now as margins, revenue, and its stock multiple rises over time. Further, if Dollar Tree can earn the highest margins of its competitors with a $1 cap, including Walmart, then just think of what it can do without that cap in an equally large Family Dollar! It will take some time, and some growing pains, but history proves that DLTR will make all current investors who hold look like geniuses 10 years from now. This article is by Brian Nichols. As of this writing, he was long AAPL, BAC, DLTR, GILD and T.

Photo: Ramesh Pathania/Mint As chief executive officer of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Sue Desmond-Hellmann leads the Foundation’s efforts to promote equity for all people around the world. This is her third visit to India and she is excited to meet with the India country office, which is led by Nachiket Mor. In an interview, she talks about the challenges in India, the partnership between the Indian government and the Foundation, how exciting it is to work with the Gates’s and her experience as a director on the board of directors at Facebook Inc., and Procter & Gamble. Edited excerpts: As head of the Gates Foundation what do you see as some of the biggest challenges in India? In India, our work started with HIV aids and that was tremendously positive. The other positive experience that the Foundation has had with collaboration is for polio that led to its eradication so the infectious diseases that are issues for people, especially poor people. HIV Aids is still a global issue but less so in India. The eradication of polio led to bigger aspirations but clearly our focus in India is on maternal neonatal and child health, nutrition, expansion into areas of agriculture, financial services for the poor, water sanitation and hygiene but our work is also focused on the two states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (UP) in particular, because 300 million people are there. So if we are focused on equity and making the biggest impact with our partners, Bihar and UP are the obvious places for us to go. What has been the Indian government’s stance towards the Gates Foundation? One of the reasons we are extremely committed to India are the two states of UP and Bihar, but the other reason we have been in India and continue to be in India is the very positive interaction with government. What we do as a Foundation is that we never pick sides, we are not political because government’s change. We are careful about following the law, we are apolitical. But its also practical for us because we know there are transitions to government so we push ourselves to always be prepared to be the people who bring the data, who care about equity, health problems and that has served us well. Our goal is that whoever is in government and is in the job, thinks of the Gates Foundation as experts who give inputs and wisdom that can help with the problems and that is a positive thing for us. We value our independence and stay above the fray of the government or politics not only in India but also in America where we are in the middle of elections. Staying above that is very important. You also talk a lot of precision medicine. How can this be used to solve health problems in India? I’ve challenged myself and my colleagues that if we are thinking about things like HIV Aids or Tuberculosis (TB) we need to know precisely where in India TB is the biggest problem. Let’s be more precise and more effective in making a diagnosis for TB, so we have been working, including with private providers, to make sure that they can recognize TB where it is and the most precise thing is to know where is the most resistant TB, the most serious, scary kind. The degree to which India will benefit with more precise effective diagnosis and therapy for TB outstrips what we could accomplish with the cancer story in the US. So the more precise we are with who is affected with the disease and how we can most effectively treat them minimizing side effects and minimizing costs, as an ambition is profoundly more positive especially in low resource areas. This precision is just a fancy way of saying let’s get smart because when resources are low, you have to make the best, most precise use of it. How is it like working with co-chairs Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett who is a trustee of the Foundation? It’s been great. They are all so different. The thing I love about working with Bill is that he is like a walking encyclopedia you can ask him anything and he’s thought about it read about it and remembered everything so one of the things I enjoy working with him is if I’m struggling with something, or I’m thinking about a problem, it’s really fun to think through with him because he has data, facts and history. What I love about Melinda is that she brings her passion about women and girls so directly to our work. I am a scientist so I ask about the statistics and the DNA but Melinda when she is thinking about the problems we are trying to solve will say what did that mom think, what did that mean to her, how will that affect her family, so she brings this incredible empathy and she’s also a mom so thinks in ways that are so empathetic to the human beings involved in the problems we are trying to solve that I am so inspired by what drives her passion which is that women and children have a better life in the future. And Warren is one of the funniest people I’ve worked with. Here is this hard hitting, tough Berkshire Hathaway businessman—but every time I am around him, I can’t stop smiling because he’s so funny. When we had our first annual employee meeting—he announced that he had made up a song just for me and he gets on the stage and sings for me. And I thought who in the world is so important and so special and does that, well Warren does. People use this funny word called ‘folksy’ I don’t know if you use that word in India. It’s kind of down to earth, humble and never forgetting your roots—Warren epitomizes that. He is just very folksy and funny. You are also on the board of Facebook and P&G, so how is that experience? I joined the board of Facebook more than three years ago and before I joined the board, I met Mark several times. At that time I was chancellor at the University of California, San Francisco, and I was fascinated about Facebook for medial reasons. I wanted to learn more about Facebook because I had learnt how important a social network is in behaviour change, and as an American physician I was really struggling with diseases like diabetes and obesity. I wanted to talk to Mark about this and how he thought about social network and behaviour change. We really enjoyed meeting each other and after a while I joined the board. And I’m delighted with the experience. Mark is a great leader, it’s extraordinary at such a young age how seriously he takes being a CEO and a leader, and I also enjoy being with Sheryl Sandberg who is such a great female leader. And it is such a big contrast to working as a director at Procter & Gamble that is 175 years old and all about consumer products. I wanted to learn at P&G about branding and marketing, something I don’t know much about, but I also learnt about integrity and company values, so both boards in their own ways have taught me a lot about management, leadership, about growth of a company, and cultures and I use those learnings everyday at the B&M Gates Foundation. What do you think have been some of the tangible achievements of the Gates Foundation in India? Making increments in maternal and infant health and survival has been extremely important, polio eradication in collaboration with others is another big, achievement and the third I’d mention is enormous progress in financial services for the poor what we call mobile money. There has been great progress, more to come but there is a lot of potential for people to get access to funds now.

Lee Jeans Introduces the Lee Woman and the Lee Man Denim Brand Returns to Can-Do Roots With GSD&M Campaign By Adrianne Pasquarelli. Published on September 06, 2016. Lee Jeans today debuts a brand refresh, complete with TV spots, a new website and a digital push as a way to reengage customers who may have been drifting away. The heroes of the new "Move Your Lee" ad platform are the Lee Man and the Lee Woman, who each appear in his and her own 30-second TV spot. The Lee Woman is "lean, mean and covered in jean," as she works as a physician, rides a motorcycle and takes care of her kids and husband. Similarly, the Lee Man likes to crash through boardroom walls and crushes having fun as he wears his "freedom pants." "We created this purpose, this life in motion," said Kim Yates, who joined the VF Corp.-owned brand as VP of marketing from Procter & Gamble last year. "There's this playfulness, an unpretentious nature of who we are that's always been there in the humorous way we approach the consumer and we wanted to bring that back." She noted that Lee's innovative fit, which includes stretch and cooling, wicking and warming properties in its jeans, allows its wearers to embrace a more active lifestyle. Interestingly, this "can-do" life was initially introduced by Lee's founder, Henry David Lee, who created the brand 127 years ago. "From an innovation standpoint, we're still in sync with our founder, but from a communication standpoint, we weren't," said Ms. Yates, who noted that most consumers only remember ads featuring the doll Buddy Lee, which first aired over 15 years ago. VF Corp. purchased Lee in 1969. The 30-second spots will also air in 15-second versions. A 45-second video will appear online that includes mini vignettes as well. Lee's new website debuted last week, and the brand is also rolling out new products for both men and women this fall. Omnicom's GSD&M handled creative duties, while Lee worked with Starcom on media and Hill & Knowlton Strategies on PR. Ms. Yates declined to say how much the Merriam, Kansas-based brand is spending on the effort. Last year, VF Corp. dedicated $19.8 million, or 19% of its total spending on measured media in the U.S., to Lee, according to Kantar Media. Though VF Corp. does not break down sales by label, its jeanswear division, which includes Lee, Wrangler and 7 For All Mankind, represents $3 billion of the conglomerate's $12.4 billion sales. Last week, Lee's sibling brand Wrangler unveiled its own new marketing campaign, which similarly highlights the adventure and boldness of wearing good denim.

She is a Pahara Aspen Fellow and a Ms. Foundation Public Voices Fellow through The OpEd Project. Don’t forget them this Labor Day—or ever Labor Day is not only a day off work for many Americans to acknowledge the contributions of millions of workers; it is also a day off from childcare for millions of American children and the educators who work to care for them. Although the earliest years are the time of greatest brain development, we have structured childcare as the responsibility—and burden—of individual families. Unlike our system of K-12 education, we don’t include early childhood education as part of our public investment framework. That neglect is in spite of the acknowledgment from many arenas of the importance of early childhood education. Police chiefs across the country have called for investment in early childhood education as a way to reduce crime, citing research demonstrating that children who have high-quality early learning experiences are five times less likely to engage in criminal behavior as adults. Mission Readiness, a consortium of retired military leaders, purports that early childhood education is essential to our national defense, by helping to a create a pool of better-prepared and qualified military recruits. Business leaders such as John Pepper, the former CEO of Proctor & Gamble, and Ben Bernanke, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, have identified early childhood education as critical to developing the workforce of tomorrow. Yet despite the importance of their work, early childhood educators work long hours for low pay. The median income for childcare workers is just $20,320, less than hairdressers or janitors. Half of the nation’s early childhood educators live in poverty, scraping by with the help of federal benefits such as food stamps and Medicaid. African-American early childhood educators earn 84 cents for every dollar earned by their peers. To complicate matters, we call them “babysitters,” not educators. We ignore the training, care and attention that they bring to their work with children. As a result, the choice to engage in this profession can seem ill-advised. Because most early childhood educators are poorly paid, we tend to assume that their work lacks value. Because we assume that their work lacks value, we feel justified in paying them poorly. In the absence of a universal childcare system, this cycle is created by our assumption that childcare is a private good, and that families should shoulder the burden of care without public support. Yes, early childhood education is expensive; center-based childcare for an infant or toddler is more expensive than college tuition in most states. We have a model for investing in early childhood education as a public good: the United States Military. Our nation’s defenders have created a system for investing in childcare that is affordable, high-quality and accessible for military families. They provide quality training and oversight for childcare programs serving military families, subsidize up to 50% of the cost of care, and ensure adequate wages—$15 an hour, on average—for childcare workers. Major Latosha Floyd writes: ““The U.S. military has come to realize that providing reliable, high-quality child care for service members’ children is a key component of combat readiness.” It’s time to create a system of national investment comparable to what the military has. By Labor Day 2017, we can hope to have a plan in place for an early childhood education system that isn’t built on the backs of its workers. And one that does not forfeit the future for the children they teach. Tap to read full story TIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary on events in news, society, and culture.

The UK throws away around 3bn disposable nappies a year, while in the US it’s approximately 20bn. Each can take hundreds of years to degrade. But now companies are developing new ways of reusing dirty nappies. Waste2Aromatics, a Dutch-led project from tech company Biorizon, is working with a consortium of companies to convert the virgin wood fibre from recycled nappies, supplied by UK nappy recycler Knowaste, and other absorbent hygiene products (AHPs) into bio-aromatics – raw materials for the chemical industry. “These products can be used in coatings, lubricants and performance plastics,” says Biorizon project manager Murk van Rooijen. “We hope to produce small amounts of these products in the next 18 months.” Plans are underway to commercialise the technology, starting with a pilot plant likely to be built in the Netherlands, which could be operational by 2019 Bio-aromatics could potentially replace traditional aromatics made from fossil fuels, if production can be scaled up. “We haven’t calculated the CO2 emission savings in detail yet, but expect to have these results in six months,” says van Rooijen. Knowaste’s UK managing director Paul Richardson says projects like Waste2Aromatics may represent the future of nappy recycling. Knowaste aims to recover around 18% of the UK’s AHP waste, including disposable nappies, by building five to seven specialist recycling facilities over the next five years. It’s ambitious, given that nappy recycling is still nascent in the UK. Currently Knowaste uses mostly commercial sources to collect AHP products, such as hospitals, nursing homes. The company is aiming to tap into the harder to access domestic stream, which Richardson estimates produces more than three times the amount of waste. While there are councils with dedicated nappy recycling schemes, these are few and far between. Knowaste was refused planning permission in July for a £15m nappy recycling plant in west London over potential odour problems. In 2013, Scottish nappy recycling trials involving Knowaste’s now-closed West Bromwich plant were deemed a success, but they have since ground to a halt with no plans to reinstate them. Despite this, Richardson remains optimistic. He says his company has developed products such as pet litter, waste containers and insulation material from the recovered fibre and plastic fractions of AHP waste. “The cat litter market for the UK and Europe is around 500,000 tonnes a year, and we would produce about 10,000 tonnes from one facility,” he says, adding that Knowaste has secured a wholesale deal for the cat litter, that would cover the output from two plants. Global nappy brands Pampers and Huggies are keen to be associated with similar end-of-life solutions. In Italy, Pampers manufacturer P&G has established Fater, a joint venture with AHP producer Angelini, to build a pilot plant capable of recycling 8,000 tonnes of disposable nappies each year, which are likely to come from kerbside collection schemes. Pampers’ spokesman Ioannis Hatzopoulos says the technology is still in pilot stage but the plastics generated by the facility could be turned into street benches, school desks and bottle tops. Two of P&G’s US manufacturing sites are converting pre-consumer nappy and baby wipe scrap into upholstery filling. Hatzopoulos says the plan is to roll this out across other sites. “We use nappy scrap to produce baby wipe containers in a closed-loop recycling programme. Last year, we also started using nappy scrap to generate fuel cubes used in cement plants locally for heating.” In New Zealand, Kimberly-Clark’s Huggies partnership with Envirocomp has composted over 19m nappies since 2008 to make soil for landscaping. Customers register with Envirocomp, pre-purchase compostable nappy bags and are then able to deposit used nappies at drop off points. More than NZ$850,000 (£467,000) has been invested in the initiative. “We’re working to create a more circular business model that allows us to recapture materials for reuse,” says Kimberly-Clark’s sustainability adviser, Ryan Kane. Kimberly-Clark is also repurposing leftover nappy scrap – its Huggies nappy mill in Sydney, Australia, is fitted with a specialist reclaim unit. Kane says any material that can’t be reused is sold on to local producers for horticultural and consumer goods, or processed into fuel pellets for cement factories. Startups like DYCLE and gDiapers are addressing nappy waste. DYCLE’s social enterprise model turns compostable nappy inserts into black soil – a fertile, synthetic soil – to grow fruit and nut trees. A pilot project ran in Berlin last year, involving a week’s supply of nappies from 20 babies. “One tree could produce 50kg of fruit every year,” says DYCLE founder, Ayumi Matsuzaka. “We want to keep the harvested fruit in the local communities. We could turn it into baby food, juice, jams and more.” Another way of dealing with the waste stream is to focus on nappy design. GDiapers, featuring an outer reusable pant with flushable or compostable inserts, says its nappies are growing in popularity – despite commanding a 10-15% premium over traditional disposables. “We see cost reductions possible in the near future,” says Jason Graham-Nye, co-founder of the Australian-based company. Due to “challenges with older plumbing”, Graham-Nye says gDiapers aren’t guaranteed to be flushable outside of Australia and North America. That said, Europe now accounts for nearly one-third of global sales of gDiapers, 50% of which are in the UK.

Clinton says she won't go to Mexico before Election Day World by The Associated Press Posted Sep 5, 2016 8:36 pm MST Last Updated Sep 5, 2016 at 9:40 pm MST WASHINGTON – The Latest on campaign 2016 (all times Eastern): 10 p.m. Hillary Clinton says she won’t be going to Mexico before Election Day. ABC News’ David Muir asked Clinton Monday if she would accept Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto’s invitation to visit, as Republican rival Donald Trump did last week. Clinton responded, “No.” The Democrat says she’s “going to continue to focus on what we’re doing to create jobs here at home.” At a rally earlier Monday in Cleveland, Clinton called Trump’s meeting with Pena Nieto “an embarrassing international incident.” ___ 8:30 p.m. Donald Trump is praising Phyllis Schlafly, the conservative activist who died Monday at 92, as “a patriot, a champion for women and a symbol of strength.” Trump says Schlafly was “a conservative icon who led millions to action, reshaped the conservative movement and fearlessly battled globalism and the ‘kingmakers’ on behalf of America’s workers and families.” Schlafly helped defeat the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s and founded the right-wing Eagle Forum. Trump says in a statement released Monday night, “She fought every day right to the end for America First.” Schlafly endorsed Trump at a rally in St. Louis in March, and she co-authored a book called “The Conservative Case for Trump” that is being released Tuesday. Trump says he was “honoured to spend time with her.” ___ 5:50 p.m. Hillary Clinton says the U.S. has shown “great restraint” to a series of cyberattacks by state and non-state actors. But Clinton told reporters travelling with her on her new campaign plane that “we are going to have to take those threats and attacks seriously.” The Democratic nominee said that a Russian attack on the U.S. election system is “almost unthinkable.” She said that Russian President Vladimir Putin appears “quite satisfied with himself” and the U.S. needs to “make clear that we’re not going to let anyone interfere with the decisions of the American people.” Clinton’s comments follow reports that the Russian government may have been involved in the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails just days before the party’s national convention. The emails, later revealed by WikiLeaks, showed that DNC officials had their finger on the scale favouring Clinton over her opponent Bernie Sanders. ___ 5:43 p.m. Hillary Clinton says she is concerned about “credible reports about Russian government interference in our elections.” “We are facing a very serious concern,” Clinton told reporters travelling with her to Illinois Monday, adding that the U.S. has never had a foreign power get involved in electoral system like the recent hacking of Democratic National Committee emails. She added that there has also never been a candidate who urges a country to hack more, alluding to comments made by her opponent Donald Trump who said in a July news conference: “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.” He later said he was being sarcastic. The Democratic nominee told reporters Monday that recent accusations that Russia is behind the DNC’s hacked emails “raises some grave questions about potential Russian interference with our electoral process.” ___ 4:35 p.m. Sen. Bernie Sanders is urging voters to remember that this election has never been about the people running for office, but about the voters. Campaigning on behalf of his former rival, Hillary Clinton, on Labor Day, Sanders told a crowd of supporters that the election is “about you and your needs and the needs of the American people.” For that reason, he said, Clinton is the best choice. Despite a handful of protesters with the die hard “Bernie or Bust” movement and supporters of Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Sanders’ speech largely stuck to the major points of intersection between himself and the Democratic nominee. He pointed how that both he and Clinton will fight for increased funding for sustainable and renewable energy, a higher minimum wage, a Supreme Court nominee who supports overturning Citizen’s United, and increased infrastructure spending in order to create more jobs. ___ 4:00 p.m. Hillary Clinton is calling Donald Trump’s trip to Mexico last week an “embarrassing international incident.” She said on Monday that Trump’s immigration speech in Arizona last week was one of his most “hate-filled, hard-line speech yet.” She suggested that he’s already set his position in stone when it comes to deporting everyone living in the country illegally, even as he continues to shift his language. Clinton said Trump would “double down” on his “absurd plan” to use a deportation force to round up people living here illegally. Trump told reporters Monday that immigrants living here illegally may not need to return to their countries of origin to obtain legal status. His position on what to do with people living in the United States illegally continues to be unclear. ___ 3:30 p.m. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are letting Ohio voters know they’re important while campaigning in Cleveland on Labor Day. Kaine, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, asked at crowd at a Labor Day festival Monday if they felt “battle-tested and ready for the home stretch.” Labor Day typically marks the final and most intense period of presidential campaigning. Ohio is a critical swing state. No Republican has won the White House without capturing the state in modern campaigns. He says Ohio voters know how to work the grassroots to win on Election Day. Clinton, meanwhile, said Ohioans know firsthand the importance of selecting a president, noting President Barack Obama’s bailout of the auto industry that saved jobs in the state. “I’m not taking anything for granted, that’s why we’re here today.” ___ 3:20 p.m. Hillary Clinton is having a rough start to her Labor Day rally, battling a stubborn cough. The Democratic nominee took the stage in Cleveland coughing uncontrollably, before turning it into a joke about her opponent, Donald Trump: “Every time I think about Trump I get allergic.” Several people in the crowd began shouting “get her some water.” She battled through the cough and delivered her speech with some difficulty. Both Clinton and Trump are in Ohio courting voters in this critical swing state. ___ 3:00 p.m. Former President Bill Clinton says the Clinton Foundation is doing good work around the world and says his wife’s political opponents are trying to distract voters from the issues by raising questions about the organization. Clinton spoke Monday to the annual AFL-CIO Labor Day picnic at the Coney Island amusement park near Cincinnati. Based on the records released so far, the AP found that more than half the people outside the government who met or spoke by telephone with Hillary Clinton during her tenure as a Cabinet secretary had given money — either personally or through companies or groups — to the Clinton Foundation. The AP’s analysis focused on people with private interests and excluded her meetings or calls with U.S. federal employees or foreign government representatives. Bill Clinton gave examples of Clinton Foundation partner projects, including with Cincinnati-based consumer products company Procter & Gamble Co. He says P&G’s clean water initiative has provided billions of water-purifying packets to help give safe drinking water in poor countries. He asked: “Is there something wrong with that?” ___ 1:25 p.m. Donald Trump’s immigration speech in Arizona last week may have gotten mixed reviews, but Trump says it was the “enthusiasm of the crowd” that inspired him. Speaking to reporters on his private plane in Ohio Monday, Trump said of his tough talk on immigration, “Some people loved it; A lot of people loved it.” The Republican nominee has come under heavy criticism for flip-flopping on the issue of immigration. Some Hispanic leaders who have been advising his campaign also said they feel betrayed after his long-awaited immigration speech that definitively ruled out a pathway to legal status for people living in the country illegally. Trump said Monday, “We had a very big crowd. It was unbelievably enthusiastic.” The speech was delivered on the heels of his visit to Mexico, where he held a joint press conference with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. The two said they discussed a number of issues on that visit, but not Trump’s controversial proposal to have Mexico pay for a border wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. ___ 1:20 p.m. Donald Trump says he plans to take part in all three presidential debates against rival Hillary Clinton. The Republican nominee was rumoured to be considering skipping at least one of the debates. But he told journalists aboard his private plan in Ohio on Monday that only something along the lines of a hurricane or natural disaster would keep him from participating. “I look forward to the debates,” Trump told reporters, saying he regards them as “an important element of what we’re doing.” As for preparation, Trump says he does not believe in doing mock debates, as is tradition for many candidates, saying, “I’ve seen people do so much prep work that when they get out there they can’t speak.” The first debate between the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees is scheduled to take place on Monday Sept. 26. ___ 1:20 p.m. Donald Trump has allowed a handful of journalists on his private airplane on the same day that his rival Hillary Clinton invited journalist to join her on her new campaign plane for the first time. Trump spoke with journalists Monday in Ohio before leaving his morning stop in Cleveland for Youngstown. The Cleveland Airport offered a glimpse of how critical the fight for Ohio has become in the lead-up to the general election, as airplanes for both party nominees and their running mates were parked on the tarmac Monday morning. Trump told reporters that he is open to inviting them on his plane more often. The billionaire businessman has repeatedly criticized Clinton for not holding a news conference since last year. ___ 1:00 p.m. Donald Trump’s campaign manager says there is a “very organized” effort underway to target Democrats in Ohio and beyond. Kellyanne Conway said Monday that “voters who traditionally have not voted Republican or haven’t even voted in a very long time seem to be coming out to support” Trump and his message. Trump was in Cleveland on Labor Day with Democratic Mayor Tom Coyne, of Brook Park, Ohio, who said he supported Trump in this spring’s Republican primary and would vote for him this fall. Conway said Coyne’s support for Trump is “just one example of what’s happening across this country.” ___ 12:25 p.m. Former President Bill Clinton is warning organized labour that Donald Trump’s economic policies would cause millions of Americans to lose their jobs. Clinton campaigned Monday for his wife, Hillary Clinton, at a United Auto Workers picnic in Detroit after walking in a Labor Day parade. He said that when the country last adopted Republican policies that cut taxes on the rich and raised the debt, “it didn’t work out too well for us.” Bill Clinton says his wife’s economic plan would create 10.5 million jobs while Trump’s would cut 3.5 million jobs. He is urging union members to support Hillary Clinton “because she has the best ideas.” He questions Trump’s leadership and says his visit last week to Mexico “damaged America in every serious country in the world.” He says Trump played nice only to return home “to dump on them” for his own political benefit. ___ 12:05 p.m. Donald Trump says he would have refused to meet with Chinese officials if they treated him like they treated President Barack Obama over the weekend. The Republican presidential highlighted the issue as he met with labour leaders Monday in suburban Cleveland. Trump noted that Obama couldn’t use his traditional staircase to exit Air Force One when he arrived in China over the weekend. The president used an alternative exit instead, something Trump described as “a metal staircase in the back of the plane.” Trump called it “a sign of such disrespect.” “If that were me,” Trump said, “I’d say, ‘You know what folks, I respect you a lot, let’s close the doors, let’s get out of here.'” Obama has downplayed the issue. ___ 11:55 a.m. Donald Trump says America’s manufacturing jobs are “going to hell.” The Republican presidential nominee blamed the Obama administration for allowing companies to move jobs to Mexico. He also lashed out at the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership as “a catastrophe.” The New York billionaire made the comments during a Monday round table discussion with labour leaders in suburban Cleveland. He’s spending Labor Day campaigning alongside running mate Mike Pence in battleground Ohio. The pair met with about a dozen current and retired union members, including teamsters, steelworkers, plumbers, police patrolmen and firefighters. Trump noted that he’s often best known for immigration, but he’s also focused on jobs and the economy. “We’re going to stop companies from leaving,” Trump vowed. He said it’s going to be “so easy.” ___ 9:55 a.m. Vice-President Joe Biden says there’s still work to be done to revive the American economy. Campaigning in Pittsburgh Monday alongside vice-presidential hopeful Tim Kaine, Biden told a crowd of union workers that the policies of President George W. Bush deeply hurt the economy and crippled job growth. He said the Obama administration “got the truck outta the ditch,” but that it’s still not going as fast as it could be. ___ 9:45 a.m. Vice-President Joe Biden is praising Tim Kaine, his possible successor, as a man who is highly qualified for the job and capable of handling any challenge that Hillary Clinton may throw his way. Biden joined Kaine in Pittsburgh for a Labor Day event Monday, where they addressed several hundred union workers. He said, “Hillary is really going to need him…because the plate is so full.” Biden said Kaine has more experience that any vice-presidential nominee in the past, something Democrats frequently say about Clinton in her quest for the presidency. He said he expects Clinton and Kaine to build a partnership similar to the one he’s built with President Barack Obama, if they are elected. Biden also described Kaine as a strong friend of organized labour, saying “no one has to tell Tim who built this country.” ___ 9:20 a.m. Tim Kaine is making Labor Day personal as he campaigns alongside Vice-President Joe Biden, the man he hopes to replace in the White House. Speaking to a crowd of several hundred in Pittsburgh Monday, Kaine shared the story of his father’s iron-welding business in Kansas City. He told supporters his father built a “partnership” with his employees, teaching Kaine and his brothers the value of shared prosperity. He said Democrats believe in management and unions working together, not against each other. Hillary Clinton’s father also ran a small business. Kaine said that as the children of business owners, both he and Clinton have a unique perspective toward the value of labour. He said, “We haven’t been sitting in an ivory tower.” Biden is also expected to speak at the Pittsburgh rally. ___ 8:00 a.m. Hillary Clinton is travelling aboard a new Boeing 737 campaign plane for the first time this Labor Day. Clinton was flying to events in Ohio and Illinois on Monday in a light blue-and-white campaign plane with her press corps. The plane has Clinton’s slogan “Stronger Together” on the side and her “H” logo on the tail. Clinton has travelled mostly by private jet during the campaign and has not held a formal news conference with journalists since December 2015 in Iowa. ___ 3:30 a.m. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are making competing Labor Day pitches in Ohio, setting the stage for a critical month in their testy presidential campaign. The Republican real estate mogul is joining running mate Mike Pence at a morning round-table discussion with union members in Cleveland. The Democratic nominee plans to arrive in the city for a Labor Day festival with union leaders and workers. Trump is also expected to campaign at a fair in Youngstown, Ohio, in a nod to the state’s role as a make-or-break proving ground for Republican presidential candidates. Labour Day has traditionally been the kickoff to the fall campaign. Both Clinton and Trump have been locked in an intense back-and-forth throughout the summer.

Trump and Hillary Clinton are making competing Labor Day pitches in Ohio, setting the stage for a critical month in their testy presidential campaign. (Ross D. Franklin, File/Associated Press) By Associated Press September 6 WASHINGTON — The Latest on campaign 2016 (all times Eastern): 10 p.m. Hillary Clinton says she won’t be going to Mexico before Election Day. ABC News’ David Muir asked Clinton Monday if she would accept Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto’s invitation to visit, as Republican rival Donald Trump did last week. Clinton responded, “No.” Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said Donald Trump "choked" during his Aug. 31 meeting with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, at a rally in Hampton, Ill. on Sept. 5. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) The Democrat says she’s “going to continue to focus on what we’re doing to create jobs here at home.” At a rally earlier Monday in Cleveland, Clinton called Trump’s meeting with Pena Nieto “an embarrassing international incident.” ___ 8:30 p.m. Donald Trump is praising Phyllis Schlafly, the conservative activist who died Monday at 92, as “a patriot, a champion for women and a symbol of strength.” Trump says Schlafly was “a conservative icon who led millions to action, reshaped the conservative movement and fearlessly battled globalism and the ‘kingmakers’ on behalf of America’s workers and families.” Schlafly helped defeat the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s and founded the right-wing Eagle Forum. Trump says in a statement released Monday night, “She fought every day right to the end for America First.” Schlafly endorsed Trump at a rally in St. Louis in March, and she co-authored a book called “The Conservative Case for Trump” that is being released Tuesday. Trump says he was “honored to spend time with her.” ___ 5:50 p.m. Hillary Clinton says the U.S. has shown “great restraint” to a series of cyberattacks by state and non-state actors. But Clinton told reporters traveling with her on her new campaign plane that “we are going to have to take those threats and attacks seriously.” The Democratic nominee said that a Russian attack on the U.S. election system is “almost unthinkable.” She said that Russian President Vladimir Putin appears “quite satisfied with himself” and the U.S. needs to “make clear that we’re not going to let anyone interfere with the decisions of the American people.” Clinton’s comments follow reports that the Russian government may have been involved in the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails just days before the party’s national convention. The emails, later revealed by WikiLeaks, showed that DNC officials had their finger on the scale favoring Clinton over her opponent Bernie Sanders. ___ 5:43 p.m. Hillary Clinton says she is concerned about “credible reports about Russian government interference in our elections.” “We are facing a very serious concern,” Clinton told reporters traveling with her to Illinois Monday, adding that the U.S. has never had a foreign power get involved in electoral system like the recent hacking of Democratic National Committee emails. She added that there has also never been a candidate who urges a country to hack more, alluding to comments made by her opponent Donald Trump who said in a July news conference: “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.” He later said he was being sarcastic. The Democratic nominee told reporters Monday that recent accusations that Russia is behind the DNC’s hacked emails “raises some grave questions about potential Russian interference with our electoral process.” ___ 4:35 p.m. Sen. Bernie Sanders is urging voters to remember that this election has never been about the people running for office, but about the voters. Campaigning on behalf of his former rival, Hillary Clinton, on Labor Day, Sanders told a crowd of supporters that the election is “about you and your needs and the needs of the American people.” For that reason, he said, Clinton is the best choice. Despite a handful of protesters with the die hard “Bernie or Bust” movement and supporters of Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Sanders’ speech largely stuck to the major points of intersection between himself and the Democratic nominee. He pointed how that both he and Clinton will fight for increased funding for sustainable and renewable energy, a higher minimum wage, a Supreme Court nominee who supports overturning Citizen’s United, and increased infrastructure spending in order to create more jobs. ___ 4:00 p.m. Hillary Clinton is calling Donald Trump’s trip to Mexico last week an “embarrassing international incident.” She said on Monday that Trump’s immigration speech in Arizona last week was one of his most “hate-filled, hard-line speech yet.” She suggested that he’s already set his position in stone when it comes to deporting everyone living in the country illegally, even as he continues to shift his language. Clinton said Trump would “double down” on his “absurd plan” to use a deportation force to round up people living here illegally. Trump told reporters Monday that immigrants living here illegally may not need to return to their countries of origin to obtain legal status. His position on what to do with people living in the United States illegally continues to be unclear. ___ 3:30 p.m. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are letting Ohio voters know they’re important while campaigning in Cleveland on Labor Day. Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, asked at crowd at a Labor Day festival Monday if they felt “battle-tested and ready for the home stretch.” Labor Day typically marks the final and most intense period of presidential campaigning. Ohio is a critical swing state. No Republican has won the White House without capturing the state in modern campaigns. He says Ohio voters know how to work the grassroots to win on Election Day. Clinton, meanwhile, said Ohioans know firsthand the importance of selecting a president, noting President Barack Obama’s bailout of the auto industry that saved jobs in the state. “I’m not taking anything for granted, that’s why we’re here today.” ___ 3:20 p.m. Hillary Clinton is having a rough start to her Labor Day rally, battling a stubborn cough. The Democratic nominee took the stage in Cleveland coughing uncontrollably, before turning it into a joke about her opponent, Donald Trump: “Every time I think about Trump I get allergic.” Several people in the crowd began shouting “get her some water.” She battled through the cough and delivered her speech with some difficulty. Both Clinton and Trump are in Ohio courting voters in this critical swing state. ___ 3:00 p.m. Former President Bill Clinton says the Clinton Foundation is doing good work around the world and says his wife’s political opponents are trying to distract voters from the issues by raising questions about the organization. Clinton spoke Monday to the annual AFL-CIO Labor Day picnic at the Coney Island amusement park near Cincinnati. Based on the records released so far, the AP found that more than half the people outside the government who met or spoke by telephone with Hillary Clinton during her tenure as a Cabinet secretary had given money — either personally or through companies or groups — to the Clinton Foundation. The AP’s analysis focused on people with private interests and excluded her meetings or calls with U.S. federal employees or foreign government representatives. Bill Clinton gave examples of Clinton Foundation partner projects, including with Cincinnati-based consumer products company Procter & Gamble Co. He says P&G’s clean water initiative has provided billions of water-purifying packets to help give safe drinking water in poor countries. He asked: “Is there something wrong with that?” ___ 1:25 p.m. Donald Trump’s immigration speech in Arizona last week may have gotten mixed reviews, but Trump says it was the “enthusiasm of the crowd” that inspired him. Speaking to reporters on his private plane in Ohio Monday, Trump said of his tough talk on immigration, “Some people loved it; A lot of people loved it.” The Republican nominee has come under heavy criticism for flip-flopping on the issue of immigration. Some Hispanic leaders who have been advising his campaign also said they feel betrayed after his long-awaited immigration speech that definitively ruled out a pathway to legal status for people living in the country illegally. Trump said Monday, “We had a very big crowd. It was unbelievably enthusiastic.” The speech was delivered on the heels of his visit to Mexico, where he held a joint press conference with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. The two said they discussed a number of issues on that visit, but not Trump’s controversial proposal to have Mexico pay for a border wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. ___ 1:20 p.m. Donald Trump says he plans to take part in all three presidential debates against rival Hillary Clinton. The Republican nominee was rumored to be considering skipping at least one of the debates. But he told journalists aboard his private plan in Ohio on Monday that only something along the lines of a hurricane or natural disaster would keep him from participating. “I look forward to the debates,” Trump told reporters, saying he regards them as “an important element of what we’re doing.” As for preparation, Trump says he does not believe in doing mock debates, as is tradition for many candidates, saying, “I’ve seen people do so much prep work that when they get out there they can’t speak.” The first debate between the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees is scheduled to take place on Monday Sept. 26. ___ 1:20 p.m. Donald Trump has allowed a handful of journalists on his private airplane on the same day that his rival Hillary Clinton invited journalist to join her on her new campaign plane for the first time. Trump spoke with journalists Monday in Ohio before leaving his morning stop in Cleveland for Youngstown.

Trump and Hillary Clinton are making competing Labor Day pitches in Ohio, setting the stage for a critical month in their testy presidential campaign. (Ross D. Franklin, File/Associated Press) By Associated Press September 5 WASHINGTON — The Latest on campaign 2016 (all times Eastern): 5:50 p.m. Hillary Clinton says the U.S. has shown “great restraint” to a series of cyberattacks by state and non-state actors. But Clinton told reporters traveling with her on her new campaign plane that “we are going to have to take those threats and attacks seriously.” The Democratic nominee said that a Russian attack on the U.S. election system is “almost unthinkable.” She said that Russian President Vladimir Putin appears “quite satisfied with himself” and the U.S. needs to “make clear that we’re not going to let anyone interfere with the decisions of the American people.” Clinton’s comments follow reports that the Russian government may have been involved in the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails just days before the party’s national convention. The emails, later revealed by WikiLeaks, showed that DNC officials had their finger on the scale favoring Clinton over her opponent Bernie Sanders. ___ 5:43 p.m. Hillary Clinton says she is concerned about “credible reports about Russian government interference in our elections.” “We are facing a very serious concern,” Clinton told reporters traveling with her to Illinois Monday, adding that the U.S. has never had a foreign power get involved in electoral system like the recent hacking of Democratic National Committee emails. She added that there has also never been a candidate who urges a country to hack more, alluding to comments made by her opponent Donald Trump who said in a July news conference: “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.” He later said he was being sarcastic. The Democratic nominee told reporters Monday that recent accusations that Russia is behind the DNC’s hacked emails “raises some grave questions about potential Russian interference with our electoral process.” ___ 4:35 p.m. Sen. Bernie Sanders is urging voters to remember that this election has never been about the people running for office, but about the voters. Campaigning on behalf of his former rival, Hillary Clinton, on Labor Day, Sanders told a crowd of supporters that the election is “about you and your needs and the needs of the American people.” For that reason, he said, Clinton is the best choice. Despite a handful of protesters with the die hard “Bernie or Bust” movement and supporters of Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Sanders’ speech largely stuck to the major points of intersection between himself and the Democratic nominee. He pointed how that both he and Clinton will fight for increased funding for sustainable and renewable energy, a higher minimum wage, a Supreme Court nominee who supports overturning Citizen’s United, and increased infrastructure spending in order to create more jobs. ___ 4:00 p.m. Hillary Clinton is calling Donald Trump’s trip to Mexico last week an “embarrassing international incident.” She said on Monday that Trump’s immigration speech in Arizona last week was one of his most “hate-filled, hard-line speech yet.” She suggested that he’s already set his position in stone when it comes to deporting everyone living in the country illegally, even as he continues to shift his language. Clinton said Trump would “double down” on his “absurd plan” to use a deportation force to round up people living here illegally. Trump told reporters Monday that immigrants living here illegally may not need to return to their countries of origin to obtain legal status. His position on what to do with people living in the United States illegally continues to be unclear. ___ 3:30 p.m. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are letting Ohio voters know they’re important while campaigning in Cleveland on Labor Day. Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, asked at crowd at a Labor Day festival Monday if they felt “battle-tested and ready for the home stretch.” Labor Day typically marks the final and most intense period of presidential campaigning. Ohio is a critical swing state. No Republican has won the White House without capturing the state in modern campaigns. He says Ohio voters know how to work the grassroots to win on Election Day. Clinton, meanwhile, said Ohioans know firsthand the importance of selecting a president, noting President Barack Obama’s bailout of the auto industry that saved jobs in the state. “I’m not taking anything for granted, that’s why we’re here today.” ___ 3:20 p.m. Hillary Clinton is having a rough start to her Labor Day rally, battling a stubborn cough. The Democratic nominee took the stage in Cleveland coughing uncontrollably, before turning it into a joke about her opponent, Donald Trump: “Every time I think about Trump I get allergic.” Several people in the crowd began shouting “get her some water.” She battled through the cough and delivered her speech with some difficulty. Both Clinton and Trump are in Ohio courting voters in this critical swing state. ___ 3:00 p.m. Former President Bill Clinton says the Clinton Foundation is doing good work around the world and says his wife’s political opponents are trying to distract voters from the issues by raising questions about the organization. Clinton spoke Monday to the annual AFL-CIO Labor Day picnic at the Coney Island amusement park near Cincinnati. Based on the records released so far, the AP found that more than half the people outside the government who met or spoke by telephone with Hillary Clinton during her tenure as a Cabinet secretary had given money — either personally or through companies or groups — to the Clinton Foundation. The AP’s analysis focused on people with private interests and excluded her meetings or calls with U.S. federal employees or foreign government representatives. Bill Clinton gave examples of Clinton Foundation partner projects, including with Cincinnati-based consumer products company Procter & Gamble Co. He says P&G’s clean water initiative has provided billions of water-purifying packets to help give safe drinking water in poor countries. He asked: “Is there something wrong with that?” ___ 1:25 p.m. Donald Trump’s immigration speech in Arizona last week may have gotten mixed reviews, but Trump says it was the “enthusiasm of the crowd” that inspired him. Speaking to reporters on his private plane in Ohio Monday, Trump said of his tough talk on immigration, “Some people loved it; A lot of people loved it.” The Republican nominee has come under heavy criticism for flip-flopping on the issue of immigration. Some Hispanic leaders who have been advising his campaign also said they feel betrayed after his long-awaited immigration speech that definitively ruled out a pathway to legal status for people living in the country illegally. Trump said Monday, “We had a very big crowd. It was unbelievably enthusiastic.” The speech was delivered on the heels of his visit to Mexico, where he held a joint press conference with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. The two said they discussed a number of issues on that visit, but not Trump’s controversial proposal to have Mexico pay for a border wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. ___ 1:20 p.m. Donald Trump says he plans to take part in all three presidential debates against rival Hillary Clinton. The Republican nominee was rumored to be considering skipping at least one of the debates. But he told journalists aboard his private plan in Ohio on Monday that only something along the lines of a hurricane or natural disaster would keep him from participating. “I look forward to the debates,” Trump told reporters, saying he regards them as “an important element of what we’re doing.” As for preparation, Trump says he does not believe in doing mock debates, as is tradition for many candidates, saying, “I’ve seen people do so much prep work that when they get out there they can’t speak.” The first debate between the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees is scheduled to take place on Monday Sept. 26. ___ 1:20 p.m. Donald Trump has allowed a handful of journalists on his private airplane on the same day that his rival Hillary Clinton invited journalist to join her on her new campaign plane for the first time. Trump spoke with journalists Monday in Ohio before leaving his morning stop in Cleveland for Youngstown. The Cleveland Airport offered a glimpse of how critical the fight for Ohio has become in the lead-up to the general election, as airplanes for both party nominees and their running mates were parked on the tarmac Monday morning. Trump told reporters that he is open to inviting them on his plane more often. The billionaire businessman has repeatedly criticized Clinton for not holding a news conference since last year. ___ 1:00 p.m. Donald Trump’s campaign manager says there is a “very organized” effort underway to target Democrats in Ohio and beyond. Kellyanne Conway said Monday that “voters who traditionally have not voted Republican or haven’t even voted in a very long time seem to be coming out to support” Trump and his message. Trump was in Cleveland on Labor Day with Democratic Mayor Tom Coyne, of Brook Park, Ohio, who said he supported Trump in this spring’s Republican primary and would vote for him this fall. Conway said Coyne’s support for Trump is “just one example of what’s happening across this country.” ___ 12:25 p.m. Former President Bill Clinton is warning organized labor that Donald Trump’s economic policies would cause millions of Americans to lose their jobs. Clinton campaigned Monday for his wife, Hillary Clinton, at a United Auto Workers picnic in Detroit after walking in a Labor Day parade. He said that when the country last adopted Republican policies that cut taxes on the rich and raised the debt, “it didn’t work out too well for us.” Bill Clinton says his wife’s economic plan would create 10.5 million jobs while Trump’s would cut 3.5 million jobs. He is urging union members to support Hillary Clinton “because she has the best ideas.” He questions Trump’s leadership and says his visit last week to Mexico “damaged America in every serious country in the world.” He says Trump played nice only to return home “to dump on them” for his own political benefit. ___ 12:05 p.m. Donald Trump says he would have refused to meet with Chinese officials if they treated him like they treated President Barack Obama over the weekend. The Republican presidential highlighted the issue as he met with labor leaders Monday in suburban Cleveland. Trump noted that Obama couldn’t use his traditional staircase to exit Air Force One when he arrived in China over the weekend. The president used an alternative exit instead, something Trump described as “a metal staircase in the back of the plane.” Trump called it “a sign of such disrespect.” “If that were me,” Trump said, “I’d say, ‘You know what folks, I respect you a lot, let’s close the doors, let’s get out of here.’” Obama has downplayed the issue. ___ 11:55 a.m. Donald Trump says America’s manufacturing jobs are “going to hell.” The Republican presidential nominee blamed the Obama administration for allowing companies to move jobs to Mexico. He also lashed out at the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership as “a catastrophe.” The New York billionaire made the comments during a Monday round table discussion with labor leaders in suburban Cleveland. He’s spending Labor Day campaigning alongside running mate Mike Pence in battleground Ohio. The pair met with about a dozen current and retired union members, including teamsters, steelworkers, plumbers, police patrolmen and firefighters. Trump noted that he’s often best known for immigration, but he’s also focused on jobs and the economy. “We’re going to stop companies from leaving,” Trump vowed. He said it’s going to be “so easy.” ___ 9:55 a.m. Vice President Joe Biden says there’s still work to be done to revive the American economy. Campaigning in Pittsburgh Monday alongside vice presidential hopeful Tim Kaine, Biden told a crowd of union workers that the policies of President George W. Bush deeply hurt the economy and crippled job growth. He said the Obama administration “got the truck outta the ditch,” but that it’s still not going as fast as it could be. ___ 9:45 a.m. Vice President Joe Biden is praising Tim Kaine, his possible successor, as a man who is highly qualified for the job and capable of handling any challenge that Hillary Clinton may throw his way. Biden joined Kaine in Pittsburgh for a Labor Day event Monday, where they addressed several hundred union workers. He said, “Hillary is really going to need him...because the plate is so full.” Biden said Kaine has more experience that any vice presidential nominee in the past, something Democrats frequently say about Clinton in her quest for the presidency. He said he expects Clinton and Kaine to build a partnership similar to the one he’s built with President Barack Obama, if they are elected. Biden also described Kaine as a strong friend of organized labor, saying “no one has to tell Tim who built this country.” ___ 9:20 a.m. Tim Kaine is making Labor Day personal as he campaigns alongside Vice President Joe Biden, the man he hopes to replace in the White House. Speaking to a crowd of several hundred in Pittsburgh Monday, Kaine shared the story of his father’s iron-welding business in Kansas City. He told supporters his father built a “partnership” with his employees, teaching Kaine and his brothers the value of shared prosperity. He said Democrats believe in management and unions working together, not against each other. Hillary Clinton’s father also ran a small business. Kaine said that as the children of business owners, both he and Clinton have a unique perspective toward the value of labor. He said, “We haven’t been sitting in an ivory tower.” Biden is also expected to speak at the Pittsburgh rally. ___ 8:00 a.m. Hillary Clinton is traveling aboard a new Boeing 737 campaign plane for the first time this Labor Day. Clinton was flying to events in Ohio and Illinois on Monday in a light blue-and-white campaign plane with her press corps. The plane has Clinton’s slogan “Stronger Together” on the side and her “H’’ logo on the tail. Clinton has traveled mostly by private jet during the campaign and has not held a formal news conference with journalists since December 2015 in Iowa. ___ 3:30 a.m. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are making competing Labor Day pitches in Ohio, setting the stage for a critical month in their testy presidential campaign. The Republican real estate mogul is joining running mate Mike Pence at a morning round-table discussion with union members in Cleveland. The Democratic nominee plans to arrive in the city for a Labor Day festival with union leaders and workers. Trump is also expected to campaign at a fair in Youngstown, Ohio, in a nod to the state’s role as a make-or-break proving ground for Republican presidential candidates. Labor Day has traditionally been the kickoff to the fall campaign. Both Clinton and Trump have been locked in an intense back-and-forth throughout the summer. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

"She never got anything done in Washington- as First Lady, as senator, as Secretary of State – without the strong support from Democrats and Republicans,'' Clinton told the crowd at the annual Cincinnati AFL-CIO Labor Council picnic. Her opponent, Donald Trump, and his Republican allies, Clinton said, "have to demonize her. But there is nothing that they can say or do to make her close the door on open honest, negotiations." Bill Clinton also defended the Clinton Foundation, a charity he founded after leaving the White House. Hillary Clinton has been accused of giving close access to foundation donors when she was Secretary of State. "He even went after my foundation,'' Clinton said. ""I was sort of a Robin Hood, but I didn't rob anybody. I took money from people who had a lot of money and spent it on people who needed it." He used as an example Cincinnati-based Procter & Gamble, which he said funded "billions and billions" of clean water packs for people in Africa. "Is there something wrong with that?,'' Clinton asked, to the cheers of the crowd. President Clinton's speech took place in the picnic grounds, where several thousand union members and their families had gathered for their annual Labor Day picnic.  (He spoke for about a half hour) The speech was only a stone's throw away from the spot where, on Labor Day in 1992, presidential candidate Bill Clinton, delivered a campaign speech that was filmed by a Hollywood production crew and ended up in a campaign commercial that year. Entering the day, Real Clear Politics, a website that tracks national polling, had Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump nationwide by 3.9 percentage points – by no means an insurmountable lead but usually the candidate who leads in the polls on Labor Day ends up winning the election. But, then again, this is a most unusual election. Dave Baker, business manager of Ironworkers Local 44, said he'll be nervous about this presidential election "up until it is over." "We're in a fight; there is no question about it,'' Baker said. "It's a fight we can win, but we are going to have to work hard every day between now and then." Hamilton County, Baker said, is a "critical county in a critical state. We are trying to reach people, one voter at a time." He said that when his union members encounter someone who might be inclined to vote for Trump, "we just tell them that the record speaks for itself. He has absolutely no record of fighting for working people. Hillary Clinton has a lifetime of fighting for us." The former president was in downtown Detroit Monday morning, marching in organized labor's annual Labor Day parade. Hillary Clinton had campaign events in Cleveland and Illinois. Trump, on the other hand, was in the Mahoning Valley of Ohio Monday.   Tags:  Politics Howard Wilkinson Hillary Clinton Bill Clinton TweetShareGoogle+Email View the discussion thread. © 2016 WVXU Cincinnati Public Radio Program Schedule Our Community Calendar Contact Us WVXU's Democracy and Me for Educators Privacy Policy and Terms of Use

Acosta finds a chill at the Capitol 1:08 AM by Dominic Sisti, PhD and Andrea Segal, MS, University of Pennsylvania Twitter icon @PublicsHealth Close icon The Public's Health   Twitter icon @PublicsHealth Back to school lunacy is upon us.  Parents with kids in tow will raid retail outlets, snatching up the latest gadgets, backpacks, brand name clothes, and sneakers.  Many will schedule every minute of their child’s day for the next nine months. Kids will be signed up for soccer, gymnastics, instrument lessons, play dates, and academic enrichment work.  What most likely won’t be a highlight on kids’ harried calendars: enough time for healthy sleep. In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics published, “Let them Sleep,” a report that recommended among other things delaying start times for middle and high school students to 8:30am, at the earliest.   Later start times would align the natural rhythms of children and adolescents, and hopefully afford them with 8.5-9.5 hours of necessary sleep.  Sleep deprivation among kids and adolescents increases risks associated with obesity, depression, cognitive performance and driving.  Sleep should be considered alongside nutrition. Would school boards ever approve of serving cheese fries, Twinkies, and Coke for lunch? That menu is essentially analogous to a 7am start time. It is downright unhealthy.   The scientific data are in, so why haven’t things changed? Because we live in a culture where sleep has been hyper-moralized.  Like obesity, addiction, and depression, the need for sleep is understood as a vicious moral weakness rather than what it actually is— a critical physiological process required for maintaining overall health and well-being. The need for sleep is highly stigmatized and sleep disorders often cluster around mental illness, obesity, and other ethically fraught health conditions. Historically, sleep has generally not been considered alongside other serious public health issues. In the US, sleep is generally considered to be a quotidian and habitual part of everyday life that wastes precious time.  Sleep apnea, for example, is a serious medical condition that has only recently been recognized by mainstream medicine and primary care providers.   Despite calls from the Institute of Medicine, very few medical schools include even a modest number of hours on sleep disorders in their curricula. This lack of physician training has led to over 40 million Americans undiagnosed, misdiagnosed, and untreated for sleep disorders. An attitude of indifference toward sleep health defines high performance jobs, where toughness, stamina, and grit are considered basic qualifications. In the presidential election, sleep deprivation has been cast as heroic, while a purported need for sleep is weak.  Branches of the military, for example, embrace an ethos of performance enhancement through controlled sleep deprivation. Pilots have long been issued amphetamines and modafinil –drugs used to allow soldiers to stay awake sometimes for days at a time.  It remains unclear what the long-term impact of sleep deprivation, modafinil and other anti-sleep interventions have had on the health of soldiers and veterans, but it is unlikely to be good.  Mental illnesses such as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety are more common among veterans who have experienced disturbed sleep and report symptoms of insomnia and sleep deprivation. Similarly, the culture of medicine is anti-sleep. The structure of medical education is built upon a presumption that trainees will be sleep deprived for years, especially during residency.  It is true that things have improved as work hours have been reduced, but oftentimes, overworked residents are left with no other option than to fudge the numbers so that their training programs remain in compliance with the 2011 duty hour regulations put forth by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.  Work hour restrictions are mostly aimed at enhancing patient safety and overlook the health concerns of young doctors.  However, sleep schedules that result from periodic and often random night swings have been shown to have long-term adverse consequences. In traditional corporate settings, the idea of “nap rooms” seems ridiculous— to get ahead there is simply no time for sleep.  The Society for Human Resource Management found in 2013 that only 6% of companies had employee nap rooms.  Progressive businesses are recognizing the fact that they and their employees simply cannot afford sleep deprivation.    Companies like Google, Nike, Proctor and Gamble, and Huffington Post all provide the time and space for employees to nap.  Some even use “energy pods” – futuristic white capsules where employees can lay back and catch a power nap during the day.  These companies see the bottom line value in investing in well-rested and refreshed employees.   The economic impact of sleep deprivation is staggering.  A 2011 study found that insomnia costs the U.S. workforce $63.2 billion in productivity losses in a given year, not to mention increased health care spending from individuals with sleep loss. Sleep loss results in cognitive impairments, including deficits in attention, vigilance, and memory, and chronic sleep deprivation is associated with poorer mental health status, resulting in depression and anxiety. Poverty and sleep deprivation are also connected.  A 2011 study by Patel and others found that sleep health was significantly reduced in the poor.  It is difficult to determine causation: does poverty mediate poor sleep quality, or does poor sleep quality lead to poverty? Probably both.  Regardless, it is clear that without intervention, sleep deprivation has an enormous impact on one’s health, well-being, and ability to successfully build a stable life above the poverty line. Despite the facts, sleep is still viewed as a luxury or a sign of laziness rather than being akin to potable water and nutrition— the basic public health necessity that it truly is.    While there has been some progress, there is still a long way to go to elevate the importance of sleep in both policy and practice. In the 1990’s, smoking bans seemed novel, but now smoke free public spaces are normal.  That process required a slow but steady effort to change the public’s attitude. Likewise, attitudes about sleep must be transformed through education and public policies that encourage healthy sleep.   But to make real headway in rationalizing our nation’s attitude toward sleep, we need to start with our kids.  Let’s not continue to subject them to the insidiously destructive structure of ridiculously early school start times.    It is time to think creatively about providing the necessary hours of sleep to our kids, to provide them with immediate benefits and to engender healthy sleep habits for adulthood.  Dominic Sisti is Director of the Scattergood Program for Applied Ethics of Behavioral Health Care and Assistant Professor of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at Penn.

DDB Mudra's campaign for Indian food brand Nutralite leveraged the popularity of Ganesh, incentivising people to eat more healthily, while Leo Burnett India's work for Bajaj Motorcycles honed in on Indians' sense of national pride. Multinationals such as Nestlé, Mars, P&G, Lego, Vodafone, Amazon and Unilever are well represented, alongside non-profits such as Make Love Not Scars, Love Yourself and The Akanksha Foundation, which was also shortlisted for the Warc Prize for Social Strategy and was featured in the 2016 Warc 100. “This year's shortlist demonstrates the very best in smart strategic thinking delivering awesome business results," said Sanjeeb Chaudhuri, global head of brand and chief marketing officer, Standard Chartered Bank and chair of the judging panel. “The wide range of brands, categories and markets represented is a fitting testament to the reputation within the industry that the Warc Prize for Asian Strategy has built since its inception in 2011," he added.

português suomeksi svenska US Industrial & Institutional (I&I) Cleaning Chemicals Market News provided by Reportlinker Sep 06, 2016, 15:46 ET Share this article NEW YORK, Sept. 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --   Healthcare market to grow fastest The healthcare market for I&I cleaning chemicals in the US comprises almost half of demand for all institutional and government markets due to its many facilities and intensive use of cleaning chemicals. A serious push to reduce healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) will strengthen demand in nearly all product categories, making the healthcare market the fastest growing market for I&I cleaning chemicals. On the other hand, a decrease in the number and capacity of hospitals in favor of smaller outpatient facilities will hinder growth, as hospitals are the most intensive users of cleaning chemicals. Food trucks & fast casual restaurants drive demand Growth in I&I chemicals will be fueled by further expansion of foodservice revenues and the continued increases in the number of establishments, particularly food trucks and fast casual restaurants. Concerns about food safety and public perception of cleanliness will drive advances, although some business owners will strive to reduce expenses by eliminating wasted chemicals. Dispensers that automatically dilute the product or produce a premeasured quantity will continue to penetrate the market and limit growth by preventing excess usage of cleaning chemicals. Milder fragrances & formulations Cleaning chemical formulations utilized in janitorial applications will tend toward gentler fragrances and milder formulations when possible, particularly in facilities heavily visited by the public. Growth opportunities will exist for I&I chemicals marketed as natural or containing plant-based ingredients, although this shift will not be as marked as within the household market. Multipurpose products that reduce labor will be favored, as will strong concentrates that require less storage space and infrequent replenishment. Drug-resistant bacteria concerns affect product mix An emerging concern in these materials is drug-resistant bacteria. Some biocides are under scrutiny by both regulatory bodies and the general public. In particular, triclosan is currently under review by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) due to potential health effects. Widespread usage of triclosan-based hand cleansers is a possible contributor to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. Study coverage Industrial & Institutional (I&I) Cleaning Chemicals presents historical demand data (2005, 2010, 2015) plus forecasts (2020, 2025) by market (industrial, commercial, institutional), product and raw material (biocides, solvents, chlor-alkalis, surfactants, phosphates, other). This study also considers key market environment factors, assesses the industry structure, evaluates company market share and profiles 39 competitors in the US industry, including Clorox, Ecolab, Procter & Gamble, Sealed Air (Diversey Care) and Zep. Freedonia's market research studies provide timely access to reliable, unbiased analysis from which to benchmark performance and answer critical questions: Is your business growing faster or slower than the overall market? Is your organization gaining or losing market share? Which products and markets are the most desirable to explore for expansion? Are there industry trends or competitor activities that present a threat or opportunity to your business? Studies offer a great ROI and can help business leaders make informed, analytically driven decisions.

Sign up for The Power Lunch: Florida Politics newsletter - our must-read, weekday roundup of Florida political news and buzz >> Health FDA bans soaps claiming to contain antibacterial properties Selima Hussain Washing your hands with soap and water is one of the best ways to stop the spread of germs. Privacy Policy You may want to think twice before buying soap that claims to kill 99.9 percent of bacteria. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Friday banned soaps with certain “antibacterial” or “antimicrobial” properties, saying there is not enough proof to show the claims are actually true. The organization also barred companies from marketing soaps containing one or more of 19 active ingredients – most commonly, triclosan and triclocarbon. “Consumers may think antibacterial washes are more effective at preventing the spread of germs, but we have no scientific evidence that they are any better than plain soap and water,” Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. The FDA first proposed a rule back in 2013, after finding that long-term exposure to active ingredients in antibacterial soaps could lead to health problems such as bacterial resistance and hormonal issues. The agency prompted manufacturers to send data and clinical studies proving these antibacterial washes were significantly better than non-antibacterial washes in terms of reducing infection. In the three years following, the FDA received either no evidence or insufficient evidence to back up the health claims. Now, manufacturers will have one year to remove products marketed with these active ingredients. Some companies, like Proctor & Gamble, have already started removing the chemicals from soap products. The FDA’s rule doesn’t apply to hand sanitizer or wipes. When soap isn’t available, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend using sanitizer containing at least 60 percent alcohol to stop the spread of germs.   Sticking with good, old-fashioned soap and water, however, is one of the FDA’s main recommendations.    “Washing with plain soap and running water remains one of the most important steps consumers can take to avoid getting sick and to prevent spreading germs to others,” the statement said.

(*this news item will not be available after 12/01/2016) Friday, September 2, 2016 FRIDAY, Sept. 2, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is banning most antibacterial soaps and body washes currently on store shelves, arguing that the products create potential health risks but don't perform any better than plain old soap and water. The ban covers soaps and body washes containing triclosan and triclocarban, the two most common antibacterial ingredients, the FDA says. Another 17 active ingredients also are included in the ban. "Most consumer wash products labeled 'antibacterial' or 'antimicrobial' contain at least one of the antibacterial ingredients addressed in this final rule," said Dr. Theresa Michele, director of the Division of Nonprescription Drug Products at the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. There are more than 2,100 antibacterial soaps sold today, representing about 40 percent of the overall soap market, Michele said during a media briefing Friday. The agency said it took this action over concerns that antibacterial soaps might be contributing to bacterial resistance. In the United States, at least 2 million people a year become infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and at least 23,000 die from these infections, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The FDA also noted other health concerns related to long-term use of the now-banned active ingredients. For example, recent studies have shown that triclosan can affect the thyroid, estrogen and testosterone systems of mammals, which could have implications for human health, the agency reported in its final rule. At the same time, manufacturers failed to show that their antibacterial products are any better than ordinary soap and water at preventing the spread of germs, the FDA said. People should remain diligent about washing their hands with regular soap and water "to avoid getting sick and prevent the spread of germs, especially during the start of the school year," Michele said. The new ban does not cover hand sanitizer gels or wipes, which are not used with water and often contain alcohol as the active ingredient. It also does not cover antiseptics used in health care settings, the FDA said. If soap and water aren't available, the CDC recommends that people use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60 percent alcohol. Manufacturers have one year to comply with the ban, although the FDA noted that many have already started phasing out triclosan, triclocarban and other active ingredients. Both Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson announced prior to the ban that they are phasing out triclosan, Michele said. The FDA estimates that this ban will reduce Americans' exposure to these active ingredients by 2.2 million pounds per year. Triclosan is most often included in liquid soap, while triclocarban is found in bar soaps, Michele said. The ban first was proposed by the FDA in 2013. At that time, the agency required manufacturers to provide additional data on the safety and effectiveness of the active ingredients in their antibacterial soaps, if they wanted to keep those products on the market. In terms of effectiveness, the manufacturers had to prove to the FDA that antibacterial soaps worked better than plain soap and water at preventing the spread of germs or reducing infections. The FDA is deferring the proposed ban one year for three other ingredients used in consumer wash products, based on promises from industry to provide more evidence, Michele said. Antibacterial soaps containing benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride and chloroxylenol will remain on the market while manufacturers develop additional safety and effectiveness data for these ingredients, she said.

The report forecasts the global online beauty and personal care market to grow at a CAGR of 16.70% during the period 2016-2020. The report has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. Rise in demand for dermocosmetic products will be a key trend for market growth. Dermocosmetics are products that combine cosmetic action with dermatological functions. It is a branch of dermatology concerned with the aesthetic appearance of the skin. The segment has doubled in the last 15 years, from 2.2% to 4.4% of the global beauty market. Western Europe represents almost 60% of the dermocosmetics market. Currently, France is the market leader in terms of revenue, followed by Italy, Germany, and Spain. Worldwide demand for dermocosmetic products has grown in the last five years. According to the report, one of the key drivers for market growth will be high rate of internet and smartphone penetration and increase in online spending. As of 2014, the internet penetration rate (percentage-to-population) in the US was 87.4%. Approximately 279 million people in the US were internet users; this number is the third-largest globally, after China and India. Users in the US spend more time online per capita than other users globally. An average US internet user spends more than 90 hours online per week, which is almost five times the global average. Also, broadband penetration in the country has increased recently with the growth of both fixed and wireless broadband connections. This high amount of time spent by US consumers online is encouraging beauty and personal care marketers to expand their product offerings through digital platforms. Further, the report states that increasing webrooming will be a challenge for the market.

However, there is an adage, too, that mid-caps have always been about bottom fishing. If one can pick good stocks, which can transform into large-caps, the returns can be exciting. Here are 10 mid-cap stocks which reported a decent set of earnings in FY16 and continued to do so in the June quarter, or Q1 of FY17. These had revenue and net profit growth of 11 per cent to 40 per cent in FY16, compared to the eight per cent average revenue and profit growth of companies constituting the S&P BSE Midcap index. Importantly, they are also expected to do well over the next two years. Click here for details about these 10 stocks Although the valuations for some of these (Page Industries, Procter & Gamble, Bajaj Finance) companies are high as has been the case historically, it is largely due to their high earnings growth visibility. Unless these companies falter on growth or external and domestic factors play spoilsport, analysts expect them to do well.

CINCINNATI (WKRC) - Former president Bill Clinton told the crowd at the AFL-CIO Labor Day picnic at Coney Island why he thinks Hillary Clinton is the best person to be president. He began by reminding the crowd he was at Coney Island 24 years ago when he was running for president in 1992. He says campaign season was almost as crazy then as it is now. He called on Ohio to vote for Hillary Clinton in the general election like it has voted for Clintons in the past. "I was grateful in '92, in '96 and when you voted for Hillary in the primary." Clinton didn't avoid controversy. He spoke about the flap over the Clinton Foundation. "I'm like Robin Hood but I don't rob anyone. I ask people with money to help people without money. I use that money around the world to create jobs and save lives." He cited a long-running partnership with Procter and Gamble to provide clean water packets in remote villages in Africa as an example. He also spoke of how the foundation has worked with two drug companies to greatly reduce the price of Naloxone, also known as Narcan, to get it to first responders and hospitals. He talked about how the highest addiction rates are in small towns in rural American with the worst economies. He said Hillary has a ten billion dollar plan to bring treatment and prevention programs all over America to concentrate on areas "left out and left behind". Clinton spoke to the union crowd about Hillary's plan to make college affordable for everyone. She also wants to make it so people can refinance student loan debt and limit monthly payments. She also wants to make it easier to get small business loans. Clinton asked the crowd to "Give us another 1992. Give us another 2012 when you came through for President Obama.

In this report, Technavio covers the market outlook and growth prospects of the globalbaby laundry detergentmarketfor 2016-2020. The market is further categorized into three product segments, including baby laundry detergent liquid, baby laundry detergent powder, and baby laundry detergent tablet, of which the detergent liquid segment dominated the market with more than 71% of the overall market share in 2015. "The global baby laundry detergent market has seen many new products such as detergent boosters, laundry pre-washes, laundry starch additives, and fabric protectors. While laundry detergent tablets and pre-measured pod detergents is opening up new opportunities for the market, refillable liquid detergents and fabric care products have been gaining popularity," says Brijesh Kumar Choubey, a lead retail goods and services research expert from Technavio. Product packaging is crucial to differentiating products in retail spaces. Manufacturers are focusing on packaging innovations to enhance convenience of product use and handling. In most developing markets, fragrance is an important attribute of laundry care products, contrasting with the nature of current demand in developed countries. Slow-release technology has also been developed for laundry products, which allows the fragrance to last for up to one week after washing. Companies have also launched products that give customers an option to mix different fragrances while washing. Instances are Downy Infusions and Unstoppables and Dreft Blissful In-Wash Scent Booster. To meet customer requirements, manufacturers offer combo packaging and bundle pricing on these products.

Technavio's research study segments the global baby laundry detergent market into the following regions: Americas APAC EMEA In 2015, with a market share of over 35%, EMEA dominated the global baby laundry detergent market, followed by the Americas with over 33% and APAC with about 32%. Baby laundry detergent market in EMEA The baby laundry detergent market in EMEA will account for a market share of almost 36% by 2020. UK, France, and Ireland are the key leading countries in the global organic laundry detergents market in this region. Organic detergents are more commonly used for newly born babies due to their skin's sensitiveness. "The region has significant potential for expansion, particularly in Africa and Eastern Europe. Product penetration and awareness is significantly low in these areas. Countries like South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, and Bahrain present significant growth opportunities to vendors as they have steady economies and considerable penetration of international consumer goods vendors," says Brijesh. Baby laundry detergent market in the Americas The baby laundry detergent market in the Americas will account for a market share of over 31% by 2020, growing at a CAGR of about 4%. The US dominated the global organic laundry detergents market in North America. The demand for organic laundry care products for babies has grown considerably over the last five years. Do-it-yourself (DIY) organic laundry care procedures have also gained popularity in the North American market. P&G and Church Dwight are key vendors in the US and offer brands such as Tide, Gain, and Downy. The demand for baby laundry detergent tablets has been growing in the country. However, concerns about child safety will dictate forthcoming packaging and product changes. Baby laundry detergent market in APAC APAC houses some of the fastest-growing economies worldwide, including China, Japan, and India, and will see considerable growth in the adoption of baby laundry detergents over the forecast period. The growing population of the region, the availability of improved facilities and products for hygiene and sanitation, and increasing awareness of the harmful effects of the chemicals used in daily use products are factors that have further ensured that the populace increasingly adopts safe laundry care products, particularly for babies. The baby laundry detergents market in APAC will grow at a CAGR of 5.24% during the forecast period. Despite its low birth rate, Japan stands out as one of the key leading countries in the market, primarily on the back of demand for higher-cost products. The high infant population in some of the developing countries of the region has ensured that the market will have a significant consumer base over the next five years. The top vendors in the global baby laundry detergents market highlighted in the report are: Chicco Church Dwight Henkel Pigeon P&G Browse Related Reports: Global Liquid Detergent Chemicals Market 2016-2020 Global Organic Laundry Detergents Market 2016-2020 Global Water Soluble Film Market 2016-2020 Do you need a report on a market in a specific geographical cluster or country but can't find what you're looking for?

How does this work? September 5, 2016 9:32 AM   Subscribe Feeling like my first master's was a waste, I'm pursuing an MBA and considering a career change. If this sounds like something you've done, I have some questions for you below. I've been working in administrative organizations at various public universities for eight years in progressively responsible roles. I've got an MA in Higher Ed Administration that didn't teach me how to administer much of anything, and I've enrolled in an MBA program. I'm in my first of 6 semesters. Feeling like I'll be less pigeonholed in the future, I'm seriously considering a career change (reasons: pay that probably can never match the demanding nature of my job, general frustration with universities on the whole, quotidian workplace-specific frustrations, etc.). Do you have experience with something like this? If so, I want to hear from you. My considerations right now include, but are not limited to, the following: - I've never not worked at a public or private nonprofit organization. What educational credentials/experience am I going to need to emphasize? What cultural differences should I expect between workplaces? - How do other people find jobs at... not-colleges? I know exactly where to find jobs at universities, but in other industries... LinkedIn? - How do I decide where I want to work? I mean, if you asked me as a child what I wanted to be when I grew up, I wouldn't have said (just examples), "I want to analyze datasets for Procter & Gamble," or "I want to manage operations for a luxury furniture brand," yet the jobs are available, and people wind up in them. Do I find a job description and benefits I like and roll the dice on the company? Or should I have a specific company in mind? - Bonus question: as I'm looking for jobs outside higher education, should I remove my first master's from my resume in order to appear slightly less locked into a single work environment? posted by schooley to Work & Money (3 answers total) 7 users marked this as a favorite   I've done a career change but, with the warning that I've not done an MBA, I'd suggest the following. First, congrats on starting a new degree. You've now got six semesters to network the hell out of your fellow students and any other people you might meet via workshops, seminars, and whatever it is that business people do. I suggest having a really well polished LinkedIn profile and business cards at the ready for when you meet people. Networking and recruiting events is where, I suspect, the majority of job finding takes place these days. Second, I wouldn't erase parts of your background, especially an entire degree. Your power lies in what makes you unique, including your education, experiences and skills you've learned at various jobs, and your life experiences. I think your goal should be to stand out in some way rather than trying to perfectly fit the mold of an idealized MBA student. Third, I'd think about what things you can do in the context of your current job to prepare you for a new job. It might be as simple as trying to get certain relevant or otherwise useful assignments, taking advantage of training opportunities, and so on. You've got some time and, since you work for a big organization, you've probably got access to some good resources as well. Best wishes to you. posted by LastOfHisKind at 10:22 AM on September 5 [2 favorites] FWIW, most people I know who have an MBA said it didn't teach them much about administration either. It was mostly finance and economics, and the emphasis was on people working for consulting or financial firms. If that's what you want to do, great! If not, maybe talk with some alumni to make sure the program is going to meet your career needs before getting deeper in it. Non-education sector jobs are primarily (at least in my area) found through networking. If you do pursue an MBA, view it as an opportunity to network as much as humanly possible. If you do very well, consider transferring to a top-tier MBA school (Wharton, Haas, MIT, Duke etc) to really maximize the benefits of your degree. The connections you make there will have a huge effect on the rest of your career. LinkedIn is helpful, but a strong alumni network and solid internships are just as important. The open jobs that you qualify for upon graduation (or wanting to switch jobs) are going to limit what companies you can choose from. Waiting around for that perfect spot to open up in Amazing Company X is not a good way to job search, though technically you could stay in your current field until that opens up, but having actual experience in the new field will make you a more appealing candidate. You can have your dream list, and check periodically to see if they are hiring for someone like you, but don't limit yourself to only that list or you will have an even harder time job hunting. Do not leave off your MA. That's a huge asset, not a bug. Keep in mind that public job listings are a last resort for most companies. They will prioritize internal hires and referrals from current employees before seeking a recruiter or listing the job anywhere. Often the job listing is merely lip service to demonstrate their "equal opportunity hiring" policies. Hence, the more robust your network, the more likely you will be one of the referred candidates. Best of luck! posted by ananci at 2:06 PM on September 5 [1 favorite] Whenever I look for jobs, I pick a keyword for something that I'm interested in, add "jobs" to the end of it, and throw it into Google. This will typically round up the usual job search websites (Monster, Indeed, and yes, LinkedIn to a degree) but may also turn up some local search engines or organizations that specialize in finding a more specific type of job or a local place that's currently hiring for a job with those parameters. This could be a good way to get started, but if you're doing an MBA program, DEFINITELY network like crazy. If nothing else, you'll learn more about the prominent companies that might be hiring MBAs and you can seek opening specifically through their job portals. Way to go on the career change!

Lisa Baumgartner works on client accounts for Drs. Sauer and Leibensperger Family Practice in Pittsburgh. (Pam Panchak/Pittsburgh Post-Gazette/TNS) MINNEAPOLIS Mentorship is getting turned on its head in today’s multigenerational workplace. Technology has flipped traditional roles, and the younger workers now have a thing or two to teach the veterans. In boardrooms across the nation, “reverse mentoring” is taking root as baby boomer leaders seek out millennials to help them understand the latest in technology, social media and the fast-changing marketplace. “It’s not that older generations aren’t using technology – of course they’re texting and on Facebook,” said Debra Arbit, CEO of workplace consultant BridgeWorks. “But the fact that I got my first iPhone when I was a teenager is a very different thing than my mom, who learned how to text when she was 54.” Boomer bosses also want to hang on to these younger workers, whose sense of work-life balance and loyalty don’t match up with their own. Health care giant UnitedHealth Group sees value in turning the tables. The company, headquartered in suburban Minneapolis, rolled out a reverse mentoring program this summer that paired eight senior executives in its insurance division with eight millennials seen as “emerging leaders.” The average age gap is 25 years. “For many of our leaders – outstanding thought leaders in their own right – their connection to the millennial generation is largely through their parenting skills,” said Pete Church, vice president of human capital at UnitedHealthcare. “This becomes a fundamentally different kind of experience.” UnitedHealth’s insurance business is perceived as less innovative than its fast-growing health IT division, Optum. A reverse mentoring program could help executives see the business with fresh eyes but also shape a workplace that reflects the contrasting needs of the next generation. “We’re switching roles because we have this business problem we’re trying to solve,” Church said. The concept of reverse mentoring has been kicking around a handful of Fortune 500 circles for some time, but it has been slow to gain momentum. Credit for bringing the practice to the United States often goes to retired General Electric CEO Jack Welch, who returned from an overseas trip in 1999 and ordered his top leaders to find a junior-level mentor to teach them computer skills. Now there’s power in numbers. Millennials recently overtook baby boomers as the largest generation at work, and by 2020 they’ll be more than half of the nation’s workforce. Companies are taking a renewed interest in reverse mentorship as a business strategy. The Hartford, PwC, Cisco and Procter & Gamble are among the believers. Facebook, along with several nonprofits such as the National 4-H Council, have joined AARP’s “Mentor Up” program. At Deloitte – where a reverse mentoring initiative began with young workers teaching older employees how to use email – the benefits flow both ways. “Junior professionals” gain more exposure to top leaders and build confidence, said Minneapolis managing partner Jeff Cotton. Baby boomers rose in the ranks of a hierarchical workplace, where they were told what to do. Millennials have been shaped by social networks, where everyone is on equal footing – they’ve been able to tweet the president since they were 12. They’re comfortable giving advice, having been raised by boomer parents who consulted them on everything from how to set up the Wii console to what to eat for dinner and where to go on vacation, said BridgeWorks’ Arbit, whose company helps businesses manage the generational divide. “Millennials have always been counselors at home,” Arbit said. “And then they get to the workplace and they’re never asked their opinion? It’s such an immediate way to disengage this generation.” It seemed to make a difference for Amanda Daeges, an attorney at U.S. Bank in Minneapolis. A few years ago, Daeges was tapped to join a group of millennials inside the bank known as the “Dynamic Dozen.” Launched in 2009, the initiative draws workers in their 20s and 30s from across the company to tackle a yearlong project of their choosing aimed at serving millennial customers and younger employees. The project culminates with a formal presentation in the executive boardroom and a private lunch with U.S. Bank CEO Richard Davis. Was it stressful? “Of course!” said Daeges, now 37 and a vice president in the Minneapolis-based bank’s legal department. “But they were very interested, and I felt like our opinion was valued and considered by them. When we finished our presentation, one senior leader said, ‘That’s so simple. Why aren’t we doing this?’ And we were just trying to contain the grins on our faces.” Share this: Email Print Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Pinterest Reddit More Skype LinkedIn Pocket Tumblr Telegram Related More articles from Business jobs to cut costs after scandal FuelCell Energy to partner in carbon-capture study Electric vehicle rebate program gets more funding JPMorgan Chase to pay $264 million in Chinese bribery case Applications for US unemployment aid fall to 43-year low Average US 30-year mortgage rate jumps to 3.94 percent Ex-Valeant, Philidor execs charged with fraud, conspiracy Economists: Northwest CT manufacturers challenged by aging workforce Higher gas prices push US consumer inflation up 0.4 percent EARNINGS REPORT Applications for US unemployment aid fall to 43-year low US home construction jumps by largest amount in 34 years Carmax bringing deals Facebook apologizes for latest metrics errors Boeing to cut some jobs, move others, in efficiency effort After election rupture, CEOs seek unity for staff, customers US retail sales jump 0.8 pct. in sign of consumer health Billionaires put pop in advocates’ push for soda taxes For ECB and Fed, Trump complicates decisions on rate policy Only 3 stores opening at Mall of America on Thanksgiving American Airlines flight attendants report more problems with new uniform Child safety group releases annual list of unsafe toys Nearly 20 laid off at Waterbury Hospital Home Depot crushes it again; ups outlook for the year Trucking company settles discrimination case with Sikhs AAA predicting biggest Thanksgiving travel rush in 9 years Twitter adds new options to curb abuse, harassment New Macs, Lenovo laptop make traditional keyboards touchy Amazon looks to clean house – literally App watch: The apps you must download immediately Latest News jobs to cut costs after scandal 8 mins ago FuelCell Energy to partner in carbon-capture study 9 mins ago Electric vehicle rebate program gets more funding 9 mins ago Priscilla on life with Elvis: ‘Truly lived in a bubble’ 2 hours ago UConn men edge Marymount for first victory 13 hours ago CategoriesCategories Select Category _Posts Announcements    Anniversaries    Births    Engagements    Marriages    Reunions Blogs    City Beat    Gardening    Off The Record    Picken’ on Life    Throwback Thursday    Time Out    What’s for Dinner Campership Cartoon Columns    Active Outdoors    Beer Snob    CT-Music    Living Here    Matter Of Laugh And Death    Nature    Off Stage    Ride CT    Sunday Reflections Community Connecticut Open Entertainment    Arts    Best Bets    Entertainment Videos    Movies    Music    Nightlife    People    Theater    TV Featured Gallery    Auto Racing Photo Gallery    College Sports    Graduations    Local Sports Photos    News Gallery    NFL Photo Gallery    Social Moments    Top Sports Horoscope Lifestyle    Family    Food    Health    Lifestyle Videos    Outdoors    Technology    Travel    wheels News    Bus Routes    Business    Connecticut    Elections       Candidate Profiles       Election Videos       Local Election       National Election          US Senate and House       State Elections    Local    Morning 5    National    New England    News Videos    Offbeat    Today in History    World Obituaries Opinion    Commentary    Editorials    Letters    Syndicated Columnists    Worth Reading    Your Page Records    Courts    Inspections    Police Special    Honor rolls Sports    Athlete of the Week    Auto Racing    College    Fantasy football    Goalzone    Golf    High School    Hoopzone    Latest on The Zone    Local Sports       Local Sports Videos    MLB    NBA    NFL    NHL    Olympics    Pro Sports    Redzone    Soccer    Sports featured    Sports Gallery    Sports Videos    Strikezone    Sunday Six    The Zone test    UConn       Football       Men’s Basketball       UConn video       Women’s Basketball Top 25 football poll Top Stories Valedictorians    Valedictorians 2014    Valedictorians 2016 Videos Polls Has your child been a victim of cyber bullying?

Unilever, Beiersdorf and L'Oreal are among the multinationals converting their supply chains for the world's biggest Muslim-majority nation. The law, the first of its kind, requires food to be labeled halal or not in 2017, followed by toiletries in 2018 and medicines in 2019. The companies say demand for beauty products that are halal, or target specific issues like veiled hair, will grow as the Muslim middle class grows. They note that Indonesia could influence other countries such as Malaysia where halal products made locally or by small, niche companies are also popular. Halal certification is official recognition that a product was manufactured in keeping with Islamic Sharia law. This means it must not contain traces of pork, alcohol or blood, and must be made on factory lines free of contamination risk, including from cleaning. Makers of cosmetics and toiletries say the burden is more administrative than financial, and therefore see compliance as unlocking new revenue streams. "It's an enabler to do business in certain areas of the world," said Dirk Mampe of German chemicals company BASF , which sells ingredients to toiletries manufacturers and now has 145 of them certified halal. The halal ingredients do not carry premium price tags, he said. "There is a trend that these halal products are being requested more and more, and the importance of being able to supply them is increasing." More than 1.5 billion people around the world are Muslim, accounting for about a quarter of the global population. Halal cosmetics were estimated to make up 11 percent of a global halal market worth more than $1 trillion in 2015, according to Deloitte Tohmatsu Consulting. Market research firm TechNavio sees halal personal care products' sales growing 14 percent per year until 2019, outpacing the broader market. NOT-SO-SECRET FORMULA French cosmetics giant L'Oreal already has a halal-certified factory in Indonesia that supplies the domestic market and its Southeast Asian neighbors. Most products under its Garnier brand, from face washes to skin lightening creams, are halal-certified, a spokeswoman said. The personal care industry already depends largely on plant-derived ingredients, so the rules for halal often affect production more than formulation. But certification can get complicated. For example, the maker of an Indonesian skin cream with a dozen ingredients from around the world would need to give Indonesian authorities proof from other certification bodies that each ingredient was made in a halal way. Malaysia-based DagangHalal has made a business from that complexity by establishing an online database of halal certificates to ease their exchange and expedite the process for applicants. As of February, it said 38 out of over 120 certification bodies worldwide had signed up. The company, which also runs a halal e-commerce site, reported 2015 revenue of 5.6 million Malaysian ringgit ($1.4 million), up 64 percent year-on-year. It raised 3.6 million pounds ($4.7 million) from this year's London stock listing, and is betting that halal cosmetics will gain traction beyond their current strongholds of Indonesia and Malaysia. "Halal certification is a requirement that might be put in place by other countries in the future," Joerg Karas, general manager of Schwan-Stabilo Cosmetics, said in a statement last month. The German company, which is ready to offer halal-certified products to customers such as L'Oreal and Procter & Gamble, said it is "well-equipped for this niche market". Non-halal products will remain available in Indonesia following the labeling law, but may meet a backlash. "The average Muslim consumer in Indonesia is not going to buy something that effectively says prohibited on it," said Abdalhamid Evans of halal consultancy firm Imarat Consultants. Unilever, which owns five of Indonesia's top ten beauty and personal care brands, says all nine of its factories there already meet halal standards and that it is currently working with third-party suppliers of imported ingredients. Alan Jope, who runs Unilever's personal care business from Singapore, told Reuters the cost of certification was "not material". MUSLIM VALUES Competition with homegrown rivals steeped in local tradition can be fierce, especially when it comes to regulation. But Jope said the key for multinationals like Unilever -- with global marketing and development teams -- is understanding Muslim values generally and how they influence habits in specific markets with different cultures and ethnicities. "Some (values) are common across Muslim countries," he said, noting that about 90 percent of Muslim consumers say faith influences their brand choices. "But there's quite substantial differences between how a Muslim woman in Indonesia and a Muslim woman in Saudi Arabia express their faith and how that impacts their beauty regimes." He guessed that one third of the top twenty markets for Unilever's 20 billion euros-per-year business were countries with large Muslim populations, from India to Nigeria. He said better meeting their needs was a top strategic priority. To that end, Unilever has introduced products such as a gel body moisturizer that absorbs quickly beneath long undergarments and a long-lasting toothpaste appealing to those fasting for Ramadan. Like rival Henkel, it sells a line of shampoo for veiled hair, but Jope said the industry needs to improve its advertising, such as by featuring more women in hijabs. "We need to be doing a better job reflecting Muslim values in our brand communication," he said.

Unilever, Beiersdorf and L'Oreal are among the multinationals converting their supply chains for the world's biggest Muslim-majority nation. The law, the first of its kind, requires food to be labeled halal or not in 2017, followed by toiletries in 2018 and medicines in 2019. The companies say demand for beauty products that are halal, or target specific issues like veiled hair, will grow as the Muslim middle class grows. They note that Indonesia could influence other countries such as Malaysia where halal products made locally or by small, niche companies are also popular. Halal certification is official recognition that a product was manufactured in keeping with Islamic Sharia law. This means it must not contain traces of pork, alcohol or blood, and must be made on factory lines free of contamination risk, including from cleaning. Makers of cosmetics and toiletries say the burden is more administrative than financial, and therefore see compliance as unlocking new revenue streams. "It's an enabler to do business in certain areas of the world," said Dirk Mampe of German chemicals company BASF , which sells ingredients to toiletries manufacturers and now has 145 of them certified halal.

As World Suicide Prevention Day approaches on September 10th, 2016 fixing the problem of suicide is important -perhaps more important -than raising awareness. Expanded Men kill themselves at a rate of 3:1 relative to women of any age (ONS, 2015). Yet, men are less likely than women to actively seek help. The common misconception is that men don't want to talk. This is wrong -the messages by all and any suicide phoneline campaigns are not talking correctly to men -we know from our psychology study that men are most receptive to conversation when it is framed as a step to a goal, rather than any other approach, such as 'just talk to us' messages. Detail We had 114 men, aged between 20 and 75 take part in our online attitude, intention, and understanding questionnaire study. All participants answered the same set of questions about four posters targeted at men with mental health issues. Two of the posters were genuine campaign posters (Samaritans, Calm) depicting an individual figure, while the remaining two were created for the purpose of the study, and highlight group belonging and support. Three dimensions were explored: Factors behind a convincing poster The most encouraging poster taglines And general responsiveness to conversation versus action-based encouragement The results suggest that a convincing message relies on a combination of characteristics, including relatability, connection to anxiety, belief in change, and an outcome-focused call-to-action in form of a simple command. A sub-group of younger men was found to be more responsive to group posters. Finally, conversation and a goal-oriented, problem-solving approach were not mutually exclusive (with a slight preference for the latter), suggesting that men are likely to be the most receptive to conversation when it is framed as a step to a goal. For more http://www.thehuntingdynasty.com/2016/07/a-step-by-step-approach-to-reducing-suicide-among-men/ Quotes ready-to-go Lina Skora, Behavioural Scientist at The Hunting Dynasty - the agency that funded the research- and author and speaker on emotion and behaviour says: 1. "Help services could be doing much more to encourage men to reach out. I can understand where they're coming from now - showing understanding, recognising loneliness, anxiety, depression. And while we found these to be important components of effective messages, they're by no means sufficient, and can actually be even more isolating on their own. A substantial group of men could be deterred from calling a helpline because of it. The current approach is not exhausting the possibilities." 2. "Men do face a different set of challenges than women when it comes to psychological well-being, and we need to recognise that. If there's anywhere the gender-blind approach is failing, this is it." Oliver Payne, Founder of The Hunting Dynasty - the agency that funded the research- and author on behaviour and environment says: 1. "Men don't like to talk? That's not what our research says -they do like to talk, just not in the way current suicide language is used to drive men to phone suicide helplines. It pains me to see 'wrong' messaging whenever I walk around." 2. "Those who conceive, and commission, messages for suicide helplines are doing it for the right reasons. But, even a cursory glance at the existing psychological research would tell the marketing firms and officers they're on the wrong foot - and at least should give pause for thought, even if they can't plan and write a robust psychological study like we did to find the solution."
