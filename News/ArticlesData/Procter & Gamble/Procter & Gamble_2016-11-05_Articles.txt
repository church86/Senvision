Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Nov 6, 2016 at 1:22PM Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) just kicked off its fiscal 2017 with a bang. Organic sales rose in each of its five product divisions thanks to a good mix of higher volume and increasing prices. The healthcare segment stood out from the rest, though, with revenue growth that was far above the company's overall 3% result: Segment Organic Volume Organic Sales Beauty 2% 3% Grooming 3% 3% Healthcare 5% 7% Fabric and home care 4% 4% Baby, feminine, and family care 4% 2% Data source: Procter & Gamble. A small but important segment Healthcare is worth 11% of P&G's sales (and 12% of profits), making it a relatively small division. For perspective, fabric and home care, which sports the Tide detergent brand, is much bigger and accounts for almost one-third of sales, as does the Pampers-led baby-care segment. Image source: P&G. The healthcare division does include a few powerhouse brands, such as the Crest and Oral-B franchises that together own 20% of the global market share for toothpaste. That puts P&G in an impressive second place in this category, but still far behind leader Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) and its dominant 45% market share. Thanks in part to that leadership, Colgate was able to boost organic sales by almost 5% last quarter, besting P&G by 2 percentage points. Rounding out the major brands in the healthcare division are P&G's Prilosec and Vicks brands, which hold strong global positions in their respective markets, for treating heartburn and fighting flu symptoms. The latest results P&G managed solid growth in oral care last quarter, with especially strong volume gains in developing markets. The China geography saw big gains with Oral-B toothbrushes and toothpastes. Antiaging skin creams were also a hit there. Results were even better in the personal care niche, which expanded at a double-digit pace. In fact, P&G likely clawed back some market share from global rivals this quarter. Johnson & Johnson, for example, only managed flat health-product sales at its latest quarterly check-in. P&G's core categories. Image source: P&G investor presentation. Overall, P&G's healthcare segment's 7% organic sales jump was powered by 5% higher volumes, and a 2-percentage-point contribution from increased pricing and a more favorable mix of product sales. Yet P&G can't claim a full rebound even in its best-performing division. The company gave up 0.3 percentage points of market share last quarter, and while that's an improvement over fiscal 2016's 0.7% decline, it still amounts to lost business. P&G is still headed in the wrong direction -- just at a slower pace. Looking ahead Innovative products are the company's most effective tools for producing sustainable growth, and that's why it's such a challenge for the business that P&G hasn't managed a new billion-dollar brand launch in years. There's plenty of growth opportunities in strengthening the products it already has, though. P&G can also keep healthcare sales growth chugging along with stepped-up advertising spending and more aggressive trial product offerings. These two initiatives have been key drivers behind its growing business momentum over the last six months. It's likely that segment growth will slow over the next few quarters, given weak overall selling conditions and the fact that P&G executives expect organic sales to weigh in at 2% for the full year (for a decline from last quarter's 3% pace). Still, there's room in that forecast for the healthcare segment -- whose growth pace worsened to 2% last year from 4% in fiscal 2015 -- to achieve a decent turnaround this year.

You've seen the duck puppet pop up in the middle of those ads from time to time to squawk "Aftab!" Sort of like the duck in the Aflac commercials. And, admit it, those commercials have stuck in your head, like an ear worm of a song you can't help but hum to yourself all day. Aftab! Aftab! Aftab! It is Aftab Pureval's way of injecting a little humor in a race that is usually dull as dishwater; and to make his "foreign-sounding" name familiar and natural-sounding to voters who may be used to voting for people named "Bob" and "Jim" and "Nancy," but certainly not "Aftab." There's something a bit crazy and more than a little sad about the fact that, in 21st century America, a candidate for public office has to worry about his name sounding too "foreign." But that was a concern for the 34-year-old O'Bryonville resident, when he was mulling over the possibility of running for office in Hamilton County this year, his fellow Democrats say. His name is a source of pride for Pureval. It was given to him by a father from India and a mother who was a Tibetan refugee who fled the Chinese communists. His parents came to this country and decided to settle in, of all places, Beavercreek, Ohio. And, yes, in case you are wondering, he was born in Ohio. Which makes him eligible to run for president once he reaches the age of 35. He became student body president at The Ohio State University (often a door that, once opened, can lead to a career in politics), earned a law degree at the University of Cincinnati, worked for a time with a high-powered law firm in Washington, D.C. , where he did pro bono work representing battered women; and returned to Cincinnati to serve a special assistant U.S. attorney. These days, he is working for Procter & Gamble as the attorney for a billion-dollar brand. And, on the side, he co-owns a bar and grille in Pendleton. Honestly, how many people do you know with a resume like that at the age of 34? Probably not many. And now he is trying to add another title to that resume – Hamilton County Clerk of Courts. Pureval is taking on incumbent Republican Tracy Winkler, who was appointed to the job five years ago No easy task. Winkler is a potent name in Hamilton County politics, particularly among the throngs of Republican voters in the West Side suburbs. Tracy Winkler is part of a passel of Winklers who are serving or have served in elective office – her husband Ralph "Ted" Winkler is the county probate judge; her father-in-law, Ralph Winkler, is retired after serving decades as a judge; her brother-in-law, Robert Winkler, is a common pleas court judge; and her later mother-in-law, Cheryl Winkler, was a Green Township trustee and a state representative. Winklers just have a habit of getting elected in this county. Pureval plans to break that habit. "This office is critical to the administration of justice in Hamilton County,'' Pureval told WVXU. "This is an office with 222 employees and  $20 million budget. "Our courts are special,'' Pureval said. "This is something I have learned from being a lawyer. Our courts are the one place where what you look like or where you come from doesn't matter. They are there to do justice. And the clerk plays an important role in keeping the records of those courts." No one, even among the most ardent local Democrats, gave Pureval much of a chance in the clerk of courts race when he began his campaign over a year ago. But, when in talking to Democrats about him, each and every one has told us that they consider him to be very intelligent and very capable." Aftab Pureval Credit Provided "He is a very impressive young man,'' said Hamilton County Democratic Party chairman Tim Burke. "Everyone he meets says so." And, Burke said, he has been able to bring together elements of the party that don't always get along with each other. "He held his first event about a year ago at an art gallery downtown,'' Burke said. "John Cranley showed up. Chris Seelbach showed up. So did Mark Mallory and Roxanne Qualls. Anybody who can bring all of those people together is doing something right." Winkler did not return several phone messages left by WVXU asking to talk about her re-election campaign. You can find her campaign website here. Pureval was just plugging away, raising money and campaigning everywhere when a big, fat juicy campaign issue fell in his lap. The newspaper City Beat acquired e-mails Winkler's then-chief deputy bailiff, Donald Robinson Jr., sent to employees of the clerk's office telling them to contact the agency's human resources  director if they were willing to distribute campaign yard signs, wear Winkler T-shirts and march in a parade with other Winkler supporters. "There are plenty of events this weekend to get out and support our Keep Tracy Winkler Clerk of Courts campaign,'' Robinson wrote in one of the e-mails City Beat acquired. "As always, post your pictures to all social media." Winkler reprimanded Robinson for the e-mails, which were sent through personal e-mail accounts but during work hours. And she transferred him to a new job, safety and security manager/director, at the same salary he made as chief deputy bailiff for municipal court. This gave Pureval all the ammunition he needed. "It's been an open secret that she has turned her office into her campaign staff,'' he said. "There were employees who felt threatened by this e-mail. This kind of machine party politics has absolutely no place in the clerk of courts office. Or anywhere in county government." Pureval said if he is elected, no employee of the office will be allowed to contribute to his campaign fund and no employee will be allowed to do political work for him during office hours." He says he has big plans for the office. "I'll use the office to continue to push for a full-time housing court,'' Pureval said. "Both (Hamilton County prosecutor) Joe Deters and (Cincinnati Mayor) John Cranley say we should have it. Right now, we have a part-time housing docket. You can read more about his ideas on his campaign website. The Democrat is out-spending Winkler by about five-to-one. He's raised and spent about $350,000 on the campaign – mainly on the "Aftab duck" commercials. "We're running a full-time campaign, 12 hours a day,'' Pureval said. Winkler, he said, "is nowhere to be found. The fact is that, just because of your last name, you do not have a birthright to a job. Resting on your laurels and expecting your name to carry you through is a mistake." Pureval may be a first-time candidate, but he doesn't lack for confidence. He will tell you flat out, "I'm going to win this race." He points to Winkler's election in 2012. Winkler's opponent, Democrat Pam Thomas, had only a small fraction of the resources Pureval has, and Winkler ended up winning with just 52 percent of the vote. His campaign fund, his hard work, and the issues, he says, can make up the difference. If he doesn't win, there is no question that the local Democratic Party has found a capable candidate for future races. And, next time, he may not need the squawking duck.

JARRAD HEDES/TIMES NEWS ‹ Prev 1 of 2 Next › Compressor site for pipeline project to go before Kidder board By Jarrad Hedes jmhedes@tnonline.com UGI Energy Services officials recently touted its proactive safety measures during a tour of its compressor station in Wyoming County, the same type of facility planned for Kidder Township to serve the PennEast natural gas pipeline project. The proposed 48,000-horsepower compressor station, planned near Interstate 80 and Route 940, is scheduled to come before the Kidder Township Zoning Hearing Board on Monday. One of the member companies making up the PennEast Pipeline Company, UGI said one of its most comparable stations was built in two phases starting in 2013 in Meshoppen. “Our line here can go to homeowners, industrial facilities or businesses,” said John Stahl, superintendent of gas compression at the UGI facility. “Where the demand is, that’s where the gas goes. We supply Proctor and Gamble here in Wyoming County, and residential homes within a 10-mile stretch of our station.” Gas, which is compressed from Marcellus Shale, is given to UGI from certain contracted producers. Before it gets to the station, it is dehydrated. “We have to make sure the gas is clean so we can scrub it,” Stahl said. “After it comes out of the ground, it’s naturally wet, so we have to make sure it’s dry. We use moisture and sulfur analyzers to do the testing.” Ensuring the quality of the gas is important for UGI’s customers, but Stahl said the company also has a state-of-the-art supervisory control and data acquisition system to make sure operators know what is happening inside the station at all times. UGI’s 26 gas and 14 fire detectors help it diagnose trouble before it happens. “The infrared technology could spot the heat before there would be flames,” Stahl said. “We detect gas at 20 percent LEL (lower explosive limit) and shut the station down at 40 percent. The standard is 25 and 50 percent, but we want to make sure we never even get to that point.” During normal operations, however, Stahl said the plant runs no higher then 1 or 2 percent. Anything higher would likely indicate a leak. The 118-mile PennEast pipeline would cut through Kidder, Penn Forest, Towamensing and Lower Towamensing townships in Carbon County. Safety of the compressor station has been a main concern of opponents of the pipeline. At a recent Kidder Township supervisors meeting, Linda Christman, of the opposition group Save Carbon County, said compressor stations are more likely than pipelines to be involved in explosions. Stahl said his crew have regular hazard analysis meetings. “We go over all of the weird scenarios,” he said. What happens if this fails and then that fails and then that fails. We need to be prepared for everything. The safety of the public, our employees and our equipment has to be our top priority.” On the day of the tour, UGI moved 100 million cubic feet of gas through the station. Two of its eight compressors were running. Outside the building, noise levels run at about 55 decibels at 100 feet away from the building. “It’s louder in a normal kindergarten classroom,” said Pat Kornick, PennEast spokeswoman. “We’re able to stand here and have a normal conversation without shouting.” UGI has spent millions of dollars on sound attenuation via Noise Solutions Inc., Stahl said, and the Kidder facility would be no different. Opponents, meanwhile, warn that the stations can be “as loud as an airport.” Christman also predicted the station will generate approximately 200 metric tons of pollutants annually into a “previously pristine environment.” “The pollutants include CH20 which is primarily formaldehyde; PM10 particle pollution which is highly associated with lung cancer; PM2.5 particle pollution which is the leading cause of mortality from cardiovascular disease; benzene, a cancer-causing compound; sulfur dioxide which smells like rotten eggs and is harmful to human health; and nitric oxide, the principal component of the smog that causes acid rain,” she added. Stahl said UGI meets all state and federal guidelines, and all air emissions are well below the Environmental Protection Agency standard. The Kidder Township Zoning Hearing Board will consider PennEast’s compressor station application at 6 p.m. Monday at the Galleria at Split Rock Resort.

The Dow Jones industrial average ended about 40 points lower, with Procter & Gamble contributing the most losses. The S&P 500 fell nearly 0.2 percent and extended its losing streak to nine sessions, with consumer staples leading decliners. The S&P's losing streak is the longest in almost 36 years. During that streak, the index has fallen nearly 3 percent. The Nasdaq composite fell about a quarter of a percent. The three major indexes all posted weekly losses. "Nobody wants to do anything today. ... Everybody is on hold for Tuesday," said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. "I think next week you'll start seeing Wall Street coronate winners and losers. What I mean is you're going to start seeing investors switching sectors very quickly." The CBOE Volatility Index, widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, rose 3.76 percent to trade near 22.9. The so-called fear gauge is also up more than 40 percent this week. The race between Republican Donald Trump and his Democratic counterpart, Hillary Clinton , has become tighter since last week, when the FBI said it was investigating new emails related to Clinton. According to data from RealClearPolitics, the average spread between Clinton and trump is now just 1.7 points in a four-way race, down from about 5 points last week. "The market is pricing in a Hillary Clinton victory, but it's also been pricing in a split ticket, with Clinton taking the White House and a split in Congress," said Tom Siomades, head of Hartford Funds Investment Consulting Group. "It seems like the market is obsessed with the election," said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, adding that price movements around an election are "very much a short-term thing." On the data front, jobs in the U.S. grew by 161,000 last month , while economists polled by Reuters expected an increase of 175,000. The unemployment rate stood at 4.9 percent —in line with expectations —as investors got to digest the final payrolls report before Tuesday's presidential election. "I would consider this a middle-of-the road report. I think the interesting thing about the report is that Hurricane Matthew didn't adversely affect jobs growth. In the past, we've seen hurricanes depress jobs growth," said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor. But the bigger number in the report could be wages, with average hourly earnings climbing 10 cents and reflecting a 2.8 percent annualized increase, according to the report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "This is a pretty positive wages picture and it's what you'd expect to see with such low unemployment," Glassdoor's Chamberlain said. Investors have been paying even more attention to U.S. economic data as they try to determine the likelihood of the Federal Reserve raising rates. Hartford Funds' Siomades said this jobs report "will lock in the December rate hike," adding that any number around these levels would have been "a green light for the Fed." U.S. Treasurys traded higher, with the two-year note yield near 0.79 percent and the benchmark 10-year yield around 1.77 percent. The U.S. dollar fell against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.113 and the yen around 103. "Things are hot, when it comes to the US economy and today's number has cement that idea. You can criticise the Fed that they are thinking of increasing the interest rate when the GDP growth could be slowing for the final quarter of this year," Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said in a note. "But the fact is that the Fed is very close in achieving their GDP, inflation and unemployment target. Throughout this year, they have been aching to increase the rate," he said. In a speech, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said Fed rate hikes over the next two years would be very gradual. "I anticipate a very gradually rising interest rate environment over the next two years...I do not see rates marching higher for an extended period in a preprogrammed tightening campaign. The economy does not call for that, at least not at this time," he said. Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said in another speech that the case for a rate hike was strengthening. and Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said the labor market is strong and the central bank could overshoot its goals. In oil markets, U.S. crude prices whipsawed, settling 1.32 percent lower at $44.07 per barrel, after OPEC's secretary general denied reports of tensions resurfacing between Saudi Arabia and Iran that could scupper a key output cut deal. WTI had briefly traded positive after the news broke. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 42.39 points, or 0.24 percent, to close at 17,888.28, with Procter & Gamble leading decliners and Caterpillar the top advancer. The S&P 500 fell 3.48 point, or 0.17 percent, to end at 2,085.18, with health care leading five sectors higher and consumer staples the biggest laggard. The Nasdaq fell 12.04 points, or 0.24 percent, to 5,046.37. Advancers were a step ahead of decliners at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 902.51 million and a composite volume of 3.774 billion at the close. Gold futures for December delivery rose $1.20 to settle at $1,304.50 per ounce. — CNBC's Jeff Cox and Reuters contributed to this report.   And the Best Place to Work in the global financial markets 2016 is...

Photo: Bloomberg New York: US stocks posted their longest slide since 1980, while Treasuries rallied after data showing progress in the American labour market did little to soothe anxiety over the presidential election. Oil slumped. The S&P 500 Index dropped for a ninth straight day, a gauge of equity volatility had the longest stretch of gains on record and Treasuries climbed the most since September ahead of next week’s vote. All the jitters sent the dollar down after a brief advance that followed data showing US jobs rose at a steady pace in October, supporting a Federal Reserve hike next month. Oil sank as hopes faded that Opec will be able to implement a deal to cut output. Traders have piled into relatively safer assets as opinion polls showed the US presidential race tightening after Hillary Clinton seemed poised for victory. While American stocks have almost always risen in the days before a presidential election, anxiety about the outcome of the 8 November vote has weighed on the market this time, overshadowing key reports such as the jobs data. “The jobs number should increase rate-hike odds and push up the dollar further, but nothing is happening in the markets ahead of the election,” said Dennis Debusschere, a senior managing director and global portfolio strategist at Evercore ISI in New York. “All expectations of the rate outlook and by extension the markets are being muted by election uncertainty.” Republican nominee Donald Trump showed strength in Iowa and Ohio pre-Election Day voting, while Clinton’s advantage in early balloting looked favourable in North Carolina and Nevada, according to a Bloomberg analysis. A report on Saturday showed payrolls climbed by 161,000 last month following a 191,000 gain in September that was larger than previously estimated. Wages rose from a year earlier by the most since 2009, and the jobless rate fell to 4.9%. The figures are likely to keep the Fed on track to raise borrowing costs next month for the first time in 2016. Stocks The S&P 500 fell 0.2% to 2,085.18 at 4pm in New York, after erasing a 0.5% advance. The gauge fell to as low as 2,083, its average price during the past 200 days, and a technical level it hasn’t breached since the rout that followed the UK’s June vote to leave the European Union. The CBOE Volatility Index surged 73% in nine days. “The US elections are the elephant in the room for markets at the moment,” said Christian Gatticker, Zurich-based head of research at Julius Baer Group Ltd. “The best case is gridlock where Hillary wins and works with a Republican Congress, while a worst case is a hung vote.” Equities faded in afternoon trading as declines among consumer, financial and energy shares overshadowed gains in drugmakers. Procter & Gamble Co. and Amazon.com Inc. sank more than 1.5%. Insurer Willis Towers Watson Plc tumbled after cutting its full-year revenue forecast, and Wells Fargo & Co. lost 1.6%. Crude’s drop weighed on oil producers. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index extended its weekly slide to 3.5%, the biggest since February. Erste Group Bank AG sank after Austria’s biggest bank forecast lower profitability next year. Commerzbank AG slipped after the German lender swung to a loss in the third quarter. Cie. Financiere Richemont SA jumped as the maker of Piaget jewelry unveiled a sweeping overhaul of top management and its board as it reported a plunge in sales. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index of equities fell for a fourth day, slipping 0.5%. Currencies The dollar fell for a sixth straight day, the longest stretch of losses since March, as traders kept their focus on the vote for the White House. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index lost 0.2%, erasing earlier gains. The greenback fell 0.3% to $1.1137 per euro and was little changed at ¥103.07. “It would be difficult for the market to move much given the elections on Tuesday,” said Andres Jaime, a foreign-exchange strategist in New York at Barclays Plc. The pound posted its best week since 2009 as a flurry of news offered relief for the currency. Sterling climbed on speculation a High Court ruling will delay or soften the terms of the nation’s exit from the European Union and it received a further boost when the Bank of England said it’s no longer expecting to cut interest rates again this year. Turkey’s lira led losses among 24 emerging-market peers. A court ordered the nation’s most prominent Kurdish lawmakers jailed, sharply escalating a crackdown personally led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and spurring fears of renewed violence and a possible rupture with the West. China’s yuan dropped to a record low against a trade-weighted currency basket amid speculation policy makers are using recent dollar weakness to boost the competitiveness of the nation’s exporters. Bonds Treasury two-year note yields fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 0.79%, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. Benchmark 10-year note yields declined four basis points to 1.78%. The employment report “was on target, but it wasn’t overly strong,” said Timothy High, US strategist at BNP Paribas SA in New York, one of 23 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “Given that it’s out of the way, the focus is more towards the uncertainty next week, the election clearly. The uncertainty will bring in some buying.” Global bond markets are coming off their worst month in two years amid investor concern that major central banks are preparing to gradually reduce unprecedented monetary stimulus. The Fed’s policy committee this week cited signs that inflation is accelerating as it said the case for higher borrowing costs had strengthened, even as it left its key rate target unchanged. Futures traders assigned about a 74% probability of tighter policy by December, up from a 69% chance seen a week ago. Commodities The Bloomberg Commodity Index fell 3.1% this week, the most since 8 July. Oil dropped 1.3% in New York, bringing the six-session decline to 11%. Prices closed on Thursday at the lowest level since Opec reached a preliminary accord in Algiers for the cuts, and extended losses Friday after Reuters reported that Saudi Arabia threatened to raise output if other members didn’t agree to cuts. Losses eased after Opec secretary-general Mohammed Barkindo said the kingdom didn’t make the threat. “We’re not seeing any path for an Opec agreement,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy. “There’s too much output growth in Opec outside of Saudi Arabia. It’s asking too much of Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies to make the cuts needed for this to work.” West Texas Intermediate for December delivery dropped 59 cents to settle at $44.07 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent for January settlement fell 77 cents, or 1.7%, to $45.58 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Gold held near a one-month high as it was caught in the crossfire between haven demand and prospects for higher US interest rates.

Dla S&P to już dziewiąta spadkowa sesja z rzędu. Dane z rynku pracy USA wzmocniły oczekiwania na podwyżkę stóp w grudniu. Rynek nerwowo obserwuje przebieg kampanii prezydenckiej w USA i najnowsze sondaże. Dow Jones Industrial na koniec dnia stracił 0,24 proc. i wyniósł 17.888,28 pkt. S&P 500 spadł o 0,17 proc. i wyniósł 2.085,18 pkt. Indeks ten spada już dziewiątą sesję z rzędu, co jest najdłuższą taką serią od prawie 36 lat. Nasdaq Comp. zniżkował o 0,24 proc. do 5.046,37 pkt. W centrum uwagi znalazł się w piątek najnowszy raport z amerykańskiego rynku pracy. Liczba miejsc pracy w sektorach pozarolniczych w Stanach Zjednoczonych w październiku wzrosła o 161 tys. wobec 191 tys. przed miesiącem po korekcie z 156 tys. Stopa bezrobocia w USA w październiku wyniosła 4,9 proc. Wzrost płacy godzinowej w ujęciu rocznym w październiku był najmocniejszy od czerwca 2009 r. Solidne dane z rynku pracy USA mogą utwierdzić rynek w przekonaniu o podwyżce stóp procentowych podczas grudniowego posiedzenia Rezerwy Federalnej. Prawdopodobieństwo podwyżki stóp w następnym miesiącu, wyceniane przez kontrakty na stopę Fed, wynosi 78 proc. Od pewnego czasu sytuację na rynku kształtuje nerwowe oczekiwanie inwestorów na wyniki wyborów prezydenckich w USA. Niepewność jest na tyle duża, że indeks S&P zakończył spadkami już dziewięć sesji z rzędu. Rynki uważnie śledzą sondaże przedwyborcze w USA. W piątkowym badaniu ABC News/Washington Post Clinton zgromadziła 47 proc. poparcia, a Trump 44 proc. Po okresie ciszy medialnej związanej z posiedzeniem Rezerwy Federalnej, jej członkowie ponownie rozpoczynają publiczne wystąpienia. W piątek Dennis Lockhart, prezes Fed z Atlanty, ocenił, iż październikowy raport z rynku pracy USA jest "satysfakcjonujący", a podwyżki stóp w USA w ciągu najbliższych dwóch lat będą "bardzo stopniowe". Z indeksu Dow Jones najlepiej zachowywały się akcje Home Depot. W dół indeks ciągnęły m.in. Procter and Gamble. Najlepiej radziły sobie spółki z sektora opieki zdrowotnej oraz przemysłowe. Na minusie znalazły się przedsiębiorstwa z sektora dóbr podstawowych. Do tej pory ok. 80 proc. firm notowanych na S&P 500 podało swoje wyniki kwartalne, z czego 75 proc. pozytywnie zaskoczyło zyskami, a 56 proc. sprzedażą. W czwartek po zakończeniu sesji raporty przedstawiły m.in. Kraft Heinz i Starbucks. Wyniki Kraft rozczarowały inwestorów, a spółka traciła w trakcie piątkowych notowań nawet 4 proc. W reakcji na wyniki kurs Starbucks zwyżkował blisko 3 proc. Ponad 7 proc. taniały walory Willis Watson. Ubezpieczyciel obniżył prognozę przychodów na 2016 r. Mimo rosnących szans na wzrost kosztu pieniądza w USA, od wtorku dolar osłabił się wobec euro o 1,5 proc., a od minimum z 25 X - już o 2,5 proc. Kurs EUR/USD znajduje się w okolicach 1,11. Po czwartkowym orzeczeniu Wysokiego Trybunału, sądu najwyższego Wielkiej Brytanii, w opinii rynku i komentatorów oddaliła się perspektywa "twardego Brexitu", co wpływa na umocnienie funta. Kurs GBP/USD rósł w piątek do ponad 1,25 i znajduje się już tylko 0,5 proc. poniżej notowań sprzed "flash-crashu" z 7 października. Najtańsza w historii jest turecka lira. W nocy turecka policja aresztowała przywódców prokurdyjskiej Ludowej Partii Demokratycznej (HDP), która jest trzecią siłą w tureckim parlamencie. Po południu sąd zdecydował o ich tymczasowym aresztowaniu. Kolejną spadkową sesję zaliczyła ropa naftowa, która do piątku wytraciła wszystko, co udało jej się zyskać po wrześniowym posiedzeniu krajów OPEC w Algierze. Agencje donoszą, że w ubiegłym tygodniu Arabia Saudyjska zagroziła, iż zwiększy wydobycie nawet do 12 mln baryłek dziennie, po tym jak Iran nie zgodził się na ograniczenie wydobycia poniżej 4 mln baryłek. Obecnie Saudowie pompują dziennie na powierzchnię 10,5-10,7 mln baryłek. Informacjom tym zaprzeczył jednak Mohammed Barkindo, sekretarz generalny OPEC. Baryłka Brent taniała nawet o 2 proc. do ok. 45,4 USD, a baryłka WTI kosztowała przez moment poniżej 44 USD. Od poniedziałku cena Brent spadła o ok. 10 proc., a to oznacza, że tydzień zakończy największą tygodniową stratą od 9 miesięcy. Europejskie indeksy już dziesiątą sesję z rzędu zakończyły na minusach. Niemiecki indeks DAX stracił na zamknięciu sesji 0,65 proc., francuski CAC 40 spadł o 0,78 proc., a brytyjski FTSE 100 zniżkował 1,43 proc. Nawet 7 proc. w dół zniżkował kurs Erste, a notowania Commerzbanku traciły ok. 1 proc., po publikacji kwartalnych wyników, które inwestorzy odczytali negatywnie. Walory Financiere Richemont, producenta biżuterii, zyskiwały ponad 5 proc., po ogłoszeniu zmian w kierownictwie spółki w odpowiedzi na słabe wyniki kwartalne. Bez większych zmian pozostał kurs BMW, który zaraportował wyższy niż rok wcześniej zysk. 2 proc. zyskiwał L'Oreal. Inwestorzy pozytywnie przyjęli wyższy od konsensusu wzrost sprzedaży producenta kosmetyków. Ponad 3 proc. taniały walory IAG, właściciela British Airways. Spółka obniżyła prognozę zysku na lata 2016-2020 do 5,3 mld euro z 5,6 mld euro. PODWYŻKI STÓP W USA BARDZO STOPNIOWE, PAYROLLE ZA X "SATYSFAKCJONUJĄCE" - LOCKART, FED Październikowy raport z rynku pracy USA jest "satysfakcjonujący" - ocenił w piątek Dennis Lockhart, prezes Fed z Atlanty. Jego zdaniem, podwyżki stóp procentowych w USA w ciągu najbliższych dwóch lat będą "bardzo stopniowe". Dodał, iż nie oczekuje, by stopy procentowe w USA wzrastały przez dłuższy czas "zaplanowanej z góry kampanii zacieśniania". Jego zdaniem, decyzje ws. kosztu pieniądza będą opierać się na twardych danych "z posiedzenia na posiedzenie". Lockhart ocenił, iż wzrost PKB w USA w 2016 r. wyniesie nieco poniżej 2 proc., a w IV kw. 2016 r. oraz w 2017 r. wyniesie ok. 2 proc. Lockhart powiedział również, iż obecnie nie widzi poważnych przesłanek recesji w USA. ZNACZNA REWIZJA W GÓRĘ PAYROLLI ZA IX, MOCNY WZROST PŁACY GODZINOWEJ Liczba miejsc pracy w sektorach pozarolniczych w Stanach Zjednoczonych w październiku wzrosła o 161 tys. wobec 191 tys. przed miesiącem po korekcie. Łączna korekta liczby nowych miejsc pracy za ostatnie dwa miesiące wynosiła +44 tys. Liczba miejsc pracy w amerykańskim sektorze prywatnym wzrosła o 142 tys., podczas gdy miesiąc wcześniej wzrosła o 188 tys. po korekcie. Analitycy ankietowani przez agencję Bloomberg spodziewali się stopy bezrobocia w USA na poziomie 4,9 proc. oraz że liczba miejsc pracy w sektorach pozarolniczych wzrośnie o 173 tys. wobec 156 tys. we wrześniu przed korektą, a w sektorze prywatnym wzrośnie o 170 tys. wobec wzrostu o 167 tys. miesiąc wcześniej przed korektą. Stopa bezrobocia w USA w październiku wyniosła 4,9 proc., wobec 5,0 proc. we wrześniu. Wynagrodzenia godzinowe wzrosły w październiku o 0,4 proc. mdm, po wzroście o 0,3 proc. miesiąc wcześniej po korekcie wobec 0,2 proc. przed korektą. W ujęciu rocznym wynagrodzenia godzinowe w październiku wzrosły o 2,8 proc., po wzroście o 2,7 proc. we wrześniu po korekcie, wobec 2,6 proc. przed korektą. Tu spodziewano się odczytów odpowiednio na poziomie: 0,3 proc. i 2,6 proc. S&P 500 STRACI 5 PROC. PO ZWYCIĘSTWIE TRUMPA - CITI Zwycięstwo Donalda Trumpa w wyborach prezydenckich spowoduje natychmiastowy spadek indeksu S&P 500 o ok. 3-5 proc. - ocenili w piątek analitycy Citi. W długim terminie, ich zdaniem, wygrana Trumpa wprowadza ryzyko niższego wzrostu gospodarczego lub recesji, jeżeli dojdzie do wprowadzenia ograniczeń w handlu oraz ograniczenia ekspansji fiskalnej. ZYSK I PRZYCHODY STARBUCKS ZGODNE Z OCZEKIWANIAMI Zysk Starbucks wyniósł w IV kwartale obecnego roku podatkowego 56 centów na akcję wobec szacowanych przez analityków 55 centów na akcję. Przychody firmy wzrosły w IV kw. (zakończył się 2 października 2016) o 16 procent do 5,71 miliarda dolarów - podał Starbucks. Analitycy spodziewali się zaś 5,69 miliarda dolarów. Firma podwyższyła kwartalną dywidendę do 25 centów na akcję z 20 centów. Sieć kawiarni nie sprostała jednak oczekiwaniom rynkowym, jeśli chodzi o globalną sprzedaż - w IV kwartale wzrosła ona o 4,0 proc., podczas gdy analitycy oczekiwali wzrostu o 4,8 proc. Starbucks prognozuje w roku podatkowym 2017 dwucyfrowy wzrost przychodów, a zysk na akcję - w przedziale 2,12-2,14 USD. Analitycy spodziewają się jednak po tej firmie lepszych danych - zysku na poziomie 2,16 USD na akcję. DOBRY WYNIK KRAFT HEINZ W III KW. Amerykański gigant spożywczy Kraft Heinz, z siedzibą w Pittsburgu, podał, że w III kwartale jego skorygowany zysk na akcję wzrósł rdr o 89 procent i wyniósł 83 centy wobec 44 centów na akcję w III kw. 2015. Wynik zaskoczył analityków, którzy spodziewali się kwartalnego zysku na poziomie 74 centów na akcję. Przychody za III kwartał jednak nieznacznie spadły - o 1,5 proc., z 6,36 miliarda dolarów do 6,27 mld USD, co jest nieco poniżej 6,3 mld dolarów szacowanych przez analityków. ZYSK ERSTE BEZ ZASKOCZEŃ, PROGNOZY CIĄGNĄ KURS W DÓŁ Zysk netto Erste Banku w III kw. wyniósł 337,4 mln euro, zgodnie z oczekiwaniami. W analogicznym okresie ubiegłego roku bank wypracował 277 mln euro zysku. Wynik odsetkowy banku wyniósł 1,07 mld euro wobec 1,11 mld euro oczekiwań. Jednocześnie bank poinformował o obniżce prognoz dla wysokości kluczowego wskaźnika rentowności do 10 proc. z 12 proc. KWARTALNA STRATA COMMERZBANK, PROGNOZY ZYSKU ZA CAŁY ROK Commerzbank zaraportował stratę netto za III kw. w wysokości 288 mln euro, wobec 235 mln euro zysku w analogicznym okresie ubiegłego roku. Oczekiwano tymczasem straty rzędu 475 mln euro. Bank poinformował, iż oczekuje dodatniego wyniku netto na koniec roku. Współczynnik Tier 1 banku wzrósł do 11,8 proc. z 11,5 proc. w ubiegłym kwartale. Bank oczekuje wzrostu współczynnika do 12 proc. na koniec 2016 r. Commerzbank przechodzi restrukturyzację, zamierzając zlikwidować co piąte miejsce pracy. WYNIKI L'OREAL POWYŻEJ OCZEKIWAŃ Sprzedaż porównywalna L'Oreal w III kw. wzrosła o 5,6 proc. rdr, o 1,1 pkt. proc. powyżej rynkowych oczekiwań. Za udany dla firmy kwartał odpowiada w szczególności wzrost sprzedaży o 7,5 proc. w Ameryce Północnej. Przychody L'Oreal wyniosły 6,15 mld euro, wobec 6,09 mld konsensusu.

The recently announced ­donation by Cynthia and Edward Maletis, who made a fortune in a Portland-based beverage distribution business, will go into an endowment that’s expected to spin off about $200,000 a year for the business dean to spend at her discretion on special projects. Such endowed deanships are coveted and can be an advantage for universities trying to hire top administrators. “Cyndy and Ed Maletis’ ­extraordinary gift will help the dean support the university’s priority of boosting our academic standing and impact — for that we are deeply grateful,” UO President Michael Schill said. The UO’s 10 deans are the heart of the academic enterprise. The president and provost set strategic ­direction, and the deans execute. There’s been almost complete turnover in the ranks of the UO’s deans in the past seven years. The extra money from an endowed deanship allows the holder to spend on favored projects — and in some cases receive salary stipends for themselves. Spinoff from the Maletis deanship can’t be used for salary. “An endowed deanship is the single most prestigious position in a school or college,” according to the UO policy on deanships, chairs and professorships. “The holder of an endowed deanship possesses the stature, ­experience and vision to position their school or college within the top programs of their kind in the world.” Endowed deans are required to use the names of the donor or donors wherever they go, ­including on letterhead, on business cards and in publications. They also must welcome donors for tours or other campus visits — and notify them of developments in the school or college they oversee. Sarah Nutter, the new business dean recruited from George Mason, will be the first to hold the Edward Maletis Deanship when she arrives on ­campus in January. She will be free to use the annual proceeds to develop a new degree or a new area of research — or to provide matching funds to reel in grants. “It’s about enhancing the program that exists within the school or college. It’s not providing any kind of salary supplement to the dean themselves,” said Paul Elstone, UO senior associated vice president for development. Nutter will have a base salary of $410,000, which is 11 percent higher than the previous dean, Kees de Kluyver. When the endowment is fully funded, she’ll have the $200,000 annual spin-off to spend on projects. The donation helped the UO secure Nutter, and it will help the college keep top-tier faculty, said Bruce Blonigen, who served as interim business dean as well as chairman of the dean search committee. Private funds boost pay Two of the university’s previous deanships provided a salary stipend — not to exceed 50 percent of the annual payout — for the dean as well as the extra money for programs. The Edwin L. Artzt Dean in the School of Journalism and Communication, created in 1999 to honor the alumnus and former Procter & Gamble Co. chief executive officer, has offered its holder an annual $20,000 ­administrative stipend. The Donald and Willie Tykeson Deanship, endowed by Eugene telecommunications magnate Don Tykeson, provides an annual $15,000 stipend to the head of the College of Arts and Sciences. Nike co-founder Phil Knight in 1996 gave $15 million as seed funds to establish more than two dozen endowed positions for faculty and administrators — including one that gave a $40,000 annual salary boost for UO then-President Dave Frohnmayer. The idea of a public university president getting pay from private interests was so controversial at that time that Frohnmayer placed half in an account to cover presidential expenses rather than pay, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education. Today, the university doesn’t routinely disclose how much of UO President Michael Schill’s $660,000 base salary is provided by private donations. Money flowing in to UO But the practice of boosting pay with ­private funds is spreading to lower echelons at public universities, including at the UO with the Philip H. Knight University Librarian and the Philip H. Knight Dean of the ­Oregon School of Law. The cost to donors of naming a UO dean is $5 million, and the university hopes to establish endowments for its remaining deanships, Elstone said. Maletis is a longtime donor to the UO who has plowed his gifts into the Ford Alumni Center, the School of Journalism and Communication and the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics. He is the former chairman of ­Columbia Distributing Co. of Portland, a top national wine, malt beverage and soda distributorship. Maletis was instrumental in pushing the Legislature to free the UO from state control. In 2012, he chipped in $65,000 along with Knight, former athletic director Pat Kilkenny, UO business center namesake and current UO Board of Trustees Chairman Charles Lillis, and some others, to form the political action committee “Oregonians for Higher Education Excellence.” The powerful alumni group told lawmakers that if the UO were freed, they would lift the university with contributions — and, in recent months, the money has flowed. In October, Knight pledged $500 million for a new research campus at the university. In July, ­Lillis gave $10 million for the study of volcanos. More University Of Oregon articles » University of Oregon dean pay The university uses salary, perks and other inducements — increasingly provided by donors — to attract administrators.

Published: 19:03 November 5, 2016 Bloomberg   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE New York: US stocks posted their longest slide since 1980, while Treasuries rallied after data showing progress in the American labour market did little to soothe anxiety over the presidential election. The S&P 500 index dropped for a ninth straight day, a gauge of equity volatility had the longest stretch of gains on record and Treasuries climbed the most since September ahead of this week’s vote. All the jitters sent the dollar down after a brief advance that followed data showing US jobs rose at a steady pace in October, supporting a Federal Reserve hike next month. Traders have piled into relatively safer assets as opinion polls showed the US presidential race tightening after Hillary Clinton seemed poised for victory. While American stocks have almost always risen in the days before a presidential election, anxiety about the outcome of the November 8 vote has weighed on the market this time, overshadowing key reports such as the jobs data. “The jobs number should increase rate-hike odds and push up the dollar further, but nothing is happening in the markets ahead of the election,” said Dennis Debusschere, a senior managing director and global portfolio strategist at Evercore ISI in New York. “All expectations of the rate outlook and by extension the markets are being muted by election uncertainty.” Republican nominee Donald Trump showed strength in Iowa and Ohio pre-Election Day voting, while Clinton’s advantage in early balloting looked favourable in North Carolina and Nevada, according to a Bloomberg Politics analysis. A report today showed payrolls climbed by 161,000 last month following a 191,000 gain in September that was larger than previously estimated. Wages rose from a year earlier by the most since 2009, and the jobless rate fell to 4.9 per cent. The figures are likely to keep the Fed on track to raise borrowing costs next month for the first time in 2016. The S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent to 2,085.18 at 4pm in New York, after erasing a 0.5 per cent advance. The gauge fell to as low as 2,083, its average price during the past 200 days, and a technical level it hasn’t breached since the rout that followed the UK’s June vote to leave the European Union. The CBOE Volatility index surged 73 per cent in nine days. “The US elections are the elephant in the room for markets at the moment,” said Christian Gatticker, Zurich-based head of research at Julius Baer Group Ltd. “The best case is gridlock where Hillary wins and works with a Republican Congress, while a worst case is a hung vote.” Equities faded in afternoon trading as declines among consumer, financial and energy shares overshadowed gains in drugmakers. Procter & Gamble Co. and Amazon.com Inc sank more than 1.5 per cent. Insurer Willis Towers Watson Plc tumbled after cutting its full-year revenue forecast, and Wells Fargo & Co. lost 1.6 per cent. Crude’s drop weighed on oil producers. The Stoxx Europe 600 index extended its weekly slide to 3.5 per cent, the biggest since February. Erste Group Bank AG sank after Austria’s biggest bank forecast lower profitability next year. Commerzbank AG slipped after the German lender swung to a loss in the third quarter. Cie. Financiere Richemont SA jumped as the maker of Piaget jewellery unveiled a sweeping overhaul of top management and its board as it reported a plunge in sales. The MSCI Emerging Markets index of equities fell for a fourth day, slipping 0.5 per cent.
