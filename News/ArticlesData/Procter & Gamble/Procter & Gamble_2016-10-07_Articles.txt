Bringing up baby — and hanging on to career Zara Kessler, Bloomberg 11:03 a.m. EDT October 8, 2016 The Mom Project matches women who want flexible work with employers who want them. (Photo: PROVIDED) Allison Robinson looks young for a mom, let alone a CEO. But, days from turning 30, she's both: the mother of a 14-month-old son and an even younger company, the Mom Project, which matches women who want flexible work with employers who want them. Robinson had been at Procter & Gamble since college, most recently working on the Pampers brand as a senior account executive for the North America baby care market and strategy team. While on maternity leave, she read about the many highly qualified mothers who leave their jobs. Returning to work after a leave can be difficult, and women's earning power can take a hit. "I felt like the decision of being a full-time career mom or a stay-at-home mom was too binary, and I wanted to create a solution in between, that allowed moms to stay professionally engaged through rewarding, challenging work to keep their skill sets current," said Robinson, who lives in Chicago with her husband, Gregory, a business operator at a private equity firm, and their son, Asher. Robinson never went back to P&G. In early April, she launched her "digital talent marketplace." The service, for which more than 6,500 people have signed up, is mainly for women but will help connect anyone with work ranging from project-based, its focus, to permanent. For employers, it can provide skilled female candidates eager to work in flexible roles. The Mom Project, free to job hunters, collects information on their backgrounds and aims and on companies' needs. In candidates, it looks for an undergraduate degree, at least, and five years of work, and verifies education and employment histories before someone gets an offer. Employers pay Robinson a service fee of 20 percent of what they pay their new hire. The business has signed up more than 150 employers, including Hyatt Hotels and Penn Mutual Life Insurance Co., and more than 50 have made a match or are close to making one. There are resources such as iRelaunch for women who want to return to work. Après has a job market, while the nonprofit Path Forward focuses on midcareer internships at companies for people following a caregiving stint. Robinson said she's looking to keep millennial women in the workforce, by letting them scale back when they have a baby. The brand new network currently has some older members. It took Kate Thomson, 37, to the marketing department at Penn Mutual, in Horsham, Pennsylvania. She's on-site Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. for an initial six months and has Penn Mutual's permission to maintain her clients in a consultancy she started in the summer of 2015. The setup allows her to get her five-year-old on the school bus for kindergarten and drop her two-year-old at preschool before work, then reverse the process on the way back. "So it's almost like they won't even know I'm gone," she said. "Which is sort of incredible." Before she began consulting, Thomson had spent 15 years in marketing and advertising, telecommuting the last several years but with a lot of travel. She came across the Mom Project on Facebook. "I want to wear clothes and talk to grownups," she said. "But I don't want to sacrifice my children's babyhoods for that, and I did that for a long time." Ten days into her new schedule, Thomson wrote by e-mail that things were going well. She was happy to be spending time with her kids, but "there's a special joy to be found in commuting BY MYSELF," she wrote, adding that "nobody is touching me or needing things." Still, untraditional work arrangements may not come with benefits, and years of project-based work could leave a woman ill-prepared to ratchet her salary back up for full-time work. And not every job pans out. Catherine Siris, 34, a millennial mother of two, had already left her career. The Hershey, Pennsylvania, resident has an MBA from George Washington University and completed Johnson & Johnson's human resources leadership development program. She hasn't been employed since she had her first child, who is 3. "I feel like I've lost a piece of my identity, because [career] was such a big part of my life," she said. The Mom Project submitted her as a candidate for a four-month, full-time, remote position in recruiting, which she thought would be a good test of whether she was ready to return to work full-time. Siris, who has also signed up for Après, recently learned from the Mom Project that the company is holding off on the role until early next year. Robinson doesn't have a monopoly on flexible work. The Second Shift helps find projects for experienced women; it takes a 5 percent cut when processing a member's payment from an employer and charges the employer 15 percent. MomSource Network charges users a one-time $50 fee and focuses on finding people flexible, long-term positions. FlexJobs, at $14.95 a month, with quarterly and yearly options, boasts tens of thousands of job listings. Prokanga offers a network of "vetted flexible talent" and charges that talent 20 percent of their payment. If Robinson's venture grows over time, it will be harder to maintain an intimate environment. Both Thomson and Siris had introductory calls after signing up. Now that isn't feasible, Robinson said, and the service is trying to engage women digitally. DELAWAREONLINE Study: DE Turf Sports Complex will boost Delaware economy And scale requires money. So far, Robinson and her husband have been financing the business themselves. The company is working toward closing a round of funding. Robinson took Thomson to a brick-and-mortar office. She may one day return Siris to work. Courtney Hyde, 40, found a job at the Mom Project itself. Hyde, who has a 3-year-old daughter, was working as an account executive for LinkedIn Talent Solutions when she saw a Facebook ad for the Mom Project. She signed up in March, before the official launch, looking for project-based or part-time work, wanting a sense of what was out there. Instead, she got a phone call from Robinson and, in June, joined the company full-time as vice president of sales, responsible for building and maintaining the base of its employer partners. A big company might want to support working parents, gain employment flexibility through peaks and valleys, or bring in an expert for a project without paying a consultant's fee, Hyde said. DELAWAREONLINE West Nile virus found at Dover Air Force Base prompts quick response Employers also come to the Mom Project, signing up on the digital platform. Interface, an Atlanta-based maker of modular flooring with a focus on sustainability, became a partner after Global HR Director Jillian Adams saw an article about it on LinkedIn and was drawn its similar focus on purpose. In the traditional staffing model, Adams said, you deal either with headhunters (or recruiting agencies) who find full-time professionals or with staffing agencies that fill temporary and permanent positions with less specialized workers. To find highly trained experts to work as consultants, it usually takes a formal consulting or specialized vendor, she noted. A mom Interface hired through the network will soon start a job in communications on a project basis. In the grand scheme of things, it isn't clear whether millennials or Gen X-ers or anybody will find it easier to navigate flexible work, keeping a baby toe in the workforce while caring for babies. On a smaller scale, there's Asher, who started walking several weeks ago, with both Mom and Dad in attendance. It was late afternoon, in their basement, where Robinson and her toddler hang out because it's carpeted. "I feel like I'm making sacrifices to make this model work," she said. "Being there was a taste of what I want to solve for."

New York - Fabrizio Freda, the CEO of Estee Lauder, could tell the fragrance industry was changing by watching the members of his own family. His grandfather picked a signature cologne and never changed it, Freda says. But the executive’s son hasn’t shown that kind of loyalty - a typical attitude for younger consumers. If they wear cologne or perfume, they switch between niche brands and opt for smaller bottles. “The new generation really looks at fragrances as a wardrobe but not anymore as a personal signature,” the 59-year-old said in an interview. Many millennials don’t want mass-market perfumes, and celebrity scents -- once a vibrant part of the industry -- have fallen into decline. But so-called artisanal fragrances are surging. Sales of the products, which sometimes come in offbeat varieties, rose 22 percent last year, according to the research firm NPD Group. That made them the fastest-growing fragrance segment. In short, millennials no longer want to smell like Justin Bieber or Britney Spears - they’d rather have the scent of a smoky fireplace or old lipstick. And they don’t want to wear the same perfume every day. Merger mania Merger deals also are reshaping the industry and intensifying competition. Revlon Inc. agreed to buy Elizabeth Arden Inc. this year, teaming up with a large maker of celebrity perfumes. And Coty Inc. is poised to become the world’s largest seller of fragrance when it completes its purchase of Procter & Gamble Co.’s 41 beauty brands this year. Premium scents have kept the industry growing despite a slump in mass-market perfumes and colognes. The $6.6 billion market for US artisanal products and other premium fragrances is projected to grow 18 percent by 2020, according to Euromonitor International. Mass-market fragrances, meanwhile, are forecast to drop 15 percent. Celebrity brands were once seen as key growth drivers for Elizabeth Arden and Coty. But sales in that category dropped 31 percent in 2015, according to the NPD. Coty Chairman Bart Becht said his company plans to refocus on top designer brands, such as Marc Jacobs and Gucci, while cutting out some other names. Elizabeth Arden, which gets three-quarters of its sales from scents, also could shift more toward premium names under Revlon. Estee Lauder, best known for cosmetics and face cream, has used on the artisanal trend to fuel growth. Its fragrance sales increased faster than any other segment besides makeup last year. And the scents are more profitable than some designer-label products because they don’t require the same advertising and promotion, Freda said. Promising Estee Lauder’s Frederic Malle, Le Labo and By Kilian scents might not be known to most consumers, but they are some of its most promising fragrance brands. It also sells scents under the more recognisable names of Tom Ford and Jo Malone, offered in such varieties as nutmeg, ginger, and wood sage and sea salt. “A lot of people won’t have heard of these brands, but that’s what makes them cool because it’s not the same fragrance that you smell on everybody walking down the street,” said Eleanor Dwyer, a beauty analyst at Euromonitor. “It’s a discovery that you made. You liked it, and you bought it - and you’re wearing it.” For the past five years, the top brands in the US have been dominated by European companies, Chanel and L’Oreal, according to Euromonitor data. But New York-based Estee Lauder has climbed the charts with its Jo Malone scents. The label jumped to the No. 9 spot last year, up from number 24 five years ago. Angela Lopez, who works in finance in New York and wore Chanel No. 5 in her college years, is an example of a millennial shopper looking for something different. “I used to wear what’s popular, but I don’t want smell like everyone else now,” said the 31-year-old. “There are some perfumes that you smell everywhere. I like to discover new names and buy from small boutiques. It’s more expensive, but it’s worth it.” Rollerball size That attitude has prompted the industry to adopt smaller sizes, such as rollerballs that come in at around 10 milliliters. That’s the fastest-growing form of packaging, with an increase of 50 percent or more last year, according to Euromonitor data. Most other sizes either dropped or grew less than 1 percent. Rollerball-size fragrances can cost less than half the normal price, making it easier for budget-conscious millennials to try out new scents, said Karen Grant, a beauty analyst at the NPD. That could then build a foundation for the future. “A younger consumer is able to discover, experiment, carry it with them,” Grant said. “Different formats provide access to even higher-end fragrances, so then they are ready to graduate into a full fragrance.” BLOOMBERG Hungry for more business news?

Skip to content Beet.TV Search for: Don’t Vacate The Top Of The Funnel, Nielsen’s Solomon Tells Marketers   By Robert Andrews on October 7, 2016October 7, 2016 @robertandrews Pretty much the whole of the advertising technology world these days seems to focus around targeting. The better the targeting, the better the results, many people believe. So when the world’s largest advertising spender pulls back from targeted ads on one of the world’s largest ad platforms, people take notice. That’s what Procter & Gamble did this summer, when its chief brand officer declared it would change its Facebook strategy: “We targeted too much, and we went too narrow. And now we’re looking at: What is the best way to get the most reach but also the right precision?” That is a pivot media measurement house Nielsen’s product leadership SVP Eric Solomon endorses. “The underlying notion is, targeting may be a great tactic to drive certain metrics,” Solomon tells Beet.TV, in this video interview. “But, when you’re a brand advertiser, you can’t forget the top of the funnel. “You need to have ad campaigns that are geared toward driving the metrics that matter to you as a brand. It is not all about finding that specific target audience that already knows about you.” P&G’s CEO said it would “get back to making consumers aware of its products and communicating their benefits”. Marketing theory holds that a typical “purchase funnel” begins with sparking the initial interest of consumer prospects before leading them through consideration to purchase.   This video is part of Beet.TV’s coverage of the IAB MIXX Conference, 2016, presented by The TradeDesk.

Terry Shropshire, Managing Editor and Web Editor Leave a comment 586 reads ATLANTA — If there was one person who encapsulated the essence and excitement for the very first Black Women’s Expo in Atlanta that founder Merry Reed wanted to bottle up and shake all over the Georgia World Convention Center, it was the renowned Sasha the Diva, the irrepressible and effervescent host for KISS 104.1 FM. “It’s going to be a great day, a great weekend, particularly with Keke Wyatt,” she exclaimed with unabashed exuberance for the multifaceted event that takes place from Oct. 7-9 at the GWCC. “Let everyone know how absolutely amazing it is. Thank you, Merry Reed, for believing in our dreams (of black women) and coming here and it’s just going to grow and become huge for Atlanta!” Sasha the Diva entertains the crown as Black Women’s Expo founder Merry Reed (center) laughs resoundingly. Merry Reed, the visionary for the nationally-respected Black Women’s Expo that annually draws in 15,000 to 20,000 to the Chicago convention center every year, brought along a superstar starting squad of sponsors and partners to bring the Black Women’s Expo in with the type of fanfare that it deserves. “This is our very first Black Women’s Expo and we are just very excited to be here. We’ve been in Chicago for the past 22 years. This is a great expo for African American women – and men – and the whole family comes to our show. There is so much to do and so much to experience for everyone,” Reed said. The Black Women’s Expo is coming strong a cadre of stars and dignitaries, including professor and inspirational speaker Dennis Kimbro, relationship expert Stacii Jae Johnson, actress Elise Neal, singing sensation Keke Wyatt, Kindred Spirits and fashion aficionado and coif connoisseur Derek J, one of the stars of “Real Housewives of Atlanta.” And it was apropos that the first-ever event in Atlanta that Reed and the Black Women’s Expo would align with the intercontinental conglomerate Proctor & Gamble and their “My Black is Beautiful” campaign. “I’ll tell you why we decided to join forces with the Black Women’s Expo,” said Grace James, brand manager for My Black is Beautiful. “Come over to our booth and you can get your hairstyles, t-shirts, goodie bags, whatever you like. We’re very excited to partner with Merry Reed. We want to partner with any local groups and national groups we feel are making a difference in the black community — #SheMatters. We are very excited to be the presenting sponsor for Black Women’s Expo.” The Black Women’s expo also partnered up with Walgreens, which is offering half-price tickets, as well as My Family Insurance and Black Lives Matter, who said they wanted to support the black-centric extravaganza. Also in the house is General Motors, who are displaying a fleet of brand new Chevrolets for the attendees to take out on ride-and-drives, including their Camaros and Malibus.

VA issues with med schools go beyond Cincinnati Anne Saker , asaker@enquirer.com 11:37 a.m. EDT October 7, 2016 Buy Photo The difficulties in the relationship between the Cincinnati VA, the UC College of Medicine and UC Health are not new around the country. (Photo: The Enquirer/Anne Saker)Buy Photo Over 70 years, a relationship inevitably develops issues: communication miscues, struggles over who’s in charge of the money or the work, debates about who’s taking advantage of whom. This year, the Department of Veterans Affairs marked the 70th anniversary of its official relationship with medical schools across the country. Army Gen. Omar Bradley forged the alliance in the aftermath of World War II: The VA had a flood of patients but not enough doctors; medical schools were producing doctors who needed to see patients as a way to gather clinical experience. Today, 65 percent of all U.S. physicians have gotten at least part of their training, arranged through their medical school, with the VA. VA and medical school officials praise the relationship as a win-win situation for everyone. In February, William Ball, dean of the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, came to a news conference at the Cincinnati VA Medical Center to say the medical school is “very proud” of its VA affiliation. But turbulence at the Cincinnati VA Medical Center this year indicates that fractures are putting major stress on the longstanding marriage between the VA and the 124 medical schools with which it is affiliated. Cincinnati’s situation, while unusual, is not unique. Investigations by the VA's inspector general and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) have revealed difficulties in the VA's relationship with medical schools and teaching hospitals, which often have different goals than the VA. The problems between the VA and the medical schools are turning up in numerous ways. For example: The VA appears to have lost control over its contracts with affiliated medical schools and medical practices to provide doctors to treat VA patients. In June, an oversight panel of the House Veterans Affairs Committee held a hearing to review a report from the GAO, the independent watchdog that investigates for Congress how the federal government spends taxpayer dollars. The report said the VA takes three years to develop a long-term contract with an affiliate. VA officials do not get enough training to negotiate contracts. Some VAs have stopped trying to write long-term contracts and now bounce along from one expensive short-term contract after another. The VA doesn't seem to know how to diagnose or treat its problems with medical schools. At the June hearing, members of Congress questioned Dr. Robert Jesse, head of the VA’s Office of Academic Affiliations about an August 2015 inspector general’s report that at the VA hospital in Pittsburgh, surgeons from the affiliated University of Pittsburgh Physicians had overbilled the VA. In one instance, the doctors’ group billed the VA for every hour in one entire month. When committee members challenged Jesse about getting that money back, Jesse responded that he wasn’t sure he had the authority to do so. The VA isn’t getting the credit or the financial benefits for research breakthroughs that doctors achieve on VA time with VA resources. Dr. Raymond Schinazi, for example, worked for the VA Medical Center in Atlanta and at Emory University. During his career, Schinazi developed a cure for the liver infection hepatitis C in a private laboratory he owned. In August 2015, he won an award from the VA for research. In January, he retired from the VA and sold the lab and the drug to a drug company in 2011 for $400 million. The VA got nothing. VA patients sometimes need to go out in the community to get care, typically at higher cost. In 2014, the VA spent $7 billion in “non-VA care” – a 160 percent increase in less than 10 years. Unlike Medicare and Medicaid, which contract with medical systems to deliver care, much of the non-VA care for veterans is authorized individually – an expensive method of care that VA officials acknowledge needs improvement. In Cincinnati, the VA spends about $40 million a year in non-VA care with UC Health. The Cincinnati VA’s issue strikes at the heart of the relationship between the VA and its affiliated medical partners. In Cincinnati, more than 30 doctors, nurses and other caregivers complained to VA Secretary Robert McDonald of Indian Hill, former chairman of Procter & Gamble, that VA hospital management was cutting corners to save money, causing “near misses” in patient care. When the complaints went public in February, the VA demoted the Cincinnati VA’s acting chief of staff to a data-entry job in the hospital basement while an inspector general’s review was launched into the complaints. In turn, the acting chief of staff, Dr. Barbara Temeck, a career VA doctor and administrator, accused officials of the UC College of Medicine and the nonprofit, UC Health, of steering patients away from the VA and of dominating how VA doctors practice medicine and conduct research -- often to the detriment of the Cincinnati VA. On Monday, a special VA administrative investigative board, separate from the inspector general’s review, arrived in Cincinnati to look into Temeck’s allegations about the UC-VA relationship. She was the first witness to speak with the board, which is expected to interview other Cincinnati VA officials. The board most likely will need several months to reach any conclusions. 10 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2dRweJg TOP VIDEOS Sam DuBose sister: 'This, to me, is murder' 1:30 Protests in Cincinnati after Ray Tensing mistrial 1:09 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Mistrial declared in Ray Tensing case 3:46 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 Cincinnati Police Criminalist: Tensing 'seemed nervous or afraid' 2:59 Crime lab: No evidence on Tensing’s boots that he was dragged 4:07 Alternate juror in Ray Tensing trial has been dismissed 1:24 Lakota East's Horter wins state cross country 2:58 Born in Cincinnati, celebrated around the world: An anthem that unites us 3:39 Division I volleyball regional semifinals 1:46 More Stories Who the heck is Marilyn Z?

Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Oct 7, 2016 at 9:34AM Image source: Motley Fool. Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) doesn't sound like the most exciting growth stock around. After all, the company makes most of its sales and profits by selling mundane products such as toothpaste, soap, and pet food. Nevertheless, slow and steady sometimes wins the race: Colgate-Palmolive has produced impressive returns for investors over the years, and it still has a lot to offer going forward. A global market leader Colgate-Palmolive operates in multiple consumer staples segments, such as shampoo, shower gels, deodorants, and pet food, among several others. However, the lion's share of the business comes from oral care, where Colgate-Palmolive is an undisputed leader on a global scale. According to management, the company owns 43.9% of the toothpaste market around the world, with a special focus on emerging markets: Colgate-Palmolive has a market share of 73.3% in the Brazilian toothpaste market, 79.9% in Mexico, and it owns 53.4% of the market in India.  Image source: Colgate-Palmolive. The company is a pioneer when it comes to international expansion. Colgate-Palmolive entered Mexico in 1925, Brazil in 1927, and India in 1937. This first-mover advantage has been enormously beneficial for shareholders; Colgate-Palmolive now has a presence in 223 countries, with more than 75% of sales coming from international markets and over 50% of revenue produced in emerging markets. Image source: Colgate-Palmolive. The company has built long-standing relationships with dental care professionals around the world -- Colgate is recommended by 47% of dentists worldwide. This is a major advantage when it comes to brand recognition. Besides, specialized toothpaste generally carries premium prices and above-average profit margins, so Colgate-Palmolive's relationship with dentists has positive implications in terms of profitability, too. Translating competitive strength into profitability Solid competitive strengths are the key to sustained profitability over the long term. In addition to brand differentiation, Colgate-Palmolive enjoys cost advantages due to its massive scale and wide geographical reach. Besides, the company has abundant financial resources to invest in key areas such as marketing and advertising or research and development, which sets it apart from smaller competitors trying to steal market share away.  The company is facing economic headwinds in many of the main emerging markets where it operates, but financial performance remains solid as of the second quarter of 2016. Colgate-Palmolive reported a 5.4% increase in organic sales during the period, while adjusted gross profit margin grew 190 basis points year over year, to 60.2% of revenue. Management is doing a sound job at generating increasing profitability for investors, as gross profit margin is consistently moving in the right direction over the last couple of decades.  Image source: Colgate-Palmolive. On the back of solid competitive strength and attractive financial performance, the stock has downright crushed the market over time. Over the 20-year period ended in 2015, Colgate-Palmolive has delivered an accumulated total return, meaning dividends plus capital appreciation, of 1,021%, considerably beating both the S&P 500 index and the return offered by companies in its peer group. Image source: Colgate-Palmolive. Positioned for dividend growth High-quality companies in the consumer staples sector typically generate big and consistent cash flows, so they tend to pay generous dividends. In fact, dividends are one of the main reasons why many investors gravitate toward market leaders in different consumer staples categories.  Colgate-Palmolive pays a dividend yield of 2.3% at current prices, which is not particularly high by industry standards. For example, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is paying almost 3% in dividends, while Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) offers a dividend yield of 2.9%. On the other hand, the company has a pristine track record of dividend payments over the long term. Colgate-Palmolive has paid uninterrupted dividends for 122 years in a row, and it has increased dividends in every year over the last 54 consecutive years. Even better, Colgate-Palmolive has outperformed both Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark in terms of dividend growth over the last decade. CL Dividend data by YCharts. Wall Street analysts are on average expecting Colgate-Palmolive to make $2.87 in earnings per share during 2016. This puts the dividend payout ratio at nearly 54% versus earnings forecasts for the current year, which is quite a sustainable ratio. As a reference, Procter & Gamble has a dividend payout ratio of 68% of earnings, while Kimberly-Clark offers a dividend payout ratio around 61% versus earnings expectations for 2016. While Colgate-Palmolive is not the highest-yielding dividend stock in the consumer staples sector, the company doesn't leave much to be desired in terms of dividend growth. Financial performance has been remarkably solid over the long term, and the dividend payout ratio is still comfortably safe.

Published on October 07, 2016. Reprints Reprints Most Popular Organizations are spending countless hours and dollars to transform into digitally-deep, Snapchat-savvy marketers. In lieu of a better plan, many have relied on hiring digital natives -- or at least the "digitally immersed" among us -- to teach everyone else how this new-fangled stuff actually works. These employees spend their days servicing client needs, and their nights creating training programs intended to help their colleagues grasp the difference between DSPs, SSPs, DMPs and a host of other acronyms. (Ad Age just published some useful definitions here, actually.) The last decade has been dominated by remedial classes for traditionally trained advertising practitioners who grew up before the digital era. The problem is, there hasn't been adequate attention paid to the reverse. While agencies focused on educating offline experts about digital, they overlooked the fact that many digital natives have a limited knowledge of marketing overall. Many digital companies are a refreshing mix of former science students, Bachelor of Arts majors and business graduates. What they typically lack are employees with marketing degrees. This was less problematic when digital tactics consumed one's day, but as these people rise in the ranks and begin managing cross-disciplinary teams or seek roles as strategists or researchers, their lack of marketing savvy becomes apparent all too quickly. True, they may have completed countless channel-specific courses run by Google and Facebook, but because their careers to date have focused on the executional end of campaigns and budgets handed down after investment justifications have already been made, there has been little need for them to acquire a wider view. Even those in client-facing roles have traditionally needed one simple argument to drive success: The internet is big, people use the internet, your competitors use the internet to advertise, and you should too. That theory -- slapped across a few PowerPoint slides and backed up with appropriate statistics -- has driven growth in digital platforms, from desktop to mobile to search, and is still being used for new innovations like virtual reality. But digital isn't simply "digital" any more; it's just the way we live, love and conduct business. In the marketing arena, new technologies such as programmatic have also compressed the distance between executional and strategic. In 2016, every employee, whatever his or her job title, needs to add an understanding of the core marketing principles to their channel skills. You need a plan Agencies need to stop focusing on digital "up-skilling" and start thinking about connected training that covers all media channels and marketing principles -- for all their staff. Google has recognized this need by expanding its Squared Online digital marketing course to include modules such as "A Connected World" and "Think Like A Brand." The Institute of Direct and Digital Marketing also goes far beyond tactics with its Professional Diploma in Digital Marketing. AOL's Grow program is another inspiring initiative. It covers topics from the art of the pitch to leadership to agency-client relationships, and is backed up by experienced mentorship from ad industry legends like leadership veteran David Bell and ex-P&G CMO Jim Stengel. Although not specifically aimed at digital experts, its targeted audience of mid-senior agency management ensures that it's providing wider learnings to many rising stars who grew up in these channels. At MediaCom, we are building a global marketing curriculum that ensures that all our staff, whatever their level, have a broad understanding of marketing principles, along with those that may specifically apply to their individual disciplines. An essential part of the process for our industry is to encourage people to own up to the fact that, despite years of digital success, they may have no formal marketing training, and vice versa. The truth is that we all recognize we can't know it all. But an organization has to make it safe and comfortable for a high-flyer to admit that she or he has not been adequately trained in non-endemic skills. We can still celebrate their executional expertise. The ability to execute auction-based media, A/B testing, optimize creative formats at scale, as well as understand technology stacks and harness them for personalized marketing are all critical for our business. But we can also make it a positive when people add a new, broader perspective to this knowledge -- assets that will help them grow, develop and, ultimately, take on larger responsibilities. Our industry has come a long way when it comes to digital, and has rightly focused on training traditional marketers to confidently toss a "SERP," "interstitial," or "container tag" into their day-to-day conversations. Now we need our digital employees to have the best possible understanding of key concepts and principles too.

In a filing Thursday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Armstrong Flooring said COO David Schulz's position with the company will be eliminated, effective Oct. 15. "The Chief Operating Officer role had responsibility for providing transition guidance during our first year as a publicly traded company and would be reevaluated at the end of that one year," Alison van Harskamp, a company spokeswoman, said in a statement. "We've been able to achieve certain transition milestones more quickly than anticipated and determined it was prudent to eliminate the position at this time." The company's severance agreement with Schulz, according to separate SEC filings, said he will receive $1.26 million in a cash payment. Armstrong Flooring also will pay him a pro-rated annual incentive bonus to be paid at a later date, the new filing shows. Schulz was senior vice president and CFO at Armstrong World prior to the April 1 spinoff. He started with the company in 2011 after leaving Procter & Gamble.  Armstrong Flooring has about 3,500 employees worldwide and 17 manufacturing facilities in three countries. Shares of the company's stock are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol AFI.  More From This Industry • 'Fixer Upper' star visits York Wallcoverings to discuss product lines • How will Trump's trade, tariff policies affect manufacturing? • What should be the first priority for President-elect Donald Trump?

There are a number of ways where what we’re doing today is setting the stage for that soon-to-be-future. Most of the foundational elements of advertising today are setting the stage for a digital, addressable, television landscape. At the core are data and cross-device methodologies.   Much of the online landscape is still, rather surprisingly, based on third-party and first-party cookies. Mobile has some capacity for cookies, but is mostly based on device IDs. The TV landscape will be dependent on device IDs since cookies don’t work on set-top boxes, cable boxes, or TVs themselves. The methods for cross-device are applicable in this environment and will be a necessity for identifying and recognising customers and what stage of the journey they may be in when they’re exposed to an ad in that environment. Identifying and recognising the customer and delivering a personalised message across online, mobile, TV and even digital OOH and in-store will create a truly addressable, customisable media experience. Ad serving is also going to be challenged and refined in an addressable TV world. The commercial format is still the basis for advertising on a TV, and local boxes will need to be the launching point for addressable commercials. The local box or platform will need to identify, recognise and determine which commercial to serve up rather than calling from a remote location and serving it up over the Web. I foresee a technology where IDs are anticipated and commercials are served in the background, to be cached locally and called up at viewing. That means the local box can have a slew of commercials at the ready, and they can be delivered faster. Being able to view the entire digital media landscape in one interconnected campaign is going to be powerful for marketers. Identifying and recognising the customer and delivering a personalised message across online, mobile, TV and even digital OOH and in-store will create a truly addressable, customisable media experience. This makes attribution and measurement more accurate and provides marketers with the tools to optimise campaigns in a more efficient manner.   When this happens, the question remains: What happens to the upfront? I think the model of upfront buying will still be important, but at a corporate portfolio level where larger conglomerates are able to purchase media in advance and optimise allocations based on the portfolio of products they represent. From Viacom and Time Warner to Clorox and P&G, this creates a new way to manage media that drives efficiency even further than in the past. When one product is not making good use of the media, another can be slotted in to take its place and maximise the upfront allocation. I for one am truly excited about the combined digital landscape, which I predict will be the case in just four short years.  Today the numbers I’ve seen are that between 15 million to 17 million U.S. households will be digital-TV-enabled by the end of 2016. I assume progress to speed up over the next three years, delivering the kind of experience I, as a marketer, am truly looking forward to. Are you?
