Looks Good Long-Term Even though slow sales have weighed the company down in recent quarters, P&G's stock history of impressive dividend yield growth and overall returns could make this a prime long-term portfolio pick. Seth McNew (TMFMcNew) Nov 4, 2016 at 3:41PM Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), the conglomerate that owns some of the world's most recognizable consumer products brands, such as Charmin, Tide, and Pampers, has a undergone some major changes in the past few years. Even though this company has faced stagnating sales in recent quarters, its historical dividend yield, decision to split off many of its non-performing brands to focus on long-term profitability, and relative market strength make this company look like a solid long-term play. Because it's such a large, established business, investors shouldn't expect massive gains in revenue or earnings in the short term, but here are a few charts to show the impressive long-term history of this company.  Image source: Procter & Gamble. Sales fall but could be set for long-term growth P&G's sales appear to be in decline, going from over $80 billion in 2013 to just $65 billion in the most recent year. However, this drop in sales is not just because P&G is losing ground in the products it sells; it's because P&G has sold off more than half of its brands. In 2014, P&G implemented a new strategy to drive growth by divesting those sub-brands that weren't helping the company grow earnings. As a result, around 100 brands have been sold off in the past two years, with 65 core brands now making up all of P&G's sales and earnings.  PG Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts Sales for fiscal 2016, which ended June 30, dropped from to $65 billion from $70 billion a year ago, but the proceeds of those brand sales led to a net income boost of 50% year over year. P&G management has said it plans for another $10 billion in cost cuts over the next five years as it focuses more on the highest-performing segments, which should help drive even more earnings growth in years to come. P&G's expanding dividend P&G's dividend has remained a strong part of this company's overall investment appeal, and its historical moves in steadily increasing its payout should give investors confidence. P&G has raised its payout consistently in each of the past 60 years. The company's most recent boost in April moved its dividend to $2.68 annually, which makes for a 3.1% yield at the current share price.  PG Dividend data by YCharts Stock price history Even though sales have fallen amid the company's turnaround strategy and the company's organic growth has been pressured by the strong dollar, its stock price has risen steadily. As seen in the following chart, even during times of broad market sell-offs, such as in 2000 or the recession of 2008, P&G has remained a pretty consistent stock, since many of P&G's products are non-cyclical, such as diapers and soap. PG data by YCharts That chart takes into account P&G's various stock splits in its long history. The company has done a 2-for-1 split five times since going public, most recently in 2004, and it's possible that it could do so again soon.  P&G has been around for more than 100 years, and its history of rewarding shareholders who stick with the company over the long term shows no signs of stopping. There's very little chance that P&G will ever be a high-growth company again, or one that's very sexy in the products it offers or the headlines it makes. For investors more concerned with steady growth for the long term instead of an exciting company, P&G's history shows that it could be a great buy going forward.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Nov 4, 2016 at 12:36PM It's early yet for Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) shareholders to break out the champagne. Sure, the company just posted its fastest sales growth pace in years. And yes, profits spiked by double-digits as cost cuts flowed directly down to the bottom line. However, P&G left its weak fiscal year guidance unchanged (projecting 2% organic growth compared to 4% for rival Unilever (NYSE: UL)), and executives warned investors to expect bumpy results ahead. "We still have work remaining to get our brands back to market levels of growth," management said. One of the biggest challenges is in the baby care division, which was the consumer goods giant's worst-performing business segment last quarter: Segment Organic Volume Organic Sales Beauty 2% 3% Grooming 3% 3% Health care 5% 7% Fabric and home care 4% 4% Baby, feminine, and family care 4% 2% Data source: Procter & Gamble. The division is home to Pampers, the leading global diaper franchise and P&G's biggest single brand by far. The company managed solid volume growth, but baby, feminine, and family care was the only segment that suffered from lower average prices. At 2%, it also brought down the company's overall organic sales growth pace. Most of that weakness was in the baby portion, where P&G lost market share in the diaper category. What happened this quarter Parts of the portfolio did well. Pampers, for one, grew at a faster pace than the overall market with help from innovations in the Cruisers product line. Things weren't as encouraging on the value end of the market, though. The Luvs diapers brand lost share in North America and P&G was forced to lower prices in Europe due to rising competition from rivals including Kimberly-Clark's (NYSE:KMB) Huggies. P&G saw hefty declines while Kimberly-Clark's Huggies volume only fell slightly. Regionally, baby care stumbled in China but Procter & Gamble managed growth in other emerging markets. The baby, feminine, and family care division lost half of a percentage point of market share last quarter compared to a flat result for fiscal 2016. Struggles in the baby care segment might help explain why P&G kept its 2% growth forecast in place despite logging 3% improved sales in the fiscal first quarter. The company also warned that expenses will creep up as it spends heavily on marketing to support its brands.  Image source: P&G investor presentation. Overall organic growth, meanwhile, should match or slightly exceed the volume figure, which will imply that P&G passed along slightly higher prices to customers and didn't need to resort to aggressive promotions to protect market share. More work to do P&G's hefty advertising budget will be critical in any turnaround plan, as will its trial program, which is the strongest in the industry (it works with hospitals to get Pampers samples to over 70% of new moms in the U.S. every year). The good news for investors is that management is working hard to address the issue. "One business where we need to make much more progress is on baby care," Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller told investors in a recent conference call as he revealed that sales shrank by double-digits. A rebound is "not something that will happen overnight," Moeller warned, but will likely be driven by a string of innovative product launches like its recent premium taped diapers release. That's why organic growth will be key for investors to watch over the next few quarters. Ideally, volume will improve at a pace that's at least even with P&G's other divisions. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Courts no place for politics Aftab Pureval 4:13 p.m. EDT November 4, 2016 Aftab Pureval, candidate for Hamilton County Clerk of Courts. (Photo: Provided) Aftab Pureval is the Democratic candidate for Hamilton County clerk of courts and an attorney at Procter & Gamble. As your next clerk of courts in Hamilton County, I intend to create a more accessible, modern, and efficient court system.  And unlike our current clerk, I intend to take the politics out of our courts. Multiple news organizations have reported that Tracy Winkler has arm-twisted public employees to work on her political campaign. CityBeat reported that one of her employees felt “bullied” and “stressed” and concluded, “You wonder what might happen if you don’t contribute to the Winkler campaign.”  And no wonder. Cincinnati Magazine reported that more than 85 of her employees have contributed to her campaign. It was also reported that a top aide to Winkler sent threatening e-mail during work hours to county employees and was recently reprimanded by the county for his inappropriate behavior. And how did Tracy Winkler deal with this employee? According to the Enquirer, she created a new, taxpayer-funded position that pays $70,000. She rewarded him for his political loyalty. Let’s call this what it is – a made-up job created to cover-up the political activities in the clerk’s office. An Enquirer editorial said pointedly that Winkler’s behavior was “concerning” and gave her an editorial thumbs down. We should be concerned about this kind of old-school machine politics. It’s an abuse of the public trust and an abuse of your tax dollars. As your clerk of courts, I will take the politics out of our courts. Under my leadership, no employee will contribute to my campaign – or be intimidated into volunteering for party politics. I will hire the best, most talented public servants, and empower them to do their jobs. Instead of spending $70,000 to create a position for a political crony, we should be using taxpayer resources to focus on improving services, modernizing the office, and increasing access to justice. In recent weeks, I’ve outlined ideas to do just that. First, Hamilton County should create a Legal Self-Help Clinic that would enable people to navigate the court process and solve common legal issues. This idea came from the Access to Justice summit convened by the Republican Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio and the American Bar Association. Access to justice will be my highest priority as your clerk of courts and a Legal Self-Help Clinic will be an important step forward to providing access for everyone. Second, every citizen, not just the privileged few, should be able to access court records online. Currently, online access is limited to lawyers, journalists and law enforcement. These are public records available to all who visit the county courthouse. If they are public at the courthouse, they should available to every citizen. While other counties, including Franklin County and Cuyahoga County, even tiny Preble County, have figured out how to provide online access while also keeping our records safe, Hamilton County is once again behind the times, failing to provide the modern leadership that other counties provide. No surprise, Tracy Winkler, opposes both of these ideas. Ms. Winkler has been in politics a long time. A very long time. And like many politicians who have been in office a long time, they become protectors of the status quo, creatures of the bureaucracy, and proponents of “can’t do” public policy. That kind of politics does not serve the public well. I intend to be a proponent of “can do” public policy. I intend to be an innovator who champions efficiency, technology and open records. I intend not just to “manage” but to lead. I intend to make the system work for the people – all the people – not just those with money or special privilege. The purpose of our courts is to be the great leveler – the one place where everyone is equal. As your clerk of courts, I will ensure that access to justice is available to all of us, not just some of us.

Travis Hoium (TMFFlushDraw) Nov 4, 2016 at 10:20AM There are a handful of stocks on the market that have been paying a dividend for over 100 years. Procter & Gamble, ExxonMobil, and General Mills are three such names, and one thing they hold in common is that they run very stable and (arguably) boring businesses. They're also not involved in the volatile tech industry, where some of the world's biggest companies are today, but where businesses can also go from household name to obscurity in just a few years (see BlackBerry). Nor do they sell volatile consumer discretionary goods that can swing in and out of favor.  As we look forward to the next century, investors looking for low-risk dividends that can last another 100 years should be on the lookout for businesses that won't be easily disrupted by new technology or changing lifestyles. Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP), Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW), and American Water (NYSE:AWK) are four stocks that I think will be great dividend investments built for the next century.  Image source: Getty Images. Colgate-Palmolive What could be more consistent and predictable than hygiene and cleanliness? It's a consumer staple, and Colgate-Palmolive has a large market share that it can protect by simply having more shelf space than competitors at retailers. It's not impossible to conceive that the process of personal hygiene could change dramatically in the next century, but for the foreseeable future, toothpaste, soap, and other cleaning products doesn't look as if they will be disrupted, and that near certainty will provide predictable returns for investors.  The following chart shows the company's slow but steady, growth since the early 1980s, ending with the 2.2% dividend yield the stock has today. Long-term investors should love the steady trends higher. CL Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Colgate-Palmolive may not be an exciting business, but that's kind of the point when it comes to looking for low-risk dividends.  PepsiCo The soda business isn't as strong as it once was, as health has become more of a focus for consumers, but PepsiCo is a dominant player in beverages and snacks no matter what happens in soda. It owns Frito-Lay in snacks and is moving into less sugary drinks, including Aquafina, Lipton, and Izze.  People aren't going to stop eating, and as long as PepsiCo has the products, distribution, and shelf space in grocery stores and among retailers, the company will offer a reliable dividend. And those competitive advantages aren't easy to disrupt.  The 2.8% dividend yield for PepsiCo isn't the biggest on the market, but given the company's durable competitive advantage in a food business that isn't going away, this is a dividend investors should take a hard look at.  Sherwin-Williams Technology may be changing the way we work and communicate, but the paint business hasn't changed much in decades. Sherwin-Williams is a big player in U.S. paint, but it's still a relatively small player in the fragmented global coatings market. PPG (owner of Glidden) and Akzo Nobel, which focuses on industrial applications, are both larger than Sherwin-Williams for now, but the proposed acquisition of Valspar (NYSE:VAL) will help Sherwin-Williams gain market share and pricing power in the architectural paint segment around the world. The combined companies will be close to holding the No. 2 market share position worldwide.  SHW Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts Sherwin-Williams' dividend yield of 1.4% isn't the highest on this list, but it's probably one of the safest. Unless people stop painting homes and industrial structures stop needing paint for protection, the company will be making money for many decades to come.  American Water Works Once safe, electric utilities are coming under pressure from new consumer choices, such as buying solar panels and energy storage devices for their homes. That's a big reason I left electric utilities off this list. But water and wastewater utilities are facing no such pressure. For the foreseeable future, water will continue to come out of faucets tied to central water lines and waste will continue to flow to public sewers with little risk of disruption. And that's great news for American Water Works.  American Water runs a business providing water and wastewater services in regulated markets to 15 million people in 47 states and Ontario. The regulated nature of the business gives investors a predictable source of net income and cash flows. And management is targeting 7%-10% annual earnings-per-share growth from now until 2020.  Like a lot of the businesses I've discussed here, a water utility isn't terribly exciting for investors. But the 2.1% dividend yield the stock pays is coming from highly predictable cash flows in a regulated market that's still highly fragmented. Those are great features for investors looking for a dividend that will last another century, and that's why this little-known company made this list. Travis Hoium owns shares of Procter and Gamble.

Jamal Carnette (TMFJCar) Nov 4, 2016 at 9:32AM The worst-kept secret in financial media is that most companies want a strong dollar. Image source: Getty Images. "King Dollar" is a lie. The term, which is taken to mean that the government should attempt to keep the dollar's value high versus foreign currencies, is bandied about financial media as the cure of all economic ills. In truth, there are many economic pitfalls of a strong dollar. In the labor markets, a strong dollar encourages employers to cut domestic inputs (read: jobs) in favor of offshore production. Additionally, a stronger dollar makes it harder for U.S.-based multinationals to sell their products abroad and to convert profits back to U.S. dollars. King Dollar appears to be another economic "zombie idea" that was once accurate but has outlived its usefulness. During the '60s and '70s, when U.S.-based companies were importing inputs (especially oil) but not selling as much product abroad, a strong dollar would be of obvious benefit. Wall Street talking heads tend to skew older, and it appears many have not updated their outlook on business to account for the new economy, where oil costs have been mitigated by domestic energy production and the rise of American multinational corporations. One such multinational company, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), is caught in the crosshairs of a strengthening U.S. dollar. In an interview with CNBC, P&G CEO David Taylor noted that the company lost approximately $1 billion in pre-tax earnings because of negative currency effects in each of the past four years. If the Federal Reserve, led by Janet Yellen, decides to rapidly "normalize" interest rates (whatever that means), it could be the biggest short-term risk Procter & Gamble faces. Raising rates strengthens the dollar ... and hurts P&G It is widely expected that the Federal Reserve will raise rates at its December meeting, with a Wall Street Journal (subscription required) survey of economists finding that 81.4% felt the Fed would raise rates then. If the Fed goes through with the increase, money would flow into the United States to take advantage of higher rates, all other factors equal, which would increase the relative value of the dollar versus other currencies. For example, last year P&G noted that 23% of all sales were in Europe. In the past six months, the two largest currencies in the euro region, the British pound and the euro, have depreciated versus the dollar: Data source: US Forex.com. Rates quoted in USD per European currency. The chart shows the dollar exchange rate over the past six months for the euro and the British pound as a direct quote. Simply put, this is the amount of dollars it would take to equal one unit of euro and pound. As such, a decrease in the line on the chart signifies a strengthening of the dollar, which hurts P&G. While the euro has been mostly stable during the past six months, the pound has been, well, pounded, as concerns about Brexit have weighed on the currency. An increase in interest rates will exacerbate the dollar's strengthening versus these currencies. Even worse, a premature rush to "normalization" while other central banks continue to keep interest rates low could be the biggest risk to P&G and its stable of price-sensitive, commodity-like products in the short term. My suspicion is the "King Dollar" crowd is less concerned with the exchange rate and more interested in the rate increase. The biggest beneficiary of an increase in interest rates is not necessarily individual savers, who have mostly already chosen higher-yielding investments, but rather Wall Street banks that would immediately benefit from the net interest spread. This is especially true if they don't pass along the increased rates to their depositors, as they did the last time the Federal Reserve raised rates. To date, Yellen's Fed hasn't given in to incessant demands from financial media to rapidly "normalize" rates; P&G should hope that situation continues.   Jamal Carnette has no position in any stocks mentioned.

JARRAD HEDES/TIMES NEWS ‹ Prev 1 of 2 Next › Compressor site for pipeline project to go before Kidder board By Jarrad Hedes jmhedes@tnonline.com UGI Energy Services officials recently touted its proactive safety measures during a tour of its compressor station in Wyoming County, the same type of facility planned for Kidder Township to serve the PennEast natural gas pipeline project. The proposed 48,000-horsepower compressor station, planned near Interstate 80 and Route 940, is scheduled to come before the Kidder Township Zoning Hearing Board on Monday. One of the member companies making up the PennEast Pipeline Company, UGI said one of its most comparable stations was built in two phases starting in 2013 in Meshoppen. “Our line here can go to homeowners, industrial facilities or businesses,” said John Stahl, superintendent of gas compression at the UGI facility. “Where the demand is, that’s where the gas goes. We supply Proctor and Gamble here in Wyoming County, and residential homes within a 10-mile stretch of our station.” Gas, which is compressed from Marcellus Shale, is given to UGI from certain contracted producers. Before it gets to the station, it is dehydrated. “We have to make sure the gas is clean so we can scrub it,” Stahl said. “After it comes out of the ground, it’s naturally wet, so we have to make sure it’s dry. We use moisture and sulfur analyzers to do the testing.” Ensuring the quality of the gas is important for UGI’s customers, but Stahl said the company also has a state-of-the-art supervisory control and data acquisition system to make sure operators know what is happening inside the station at all times. UGI’s 26 gas and 14 fire detectors help it diagnose trouble before it happens. “The infrared technology could spot the heat before there would be flames,” Stahl said. “We detect gas at 20 percent LEL (lower explosive limit) and shut the station down at 40 percent. The standard is 25 and 50 percent, but we want to make sure we never even get to that point.” During normal operations, however, Stahl said the plant runs no higher then 1 or 2 percent. Anything higher would likely indicate a leak. The 118-mile PennEast pipeline would cut through Kidder, Penn Forest, Towamensing and Lower Towamensing townships in Carbon County. Safety of the compressor station has been a main concern of opponents of the pipeline. At a recent Kidder Township supervisors meeting, Linda Christman, of the opposition group Save Carbon County, said compressor stations are more likely than pipelines to be involved in explosions. Stahl said his crew have regular hazard analysis meetings. “We go over all of the weird scenarios,” he said. What happens if this fails and then that fails and then that fails. We need to be prepared for everything. The safety of the public, our employees and our equipment has to be our top priority.” On the day of the tour, UGI moved 100 million cubic feet of gas through the station. Two of its eight compressors were running. Outside the building, noise levels run at about 55 decibels at 100 feet away from the building. “It’s louder in a normal kindergarten classroom,” said Pat Kornick, PennEast spokeswoman. “We’re able to stand here and have a normal conversation without shouting.” UGI has spent millions of dollars on sound attenuation via Noise Solutions Inc., Stahl said, and the Kidder facility would be no different. Opponents, meanwhile, warn that the stations can be “as loud as an airport.” Christman also predicted the station will generate approximately 200 metric tons of pollutants annually into a “previously pristine environment.” “The pollutants include CH20 which is primarily formaldehyde; PM10 particle pollution which is highly associated with lung cancer; PM2.5 particle pollution which is the leading cause of mortality from cardiovascular disease; benzene, a cancer-causing compound; sulfur dioxide which smells like rotten eggs and is harmful to human health; and nitric oxide, the principal component of the smog that causes acid rain,” she added. Stahl said UGI meets all state and federal guidelines, and all air emissions are well below the Environmental Protection Agency standard. The Kidder Township Zoning Hearing Board will consider PennEast’s compressor station application at 6 p.m. Monday at the Galleria at Split Rock Resort.

The Dow Jones industrial average ended about 40 points lower, with Procter & Gamble contributing the most losses. The S&P 500 fell nearly 0.2 percent and extended its losing streak to nine sessions, with consumer staples leading decliners. The S&P's losing streak is the longest in almost 36 years. During that streak, the index has fallen nearly 3 percent. The Nasdaq composite fell about a quarter of a percent. The three major indexes all posted weekly losses. "Nobody wants to do anything today. ... Everybody is on hold for Tuesday," said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. "I think next week you'll start seeing Wall Street coronate winners and losers. What I mean is you're going to start seeing investors switching sectors very quickly." The CBOE Volatility Index, widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, rose 3.76 percent to trade near 22.9. The so-called fear gauge is also up more than 40 percent this week. The race between Republican Donald Trump and his Democratic counterpart, Hillary Clinton , has become tighter since last week, when the FBI said it was investigating new emails related to Clinton. According to data from RealClearPolitics, the average spread between Clinton and trump is now just 1.7 points in a four-way race, down from about 5 points last week. "The market is pricing in a Hillary Clinton victory, but it's also been pricing in a split ticket, with Clinton taking the White House and a split in Congress," said Tom Siomades, head of Hartford Funds Investment Consulting Group. "It seems like the market is obsessed with the election," said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, adding that price movements around an election are "very much a short-term thing." On the data front, jobs in the U.S. grew by 161,000 last month , while economists polled by Reuters expected an increase of 175,000. The unemployment rate stood at 4.9 percent —in line with expectations —as investors got to digest the final payrolls report before Tuesday's presidential election. "I would consider this a middle-of-the road report. I think the interesting thing about the report is that Hurricane Matthew didn't adversely affect jobs growth. In the past, we've seen hurricanes depress jobs growth," said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor. But the bigger number in the report could be wages, with average hourly earnings climbing 10 cents and reflecting a 2.8 percent annualized increase, according to the report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "This is a pretty positive wages picture and it's what you'd expect to see with such low unemployment," Glassdoor's Chamberlain said. Investors have been paying even more attention to U.S. economic data as they try to determine the likelihood of the Federal Reserve raising rates. Hartford Funds' Siomades said this jobs report "will lock in the December rate hike," adding that any number around these levels would have been "a green light for the Fed." U.S. Treasurys traded higher, with the two-year note yield near 0.79 percent and the benchmark 10-year yield around 1.77 percent. The U.S. dollar fell against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.113 and the yen around 103. "Things are hot, when it comes to the US economy and today's number has cement that idea. You can criticise the Fed that they are thinking of increasing the interest rate when the GDP growth could be slowing for the final quarter of this year," Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said in a note. "But the fact is that the Fed is very close in achieving their GDP, inflation and unemployment target. Throughout this year, they have been aching to increase the rate," he said. In a speech, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said Fed rate hikes over the next two years would be very gradual. "I anticipate a very gradually rising interest rate environment over the next two years...I do not see rates marching higher for an extended period in a preprogrammed tightening campaign. The economy does not call for that, at least not at this time," he said. Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said in another speech that the case for a rate hike was strengthening. and Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said the labor market is strong and the central bank could overshoot its goals. In oil markets, U.S. crude prices whipsawed, settling 1.32 percent lower at $44.07 per barrel, after OPEC's secretary general denied reports of tensions resurfacing between Saudi Arabia and Iran that could scupper a key output cut deal. WTI had briefly traded positive after the news broke. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 42.39 points, or 0.24 percent, to close at 17,888.28, with Procter & Gamble leading decliners and Caterpillar the top advancer. The S&P 500 fell 3.48 point, or 0.17 percent, to end at 2,085.18, with health care leading five sectors higher and consumer staples the biggest laggard. The Nasdaq fell 12.04 points, or 0.24 percent, to 5,046.37. Advancers were a step ahead of decliners at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 902.51 million and a composite volume of 3.774 billion at the close. Gold futures for December delivery rose $1.20 to settle at $1,304.50 per ounce. — CNBC's Jeff Cox and Reuters contributed to this report.   And the Best Place to Work in the global financial markets 2016 is...

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ By Rita Nazareth, Dani Burger and Yun Li | Bloomberg US stocks posted their longest slide since 1980, while Treasuries rallied after data showing progress in the American labor market did little to soothe anxiety over the presidential election. Oil slumped. The S&P 500 Index dropped for a ninth straight day, a gauge of equity volatility had the longest stretch of gains on record and Treasuries climbed the most since September ahead of next week's vote. All the jitters sent the dollar down after a brief advance that followed data showing U.S. jobs rose at a steady pace in October, supporting a Federal Reserve hike next month. Oil sank as hopes faded that OPEC will be able to implement a deal to cut output. Traders have piled into relatively safer assets as opinion polls showed the U.S. presidential race tightening after Hillary Clinton seemed poised for victory. While American stocks have almost always risen in the days before a presidential election, anxiety about the outcome of the Nov. 8 vote has weighed on the market this time, overshadowing key reports such as the jobs data. "The jobs number should increase rate-hike odds and push up the dollar further, but nothing is happening in the markets ahead of the election," said Dennis Debusschere, a senior managing director and global portfolio strategist at Evercore ISI in New York. "All expectations of the rate outlook and by extension the markets are being muted by election uncertainty." Republican nominee Donald Trump showed strength in Iowa and Ohio pre-Election Day voting, while Clinton's advantage in early balloting looked favorable in North Carolina and Nevada, according to a Bloomberg Politics analysis. A report today showed payrolls climbed by 161,000 last month following a 191,000 gain in September that was larger than previously estimated. Wages rose from a year earlier by the most since 2009, and the jobless rate fell to 4.9 percent. The figures are likely to keep the Fed on track to raise borrowing costs next month for the first time in 2016. Stocks The S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent to 2,085.18 at 4 p.m. in New York, after erasing a 0.5 percent advance. The gauge fell to as low as 2,083, its average price during the past 200 days, and a technical level it hasn't breached since the rout that followed the U.K.'s June vote to leave the European Union. The CBOE Volatility Index surged 73 percent in nine days. "The U.S. elections are the elephant in the room for markets at the moment," said Christian Gatticker, Zurich-based head of research at Julius Baer Group Ltd. "The best case is gridlock where Hillary wins and works with a Republican Congress, while a worst case is a hung vote." Equities faded in afternoon trading as declines among consumer, financial and energy shares overshadowed gains in drugmakers. Procter & Gamble Co. and Amazon.com Inc. sank more than 1.5 percent. Insurer Willis Towers Watson Plc tumbled after cutting its full-year revenue forecast, and Wells Fargo & Co. lost 1.6 percent. Crude's drop weighed on oil producers. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index extended its weekly slide to 3.5 percent, the biggest since February. Erste Group Bank AG sank after Austria's biggest bank forecast lower profitability next year. Commerzbank AG slipped after the German lender swung to a loss in the third quarter. Cie. Financiere Richemont SA jumped as the maker of Piaget jewelry unveiled a sweeping overhaul of top management and its board as it reported a plunge in sales. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index of equities fell for a fourth day, slipping 0.5 percent. Currencies The dollar fell for a sixth straight day, the longest stretch of losses since March, as traders kept their focus on the vote for the White House. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index lost 0.2 percent, erasing earlier gains. The greenback fell 0.3 percent to $1.1137 per euro and was little changed at 103.07 yen. "It would be difficult for the market to move much given the elections on Tuesday," said Andres Jaime, a foreign-exchange strategist in New York at Barclays Plc. The pound posted its best week since 2009 as a flurry of news offered relief for the currency. Sterling climbed on speculation a High Court ruling will delay or soften the terms of the nation's exit from the European Union and it received a further boost when the Bank of England said it's no longer expecting to cut interest rates again this year. Turkey's lira led losses among 24 emerging-market peers. A court ordered the nation's most prominent Kurdish lawmakers jailed, sharply escalating a crackdown personally led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and spurring fears of renewed violence and a possible rupture with the West. China's yuan dropped to a record low against a trade-weighted currency basket amid speculation policy makers are using recent dollar weakness to boost the competitiveness of the nation's exporters. Bonds Treasury two-year note yields fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 0.79 percent, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. Benchmark 10-year note yields declined four basis points to 1.78 percent. The employment report "was on target, but it wasn't overly strong," said Timothy High, U.S. strategist at BNP Paribas SA in New York, one of 23 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. "Given that it's out of the way, the focus is more towards the uncertainty next week, the election clearly. The uncertainty will bring in some buying." Global bond markets are coming off their worst month in two years amid investor concern that major central banks are preparing to gradually reduce unprecedented monetary stimulus. The Fed's policy committee this week cited signs that inflation is accelerating as it said the case for higher borrowing costs had strengthened, even as it left its key rate target unchanged. Futures traders assigned about a 74 percent probability of tighter policy by December, up from a 69 percent chance seen a week ago. Commodities The Bloomberg Commodity Index fell 3.1 percent this week, the most since July 8. Oil dropped 1.3 percent in New York, bringing the six-session decline to 11 percent. Prices closed Thursday at the lowest level since OPEC reached a preliminary accord in Algiers for the cuts, and extended losses Friday after Reuters reported that Saudi Arabia threatened to raise output if other members didn't agree to cuts. Losses eased after OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo said the kingdom didn't make the threat. "We're not seeing any path for an OPEC agreement," said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy. "There's too much output growth in OPEC outside of Saudi Arabia. It's asking too much of Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies to make the cuts needed for this to work." West Texas Intermediate for December delivery dropped 59 cents to settle at $44.07 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent for January settlement fell 77 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $45.58 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Gold held near a one-month high as it was caught in the crossfire between haven demand and prospects for higher U.S. interest rates.

Photo: Bloomberg New York: US stocks posted their longest slide since 1980, while Treasuries rallied after data showing progress in the American labour market did little to soothe anxiety over the presidential election. Oil slumped. The S&P 500 Index dropped for a ninth straight day, a gauge of equity volatility had the longest stretch of gains on record and Treasuries climbed the most since September ahead of next week’s vote. All the jitters sent the dollar down after a brief advance that followed data showing US jobs rose at a steady pace in October, supporting a Federal Reserve hike next month. Oil sank as hopes faded that Opec will be able to implement a deal to cut output. Traders have piled into relatively safer assets as opinion polls showed the US presidential race tightening after Hillary Clinton seemed poised for victory. While American stocks have almost always risen in the days before a presidential election, anxiety about the outcome of the 8 November vote has weighed on the market this time, overshadowing key reports such as the jobs data. “The jobs number should increase rate-hike odds and push up the dollar further, but nothing is happening in the markets ahead of the election,” said Dennis Debusschere, a senior managing director and global portfolio strategist at Evercore ISI in New York. “All expectations of the rate outlook and by extension the markets are being muted by election uncertainty.” Republican nominee Donald Trump showed strength in Iowa and Ohio pre-Election Day voting, while Clinton’s advantage in early balloting looked favourable in North Carolina and Nevada, according to a Bloomberg analysis. A report on Saturday showed payrolls climbed by 161,000 last month following a 191,000 gain in September that was larger than previously estimated. Wages rose from a year earlier by the most since 2009, and the jobless rate fell to 4.9%. The figures are likely to keep the Fed on track to raise borrowing costs next month for the first time in 2016. Stocks The S&P 500 fell 0.2% to 2,085.18 at 4pm in New York, after erasing a 0.5% advance. The gauge fell to as low as 2,083, its average price during the past 200 days, and a technical level it hasn’t breached since the rout that followed the UK’s June vote to leave the European Union. The CBOE Volatility Index surged 73% in nine days. “The US elections are the elephant in the room for markets at the moment,” said Christian Gatticker, Zurich-based head of research at Julius Baer Group Ltd. “The best case is gridlock where Hillary wins and works with a Republican Congress, while a worst case is a hung vote.” Equities faded in afternoon trading as declines among consumer, financial and energy shares overshadowed gains in drugmakers. Procter & Gamble Co. and Amazon.com Inc. sank more than 1.5%. Insurer Willis Towers Watson Plc tumbled after cutting its full-year revenue forecast, and Wells Fargo & Co. lost 1.6%. Crude’s drop weighed on oil producers. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index extended its weekly slide to 3.5%, the biggest since February. Erste Group Bank AG sank after Austria’s biggest bank forecast lower profitability next year. Commerzbank AG slipped after the German lender swung to a loss in the third quarter. Cie. Financiere Richemont SA jumped as the maker of Piaget jewelry unveiled a sweeping overhaul of top management and its board as it reported a plunge in sales. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index of equities fell for a fourth day, slipping 0.5%. Currencies The dollar fell for a sixth straight day, the longest stretch of losses since March, as traders kept their focus on the vote for the White House. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index lost 0.2%, erasing earlier gains. The greenback fell 0.3% to $1.1137 per euro and was little changed at ¥103.07. “It would be difficult for the market to move much given the elections on Tuesday,” said Andres Jaime, a foreign-exchange strategist in New York at Barclays Plc. The pound posted its best week since 2009 as a flurry of news offered relief for the currency. Sterling climbed on speculation a High Court ruling will delay or soften the terms of the nation’s exit from the European Union and it received a further boost when the Bank of England said it’s no longer expecting to cut interest rates again this year. Turkey’s lira led losses among 24 emerging-market peers. A court ordered the nation’s most prominent Kurdish lawmakers jailed, sharply escalating a crackdown personally led by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and spurring fears of renewed violence and a possible rupture with the West. China’s yuan dropped to a record low against a trade-weighted currency basket amid speculation policy makers are using recent dollar weakness to boost the competitiveness of the nation’s exporters. Bonds Treasury two-year note yields fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 0.79%, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. Benchmark 10-year note yields declined four basis points to 1.78%. The employment report “was on target, but it wasn’t overly strong,” said Timothy High, US strategist at BNP Paribas SA in New York, one of 23 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “Given that it’s out of the way, the focus is more towards the uncertainty next week, the election clearly. The uncertainty will bring in some buying.” Global bond markets are coming off their worst month in two years amid investor concern that major central banks are preparing to gradually reduce unprecedented monetary stimulus. The Fed’s policy committee this week cited signs that inflation is accelerating as it said the case for higher borrowing costs had strengthened, even as it left its key rate target unchanged. Futures traders assigned about a 74% probability of tighter policy by December, up from a 69% chance seen a week ago. Commodities The Bloomberg Commodity Index fell 3.1% this week, the most since 8 July. Oil dropped 1.3% in New York, bringing the six-session decline to 11%. Prices closed on Thursday at the lowest level since Opec reached a preliminary accord in Algiers for the cuts, and extended losses Friday after Reuters reported that Saudi Arabia threatened to raise output if other members didn’t agree to cuts. Losses eased after Opec secretary-general Mohammed Barkindo said the kingdom didn’t make the threat. “We’re not seeing any path for an Opec agreement,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy. “There’s too much output growth in Opec outside of Saudi Arabia. It’s asking too much of Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies to make the cuts needed for this to work.” West Texas Intermediate for December delivery dropped 59 cents to settle at $44.07 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent for January settlement fell 77 cents, or 1.7%, to $45.58 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Gold held near a one-month high as it was caught in the crossfire between haven demand and prospects for higher US interest rates.

Dla S&P to już dziewiąta spadkowa sesja z rzędu. Dane z rynku pracy USA wzmocniły oczekiwania na podwyżkę stóp w grudniu. Rynek nerwowo obserwuje przebieg kampanii prezydenckiej w USA i najnowsze sondaże. Dow Jones Industrial na koniec dnia stracił 0,24 proc. i wyniósł 17.888,28 pkt. S&P 500 spadł o 0,17 proc. i wyniósł 2.085,18 pkt. Indeks ten spada już dziewiątą sesję z rzędu, co jest najdłuższą taką serią od prawie 36 lat. Nasdaq Comp. zniżkował o 0,24 proc. do 5.046,37 pkt. W centrum uwagi znalazł się w piątek najnowszy raport z amerykańskiego rynku pracy. Liczba miejsc pracy w sektorach pozarolniczych w Stanach Zjednoczonych w październiku wzrosła o 161 tys. wobec 191 tys. przed miesiącem po korekcie z 156 tys. Stopa bezrobocia w USA w październiku wyniosła 4,9 proc. Wzrost płacy godzinowej w ujęciu rocznym w październiku był najmocniejszy od czerwca 2009 r. Solidne dane z rynku pracy USA mogą utwierdzić rynek w przekonaniu o podwyżce stóp procentowych podczas grudniowego posiedzenia Rezerwy Federalnej. Prawdopodobieństwo podwyżki stóp w następnym miesiącu, wyceniane przez kontrakty na stopę Fed, wynosi 78 proc. Od pewnego czasu sytuację na rynku kształtuje nerwowe oczekiwanie inwestorów na wyniki wyborów prezydenckich w USA. Niepewność jest na tyle duża, że indeks S&P zakończył spadkami już dziewięć sesji z rzędu. Rynki uważnie śledzą sondaże przedwyborcze w USA. W piątkowym badaniu ABC News/Washington Post Clinton zgromadziła 47 proc. poparcia, a Trump 44 proc. Po okresie ciszy medialnej związanej z posiedzeniem Rezerwy Federalnej, jej członkowie ponownie rozpoczynają publiczne wystąpienia. W piątek Dennis Lockhart, prezes Fed z Atlanty, ocenił, iż październikowy raport z rynku pracy USA jest "satysfakcjonujący", a podwyżki stóp w USA w ciągu najbliższych dwóch lat będą "bardzo stopniowe". Z indeksu Dow Jones najlepiej zachowywały się akcje Home Depot. W dół indeks ciągnęły m.in. Procter and Gamble. Najlepiej radziły sobie spółki z sektora opieki zdrowotnej oraz przemysłowe. Na minusie znalazły się przedsiębiorstwa z sektora dóbr podstawowych. Do tej pory ok. 80 proc. firm notowanych na S&P 500 podało swoje wyniki kwartalne, z czego 75 proc. pozytywnie zaskoczyło zyskami, a 56 proc. sprzedażą. W czwartek po zakończeniu sesji raporty przedstawiły m.in. Kraft Heinz i Starbucks. Wyniki Kraft rozczarowały inwestorów, a spółka traciła w trakcie piątkowych notowań nawet 4 proc. W reakcji na wyniki kurs Starbucks zwyżkował blisko 3 proc. Ponad 7 proc. taniały walory Willis Watson. Ubezpieczyciel obniżył prognozę przychodów na 2016 r. Mimo rosnących szans na wzrost kosztu pieniądza w USA, od wtorku dolar osłabił się wobec euro o 1,5 proc., a od minimum z 25 X - już o 2,5 proc. Kurs EUR/USD znajduje się w okolicach 1,11. Po czwartkowym orzeczeniu Wysokiego Trybunału, sądu najwyższego Wielkiej Brytanii, w opinii rynku i komentatorów oddaliła się perspektywa "twardego Brexitu", co wpływa na umocnienie funta. Kurs GBP/USD rósł w piątek do ponad 1,25 i znajduje się już tylko 0,5 proc. poniżej notowań sprzed "flash-crashu" z 7 października. Najtańsza w historii jest turecka lira. W nocy turecka policja aresztowała przywódców prokurdyjskiej Ludowej Partii Demokratycznej (HDP), która jest trzecią siłą w tureckim parlamencie. Po południu sąd zdecydował o ich tymczasowym aresztowaniu. Kolejną spadkową sesję zaliczyła ropa naftowa, która do piątku wytraciła wszystko, co udało jej się zyskać po wrześniowym posiedzeniu krajów OPEC w Algierze. Agencje donoszą, że w ubiegłym tygodniu Arabia Saudyjska zagroziła, iż zwiększy wydobycie nawet do 12 mln baryłek dziennie, po tym jak Iran nie zgodził się na ograniczenie wydobycia poniżej 4 mln baryłek. Obecnie Saudowie pompują dziennie na powierzchnię 10,5-10,7 mln baryłek. Informacjom tym zaprzeczył jednak Mohammed Barkindo, sekretarz generalny OPEC. Baryłka Brent taniała nawet o 2 proc. do ok. 45,4 USD, a baryłka WTI kosztowała przez moment poniżej 44 USD. Od poniedziałku cena Brent spadła o ok. 10 proc., a to oznacza, że tydzień zakończy największą tygodniową stratą od 9 miesięcy. Europejskie indeksy już dziesiątą sesję z rzędu zakończyły na minusach. Niemiecki indeks DAX stracił na zamknięciu sesji 0,65 proc., francuski CAC 40 spadł o 0,78 proc., a brytyjski FTSE 100 zniżkował 1,43 proc. Nawet 7 proc. w dół zniżkował kurs Erste, a notowania Commerzbanku traciły ok. 1 proc., po publikacji kwartalnych wyników, które inwestorzy odczytali negatywnie. Walory Financiere Richemont, producenta biżuterii, zyskiwały ponad 5 proc., po ogłoszeniu zmian w kierownictwie spółki w odpowiedzi na słabe wyniki kwartalne. Bez większych zmian pozostał kurs BMW, który zaraportował wyższy niż rok wcześniej zysk. 2 proc. zyskiwał L'Oreal. Inwestorzy pozytywnie przyjęli wyższy od konsensusu wzrost sprzedaży producenta kosmetyków. Ponad 3 proc. taniały walory IAG, właściciela British Airways. Spółka obniżyła prognozę zysku na lata 2016-2020 do 5,3 mld euro z 5,6 mld euro. PODWYŻKI STÓP W USA BARDZO STOPNIOWE, PAYROLLE ZA X "SATYSFAKCJONUJĄCE" - LOCKART, FED Październikowy raport z rynku pracy USA jest "satysfakcjonujący" - ocenił w piątek Dennis Lockhart, prezes Fed z Atlanty. Jego zdaniem, podwyżki stóp procentowych w USA w ciągu najbliższych dwóch lat będą "bardzo stopniowe". Dodał, iż nie oczekuje, by stopy procentowe w USA wzrastały przez dłuższy czas "zaplanowanej z góry kampanii zacieśniania". Jego zdaniem, decyzje ws. kosztu pieniądza będą opierać się na twardych danych "z posiedzenia na posiedzenie". Lockhart ocenił, iż wzrost PKB w USA w 2016 r. wyniesie nieco poniżej 2 proc., a w IV kw. 2016 r. oraz w 2017 r. wyniesie ok. 2 proc. Lockhart powiedział również, iż obecnie nie widzi poważnych przesłanek recesji w USA. ZNACZNA REWIZJA W GÓRĘ PAYROLLI ZA IX, MOCNY WZROST PŁACY GODZINOWEJ Liczba miejsc pracy w sektorach pozarolniczych w Stanach Zjednoczonych w październiku wzrosła o 161 tys. wobec 191 tys. przed miesiącem po korekcie. Łączna korekta liczby nowych miejsc pracy za ostatnie dwa miesiące wynosiła +44 tys. Liczba miejsc pracy w amerykańskim sektorze prywatnym wzrosła o 142 tys., podczas gdy miesiąc wcześniej wzrosła o 188 tys. po korekcie. Analitycy ankietowani przez agencję Bloomberg spodziewali się stopy bezrobocia w USA na poziomie 4,9 proc. oraz że liczba miejsc pracy w sektorach pozarolniczych wzrośnie o 173 tys. wobec 156 tys. we wrześniu przed korektą, a w sektorze prywatnym wzrośnie o 170 tys. wobec wzrostu o 167 tys. miesiąc wcześniej przed korektą. Stopa bezrobocia w USA w październiku wyniosła 4,9 proc., wobec 5,0 proc. we wrześniu. Wynagrodzenia godzinowe wzrosły w październiku o 0,4 proc. mdm, po wzroście o 0,3 proc. miesiąc wcześniej po korekcie wobec 0,2 proc. przed korektą. W ujęciu rocznym wynagrodzenia godzinowe w październiku wzrosły o 2,8 proc., po wzroście o 2,7 proc. we wrześniu po korekcie, wobec 2,6 proc. przed korektą. Tu spodziewano się odczytów odpowiednio na poziomie: 0,3 proc. i 2,6 proc. S&P 500 STRACI 5 PROC. PO ZWYCIĘSTWIE TRUMPA - CITI Zwycięstwo Donalda Trumpa w wyborach prezydenckich spowoduje natychmiastowy spadek indeksu S&P 500 o ok. 3-5 proc. - ocenili w piątek analitycy Citi. W długim terminie, ich zdaniem, wygrana Trumpa wprowadza ryzyko niższego wzrostu gospodarczego lub recesji, jeżeli dojdzie do wprowadzenia ograniczeń w handlu oraz ograniczenia ekspansji fiskalnej. ZYSK I PRZYCHODY STARBUCKS ZGODNE Z OCZEKIWANIAMI Zysk Starbucks wyniósł w IV kwartale obecnego roku podatkowego 56 centów na akcję wobec szacowanych przez analityków 55 centów na akcję. Przychody firmy wzrosły w IV kw. (zakończył się 2 października 2016) o 16 procent do 5,71 miliarda dolarów - podał Starbucks. Analitycy spodziewali się zaś 5,69 miliarda dolarów. Firma podwyższyła kwartalną dywidendę do 25 centów na akcję z 20 centów. Sieć kawiarni nie sprostała jednak oczekiwaniom rynkowym, jeśli chodzi o globalną sprzedaż - w IV kwartale wzrosła ona o 4,0 proc., podczas gdy analitycy oczekiwali wzrostu o 4,8 proc. Starbucks prognozuje w roku podatkowym 2017 dwucyfrowy wzrost przychodów, a zysk na akcję - w przedziale 2,12-2,14 USD. Analitycy spodziewają się jednak po tej firmie lepszych danych - zysku na poziomie 2,16 USD na akcję. DOBRY WYNIK KRAFT HEINZ W III KW. Amerykański gigant spożywczy Kraft Heinz, z siedzibą w Pittsburgu, podał, że w III kwartale jego skorygowany zysk na akcję wzrósł rdr o 89 procent i wyniósł 83 centy wobec 44 centów na akcję w III kw. 2015. Wynik zaskoczył analityków, którzy spodziewali się kwartalnego zysku na poziomie 74 centów na akcję. Przychody za III kwartał jednak nieznacznie spadły - o 1,5 proc., z 6,36 miliarda dolarów do 6,27 mld USD, co jest nieco poniżej 6,3 mld dolarów szacowanych przez analityków. ZYSK ERSTE BEZ ZASKOCZEŃ, PROGNOZY CIĄGNĄ KURS W DÓŁ Zysk netto Erste Banku w III kw. wyniósł 337,4 mln euro, zgodnie z oczekiwaniami. W analogicznym okresie ubiegłego roku bank wypracował 277 mln euro zysku. Wynik odsetkowy banku wyniósł 1,07 mld euro wobec 1,11 mld euro oczekiwań. Jednocześnie bank poinformował o obniżce prognoz dla wysokości kluczowego wskaźnika rentowności do 10 proc. z 12 proc. KWARTALNA STRATA COMMERZBANK, PROGNOZY ZYSKU ZA CAŁY ROK Commerzbank zaraportował stratę netto za III kw. w wysokości 288 mln euro, wobec 235 mln euro zysku w analogicznym okresie ubiegłego roku. Oczekiwano tymczasem straty rzędu 475 mln euro. Bank poinformował, iż oczekuje dodatniego wyniku netto na koniec roku. Współczynnik Tier 1 banku wzrósł do 11,8 proc. z 11,5 proc. w ubiegłym kwartale. Bank oczekuje wzrostu współczynnika do 12 proc. na koniec 2016 r. Commerzbank przechodzi restrukturyzację, zamierzając zlikwidować co piąte miejsce pracy. WYNIKI L'OREAL POWYŻEJ OCZEKIWAŃ Sprzedaż porównywalna L'Oreal w III kw. wzrosła o 5,6 proc. rdr, o 1,1 pkt. proc. powyżej rynkowych oczekiwań. Za udany dla firmy kwartał odpowiada w szczególności wzrost sprzedaży o 7,5 proc. w Ameryce Północnej. Przychody L'Oreal wyniosły 6,15 mld euro, wobec 6,09 mld konsensusu.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    The S&P 500 Index extended its longest losing streak in more than three decades, as data bolstered speculation interest rates will rise before year-end and investors remained wary before the looming presidential election. Equities faded in afternoon trading as an advance led by drugmakers lost momentum, overshadowed by declines among consumer, financial and energy shares. Procter & Gamble Co. and Amazon.com Inc. were among the biggest drags. Insurer Willis Towers Watson Plc tumbled 5.6 percent after cutting its full-year revenue forecast. The S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent to 2,085.33 at 4 p.m. in New York, after erasing a 0.5 percent advance. The gauge capped a ninth straight drop, the longest since 1980, during which it’s declined 3.1 percent. “The jobs number should increase rate-hike odds and push up the dollar further, but nothing is happening in the markets ahead of the election,” said Dennis Debusschere, a senior managing director and global portfolio strategist at Evercore ISI in New York. “All expectations of the rate outlook and by extension the markets are being muted by election uncertainty.” A report today showed payrolls climbed by 161,000 last month following a 191,000 gain in September that was larger than previously estimated. Wages rose from a year earlier by the most since 2009, and the jobless rate fell to 4.9 percent. The figures are likely to keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise borrowing costs next month for the first time in 2016. While shares have almost always risen in the days before a presidential election, anxiety about the outcome of the Nov. 8 vote has weighed on stocks, overshadowing even a Fed meeting earlier this week. The S&P 500 fell Friday as low as 2,083, its average price during the past 200 days, and a technical level it hasn’t breached since the rout that followed the U.K.’s June vote to leave the European Union. The S&P 500 posted a fourth weekly decline in the last five, down 1.9 percent as polls showed a dwindling lead for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Republican nominee Donald Trump showed strength in Iowa and Ohio pre-Election Day voting, while Clinton’s advantage in early balloting looked favorable in North Carolina and Nevada, according to a Bloomberg Politics analysis. The tightening race sent the CBOE Volatility Index to its longest streak of gains ever, and dragged the S&P 500 to a four-month low. “The U.S. elections are the elephant in the room for markets at the moment,” said Christian Gatticker, Zurich-based head of research at Julius Baer Group Ltd. “The best case is gridlock where Hillary wins and works with a Republican Congress, while a worst case is a hung vote.” Hedge fund manager Dan Loeb said he’s cutting risk in his portfolio ahead of the vote on concern that surprises could rattle financial markets. “We’ve reduced our exposures, we’ve cut some positions and increased some hedges,” Loeb said Friday in a conference call discussing results at Third Point Reinsurance Ltd., the Bermuda-based insurer where he oversees investments. “And it isn’t just about the president. Obviously who wins is going to impact the market. I think equally important is what happens in the House and Senate.” Before today’s payrolls report and the approaching election, the Fed on Wednesday kept rates unchanged in a widely expected move, and indicated the argument for raising them has strengthened. Other data this week was mixed, with modest expansion in manufacturing last month, while services industries growth slowed. Traders are pricing in a 76 percent chance the central bank will act in December, up from 69 percent a week ago. “It’s worth noting that unemployment is the single best determining factor of market direction,” said Ross Yarrow, director of U.S. Equities at Robert W. Baird & Co. In London. “The S&P 500 almost never peaks for the cycle until unemployment troughs.” Traders are also parsing corporate results as the earnings season winds down. More than four out of five S&P 500 companies have reported so far, with 56 percent beating sales estimates and 75 percent topping profit forecasts. Analyst predict earnings for members of the index grew 2.5 percent in the July-September period, snapping a five-quarter stretch of declines. © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved.

Procter & Gamble and Amazon.com were among the biggest drags. Insurer Willis Towers Watson tumbled 5.6 percent after cutting its full-year revenue forecast. Equities remain on pace for a fourth weekly decline in the last five, as polls showed a dwindling lead for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Photo: Richard Drew The S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent to 2085.33 at 4 p.m. in New York, after erasing a 0.5 per cent advance. The gauge capped a ninth straight drop, the longest since 1980, during which it's declined 3.1 per cent. "The jobs number should increase rate-hike odds and push up the dollar further, but nothing is happening in the markets ahead of the election," said Dennis Debusschere, a senior managing director and global portfolio strategist at Evercore ISI in New York."All expectations of the rate outlook and by extension the markets are being muted by election uncertainty." A report today showed payrolls climbed by 161,000 last month following a 191,000 gain in September that was larger than previously estimated. Wages rose from a year earlier by the most since 2009, and the jobless rate fell to 4.9 per cent. The figures are likely to keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise borrowing costs next month for the first time in 2016. While shares have almost always risen in the days before a presidential election, anxiety about the outcome of the November 8 vote has weighed on stocks, overshadowing even a Fed meeting earlier this week. The S&P 500 fell Friday as low as 2083, its average price during the past 200 days, and a technical level it hasn't breached since the rout that followed the UK's June vote to leave the European Union. Advertisement The S&P 500 posted a fourth weekly decline in the last five, down 1.9 per cent as polls showed a dwindling lead for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Republican nominee Donald Trump showed strength in Iowa and Ohio pre-Election Day voting, while Clinton's advantage in early balloting looked favourable in North Carolina and Nevada, according to a Bloomberg Politics analysis. The tightening race sent the CBOE Volatility Index to its longest streak of gains ever, and dragged the S&P 500 to a four-month low. "The US elections are the elephant in the room for markets at the moment," said Christian Gatticker, Zurich-based head of research at Julius Baer Group. "The best case is gridlock where Hillary wins and works with a Republican Congress, while a worst case is a hung vote." Loeb cuts risk Hedge fund manager Dan Loeb said he's cutting risk in his portfolio ahead of the vote on concern that surprises could rattle financial markets. "We've reduced our exposures, we've cut some positions and increased some hedges," Loeb said Friday in a conference call discussing results at Third Point Reinsurance Ltd., the Bermuda-based insurer where he oversees investments. "And it isn't just about the president. Obviously who wins is going to impact the market. I think equally important is what happens in the House and Senate." Before today's payrolls report and the approaching election, the Fed on Wednesday kept rates unchanged in a widely expected move, and indicated the argument for raising them has strengthened. Other data this week was mixed, with modest expansion in manufacturing last month, while services industries growth slowed. Traders are pricing in a 76 per cent chance the central bank will act in December, up from 69 per cent a week ago. "It's worth noting that unemployment is the single best determining factor of market direction," said Ross Yarrow, director of US equities at Robert W. Baird & Co in London. "The S&P 500 almost never peaks for the cycle until unemployment troughs." Traders are also parsing corporate results as the earnings season winds down. More than four out of five S&P 500 companies have reported so far, with 56 per cent beating sales estimates and 75 per cent topping profit forecasts. Analyst predict earnings for members of the index grew 2.5 per cent in the July-September period, snapping a five-quarter stretch of declines.​ After the closing bell, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said third-quarter operating profit rose 6.6 per cent on contributions from newly acquired manufacturing businesses. Operating earnings, which exclude some investment results, climbed to $US4.85 billion, or $US2951 a share, from $US4.55 billion, or $US2769, a year earlier, according to a statement from the Omaha, Nebraska-based company. That missed the average $US3058-a-share estimate of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net income fell 24 per cent from a year earlier when Buffett booked a large gain on an investment in Kraft Heinz Co. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta president Dennis Lockhart signalled the US central bank was on track to raise interest rates next month, provided nothing intervened to give policy makers "pause". "There's a relatively high bar, at least in pure economic terms, a relatively high bar to not moving in December," Lockhart told reporters on Friday in Orlando, Florida. "There are other things that go on in the world that could give pause and I don't completely rule them out," he said, without providing specifics.

The Dow Jones industrial average held flat, with Caterpillar contributing the most gains and Procter & Gamble the most losses. The S&P 500 gained 0.1 percent and was looking to snap an eight-day losing streak, with health care rising more than 1 percent to lead advancers and consumer staples leading decliners. The Nasdaq composite held just above breakeven. “Nobody wants to do anything today. … Everybody is on hold for Tuesday,” said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. “I think next week you’ll start seeing Wall Street coronate winners and losers. What I mean is you’re going to start seeing investors switching sectors very quickly.” Read the full story › Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ShareEmail  Print Note: Read our discussion guidelines before commenting.

Please send us your startup announcements. Email is best: newchicagobusiness@gmail.com. Crain's contributor Robert Loerzel brings you news of fresh local startups every week. While she was on maternity leave from a job at Procter & Gamble, Chicagoan Allison Robinson decided to create the Mom Project, a website that matches women who want flexible work with project-based opportunities at companies. “It's challenging work with an emphasis on flexibility,” says Robinson, who left her job at P&G to launch the startup. “We're really trying to redefine the workplace for moms. It hasn't been very friendly.” Since the Mom Project launched in April, about 7,000 professionals have signed up for the website's free job-seeking service. “They're highly educated,” Robinson says. “They come from really great professional backgrounds, such as Boeing, Google, McDonald's, etc. They're so happy to stay on their career track but also be at home.” More than 150 companies are participating in the website, paying a fee to the Mom Project when they make a hire. Chicagoan Kimberly Grotto Howard, who owns Grotto Marketing, used the Mom Project to line up a work project with Braeside Condominium Management. She says she likes the tone that the Mom Project sets in conversations between job-seekers and employers. “It's almost like they look at you like a human being rather than a machine—from the beginning,” she says. Hidden down an alley in Evanston, The Barn opened for business Tuesday, Nov. 1, serving what it calls a “meat-centric” menu. The restaurant is inside a 19th-century brick barn at the rear of 1016 Church St. that once housed the stable of delivery horses for Borden Condensed Milk Co. The Barn's proprietor is Amy Morton, daughter of Arnie Morton, who founded Morton's Steakhouses, and the chef is Nicole Pederson. They're the same team that opened Found restaurant in Evanston four years ago. Barrington startup F3 Cycling seeks to raise $45,000 on Kickstarter to manufacture the FormMount Bicycle Computer Mount—an adjustable mount that holds GPS devices of any size above the handlebars of a bicycle. The campaign, which ends Nov. 20, has raised about $28,000 so far for the mount, which was created by Tim Boundy, Frank Pistorio and Mike Scalise. It's available for pledges starting at $43. The Apothecary is a deck of playing cards that change color when touched by hands. It's the creation of Chicagoan Alexander Chin, who runs Seasons Playing Cards and the Shung Shung package design studio. Chin has raised more than $50,000 with a Kickstarter campaign to launch the color-changing playing cards, more than meeting his $20,000 goal. With heat-sensitive technology, the cards will turn from juniper green to yellow or coral to lavender when they're handled. The cards are available for pledges starting at $14 while the campaign runs, through Nov. 16. Other new businesses we've spotted: Tytin Jewelry, a shop and studio, has opened at 4825 N. Western Ave. in Lincoln Square. In addition to offering her own jewelry, owner Tina Cannon sells pieces created by other independent designers as well as jewelry-making tools. And Tytin hosts workshops and provides studio space for jewelers to work. . . . Chicago-based Aligned Modern Health opened its eighth local wellness clinic on Tuesday, Nov. 1, at 1335 S. Michigan Ave. in the South Loop. Update: We reported earlier this year about Musically Human Theatre coming to Highland Park, but as Crain's now reports, the theater company has closed without producing a single show.

Published on November 04, 2016. Credit: iStock Most Popular Data-driven targeting on publishers' websites may be headed for a "natural correction," according to Chris Copeland, president of ad-tech platform Yieldbot. The correction, Mr. Copeland argues, will come as marketers trim spending on certain consumer targeting to compensate for rising minimum prices on publishers' inventory. His view isn't universally held -- more on that below -- but Mr. Copeland said several red flags have already materialized. In August, for example, No. 1 advertiser Procter & Gamble said data targeting had limited effectiveness for certain products. "I think what brands need to understand is what targeting is really a needle mover and what targeting makes them feel all warm and fuzzy," Mr. Copeland said. "It's a bit of, 'Do you really need a seven-course meal if a three-course meal is going to fill you up?'" In this scenario, the key change is the proliferation of header bidding ad technology, which has let premium publishers see that their inventory is often worth more than the bids they used to accept. "What header bidding meant for the marketplace is suddenly inventory that was historically bought at a lower price starts to rise," Mr. Copeland said. "There's more competition and different valuations to different inventory. And floor prices are being put into place." Should floor prices rise, sophisticated data overlays -- such as targeting that can tell marketers whether a given web surfer shopped at Walmart last week -- will get a hard look from advertisers. Chris Copeland, president at Yieldbot. Credit: YieldBot "Now everyone is better at understanding where their place is, what the cost is," Mr. Copeland said. "And I think we will start to see everyone reconsider where they invest and how they invest because it won't be as cheap as it was two or three years ago." Eric Eichmann, CEO of ad tech powerhouse Criteo, doesn't agree. "First, let's start with the premise of supply and demand," he said. "Advertising demand is not expected to change dramatically. And publisher inventory is not changing dramatically. The only thing that has changed is header bidding." Header bidding has increased revenue for publishers and costs for advertisers, but the disruption will "flush itself out in a couple of quarters," Mr. Eichmann argued. "Marketers will adapt their bidding strategy to reflect the fact that they are in a different bidding environment," Mr. Eichmann said. "Over time, we think the effects of header bidding will be substantially less, and the people who will win are those who are smart about how they bid in an environment where everybody is bidding at the same time." Related Stories Retail Websites Pile on the Ad Tech, but May Be Repeating Publishers' Mistakes Facebook Seizes Header Bidding to Challenge Google in Programmatic Ad Sales Header Bidding Wrappers Are the Next Ad-Tech Craze (for Large Publishers) Rubicon Project Lays Off 19%, Still Feeling the Pain From Header Bidding If that means publishers can't hike their minimum prices, data overlays won't face new scrutiny. Header bidding has gained widespread adoption from publishers -- and even retailers to an extent -- because it lets everyone bid on ad inventory at the same time. The previous prevailing system of so-called "waterfall auctions" went through groups of buyers in turn, accepting the first decent offer without getting bids from later groups in the queue. Buyers who don't have the technology to properly handle header bidding will wind up paying "$10 instead of $9," Mr. Eichmann said. But tactics will evolve, he said. "Fundamentally, the publisher inventory hasn't changed and the advertising demand hasn't changed, so over time I think the dynamics won't be as dramatic as you had in the beginning."

(Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images/AFP)  Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: The S&P 500 index fell on Friday (Nov 4) for the ninth straight day, with anxiety over the close White House race dragging equities markets down heading into the final weekend before the vote. The fall came despite relatively good news about the health of US jobs markets. The Labor Department reported Friday that the US economy had added a solid 161,000 new jobs in October while the unemployment rate edged lower to 4.9 per cent, a result which analysts said pointed to general all-around health in the economy and suggested the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates next month. The S&P closed down 3.48 points (0.17 per cent) at 2,085.18. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 42.39 points (0.24 per cent) to 17,888.28 while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also lost 12.04 points (0.24 per cent) to settle at 5,046.37. Uncertainty about next week's bitterly fought elections has roiled markets ever since the Federal Bureau of Investigation revealed on October 28 that it had uncovered new emails potentially tied to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Chris Low of FTN Financial said investors were girding themselves for the outcome of Tuesday's vote. "Last time the market was at this level was back in early July right after the terrible Shanghai sell off," he told AFP. "Most of the traders I talked to today said they are positioned and are now waiting for Tuesday, and then they'll make a decision where they go from there." Ohio-based consumer goods company Procter & Gamble was among the heaviest blue chip losers of the day, finishing down 1.8 per cent at US$85.08, erasing much of the gains made since reporting stronger third-quarter earnings last week. Oil majors were also mostly down, with Chevron falling 0.6 per cent and Exxon Mobil losing 0.1 per cent as crude prices continued to fall. Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer also finished in positive territory, up 0.4 per cent, as did the Israeli generics maker Teva, which gained 2.65 per cent and EpiPen producer Mylan, up 2.5 per cent. The sector had fallen sharply on Thursday when word of looming enforcement actions for price-fixing dragged stock prices in the sector downward. Coffee store chain Starbucks finished up 1.9 per cent, retreating from gains made earlier in the day after reporting a 23 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings. POUND UP ON BREXIT POLITICS The British pound though powered higher on Thursday's London court ruling that the British government would need parliamentary approval to officially move to pull out of the European Union. The pound pushed up to US$1.2519, its highest level in a month. "The High Court ruling has introduced a whole new set of political uncertainties," Rabobank analyst Jane Foley told AFP. "However, since most of these are seen as reducing the chances of a bitter divorce from the European Union's single market, the pound is better supported." Oil prices meanwhile fell again amid talk Saudi Arabia may raise output again to bring prices down if Iran fails to agree to OPEC production cuts. - AFP/ec Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

Published: 19:03 November 5, 2016 Bloomberg   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE New York: US stocks posted their longest slide since 1980, while Treasuries rallied after data showing progress in the American labour market did little to soothe anxiety over the presidential election. The S&P 500 index dropped for a ninth straight day, a gauge of equity volatility had the longest stretch of gains on record and Treasuries climbed the most since September ahead of this week’s vote. All the jitters sent the dollar down after a brief advance that followed data showing US jobs rose at a steady pace in October, supporting a Federal Reserve hike next month. Traders have piled into relatively safer assets as opinion polls showed the US presidential race tightening after Hillary Clinton seemed poised for victory. While American stocks have almost always risen in the days before a presidential election, anxiety about the outcome of the November 8 vote has weighed on the market this time, overshadowing key reports such as the jobs data. “The jobs number should increase rate-hike odds and push up the dollar further, but nothing is happening in the markets ahead of the election,” said Dennis Debusschere, a senior managing director and global portfolio strategist at Evercore ISI in New York. “All expectations of the rate outlook and by extension the markets are being muted by election uncertainty.” Republican nominee Donald Trump showed strength in Iowa and Ohio pre-Election Day voting, while Clinton’s advantage in early balloting looked favourable in North Carolina and Nevada, according to a Bloomberg Politics analysis. A report today showed payrolls climbed by 161,000 last month following a 191,000 gain in September that was larger than previously estimated. Wages rose from a year earlier by the most since 2009, and the jobless rate fell to 4.9 per cent. The figures are likely to keep the Fed on track to raise borrowing costs next month for the first time in 2016. The S&P 500 fell 0.2 per cent to 2,085.18 at 4pm in New York, after erasing a 0.5 per cent advance. The gauge fell to as low as 2,083, its average price during the past 200 days, and a technical level it hasn’t breached since the rout that followed the UK’s June vote to leave the European Union. The CBOE Volatility index surged 73 per cent in nine days. “The US elections are the elephant in the room for markets at the moment,” said Christian Gatticker, Zurich-based head of research at Julius Baer Group Ltd. “The best case is gridlock where Hillary wins and works with a Republican Congress, while a worst case is a hung vote.” Equities faded in afternoon trading as declines among consumer, financial and energy shares overshadowed gains in drugmakers. Procter & Gamble Co. and Amazon.com Inc sank more than 1.5 per cent. Insurer Willis Towers Watson Plc tumbled after cutting its full-year revenue forecast, and Wells Fargo & Co. lost 1.6 per cent. Crude’s drop weighed on oil producers. The Stoxx Europe 600 index extended its weekly slide to 3.5 per cent, the biggest since February. Erste Group Bank AG sank after Austria’s biggest bank forecast lower profitability next year. Commerzbank AG slipped after the German lender swung to a loss in the third quarter. Cie. Financiere Richemont SA jumped as the maker of Piaget jewellery unveiled a sweeping overhaul of top management and its board as it reported a plunge in sales. The MSCI Emerging Markets index of equities fell for a fourth day, slipping 0.5 per cent.

WVU, in partnership with the New River Gorge Regional Development Authority, will present the New River Gorge Regional Economic Summit Nov. 17 at Tamarack. “The Bureau of Business and Economic Research at WVU has been the source of economic expertise for decades, and our presentation of this event demonstrates our important role of thought leadership,” said John Deskins, director of the BBER. “The state is at an interesting juncture, and our economic forecasting and analysis is critical to the next steps outlined by West Virginia. “We look forward to providing this information … so that business leaders, policymakers and residents will have access to the information they need going forward.” The Eastern Panhandle event will host Andy Bauer, regional economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, who will present the U.S. Economic Outlook. Ray Owens, senior economist and policy advisor for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, will open the Beckley breakfast event. Deskins pointed out the Eastern Panhandle of WV has experienced positive growth in the past year, and cited the 2012 opening of Macy’s distribution center and the Procter & Gamble facility that is expected to open in 2017. Deskins said the P&G project will have a “ripple effect” and spur even more jobs. WVU Beckley/WVU Tech Campus President Carolyn Long will speak during the Beckley event, along with a post-election, nonpartisan discussion led by Brian Helmick of Spilman Thomas & Battle, to talk about what state residents and its business community can expect from the upcoming legislative session. Deskins said the Beckley region has seen economic opportunities in the realms of hospitality, tourism, health care and manufacturing, but significant declines in the coal industry have hurt the area. He predicts the formal, full-scale operation of the WVU Beckley Campus, which is expected to happen in fall 2017, will give the region a boost. “Stakeholders in our state have a lot of questions about where our economy is headed, and they want hard data and rigorous and unbiased economic analysis,” Deskins said. “I believe West Virginia is at a crossroads, and we must look to other sectors to boost our sagging economy. “The time in which the roles of alternative industries will play a major part has passed, and the urgency of planning for the future is here.” BusinessBusinessMore>> Bombardier plans West Virginia expansion Bombardier plans West Virginia expansion Updated: Tuesday, November 15 2016 10:57 AM EST2016-11-15 15:57:10 GMT Bombardier Aerospace plans to announce an expansion of its aftermarket service center at the West Virginia Air Center in Bridgeport.  Bombardier Aerospace plans to announce an expansion of its aftermarket service center at the West Virginia Air Center in Bridgeport.  AT&T offering computer science grants AT&T offering computer science grants Updated: Monday, November 14 2016 5:08 PM EST2016-11-14 22:08:54 GMT Executives with ATTInternetService are offering computer sciences grants to university professors and secondary school teachers to upgrade technology in their classrooms.

Fresh polls released yesterday, 3 November 2016 reportedly showed that Democrat Hillary Clinton, who is seen as the status quo candidate by markets, maintained her narrow lead over Republican Donald Trump. Investors generally view Clinton as a known quantity, but there is deep uncertainty about what a Trump win might mean for US economic policy, free trade and geopolitics.

this article CHICAGO, Nov. 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- With the Chicago Cubs heading into the playoffs in late September and no way to predict the outcome, Alison Miller, VP of Marketing for the Windy City's MLB team, had to think ahead. In addition to creating a new "Fly the W" campaign for the post season, she asked Schafer Condon Carter (SCC), the Cubs agency of record, to consider how to handle a potential World Series victory. It was an off-the-record assignment that had to be secretly planned and executed. SCC's idea was to memorialize the Cubs' journey to a World Series victory through the eyes of Cubs' fans set to a song from a very famous Cubs fan, Pearl Jam front man Eddie Vedder. His song, "Someday We'll Go All The Way," is a tribute to Cubs fans' passion–and their patience–in pursuit of that elusive World Series Championship.  "Those are truly human moments and emotions that you just can't create. You have to be there. They have to be real," said SCC's Leroy Koetz, who directed and edited the spot. "Eddie's track as the backdrop for these moments really tells a powerful story." Shot at dozens of locations throughout Chicago while the Cubs made their playoff run, the 60-second spot incorporates footage lensed at the conclusion of the Cubs dramatic 10th inning Game 7 win in Cleveland. The final edit was finished just a few hours before sunrise that morning.  "We wanted to capture the real, genuine emotion that true, die-hard Cub fans experienced during this amazing run," said SCC Creative Director, Ron Sone. "We thought it was important that we get the real thing at that critical moment." SCC's video production team embedded multiple crews in fans' homes, Chicago bars and even a Wrigleyville fire station to capture the moments as they unfolded. In addition, SCC shot footage at multiple games at Wrigley Field, and also pulled video from network broadcasts, Cubs' video partner Banner Collective, and Cubs' in-house video resources. After launching on social media at 5:00 a.m. Thursday morning, the spot was viewed millions of times within a few hours. Its reach was extended dramatically as it was picked up as a news story and played nationally on the Today Show, ESPN and on broadcast media around the country.  "The Chicago Cubs are a great American story," said SCC Managing Partner, Jim Stadler. "It goes way beyond Chicago. The Cubs are a global brand at this point and winning it all this year is a source of joy and inspiration for millions of people." SCC's work on for the Cubs also included the World Series Parade and celebration in Chicago. "Sleep is going to have to wait," said Molly Gilles, SCC Senior Account Executive. "But this is all so exciting, you want to soak up every minute of it." "We began this journey with the Cubs four seasons ago," said Michael Dorich, SCC Creative Director. "We've been bleeding Cubby blue every day working with this great team and absolutely loving it. To have the Cubs bring home a World Series Championship is more than we could ask for - we couldn't be more proud." About Schafer Condon Carter Schafer Condon Carter (SCC) is an independent integrated creative agency that delivers seamless brand content across an infinite set of consumer touch points for its clients. SCC clients include Allen Edmonds, the Chicago Cubs, Johnson & Johnson, National Pork Board, Procter & Gamble and Pepsico among others.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Pigging Company HPS Appoints VP Technology Solutions Pigging Company HPS Appoints VP Technology Solutions Posted on November 4, 2016 by Top News US Full Feed in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer New Role Will Support Continued Expansion in the US Nottingham, UK (PRWEB UK) 4 November 2016 HPS Product Recovery Solutions, the leading global specialist in liquid product recovery (pigging) and transfer systems, has appointed Dennis Stewart as VP Technology Solutions in the US. The company, which delivers best-in-class pigging technology to food, beverage, homecare, cosmetics, paint and other industries which process liquids, introduced the new position to increase sustainable, strategic growth and development throughout the region. Growing US Customer Base HPS selected Dennis after an in-depth, systematic and rigorous selection procedure. With over 15 years’ experience in process automation, Dennis’s skills perfectly complement their existing expertise. In addition, HPS previously employed Dennis in the early days of the business, so he already has a detailed understanding of the company’s technology. Gilbert Murphy, CEO of HPS commented, “Dennis is an outstanding engineer with extremely valuable experience in process automation. An increasing number of companies which process or pump liquids are deploying our systems to reduce waste, increase efficiency and environmental sustainability. Dennis will help us continue to provide high quality solutions to our growing US customer base.” Bright Future Since it started in 1995, HPS has developed a market-leading position in liquid product recovery, liquid transfer and automation. Dennis is looking forward to helping with the continued growth and development of the company in the US. Dennis commented, “I’m really excited to be back. With the best technology in the industry and a great team of people, HPS has a bright future. The company has almost quadrupled in size since I was last with them a few years ago. There’s real momentum in the business.” Problem Solving Technology Sustainability, waste reduction and increasing profitability are high on the agenda of most companies. HPS’s pigging technology helps companies towards their financial, operational and sustainability goals by recovering residual liquids from pipelines. So rather than flushing these useable liquids away, HPS customers can sell or further process them in the usual way. At the same time, the systems speed up processing and cut back on water and chemical usage. This results in high return on investment for HPS clients. Dennis concluded, “I really enjoy delivering value to businesses by solving their problems, and being at HPS enables me to excel at this. One of the things I’m most looking forward to is catching up with many long-standing customers, as well as new clients.” About HPS Founded in 1995, HPS Product Recovery Solutions increases its customers’ profitability by maximising product yields, reducing waste, increasing sustainability and improving efficiency. This is achieved through customised liquid distribution, transfer and product recovery (pigging) solutions. With a wide range of customers throughout the world, HPS has successfully installed more than 1,200 solutions. These include projects for multinational corporations such as Unilever, P&G, Akzo Nobel, Boots, The Coca Cola Company, Campbells Soups, Benjamin Moor, Nestle Purina, Mars, Kraft Foods, as well as many smaller independent businesses. The company’s key markets are the food and drink, cosmetics and personal care, household products, chemicals, paint and pet food processing industries. HPS operates worldwide with a network of regional offices and partners. More information is on the HPS website at http://www.HPS-Pigging.com/about-hps/.
