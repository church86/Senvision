Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Oct 15, 2016 at 8:28AM Image source: Getty Images. The smartest investors in the world aren't wrong. Dividend investing works, which is fantastic news for investors of all ages and incomes who are saving for retirement. However, constructing a portfolio of the best dividend stocks on the market doesn't happen on its own. So how can you find, buy, and grow your wealth with the top dividend stocks on the market today? Constructing a portfolio of great dividend stocks requires understanding a few key characteristics, including a stock's current dividend yield, dividend growth track record, payout ratio, and more. Dividend investing overview Successful dividend investing isn't necessarily about identifying any single characteristic in a stock. Rather, investors should focus on finding stocks that consistently grow cash distributions in a sustainable way over the long term, and reinvesting those payments. Finding such stocks with a high dividend yield can create a potent compounding machine that has been proven to outperform the market if consistently applied over the long term.  The table below shows five of the top dividend stocks on the market today, which I define as companies with dividend yields over 3% -- about 50% higher than the S&P 500's yield -- and track records of more than 25 years of consecutive annual dividend increases:  Company Name Dividend Yield No. Consecutive Annual Dividend Increases Procter & Gamble 3.0% 59 years Consolidated Edison 3.6% 41 years Coca-Cola Company 3.3% 53 years T. Rowe Price 3.2% 29 years McDonald's 3.0% 39 years Data sources: Dividend.com and Google Finance. However, this only speaks to a few of the most important aspects in selecting the best dividend stocks for your portfolio, so let's dive deeper into a few of the dividend stocks that seem particularly compelling for investors today. Image source: Getty Images. Procter & Gamble's track record of dividend excellence Few companies have established a more impressive dividend history than Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Before delving further into why long-term dividend investors love P&G, here are its three most crucial dividend statistics: Company Name Dividend Yield Years of Consecutive Increases Payout Ratio Procter & Gamble 3.0% 59 76% Data sources: Dividend.com and Yahoo! Finance.  Even if you don't realize it, chances are you encounter at least one brand owned by Procter & Gamble on a daily basis. The company owns 66 consumer products spread across consumer staples categories including home cleaning, laundry, and personal care products. Even more impressive, 22 of P&G's brands each contributed more than $1 billion in sales to the company in 2015.  The company's products tend to enjoy fairly stable demand regardless of the current health of the economy, which is a major reason Procter & Gamble has produced such a steady history of increasing dividend payments. The company has faced headwinds, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in recent years. But it has moved aggressively to cut costs and reinvest those savings into new organic growth initiatives. Analysts are now calling for the green shoots from P&G's turnaround efforts to begin to manifest themselves in coming quarters. Either way, though, a company with P&G's staying power makes it one of the best opportunities for long-term dividend investors on the market today. Image source: Getty Images. T. Rowe Price: a low-profile dividend giant Mutual fund management T. Rowe Price's (NASDAQ:TROW) offers a rock-solid dividend, as you can see below: Company Name Dividend Yield Years of Consecutive Increases Payout Ratio T. Rowe Price 3.2% 29 51% Data sources: Dividend.com and Yahoo! Finance.  With $777 billion in assets under management (AUM), T. Rowe Price remains one of the best asset managers in the world. An impressive 80% of T. Rowe Price's mutual funds beat their 1- and 3-year Lipper Averages, a popular performance benchmark for mutual funds, at the end of last calendar year, an accomplishment that helped earn T. Rowe Price the No. 4 ranking on Barron's Top Mutual Fund Families list this year.  Performances like this should help T. Rowe attract new customers over the long term, though the company's quarter-to-quarter performance tends to fluctuate with the stock market for a few reasons. T. Rowe Price generates its revenue from the fees it collects from the various funds it manages. Bull markets bring fat times for T. Rowe as rising asset prices increase its AUM and, thus, the fees it collects. However, uncertain markets or bear markets can have the opposite effect, which we've seen with recent T. Rowe Price earnings reports, though it remains worth noting that the stock market's long-run direction favors growth. Either way, T. Rowe Price manages its business with the utmost conservatism -- it carries zero long-term debt on its balance sheet -- which leaves the company ample cash flow to return to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. Over the past two years, T. Rowe Price has reduced its shares outstanding by nearly 5%. What's more, the company's demonstrated commitment to growing its annual dividend payments makes it another fantastic option for investors interested in building an exceptional long-term dividend portfolio.

By Tareq Haddad October 16, 2016 17:39 BST Hair firm GHD to be bought out by American cosmetics giant Coty, Sky News reportsGetty US beauty giant Coty is reportedly buying out British hair products firm GHD, Sky Sports has claimed. The New York-based company has more than 70 high-end brands to its name – such as Calvin Klein, Clairol, Marc Jacobs, Rimmel and Wella – and is "close to sealing" the takeover of GHD, the outlet has said. Anonymous banking sources confirmed the deal could be announced this month. One unsuccessful bidder told Sky that the deal could be "well in excess of £400m ($487m, €444m). The report comes three months after Coty purchased three divisions of Proctor and Gamble's company for $12bn (£7.7bn, €10.7bn at the time of purchase). P&G's hair care, fragrance and cosmetics businesses were auctioned off after the company was looking to sell several non-core assets as part of a cost-cutting strategy. The acquisition made Coty one of the world's biggest beauty groups. However, the firm appears to have not stopped its sights there with its reported plans for GHD. Sky understands Coty saw off rival bids from CVC Capital Partners and Panasonic. GHD was put up for sale earlier this year by its owner, the private equity firm Lion Capital, with Rothschild hired to handle the auction. The company manufactures a wide range of straighteners, curling products and hairdryers, and is understood to boast a strong innovation pipeline, developed with the aid of new technologies. In the UK, GHD products are sold in upmarket outlets such as Harvey Nichols and Selfridges, with the company keen to expand its international reach by growing sales in countries such as Brazil, China, India and South Korea. According to Sky, documents sent to prospective buyers disclosed that it made £33.7m ($41.1m, €37.4m) in pre-tax profit in its 2015-16 financial year, on sales up 9.5% to £181.2m ($220.8m, €201.3m). The firm has been run by Anthony Davey, a former P&G executive, since 2014.

Sky News has learnt that Coty, which has just completed the $12.5bn purchase of Procter & Gamble's specialist beauty business, is in advanced talks to buy GHD. Banking sources said that a deal could be announced as soon as this month. If completed, the transaction will unite products bearing the names of one of Britain's most famous celebrity couples: the consumer beauty division of Coty's existing portfolio includes products bearing David Beckham's name, while his wife Victoria's fashion business has a tie-up with GHD. The exact price that City intends to pay for GHD was unclear this weekend, although one unsuccessful bidder said it was likely to be well in excess of £400m. GHD was put up for sale earlier this year by its owner, the private equity firm Lion Capital, with Rothschild hired to handle an auction. A number of cross-border deals have been struck since the fall in sterling since June's EU referendum, allowing overseas bidders to take advantage of cheaper takeover targets, although it is unclear whether that has been a material factor for Coty. The US-based cosmetics group, which is chaired by Bart Becht, the former chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser, is understood to have seen off competition for GHD from rival bidders CVC Capital Partners and Panasonic. Coty's other brands include CoverGirl, Davidoff and Clairol, and following the acquisition of the P&G; division it is now one of the world's largest beauty, cosmetics and fragrances groups. GHD, whose name stands for Good Hair Day, has shown strong growth, with documents sent to prospective buyers disclosing that it made £33.7m in pre-tax profit in its 2015-16 financial year, on sales up 9.5% to £181.2m. The company manufactures a wide range of straighteners, curling products and hairdryers, and is understood to boast a strong innovation pipeline, developed with the aid of new technologies. It was founded in 2001 with a £15,000 investment from three entrepreneurs in Bradford, West Yorkshire, who bought the rights to a Korean-developed hair-straightening iron. The company now has an alliance with Mrs Beckham's fashion business, and leans heavily on a range of celebrity endorsements to promote itself. In the UK, GHD products are sold in upmarket outlets such as Harvey Nichols and Selfridges, with the company keen to expand its international reach by growing sales in countries such as Brazil, China, India and South Korea. GHD has been run since 2014 by Anthony Davey, a former P&G; executive. The company's rival, Tangle Teezer, is also exploring a sale and is understood to be in exclusive talks with Inflexion Private Equity. Lion Capital declined to comment, while Coty could not be reached for comment.

He first encountered them at a friend's house on the back of the toilet, and decided to give them a try. “It’s just a totally different feeling,” he says. “You see what you were leaving behind.” When he moved into an apartment in Chicago with his three best friends after college, Riley stocked wet wipes in the bathroom. It didn’t take long for the guys to have what he calls “the conversation”: They all admitted they were addicted. Once they felt that moist rub, they couldn’t turn back to the brittle chafe of toilet paper. They made a trip to Sam’s Club together to buy wet wipes in bulk. Then they had a second conversation. What if they started a business? What if they created a wet wipe that young men, like themselves, could purchase without feeling embarrassed? “That was when we started looking at the market,” Riley says. “Where is the flushable wipes market at right now? Where is it going?” Dude Wipes was born. The company is a rising star in the flushable wet-wipe world, a multi-billion-dollar industry that took off in the mid-2000s, when companies like Kimberly-Clark and Proctor & Gamble repackaged traditional baby wipes as luxurious adult toilet paper, pre-soaked and cut-down small enough to flush down a toilet. In 2015, personal wet-wipe sales reached an estimated $2.2 billion. Dude Wipes has made a name for itself by using clever and humorous marketing. The company posts a never-ending stream of potty-themed jokes on social media, such as the faux-launch of a limited-edition Pumpkin Spice scent. Riley, now 31, refers to himself as the “Chief Executive Dude.” Collectively, the owners call themselves “the AmbASSadors.” Riley believes that his friends’ camaraderie and sense of humor give Dude Wipes its competitive edge. People seem to agree. In 2013, Dude Wipes won the Nonwovens Industry Visionary Award, an industry-wide honor for the year’s most exciting new product. In 2015, after the AmbASSadors appeared on TV show Shark Tank, the billionaire Mark Cuban became an investor and partner in the company. Dude Wipes is stocked at national chains like Kroger, Meijer, and Target. < PREVIOUS SLIDESLIDE 1 of 5NEXT SLIDE > A package of Dude Wipes (Courtesy of Frank Dick, city of Vancouver) © Provided by Atlantic Media Company But lawsuits are now popping up across the country over use of the word “flushable.” Sewerage authorities claim that flushable wet wipes don’t break apart, and, as a result, are destroying municipal sewer systems. The wipes cluster with congealed food fat to form large blockages known as fatberg—a portmanteau of fat and iceberg. Last year, a 10-ton lump was removed from the London sewer system at a cost of £400,000. Cases have also been reported in Newcastle, Sydney,San Francisco, Miami, New York City, Toronto, and Washington, D.C. In 2015, the Federal Trade Commission pulled a wet wipe by the brand Nice-Pak off the market. Sewerage authorities hope that more regulation is imminent. Dude Wipes, for its part, claims that its wipes are biodegradable and have been tested by “scientist and doctor dudes.” Are those claims true? Can wet wipes be stopped? Or must cities resign themselves to a future of fatberg? * * * Wyoming, Minnesota, is one of the first American cities to take on the flushable-wet-wipe industry. In 2015, the city filed a class-action suit against Proctor & Gamble, Kimberley-Clark, Nice-Pak, and three other wet wipe manufacturers for fraudulently promoting their products as flushable. Dave Torma, a public-works employee in Wyoming, says that the problem picked up in the early 2000s and has gotten worse over the years. After wet wipes are flushed, they exit a house through a lateral pipe that connects to a public sewer system, where sewage pumps ensure that the wastewater flows in the correct direction. But unlike toilet paper, wet wipes fail to disintegrate. They clog the pumps, causing them to break down and redirect stagnant wastewater back toward houses. Sewer systems must be shut down so that the wipes can be manually removed. When the four-foot pumps are lifted for maintenance, “it looks like you’re pulling up Cousin It,” Torma says. In 2008, the industry standard for use of the word “flushable” for wet wipes and other nonwoven products was created by the North American trade organization the Association of Nonwoven Fabric Industries, also known as INDA. As of 2013, to be labeled “flushable,” a wet wipe must pass seven tests that evaluate its ability to disintegrate, biodegrade, and clear household and municipal sewer lines. But there is no penalty or fine if a wet-wipe manufacturer doesn’t comply. The industry is self-regulated, without government oversight. According to the City of Wyoming, INDA’s seven “flushability” tests fail to simulate real-life conditions in a sewer system. One test, the “slosh box” disintegration test, for example, places a wipe in a tank filled with two liters of water that rocks back and forth for 3 hours. The fibers that remain must then be able to pass through a 12.5-millimeter sieve. But a wet wipe often reaches a sewage pump in a couple of minutes, wastewater officials argue. And many sewer systems are not nearly as hard on the wipe as the agitation test. In 2013, Consumer Reports conducted an independent agitation test that none of the leading four wet wipes (Charmin, Scott, Cottonelle, and Equate) could pass. The wipes also failed to break apart after being beaten for 10 minutes in a kitchen stand mixer on the lowest speed. Dave Rousse, the president of INDA, claims that the flushability tests are satisfactory and that the industry sufficiently regulates itself. He says that INDA calls companies whose wipes don’t pass the seven tests and informs them that their product can no longer be labeled flushable. While he sympathizes with Wyoming’s sewage maintenance problem, he considers their lawsuit “misguided.” Their problem, he contends, is caused by consumers flushing baby wipes—which, unlike the new wave of adult wet wipes, are still meant to be thrown in the garbage—and other non-flushable products like tampons, dental floss, and condoms. In July, Proctor & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark, Nice-Pak, and the three other wet wipe manufactures named in the suit requested that the City of Wyoming save and archive all of its clogged sewage for 180 days to be used as evidence. This would amount to collecting and storing hundreds of tons of raw sewage. Last week, the judge ruled that Wyoming must collect, photograph, and videotape a third of all its sewage clogs over the 180-day span, but that it could dispose of the sewage after 7 days. * * * Wyoming is not alone; sewerage authorities across the country are frustrated with INDA’s flushable standard. In 2012, wastewater associations like the Water Environment Federation tried to work with INDA to establish a new, more rigorous standard, but INDA didn’t show a working draft to them until two weeks before publication at the World of Wipes conference in 2013. The sewerage authorities were dismayed to find that the pass/fail criteria was two to three times more lenient than it had been in the previous guidelines, published in 2009. “It’s become clear that the manufacturers are not the people that should be telling us what is acceptable and not acceptable in our sewer systems,” says Rob Villee, the executive director of the Plainfield Area Regional Sewerage Authority, in New Jersey. Villee estimates that wet wipes are costing billions of dollars a year in worldwide maintenance. “This is an international problem,” he says. “This isn’t the United States, this isn’t Canada. It’s England. It’s Spain. It’s Australia. It’s Israel, France.” The international wastewater community, which consists of 15 countries, including the Netherlands, Turkey, Belgium, France, and the United Kingdom, has given up on working with INDA and its European counterpart, EDANA. These countries started working together in 2015, when the International Standards Organization (ISO), a non-government market agency, decided to create an international standard for “flushable.” They were afraid that if they did not band together, INDA and EDANA would once again dictate the terms. The presidents of the various associations email regularly and speak on weekly conference calls. In September, British environmental groups and waste companies publicly condemned wet wipes. Wessex Water, a sewerage company that serves Southwest England, led the charge, reporting that of the 13,000 blockages they unclog every year, two-thirds are caused by wet wipes. They were also the first to publish a newly agreed-upon International Wastewater Position Statement, which calls for a ban on commercial use of the word “flushable.” The Position Statement advocates that only the “3Ps”—pee, poo, and toilet paper—be flushed. Wastewater authorities from the other 15 countries officially signed on.  “Part of the picture, is assessing the environmental concern and weighing it against the societal benefit.” The international wastewater community is now trying to hash out its own flushable standard, with the hope that ISO will adopt it as the international market standard and that the Federal Trade Commission will adopt it as a Green Guide flushable rule. Green Guide rules allow the government to regulate and fine companies for misleading consumers about environmental claims. (The FTC declined to comment on any policy-related questions or to discuss if the wet-wipe industry is currently under review.) * * * Preventing wet wipes from blocking sewers is just one part of the wet-wipe problem.  The wipes also might pose environmental risks, because they’re made from plastics and synthetic cellulosic fibers, some of which are non-degradable. Once flushed, these plastics disintegrate into microplastics, a type of debris that is smaller than five millimeters in length. The particles cluster in aquatic environments with microplastics from other consumer products, such as some cleansers, exfoliants, and toothpastes. Richard Thompson, a marine biology professor and a director of the International Marine Litter Research Unit, believes that wet-wipe microplastics essentially behave like all other microplastics, which have been proven to transport chemicals to wildlife and to harm marine invertebrates. They have also contributed to such environmental disasters as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. “Part of the picture, is assessing the environmental concern and weighing it against the societal benefit,” he says. House paint, for example, contains lead, which poses an environmental concern. But house paint stays on a house for years, whereas a wet wipe is discarded right after use. “To me, [wet wipes are] away from what I’d consider the center-stage direction for responsible use of plastics in society as we go forward,” Thompson says. Not much is currently known about the environmental effects of synthetic cellulosic fibers. Each wet-wipe product is made from a different combination of them, and they all biodegrade at different speeds and have different rates of emission. It will take some time to test all of the various synthetic fibers, and assess how many non-degradable particles they contribute to the aquatic environment. As a conservative position, the wastewater industry does not believe synthetic fibers should be used until more is known. The International Wastewater Position Statement, meanwhile, claims that no product made from plastics or regenerated cellulose should ever be flushed down the toilet. Last August, Dude Wipes failed to pass a field test conducted by the city of Vancouver, Washington. Fourteen different brands of flushable wet wipes were labeled, soaked for a half-hour, then flushed down an 8-inch sewer line. The wastewater engineering team retrieved the Dude Wipes in the city sewer system 3330 feet away from the drop point, along with seven other brands, fully intact. Villee, the Plainfield sewerage authority director, has personally tested Dude Wipes, as well. “They’re not the worst product,” he says. “I’d probably say they’re kind of in the middle of the pack somewhere.” And are they biodegradable? “They are, under certain conditions and temperatures, [but] I don’t think those are the conditions and temperatures that they’re exposed to in the wastewater system,” Villee says. He calls this the “disingenuous part” of the biodegradable label. “Yeah, they’re biodegradable, but when? Ten years from now?”   * * * Last month, Dude Wipes released a new version of its flushable wet wipe, which, according to Riley, now is 100 percent biodegradable and free of microplastics. (The company gets its scientific information from INDA president Rousse, independent consultants, and the science and doctor dudes who work at the product’s manufacturing plant.) Riley scoffs at the notion that the INDA standard is too industry-friendly. He says that a Dude Wipe product once failed INDA’s flushability test, and the AmbASSadors worked hard to ensure that it eventually passed. He couldn’t comment as to why the Dude Wipes failed the Vancouver Field Test, but he is skeptical of non-industry testing. “If you’re not running [the test] with a certified iso-lab, and certain specifications, it gets kind of hard to speak on,” he says. Riley also resists any FTC-enforced definition of flushable. “I don’t necessarily think it’s the worst idea in the world,” he says. “But I’m sure they’d just be working with the industry. The industry would end up creating it anyway. They would just hold the government’s hand the whole time.” The way he sees it, growing pains are to be expected. “The technology can obviously and already arguably is on the same pace as toilet paper,” Riley says. “Who’s to say the technology isn’t going to surpass toilet paper some day and cut down on paper waste altogether?” The Dudes are hard at work on a top-secret video that they hope to release on Black Friday. Riley wouldn’t share many of the details, but he did mention that it will feature “real-life funny scenarios that can happen to any guy.” The goal, he says, is to “show why using Dude Wipes is better than toilet paper.” That, and “to make tons of people laugh across the country about the topic of wiping your ass.” Go to MSN Home More in Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times 7 things you should never do online USA TODAY The world's most valuable stamps Lovemoney 6 Social Security changes coming in 2017 U.S. News & World Report - Money Up Next 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from The Atlantic ‘I Voted for the Wrecking Ball’: Your Pushback The Atlantic Clinton's Popular-Vote Lead Will Grow, and Grow, and Grow The Atlantic Track of the Day: ‘Jimmie Rodgers' Dream’ by Leon Russell and Elton John The Atlantic The Iconic Hillary Clinton The Atlantic The Atlantic View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

Credit Photograph by Brian Babineau / NBAE via Getty Last month, as an increasing number of professional athletes followed the lead of Colin Kaepernick, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback, by sitting or kneeling during the national anthem, the National Basketball Association and the National Basketball Players Association together issued a memo to the league’s players, soliciting ideas for creating “positive change.” The memo informed players that the league and the union were working together to formulate their own suggestions. “These ideas are based on the actions many of you have already taken or supported,” the memo read, “including convening community conversations in NBA markets to engage young people, parents, community leaders and law enforcement in a candid dialogue.” A few days before the memo went out, I spoke with Mark Tatum, the N.B.A.’s deputy commissioner and chief operating officer, about how the league was preparing for the upcoming season, given the wave of political protests in the sports world. The N.B.A., he said, would not only support players in expressing their views but also work to further the discussion. “The conversations are really about moving beyond symbolic gestures and moving towards real action,” Tatum told me, sitting in his Manhattan office. “What are the things we can do in our community to make a difference, and to continue the conversation in making a difference?” As the No. 2 man in the league office, under the commissioner, Adam Silver, Tatum has maintained a low profile. (If N.B.A. fans recognize him at all, it’s as the guy who takes over for Silver at the podium on draft night when the second round begins.) But he has played an influential role in shaping the league’s message over the years. He has a large portfolio of responsibilities, overseeing global partnerships, marketing, and communications, as well as team marketing and business operations. In addition to being one of the N.B.A.’s key decision-makers, he is also, as the son of a Caymanian father and Chinese mother, the highest-ranking executive of color in a major American sports league. Tatum grew up in East Flatbush, a predominantly African-American and Caribbean neighborhood in Brooklyn. His parents met while his father, Charlie, who grew up in Jamaica and immigrated to the U.S. at eighteen years old, was serving in Vietnam as a member of the United States Air Force. As a kid, Tatum was often reminded of how different he was from everyone, a divide that grew when he attended a mostly white junior high school in Bensonhurst. Later, though, at the more diverse Brooklyn Technical High School, Tatum came to celebrate difference. “I’ve always had this appreciation of different cultures, different races, and the importance of bridging that and understanding different points of views and perspectives,” Tatum said. “That’s helped color my thinking as I’ve grown up throughout life.” Tatum also has an appreciation for how to craft an appealing message for a broad swath of consumers. Following high school, he went to Cornell; once he had decided that being pre-med was a mistake, he turned to business management and marketing. After graduation, he went to work for Procter & Gamble and the Clorox Company, before landing a job in the sports-marketing division of PepsiCo. He returned to school to get an M.B.A. from Harvard, and the year he finished that degree he took a job in corporate sponsorship and marketing at Major League Baseball. One year later, David Stern, then the N.B.A. commissioner, hired him away, making him the N.B.A.’s director of marketing and media. In 2015, Richard Lapchick, the director of the Institute of Diversity and Ethics in Sport, gave the N.B.A. an A-plus for racial hiring practices and a B-plus for gender-related hiring practices, the highest marks of any sports league. “It’s a wonderful feeling to be at a place where you are valued for bringing different ideas,” Tatum said. “We recognize having diverse points of views makes us better.” But when players express their diverse points of view on controversial topics, leagues often struggle with how best to respond. Twenty years ago, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, a guard for the Denver Nuggets, declined to stand for the national anthem, and he was suspended indefinitely by the N.B.A. The league relented after one game, when Abdul-Rauf agreed to stand for the anthem on the condition that he be allowed to bow his head in prayer. “I think the world has changed in the last twenty years,” Tatum said, when I asked him about that precedent. In July, the Women’s National Basketball Association, which is backed by the N.B.A., fined players on three teams and their organizations for wearing black T-shirts during pregame warmups to protest recent shootings by, and violence perpetrated against, police officers. After a social-media backlash, the W.N.B.A. rescinded the fines. Commissioner Silver expressed support for the women, while adding that he wanted all players to adhere to their leagues’ uniform rules. “I would greatly prefer that the players use the platform they’re given,” Silver said at a meeting of the board of governors in July. “Social media, press conferences, media in locker rooms, however they want to do it, to make their political points of view be known.” That incident seems to have informed the approach the N.B.A. is taking now. That approach is also doubtless informed by the makeup of the league itself: Lapchick estimates that, in 2015, nearly three-quarters of N.B.A. players were African-American, and a number of those players have experienced not only racism but police brutality and gun violence. Last year, Thabo Sefolosha, the Atlanta Hawks forward, suffered a broken right fibula in an altercation with police officers outside a New York night club. (In April, he filed a lawsuit against five New York police officers for false arrest and use of excessive force.) In August, Nykea Aldridge, the first cousin of Dwyane Wade, the Chicago Bulls guard and perennial All-Star, was shot and killed in Chicago, after two men fired at a third man and struck her instead. This was six weeks after Wade joined LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Paul onstage at the ESPY Awards to urge fellow-athletes to become more active in their communities. After the ESPYs, Anthony organized a town-hall event with officers from the Los Angeles Police Department, community leaders, and African-American and Latino teen-agers. Tatum pointed to Anthony’s event specifically when discussing the league’s encouragement of social involvement. “They are some of the most prominent African-American athletes in our country and in our world,” Tatum noted. “They have the ability to influence positive action through their own individual and collective actions.” As the preseason has gotten under way, multiple teams have fashioned a new approach to the national anthem that acknowledges recent protests while presenting a less confrontational image: players on the New York Knicks, Toronto Raptors, and Houston Rockets all locked arms during the anthem, in displays of unity. The Boston Celtics held hands, calling for “unity, progress and love.” The Milwaukee Bucks stood together in a line during the national anthem at a recent preseason game, putting their arms around one another. “We’re not protesting,” Jason Kidd, the head coach of the Bucks, told reporters. “We’re showing unity. There’s not a protest.” Alex Wong is a writer in New York.

From dandruff to dehydration, it's time to pay close attention to your hair parting 07:00, 16 Oct 2016 Updated 10:35, 18 Oct 2016 By Lynne Hyland Scalp is skin! So start treating it that way. Discover how a peep at your parting could help you get healthier, happier, more beautiful hair…   Share   Comments Get celebs news by email Catherine Harbour It's important to look after your scalp as well as your hair Pity our poor, neglected scalp – it really is a case of ‘out of sight, out of mind’. While we happily lavish time, money and care on our hair, there’s scarcely any attention paid to what lies beneath. Astonishingly, a recent survey* discovered half of women in the UK don’t even think of their scalp as skin. However we’re doing ourselves a huge disservice. "Healthy hair starts with a healthy scalp," says Kathy Rogerson, from P&G scientific communications. "Your scalp ages just as your face does, and having scalp problems will only add to the natural decline in hair quality as you get older." Even just scratching your head can damage your hair follicles. The D-word (c) The Power of Forever Photography Tackle dandruff straight away While it’s embarrassing to have flakes on your shoulders, dandruff isn’t just a cosmetic issue. New research has found that dandruff causes free radical damage to the scalp, which affects the quality of the hair. "Hair is likely to be weaker as it emerges and prone to breakage," says Kathy. The problem can get worse the longer it’s left. "Untreated dandruff can turn into seborrhoeic dermatitis, a thick, stuck-on yellow scale," says trichologist Sally-Ann Tarver . "It makes the scalp sore, and can even cause hair loss." Dandruff is caused by a fungal yeast we all have on our scalp, which feeds on the skin’s natural oils. If you’re dandruff prone, this leads to irritation, which makes the cells clump together. Result: flakes. The first step is to use a dedicated anti-dandruff shampoo. "This reduces the yeast and helps exfoliate and break down the scale,’" says Sally-Ann. "But if the scale is thick, you might need a professional descaling treatment. It’s also important to wash frequently to keep the yeast under control. It’s a myth hair is self-cleansing, you’ll just get a build-up of the oil the yeast feeds on." Is it dandruff or dehydration? Just to confuse things, itching, tightness and flaking can also be caused by a dry scalp, rather than dandruff. "I’d say if you’re not seeing a benefit from medicated shampoo in a few weeks, the problem is more likely to be dryness," says Sally-Ann. "A dry scalp is largely down to the body being dehydrated, and the biggest answer is simply to drink lots of water." She also recommends deep-moisturising your scalp by applying coconut oil overnight. There's the rub... Getty Try a scalp massage Dry scalp massage can help stimulate growth, but you have to do it properly says Sally-Ann. "Don’t slide your fingers round in circles – you can physically rub the hair away. I’ve seen people who’ve given themselves friction alopecia this way. You need to move just your scalp with your fingertips, not your hair." Adding a few drops of almond or sesame seed oil is also great for moisturising the scalp, even if you don’t have a specific scalp issue. Product watch Product build-up can aggravate the scalp, says Sally-Ann. "A lot of styling products are full of plastics and alcohol, which is fine on hair, but potentially irritating to skin. If your scalp is dehydrated, it absorbs more of what you put on it, which can make dryness worse." Her advice? Keep styling products on the hair, rather than letting them go to your head. Model behaviour Our model (above) is none other than Britain’s Next Top Model winner Chloe Keenan (and we can confirm she has a very lovely, non-flaky scalp). My hair is always being styled sprayed with products. Luckily, I don’t have dandruff, but I was given the Head & Shoulders range, as they’re the official BNTM partners, and I’ve carried on using them ever since. The Smooth & Silky range is great – it gets rid of product build-up and keeps my hair in good condition. Scalp savers ● Head & Shoulders 3Action Formula Shampoo and Conditioner Smooth & Silky, from £2.99 Fight those flakes A new skincare-inspired ‘cleanse, protect and moisturise’ tech that’s now in the whole H&S range. They’ve worked out a way to shrink the anti-dandruff actives, so they can get deeper into the follicles – so no place for yeast to hide. Having tiny particles also means your hair is left super-soft and smooth, so there’s no trade-off between scalp health and lovely locks. ● Kérastase DermoCalm scalp soother, £17.90 Soothe soreness In two versions for dry and combination hair, this is designed to calm dry, sensitive scalps. There’s also a new Scalp Purification salon treatment, from £85, which involves a detoxing clay mask and deep exfoliation using a sonic cleanser. ● Wet Brush Pro Sugar Skull, £12.99 Be kind to tangles Rigid brushes can be too hard or scratchy on delicate scalps (also chuck out any brush that’s lost its protective ‘bobbles’ as it’ll rip into your skin). The ultra-flexy Wet Brush is soft on scalps and tangly hair, and we love this month’s new Fright Night designs. ● Plantur 39 Phyto-Caffeine Tonic, £9.99 Encourages hair growth This leave-in scalp tonic is designed for women 40+ worried about thinning hair. Caffeine wakes up ageing hair follicles, which in turn helps reduce hair fall-out. *Head & Shoulders global survey on scalp health Sally-Ann Tarver is at the Cotswold Trichology Centre .

Trump said Buffett, the chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., “took a massive deduction,” which prompted Buffett to issue a press release the next day saying he hadn’t. Since then, tax policy has been getting a thorough discussion, with partisan viewpoints ruling many of the comments. Marty Davis, CEO of Cambria Holdings and Sun Country Airlines, said on talk show host Laura Ingraham’s program, broadcast on Omaha’s KOIL radio station, among others, that Buffett is a tax avoider because he donates untaxed stock gains to charities, does not pay taxable dividends to shareholders and plans to leave almost his entire estate to nonprofit foundations. It’s fine to use legal tax policy to reduce your taxes, Davis said, but then you can’t brag about how much tax you pay, while arguing that rich people should pay more taxes. When Berkshire buys a company, Davis said, any taxable dividend that company had been paying goes directly to Berkshire and is no longer subject to taxes. Although I’m not a tax expert, it seems to me that any money that goes to Berkshire — whether it’s profits from Geico or the price of a Dilly Bar — contributes to Berkshire’s profits and is taxable. Berkshire paid $10.5 billion in income taxes last year. Forbes magazine ranked Berkshire as the eighth-largest corporate taxpayer in the country. Next month we’ll find out if Berkshire is on track for another year of $20 billion-plus in taxable profits. Washington Post columnist Allan Sloan, who has criticized Trump’s business practices in earlier columns, estimated that Berkshire avoided $2.5 billion in capital gains taxes through complicated “cash-rich split-off” transactions involving Phillips 66, the Post and Procter & Gamble. The IRS treated the transaction as tax-free trades rather than sales, and they’re not illegal or unethical, Sloan wrote. While Buffett’s personal tax practices “qualify him for sainthood,” Sloan wrote, “Buffett the CEO’s tax practices qualify him … to be a CEO, trying to maximize profits for his shareholders. “His behavior is much better than Trump’s, because Berkshire is highly profitable and pays substantial income taxes. But Buffett the CEO is no saint — and it’s a mistake to think of him as one.” In Forbes magazine, tax CPA Peter J. Reilly wrote that Buffett’s 2015 charitable contributions, $2.85 billion, far exceed the allowable charitable deductions he could take for hundreds of years, even if the law didn’t say that type of deduction expires after five years. Those who make charitable contributions certainly think about deductions but also want their money to accomplish something. The wise use of charitable money can ease the burden on taxpayers by doing things that the government can’t or won’t. Expanding in the food industry? Berkshire’s sale of its minority interest in Wrigley to Mars Inc. could mean job cuts for the chewing gum company while freeing up money for Buffett to invest in, for example, the food industry. That’s the view of analyst Dean Best, writing for industry website just-food.com. Eight years ago Berkshire put up $4.4 billion toward Mars’ $23 billion purchase of Wrigley and paid $2.1 billion for its share of Wrigley when the sale closed. This month Mars said it had bought Berkshire’s share of Wrigley and would integrate the two companies into Mars Wrigley Confectionery, with brands like Orbit gum and Snickers candy bars. The company said some jobs will go, especially at the senior leadership and management levels, Best wrote, emphasizing the goal is growth and not saving money. The combination “looks set to allow the privately owned business a greater ability to use its scale, making what is already the world’s largest candy maker an even more formidable competitor,” Best wrote. Buffett may be interested in expanding in the food industry, the story said, citing continuing speculation that a possible target is Mondelez International. Mondelez’s products include chocolates, gum, candy, beverages, cheese, grocery items and “biscuits,” which we would generally call cookies and crackers such as Oreo and Nabisco. Mondelez, based in Deerfield, Illinois, took that name in 2011 when Kraft Foods split into two companies. The grocery division ended up merging with H.J. Heinz as Kraft Heinz, now partly owned by Berkshire. Mondelez’s publicly traded stock is worth about $65 billion. Still not on the Harvard list Luckily, Buffett didn’t make the Harvard Business Review’s latest list of the 100 best-performing CEOs in the world. That would have broken a string of snubs that dates to 1950, when a Harvard admissions interviewer rejected Buffett’s application for graduate school. The school was looking for leaders, not financial geniuses, as biographer Alice Schroeder wrote. Buffett has joked that the Harvard alumni office may regret that decision these days. For this year’s rankings, the Review calculated the financial success of 895 CEOs from 32 countries over the past decade, plus the Environmental, Social and Governance performances of their companies, resulting in an ESG ranking by the Sustainalytics consulting firm. Last year Buffett also failed to make the list, and the Review noted that Berkshire’s meager ESG disclosures doomed his chances of a high total ranking. Annual reports of European business, especially, spend considerable space reporting on their companies’ social and environmental policies, while U.S. corporations tend to focus just on the money. No. 1 on this year’s list is Lars Robien Sorensen of the Danish health care firm Novo Nordisk. The only American in the top 10 was Jen Hsun Huang of Nvidia, a Santa Clara, California, computer graphics company. In an August round-table discussion with others on the list, Sorensen said: “To be honest, I think we’re highly overrated. At least in my business, success is far more of a team effort than the public would like to believe, especially in America.” Berkshire Hathaway Inc. owns the Omaha World-Herald. steve.jordon@owh.com, 402-444-1080, twitter.com/buffettOWH Find more of The World-Herald's coverage of Warren Buffett here.

When Warren Buffett disclosed information from his own personal tax returns and stomped Donald Trump so skillfully a few days ago, the stories just wrote themselves. Quotes in the article Phillips 66 PSX ▼ 82.22 -0.87 -1.05% Graham Holdings Co GHC ▲ 476.60 +8.00 +1.71% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 59.02 +0.32 +0.55% Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRK.B ▲ 156.92 +0.86 +0.55% Buffett, who has called early and often for tax increases on America’s biggest earners, punched out the tax-dodging Trump for saying during Sunday’s presidential debate that Buffett “took a massive tax deduction” and that he was dodging taxes the same way Trump was. Buffett emerged triumphant. However, if Trump had done some homework, he could have said that Buffett, like Trump himself, has pursued aggressive, money-saving tax strategies. Which, in fact, Buffett has. But Buffett has pursued these strategies not for himself, but for the company he runs: Berkshire Hathaway. In transactions in 2014 and last year, Berkshire did three “cash-rich split-off” transactions that allowed it to end up with lots of cash and assets while avoiding what I estimate to be a total of about $2.5 billion in capital gains taxes. Berkshire did what amounted to complicated trades with three companies whose shares it had owned for years, swapping those holdings for a combination of cash and operating assets. The transactions are treated by the IRS as tax-free trades, rather than sales. For example, Berkshire got $450 million in cash and a business valued at $900 million from Phillips 66 in return for its Phillips 66 shares, which were valued at $660 million in 2012 when ConocoPhillips (a stock Berkshire had bought in 2008) spun off Phillips 66 to Berkshire and its other shareholders. Berkshire did similar stock-for-cash-and-assets swaps with Graham Holdings (former owner of The Washington Post) and Procter & Gamble.© AP Photo/Seth Wenig That ground-breaking program in Colorado? Warren Buffett's family paid for that. By my count, the three transactions that yielded cash and assets were worth $6.2 billion more than Berkshire’s $1 billion total cost for its stock in the companies, which in the case of Graham Holdings dated back more than 40 years. At a combined state and federal tax rate of about 40 percent—there is no special capital gains rate for corporations—selling its holdings in those three companies for cash would have triggered a $2.5 billion tax bill. But because Berkshire (whose shareholders include me) swapped shares for cash and other assets in split-off transactions, it realized major gains but didn’t have to pay gains tax. I’ve previously written about these three transactions, as well as a fourth one that Berkshire did in 2008. I emailed Buffett’s assistant Thursday seeking comment but did not receive a response. I had tried to speak with Buffett about these deals last year, but he said wouldn’t talk with me because he didn’t like the way I had written about a different tax-aggressive transaction that Berkshire was involved in. To wit, that was the 2014 deal in which Berkshire helped Burger King desert to Canada for tax purposes by buying the Canadian-based Tim Horton restaurant chain. A trademark of Buffett’s tax-minimizing deals for Berkshire is buying new issues of preferred stock rather than common stock. That's what happened when General Electric, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs turned up on Buffett’s doorstep seeking both capital and Buffett’s imprimatur during and after the financial crisis. Dividends, you see, are partly tax-free for corporate recipients, even though they’re generally fully taxable for individuals. I’m not trying to imply that Berkshire’s transactions are either illegal or unethical. They’re not. The point I’m trying to make is that there’s a huge difference between the way Buffett the person handles his personal income taxes and the way Buffett the CEO handles Berkshire’s corporate income taxes. Buffett the person’s tax practices qualify him for sainthood, because among other things, his generous donations of Berkshire stock to charitable causes generate billions of dollars more in tax deductions than he will ever use. Buffett the CEO’s tax practices qualify him … to be a CEO, trying to maximize profits for his shareholders. His behavior is much better than Trump’s, because Berkshire is highly profitable and pays substantial income taxes. But Buffett the CEO is no saint — and it’s a mistake to think of him as one.

 UPDATE 1-Hershey CEO Bilbrey to retire in July, stay as non-exec chairman Reuters Oct. 14, 2016, 7:37 AM 2,486 facebook linkedin twitter email print (Updates with announcement) By Greg Roumeliotis and Lauren Hirsch Oct 13 (Reuters) - Hershey Co, the chocolate maker that Oreo cookie-maker Mondelez International Inc tried to buy earlier this year, said on Friday that Chief Executive John Bilbrey would retire from his post on July 1. Bilbrey will continue as non-executive chairman of the board following his retirement as president and CEO, Hershey said. The company said it had created a special committee to search for a new chief executive. Reuters reported exclusively on Thursday that Bilbrey was preparing to step down by next summer. The move comes less than three months after the charitable trust that controls Hershey reached a major reform agreement with its overseer, the Pennsylvania attorney general's office, raising questions about its future plans for the company. Bilbrey is stepping down to spend more time with his family, a person familiar with the matter had told Reuters. The company, which is based in the town of Hershey, Pennsylvania, has a market capitalization of around $20 billion. Bilbrey was named CEO of Hershey in 2011, after serving in various senior roles at the company since 2003. He added the position of chairman in 2015. Prior to Hershey, Bilbrey worked for 22 years at consumer company Procter & Gamble Co. Following an initial spurned bid in June, Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld re-approached Bilbrey in August, indicating that Mondelez would be willing to offer $115 a share, Reuters reported at the time. Hershey responded to that offer by stating it would not be willing to enter into deal negotiations for an offer of less than $125 per share, a source said at the time. The Hershey trust was set up by the company's founder over a century ago to fund and run a school for underprivileged children. It holds 81 percent of the company's voting stock, and so a sale is not possible without its approval. About two-thirds of its $12 billion in assets are in Hershey stock. Following a dispute with the Pennsylvania attorney general over its governance policy, the trust in July agreed to expand its board from 10 members to 13, and for five members to resign by year's end. With one trustee having resigned shortly before that agreement, that leaves a total of nine openings. Even if the trust does decide to explore a sale of Hershey, the attorney general can thwart such plans. The trust put Hershey up for sale in 2002, and the attorney general's office successfully petitioned a court to block the offer amid local community protests. Pennsylvania attorney general Kathleen Kane stepped down this summer following a criminal conviction. She was succeeded by her deputy, Bruce Castor, and the post is up for election in November.

So they tried a new idea. Student Ideas Group members Gi Gi Strollo, left, Candance Otten and Charles Johnson talk about their e-commerce project to raise money for Rock Hill schools. Jennifer Becknell jbecknell@heraldonline.com Members of the Student Ideas Group designed T-shirts and came up with other products to sell in an online venture to raise money for Rock Hill schools. Jennifer Becknell jbecknell@heraldonline.com 1 of 2 i By Jennifer Becknell jbecknell@heraldonline.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story ROCK HILL Door-to-door sales of cookie dough and wrapping paper are a tough way to raise money. So the members of a Rock Hill Student Ideas Group dreamed up a better way. The group of about two dozen students from Rock Hill’s three high schools, based at the Applied Technology Center, have spent three years laying the groundwork. Now they’re ready to launch a project they hope could raise thousands for Rock Hill schools. The student group, which has been learning about e-commerce, researching products and marketing their ideas, has created two websites. They plan to use the sites to sell clothing and unique products to benefit schools in the Rock Hill district. “It hit me like a rock,” said retired York County businessman Charles Johnson, now a volunteer adult leader of the Applied Technology Center group. “This is the way to do fundraising.” Customers can order and pay for their items online, using credit cards, so students don’t have to handle the money, he said. And the items are shipped directly to the customer, so students don’t have to handle the delivery. Eighty percent of the profit from each purchase will go back to Rock Hill schools, he said, and buyers can choose one or more schools they want the purchase to benefit. The remaining 20 percent of the profit goes to pay student interns who are leading the project and other expenses, including a Rock Hill packing company that is handling orders. Students say the project has been an eye-opening experience in what it’s really like to run a small business. “Now I have the tools to start my own business, and I think it’s something I would like to look into,” said South Pointe High senior Chase Starnes, 17. Spencer Simon, 16, a Rock Hill High student, got involved in the project because of his interest in using social media. But he’s learned so much about marketing, distribution and other facets of a business that now he’d like to be an entrepreneur. Northwestern High sophomore Helena Hubbard, 15, learned about teamwork and communication. “I’ve got an idea how to work on a project in the workplace,” she said. Johnson, who spent 25 years with Proctor and Gamble as a sales and marketing manager, said the idea germinated several years ago, when he began speaking to Applied Technology Center marketing classes. Students’ ideas drove the project, he said. The students wanted to create a website to raise money for schools through sales, and they did research and surveys on what type of products they should sell. They also prepared plans to market their sites. Johnson said students ended up with two websites. One, www.baystgarment.com, will focus on ongoing sales of T-shirts and other clothing designed by students, with the aim of providing a steady stream of revenue. The second site, www.studentig.org, will have fundraisers for a scheduled period, with time in between for students to reorganize. It sells unique, needed products that are both safe and environmentally friendly, a criteria the students set. “The students have really great ideas,” said Jerry Shuler, another adult volunteer with the group. “They just need some direction.” Johnson said students did research and conducted surveys to decide which of hundreds of items should be sold on the website. They narrowed it down to 15. Some of the products include a $26.99 shoe and boot scraper, a $19.95 wall-mounted grocery bag dispenser, a $29.95 car dog harness and a $19.95 garden tool organizer. Buyers can also purchase gift bundles and a $16.95 food package for homeless or needy students in Rock Hill schools. The group doesn’t get a profit from the food package, Johnson said. Starnes said part of the goal of the project is to find ways to give back to the community. The group hopes the money it raises can be used to supplement the financial support for school organizations and parent-teacher groups. Students have recently begun marketing the idea with 200 signs set up across Rock Hill, and they plan to distribute 500 posters in restaurants and retail stores. They are also doing promotions with school principals, Parent-Teacher Organization leaders and teachers. Shuler said the group doesn’t yet know how much money it might generate, but there’s lots of potential. If the group sells 2,000 T-shirts – about one to each student at either Rock Hill or Northwestern high schools – that would generate around $16,000 to donate to Rock Hill schools, he said. Johnson said the idea has potential to benefit other school districts and other nonprofit groups, such as churches. As one student, Kennedy Reed said, it could “make an impact on the world.” Jennifer Becknell: 803-329-4077 More information A Rock Hill Student Ideas Group has launched two websites to sell clothing and other items, with profits to benefit Rock Hill schools.

Ogg October 15, 2016 11:35 am EST Print Email Tweet The week of October 14 was a volatile one, considering how there has been a lack of volatility most of the summer. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) ended the week down roughly 102 points at 18,138.38. Still, investors have become prone to buying their favorite stocks any time the market sells off. High valuations, and even the notion that this bull market is now seven and a half years old, have not thwarted investor appetites. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each morning, and this ends up being hundreds of analyst calls each week. Our goal is to find new investing and trading ideas for our readers. Some of these reports cover stocks to buy that are blue chip stocks. When investors hear the word “blue chip” it generally means DJIA stocks with solid dividends. Sometimes this also refers to former Dow stocks, or stocks that might become Dow stocks. Here, we stick by the traditional Dow stocks. Here were six solid Buy ratings (which includes equivalent Outperform or Overweight ratings) issued in the blue chips during the week of October 14. Just remember: sometimes analysts are wrong, and even the great blue chip stocks come with no guarantees. Apple Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been on a serious recovery. The iPhone maker is winning from Samsung’s smartphone recall and cancellation, and Apple finished up 3.1% this week at $117.66, for a 13% gain so far in 2016. It turns out that multiple analysts raised their targets, either on share price targets or on their estimates for sales and earnings. 24/7 Wall St. tracked several major analyst calls this last week, with Credit Suisse even calling for $150 per share next year, and it even shows a trend of more upgraded estimates the prior week as well. Apple has a 52-week trading range of $89.47 to $123.82, and it has a Thomson Reuters consensus analyst price target of $127.59. Most investors do not buy Apple for its yield, but the company is buying back stock rapidly, and it still comes with almost a 2% dividend yield to boot. Caterpillar It would appear that Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) is in a stealth turnaround. The company’s numbers are still bad, and the trends look in decline from prior growth years. Still, sometimes the investing community treats value and serious stock sell-offs differently. Amazingly, Caterpillar is the top performing Dow stock of 2016, with a gain of 33% so far this year, and it still pays a 3.5% dividend yield. Caterpillar was raised to Buy from Neutral with a $112 price target at Goldman Sachs on October 11. The prior close was $88.22, and Caterpillar ended the week at $87.67. Its 52-week range is $56.36 to $89.87, and its consensus analyst target is $77.37. Investors need to consider that this is the highest analyst target of all now, and Goldman Sachs expects margin expansion and an earnings recovery much greater than investors have expected. Merck While Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) remains close to a 52-week high, investors should not overlook the fact that it is up 20.5% so far in 2016. Merrill Lynch raised its rating on the stock to Buy from Neutral on October 13. Its price objective was raised to $70 from $57 as well, and that is above the $67.79 consensus target. Note that the Merrill Lynch call is based on compelling data for its Keytruda first line lung cancer drug. The firm sees it becoming the standard of care and having 25% share. Merck has a 52-week trading range of $47.97 to $64.86, and its dividend yield is right a 3%. Nike Nike Inc. (NYSE: NKE) has been down and out in 2016, logging the worst performance this year of all 30 Dow stocks with close to a 17% negative return. That isn’t the growth engine we were used to. After the latest earnings report offered disappointing futures sales, Susquehanna decided that enough is enough. The firm raised Nike’s rating to Positive from Neutral on October 11, and it assigned a $63 price target too. The prior closing price was $51.79. The consensus price target now is $63.71, though Thomson Reuters showed a consensus of closer to $67 just 90 days ago. Nike close out the week at $51.62 a share, and its 52-week range is $51.48 to $68.19. The dividend yield is currently only 1.25%, but the company has much more room to grow that payout in the years ahead. Procter & Gamble It may still be a boring blue chip in consumer products, but Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) just keeps chugging along. Now it has a brand sale under its belt in the long road of restructuring into a slimmer and more core-focused company. Independent research firm Argus came out swinging here, saying that the street is grossly undervaluing the growth prospects and underestimating its value. Argus raised the stock to a Buy from Hold on October 12, and it assigned a $103 price target as well. This target compared with a prior close of $88.54, as well as a 52-week trading range of $73.50 to $90.33. The consensus price target at Thomson Reuters is $92.28. Procter & Gamble still comes with an impressive 4% dividend yield, and it has been among the few 50-year dividend gainers and likely will keep raising that payout ahead.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Oct 15, 2016 at 10:29AM Stocks fell slightly last week as quarterly earnings results began to trickle in. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) and the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) each lost less than 1% to hold at 4% gains so far in 2016. ^DJI data by YCharts. Third-quarter earnings season hits high gear over the next few trading days, with dozens of the market's biggest companies set to announce their results. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stocks could see significant swings following the companies' reports. Netflix's growth slowdown Netflix posts its quarterly report after the market closes on Monday, and investors might want to buckle up for some intense volatility. After all, the streaming video giant fell 13% on the day following its last quarterly report, which showed a surprising subscriber growth slowdown. Narcos. Image Source: Netflix. CEO Reed Hastings and his executive team aren't projecting much of a rebound this time around. Netflix is expecting to add just 2.3 million new users in the quarter compared to 3.6 million in the year-ago period. Challenges detracting from growth should include more defections tied to its price hike in addition to the negative impact of global attention turning to the Olympic games. On the plus side, the company aims to post improving profitability, as a larger percentage of its U.S. member base rolls on to its pricier plans, and as international markets begin to mature toward positive contributions. Hastings will also have plenty to say about the company's ambitious content strategy that this quarter included the launch of its multi-year exclusive content deal with Disney. Bank of America's low expectations Bank of America will announce its earnings results before the market opens on Monday. Despite solid gains over the last three months, the banking giant's stock is underperforming the broader market this year, and remains mired at a lower valuation than its peers.  That trend might not quickly change, especially as it appears that the current low-interest-rate environment will persist for years to come. That big-picture headwind can be seen pinching its results this quarter, even after last quarter's strong results. Consensus estimates call for earnings to fall to $0.33 per share from $0.37 per share in Q3, and for sales to stay flat against the prior-year period, at $20.9 billion.  The company can't do much about the cyclical pressure on its industry, but a focus on building up its loan and deposit balances while cutting costs should put it in position to reap big rewards when interest rates finally move higher. In the meantime, surprisingly strong results from its peers suggest that shareholders might be in for some good news this week. Johnson & Johnson's product pipeline Healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson is due to post earnings numbers on Tuesday morning. Judging by the stock's moves lately, investors are expecting to hear plenty of good news. Accelerating sales and profit growth over the last few quarters have helped JNJ rise 17% so far this year, making it the fourth-best performer on the Dow. Image source: Getty Images. Last quarter, for example, revenue rose 5%, after accounting for negative currency swings, compared to a 2% boost for Procter & Gamble. And unlike its consumer-goods-focused peer, Johnson & Johnson saw market-share gains across its portfolio. CEO Alex Gorsky said at the time that executives are seeing "strong underlying growth across our enterprise." Investors are looking for more of the same this quarter: Consensus estimates call for earnings to jump 11%, to $1.65 per share, as revenue rises 4%. Investors can look for the pharmaceutical giant to again be the standout performer, as Johnson & Johnson's huge commitment to research and development continues to produce a strong new-product pipeline. One-quarter of the healthcare giant's sales come from products launched over just the last five years, and keeping up that pace requires a constant stream of groundbreaking introductions.
