By: IANS | New York | Updated: March 30, 2017 10:48 AM App Annie projects that revenues for Google Play and third-party Android offerings will be roughly similar with billion in Google Play revenues and billion for other offerings, the report added. (Reuters) Users of Google’s Android operating system will spend $41 billion in total on apps and subscriptions in 2017, topping $40 billion for Apple, a new report has found. App Annie, which focuses on data related to the mobile-app ecosystem, projected that Apple would still have the most dominant single app store. Apple’s App Store racked up $34 billion in sales in 2016, while Android apps collected $27 billion, a report in MarketWatch website said on Wednesday. Although Google has its own Google Play online destination for apps, there are several third-party offerings for devices that run on the Android operating system. App Annie projects that revenues for Google Play and third-party Android offerings will be roughly similar with $21 billion in Google Play revenues and $20 billion for other offerings, the report added. Another reason for this might be the number of devices used. You May Also Want to Watch: Android should be expected to outpace Apple because Android devices outnumber iOS devices by about a 5-to-1 ratio worldwide, Danielle Levitas, Senior Vice President of research for App Annie, was quoted as saying. “So there’s much room for movement and while this shift might happen in 2017, ultimately, we forecast the App Store remaining the most lucrative store in the next five years,” Levitas said. According to market research firm Gartner, Android had more than 80 per cent of the smartphone market share in 2016 while iOS was at 17.7 per cent, yet Apple routinely takes a majority of global profits in selling its devices.

While the update mostly has security patches, it also introduced some of the most sought-after features that dramatically enhance the iPhone experience. Here is a list of some of the major upgraded features on iOS 10.3 that will make you want to update to the newer version as soon as possible. More storage space The newest version of iOS now replaces the ageing HFS+ with Apple File System (APFS) primarily to support 64 bit architecture. However, what’s more interesting is that it also makes the new OS more efficient in how it formats volume storage at the same time takes lesser overall space then the earlier version. Did Apple steal the idea of ‘Find My AirPods’? As a result you will now have more overall storage space available on your iOS device. Users have reported increase in storage space from 2GBs to as much as 8GBs depending on the total storage capacity of the device. Find my AirPods This is perhaps the most useful feature for those who use Apple’s latest wireless headphones. The operating software now has a dedicated Find my AirPods tool that allows users to track their AirPods by showing the last location they were paired or send a loud ping signal to track their location. Weather in Maps The latest version of Apple’s navigation app on iOS 10.3 now features a dedicated weather icon at the bottom right corner of the screen. The latest addition to Maps allows users to get a quick glimpse of the weather wherever they are going. Apple launches new app for Instagram and Facebook Integrated the weather app with Apple Maps then makes the experiece seamless especially for those who travel frequently. Apple ID profile iOS users will also be able to see a new profile section at the top of the settings menu with all their account information. The profile will now bring together information from iCloud, iTunes, App Store and Family Sharing together all in one place and will also show a list of all the Apple devices linked to these accounts.

The report suggest that Apple’s App Store will pull in $40bn (£32bn, AU$52bn) by the end of 2017, an increase of $6bn from last year’s figures, while Google Play is looking at raking in $21bn (£17bn, AU$27bn). The combination of this rather strong projected earning from Google Play with other popular Android stores, such as Samsung’s and Amazon’s, is expected to bring that total up to $41bn.  Impressively, while the Apple App Store is predicted to double the earnings of the Play Store, the amount of the applications actually downloaded is only around a quarter of Google’s. This could indicate a number of things, amongst them is the possibility that Android users are more likely to download free apps and are less likely to splurge on in-app purchases, or that there are more free options. Also worth noting is the continuation of money-making potential that games tend to see over other apps, with less games being downloaded compared with the percentage of revenue they rake in, and this trend is expected to exaggerate over the next five years. App Annie’s study considers the market's growth up until 2021 and has predicted that Apple will keep its lead over Google regarding their respective stores, but that the margin between overall Apple to Android apps will continue increasing up to $18bn (£14bn, AU$23bn).  Apple shines the spotlight on indie games on the App Store Topics Android Related news Arizona Sunshine is one of the best VR games you’ve never heard of How the FCC internet privacy rules rollback puts a price tag on your data Facebook Live now supports 360-degree video for a more immersive view Google IO 2017: dates, rumors and news for Google's big developer conference See more World of tech news Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

One of the not-so-obvious new features of the software pertains to customizable app icons as seen on the MLB.com At Bat and NHL iOS apps. The MLB.com At Bat and NHL iOS apps were recently given an update and now allows users to change their home screen app icons featuring their favorite teams, as first reported by 9To5Mac. Users can change the app icon by opening the app and heading to More > Settings > Set Home Screen Icon. Users will then be able to select their favorite team from a list and the they will have to  tap “OK” to apply changes. MLB.com At Bat More Photo of the MLB.com At Bat app where a user can pick their favorite team as its home screen icon. Photo: 9To5Google Alternate icons for iOS apps were first discovered earlier this year by developers who had access to the beta versions of iOS 10.3. At the time, no one was really sure that Apple was intending to release it as an actual feature. Now, it looks like the Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League are the very first to take advantage of the new iOS feature. However, it looks like customizable app icons for Apple devices have some restrictions and limitations. Developers that want to offer personalized icons must create the necessary files in advance in order to include them on their apps, according to TechCrunch. Apple also recommends that the feature will only be included in apps that have theme customizations as its main feature. Another setback with personalized icons is that it can only be changed by the user’s request. This means that developers aren’t allowed to change the app icons at will unless it’s part of a major software update. This also means that developers won’t be able to add support for dynamic app icons. For example, a weather app’s icon won’t change based on the current weather conditions. With the MLB.com At Bat and NHL apps, adding personalized app icons makes sense especially for big-time fans of a particular team. It won’t be long before other apps will offer the same feature as long as developers are compliant to Apple’s strict rules. iPhoneMore The iOS 10.3 update for the iPhone includes a feature that allows users to personalize an app's home screen icon.

To do that, of course, Samsung must recover from the disastrous recall of its last premium phone, the Galaxy Note 7. Samsung was forced to discontinue that product after a rash of battery fires, and also chose to delay the launch of these new phones in the wake of the controversy. DJ Koh, the head of Samsung’s mobile division, opened the presentation by acknowledging that 2016 had been a difficult yearfor the company. But he also added that this launch marks the start of “important new beginnings.” Samsung was clearly eager to move on and reclaim its reputation as an innovator. Before the Note 7, Samsung had shaken off its old image of being a copycat and had ushered in the era of larger-screened phones — a move that arguably prompted its chief rival, Apple, to make a larger iPhone, analysts said. Overall, analysts said that Samsung pulled off a strong performance Wednesday, and possibly set the tone for a more innovative smartphone cycle in 2017. “We are seeing some great design innovation from Samsung this year and expect the same from Apple,” said Jefferson Wang, senior partner at IBB Consulting, in an email. The phones released this year — with curved screens and big displays — should set a new template for the next couple of years, he said. In terms of innovation, Samsung's new phones pick up where the company had left off. © Provided by WP Company LLC d/b/a The Washington Post The two handsets, fitted with screens of 5.8 and 6.2 inches, include Samsung's upgraded digital assistant Bixby, competing in a crowded field that includes Apple's Siri, Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. / AFP PHOTO / Timothy A. CLARYTIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP/Getty Images As expected, the S8 and S8 Plus ditch the physical home button to give the touch screen as much real estate as possible. As with Samsung's Galaxy Edge devices, the phones also have displays that curve over their sides. The new devices have a variety of security features — an iris scanner, fingerprint scanner and facial recognition sensor — that can be used to secure the phone as well as other services, including Samsung Pay and Samsung Health. The phones will go on sale on April 21, on AT&T,Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint. While prices may vary by carrier and payment plan, the suggested price of the Galaxy S8 is $720; the Galaxy S8 Plus will cost $840. The screens for the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus measure 5.8 inches and 6.2 inches, respectively, but are slim enough to fit in one hand without feeling too bulky. Samsung also introduced a new mode, DeX, that allows the phones to plug into a monitor and special charging dock and perform desktop functions such as email and even Microsoft Word programs. The dock is sold separately. Samsung revealed more about its new digital assistant, Bixby. The voice-controlled assistant is integrated with the phones' cameras so users can snap pictures of products, which Bixby will then search for online. The assistant can figure out your location from a picture and look for restaurants or other attractions nearby. Unlike its closest competitor, Apple's Siri, Bixby can also fully control some apps by voice — but, right now, nearly all of those apps are made by Samsung. © Hayley Tsukayama/The Washington Post Bixby is still not as comprehensive as many analysts had hoped. “Samsung’s initial Bixby implementation falls short of its goal of being a comprehensive AI assistant because of weak app integration and limited voice compatibility,” said Ian Fogg, analyst at IHS Markit, in an email. Until Samsung expands the assistant — and supports languages apart from English and Korean — it won’t be competitive, Fogg added. In fact, he said, many users may not even choose it for the S8, which also ships with a Bixby competitor, Google Assistant. The Galaxy S8 provides hints of Samsung's ambition to be a major player in the smart home market. The company introduced an app called Samsung Connect, which shows users a unified list of all their smart devices, and lets them control them from the phone. As might be expected, the products listed in the demo, including a refrigerator and a robot vacuum, were all made by Samsung. That was a nod to the broad base of products that Samsung makes, which gives it an advantage over Apple and Google — the latter is its partner on Android but also its smart home rival. The company also continued to tout its progress in virtual reality, which it views as a complement to its mobile phone business. Samsung introduced a new version of its 360-degree camera, the Gear 360, which is now able to live stream video while recording. Samsung's new features should also push Apple, analysts say. “The consumer is the big winner in all of this. We have genuine first class competition among major players,” said Thomas Cooke, professor at Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business.

He’s not going far though. Terry will still manage an email team, but it’s for the Spark email app owned by Readdle. Here’s what this could mean for the future of Apple Mail. Details Of The Move Readdle is a small company based in Odessa, Ukraine. They have created a host of productivity apps like PDF Expert and Spark. Readdle wants to change the future of work, and email is a big part of that future, with Readdle CEO Igor Zhadanov saying: Email is not going anywhere and has to be reinvented. The team has done a phenomenal job so far and we are committed to shaping the future of email. Terry is a valuable addition to the team and brings years of experience from one of the best companies in the world. Terry says he shares this vision of the future of email with Readdle: Spark is modernizing email as we know it. We share a fundamental vision of what the future of email should be. I’ve always admired Readdle for their beautiful and innovative products, which makes them the ideal company to turn that vision into a reality. Of course, that begs the question: What stopped him from realizing this email vision with Apple? Reading between the lines, it sounds as if Apple isn’t innovating fast enough when it comes to email. It’s possible that Apple Mail is going in a different direction than what Terry Blanchard prefers. Terry Blanchard with Readdle team What Does This Mean? So what does this mean for the future of Apple Mail? If the email team isn’t innovating, what if the Mail team goes away like the automation team did? Or, Apple could acquire an email development team like its recent acquisition of Workflow. If we look at other email apps, it becomes clear that a major trend is the introduction of smart mail with artificial intelligence built in. Mail does have certain smart features right now, like automatically adding events to your calendar. But there is much room for improvement, such as Siri having more of a presence within the Mail app, or automatically sorting email into categories, like rival Spark. With the release of iOS 10.3, Apple has started to collect iCloud Analytics for users that opt-in. This could be a great way to improve Mail. And it’s also certainly possible that Apple is already planning to improve Mail in iOS 11. By this time of year, much of the development of the next iOS version is sure to be largely done, so let’s cross our fingers as we wait for WWDC 2017.

March 29, 2017 at 10:22 EDT PM JonGl March 30, 2017 I switched to Google Inbox. It does the best job of shoving unwanted emails out of the way (forums, promos, social updates, and other, non-social updates) so I can see my real email. I suppose if I had a lot of personal and work email, I could use InBox to even further divide things, but for me, having InBox on a web browser tab, not requiring a separate email program has worked best. IMO, I suspect that the future of email is something more along these lines, rather than standalone programs. Honestly, I don’t want “offline” email access, nor having to deal with mailbox databases, etc. It’s too high maintenance for me now. Oh, and mail rules, etc… yuck. So, yeah, I suspect that email is going to radically change, and is changing… I don’t know what Apple Mail or even Spark can do to make me a customer again… March 30, 2017 at 2:59 EDT AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Variety reported Wednesday that Spotify has purchased a show called Traffic Jams. Clearly borrowing from Apple Music’s Carpool Karaoke, Traffic Jams puts hip-hop producers and artists in a car and asks them to make a song in the back seat. We Apple fans may be inclined to dismiss this show because it’s a blatant ripoff. Ignore that instinct, though—that’s the way the TV industry works. Folks copy ideas, and sometimes they build on them. Instead, Spotify—which is beating Apple on users—is effectively validating Apple Music’s approach of using original video content to boost its steaming music business. That’s very interesting to me.

The market's latest contender, Oppo, arrived in the country this month, debuting three of its smartphones at a low-key launch event. The Chinese manufacturer has previously sold other electronic devices in New Zealand, but this is the first time it has tried selling phones here. Huawei, one of the big sellers in New Zealand, is set to launch its P10 smartphone next week, and global giant Samsung unveiled its much-anticipated Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus range today. This year will also mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and rumours are circulating about Apple's plans for an anniversary edition of the device. With some 1.8 million smartphones sold in New Zealand last year, the big names are vying for a slice of the market. "Traditionally the New Zealand smartphone market has been a two-horse race, led by Samsung and Apple - especially in the high-end space," says Chayse Gorton, a market analyst with research company IDC. "Huawei has ramped up share when comparing 2016 with 2015, which was expected with the large amount of marketing dollars they have invested in the country. A lot of Huawei's shipment growth has come from the low-end space." Last year, Samsung had the highest market share as measured by shipments to New Zealand, with 35 per cent of the market according to IDC data. Apple was close behind on 29 per cent, with Huawei making up 15 per cent. Huawei has declared open season on Apple and Samsung, vowing to knock them off their market leaders' perch within five years and targeting 25 per cent of the global market. Continued below. Related Content Apple could render the iPhone 5 obsolete Samsung unveils S8: The iPhone killer Video Watch NZH Focus: New Samsung S8 In the last quarter of 2016, Huawei accounted for 10.6 per cent of the 428.5 million smartphones shipped globally. Huawei has also committed to investing in New Zealand, this week announcing plans to spend $400m in the country over the next five years. The head of the company's consumer business group, Roson Luo, says the investment is proof of its commitment to New Zealand. "The New Zealand market definitely presents growth opportunities for Huawei," Luo says. "[We were] the fastest growing smartphone brand in 2016 and the third most favoured brand ... we expect to see continued market share growth in the mid and high tier segments throughout 2017." Data from IDC shows that in the last quarter of last year, Huawei's share of smartphone shipments to this country jumped to 21 per cent. Newcomer Oppo also has ambitions to take on Apple and Samsung in New Zealand. The company's head of marketing in this country, Kuan Li, says the brand is now the world's fourth largest mobile phone maker. He says Oppo has already taken the top spot in China - its home country - and it is only a matter of time before this happens in New Zealand. The just-unveiled Samsung Galaxy S8 aims to remedy the missteps of the Galaxy 7. Photo / Getty "From my point of view, our target isn't Huawei - we're both targeting Samsung and Apple really," says Li. "We want to offer consumers in New Zealand more options than just Apple and Samsung." Gorton says Oppo will need to build its brand awareness with Kiwi consumers, in order to succeed in this market. "In New Zealand, they are relatively unknown, hence will need to invest a lot of marketing dollars if they wish to succeed." He says the brand appears to be targeting the mid-range sector of the market. In recent times, says Gorton, consumers have tended to opt for either flagship devices or low-end phones with a good price for the specifications they offer. Oppo's offering, he says, might convince consumers to consider purchasing a mid-range phone instead. New Zealand's two big telecommunications companies have also staked a claim in the smartphone market, with their own-branded devices. Research from IDC shows Vodafone had an 11 per cent share of smartphone shipments for the last quarter of 2016, with Spark taking 4 per cent. A survey by Research New Zealand found that more than 70 per cent of New Zealanders owned a smartphone in 2015, up from 48 per cent in 2013. The research showed 91 per cent of 18 to 35-year-olds had a smartphone in 2015. For the 35-54 age bracket it was 78 per cent, and 45 per cent in the over-55 age group. Although Samsung held onto its top spot in smartphone shipments last year, it was hard hit by the recall of its Note 7 phones, after problems with the devices overheating and catching fire. The recall and the associated fallout meant the company took a US$5.3 billion ($7.53b) hit to its earnings. Its share of New Zealand shipments in the last quarter of 2016 fell to 26 per cent, with Apple taking the lead at 31 per cent for the quarter. "I think the Note 7 recall influenced Samsung's market share in 2016 Q4," Gorton says. "Traditionally Samsung have high satisfaction, repurchase, and recommendation rates among consumers, hence if they can get the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S8 right, I expect them to win back share." Analysts globally have warned that the pressure is on Samsung to get its S8 series right, to win back public favour. The company has also faced corporate issues in its home, South Korea, with a senior company leader charged with bribery and embezzlement in a national corruption scandal. In New Zealand, however, the company is focusing on moving forward. Asked about growing competition in the market, Samsung's head of mobile in New Zealand, Todd Selwyn, says he isn't too concerned. "It's not really a war," says Selwyn. "The New Zealand market is 90 per cent Apple and Samsung and the others are sort of noise. "In saying that, we do monitor the market and we always want to make sure we give the best value to consumers." More than 2 million Samsung devices are in use in New Zealand and the biggest challenge for the company is ensuring that users are happy with the product and remain Samsung customers. Selwyn says the latest S8 also fits with what New Zealand consumers are looking for. "The market has been pushing into the larger screen devices and people are spending more on their phones every year," Selwyn says. "So in the New Zealand market, volume and value is still growing and over 60 per cent of our market in New Zealand is over $1000 phones so most people are going for an expensive one. "The S8 is firmly targeted in that space - metal and glass construction, the quality of material, the design and software interface etc. is very targeted at the premium end." Samsung is likely to face stiff competition when the iPhone anniversary device is launched this year, with IDC predicting sales will far outstrip the iPhone 7 series. And with Oppo and Huawei both gearing up to challenge the big players, this is one race that shows no sign of reaching the finishing point. - NZ Herald Read more by Holly Ryan Email Holly Ryan Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

The South Korean giant’s mobile chief DJ Koh told a New York event the Galaxy S8 and S8+ handsets marked “a new era of smartphone design.” Fitted with screens of 5.8 and 6.2 inches, the two handsets include Samsung’s upgraded digital assistant Bixby, competing in a crowded field that includes Apple’s Siri, Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. The most striking feature of the new phones is what Samsung dubs an “infinity display” — an expanded glass screen that covers the entire front of the device and appears to curve seamlessly around its edges. The home button has been replaced with a pressure-sensitive section embedded under the screen. Both phones are water resistant and allow for biometric authentication with fingerprint and iris scanners. Bixby marks a further step into services for the world’s biggest smartphone vendor, allowing users to shop, search for images and get details about nearby places with image recognition technology and geolocation. Samsung’s services chief Sriram Thodla said Bixby would allow for better navigation of applications on the phone. “We’ve built intelligence into the camera,” he said. “If you see something you want to buy, just point the camera at it and Bixby will find it from one of our partners.” The digital assistant will also enhance the phone’s capabilities as a remote control for connected home devices, Thodla said. The South Korean electronics giant late last year bought Viv, an artificial intelligence startup with co-founders who were part of the team that built virtual assistant Siri, which Apple bought some seven years ago. As Samsung’s top-line handsets, the Galaxy S8 models will challenge the latest Apple iPhones. The new phones will be available starting April 21, Samsung said. In the US market, they will be sold through major carriers and retailers, with unlocked devices priced from $725. – After the debacle – The Galaxy S8 release comes after Samsung was forced to recall its Note 7 phones for catching fire due to overheating batteries. The debacle cost the South Korean company billions of dollars in lost profit and hammered its global reputation and credibility, during a torrid period that has also seen it embroiled in a corruption scandal. Its vice-chairman Lee Jae-Yong, heir to the parent Samsung group, has been arrested and indicted for bribery, along with four other senior executives, in connection with a graft scandal that saw ex-president Park Geun-Hye impeached. Samsung apologized to consumers for the recall and was forced to postpone the S8 launch. Its investigation blamed the problems on faulty batteries. The firm later embarked on a campaign to restore its battered reputation, placing full-page advertisements in US newspapers that admitted it “fell short” on its promises. The tech giant says it has also come up with elaborate step-by-step safety verification procedures for future products to prevent similar disasters. As part of its launch, Samsung will be including its Gear virtual reality headset to customers pre-ordering the handsets. Samsung also introduced its Dex adapter which allows the smartphones to be transformed into desktop computers. – Positive reviews – Analysts offered generally positive reviews while expressing caution over the high price tag. “The price of the new phones is up to $100 higher than their predecessors and almost all of the premium smartphones they’ll be competing with, which feels like a big risk,” said Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. Dawson said Samsung is betting “that its phones will justify a higher price, whereas it could have used these new phones as a way to drive higher sales after a couple of years of stagnation.” Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy said he was “impressed than I thought I’d be,” adding that Samsung had “done everything they could at this point” to produce a quality handset. Avi Greengart of the consultancy Current Analysis said in a tweet that the new phone “has a lot of new tech but not much changed in the camera. Its all about the (amazing) form factor.” #GalaxyS8 IT lifestyle samsung SKorea us 2017-03-30 The Independent Share Facebook Twitter Google + LinkedIn Tags #GalaxyS8 IT lifestyle samsung SKorea us Recent Popular Comments Tags Tanzanians protest detention for 4 years without trial March 30, 2017 Chief Justice receives report on massive case backlog March 30, 2017 ‘Down with Zuma’ chants at S.Africa freedom icon’s funeral March 30, 2017 Kenya court orders parliament to pass gender quota March 30, 2017 India’s parliament passes key tax reform bills March 30, 2017 Reports say official took millions in doping bribes November 26, 2016 49,300 Sports: Three great comebacks March 9, 2017 46,227 BUSINESS BRIEFS: NSSF increases stake in Umeme, MTN cuts rates November 15, 2016 30,558 Controversy over Ghana’s elephant size cabinet March 26, 2017 20,641 Learning from the market April 10, 2016 15,747 Kizito Kayizzi: Well-stated.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Mar 29, 2017 at 9:41PM A few years ago, analysts claimed that PCs would be rendered obsolete by waves of new mobile devices. While shipments of PCs have indeed fallen for five straight years, according to Gartner, demand for PCs recently warmed up as new premium and 2-in-1 devices entered the market. Within this market, you probably won't find companies with double-digit sales or earnings growth. Instead, you'll find mature tech stocks that trade at reasonable valuations and pay decent dividends. Let's take a look at three good income plays in this market -- Lenovo (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Image source: Getty Images. Lenovo Chinese tech giant Lenovo is the biggest PC maker in the world. Its global market share grew from 19.9% to 21.7% between 2015 and 2016, according to Gartner. Last quarter, 70% of Lenovo's revenue came from its PCSD (PC and Smart Devices) business, which consists of PCs, laptops, 2-in-1s, convertibles, and tablets. 18% came from its Mobile Business, and 9% came from the Data Center business. The PCSD unit posted 2% annual sales growth last quarter, but that didn't offset declines at both the Mobile and Data Center segments, which caused its total revenue to fall 6%. Analysts believe that Lenovo's revenue will fall 4% this year, but it should still generate a narrow profit, compared to a net loss in fiscal 2016. Lenovo has a trailing yield of 5.2%, but that yield is currently at a multi-year high due to the stock's 24% decline over the past five years. It only pays two dividends annually -- a higher interim dividend in the middle of the year and a lower final dividend at the end. Lenovo started paying those dividends in 2014, and only raised the interim dividend once in 2015.  Lenovo doesn't follow specific rules regarding dividend payments, but its trailing payout ratio of 47% indicates that it can easily support its current yield. The stock also trades at just 12 times earnings, which is slightly lower than its industry average of 13. Hewlett-Packard Hewlett-Packard is the second biggest PC maker in the world. Gartner reports that its market share rose from 18.3% to 19.4% between 2015 and 2016. Last quarter, 65% of HP's revenue came from PC sales, and the rest came from sales of printers and imaging devices. HP's PC sales rose 10% annually during the quarter, thanks to rising demand for premium, convertible, and 2-in-1 devices, but printer sales declined. HP's curved Envy all-in-one PC. Image source: HP. Wall Street expects HP's sales and earnings to stay nearly flat this year. However, the recovery of the PC market and the growth of its printer business -- boosted by new products like mobile and industrial 3D printers, as well as its planned acquisition of Samsung's printing business -- should eventually help it return to growth over the next few years. HP pays a forward yield of 3.1%, which is easily supported by its payout ratio of 33%. The company notably generated over $700 million in free cash flow last quarter, but spent more than $600 million on buybacks and dividends. HP is also fairly cheap at 12 times earnings. Apple Apple is the fifth largest PC maker in the world, but Gartner reports that its market share slipped from 7.1% in 2015 to 6.9% in 2016. Mac sales fell year-over-year for several straight quarters, but sales and shipments finally rebounded during the first quarter on its refreshed MacBook Pros. Apple's new MacBook Pro. Image source: Apple. Mac sales rose 7% annually during that quarter and accounted for 9% of its top line. 69% still came from the iPhone, 7% came from the iPad, and the rest came from Services and other products. Analysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to respectively grow 6% and 8% this year as iPhone sales rise and services like Apple Pay and Apple Music grow. Apple pays a forward yield of 1.6%. That might seem paltry, but its payout ratio of 27% indicates that the company could easily double its dividend in the future. Apple has also hiked that dividend every year since reintroducing it in 2012. Apple's P/E of 17 makes it a pricier play than Lenovo or HP, but that premium is justified by its higher growth rates. The key takeaways Lenovo, HP, and Apple should all benefit from growing demand for PCs, but investors should also note each company's flaws. Lenovo is too heavily exposed to the saturated smartphone market, the recovery of HP's printing business is still speculative, and Apple still relies too much on the iPhone. But for investors who want fairly cheap stocks with decent dividends, these three computer stocks might just fit the bill. Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Reuters/Brendan McDermid Latest Samsung Galaxy Note 8 leaks have suggested that the device will be coming with a dual-camera setup. It will be interesting to see how the flagship fares against the Apple iPhone 8 Plus and HTC 11. The dual-camera setup seemed likely considering Samsung’s investment in Core Photonics. The latter specialises in dual-lens technology. As per a leaked patent from Korea, there will be two camera sensors housed in the slim chassis. This will considerably improve the low-light shooting capabilities. This camera setup will also help in distance measurements and 3D mapping. OIS will be a major feature. There could also be a zooming solution. As regards pricing, Samsung has been able to deliver at more affordable price points in recent generations. According to ValueWalk, Samsung will undercut Apple iPhone 8 Plus with the price tag of its Galaxy Note 8. The device may retail at around US$900 (AU$1,180 approx). Already there are rumblings that the Apple flagship will have a price tag in excess of US$1,000 (AU$1,310 approx). It is commonly believed that Apple will release three handsets this year, and it is not yet known whether the price applies to the more affordable versions of the premium iPhone 8 Plus. The iPhone 8, 10th anniversary edition, could also be called the iPhone X. The Apple iPhone 8 Plus is expected to come with the largest display ever in any iPhone. The 5.8-inch display could come with curved screen technology. Apple may also include OLED technology for the first time. The screen resolution will also be upgraded. Samsung may respond by introducing 4K display in its Galaxy Note 8 flagship. The wraparound display could be as large as 6.4 inches. The upcoming premium iPhone could come with a maximum integrated storage capacity of 256GB. Apple always beats Samsung on this front. Samsung, in response, may use microSD technology to provide storage capacity of up to 256GB. The internal storage capacity will remain at 64GB. microSD will be absent in the Apple device. With an increase in screen size, Apple may also boost the RAM in iPhone 8 Plus. A 4GB RAM is possible, though there are rumours that the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 will have a larger RAM capacity of 6GB. An Iris scanner and wireless charging tech are highly-anticipated in the Apple device. AR could also be a major draw for the Apple flagship. Note 8 will be made compatible with Samsung Gear VR tech. As regards camera technology, the Apple iPhone 8 will likely have a 12MP dual camera with OIS and 4K recording. Experts believe that there will be no discernible difference in photographic capabilities between the two devices. Meanwhile, the HTC 11 is expected to come with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset, 4-6GB RAM, 32 and 64GB internal storage variants and 12MP rear and 8MP front cameras, reports The Hack Post. The HTC 11 may have a 5.5-inch display with a screen resolution of 1,440 x 2,560 pixels. It will run on Android 7.0 Nougat OS, powered by Quick Charge 4.0 and 3,700 mAh battery. More details are expected from HTC soon.

Apple has new changes for developers. Image: B. Tongo/Epa/REX/Shutterstock By Karissa Bell2017-03-30 02:22:11 UTC Apple is making more moves to clean up its App Store.  After cracking down on outdated apps, the company is now placing restrictions on how developers describe their apps. Apple is now rejecting updated and new app submissions that have the word "free" in the name, VentureBeat reports. SEE ALSO: Apple could kill almost 200,000 apps with iOS 11 "Your app’s name, icons, screenshots, or previews to be displayed on the App Store include references to your app’s price," Apple reportedly pointed out.   "Please remove any references to your app’s price from your app’s name, including any references to your app being free or discounted." Apple has yet to comment on the change other than to confirm its existence but the policy change is yet another sign Cupertino is looking to clean up its App Store. The company is also cracking down on outdated apps that haven't been optimized for newer iPhones and iPads, which could include as many as 200,000 apps. That's in addition to the 47,000 apps Apple removed earlier this year.  Image: Robert Schlesinger/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images While the change in how developers describe their apps in the App Store seems like a more subtle shift, it fits with the company's ongoing efforts to scrub old and low-quality apps out of its store. Many developers use "free" in their app names to try and game the store's search algorithms and lure new users. Doing so may help an app appear higher in some search results but few high-quality apps actually use the word "free" in their name (with the possible exception of apps that have both a free and paid app). Apple could now be trying to crack down on apps with spammy-sounding names to improve the overall quality of its App Store, Or, the company could simply be trying to reduce confusion. As Apple notes in its developer guidelines, referencing a price in an app name could be confusing to people in other countries where the price may be different. Whatever the case, we're likely hear more in at Apple's World Wide Developer Conference later this year.

The cost is estimated at $27 million that will likely open its doors sometime in October.   James McGrath, a partner at Foster + Partners, the London-based architectural firm that designed the Chicago store and Apple's Cupertino, Calif., headquarters stated that "We wanted the building to be as light and transparent as possible." Eventually the store will have floor-to-ceiling glass wall opening a view from the Pioneer Court Plaza to the river. The concept drawing above makes it look like a roof and to center beams.   If you've ever been to Chicago and travelled down the Magnificent Mile, then you'll be able to tell where this Apple store is located. As you can see in the bottom photo, Trump's building is on the other side of the bridge.   Foster + Partners McGrath added that "We want it to be more than just a shopping experience." This Apple Store will have all of the modern elements like the "Forum" that could host classes and events." It sounds like it's going to be a real tourist attraction when it's completed.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues tvOS 10.2 may cause third-party streaming apps to stop working Roman Loyola 30 March, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News If you use a third-party streaming app to transmit from your Mac or iOS device to the fourth-generation Apple TV, you should check to see if the third-party developer has an update for its software before updating your Apple TV to tvOS 10.2. According to a report by AppleInsider, tvOS 10.2 including functionality that makes the Apple TV require device verification from an AirPlay streaming device. AppleInsider says that only Apple hardware can provide such verification. This new verification requirement can cause third-party streaming apps to not work. A blog post by Rogue Amoeba’s Paul Kafasis states that tvOS 10.2 prevents the company’s AirFoil app for Mac and Windows from working with the Apple TV. Rogue Amoeba recommends not updating to tvOS 2 until the company has a fix for AirFoil. The issue does seem to be resolvable, however. Software developer Squirrels has AirParrot, which allows users to stream media from one device to another. About two weeks ago, Squirrels released an AirParrot update that specifically states that it makes AirParrot compatible with tvOS 10.2. Apple released tvOS 10.2 last Monday. The update includes accelerated scrolling and the ability to swipe the far right side of the Apple TV remote to navigate specific indexes.

Here's everything you need to know about the Apple Watch's latest software updates by Christopher Minasians | 29 Mar 17 Price RRP: FREE Best prices today Retailer Price Delivery   Price comparision from , and manufacturers watchOS 3 news: Current version, latest updates, betas & new features watchOS 3 was unveiled at WWDC in June 2016, and was released to the general public on 13 September 2016; but what are the best new features that watchOS 3 for the Apple Watch? In this article we round up all the information about the new features in watchOS 3 (and in the subsequent, smaller point updates, such as watchOS 3.2) and how to upgrade your Apple Watch to watchOS 3. If you're curious about what's coming next, by the way, take a look at our watchOS 4 rumours article. Read next: Apple Watch buying guide 2017 | Best Apple Watch deals What is watchOS? Let's cover the basics first. The Apple Watch, which went on sale in April 2015, runs an operating system called watchOS, and regular free updates to this software mean Apple Watch owners periodically get access to new features and interface tweaks without having to spend any additional money. An updated version of this software, watchOS 2, came out at WWDC in June 2015 (followed by smaller 'point' updates), so we weren't surprised to see Apple announce and demonstrate watchOS 3 at WWDC 2016 on 13 June 2016. It became available in autumn 2016. Read next: Apple Watch vs Apple Watch 2 How do I get watchOS 3? watchOS 3 is a free public update. Open the Watch app on the iPhone that's paired with your Apple Watch. From the My Watch tab, tap General > Software Update. If there's a watchOS update you've not yet installed, you will be told about it here, and given the opportunity to download and install it on your Apple Watch. Bear in mind that watchOS is tied to iOS, and you may need to update the latter before you're able to update the former. We weren't offered the watchOS 3.2 update, for example, until we installed iOS 10.3. We explain the update process in more detail here: How to update watchOS on an Apple Watch. What's the latest version of watchOS? The most recent update is watchOS 3.2, released to the public in March 2017. (The next version will be watchOS 3.2.2, which is currently in the beta testing phase. We explain how to install watchOS betas in this article.) Here, we list some of the biggest changes and new features in watchOS 3.2. New Siri capabilities watchOS 3.2 brings enhanced Siri capabilities, thanks to the rolling out of SiriKit for Apple Watch (SiriKit was previously limited to iOS apps only). SiriKit allows developers to set up Siri integration for their apps on the watch for a few select uses. You can talk to Siri via your Watch in order to interact with various third-party apps in a way that will be familiar to those who've used iOS 10. Users will be able to order an Uber, send a message through a chat application and more, simply by speaking to the Apple Watch. Theatre Mode Also new in watchOS 3.2 is the addition of Theatre Mode, designed to avoid distracting others in dark environments like the cinema and the theatre. Theatre Mode lets the user mute the sound as well as disable the raise-to-wake feature, just by the touch of a button. Notifications are still received (including the haptic notifier) and can be viewed by pressing the Digital Crown or by tapping the screen. Control Centre reshuffle As well as these changes there is also a subtle change to the Control Centre. With the addition of Theatre Mode, Apple decided to move some of the buttons on the Control Centre, moving Theatre Mode to the bottom of the panel next to AirPlay. watchOS 3's design & graphical elements Apple's design and interface teams have made some tweaks to visual aspects of watchOS for this update. Here's what to expect. Read next: Apple Watch tips: watchOS 3 tips & secret features New watch faces Apple unveiled new watch faces, including a Minnie Mouse option that was certainly a crowd-pleaser. There's also an Activity watch face, and you can launch more apps straight from the watch face screen including Workout, Music and Messages. Complications have been introduced to the Photo, Motion and Timelapse faces, too. Redesigned Control Centre The Control Centre has been given a makeover, with it now being easier to access. With the exclusion of Glances in watchOS 3, you can now quickly enter the Control Centre by swiping up from the watch face. This now presents you with a few quick toggles, such as a button allowing you to ping your phone and even toggling airplane mode. Despite being a small update, this new feature greatly improves the user experience and speeds up efficiency when using the Apple Watch. Disable screenshots A very small feature, but useful nevertheless, you can now disable screenshots on your Apple Watch, meaning less accidental screenshots. This is presented as an option within the watch's settings. Read next: Apple Watch Series 3 rumours watchOS 3's new features watchOS 3 is a pretty big update, with lots of new features set to make your Apple Watch experience smoother and faster. Read on for more detail about each of the new features and what they'll mean to you. Dock The new Dock feature is one of our favourites. It makes navigating through apps much easier on your Apple Watch. The Dock will show all of your recent and favourite apps. You access the app dock via the much-maligned side button on the Apple Watch, which used to bring up the favourite contacts dial: we won't miss that. It's always struck us as a niche feature given undeserved prominence - we use our Apple Watches to accept incoming calls and reply to texts, but almost never initiate conversations on it - although we'd be interested to hear from readers who have used it regularly. Instant apps You'll also find that your apps launch much, much faster than they did before. That's because Apple has introduced an instant launch feature, and the apps will update in the background so that the information displayed is accurate, and ready to go, at all times. Apple says watchOS 3 makes the Apple Watch seven times faster at opening new apps. This update might seem minimal, but there cannot be a single Apple Watch user out there who hasn't noticed the device's sluggishness at opening apps, and wishes for some kind of speed boost - watchOS 3 addresses that. Activity and Workout Apple has also improved the Activity and Workout apps to help you stay motivated. You'll be able to share, compare and compete with your contacts, and you'll now get notifications about your friends' progress too. Activity sharing is connected to the Messages app too, so you can send personalised messages of encouragement. With watchOS 3, the Apple Watch can track the activity and fitness of users in wheelchairs. watchOS 3 provides two wheelchair-specific workouts, and determines calories burned in a wheelchair according to how hard the surface is and its gradient, while taking into account different seats and wheel heights. And the "time to stand" fitness notification will be optionally replaced by "time to roll". We discuss the wheelchair-focused features in watchOS 3, as well as looking at alternative fitness trackers for disabled users, in a separate article: Best smartwatches, bands and trackers for wheelchair fitness tracking. Breathe app The Breathe app, introduced in watchOS 3, encourages you to take moments throughout the day to do deep-breathing sessions to control your stress levels. You'll get a heart rate summary after the session, which can last for up to five minutes. We've looked at Breathe in a lot more detail in a separate article. See: What is Breathe for Apple Watch? Quick replies Apple improved the messaging system in watchOS 3. You can use stickers, handwriting, full-screen effects and invisible ink just like the new features in iOS 10. Smart Replies are available within the message notification, and you can use the scribble feature to write custom replies by drawing each letter, which the Apple Watch will convert into text. SOS The SOS app, which is available worldwide so will work wherever you are, even if you're travelling, can be used to call emergency services and alert your emergency contacts right from the Apple Watch. It works using your phone's cellular connection or WiFi. Unlock a Mac with your Apple Watch Fed up of having to enter your password to unlock your Mac? Why not set it up so your Apple Watch can unlock your Mac. Face Gallery You can't create your own custom watch faces, sadly, you can customise the existing ones with your iPhone. Previously you were only able to do this on the watch itself, but the bigger screen makes it easier. Find my Apple Watch The Find My iPhone feature is now available on the Apple Watch, meaning if you lose your watch you can track it through Find My iPhone. Siri Siri has received a small update, where a haptic tap is now felt when Siri is no longer active. We would have liked a bigger updated for Siri on watchOS 3, but we will have to wait for a later revision. Camera controls You can now use the Digital Crown to control the iPhone's digital zoom levels. It's not quite the full customisation of the Digital Crown we were hoping for, but having the ability to zoom in photos is good nevertheless. OUR VERDICT watchOS 3 brings a number of improvements to the Apple Watch that we welcome, with Instant Apps being our personal favourite. We've been reluctant to use Apple Watch apps thus far as they've taken a while to load (so long that we could get our iPhones out and check!), but the introduction of watchOS 3 means that many apps now load instantly. It's a huge improvement over watchOS 2, and we can't wait to find out what Apple has in store for watchOS 4! Tags: Apple , iWatch Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Google Calendar finally comes to the iPad Blair Hanley Frank 30 March, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News Google’s Calendar app is making a long-awaited move to a new device: Apple’s iPad. You read that right: Until Wednesday, the tech titan hadn’t optimized its marquee calendar application to run on Apple’s tablets. The app provides users with a view of the calendars that they have and that are shared with them through Google’s service. In addition, they get a handful of features Apple’s native calendar app doesn’t have, like the ability to more easily find time and space for a meeting with other people inside their organizations. Making iPad users wait for a native Calendar app is hardly a surprise coming from Google, considering that it’s the company behind Android, and frequently ships new features first to apps for devices running its mobile operating system. That’s not to say Google Calendar was completely unavailable for iPad users for the past several years. The iPhone app for Calendar could run on Apple’s tablets, but it wasn’t optimized for use on those devices. The move is a part of Google’s continuing push to make its G Suite productivity services useful to as broad a set of people as possible. Google is working aggressively to get customers to switch to its productivity suite from their current systems, which in many cases, revolve around Microsoft Office. Microsoft offers its own calendar app for the iPad in the form of Outlook for iOS, which has supported Apple’s tablet since its launch in 2015. Google has more iOS-specific features planned, including a Today widget that will let users see their upcoming events in an iPad’s Notification Center, according to a blog post by Calendar product manager Sharon Stovezky.

The other models have been out for a while, but the most anticipated device, the Samsung Galaxy S8, has just been announced and it is a perfect time to see what kind of job Samsung did to try to stay ahead of the competition. The Google Pixel XL is Google’s first attempt at breaking away from their old Nexus moniker, and it was designed and built from the ground up as an entirely new device to be part of Google’s ecosystem. The LG G6 is also a total revamp of LG’s poor selling LG G5 – gone is the all-metal painted body, modular configuration, and in is an all-glass backing. The Apple iPhone 7 is an evolution of their previous iPhone 6S and offers the same all-metal body construction with internal improvements. The Samsung Galaxy S8 is also a brand new phone, and while it continues with its all-glass backing, it looks nothing like its processor – gone is the flat display, and now Samsung is using its dual curved display on all models with the tiniest of bezels. Let us take a look and see which one of these devices deserves your special attention. Specifications Design When we get to this high-end of a smartphone, we are looking at designs that tend to use either all-metal or all-glass for outside materials. All of these devices look and feel like a premium device, although the Samsung Galaxy S8 would probably win for sexiest design and it comes bearing the most features. The new Samsung Galaxy S8 is staying with an all-glass design, but the entire device looks completely different. It has a dual-curved display with very small bezels top and bottom, and gone is the home button on the front, and the fingerprint sensor is now located in the back, next to the camera. The display jumps from 5.1-inches to 5.8-inches, and it is one of the first devices to use the new Snapdragon 835 processor. The Google Pixel XL, and its smaller brother, the Google Pixel, have a combination of polished glass and metal on the back, although the front is typical looking with a wide bezel across the top and bottom even though their fingerprint sensor is on the back. It has water splash resistance to it and a non-removable battery. The new LG G6 went to an all-glass design this year, which added an IP68 certification and wireless charging but also did away with LG’s trump card, a removable battery. The display increased as did the battery size. The dual primary cameras changed sizes on the LG G6, and the front-facing camera (FFC) got smaller. The Apple iPhone 7 looks similar to its predecessor with only modest tweaking of certain areas. The antenna bands are now moved from the back to the edges for a cleaner look, and a dual camera was added to only the Plus model. Apple has done away with its physical home button, although it is still located where the home button was previously and is now a touch button. It is IP67 certified and still retains its non-removable battery. Display The displays on the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus are much larger than their predecessors are and now sport a 5.8-inch screen (up from 5.1-inch) and a 6.3-inch display (up from a 5.7-inch). Both displays use the dual-curved design, Super AMOLED technology, Quad HD resolution of 2960 x 1440 pixels and 568 pixels-per-inch (PPI) on the Galaxy S8 with an 18:9 ratio. It keeps the always-on display, Gorilla Glass 5, and adds 3D Touch. The display on the Google Pixel XL starts out with a 5.5-inch Quad HD AMOLED display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels and 534 PPI. Google did not give the Pixels any special functions like always-on, and protection is from Gorilla Glass 4. LG sticks with their IPS LCD technology, with the display measuring in at a larger 5.7-inches versus the 5.3-inch of the LG G5. It retains its Quad HD resolution of 2880 x 1440 pixels and 564 PPI using an 18:9 (2-to-1 ratio). It uses the always-on technology, includes Dolby Vision, and Gorilla Glass 3 protects the display. The display on the iPhone 7 is only 4.7-inches, and it uses an LED-backlit IPS LCD affair with an HD resolution of 1334 x 750 pixels and 326 pixels-per-inch (PPI), or as Apple likes to call it, Retina Display. It features Apple’s 3D Touch from last year, Display Zoom, and Ion-strengthened glass. Processor/Memory This comparison has an array of processors that range from the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 to the newer Snapdragon 835 to the Exynos 8895 to the A10 Fusion chip used in the only non-Android device, the Apple iPhone 7. The US version of the Galaxy S8 uses the newest Snapdragon 835 octa-core clocked at 2.45GHz with an Adreno 540 GPU while the international version uses the Samsung Exynos 8895 processor. They both come with 4GB of DDR4 RAM and 64GB/128GB of expandable memory. The Google Pixel and Pixel XL both come with a Snapdragon 821 quad-core processor clocked at 2.15GHz with an Adreno 530 GPU. They both pack 4GB of DDR4 RAM and offer 32GB or 128GB of non-expandable memory. Qualcomm claims that the 821 gives a 10-percent increase in power when compared to the 820. The LG G6 uses the Snapdragon 821 octa-core processor clocked at 2.35GHz and an Adreno 530 GPU along with 4GB of DDR4 RAM and 32GB/64GB of expandable storage. The iPhone 7 uses Apple’s new A10 Fusion quad-core chip clocked at 2.34GHz with 2GB of RAM and either 32GB, 128GB, or 256GB of non-expandable internal memory. Camera Area Smartphone cameras are nothing as they were in flip-phones – they are our go-to camera for any occasion – birthday parties, for a get-together, or even for something as important as a wedding. The front-facing cameras (FFC) have expanded our use of selfies and video chatting. The smartphone cameras have become so good that the old point-and-shoot cameras are a dying commodity. The Samsung Galaxy S8 uses the same great camera found on the Galaxy S7 – a new Dual-Pixel 12MP primary camera with a large f/1.7 aperture, quick phase detection autofocus (PDAF), OIS, auto HDR and an LED flash. It uses a new and larger 8MP, f/1.7, 26mm wide-angle and auto HDR for its FFC. The two new Google Pixel and Pixel XL both use the same 12.3MP sensor, f/2.0 aperture, PDAF, and a dual-tone flash as well as a large 8MP FFC with a f/2.4 and 1080p capabilities. The LG G6 uses a dual setup for its primary camera and a change from last year when the LG G5 had a 16MP and an 8MP wide-angle lens. The new LG G6 uses two 13MP lenses, with PDAF, OIS and dual-tone LED flash. It uses a smaller 5MP with a f/2.2 aperture for its FFC. The Apple iPhone 7 uses a new 12MP sensor with a f/2.2, PDAF, Quad-LED True Tone flash, and OIS for its primary camera and a 7MP FFC with the f/2.2. Battery All of the devices this time around are leaning toward the trend of a non-removable battery, including one of the last holdouts, LG. It is much easier for a manufacturer to give us IP68 water and dust protection and wireless charging with a non-removable battery. Now that most of the smartphones offer a quick charge option of some sort, the need to replace a battery, though nice, is becoming less of a necessity. The Apple iPhone begins with the smallest battery at 1,960 mAh with no fast charge capabilities. The Samsung Galaxy S8 has a relatively small battery at 3,000 mAh but comes with Quick Charge as well as Quick Wireless Charging. The LG G6 packs in a 3,300 mAh battery with Quick Charge and Wireless Charging capabilities, while the Google Pixel XL also has the largest battery at 3,450 mAh battery with fast charge capabilities. Features/Observations The Samsung Galaxy S8 measures 140.1 x 72.2 x 7.3 mm, is the only one of the group that has a dual curved edge display, and is the only device in the group that offers Samsung Pay as an option. The Galaxy S8 also has a heart rate and oxygen saturation sensor, iris scanner, always-on feature, 3D Touch, and a new rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. Samsung even threw in some Hi-Res audio. The Google Pixel XL measures 154.7 x 75.7 x 8.5 mm and weighs in at 168 grams. It comes running Android 7.1 Nougat right from the box. You will have a choice of Really Blue, Very Silver, or Quite Black. It comes with Google Assistant built into the device. The LG G6 uses a dual setup for its primary camera – two 13MP lens with the second one being for wide-angle use. It now uses an 18:9 display ratio that is Dolby Vision certified and uses an always-on display to save battery life. It incorporates Hi-Res audio and includes wireless charging and Google Assistant. It measures 148.9 x 71.9 x 7.9 mm and weighs in at 163 grams. The new Apple iPhone 7 comes with a few refinements – most of the good stuff is only on the iPhone 7 Plus. It has a new quad-LED flash, improved 3D Touch, improved stereo sound, IP67 dust and water resistance, and 2GB of RAM with non-expandable 32GB of memory now being the smallest option available. Starting the trend of removing the headphone jack, you will not find one on this iPhone, but Apple supplied a lightning adapter. It measures 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm and weighs in at 138 grams. Pricing starts out at $769 for the 32GB model. While it has NFC, it can only be used for Apple Pay. The Final Word This has been a quick comparison, looking at a few of the top smartphones available today. The Apple iPhone was thrown into the mix to see how it held up against some of best Android has to offer. There are no speed tests here, as both iOS and Android Nougat operate quickly and smoothly in everyday use. We compared only the design and features that these phones offer when compared to one another. The most striking difference between the iPhone and the Android devices has to be iOS versus Android 7.0 Nougat. The battle wages on, but after spending a day with both operating systems, most people will agree that the Android OS allows the user a lot more flexibility and power in its design and the ability to customize the display to look the way you want it to look, and the placement and use of widgets on the displays. iOS is a great OS if you want to follow Apple’s more restrictive design, but for many of us, that is just not enough. We like to make our smartphone’s our own personalized device and Android allows you to accomplish that goal. The Google Pixel and Pixel XL were released in October 2016 and are the oldest of the Android smartphones compared. The LG G6 is just arriving on the scene, and the newest Samsung Galaxy S8 has just been announced as of this morning and has an expected arrival date of April 21st. Other than being the first smartphone to arrive with Google Assistant baked in, the Google Pixel XL is a solid smartphone but is expensive for the features you get. Although it is an AMOLED display, it is the smallest of the three, and there is no IP68 certification, no memory expansion, and no wireless charging. The LG G6 has a few more features and a larger display with Dolby Vision, albeit of the LCD variety. You do get an IP68 certification, the always-on display, memory expansion, dual cameras, Hi-Res audio, and wireless charging. The LG G6 does use the same Snapdragon 821 processor found in the Google Pixel XL, which means it is from 2016. The Samsung Galaxy S8 offers the largest dual-curved display, the newest Snapdragon 835 processor, IP68 certification, always-on display, 3D Touch, Hi-Res audio, an iris scanner, heart rate monitor, Oxygen Saturation sensor, quick wireless charging, and Samsung Pay. All three of these flagship Android smartphones offer something a little bit different. The Google Pixel XL will get the fastest software updates and carries Google Assistant, while the LG G6 offers a larger, always-on display, dual cameras, wireless charging, and Google Assistant. The Samsung Galaxy S8 offers a dual curved display, the largest display with Super AMOLED and always-on feature, the best processor/GPU of the group, wireless charging, Samsung Pay, heart and oxygen sensors, and iris scanner. It is up to you to pick the features and the price you can afford – all three devices should satisfy your needs.

Originally, the promotion was set to run through the end of the year, but Apple extended it through March 31st to supplement the launch of the LG UltraFine 5K displays, which are also discounted. That day is quickly approaching, though, so you’re running out of time to take advantage of the promo… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Come this Friday, March 31st, USB-C accessories sold through Apple will return to their original prices. The rare promotion from Apple has now been in effect for around 5 months, so we wouldn’t expect Apple to further extend the window. As a refresher, here are the accessories you can get from Apple at a lower price through Friday: USB-C to USB Adapter ($19 → $9) Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter ($49 → $29) USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter ($69 → $49) USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter ($69 → $49) USB-C to Lightning (1 m) ($25 → $19) USB-C Charge Cable (2 m) ($19) USB-C to Lightning (2 m) ($35 → $29) 29W USB-C Power Adapter ($49) 61W USB-C Power Adapter ($69) 87W USB-C Power Adapter ($79) While charging accessories are not dropping in price, Apple is discounting third-party USB-C accessories sold through its retail channels, including SanDisk’s $49 USB-C SD card reader which drops to $29. Additionally, the price cuts on LG’s UltraFine displays are also over at the end of this week. Apple implemented this promotion to ease the transition from USB-A to USB-C with the launch of the new MacBook Pro lineup and accompanying LG UltraFine displays. Now that USB-C has been the standard for a few months now, however, it makes sense for Apple to let the promotion lapse. Head to Apple’s website to take advantage of the deals. If you’re reading this after March 31st has already passed, you can check Amazon for some affordable USB-C accessories.

Clips, which will hit Apple's App Store in April, lets customers take videos and add animated captions and titles, complete with colourful emoji symbols. The app also makes it possible to stitch together multiple video clips and add speech bubbles and filters. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The battle between messaging platforms is heating up. Photo: iStock The functions closely resemble those that drive Snap's wildly popular Stories feature. With Stories, Snap users string together photos and videos, embellish them and then post them to their feeds. Apple's new Clips lets users post their video to Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo and more. But if users post them to Apple's own Messages app, Apple will recommend whom to share it with based on which friends are in the videos and whom the user frequently contacts – the kind of predictive social features Facebook excels at. Apple has a huge number of users for Messages, the flagship app for short notes that is built into the iPhone's iOS 10 software. Apple does not say how many people use the app, but it does say that there more than one billion iOS devices on the market and that 79 per cent of them run iOS 10. Apple also says that Messages is the most commonly used app on iOS devices, giving the company potentially up to 800 million users for its latest messaging platform. Snap, by contrast, has 161 million daily active users. While Apple's Clips competitor will technically be a separate app from Messages, it will be tied closely to it for the ability to share Clips videos with other Apple users. Facebook has more than one billion users for both Messenger, which was split off from the main Facebook service in 2014, and for WhatsApp, which it acquired in a multibillion-dollar deal the same year.

Top News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter App International Edition Thursday March 30, 2017 About Us Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Taiwan Foreign Community National Local Foreign Affairs China-Taiwan Relations Business Arts-Leisure Analysis Where to find the best offers for the e-payment service By Christine Chou, The China Post  Thursday, March 30, 2017, 12:02 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet A- A+ 中文 TAIPEI, Taiwan -- As Apple Pay became available to users in Taiwan from 7 a.m. this morning, local banks offering the e-payment service have rolled out promotional events for every purchase their cardholders make using the service. Seven banks in Taiwan — Taishin International Bank (台新銀行), Taipei Fubon Bank (台北富邦銀行), Standard Chartered Bank (渣打銀行), Cathay United Bank (國泰世華), CTBC Bank (中國信託), E.SUN Bank (玉山銀行), and Union Bank of Taiwan (聯邦銀行) — have signed up to allow their cards to be used via Apple Pay. 　　Apple users with an Apple Watch, iPad or an iPhone 6 or newer are now able to use their cards from any of these banks to pay at select stores that have a contactless point-of-sale terminal. 　　Coffee lovers are in luck if you use the Apple Pay service through Cathay United Bank, which treats card holders with discounts for Starbucks and Cama Cafe. 　　Businesses such as the Breeze Center (微風廣場), Far Eastern Department Store (遠東百貨), SOGO (太平洋百貨), Carrefour (家樂福) and PXMart (全聯福利中心) are also being quick to capitalize on Apple Pay's launch. Breeze is offering users of its co-branded card with Union Bank who make a purchase of at least NT$399 on any Thursday of the month a NT$100 coupon. 　　Apple first announced its plans to launch its e-wallet app in February, making Taiwan the 14th market in which the service has been launched.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Macs and iPhones patched – including 23 kernel-level holes 29 Mar 2017 3 Post navigation Previous: News in brief: Hong Kong voters’ data lost; Rudd faces pushback; Google Home lands in Britain Next: Lawmakers scathing over FBI’s facial recognition database by Paul Ducklin 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Apple’ latest batch of updates is out, including macOS Sierra 10.12.4 and iOS 10.3. There’s also an update to Safari 10.1, installed automatically if you update Sierra, but provided as a separate download for OS X El Capitan (10.11) and OS X Yosemite (10.10), which get Security Update 2017-001 rather than a full-on point release. Lastly, the iWork suite, consisting of Pages, Keynote and Numbers (Apple’s equivalent of Word, Powerpoint and Excel), were updated too. The iWork updates were mainly about form and function, but also included a security patch dealing with an intriguing vulnerability, about which more later. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More Importantly, the iOS and macOS updates close a number of security holes revealed at the recent Pwn2Own contest held alongside the CanSecWest conference in Vancouver, Canada. All software on the target computer is patched immediately before the contest, so even an attack that worked fine in the lab the week before might end up stymied on competition day In other words, Pwn2Own isn’t just about spotting vulnerabilities that might be exploitable, but also about exploring exploitation techniques to come up with genuine zero-day security holes that will work even on properly-updated systems. Prizes run to hundreds of thousands of dollars each. Not everyone approves of the competitive “winner-takes-all” approach, in which vulnerabilities may be kept secret for weeks or even months until showtime arrives. But whether you like it or not, high-stakes bug bounty contests like Pwn2Own have become part of today’s responsible disclosure scene. The “responsibility” comes from the fact that to claim the prize, the bug finders have to give the affected vendor full details of the attack and keep those details confidential until the vendor has had time to fix the hole. The high payout for many Pwn2Own bugs reflects that they would be similarly valuable if crooks were to find them instead, so fixes typically follow as quickly as is practicable. The TL;DR version of this story is this: as Apple patches go, treat these as “first among equals” and make sure you get them as soon as you can. If you wait for your turn to come around in Apple’s staggered autoupdate process, you might end up several days behind, so we recommend checking for updates manually right away. On a Mac, click on Apple Menu | About This Mac | Software Update… and then click on the blue “update arrow” in the App Store app. On an iPhone or iPad, use Settings | General | Software Update to make sure you have the latest version. When we updated, the download sizes were about 1.5GB for macOS 10.12.4 and 650MB for iOS 10.3. As is typical for Apple security updates, a restart was required, and the update completed over a 15 to 20 minute period as part the reboot, during which time we couldn’t use our Mac or our phone. Just so you know. If you’re still not convinced about the value of getting into the patch queue as early as you can, here are some statistics from Apple’s official Mac security announcement: 65 fixes listed.
127 CVE-numbered vulnerabilities listed.
23 fixes deal with arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges.
42 system components affected, from AppleGraphicsPowerManagement to tiffutil.
 Some of the vulnerabilities can be triggered by viewing booby-trapped files as diverse as images, fonts and iBooks files, all of which can be unexceptionably embedded in or linked to from otherwise innocent-looking web pages. And if that’s not enough, consider this one. We’ve written about Thunderbolt-related memory probing and firmware hacks before; this time the flaw could theoretically allow an attacker with physical access to your Mac to find your hard disk decryption password in memory: Component:     EFI (macOS Sierra 10.12.3)
Impact:        A malicious Thunderbolt adapter may be able to 
               recover the FileVault 2 encryption password
Description:   An issue existed in the handling of DMA. 
               This issue was addressed by enabling VT-d in EFI.
CVE-2016-7585: Ulf Frisk (@UlfFrisk) One way to mitigate memory-probing attacks against your Mac, or any other computer for that matter, is to shut down your computer completely instead of relying on hibernation or sleep mode. When powered off, the decryption password is lost from RAM, so there’s nothing to recover until you’ve booted up and typed the password in again. Especially if you travel a lot, when you can’t guarantee to have your computer in sight and under your own control at all times, get into the habit of doing a full shutdown instead of simply closing the lid. It requires a bit more discipline, and takes longer than simply ‘sleeping’ and ‘unsleeping’ your computer, but it’s an orderly thing to do, and breaks the risky habit of leaving loads of applications alive with interesting documents open in them. Before we go… We mentioned a security patch for iWork at the top of the article. The iWork fix is small and simple, but nevertheless a serious reminder of how “forgotten history” can come back to bite us all. According to Apple, the password protection feature in the Export To PDF… option of the Numbers, Pages and Keynote apps could sometimes leave you with a 40-bit RC4-encrypted file, instead of the 128-bit AES encryption that today’s encrypted PDFs are expected to use. We’re guessing that this was a long-forgotten hangover from the days when the US regulated cryptographic exports as if they were munitions, requiring export versions of US software to use carefully weakened encryption versions so that US intelligence typically could crack selected files, but less well-funded adversaries couldn’t quite. Of course, 40-bit keys that were “just about” crackable by the NSA 20 years ago are crackable by everyday computer hardware now… …a reminder, given that the UK government this week called for deliberate cutbacks to the encryption strength used by services such as WhatsApp, that you can’t strengthen security by weakening it.

You need to wait a couple weeks until the bugs are fixed. If it was something like 10.2.9 or something small like that then do it. These bigger updates always have problems. Reply Paul Ducklin says: March 29, 2017 at 9:51 pm The words “need” and “always” deserve a bit of evidence, don’t you think? If you are saying that iOS major updates *always* have problems, you shouldn’t be short of examples, because you’re implying there are at least two problems every time. I’ve updated my iPhone 6+ the same day that each update came out since purchasing it just over two years ago. I have never experienced a “bug” that appeared as a side-effect of an update or had any reason to regret updating promptly… …but I’ve had the comfort of being ahead of almost everyone else, rather than lagging behind and still having bugs most other people have already fixed. In other words, I haven’t noticed updates that have introduced any bugs, but I’ve noticed many bugs squashed by updates. I guess, when it comes to patching, you either bite the bullet or hide from shadows. As we put it in one of our early Techknow podcasts: lead, follow or get out of the way :-) https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/07/18/sophos-techknow-patching-should-you-lead-follow-or-get-out-of-the-way/ Reply Kaczor says: March 30, 2017 at 1:05 am Paul Ducklin As common rule with those making claim of bugs like brianc6234 without backing claim. The response was unfounded from Brianc6234, obviously confused between Windows, Mac OS is different ball game, and only time I would agree is on Windows patch. Example, have Microsoft word 2010 student university, visio2013, accel2013, and project2013. Received some patches/updates for app’s, installed, and tried to use MS word, MS word starts giving unable create backup word file. Online fixes available were useless so contacted their forum and still no fix. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

According to a recent report published by mobile analytics firm Verto (via TechCrunch), Apple Music had 40.7 million unique monthly mobile users during February of 2017. Verto only tracks Apple Music usage on mobile devices, so Apple's unique monthly user number could be higher. Comparatively, streaming radio service Pandora had 32.6 million unique monthly users during February, while Spotify had 30.4 million. iHeartRadio saw the fourth highest number of monthly visitors on mobile at 28.5 million, while SoundCloud came in fifth with 25.7 million. For Spotify, Pandora, iHeart Radio, and SoundCloud, mobile and PC visits are counted. According to Verto, which gathers its data from 20,000 users in the UK and US and then pairs it with analytics information, Apple Music has the most monthly unique users due to the three-month free trial the company offers, which doubles the number of people that are using the Apple Music app in the United States. Click to enlarge Apple has long offered three months of free music streaming when a user first signs up for Apple Music, two months longer than the trial period offered by Spotify. As of December 2016, Apple Music has more than 20 million paid subscribers, a number that's been growing steadily since the service launched in 2015. Spotify, meanwhile, reached 50 million paying subscribers earlier this month. Despite its lead over Apple Music, Spotify is taking cues from Apple. Earlier today, Spotify announced plans to debut an original show called "Traffic Jams," a copy of the "Carpool Karaoke" show Apple plans to launch on Apple Music. Similar to Carpool Karaoke, in which celebrities and musicians will sing hit songs while in a car, Traffic Jams pairs well-known hip-hop producers and rappers, challenging them to produce a track in the backseat of a car.

I like how they threw "Beats" in the title of the article. ;) Rating: 5 Votes dmylrea 6 hours ago at 05:50 pm WOW! Surprising that more first time people came for a free service than a paid one. The sign of how good the service is is by how many people are willing to PAY for it, and SPOTIFY wins. Gotta love these headlines.

Rating: 2 Votes chafey 4 hours ago at 07:42 pm I don't understand why apple's music app is so bad. I tried to be a good fanboy but it just sucks compared to Spotify. Odd timing - today I cancelled my Apple Music sub and activated Spotify premium. Rating: 2 Votes bollman 3 hours ago at 09:02 pm I find all this very interesting. 35 years ago I listened to LPs, and radio 25 years ago I listened to CDs, and radio 20 years ago I listened to MP3s from Napster, and no radio 10 years ago I listened to podcasts and no radio Today, I mostly listen to radio, via internet. I have a Spotify family account, but I haven't started Spotify in months. I don't think I would miss it, really. And Apple Music is so far from what I would want it's not even relevant. I'm fed up with choices and playlists. I like curated music, well done, very well done. Public Service Radio, that's where it's at. Rating: 2 Votes ani4ani 5 hours ago at 07:34 pm Did I read that right? Only 60% of spotify users actually use the service in a given month? On mobile devices...and since Spotify is available on way more non-mobile devices another headline would be easy to write about how few folks use AM on non-mobile.

I just broke free of iTunes. I'm testing out a combination of Swinsian for music library management and Google Music Unlimited. I maintain a large library and still buy lots of music. Unfortunately Apple Music really isn't geared for people like me. iCloud Music Library drives me nuts. I'm not a Google fan generally speaking but I like their music UI much better. Now I can maintain my library of purchased music on my machine and have access to that entire library plus anything in Google on all my devices. I don't want iCloud messing with my library. And Swinsian is so quick and responsive compared to that slug iTunes.

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube It has been something of an open secret that Apple is interested in getting into the video game, and that’s what they kind of did when they acquired the rights to the Carpool Karaoke series and made it part of Apple Music. Turns out that Spotify isn’t going to take that lying down because in a report from Variety, they have launched their answer in the form of “Traffic Jams”. The concept of Traffic Jams appears to be similar to Carpool Karaoke where it will be filmed inside of a car. However unlike Carpool Karaoke which features a variety of artists and celebrities in general, Traffic Jams appears to be focused more towards hip-hop fans as it will feature well-known hip-hop producers as well as rappers, with the goal being to challenge these producers and rappers to put together a track in the backseat of a car while being driven around. The first episode of Traffic Jams is expected to debut on the 4th of April on Spotify, with the debut episode featuring the likes of T-Pain and Southside. Both these celebrities will be tasked to produce a track in the car while being driven around by comedian DoBoy, and ultimately they will have to perform it in front of a live audience at the end of the show. It sounds like a very interesting concept, especially if you’re a fan of hip-hop and would love to see how your favorite rappers and producers come up with songs. In the meantime you can check out the show’s trailer in the video above. Filed in Audio >General. Read more about apple music, Entertainment, Music and Spotify.

They thought it would be an ideal time to rank the most popular music streaming sites and apps, considering Spotify's potential IPO, Pandora's launch of a Premium subscription service, and Tidal's second birthday. In the end Apple came out on top.   The Verto Index report notes that "Apple Music is the top music streaming service on our Index, with nearly 41 million monthly unique users reported in February (on mobile devices only). Even without taking PC audiences into account, it's still the reigning music streaming service, with 20% more monthly unique users than Pandora (32.6 million monthly unique users) or Spotify (30.4 million monthly unique users)."

In his tweet, Durov wrote: Apple, a company worth 750B+ and employing 115K+ people, needs weeks to review a simple @telegram update. Mismanagement? @tim_cook — Pavel Durov (@durov) March 29, 2017 No reason has been given by Apple as to why the review process is taking so long, according to some estimations, iOS apps are, on average, only put under review for two days. The delay could be Apple having second thoughts about pushing the update given that it is a direct competitor to its own iMessage, but this scenario is unlikely. Telegram has been testing out voice calling functionality for a few weeks now, allowing anyone to hop onto an alternative network using the beta application. Users can either allow everyone to call them, permit calls only from those on their contact lists, or simply block all incoming calls. There is also an option for blocking individual users from calling.

Minyanville Postponing the conference call PLUS Amazon vs Google By Scutify Mar 29, 2017 12:51 pm PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. I'm afraid I just don't feel up to doing the call after all. I can't hardly talk without catching a coughing fit, so let's postpone the Q&A conference call until tomorrow at 2pm ET. In the meantime, we edited some of last week's Q&A transcript down and made into an article for Marketwatch: These days, Google versus Amazon is a bigger story than Google versus Apple. And Amazon might have more long-term upside than either Google or Apple. But I continue to hold all three. Here's why. Google GOOG, +1.00% is down from its recent all-time highs, but so is the broader market. I am surprised the stock hasn't been hit more than it has, as Google's headlines for the past week have been dominated by Google and its struggles with advertisers. A lot of big advertisers, from Verizon VZ, -0.45% to AT&T T, -0.05% here in the United States, to others in Europe and the rest of the world are frustrated with Google showing advertisements on what is perceived as hate or terrorist-related videos. Frankly, I am shocked that Google is still having that problem. I remember when YouTube was launched 12 years ago, and the company had so many problems with copyright content being uploaded, and major media companies were coming down hard on Google after it subsequently bought YouTube. Within weeks Google had software that was able to root out all that copyrighted content. Here we are 12 years later and Google's entire business model and cash flow rests on ads and ad networks, and this same issue apparently has not been solved. They are still having issues with ads being shown on places they shouldn't be. Just last week, I trimmed my long-held Alphabet. Alphabet could catch a doghouse effect for a while. You know, the pendulum swings back and forth, and right now it's looking like it could be swinging against Google. What the market is willing to pay for Google's earnings is bigger than what it will for Apple's AAPL, -0.07% earnings, but for now that multiple might contract for Google and expand for Apple. We have seen that kind of interplay between those two stocks over the years. But I continue to hold a core position, as I have since its IPO, because in the grand scheme of things, Google is very much about Android and the internet of things. Google browsers, self-driving cars, other ventures and search ads are all part of it too, of course. The biggest threat to Google isn't Apple. On the ad and search side and the Android side, the biggest threat is Amazon AMZN, +1.71% and its Alexa device, as I've talked about during the past few months. Amazon is one of our biggest holdings. In coming years, we'll all be talking to our smartphones and asking questions rather than typing in queries. Likewise, I expect Amazon to try another shot at the smartphone game, using an Android operating system, but Amazon will have built the smartphone from the ground up to be Alexa-centric. The Amazon world has become its own ecosystem from Alexa, to Amazon.com to the Amazon App. The consumer side of Amazon is stealing a playbook from the Apple ecosystem concept. The Amazon ecosystem is in the very early stages. The upshot is that I think you want to continue to own both Google and Amazon for the long term. But I think there's more upside potential in Amazon. In fact, I think Amazon could be another dark horse that ends up being the first trillion-dollar company. (It's now worth $403 billion.) I continue to hold both Amazon and Google in my personal portfolio. P.S.: On May 17, I'll be giving my talk "Flip It: You're Doing It All Wrong" at the Las Vegas Money Show. Click here to register.

Amber Rudd warned that internet companies are acting as a 'conduit' for terrorists by failing to block extremist content Khalid Masood used a hired car to mow down dozens of pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before entering the grounds of Parliament and stabbing Pc Keith Palmer to death. MailOnline has revealed he was on WhatsApp minutes before the attack started Despite the company's flagship iPhone coming with an encrypted messaging service built in - iMessage - bosses will not be at the summit, according to The Times.   The row has intensified in the wake of the deadly attack on Westminster last week, when Masood used a hired car to mow down dozens of pedestrians before stabbing a policeman to death at the gates of parliament. MailOnline has revealed that the terrorist was on WhatsApp just minutes before he launched his deadly assault. As the service uses 'end to end encryption', not even the Facebook-owned company was able to read what was said. It is unclear whether police have been able to retrieve the records from Masood's phone. The killer is believed to have used an iPhone, and even if the authorities retrieved the handset they may not be able to crack the security. However, the end-to-end encryption on the application means it is extremely difficult for security services to trace.  Asked about the ability of terrorists to communicate secretly using the technology, Ms Rudd told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: 'It is completely unacceptable, there should be no place for terrorists to hide. 'We need to make sure that organisations like WhatsApp, and there are plenty of others like that, don't provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other.

Share this article Share 'It used to be that people would steam-open envelopes or just listen in on phones when they wanted to find out what people were doing, legally, through warrantry. 'But on this situation we need to make sure that our intelligence services have the ability to get into situations like encrypted WhatsApp.'  Mrs May raised questions about whether police had been able to see Masood's last messages, telling Sky News Sophy Ridge programme that 'this terrorist sent a Whatsapp message and it can't be accessed'. WHAT IS END-TO-END ENCRYPTION?  WhatsApp boasts that even it does not know what is being communicated between users. That is because it employs end-to-end encryption, where only linked phones have the matching security keys allowing them to decode messages. The technology has raised alarm because government agencies are completely unable to intercept conversations that may allow them to head off terror attacks. Obtaining a warrant against companies using the technology would be pointless, as they simply do not hold the information.  WhatsApp tells its users: 'Messages you send to this chat and calls are now secured with end-to-end encryption, which means WhatsApp and third parties can't read or listen to them.'    Supporters of end-to-end encryption say it has made day-to-day activities such as online shopping infinitely safer. But there are growing calls for providers to install a 'back door' in the systems so the authorities can access potentially life-and-death material. Asked if she opposed end-to-end encryption, Ms Rudd said: 'End-to-end encryption has a place, cyber security is really important and getting it wrong costs the economy and costs people money. 'So I support end-to-end encryption, it has its place to play. 'But we also need to have a system whereby when the police have an investigation, where the security services have put forward a warrant signed off by the Home Secretary, we can get that information when a terrorist is involved.' She denied what she was describing was incompatible with end-to-end encryption, adding: 'I support end-to-end encryption as part of cybersecurity, for families, for banking, for businesses. It's important.  'But we can't have a situation where terrorists can talk to each other, where this terrorist sent a Whatsapp message and it can't be accessed.' The Home Office claimed Ms Rudd had been making a general point rather than referring to Masood's case specifically.  A WhatsApp spokesman said: 'We are horrified at the attack carried out in London earlier this week and are cooperating with law enforcement as they continue their investigations.'  Ms Rudd also insisted the likes of Google - which runs YouTube - and other smaller sites such as WordPress and Telgram must take more responsibility for blocking extremist material. Ms Rudd said she was calling in a 'fairly long list' of relevant organisations for a meeting on the issue this week, including social media platforms.  'What these companies have to realise is that they are now publishing companies, they are not technology companies, they are platforms and we need to make sure that that (hosting extremist material) stops,' she said. 'You are right, we will not resile from taking action if we need to do so.' But she went on: 'I would rather get a situation where we get all these people around the table agreeing to do it. 'I know it sounds a bit like we're stepping away from legislation but we're not. Pictured: Jihadist Khalid Masood, who left four dead and 29 injured after a rampage in Westminster 'What I'm saying is the best people who understand the technology, who understand the necessary hashtags to stop this stuff even being put up, not just taking it down, but stopping it being put up in the first place, are going to be them.' Boris Johnson also stepped up the pressure on internet firms over their 'disgusting' failure to block extremist content. Before the atrocity Google had already been forced to promise it would take a 'tougher stance' on hateful content after an outcry and boycotts from advertisers over its content appearing alongside extreme material.  Mr Johnson called on internet providers and social media companies to develop new technology to detect and remove jihadist and other extreme material. He accused them of 'not acting when they are tipped off', adding in an interview with the Sunday Times: 'I'm furious about it. 'It's disgusting. 'They need to stop just making money out of prurient violent material.' Ms Rudd demanded more cooperation from internet and tech firms as she appeared on the  BBC's Andrew Marr show today Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he found it 'disgusting' that net firms were not taking tougher action against extreme literature  Masood was seemingly using WhatsApp just minutes before he went on his murder rampage Mr Johnson added: 'They are not acting when they are tipped off. 'Evil flourishes when good men do nothing - and that's what's happening here. 'They are putting up adverts next to it.' Europol, the EU's law enforcement agency, backed Ms Rudd's call for messaging services to build back doors into end-to-end encryption. Its director Rob Wainwright told BBC Sunday Politics: 'There is no doubt that encryption, encrypted communications are becoming a more and more prominent feature in the way that terrorists communicate, more and more of a problem therefore, a real challenge for investigators. 'And at the heart of this is a stark inconsistency between the ability of the police to lawfully intercept telephone calls but not when those messages are exchanged by a social media messaging board for example.  Theresa May vowed to show terrorists that 'we are not afraid' as she addressed the House of Commons in the wake of the attack 'That's an inconsistency in society, it surely is, and we have to find a solution through the appropriate legislation, through perhaps the technology companies and law enforcement working maybe in a slightly more constructive way.' Commons Home Affairs Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper said the Government should consider German-style laws to fine companies that fail to remove extreme material, although Ms Rudd distanced herself from the idea. Ms Cooper told Sky News's Sophy Ridge on Sunday: 'I think we're going to have to have much more pressure on them to act because I know that Amber Rudd wants to have another summit with them and another meeting with them. I'm sure that's very good. 'But David Cameron had lots and lots of meetings with them that kind of went around these issues again and again. 'I think they have to act.'

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Apple Music Has More Active Monthly Users Than The Competition By Tyler Lee on 03/29/2017 16:22 PDT It goes without saying that Spotify is the king of music streaming as last we heard, the company was boasting 50 million paid subscribers. This is compared to the competition such as Apple Music who last we checked had about 20 million subscribers, although we imagine those numbers have probably increased by now. That being said despite Apple Music being relatively new to the market and with Spotify dominating the music streaming scene, it turns out that Apple Music might actually be doing better in terms of active monthly users. This is according to recent stats published by Verto (via 9to5Mac) in which it was revealed that Apple Music has about 40.7 million unique users every month. This is versus the likes of Spotify who according to Verto, has about 30.4 million unique users a month. Interestingly enough Pandora Radio actually beats out Spotify in this regard with 32.6 million unique users. According to Verto, they told the folks at TechCrunch that the reason behind this is because of Apple Music’s free 3-month trial, which apparently manages to bring in more users, although we should note that Spotify also has a free listening tier if users would rather not pay. However we suppose the upside is that Apple Music comes bundled by default for Apple customers across multiple devices, thus saving them time from having to download a separate app which could encourage adoption.

Thursday 30 March 2017  | Comment Now Apple is facing its biggest test in education. What can the company do to fight back against the Chromebook? The education market has always been one in which Apple has had a strong presence. Dating back to the era of the Apple II, through the Mac and now into the iPad, the company's devices have always been contenders in schools and colleges. More recently the company has faced some major challenges. The rise of the Chromebook – simple, cloud-based and cheap – has given schools and colleges a new alternative to either Apple or Microsoft.   Apple's recent release of the latest, low-cost 9.7in iPad should be seen in this context. Although commentators have been quick to call the iPad a failure, it's worth remembering that according to figures from analyst Horace Dediu, it already has an overall installation base of around 300 million – double that of the Mac. Customer satisfaction scores for iPad are, as Apple CEO Tim Cook puts it, “through the roof”, hovering in the high 90s. And in schools and colleges, the iPad is Apple's key play against Chromebook. According to a report in The New York Times, the average selling price of a Chromebook into schools in the US is around $300 – which coincidentally happens to be where the latest iPad is priced. Technology's place in the classroom But Apple's focus in education is about much more than just the hardware. Too many times in the past, schools have “invested in technology” and ended up with devices that sit in the corner, boxed up, because either teachers don't know what to do with them or they have limited use. Apple's focus on education comes from the very top. Interestingly, Cook's focus is as much on teaching as tech, and he has referred to technology in the classroom as a “complement to traditional teaching and not a substitute”. “Technology has moved on considerably. It gets kids a lot more engaged because they're living in a digital world. We're all living in a digital world. This school has done an unbelievable job of integrating it.” Teaching the teachers The Apple Teacher Programme aims to ensure this doesn't happen by helping teachers understand how to integrate technology into the classroom more effectively. Apple Teacher is a self-paced online learning system that encourages teachers to develop their own skills, at their own pace, and it's designed from the ground up for education. But does it work? According to Cassey Williams, teacher and digital learning lead at the New Wave Federation: “Apple Teacher enables us to provide a way to train our teachers in a fun, collaborative way. We can use this each academic year as a specific program for newly qualified teachers or teachers new to our institution.” A place for coding The place of coding in the classroom is something that's occasionally controversial. Everyone agrees that understanding the role of code in our everyday lives is important. When everything you work on or play with involves some kind of code, literacy about how that works is as vital as a basic grasp of science. But all too often, we hear ministers and businesspeople demanding that kids learn to code simply in order to fill a perceived skills gap – as if children will leave school and instantly get jobs as programmers. The fact is that schools are simply not designed to churn out ready-made workers: if they were, they'd be teaching plumbing too. Apple's perspective is clearly that kids learning to code is important. To that end, the company has created Swift Playgrounds, an iPad app that takes you from knowing absolutely nothing about code to being able to create pretty complex programmes. Along the way it will teach you all the fundamentals of how code works, including conditionals, loops, and much more. Apple schools in the future All of this adds up to a great deal of commitment to education, even for a company with pockets as deep as Apple's. The key question is whether it can pay off, and whether schools will be persuaded to look away from the Chromebook in favour of the undoubtedly richer environment of the iPad. The release of the lower-cost iPad certainly improves Apple's chances, as it removes one objection to iPad adoption – price. In a sense, Chromebook versus iPad represents the clash of two different philosophies, both of which have roots in how children themselves use tech. On the one hand, the current generation of under-16s are the first true cloud natives, never knowing a world without the ability to do everything in a web browser. On the other hand, they're also the first generation for whom “there's an app for that” is true about everything. They've grown up with the smartphone – and smartphone-like devices like the iPad – as their main computing device. They expect the richness of the smartphone experience. Perhaps the biggest danger for Apple, though, is the Google ecosystem behind the Chromebook. Once a child has a Google account, that email address will follow them around for life – something that's an obvious advantage to Google. And while Apple might still be a presence in the classroom, it's less likely that parents will be able to afford Apple products at home, where Chromebooks start at the kind of prices most parents can afford. What's clear, though, is that Apple is still determined to make sure it has a place in schools. The Chromebook is a threat, but it's one that the company is determined to meet – and its focus on teaching the teachers and understanding of education may be the ace it needs to win.

Twitter Facebook Google Calendar finally comes to the iPad Yep, it took them this long Blair Hanley Frank (IDG News Service) 30 March, 2017 06:50 - - - - print email Comments Google’s Calendar app is making a long-awaited move to a new device: Apple’s iPad. You read that right: Until Wednesday, the tech titan hadn’t optimized its marquee calendar application to run on Apple’s tablets. The app provides users with a view of the calendars that they have and that are shared with them through Google’s service. In addition, they get a handful of features Apple’s native calendar app doesn’t have, like the ability to more easily find time and space for a meeting with other people inside their organizations. Making iPad users wait for a native Calendar app is hardly a surprise coming from Google, considering that it’s the company behind Android, and frequently ships new features first to apps for devices running its mobile operating system. That’s not to say Google Calendar was completely unavailable for iPad users for the past several years. The iPhone app for Calendar could run on Apple’s tablets, but it wasn’t optimized for use on those devices. The move is a part of Google’s continuing push to make its G Suite productivity services useful to as broad a set of people as possible. Google is working aggressively to get customers to switch to its productivity suite from their current systems, which in many cases, revolve around Microsoft Office. Microsoft offers its own calendar app for the iPad in the form of Outlook for iOS, which has supported Apple's tablet since its launch in 2015. Google has more iOS-specific features planned, including a Today widget that will let users see their upcoming events in an iPad’s Notification Center, according to a blog post by Calendar product manager Sharon Stovezky.

PDT March 28, 2017 Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak speaks at a the Digital Summit Seattle conference Tuesday. (Photo: KING) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak – who is often credited with inventing the modern personal computer – thinks it will probably be “a couple hundred years” before we have machines that can do everything and run the world. Wozniak (“Woz” to those in the tech world) covered a wide range of topics during a keynote Q&A at the Digital Summit Seattle conference Tuesday at McCaw Hall in Seattle. He talked about Steve Jobs, Dancing with the Stars, and what it’s like to have a wax mold made of you. On the issue of learning computers, he is "concerned” given how much we have already lost to automation and efficiency, noting how he had to give up a newspaper and a lot of other things that were “good.” “Economics tends to always win," Wozniak said. “That’s a real fear.” He cited the example of how, 200 years ago, people made the clothes we wear while today machines do. And those people had to move on to find other jobs. “I don’t worry about machines being the masters of us," he said. "I do worry about some level of jobs being lost, and we’re already there.” On the perception in pop culture of Steve Jobs as a maniacal, hard-driving businessman who wore his employees down, Wozniak didn’t disagree – or mince words. He acknowledged much of that perception is accurate, while also noting how influential the products that Jobs helped bring to life have been on our lives and culture. “He had a lot of negative things with his personal side,” Wozniak said. “A lot of things where, you would never raise your child to be that way. But he built a lot of great things. “Almost all the people who worked on the Macintosh group said they would not work with him again.” Wozniak said when he met Jobs at age 16, they were both fun-loving and free. But everything changed when they started building Apple and money – and history – became part of the equation. “He wanted to be an important person in history, and there was big money,” Wozniak said, and that changed his personality and drove the person he became.  When asked whether a young entrepreneur should follow a traditional path to earn a degree or join a high-risk startup company, Wozniak advised the latter route, saying education will always be there. “I created Apple with no college degree. Go with the startup. You can always go back to school,” said Wozniak, who eventually went back to school himself, using a made-up name to earn a degree from the University of California-Berkeley. The name on his diploma? Rocky Raccoon Clark. If you don't follow the inner workings of the tech and business world you may know Wozniak from Dancing with the Stars in 2009. He said it took the show’s producers a year to talk him into it, noting that he does not watch television and had no idea what the show was really all about. He said he was not used to moving his body that way – or really any way at all. He worked seven days a week for six hours a day to learn a 90-second routine. He fought through a broken toe and lost five inches on his belt size over the six weeks of training.   “Finally I got to a point where I could be happy with it,” Wozniak said. “I stood up and represented geeks in a way. “When you work hard at something and say I’m going to enjoy it, how lucky am I that I even got to do that?” Among his current passions is the Silicon Valley Comic Con, which brought in more revenue to San Jose in its first year than the Super Bowl. He is also speaking to as many high school and college students as he can, spreading his message to make the most of your youth. “I worked designing calculators during the day and went home at night and got to work on my ideas,” Wozniak said of the time in his career when he and Jobs started Apple. “When you’re young you can waste your free time or use it to pursue your ideas.” © 2017 KING-TV CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Livestream 4 Wife claims she shot protester at UW A stranger emailed me a warning about blood clots.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: REX/Shutterstock Trump’s Android phone has been repealed and replaced Zach Epstein @zacharye March 29th, 2017 at 9:12 AM Share Tweet Apple is a company known for many things, and class-leading gadgets is at the top of the list. The company’s iPod changed the way we listen to music, and the original iPhone turned the smartphone industry on its head, toppling giants like Nokia and BlackBerry in the process. Apple’s iPad marked the launch of a new multi-billion dollar product category, and the Apple Watch is the only smartwatch in the world that actually sells in any significant quantities. In fact, Apple is now the second largest watch maker in the world behind Rolex. Of course, Apple executives have also historically been known to make emphatic statements and then completely reverse course. “I don’t think it’s good that Apple is perceived as different; I don’t care about being different,” Apple co-founder Steve Jobs once said… just six months before the company’s famous Think Different campaign launched. And there are dozens of similar examples. Speaking of saying one thing and doing another, it looks like the president finally ditched his Android phone and switched to an iPhone. Don't Miss: Hidden changes in iOS 10.3 will give your iPhone a speed boost Just over one year ago, president Don Trump called upon all Americans to boycott Apple until the company agreed to help investigators unlock an iPhone tied to the tragedy in San Bernardino. “To think that Apple won’t allow us to get into her cellphone? Who do they think they are? No, we have to open it,” Trump said at the time, while being interviewed on Fox and Friends. “I agree 100% with the courts. In that case, we should open it up. I think security overall — we have to open it up. And we have to use our heads. We have to use common sense. Somebody the other day called me a ‘common-sense conservative.’ We have to use common sense. Our country has so many problems.” For those in need of a quick refresher, Apple refused to help unlock the phone and held firm on its stance. The company never unlocked the iPhone in question, but apparently Trump doesn’t care anymore because as of a couple of weeks ago, his Android phone has been repealed and replaced. Trump’s director of social media and senior advisor Dan Scavino Jr. confirmed the president’s change of heart in a tweet on Tuesday night. .@POTUS @realDonaldTrump has been using his new iPhone📱for the past couple of weeks here on Twitter.

By Emily Bary March 29, 2017 4:39 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large The new Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ screens have minimal bezels, or borders, so there's more screen space. Illustration: Samsung One thing Samsung doesn’t need: a hot new phone. Just months removed from its recall of exploding Galaxy Note tablets, the company unveiled its latest smartphone in New York on Wednesday. Our early impressions of the Galaxy S8: sleek and seemingly cool. This morning, at its “Unpacked” event, the company spoke about a number of new devices, including a Gear 360 camera and a touch-sensitive controller for the Gear VR headset. The focus, though, was on Samsung’s latest phones -- the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8+ -- which are due out April 21. We were able to try out the S8, and we liked it. Whether it’s enough to bring back defectors remains to be seen, but the latest Galaxy models one-up the current iPhones in a few key areas.

The company calls that its “infinity display.” Samsung aimed to minimize the amount of “bezel,” or border, by removing the physical home button and placing an “invisible” one behind the glass at the bottom of the screen -- basically the Samsung equivalent of Apple’s Force Touch. While the S8 is just a bit larger overall than the iPhone 7, it packs in more screen space. The fingerprint reader has been moved to the back of the phone in this redesign, which is awkward, but you don’t really need it. You can unlock the phone using facial recognition or iris scanning. Setting these features up was a cinch, as was unlocking the phone this way. The S8 and S8+ also have a fancy new virtual assistant named Bixby. She can send texts or open apps for you, as well as handle text- or touch-based commands, like identifying images in your photos and telling you where you can buy them. That part might not be so useful, but generally Bixby seems to grasp context better than Apple’s Siri. One other area where Samsung could be beating Apple to the punch: Its new phones will connect with desktop monitors, assuming you have a Samsung DeX, the company’s new Galaxy dock. (Apple recently filed a patent that would dock an iPhone in a laptop body.) At the big unveil, Samsung passed out handheld Gear 360 cameras and invited the audience to try them out together. The device was fine but nothing ground-breaking -- we still don’t see much use for taking handheld 360° videos. Samsung also talked up its new “motion-sensing” controller for the Gear VR headset. We didn’t get the chance to try this out, but it doesn’t seem like a controller will fix the underlying problem with VR as it stands -- the technology is still clunky and nausea-inducing.

Make your boss get you the smartphone brand recommended by PCMag readers. Smartphones, which have been kicking around for a decade, have gone from curiosity to compulsory for teens taking selfies, parents coordinating schedules, and those getting work done beyond email. Whether you take your personal handset to work or use your work smartphone at home, chances are there is a good amount of work happening on that small screen. We asked our readers during a recent survey to rate just how well their brand of smartphone does when it comes to completing work tasks. They rated the top brands available on the market today; those scoring the highest are spelled out below, but only one can be good enough to earn the Business Choice Award. You can be part of Business Choice! Sign up for the Readers' Choice Survey mailing list to receive invitations in the future. Looking for expert opinion? Read The Best Unlocked Phones of 2017. Smartphones for Work There are essentially three smartphone operating systems out there that anyone takes seriously (at least seriously enough to buy in any quantity high enough to make it into our survey results): Android, iOS, and Windows. Like last year, the results show that Apple's system—which is so tightly integrated with its iPhones that they're pretty much the same thing in this survey—is not up to snuff for work. The winner this year for Business Choice Smartphone is, once again, Google. Last year it was based entirely on its own line of phones under the Nexus brand; this year Google introduced two phones in the Pixel line and they've done nothing to dampen users' enthusiasm for them at work. Google again scores a 9.1 (on a 0 to 10 scale, with 10 as the best) for work satisfaction. Google phones are also tops when it comes to setup and likelihood to be recommended. If Google is lacking in any area, it's that a full one-fifth of business-case smartphone users needed to contact tech support—a higher percentage than any other in this survey. The runner up, like last year, is Microsoft's Windows phone OS. The company's desire to turn Windows into a universal OS isn't exactly burning up the charts in the everyday world, but obviously those who embrace a Windows phone for the office don't have a problem with it. Perhaps because once you've mastered Windows on a desktop, it's not hard to make that switch to the mobile world. Microsoft is neck and neck with Google on most of its scores, tying for work satisfaction and reliability (9.1 for each); Microsoft also had the lowest number of smartphones that needed repair (7 percent). It's hampered only by a lower likelihood to recommend score of 8.4, a number that ties with Motorola phones running Android, and which is behind even Apple. Microsoft also gets an expectedly dismal score when it comes to the availability of apps (5.9). Speaking of Moto and Apple, their work satisfaction scores are almost a full point behind Google/Microsoft. It's not typical to see Apple score such run-of-the-mill numbers among PCMag readers, but it's clear that when it comes to getting work done, the iPhone isn't cutting it. Apple didn't even score the best in availability of apps, a traditional stronghold due to the size of the Apple App Store. It earned a still respectable 8.9, but so did Moto. Google earned a 9.3 for app availability. Apple's work satisfaction score of 8.2 in fact puts it in the same range as Samsung and LG phones running Android. But our readers make it clear, if you're going to get an Android phone to do your work on, try to make it a Google Pixel or Pixel XL. See all of our survey results for work smartphones. WINNERS: SMARTPHONES FOR WORK Google Apple learned long ago that making your hardware and software work together makes them sing. Google has picked up on that with the Nexus and Pixel lines, and proven it can go Apple one better in the bargain: by being the best maker of handsets for businesses. Methodology We email survey invitations to PCMag.com community members, specifically subscribers to our Readers' Choice Survey mailing list. This survey was hosted by Equation Research, which also performs our data collection. This survey was in the field from February 21, 2017 through March 13, 2017. Respondents were asked to rate their smartphone using multiple questions about their overall satisfaction, as well as experiences with technical support within the past 12 months. Because the goal of the survey is to understand how the smartphones compare to one another and not how one respondent's experience compares to another's, we use the average of the rating, not the average of every respondent's rating. In all cases, the overall ratings are not based on averages of other scores in the table; they are based on answers to the question, "Overall, how satisfied are you with your smartphone for work?" Scores not represented as a percentage are on a scale of 0 to 10 where 10 is the best. Net Promoter Scores are based on the concept introduced by Fred Reichheld in his 2006 best seller, The Ultimate Question, that no other question can better define the loyalty of a company's customers than "how likely is it that you would recommend this company to a friend or colleague?" This measure of brand loyalty is calculated by taking the percent of respondents who answered 9 or 10 (promoters) and subtracting the percent who answered 0 through 6 (detractors).

Google’s Calendar app is making a long-awaited move to a new device: Apple’s iPad. You read that right: Until Wednesday, the tech titan hadn’t optimized its marquee calendar application to run on Apple’s tablets. The app provides users with a view of their calendars that are shared with them through Google’s service. In addition, they get a handful of features Apple’s native calendar app doesn’t have, like the ability to more easily find time and space for a meeting with other people inside their organizations. Making iPad users wait for a native Calendar app is hardly a surprise coming from Google, considering that it’s the company behind Android, and frequently ships new features first to apps for devices running its mobile operating system. That’s not to say Google Calendar was completely unavailable for iPad users for the past several years. The iPhone app for Calendar could run on Apple’s tablets, but it wasn’t optimized for use on those devices. The move is a part of Google’s continuing push to make its G Suite productivity services useful to as broad a set of people as possible. Google is working aggressively to get customers to switch to its productivity suite from their current systems, which in many cases, revolve around Microsoft Office. Microsoft offers its own calendar app for the iPad in the form of Outlook for iOS, which has supported Apple's tablet since its launch in 2015. Google has more iOS-specific features planned, including a Today widget that will let users see their upcoming events in an iPad’s Notification Center, according to a blog post by Calendar product manager Sharon Stovezky.

The new phones have quickly gotten high praise for their design as Samsung looks to come back from last year’s debacle over its Galaxy Note 7 phones. The company recalled the Note 7 after several reports of the phones exploding or catching fire. By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: March 29, 2017 at 2:27 pm | UPDATED: March 29, 2017 at 3:10 pm Top of the Order:   Hoping 8 is Great: Samsung debuted its new Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus smartphones Wednesday, and in the process showed it’s willing to take off the gloves and fight back after months of getting knocked to the canvas following the Galaxy Note 7 debacle. Samsung debuted the new S8 phones and left no doubt that the company wants to send a message to Apple that it means business. Both phones come with what Samsung calls its “Infinity Display,” a curved screen that takes up almost the entire front of the phone. The S8’s screen measures 5.8 inches, while the screen of the S8 Plus is 6.2 inches across. Related Articles Biz Break: Amazon ventures into the Middle East with Souq.com deal Biz Break: Oh, Snap!

An optional adapter lets the S8 dock with a display monitor and act like a PC running a modified version of the Android operating system. The phone also comes with a built-in digital assistant called Bixby. Samsung says that a person will eventually be able to use Bixby to run everything on the phone, but at least for now, Bixby just controls Samsung’s own apps and some of the S8’s functions. The S8 phones come with 64 gigabytes of built-in storage, but that can be expanded using MicroSD cards. Such an option isn’t available with the iPhone. It will take Samsung some time to overcome the embarrassment of the Note 7, which the company recalled after many reports of those phones exploding or catching fire. Whether Samsung can overtake the iPhone’s presence in the public mindset remains to be seen. But the company isn’t waiting around to see what Apple has planned for its next big iPhone update, which is likely to be in September. When that comes, Samsung may have five months of S8 success under its belt. Middle Innings: Block That App: Apple thinks there might be such a thing as too much information, at least when it comes to people getting news about U.S. military drone strikes. Apple yanked an app called Metadata+ from its App Store on Wednesday, only a few hours after giving the OK to the app. Metadata+ would send users a text report and map location when a drone attack took place. Apple had removed an earlier version of Metadata+ when it was under another name. Its developer kept submitting the app, and having it rejected, until finally getting it approved on Tuesday. And then Apple took it back down. Apple’s actions involving Metadata+ have again raised the question of just how the company determines what meets, and what goes against, its standards for making apps available on the App Store. Waze and Dunkin’ Together: There are only three Dunkin’ Donuts locations in the Bay Area, but the popular donut-store chain is early in its efforts to build up its presence in the region.

A new report from analytics firm Verto further highlights the sometimes underestimated reach of Apple Music. The report shows that Apple Music comes out on top in terms of monthly unique users, thanks in large part to the three-month free trial Apple offers. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case The data from Verto says that Apple Music attracted 40.7 million unique users during the month of February in the US, putting it well ahead of Pandora at 32.6 million unique users. Spotify rounded out the top three, coming in with 30.4 million unique users. Coming in fourth is iHeartRadio, while the struggling SoundCloud places fifth. These numbers include mobile users only, meaning they are likely higher if you take into account desktop. Vetro explained to TechCrunch that how Apple Music was able to bring in so many unique monthly users centers around the three-month free trial that Apple offers. The analytics firm says that the free trial more than doubles the amount of people who use Apple Music in the United States. This is an interesting tidbit of data for a number of reasons. For one, it really exemplifies just how big of a benefit Apple Music has by coming pre-installed on all iOS devices. Furthermore, it represents the potential for growth that Apple’s streaming music service still has. Most recently, Apple stated that Apple Music has “well past” 20 million paying subscribers worldwide. Today’s data from Verto claims that, in the US alone, Apple Music saw over 40 million unique users, presumably the majority of whom were free trial customers. Spotify, on the other hand, recently touted that it has 50 million paying subscribers worldwide, while it also has over 100 million users on its paid + free tiers combined. Nevertheless, Apple Music still outperformed Spotify in terms of active users in the United States. What this means for artists specifically is that if they’re looking for the best platform to go to with exclusive content, or content in general, Apple Music has the broadest reach. This is especially notable considering Apple pays artists during that three-month free trial. A lot has been made about the success of Apple Music and Beats 1, but information like this highlights how Apple’s large user base gives it an automatic leg-up compared to its competitors.

Maziar Rezakhani already lost his high-end penthouse and Ferrari collection for defrauding Apple and the Internal Revenue Service. This week, he learned his sentence. Rezakhani, 27, admitted to fraud related to a multimillion-dollar iPhone export operation. Pleading guilty in August, Rezakhani had been under investigation for nearly two years before federal agents came calling in October 2015. By then, though, the damage was done. Prosecutors say the young millionaire’s fraud helped break Foundation Bank of Bellevue, Wash., which loaned Rezakhani some of the millions he blew on Italian sports cars and his apartment. TOP BUSINESS VIDEOS: Story continues below | Breaking news first: Sign in for newsletters Investigators determined he had shipped thousands of Apple products to Dubai and elsewhere. By the prosecution’s account, Rezakhani tried to steal $700,000 worth of iPhones by claiming they were lost in the mail. He then obtained a $4 million loan on false pretenses and filed a false $5 million insurance claim. In sentencing Rezakhani, U.S. District Judge James Robart also imposed a five-year period of court supervision to begin after Rezakhani's release. Rezakhani began reselling Apple products while a student at the University of Washington, dealing with distributors in the United States and Middle East. From 2009 until his arrest, prosecutors said, he moved millions of dollars in Apple products and claimed a seven-figure annual income. He dodged Washington state sales taxes by buying iPhones in Portland and shipping them to the Middle East. Rezakhani was already under investigation by January 2014, when a Homeland Security agent watching his parents’ home in the Seattle suburbs saw FedEx pick up a shipment bound for Singapore. At the same time, Rezakhani was opening large lines of credit. He provided false tax returns and bank statements to obtain the loans, and owed $2.8 million on one when the FBI interrupted his operation. Rezakhani provided Foundation Bank with a purported agreement with Apple authorizing his company to resell its products. The fake document helped him secure a $4 million loan, according to prosecutors. In March 2015, Rezakhani moved into a $26,265-a-month penthouse. Rezakhani’s theft from Foundation Bank helped force the bank’s sale in 2016 and caused many people to lose their jobs, government lawyers said. Twice Rezakhani claimed shipments of iPhones had been stolen in transit. Investigators said they were attempts to defraud FedEx and UPS. Rezakhani told FedEx investigators that a shipment of 1,280 phones had been replaced with kitchen tiles. Several of the cartons were found packed with anti-Apple leaflets naming Foxconn, a Chinese electronics manufacturer notable for its poor treatment of workers. Surveillance video showed Rezakhani buying the tiles days before he bought the missing phones. He made similar claims in July 2015, asserting that a $5.6 million shipment had been replaced with stone blocks. Rezakhani bought the blocks at a building supply store days before sending the shipment. In October, investigators raided Rezakhani’s penthouse apartment and his parents’ home. They seized financial documents and electronics, as well as $114,000 in cash. Rezakhani was arrested in December. He ultimately pleaded guilty to mail fraud, bank fraud and filing a false tax return. Doing so, he admitted faking the shipping losses, lying to obtain the $4 million Foundation Bank loan and hiding income from the IRS. Rezakhani has agreed to pay back taxes and to repay Foundation Bank $3.1 million. He also agreed to pay $349,000 to Apple and two other companies he swindled. That restitution comes on top of $3.3 million that he has agreed to forfeit to the government. Levi Pulkkinen is a SeattlePI.com writer.

There are more than 85 different choices for local file systems (at least that was the case last time I counted), including HFS(P), APFS, FAT32, NTFS, EXT4, XFS, and Btrfs to name just a few, all covering various kinds of hardware and providing a variety of features. You can find many informative articles explaining the differences in performance and limitations of local file systems, so I want to focus here on shared file systems — a whole different beast. Let’s start with a short trip into the past, to help us figure out why there are so many file systems to choose from in the first place. Know the Past to Understand the Present – and to Be Prepared for the Future Not that long ago, really, we were grateful for the ability to share data amongst computers at all, utilizing protocols such as Network File System (NFS) for the *nix world, the Common Internet File System (CIFS, aka Server Message Block or SMB) for Windows machines, followed by the Apple Filing Protocol (AFP, aka AppleShare) for Apple computers. Network speeds were an earth-shattering 10 Mbit then, and with a lot of money, or a little luck, you might even have had an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) based network, providing a mind-blowing speed of 155 Mbit. Performance has multiplied dramatically since then, with 40 Gbit basically being the standard today, and 100 Gbit right on the horizon — and that’s just for the Ethernet protocol. The development was similar with Fibre Channel (FC). A then-phenomenal throughput of 1 Gbit in 1997 has jumped to 128 Gbit some 20 years later, at least with adequate switches available today from vendors such as Brocade. In addition to these, the two most popular topologies for shared file systems, there are of course InfiniBand (IB) and Serial Attached SCSI (SAS), more commonly used for server-to-server or RAID-system-to-JBOD expansion, etc. The Big Shift Demands on network performance and speed skyrocketed when the movie industry started the digital revolution and created more and more computer-generated (CG) imagery. From 3D CG to VFX to color correction, every step in the production and post-production process of moving pictures was suddenly generating numerous digital media files. Instead of countless video tapes piling up in the archives of post-production facilities, unstructured (or “unfiled”) media files flooded the IT servers, creating data chaos and leaving IT personnel to invest a lot of manual effort in detangling the mess. In the early 2000s, the hype about HD 1920×1080 (and later UHD 3840×2160) formats cranked up the demands even further, as file sizes suddenly were multiplied by four, forcing IT networks to keep up with the increased workload. (What a shame that it took more than 20 years for the official introduction of HD formats — if, in the early 90s, anyone had listened to the Digital HDTV Grand Alliance, who won an Emmy Award in 1997, we would have enjoyed HDTV a lot earlier.) With this unstoppable evolution, clustered (or shared) file systems arose. However, the first attempts to attach storage to the network (network-attached storage or NAS) turned out be a huge bottleneck in regards to performance. However, direct-attached storage (DAS) wasn’t that practical either, as data had to be duplicated and transferred to be available on other machines. Instead, storage area networks (SANs) were employed, connecting attached devices with Fibre Channel. Without touching the ongoing controversy whether Fibre Channel or Ethernet is the better choice, and while acknowledging that the payload of Ethernet packages and Fibre Channel frames are almost identical, the basic concept of a SAN-based file system has one clear upside: splitting the metadata from the user data, and therefore allowing access of the user data straight from the storage at high speed rather than going through one single server. The metadata itself still travels through Ethernet and TCP/IP, maybe due to the fact that the Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) is running over a practically lossless transport and retransmissions of frames is simply not built in. Before the introduction of 16 Gbit FC, there was no forward error correction (FEC), and corrupted frames would simply be discarded or, even worse, could create unpleasant I/O timeouts of 30-60 seconds. FC has some general advantages over Ethernet in terms of speed, reliability and its dedicated network, isolated from the general network traffic. At the same time, the latter creates the one major downside of FC though, as maintaining a dedicated network is more costly. Also, FC is more expensive when it comes to initial investment. Yet, FC has become the de facto standard for storage connections. Because FC is based on SCSI, ESCON and HIPPI (who remembers that?), it was only logical to eventually build a file system that was pretty close to the storage’s own transport protocol. Early adopters of FC-based technologies developed the first clustered file systems, starting in the mid 90’s. One of the first was Mountain Gate with the very first shared file system, Centra Vision File System (CVFS). Mountain Gate got acquired by ADIC in 1999, and the technology eventually became Quantum’s StorNext File System (SNFS). In the late 90’s, IBM’s Spectrum Scale, commonly known as General Parallel File System (GPFS), started as MultiMedia File System, and SGI joined the game with their Clustered Extents File System (CXFS), also known as InfiniteStorage Shared File system. In 2003, an open-source file system called Lustre was born, and the latest player in the field came from the Chinese Academy of Science in 2006, with a project named Blue Whale Clustered File System (BWFS), aka HyperFS, completing the group of five file systems that support FC as basis protocol. So What Is the Best FC-based File System? As usual, there’s no straight answer to this question. It depends on your particular situation. When selecting a FC-based file system, you may want to take several parameters into account, ranging from client support to usability (or rather ease of use). You need to consider how many and which particular clients will need high throughput, like 4K raw footage (~1300 MB/sec) via fibre channel. While all five shared FC-based file systems can deliver very high performance pushing data through the wire, not all of them have the ability to natively support all three major worlds of OS X, Linux and Windows. All those platforms are supported by BWFS, CXFS and SNFS, but bear in mind GPFS has no OS X support and Lustre is merely for UNIX/Linux environments. The basic file-system design is important. With a rather simple and straightforward structure, BWFS, CXFS and SNFS are lean and comparably easy when it comes to the setup. In a minimal setup, you can start with a single metadata server/controller (MDS/MDC) and a single configuration file for the shared volume, and only need to define one LUN as metadata LUN and another LUN for data. The MDS/MDC is in charge of maintaining the inodes or B-trees where directories and files reside and which attributes they carry. Lustre FS and GPFS take a different and somewhat more complex approach by managing everything through a database that resides on the disks itself, or through several configuration files. As the learning curve for configuring both Lustre and GPFS is quite steep — there is a good reason why the user manual for GPFS is about 700 pages long — I would recommend getting at least basic training, which will be extremely helpful. Without a good deal of knowledge of file systems in general and how to configure Lustre FS and GPFS in particular, you might end up spending a lot of time learning by doing. Plus, even if you have configured the volume, there are plenty of options to turn knobs, flip switches and optimize it for your individual needs. Unfortunately, there is no golden setting for an optimal file system for all workflows alike, just averages and best practices for the FS block sizes, stripe sizes, buffers and so on. Setting up the perfect file system for your specific workflow will require a lot of testing and tweaking, including starting from scratch to find the best performance for your particular needs. On the other hand, the perhaps-overwhelming complexity has its advantages. Depending on your workflow, Lustre FS and GPFS can be configured over WAN systems with multiple metadata and quorum servers. This option provides a much higher resistance to failure and therefore a higher uptime. For example, you could share a single namespace across two locations. If the main link between both sites goes dark, the site that has the most quorum servers (at least +1, as quorum nodes should have an odd number) can continue to write content while the other site has only read access. Once the WAN link becomes active again, the data will be redistributed automatically without any manual intervention. Also, most changes can be done on the fly without bringing the FS down, while the other FC-based file systems have to be stopped and started to re-read the configuration. So while the initial setup and configuration process might be a little more complicated compared to the other three FC-based file systems, there are upsides. Plus, don’t worry. Many websites will assist you in getting a file system up and running. The Easy Way vs. Doing It Right Except for GPFS and Lustre FS, most of the modern file systems come with a convenient GUI that guides a new user through the setup. Wizards make it easy to create your first clustered file system, preventing you from falling into the common pitfalls. However, if you haven’t studied all the manuals from A to Z and are not sure how all the gears work together, you will have a working file system in the end — but not one that’s optimized. If you really want to get the most and best performance out of your (rather expensive) distributed file system, I encourage you to dig much deeper into the matter than just clinging to the GUI. Remember the ancient saying “Real men don’t click,” and consider using the command-line interface instead. Doing it from scratch will cost more time, yes, but you will learn more and better understand how your file system works, and what options you have for adjusting and optimizing it for your particular workflow. File Systems in the Post-Production and Broadcast Arena After spending most of my time in the M&E vertical, I learned that, aside from performance, support for the three major operating systems (OS) is very important. Evidently, this crosses Lustre and GPFS as file systems suitable for M&E pretty quickly off the list, as neither provides native support for OS X. Unlike Lustre, GPFS at least supports Windows clients; however, the installation of a Windows client in GPFS is everything but simple. Plus, it requires the advanced Windows version (at least for official support). While the GPFS driver is kernel-based, the CygWin environment (a Linux-like environment for Windows) has to be installed before the client can mount the GPFS volume. It feels rather clunky, considering that the driver for Windows has been around for about 15 years. As Windows clients are available from most of them, SNFS and BWFS provide a pretty smooth installer that is easy to configure and mounts your volumes at the end of the installation. Some improvement would be nice for CXFS and, of course, GPFS. On the OS X site, XSAN is implemented natively since OS X Lion (10.7). While the configuration doesn’t really change between versions, Apple keeps moving the configuration files around for some reason. The only thing you have to do is to add the IP for the MDS and configure the config.plist — once you find it. Search for help on the Internet, where some pages can guide you through the process. BWFS installs the same easy way as SNFS on an OS X and is a similarly lightweight configuration where you only have to touch a few files. A bit more knowledge is required when it comes to the CXFS configuration, as it’s all about fencing of WWPNs. For all clustered FS vendors, *nix installations are very smooth and straightforward. Though they are really wordy, the manuals are on average 1.5 pages long, and guide you easily and quickly through the installation procedures. In no time, the FS client has been configured and can see the shared volume. Bottom Line There really is neither a “bad” file system, nor the ne plus ultra that’s perfect for everyone. Hence, I won’t recommend any particular shared file system. I’ve learned over the last 15+ years in the field that there are three major parameters that determine which file system fits best for a company: the specific workflow requirements, the expectation regarding features and performance, and, last but not least, the available budget. But to give you at least a little support in your decision-making, I recommend you assess and evaluate your specific needs from every angle. For instance, if your shared media is mainly unstructured data and you’re looking for fast access and high performance, look thoroughly at the applications and client OS that need access. If you are in the field of high-performance computing or VFX, for example, and the clients in your network are without exception *nix based, you can choose pretty much every option available today, including GPFS and Lustre FS. If your network consists of heterogeneous clients, running all three major OS, rather check out the file systems that will support all of them — or you may end up maintaining two or more file systems, and that would really defeat the purpose. Either way, if you are new to the whole SAN experience, ask around, get training, or hire a professional to assist you. But please do your homework, as I’ve seen very questionable setups — even, unfortunately, from professional vendors. Keep in mind that a wizard-based setup will guide you but can’t make the necessary decisions for the best performance. And make sure you get it right the first time, because once the file system is in use, there is no chance to start over without investing a lot of time (and suffering a lot of pain).

Twitter Facebook Cisco expands wireless reach with access points, management software Cisco targets SMB arena with new Aironet APs, Mobility Express software. Michael Cooney (Network World) 30 March, 2017 02:00 - - - - print email Comments Perhaps nowhere is the challenge of keeping up with the onslaught of wireless devices greater than in the small-to-midsized companies with little or no IT expertise to handle it. That’s the target for Cisco’s latest line of 802.11ac Wave 2-based wireless products which include scalable Aironet wireless access points and a new version of Cisco’s Mobility Express software to manage the whole environment. +More on Network World: When the Internet Engineering Task Force meets this week in Chicago it will have a new chair – Cisco Fellow Alissa Cooper + The need for faster, more easily managed wireless networks is obvious: Cisco said in its in Cisco’s 11th annual Visual Networking Index last year that traffic from wireless and mobile devices will account for two-thirds of total IP traffic by 2020. By 2020, wired devices will account for 34% of IP traffic, while Wi-Fi and mobile devices will account for 66% of IP traffic. In 2015, wired devices accounted for most IP traffic at 52%. Cisco says that by 2020 there will be 26.3 billion networked devices averaging a speed of 24Mbps. Not only will there be more devices, but mobile business applications in the workplace, generating more traffic. An updated version of Mobility Express in fact may be the key to the current announcement as it includes support for the “fast lane” technology Cisco and Apple have been developing since the companies announced a technology development partnership in 2015. In this case, Cisco said that customers can pick the Apple iOS apps they want to receive prioritized network bandwidth, which is especially important for apps that use real-time services such as video and voice. +More on Network World: Cisco Talos warns of Apple iOS and MacOS X.509 certificate flaw+ In addition, Mobility Express basically includes all the embedded intelligence needed to run and manage SMB wireless environments, Cisco said. The package now supports up to 100 access points – the previous version was limited to 25 --and can be configured in less than10 minutes, Cisco says. Mobility Express supports the 802.11ac Wave 2 standards and other features previously available only in high performance, standalone WLAN Controllers. A small and midsize enterprise will now be able to offer the same high-speed, feature-laden network that larger organizations use, according to Bill Rubino, Cisco Enterprise Mobility Solutions marketing manager.   In addition, the new version Mobility Express: Runs WLAN controller function on an access point supporting up to 2,000 clients. Offers Plug-and-Play for zero touch deployment. Lets customers understand exactly what is running on their network. Supports and manages guests via Wi-Fi Onboarding with Presence Analytics. With this application customers can see and analyze network guest activity. On the hardware side, Cisco is offering up Aironet 1815 Series Access Point family for indoor networking; the Aironet 1540 Access Point for outdoor; and a new WLAN controller, the Cisco 3504. Cisco The Aironet 1815 802.11ac Wave 2-based devices come in four configurations, the 1815i is the overall ideal solution for any small-to-midsized business; 1815t is targeted for teleworks and micro-branch deployments; The 1815w is targeted at hospitality, residential halls or other multi-dwelling units and the 1815m has more transmit power for budget-conscious organizations that need a wide coverage zone. The 1815 family fills out Cisco’s Aironet portfolio as it offers the 2800 and 3800 for larger enterprise wireless deployments. For wireless outdoor networks, a market growing 15% to 20% quarter over quarter, Cisco says, the company rolled out the Aironet 1540 Access Point he 1540 AP supports the 802.11ac Wave 2 standard and comes equipped with Cisco enterprise features. The 1540s can transmit data up to twice as fast as Cisco’s previous outdoor access point and can perform double duty as virtual WLAN controllers, the company says. “Customers can run wireless networks without buying separate controller and it includes the enterprise-class Cisco RF management capabilities—like security scanning, interference avoidance and application visibility,” Rubino said. Cisco At the top end of this announcement is the Cisco 3504 WLAN Access Controller. The access point scales to 150 access points and supports 3,000 clients. It too supports Apple fast lane technology, BYOD services, Trustsec and Open DNS features for managing larger wireless environments. The wireless update will bolster the company’s wireless stance versus HPE Aruba, Ruckus (now with Brocade); Extreme, Aerohive, Juniper and others. All products are available in April apart from the 3504 which is available in the June timeframe. Pricing for the 3504 has not been set. Pricing for the other devices goes like this: Aironet 1540 Outdoor AP: $995; Aironet 1815 Indoor Series AP: 1815i (Infrastructure) AP: $495; 1815t (teleworker) AP: $595; 1815w (wallplate) AP: $495; 1815m (higher coverage) AP: $595. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

The sleek, black handset appears to show the sensor positioned on the back, just below the Apple logo and about the third of the way down the phone. If the report is true, then the new setup could be part of Apple’s plan to add facial recognition technology to the device. Scroll down for video  The sleek, black handset appears to show the sensor positioned on the back, just below the Apple logo and about the third of the way down the phone. If the report is true, then the new setup could be part of Apple’s plan to add facial recognition technology to the device IPHONE 8 TOUCH ID  The latest leak reveals Apple's plans to put the Touch ID on the back of the iPhone 8.  The sleek, black handset appears to show the sensor positioned on the back, just below the Apple logo and about the third of the way down the phone. If the report is true, then the new setup could be part of Apple’s plan to add facial recognition technology to the device.  It is now believed that Apple will be going with a type of metal material for the back, as ‘the glass back prototypes were too prone to shattering when dropped’. The new image were obtained by iDropNews ‘from a source with intimate knowledge of Apple’s manufacturing facility’. The anonymous source from Foxconn noted that other leaks floating around the web do look similar to the final product, but with a few exceptions. Many leakers have stated that the Touch ID sensor would make its way under the display to make room for the larger edge-to-edge screen. But Apple is following in line with its Android rivals and relocating it to the rear of the phone, 9to5Mac reported. And although you will have to pick up the phone to access it – the new setup is believed to accommodate the addition of facial recognition technology. Another rumor that has been debunked by the mysterious source is the ‘glass back’. It is believed that Apple will be going with a type of metal material for the back, as ‘the glass back prototypes were too prone to shattering when dropped’. Earlier this month it was revealed that users will be able to purchase the iPhone 8 in September, but an analyst note warned that Apple will not be able to meet the demand – leaving some users empty handed at launch.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Do you see a rocket ship in YOUR Facebook app?

Share this article Share 14 shares The majority of stock may not be available until later in the fourth quarter, according to the latest research from Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Thomas O'Malley, and Jerry Zhang.   'Suppliers generally had good things to say about the upcoming iPhone 8 launch (for our purposes iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and iPhone Pro) as new features drive a more complicated manufacturing process and higher ASPs,' the note says, according to MacRumours. Previous speculations listed the smartphone as the ‘iPhone 8’, but the latest report suggested it will be called ‘iPhone Edition’ (artist impression). The handset is also said to be announced in September, but the actual release will be much later than Apple's usual timeline 'We now believe that all three devices will feature wireless charging and will all be launched in the normal September timeframe, although the majority of iPhone Pro volumes may not be available until Q4.'  Previous speculations have listed the smartphone as the ‘iPhone 8’, but the latest report has suggested it will be called ‘iPhone Edition’.  The new rumor comes from Macotakara, a Japanese new site, which also revealed that Apple is testing a range of prototypes for its flagship device this year- suggesting the firm has yet to nail down a final design. Some of the models are without the Home button and there are others that have different chassis designs – some with glass, ceramic or aluminum, 9to5Mac reported. Apple is also said to be validating its tests and ‘needs more time to procure materials needed to make final design decisions’, which is why Macotakara speculated that the 'iPhone Edition' will be released later this year. ‘Multiple prototype models exist for this model and the development continues to be carried out in parallel with EVT,’ wrote Macotakara. Apple is also said to be validating its tests and ‘needs more time to procure materials needed to make final design decisions’, which is it is speculated that the 'iPhone Edition' (artist impression) will be released later this year. ‘The production level of development on various models are being done such as the models with IPS TFT, AMOLED, the model with or without home button, in addition to the models with a new glass, aluminum chassis, white ceramics etc.’ However, the report also noted that Apple has decided on a few features, which includes a 5-inch display, dual-cameras and wireless charging capabilities. Macotakara also said that the ‘iPhone Edition’ will be announced alongside with the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus in September, but the official release will occur much later than other Apple products. However, another report also noted that Apple has decided on a few features, which includes a 5-inch display, dual-cameras and wireless charging capabilities (artist impressions) Another news source across the Pacific shared other rumors about Apple’s upcoming flagship device – but in this report, the handset is called ‘iPhone 8’. Nikkei Asian Review explained that Apple will release three handsets this year and the 10th-anniversary will be the most expensive iPhone yet.  Two are set to have liquid crystal displays and the other will be designed with a 5.8-inch organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen. Earlier reports have suggested that the two other smartphones, known as the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will be designed with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays. The report also said that the ‘iPhone Edition’ (artist impressions) will be announced alongside with the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus in September, but the official release will occur much later than other Apple products ‘By adding more large-screen options to the lineup to meet grousing demand for BIG, Apple intends to raise the average iPhone price, which has already gone up by about 10% in the past three years to nearly $700,’ Nikkei reported. Previous rumors have already identified an increase in price. Earlier this month it was revealed by Fast Company that the so-called iPhone 8 will costs more than $1,000 (£800) – making it the most expensive handset the firm has ever produced. IPHONE 8 RUMORS   Several rumors have been circulating about the iPhone 8, and suggest the next device may have:  - Dual-lens 3D camera - Augmented reality to generate real-time views of surroundings  - Curved glass casing - Plastic OLED screen - Wireless charging - A folding element  - New 5 inch (12.7 centimeter) and 5.8 inch (14.7 centimeter) model, which will have a wraparound OLED screen  - 5.8 inch will be designed with the Touch ID finger print sensor 'under the glass and in the active display area' - A new 'pure white' model - Aluminum back will be replaced with two reinforced glass panes and a metal frame in the middle  - Facial recognition However, it is said that users will receive more cutting-edge technology and a sleeker design – a handset that is sure to impress. Nikkei also speculated a later release day - the source sites October for when the device will officially launch. However, this report noted that it is because the iPhone is not going into mass production until September. The delay is being blamed on Apple’s custom fingerprint sensor that is set to replace the TouchID – the firm is building its own system and needs more time for manufacturing, reported DigitTimes. Other leakers have also speculated a later release day - the source sites October for when the device will officially launch. However, it noted that it is because the iPhone (artist impression) is not going into mass production until September It is believed that Apple passed over both the Synaptic’s Natural ID touch fingerprint sensor and Qualcomm’s Sense ID for the iPhone - and is designing its own.  ‘Apple's in-house developed fingerprint ID solution will be fabricated at TSMC's 12-inch line using 65nm process technology, sources told DigitTimes. The sources also said this move will push production for the OLED iPhone back until September, which means the handset will not go on sale until October. However, it may be worth the wait, as this technology will allow for a bezel-less design because the component will be a ‘built-in’ sensor integrated into the display, reports 9to5Mac.  LARGER BATTERY  Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities has revealed that Apple plans to put a larger battery in the 4.7-inch iPhone 8.  Kuo explained that it will be designed with a 2,700 mAh battery - putting its battery capacity on par with the iPhone 7 Plus.  Another feature rumored to appear in Apple's next iPhone is a larger 'L' shaped battery (middle', which would put battery capacity on par with the iPhone 7 Plus Will use a 'substrate-like PCB mainboard', which will allow the firm to implement an OLED display in the flagship handset.  The new components are believed to be much more expensive in anything used in an iPhone before, which could increase manufacturing costs by 80 percent.  However, it was revealed last week that iOS users should expect to pay a hefty price tag for their next iPhone. It is speculated that this component will use biometric technologies, instead of the traditional capacitive sensors found in Touch ID. And these rumors stated that the technology will be positioned in the ‘function area’ region of the display. Although the delay could be a disappointment, Apple is one to stick close to a timeline when it comes to launching its devices, which is usually in September. And the last time the firm released a handset in October was the iPhone 4s.   Read more: Apple redesigns fingerprint ID solution for OLED iPhone, say sources ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿iPhone Edition¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ | Rumor | Mac ...

It’s surprising, given that iOS represents one of the most important features of the iPhone and a reason why many people would not leave Apple’s platform for any competing mobile operating system. A new report out of Israel brings says that Siri will get a massive upgrade in iOS 11, revealing some of the new purported features of Apple’s smarter virtual assistant. Don't Miss: NASA just captured a photo of Jupiter that you won’t believe is real According to The Verifier, Siri will gain more powers on all of Apple’s devices, including iPhone, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. The most important features, if the report is accurate, seem to be Siri integration in iMessage and iCloud. Siri in iMessage would probably work very similarly to what Google’s Assistant inside Google Allo. The assistant would be ready to offer context-based suggestions, like where to go to dinner and how to get there. Apple already has a patent detailing such a feature. The iCloud integration would allow Siri to identify the user’s various devices that might be associated with an Apple ID, and offer actions and responses across operating systems, including Mac and iPhone. Siri would reportedly learn more details about the user’s habits, and offer different actions based on the context, not just in iMessage, the report indicates. The report says Siri will be comparable to Bixby when it comes to feature, which is Samsung’s recently introduced voice-based assistant. Bixby, however, is yet to prove itself as it’ll only launch in limited form with the Galaxy S8. Considering that everyone is beefing up their virtual assistants, it’s likely Apple will upgrade Siri in iOS 11, even though there’s no way of verifying The Verifier’s interesting claims at this point.

Contrary to a previous report saying that the Cupertino giant’s smartphones have become faster mainly because the update is freeing up more space, the engineer is crediting the evident change on software performance to the tweaks made to the animations.  On Tuesday, Apple engineer Renaud Lienhart — who is directly involved in the development of the iOS operating system — took to Twitter to explain why users are seeing a positive change on the performance of their iPhones since installing the iOS 10.3 update. According to Lienhart the reason why devices feel “snappier” with iOS 10.3 is because of the tweaks they have made to the animations. He also admitted that animations have been shortened for the better.  The Verge points out that though the animations for launching and exiting apps as well as switching between apps do not have significant differences from the ones in iOS 10.2.1, the operating system does feel more responsive with the overall daily tasks on the iPhons 6s Plus. Other iPhone generations and variants are expected to also have the same tweaks, so they are presumed to be more responsive than before as well.  Aside from the tweaked animations, iOS 10.3’s new modern file system is also contributing to the overall faster performance of the operating system. The APFS is reportedly designed to be low latency, and this should enhance the read and write speeds on the iPhone and the iPad. Not only does the APFS boost storage, it also lays the foundation for when Apple fully switches to supporting only 64-bit apps on iOS, a move that is expected to happen with the upcoming iOS 11, as noted by The Verge in a separate report.  On Monday, Apple rolled out iOS 10.3 to the public, keeping its promise of introducing a new Apple File System, Siri improvements as well as the Find My AirPods feature to the public. For users who have yet to update their devices, they are advised to create a backup prior to downloading iOS 10.3.  iPhoneMore An Apple engineer has explained why iOS 10.3 feels “snappier.” Photo: Reuters/Phil Noble Related Articles Apple Stock Jump To Record High After Analyst Predicts $200 iOS 11 Rumors: Siri To Get A Boost in Artificial Intelligence, Will Come With Contextual Learning iOS 10.3 Release: New Features, Updates To Apps Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next This is not a drill: Nintendo Switch and NES Classic will be in stock today at Best Buy BGR News Go get these crazy MacBook deals while you can BGR News We're sorry this is all we were able to find about this topic.

March 30th 2017 16 hours ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ The Apple's iPhone 4s (left) and Samsung's Galaxy S3 (right). Picture: AFP/Jung Yeon-je Jennifer Dudley-Nicholson in New YorkNews Corp Australia Network SAMSUNG’S flagship smartphones launch in just 29 days, giving investors less than a month to decide whether to opt for Apple, go for the Galaxy, or try something else entirely. To make the decision easier, we’ve pitted the top two smartphones from both market leaders against one another: Samsung Galaxy S8+ versus Apple iPhone 7 Plus. While their names are just one number apart, each has its own strengths and weaknesses, and your decision may depend on whether you prefer bigger screens or more cameras. REVIEW: Samsung Galaxy S8 & S8+ NEW PHONES: Samsung’s resurrection Samsung Galaxy S8: Longer Screen, New AI Assistant2:53 The S8 is Samsung?s flagship Galaxy phone evolved. WSJ Personal Tech columnist Geoffrey A. Fowler takes a first look at its nearly all-encompassing screen, its new assistant Bixby, and its dock that lets the phone double as desktop computer. Photo: Emily Prapuolenis March 30th 2017 16 hours ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ SCREEN Apple’s biggest phone features a 5.5-inch LED backlit touchscreen that qualifies as a Retina Display. That’s because its resolution, at 401 pixels per inch, means you can’t pick out the individual dots even under close inspection with the naked eye. However, Samsung wins this category as its S8+ not only packs a larger screen into similarly sized body, at 6.2 inches, but delivers a resolution of 529 pixels per inch. Its display is also certified as a Mobile HDR Premium screen, meaning it’s ready to display the wider colour range offered by new video formats. Winner: Samsung The Galaxy S8 features a larger display than its predecessor, the Galaxy S7, and sports a voice assistant intended to rival Siri and Google Assistant. Picture: AP Photo/Mary AltafferSource:AP CAMERA The biggest change to Apple’s top iPhone was its photographic redesign. The iPhone 7 Plus added two 12-megapixel cameras — one wide-angle and one telephoto — delivering a 2x optical zoom. Samsung refreshed the front camera on its latest phone, adding an extra three megapixels and autofocus, as well as a new Anti-Blur feature to its rear 12-megapixel camera. On paper, it seems like Apple wins this round, though we have yet to test the new Samsung camera. Winner: Likely Apple Apple's iPhone 7 Plus features a camera with two lenses and water resistance for the first time, though it omits a headphone jack. Picture: SuppliedSource:Supplied ASSISTANT Samsung’s smart voice assistant, Bixby, makes its debut inside the S8+ and it comes with big promises. The company says it will offer more commands, and command combinations, in Bixby-supported apps, will be aware of what you’re doing in an app, will let you combine touch and voice controls, and ask you more questions rather than give up on requests. However, Bixby is still an untested proposition. Apple’s Siri has been around since late 2011 and has become more useful over time. You can ask it to find nearby Japanese restaurants, open apps, or place video calls. It’s not infallible but it’s certainly useful. Winner: Apple Apple’s Siri has been around since late 2011 and has become more useful over time. Picture: SuppliedSource:istock CONNECTIVITY Apple’s big iPhone supports the latest wi-fi standards, Bluetooth 4.2 for use with its bonkers wireless earbuds, and an NFC connection exclusively for Apple Pay. However, the newest iPhones don’t have a headphone jack any more, and the new Samsung phones kept theirs for good reason. Even if they had given up the industry standard connection, the S8+ would win the connectivity stakes. It supports download speeds up to one gigabit per second (LTE Category 16), Bluetooth 5.0, NFC, and features a USB-C port. Winner: Samsung A more efficient processor means faster downloads, longer battery life, and less wasted energy. #UnboxYourPhone. https://t.co/pHVmdc8ZNj pic.twitter.com/oDVCK387so— Samsung Mobile (@SamsungMobile) March 29, 2017 ACCESSORIES Samsung’s new Galaxy S8+ accessories are both advanced and innovative. The DeX dock plugs into a monitor, keyboard and mouse so this phone can be used to power an Android-based desktop computer experience. The new Gear 360 camera looks even more promising, and can connect to the phone to live-stream 360-degree video to Facebook or YouTube. There’ll also be a new Gear VR headset with a controller for this phone. Apple is not short of accessories, however. From gimbals and connected baby monitors, to macro camera lenses and robotic balls, the biggest iPhone has a lot of bases covered. Winner: Tie The Samsung DeX dock plugs into a monitor, keyboard and mouse. Picture: AP Photo/Mary AltafferSource:AP STORAGE Can you guess how much you’ll want to store on your phone now, or do you want to adapt later? Neither Apple’s nor Samsung’s top models scrimps on storage. Samsung’s Galaxy S8+ comes with 64GB as standard, and will support memory cards adding 256GB more. Apple’s built-in flash storage might be faster to use, though you have to decide upfront whether you’ll need just 32GB, or as much as 256GB. Winner: Tie The Apple iPhone 7 Plus, right, doesn’t scrimp on storage. Picture: AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato, FileSource:AP PRICE Annoyingly, it’s hard to directly compare prices for these two phones. Both sit comfortably at the high end of smartphone pricing, with a starting price of $1269 for Apple, and $1349 for Samsung. But that doesn’t tell the whole story. The cheapest iPhone 7 Plus only gives you 32GB storage, while the Samsung Galaxy S8+ comes with 64GB and room to expand. If you were to buy a 64GB MicroSD card for $30 from Officeworks, you could get a top model Samsung with 128GB storage for $40 less than its Apple equivalent. Winner: Samsung by the cost of a DVD People test out the new Samsung Galaxy S8 at its launch in New York. Picture: SuppliedSource:Supplied OVERALL With three out of possible eight wins, Samsung appears to claim technological victory, however it’s an indisputably close race and as little as six months until the next iPhones arrive and the battle begins afresh.

You read that right: Until Wednesday, the tech titan hadn’t optimized its marquee calendar application to run on Apple’s tablets. The app provides users with a view of the calendars that they have and that are shared with them through Google’s service. In addition, they get a handful of features Apple’s native calendar app doesn’t have, like the ability to more easily find time and space for a meeting with other people inside their organizations. Making iPad users wait for a native Calendar app is hardly a surprise coming from Google, considering that it’s the company behind Android, and frequently ships new features first to apps for devices running its mobile operating system. That’s not to say Google Calendar was completely unavailable for iPad users for the past several years. The iPhone app for Calendar could run on Apple’s tablets, but it wasn’t optimized for use on those devices. The move is a part of Google’s continuing push to make its G Suite productivity services useful to as broad a set of people as possible. Google is working aggressively to get customers to switch to its productivity suite from their current systems, which in many cases, revolve around Microsoft Office. Microsoft offers its own calendar app for the iPad in the form of Outlook for iOS, which has supported Apple's tablet since its launch in 2015. Google has more iOS-specific features planned, including a Today widget that will let users see their upcoming events in an iPad’s Notification Center, according to a blog post by Calendar product manager Sharon Stovezky. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

By Gregg Keizer Senior Reporter, Computerworld | Mar 29, 2017 12:50 PM PT Credit: CC0 Public Domain More like this Trump’s unsecure Android phone highlights common security dilemma Trump, tech executives may try to untangle relationship Report: Trump still uses his unsecured Android phone to tweet Video Mingis on Tech: Self-driving cars, wireless charging -- and Wi-Fi lightbulbs? President Donald Trump now uses an iPhone to broadcast his famous early-morning tweets, according to the White House. Trump's turn to the iPhone was contrary to a pledge he made more than a year ago, when he blasted Apple for refusing to help federal authorities crack the passcode on a device belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters. "@POTUS @realDonaldTrump has been using his new iPhone for the past couple of weeks here on Twitter," tweeted Dan Scavino Jr. today. Scavino is director of social media for the Trump administration, as well as a senior advisor to the president. @POTUS and @realDonaldTrump are the official U.S. President's and Trump's personal Twitter accounts, respectively. Although Trump used an iPhone to make both of his Wednesday morning tweets -- one that included yet another rant against the New York Times -- an Android smartphone was used as recently as Saturday on the @realDonaldTrump account, hinting that he's not tied to a single device. Computerworld used Tweetbot, a third-party Twitter app for iOS and macOS, to view the sending device; Tweetbot displayed "via Twitter for iPhone" on the two @realDonaldTrump tweets of today. Trump's use of an iPhone was a switch from his stance a year ago, when on the campaign trail he urged supporters to boycott Apple. "Apple ought to give the security for that phone, okay? What I think you ought to do is boycott Apple until such a time as they give that security number. How do you like that? I just thought of it. Boycott Apple," Trump told supporters at a February 2016 rally in South Carolina. Trump was referring to the Cupertino, Calif. company's refusal to assist the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in cracking a password-protected iPhone that had been owned by San Bernardino gunman Syed Rizwan Farook. The same day he called for a boycott, Trump acknowledged that he used both an iPhone and a Samsung smartphone. "If Apple doesn't give info to authorities on the terrorists I'll only be using Samsung until they give info," Trump pledged on Twitter. Although Trump blasted his tweets from an Android device, as well as from Twitter's web interface, he did not stop using an iPhone. Tweets from @realDonaldTrump on April 2, for example, were made from an Apple-branded phone. Apple never acceded to the DOJ's demands. Instead, the agency contracted with an unknown firm, which in turn was able to hack the iPhone's passcode and access the data on the device.

Shares We heard earlier today that a newly filed patent points towards Apple employing a new ultrasonic fingerprint scanner embedded in future iPhone displays. But could the Cupertino company be planning something a little less groundbreaking for the iPhone 8 and beyond? That's what's being posed by iDropNews. It's claiming that Apple will instead be pushing the Touch ID scanner to the rear of the handset in order to save bezel space, as is seen in Android handsets like the LG G5. In addition, the source (said to be a Foxconn assembly line insider) is claiming that the expected iPhone 8 will be named the "iPhone Edition", and that it will feature a vertical dual-camera system – all pictured in the site's render above. Believe it...or not It's worth taking the iDropNews rumors with a pinch of salt – we've yet to see its predictions and reports bear accurate fruit, while some of its suggestions for the next iPhone merely repeat things we've heard earlier from other trusted sources. That said, at least in the case of the rear fingerprint scanner, it's hardly an outlandish claim. There's precedent for rear-mounted finger scanners, however divisive they prove to be, and it'd be easier to implement then an all-new embedded display technology. But it's not exactly Apple's style to allow PR buzz to build around exciting new potential technologies without at least bursting the bubble first. It'd be a big comedown from a flashy embedded scanner to a rear one, especially when there's a weight of evidence pointing to Apple actively developing the tech. Treat this one with some caution for the time being, then. iPhone of the future could have an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner Topics iPhone Related news Beam: 5 reasons why you should care about Microsoft’s competitor to Twitch It’s official: Windows 10 Creators Update will be out on April 11 Best iPad games: the top free and paid-for titles around Best free iPad games 2017 See more Mobile phones news Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

Shares The Samsung Galaxy S8 is now official and this is sure to be one of the best phones on the market in 2017, but how does it compare to Apple's latest handset? There's tough competition out there right now for your next phone and the Galaxy S8 is designed to directly rival the iPhone 7. That begs the question, which is better? We won't know for certain until we fully review the new phone from Samsung, but here’s how it stacks up to Apple’s flagship based on our first impressions. Design The Samsung Galaxy S8 has a glass back and a metal frame, with the glass on both sides gently curving, to give it a symmetrical look and making it comfortable to hold in the hand. The iPhone 7 has a quite different but similarly premium design, with a metal unibody that’s slim and compact at 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm, while the Galaxy S8 is 148.9 x 68.1 x 8mm. That makes the iPhone 7 quite a bit smaller than the Galaxy S8, but it's still as easy to hold in the hand and use one-handed as the device from Apple. Still, the iPhone 7 is the more compact phone. It’s also one of the best-looking phones around – but the Galaxy S8 is also in that category. The S8 is also IP68 certified, making it slightly more water-resistant than the IP67 certified iPhone 7. Plus the Samsung Galaxy S8 comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack so you can use wired headsets with the phone. You won't get that with an iPhone 7. Screen The Samsung Galaxy S8 has a 5.8-inch screen, which is massive and means it dwarfs the 4.7-inch iPhone 7. Hold these phones together and you'll really notice how much smaller the iPhone is compared to this Android handset. It's not just the sizes that differ. The Samsung Galaxy S8 also uses Super AMOLED, where the iPhone 7’s screen is LCD – meaning Samsung’s phone offers more vivid, high-contrast colors. When holding these two screens together, you can really notice the difference on the Galaxy S8 compared to the slightly duller iPhone 7. The Galaxy S8 also has an incredibly sharp screen, with a resolution of 1440 x 2960, where the iPhone 7 is limited to 750 x 1334. The Samsung Galaxy S8 has the benefit of a curved screen at the edges too, while the iPhone 7’s is flat. The S8's look is a lot like the Galaxy S7 Edge, but that's no bad thing. The S8 also supports HDR content, which the iPhone 7 doesn’t. Samsung's flagship also has a different aspect ratio, at a very widescreen 18.5:9, with the iPhone 7 a more standard 16:9. In short then, the screen is one of the biggest differences between the two phones, and one where the Samsung Galaxy S8 has the much higher spec in nearly every department (apart from the more subjective display technology). But the iPhone 7 still has a high quality display, and not everyone is going to want a huge 5.8-inch option. OS and power The operating system is where the battle lines are drawn between these two phones, with the Samsung Galaxy S8 running Android Nougat and the iPhone 7 using iOS 10.2. Both phones are tremendously powerful though. We know for a fact that the iPhone 7 is the most grunt-worthy handset from Apple yet, with its Apple A10 Fusion chip and 2GB of RAM.  The Galaxy S8 is confirmed to ship with 4GB of RAM, while we don't know exactly what the processors are yet but it's rumored to be either a Snapdragon 835 chipset (in the US) or an Exynos 8895 one (in most other places). Those are both top-end chips, so we expect silky smooth performance in both and perhaps Samsung to at least match the iPhone in terms of screen response under the finger. Camera The Samsung Galaxy S8’s camera is much the same as the one the Samsung Galaxy S7 has. There's a 12MP sensor with f1.7 aperture. It's a good setup but might not hold up against the best in 2017. The iPhone 7’s camera is no slouch either. It’s a 12MP one too, and benefits from optical image stabilization, which the Samsung Galaxy S8 has as well. The Galaxy S8’s front-facing camera is also slightly more capable, with an 8MP sensor, where the iPhone 7’s is 7MP. Battery The Samsung Galaxy S8 has a 3,000mAh battery. That would make it a lot bigger than the iPhone 7’s 1,960mAh battery, but then the S8 is a much bigger phone with a high resolution screen, so it needs more juice. We can’t predict exactly how long-lasting it will be, but the iPhone 7 requires a daily charge, and sometimes doesn’t even make it through until bedtime, so the Samsung Galaxy S8 has a good chance of going further daily. The S8 is also supports fast charging. The iPhone 7 can also charge quickly, but only if you plug it in to a 2.1A iPad charger, rather than the plug that comes with the phone. Price We don’t yet know what the Samsung Galaxy S8 will cost, but rumors put it at around $845/£695/AU$1,115. The iPhone 7 meanwhile starts at $649/£599/AU$1,079. That would make the Samsung Galaxy S8 significantly more expensive than Apple’s flagship but then again there's only a 64GB version of the phone, while the iPhone 7 starts with 32GB of storage. There is no 64GB iPhone 7 model, but even the 128GB one comes in at $749/£699/AU$1,229, which is comparable in the UK and still cheaper than the rumored S8 price in the US. Takeaway The iPhone 7 is one of the best phones on the planet, and we have little doubt that the Samsung Galaxy S8 will be too, but they’re very different propositions. Beyond the obvious operating system differences, the Galaxy S8 has a larger, sharper and better screen, a very different – but similarly premium – design, and a probably higher price tag. Differences in the camera and performance may be harder to spot, and battery life remains something of an unknown until we run it through our full... ahem... battery of tests. Going purely by specs the Samsung Galaxy S8 looks to be the slightly more powerful phone – but the spec list isn't everything, and you may have to pay an eye-watering price to get it. The Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus is coming too.

When glamorous Emily French (Kim Cattrall) is brutally murdered in her home, all the evidence points to French’s young lover, Leonard Vole (Billy Howle), to whom the heiress left her fortune. Ms. French’s devoted housekeeper (Monica Dolan) proclaims Leonard’s guilt, but Leonard insists that his wife, enigmatic chorus girl Romaine (Andrea Riseborough, Bloodline, Birdman), can prove his innocence. As the scandalous crime goes to trial, solicitor John Mayhew (Toby Jones) finds that the case may be his undoing.

Both phones are powered by Android 7.0, have an octa-core processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of memory. They also feature a Super AMOLED Quad HD+ screen with what Samsung calls an “Infinity Display” which wraps around the whole of the front of the phone.

The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus are available to preorder from tomorrow (March 30) in Midnight Black, Orchid Gray, Arctic Silver, Coral Blue, and Maple Gold. Shipping in the U.S. will commence on April 21. Prices will vary from carrier to carrier, but are expected to start at $720. Do you own a Samsung handset?

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Hayley Tsukayama By Hayley Tsukayama March 29 at 4:54 PM Follow @htsuka (Hayley Tsukayama/The Washington Post) NEW YORK — Samsung on Wednesday unveiled its latest premium smartphones, the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus, which the company hopes will restore its reputation as one of the world’s best smartphone makers. To do that, of course, Samsung must recover from the disastrous recall of its last premium phone, the Galaxy Note 7. Samsung was forced to discontinue that product after a rash of battery fires, and also chose to delay the launch of these new phones in the wake of the controversy. DJ Koh, the head of Samsung’s mobile division, opened the presentation by acknowledging that 2016 had been a difficult year for the company. But he also added that this launch marks the start of “important new beginnings.” [Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus: As first impressions go, this is a doozy] Samsung was clearly eager to move on and reclaim its reputation as an innovator. Before the Note 7, Samsung had shaken off its old image of being a copycat and had ushered in the era of larger-screened phones — a move that arguably prompted its chief rival, Apple, to make a larger iPhone, analysts said. The two handsets, fitted with screens of 5.8 and 6.2 inches, include Samsung's upgraded digital assistant Bixby, competing in a crowded field that includes Apple's Siri, Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. (Timothy A. Clary/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images) Overall, analysts said that Samsung pulled off a strong performance Wednesday and possibly set the tone for a more innovative smartphone cycle in 2017. “We are seeing some great design innovation from Samsung this year and expect the same from Apple,” said Jefferson Wang, senior partner at IBB Consulting, in an email. The phones released this year — with curved screens and big displays — should set a new template for the next couple of years, he said. In terms of innovation, Samsung's new phones pick up where the company had left off. As expected, the S8 and S8 Plus ditch the physical home button to give the touch screen as much real estate as possible. As with Samsung's Galaxy Edge devices, the phones also have displays that curve over their sides. The new devices have a variety of security features — an iris scanner, fingerprint scanner and facial recognition sensor — that can be used to secure the phone as well as other services, including Samsung Pay and Samsung Health. The phones will go on sale April 21, on AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint. While prices may vary by carrier and payment plan, the suggested price of the Galaxy S8 is $720; the Galaxy S8 Plus will cost $840. The screens for the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus measure 5.8 inches and 6.2 inches, respectively, but are slim enough to fit in one hand without feeling too bulky. Samsung also introduced a new mode, DeX, that allows the phones to plug into a monitor and special charging dock and perform desktop functions such as email and even Microsoft Word programs. The dock is sold separately. Samsung revealed more about its new digital assistant, Bixby. The voice-controlled assistant is integrated with the phones' cameras so users can snap pictures of products, which Bixby will then search for online. The assistant can figure out your location from a picture and look for restaurants or other attractions nearby. Unlike its closest competitor, Apple's Siri, Bixby can also fully control some apps by voice — but right now nearly all of those apps are made by Samsung. (Hayley Tsukayama/The Washington Post) Bixby is still not as comprehensive as many analysts had hoped. “Samsung’s initial Bixby implementation falls short of its goal of being a comprehensive AI assistant because of weak app integration and limited voice compatibility,” said Ian Fogg, analyst at IHS Markit, in an email. Until Samsung expands the assistant — and supports languages apart from English and Korean — it won’t be competitive, Fogg added. In fact, he said, many users may not even choose it for the S8, which also ships with a Bixby competitor, Google Assistant. The Galaxy S8 provides hints of Samsung's ambition to be a major player in the smart-home market. The company introduced an app called Samsung Connect, which shows users a unified list of all their smart devices, and lets them control them from the phone. As might be expected, the products listed in the demo, including a refrigerator and a robot vacuum, were all made by Samsung. That was a nod to the broad base of products that Samsung makes, which gives it an advantage over Apple and Google — the latter is its partner on Android but also its smart home rival. The company also continued to tout its progress in virtual reality, which it views as a complement to its mobile-phone business. Samsung introduced a new version of its 360-degree camera, the Gear 360, which is now able to live-stream video while recording. Samsung's new features should also push Apple, analysts say. “The consumer is the big winner in all of this. We have genuine first-class competition among major players,” said Thomas Cooke, professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

We also get a look at progress at the site with a new video walkthrough this week. Sony A6500 Apple was granted approval for the project back in November 2015, and 9to5Mac reported that demolition of the previous site and new construction for the upcoming flagship Apple Store was underway last December. Today the Chicago Tribune has the latest renderings from Apple of what the upcoming retail space is expected to look like when the project is complete. The photo at the top shows the street level view of the glass structure with a massive rooftop centered in an open public space. Foster + Partners, the same firm behind the new Apple Park campus design, is also responsible for what the Tribune says is a $27 million project, although the store still has no target opening date. New photos included in the report do show further progress since we last checked in including the curved glass edges in place and the roof being installed this week. The Tribune even says construction workers signed the final support beam used for the new Apple Store. Compare the on-the-ground progress to Apple’s latest vision for the upcoming Apple Store: NBC also got an exclusive video walkthrough of the site this week with Foster + Partners: Zac Hall @apollozac Zac covers Apple news and product reviews for 9to5Mac, contributes to 9to5Google, and hosts the weekly 9to5Mac Happy Hour podcast.

By Serenity Caldwell, Rene Ritchie Saturday, Mar 25, 2017 at 1:00 pm EDT 16 Comments Apple offers three different iPad models in four different sizes: Here's how to pick the right one for you! Updated March 2017: Completely rewritten to focus on the new iPad models. The iPad line has certainly evolved since the one-iPad-fits-all pitch from 2010: We now have iPads in three sizes and four models, ranging from baseline iPad minis to high-end 12.9-inch iPad Pros. If you're considering a new tablet for your lifestyle, we've broken down the factors worth discussing — and the ones worth tossing aside. See at Apple Meet the iPad line Apple's 2017 iPad lineup consists of 4 different models: 9.7-inch iPad: $329-$559, 32GB & 128GB 7.9-inch iPad mini 4: $399-$529, 128GB 9.7-inch iPad Pro: $599-$929, 32GB - 256GB 12.9-inch iPad Pro: $799 - $1129, 32GB-256GB The 9.7-inch iPad replaces the aging iPad Air 2 and all prior full-size iPads; it's being positioned as Apple's new budget and education model — the option for those who don't need the extra bells and whistles of the Pro line. You can get the iPad in either 32 or 128GB A9 versions along with optional cellular service, but it doesn't come with many of the Pro's perks: You can't use the Apple Pencil or Smart Connector accessories, nor is the screen equipped with wide color or an antireflective coating. You'll also miss out on quad speakers, the faster A9x chip, better cameras, and LTE Advanced service. The iPad mini 4 is Apple's last relic of the 7.9-inch tablet market: While still being offered for sale, the mini hasn't been given the same care and attention as its full-sized brethren. The product line has been slimmed to two 128GB models (Wi-Fi only and Wi-Fi + Cellular), and the tablets keep their aging A8 chips and M8 co-processors. Like the 9.7-inch iPad, the mini misses out on all of the iPad Pro's top-tier features, including Apple Pencil usage and the Smart Connector port. The 97.-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros head up the top end of Apple's lineup: They sport the "Pro" moniker thanks to their gorgeous laminated screens, A9x processors, and support for the Apple Pencil and Smart Connector accessories. But for all their similarities, they have their differences, too. The 9.7-inch has the company's latest and greatest tablet technology inside it, with a True Tone display that features Wide Color (P3). It also sports a 12-megapixel rear camera with P3 color capture, a True Tone quad flash, larger 63-megapixel panoramas, and the option to take Live Photos; it also offers 4K video recording and 1080p slow motion. The 5-megapixel FaceTime camera is also superior to the 12.9-inch's 1.2-megapixel sensor, and the smaller iPad Pro offers the sometimes-blinding Retina Flash screen technology when taking front-facing photos. The 9.7-inch iPad also sports more LTE bands for the LTE Advanced network (23 to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro's 20). And finally, the Cellular-only model comes with both an embedded Apple SIM and an insertable Nano-SIM, to allow quick switching between networks. While the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is lacking some of these whiz-bang features, it more than makes up for it in a gorgeous screen, faster A9x chip (1.9x CPU and 3.1x graphics compared to the 9.7-inch Pro's 1.85x faster CPU and 2.7x faster graphics), and Lightning-to-USB3 fast charging. Whatever your choice of iPad model, you'll get iOS 10 and Apple's App Store on every single model, along with all of the iPad's compatible 64-bit applications. iPad models and price points The eponymous "iPad" is now Apple's cheapest model, coming in at $329 for 32GB of storage, though the iPad mini 4's $399 price point might arguably be the better buy if you're primarily worried about storage (given its 128GB of space). On the highest end, you have Apple's Wi-Fi + Cellular 12.9-inch iPad Pro maxed out to 256GB at $1129. It's a big range, and it can feel a little daunting to your pocketbook when you're not quite sure what you need or want. That said, don't be afraid to consider the higher-priced Pro models if they have the features that you want: If you keep your iPad over the course of a year or two—even three or four—that distributed difference can be as little as $5 or $10 a month over the course of those years. Sure, the upfront cost is still going to sting — but the long term viability may make a bigger screen, Apple Pencil usage, faster chipset, or other options more affordable than you think. Bottom line If you just need a bare necessities iPad without costly bells and whistles, the new 9.7-inch base model iPad is a great starting tablet, and storage buffs just need to pay $100 more to upgrade to the 128GB model. The iPad mini 4 has the second lowest price of the line, but fewer features than its fellow tablets: It comes with a slower A8 chip, for one. If you're price-conscious and want more storage, we'd recommend the $100 128GB 9.7-inch iPad upgrade over the $79 extra to buy an iPad mini 4 over a stock iPad. If money is no object, the iPads Pro are not just top-of-the-line, but state-of-the-art. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro has the benefit of being both slightly cheaper and packed with many of the most exciting new features, including Wide Color, but splurging for the 12.9-inch is a great option for those who really covet that bigger size and Lightning-to-USB3 speed. Display size Every Apple iPad comes with a Retina display: They're packed with pixels and look great, even when you're close up. iPad mini 4 has a 7.9-inch screen and 2048x1536 resolution, which works out to 326 pixels per inch (ppi). The stock iPad and iPad Pro both have a 9.7-inch screen at 2048x1536, which works out to 264ppi. And finally, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro has a 12.9-inch screen at 2732x2048, which is the same 264ppi. Officially, the iPad mini 4 has the highest pixel density — it's the same number as the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 — because the same number of pixels as the other iPads has been shrunk to an even smaller size. In the real world, this density isn't particularly noticeable when compared to its fellow iPad models, but avid readers may prefer it over the less-dense 9.7-inch iPad. With the exception of the 9.7-inch stock iPad, all models now include laminated displays and an antireflective coating, which make the pixels look almost like they're inside the glass. When it comes to overall display functionality, however, the iPads Pro take the prize: They include custom timing controllers to adjust the refresh rate for the Apple Pencil, and the 9.7-inch version supports the wider DCI-P3 gamut — similar to many digital movie theaters — for exceptionally vivid and accurate colors. Perhaps even more impressively, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro's True Tone technology uses two four-channel ambient light sensors to read the color temperature of the room and ensure the display matches it; this makes the whites look truly white to your eyes, rather than the harsher blue tones of traditional screen technology. Bottom line The 9.7-inch iPad Pro is the all-around display winner, with its laminated anti-reflective P3 color and True Tone screen, though the 12.9-inch iPad Pro's gigantic Retina display is nothing to shake a finger at. If it's heavy reading or editing you're planning to accomplish with your iPad, however, the iPad mini's 326 ppi-density screen may be the better option. The 9.7-inch stock iPad isn't anything special in the screen department when compared to its siblings, but nor is it unimpressive — it still packs a 264 ppi Retina display and an oleophobic coating to reduce fingerprints. Weight and size The iPad mini 4 is the lightest iPad Apple makes. At 0.65 pounds, it's around two-thirds the weight of the 0.96 9.7-inch iPad Pro and 1.03 pound stock iPad, and less than half the weight of the 1.57 pounds 12.9-inch iPad Pro. The lighter the iPad, the easier it is to use one-handed and to hold up for long periods of time. Likewise, size: It would take roughly two iPads mini 4 side-by-side to equal the size of a 12.9-inch iPad Pro. That's twice as much to fit into your bag and carry around. Bottom line If you want the lightest and smallest iPad you can buy, the iPad mini will fit in your bag (and your hand) with ease. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro is the next-lightest tablet, besting the stock 9.7-inch iPad model by 0.07 pounds, though in reality you shouldn't particularly notice the difference. Neither will fit into a small bag as easily as the iPad mini, but they're still easy to tote around in backpacks and satchels. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro is still portable, but it's riding the very edge: The tablet is closer in stature to a full-fledged laptop, and best for people who don't mind that size in their bag, or those who primarily plan to use it on a desk or couch. Colors Every iPad model comes in Silver, Space Gray, and Gold, but the 9.7-inch iPad Pro also sneaks in a Rose Gold option. The Silver, Gold, and Rose Gold all come with a white front face; Space Gray gets you a black front face. Sadly, no iPad comes in Apple's special RED edition — to our eternal sorrow. Bottom line If color is your primary buying impulse, you can mostly pick any iPad from the product line — unless you want Rose Gold. If pinkish colors you crave, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is your only solution in that department. Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard The iPads Pro have quite a few features going for them, but support for Apple's pressure-sensitive Pencil stylus and Smart Connector accessories are two of the biggest ones. The Pencil isn't just a stylus either: It not only feels like a real pen or pencil, it provides pressure sensitivity and can even tilt for things like shading. If you've been waiting for an iPad experience as good or better than a Wacom, the iPad Pro could offer it. Only the two iPad Pro models can use the Apple Pencil and various Smart Connector accessories — the stock iPad and iPad mini 4 are limited to traditional Bluetooth keyboards and capacitive styluses. Bottom line If you need the sensitivity and pressure controls that the Apple Pencil provides, the iPad Pro line is are the tablets for you. Who should get the iPad mini 4? The iPad mini 4 is almost identical to 2016's iPad Air 2. It's smaller and denser, with a 7.9-inch, 2048x1536 Retina display, and an Apple A8 instead of an Apple A8X chipset. The lightest iPad Apple has ever made, if you want a small but powerful tablet that you can easily take anywhere, can run split view multitasking, and has both 128 GB and gold finish options, you want the iPad mini 4. iPad mini 4 review see at Apple Who should get the 9.7-inch stock iPad The new 9.7-inch iPad is an updated entry-level option, sporting a 9.7-inch screen and 2048x1536 Retina display along with a really fast Apple A9 processor. It's far from the biggest or most powerful—that distinction belongs to the iPads Pro—but if you don't need a connected keyboard or Apple Pencil, you want a larger display that's still light and easy to carry around, can run split view multitasking, and has both 128 GB and gold finish options, you want the 9.7-inch iPad. See at Apple Who should get the 9.7-inch iPad Pro? The 9.7-inch iPad Pro takes everything that was great about the original and makes it even greater. It's faster and more powerful, it supports the Smart Connector and Smart Keyboard, and it supports the Apple Pencil. It's also got just about the best looking and most advanced display Apple's ever made, which is saying something. If you want the ultimate blend of power and portability, you want the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. 9.7-inch iPad Pro review See at Apple Who should get the 12.9-inch iPad Pro? The 12.9-inch iPad Pro takes the iPad to the next level. As big as a MacBook, it lets you see and work at full-scale, including two apps side-by-side at a scale that's almost 9.7-inches each. It supports the Smart Connector and Smart Keyboard, and it supports the Apple Pencil. That makes it not just a power-house, but a workhorse. If you want the ultimate canvas for creativity or productivity, you want the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. 12.9-inch iPad Pro review See at Apple Still undecided?

Bottom line: Don't spend money you don't have, but don't skimp if you don't have to. Your iPad will be one of the most often-used, most important possessions in your life for months and maybe years to come. Get as much iPad as you can reasonably afford, has the best balance of portability and power for you, and then enjoy! iPad Pro 12.9-inch iPad Pro Review 9.7-inch iPad Pro Review iPad Pro buyers guide iPad Pro FAQ iPad Pro news hub 12.9-inch iPad Pro discussion 9.7-inch iPad Pro discussion iPad Pro accessories Buy at Apple Reader comments Which iPad should you get: iPad Pro, iPad, or iPad mini? 16 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating suninmoon You're gonna need this guide. Apple's product lineup has gotten so cluttered and confusing, it's become a chore to make a choice. Five, count them, five iPads to choose from with a hundred variations. I don't think things have been this messy since 1997 when Steve came back to Apple and cleared the deck. Apple, stop reacting to the market and own it. Stop focusing on covering every single market niche and focus instead on releasing world changing products again. 0 1 year ago Reply DanRJones91 The only reason the lineup is cluttered is because they forgot that the only thing that differentiates the iPad Pro is the screen size. This new iPad is, in effect, an iPad Air 3. Pencil support does not an iPad Pro make. Sent from the iMore App 0 1 year ago Reply maximusaurelius I'm reading Steve Jobs biography right now, and recently read about him drawing 4 quadrants and saying 'this is simple. we need one product for each quadrant, that's it.' Apple needs to remember this, because cutting product lines cut costs, including layoffs , and Apple became profitable again after several years of hemorrhaging money. -1 10 months ago Reply alca1717 I totally agree. They need to stop with the 75 iPads now. I am in the market to purchase one and have been debating for about 3 months, and then they drop this new 'just iPad' bs on me? I can't make sense if any of it. Sent from the iMore App -2 4 days ago Reply Hobdell85 I have purchased an iPad Pro 9.7 128gb wifi & 4G for the portability for my job as a project manager. With the added extras of a Apple Pencil and keyboard it will certainly make using my iPad easier and faster. I currently have an iPad Air 2 16gb wifi & 4G which quickly fills up with photos and apps.

Even the spec bump isn't that important (a8x to a9 not a9x) Sent from the iMore App 0 4 days ago Reply PoisonMaps Agreed. The "new" iPad doesn't have a the anti-reflective coating of the iPad Air 2, and is also not laminated. This also makes it thicker and heavier, so it is a step back in those respects as well. The A9 is about 30% faster in single core, but only has 2 cores, whereas the Air 2 has 3 cores, so is about equal in multi-core performance. Unless you really need the slight increase in performance then the old Air 2 was a much better device. I don't blame Apple for releasing a cheaper model (as a developer I love the idea!) but I was hoping for something with the latest technology to replace my ageing iPad 3. The Pro was tempting, but the lack of USB3 and 3GB+ means that it isn't future-proof enough for me (I like to keep iPads for a long time). I don't think I have ever experienced such a long period when Apple haven't released a product that I have immediately thought "I must have that". They used to do it on a regular basis, but the last time for me was probably back in 2014 (both the iPhone 6 and the 5K iMac). All the rumours of a 10.5" iPad had my hopes up, only to be dashed by this cheap model that is basically cobbled together from old components. Hopefully this year's iPhone will break that depressing run... 0 2 days ago Reply YourMobileGuru It replaces it in the product lineup, but definitely wasn't an upgrade. Sent from the iMore App 0 1 day ago Reply macplusplus As stated in the article, iPad Mini (2 to 4) offers better display resolution. Once you get used to iPad Mini's crisper graphics and text, you won't get the same impression with larger iPads' lower resolution. I see this as a shortcoming of the iPad line and see an opportunity for growth there... 1 4 days ago Reply fidelisimo I own a 9.7" IPad Air 2 and love it! Purchasing the new 9.7" IPad would be a downgrade in my opinion. Nothing about was compelling. However, I would seriously consider purchasing the rumored 10.5" IPad if it kept the same form factor of the IPad Air 2. Sent from the iMore App 0 3 days ago Reply YourMobileGuru That's right it is a downgrade, in almost every meaningful way. Save your money for a new Pro model later this year.

We see still expecting updated Pro models later this year. They just weren't ready for this launch window. Sent from the iMore App 0 1 day ago Reply YourMobileGuru Wouldn't it have made more sense to call the new iPad, iPad SE since that's basically what it is? Barely modern specs in a 2 year old chassis, with half the things that make an iPad worth having stripped out to reduce costs?

There is a good chance the next Apple Watch may feature its very own cellular modem chip to allow more independence from its connected iPhone. The Apple Watch 3 is also speculated to receive LTE service and have compatibility with AirPods. Furthermore, a wireless charge feature may finally be included for the next iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and iPhone 8.     The source states, “We understand a model of the next Apple watch will include a SIM card, and therefore is likely to support LTE. We understand some issues remain, including battery life and form factor size, but significant progress has been made. Apple may be employing VOIP and data across a CAT-M1 connection for superior battery life. Apple will tout interoperability with the company’s AirPods to make and receive phone calls” It appears as though Apple has been hard at work to make significant changes and improvements for their upcoming ten year milestone.     In addition the source states, “We understand there are three versions: 4.7” iPhone7s, 5.5” iPhone7s Plus and 5.8” OLED iPhone 8 with all three versions offering wireless charging. Pegatron and Foxconn will manufacture the transmit pads. However, there is some skepticism regarding charging efficiency as it may take 3 hours to receive a full charge. Even though wireless charging is nothing new, the source adds the feature will take three hours to fully charge an iPhone.   The USB Type-C is not expected to replace the lightning port in the upcoming model just yet. There has yet to be confirmation Apple is prepared to lay these plans to rest in future developments. The home button may be completely omitted for the future of Apple iPhone designs. As of yet, the USB Type-C has not replaced the Lightning port, but Apple may very well still ponder doing so further down the road. As of now, Apple wishes to make a sort of hybrid by combining a bit of both technologies. The iPhone 8 OLED is expected to be designed to include an L-shaped battery which would allow more flexibility for its internal layout.   The iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus are expected to begin mass production this June. The same source believes the iPhone 8 will begin its production just two months later in August. We are likely to have an official announcement during Apple’s September presentation.

Box 964, Chiloquin, OR 97624 ← The Most Powerful Family You’ve Never Heard Of The Word From the Trenches – March 29, 2017 → After 12 tries, Apple finally approved an app for tracking drone strikes, then immediately deleted it Posted on March 29, 2017 by Wade Mashable – by Louise Matsakis Five years ago, Josh Begley, a data artist and editor at The Intercept, created a straightforward news app for iOS. It sent a push notification to your device each time a U.S. drone strike was reported by a news outlet. There’s a map that shows you where the drone strikes occurred and a log that keeps track of each one. That’s it. No pictures, no interviews. And yet, it was censored by Apple for years.  Begley attempted to bring Metadata+, which was originally called Drones+, to the App Store a dozen times.    It finally became available for download on Tuesday, and then was abruptly removed again five hours later. Begley received an email from Apple Tuesday afternoon, notifying him that his app was removed for containing content that “many users would find objectionable.” pic.twitter.com/sDDsKlFpSX — Josh Begley (@joshbegley) March 28, 2017 So why exactly did Apple remove Begley’s app? Depending on when you asked, Apple’s answer was different. The company first rejected Begley’s app because it “was not useful or entertaining enough,” and “did not appeal to a broad enough audience.” That seems like a strange excuse when apps like this one, which claims to blow candles out for you, get approved. You know, for that broad audience of people unable to breathe air out their mouths. The second rejection came because Begley used Google Maps images without the correct Google branding. The third because Metadata+ contained content that “many audiences would find objectionable.” So documenting extrajudicial killings by a world power is “objectionable,” but apparently options like Adult Naughty Sounds are not. Got it. Begley tried two more times to no avail. Then, at the end of 2013, Begley says he received a call from an Apple employee, who explained his app wouldn’t be approved if it focused narrowly on U.S. drone strikes. “If it’s going to be about that specifically, it’s not going to be approved,” the Apple employee told Begley at the time. Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment. Begley then resorted to a number of different methods. He changed the name of the name from Drones+ to Dronestream, then eventually to Metadata+. And he totally excluded the word “drones” from the app’s description. At one point, Begley completely removed the content and functionality from the app, planning to add it back later after it was approved. In 2014, Apple did approve Begley’s blank app, which he then backfilled with drone strike data. A year later, Apple mysteriously deleted Metadata+, again citing “excessively objectionable or crude content.” According to Begley, it had been downloaded over 50,000 times. pic.twitter.com/4jEnFbQgAT — Dronestream (@dronestream) September 27, 2015 When you look at Apple’s specific guidelines for App submissions, it’s difficult to see what part of Metadata+ violated them. Section 1.1, “Objectionable Content,” stipulates an app cannot include content that is “offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust or in exceptionally poor taste.” There’s an argument to be made that it’s upsetting to be repeatedly reminded that your government’s carried out covert war efforts across the globe that routinely kill more civilians than it cares to admit. But it’s hard to argue that’s Metadata+’s sole objective is to horrify you. For one, it doesn’t show a drone strike’s aftermath. There are no mutilated bodies. Not even destroyed houses or buildings. Since the beginning, Begley’s app has merely aggregated news about U.S. drone strikes in text format. It puts together widely available news reports—many of which are ostensibly available right in Apple’s own News app. Apple has allowed similar single-issue news apps in its store before, like Military News and NRA Magazines. So why did it give Begley such a hard time? It’s hard to tell, partially because Apple is so secretive. Each of the App Store’s over two million apps had to go through a complicated and strict application process to be approved. Apps get rejected all the time, for many different reasons. Apple’s review team is small and sorts through tons of apps. It’s possible that in haste, they erred on the side of caution when it came to Metadata+. We don’t know that for sure, since Apple has repeatedly declined to comment on how the app reviews process works. Regardless, the decision to suppress Begley’s app for so long is preventing Americans from learning more about their government’s war efforts. For the last 15 years, journalists, activists and attorneys have risked their lives in places like Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan to document the U.S.’s secret drone war. It feels unjust that a tech company like Apple has the power to repeatedly censor this information. Unfortunately, Apple censors its App Store all the time. In 2015, for example, it removed Civil War games from the App Store that featured the Confederate flag “in offensive or mean-spirited ways.” The tech giant has also regulated the App Store for reasons ostensibly tied to its business interests. Last year, it blocked an update to Spotify’s app, reportedly because it wanted to avoid competition for Apple Music. Metadata+’s long—and ultimately unsuccessful—struggle to reach the App Store is merely one example of how Apple chooses to police its walled garden. It serves as an important reminder of how tech giants get to dictate the kind of content they allow inside their ecosystems—effectively regulating the way you experience the internet. http://mashable.com/2017/03/28/apple-app-store-metadata-drones/#FITRQx8cYOqi Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

The two companies battled in court for years because of it. Not that we needed any proof beyond what we can see with our own eyes, those court battles uncovered a number of internal documents that showed the great lengths Samsung went to in its efforts to copy Apple. Remember the top-secret 132-page manual that explained how Samsung set out to copy Apple’s iPhone pixel by pixel? Of course you do. Samsung continues to take inspiration from Apple’s products to this day (that Jet Black Galaxy S8 sure is pretty), and it’s no mystery why. Apple copies things from other companies as well, but it’s still the top trend-setter in the consumer electronics industry. Of course, people tend to get carried away with their accusations that Samsung is copying Apple, and such is the case right now with the company’s just-announced Galaxy S8+. Don't Miss: 10 new Galaxy S8 features you won’t find on any iPhone Last week, popular Apple blogger John Gruber posted a quick note on Daring Fireball about a Galaxy S8 leak. “Looks like Samsung is beating Apple to the ‘hardly any chin or forehead’ punch,” Gruber wrote. “The top and bottom have bezels, but they’re so small Samsung couldn’t print their ugly logo on the front, finally moving past one of the worst aspects of every other Samsung phone to date.” Fair enough. But it was the last line of his post that made me raise an eyebrow: “Are they really going to call the bigger model the ‘Plus’? They’re really going to rip off Apple’s naming?” Hmm. I have seen similar comments made by a number of Apple bloggers over the course of the past few weeks, and also by Apple fans on Twitter and elsewhere. It’s obviously true that Apple differentiates its larger flagship iPhones with “Plus” branding, and the company has done so since 2014 when it debuted the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Of course, there’s just one tiny problem: Samsung had a phone named “Plus” all the way back in 2011. Last time I checked, 2011 came before 2014. Yes, back in July 2011 Samsung released the Galaxy S Plus, a lovely little phone powered by a cutting-edge single-core 1.4GHz Qualcomm Scorpion processor. It shipped with Android 2.3.3 and it even had WiMAX support! Anyway, the point is yes, Samsung has a long history of copying Apple — but there are enough real examples of Samsung’s plagiarism out there that people shouldn’t have to make things up.

Not yet rated By Gareth Beavis PC & Mac  Shares What is a hands on review? Our Early Verdict The Samsung DeX is a clever little dock that gives you a new choice when using your handset - it works easily and makes your phone as useful as a tablet as long as you have a spare monitor, keyboard and mouse handy. For Compact design Inbuilt cooling Against Slightly bulbous Slow disengaging for calls The Samsung DeX could be one of the biggest wins from the Galaxy S8 launch, with the clever little dock offering a whole new world for your Samsung phone. It's basically a small, squat puck that will allow you to turn your Samsung USB Type-C enabled phone (so, only the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus at this time, since the expiry of the Note 7) in a full desktop experience. It's the kind of thing that (as another, more esteemed, journalist pointed out) if Apple did it, the world would go crazy with hot takes on how Apple is trying to cripple its own iPad / Macbook business... where with Samsung it's likely to go under the radar. We don't know the explicit Samsung DeX price or release date just yet, and it probably won't be the cheapest device ever created by the South Korean firm. But it is impressive, and could herald a big change in the way we use our phones in the future - after all, they're getting to the point where there's more than enough power packed inside for them to function as actual computers, so why not do something like this?   Design The design of the Samsung DeX is, as mentioned, a small, bulbous puck that has a few ports shoved around the back. Simply flip open the top, slide in the Galaxy S8 to the dock (no wireless charging here... it's all through the dock as a connector) and you're away. The back of the device offers two USB ports, an ethernet socket and the HDMI output for a monitor. Sadly it seems you can't connect Bluetooth keyboards and mice to the phone, so you'll need to use the USB ports for that, but perhaps that's something Samsung can offer in the future.  It's also powered, so this isn't something you can take around with you... but then again, when would you also carry a monitor and keyboard? It's clear that your phone is going to get hot during this time, which is why Samsung has made the dock a cooler as well for the handset, dissipating heat while it's working overtime to get you working on documents a-plenty.   Interface Once the phone is slid in, you're met with the loading screen on the monitor. It's a slow, slow experience to get the phone to boot into the desktop mode in comparison to how swiftly apps open on your handset, but in terms of starting up a PC it's pretty rapid. You're greeted with a very Windows-like environment to use, and that's something that's been added into Android for a while (we've seen the same with devices like the Sony Xperia Z4 tablet in the past too).  However, now that many people are becoming used to using Google Docs and Sheets in the cloud, this is pretty much all you could need - with Android apps running there too. There's even a menu in the corner for all of your apps, like Windows' Start Menu, and it's very easy to move through and open whatever you need. During the demo, there were some jumps and lags in the smoothness of opening and closing apps, or the mouse moving windows around the page - it's not as slick as a top-end laptop by any means.  But at the same time, everything that was needed to be demonstrated - mostly opening documents, which is what most would largely do here - worked pretty much flawlessly. There's also the full suite of Microsoft Office apps on offer here, which means you've got all you need to work with anything that's been emailed to you on the go. Samsung also pointed out that the Samsung Galaxy S8 could run full Windows apps if connected to a remote desktop, as it's partnered with Citrix and Amazon Workspaces to allow you to see what's going on with your 'proper' computer and run it from your phone. This was probably the most impressive part of the demo, as once you put this remote desktop into fullscreen you're able to interact with your PC or Mac without any issues. It's unlikely that this would work seamlessly all the time, but it's something we're looking forward to trying out. The phone within  The cool thing about Samsung DeX is that your phone will still work exactly as normally in the background, with the handset still doing all its normal updating and receiving phone calls. The notification bar shows up in the bottom right-hand corner, meaning you can take and receive calls and (presumably, although not shown) create and reply to messages through the full keyboard. If you need to make the the call more private, a simple tug of the phone out the dock will let you take the conversation via the handset - although again this is a slow transition, with the phone needing about four seconds before you could begin speaking, which might be a long time for the person on the other end to wait. However, when the Galaxy S8 is reconnected, the desktop environment is unaltered, which is impressive again.   Early verdict We've been here before, with devices like this offered out by big brands and never taking off. But there's something about the Samsung DeX that seems to be a step forward... we were impressed. Perhaps it's the fact the world is much more au fait with working in the cloud, that Chromebooks are now an acceptable laptop alternative.  But there didn't seem to be much missing from what we'd need from a computer when connecting the Galaxy S8 with DeX, except perhaps the need for photo manipulation and that could be handled via a remote desktop. If only Samsung would make a laptop dock version of this, an empty shell that's powered by the phone... this would almost be the headline of the whole launch. But even now, Samsung has proved that the humble smartphone is a real PC rival, and the day where we toss our phones onto a wireless charging pad in the office and have the full range of computing needs instantly fire up is a step closer.  What is a hands on review? 'Hands on reviews' are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it. It may be just a few moments, or a few hours. The important thing is we have been able to play with it ourselves and can give you some sense of what it's like to use, even if it's only an embryonic view.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « New Samsung Patents Cover a Revolutionary 3D Vehicle Dashboard and a Strange Lightbulb-Like Smartphone | Main | Samsung introduced their iPhone 8 Challenger Today with Many New Features that will Ship on April 21 » March 29, 2017 Samsung Introduced the DeX Dock Turning Galaxy S8 into a Lightweight Desktop, Something Apple's iPhone 8 may match   Earlier this year HP led the way with their HP Elite x3 which combines PC-like power and productivity in a smartphone that is sleek and secure. Once at work or at home, you sit it in a special dock and it becomes your desktop. Today Samsung introduced their version of this called 'DeX' as noted in our cover graphic. The Dex docking station costs around US$160. The dock only works with the new Galaxy S8 because of its new 10nm processor with more power and up to 21% more graphics power. For now it works with various Android apps but they showed Microsoft's Office coming to Android which will make the S8 a natural for business and students.   Did Samsung's Galaxy S8 just leap frog Apple's iPhone with this move? – Perhaps to a certain degree temporarily.   Yet now that I've seen the HP Elite x3 and Samsung's DeX solution for pros, I'm now convinced more than ever that Apple's solution will be vastly superior. What solution is that you might ask? Apple's solution for pros may come in the form of an iPhone accessory that's notebook-like; a solution that was only revealed in a patent application last week.   Why wait until you get to the office or at home if you need to make an emergency edit to a document that your boss or teammates needs NOW? Apple's iPhone accessory is by far the superior docking solution and with Apple just introducing a new and more advanced filing system for iOS 10, the pieces of this puzzle are coming together rather quickly.   Then it came to mind that Apple had a couple of other interesting notebook-like solutions that the proposed iPhone accessory could adopt. The first covered an inductive charging solution that would recharge an Apple Watch conveniently while the other idea involved introducing a special new port built into the notebook device to assist in recharging an Apple Watch.      As an iPhone accessory, the body of the notebook-like shell could support quite the large battery considering that the brains of the device would be the iPhone 8. The battery would be large enough to power your iPhone all day and keep your Apple Watch charged conveniently as well.   I'm not going to speculate any further at this point in time, but now that I've seen Samsung pushing the Dex dock this morning, I'm more convinced than ever that Apple's recent patent filing revelation may be closer to reality than first thought. Apple now offers the iPad Pro as one hybrid solution and this could potentially be a second solution that might fit the bill better for some.   The excitement surrounding the iPhone 8 is already high to begin with, and the thought of a new hybrid accessory for the iPhone emerging that would provide a notebook-like experience just jacked up the excitement to a whole new level. And when you think of it, the rumors of Apple's Smart Connector being placed on the backside of the iPhone 8 supports the iPhone Accessory as well.   While there are a lot of ifs here, I think that the basic idea of the iPhone notebook-like accessory coming to market this year is one that's now almost bankable. Apple won't let the Galaxy S8 get the leap on them in any meaningful way with their new DeX smartphone dock and that's why theory of Apple's iPhone accessory has now in my view just taken a giant leap forward to probable in a flash.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

This year, things are changing: Android app distributors will leap ahead of the App Store, according to projections by analytics firm App Annie. In 2017, the App Store will generate $40 billion in revenue, while Android app stores run by Google and other parties will generate $41 billion, App Annie said. That gap is expected to widen in 2021, with Android app stores generating $78 billion and Apple’s store at $60 billion, according to the analytics firm’s report, which was released on Wednesday. TOP BUSINESS VIDEOS: Story continues below | Breaking news first: Sign in for newsletters The surge in revenue for Android comes largely from a growing number of consumers in China who prefer Android smartphones, which tend to be cheaper than iPhones, and are willing to pay for apps. In 2021, App Annie forecasts that there will be eight Android devices to every iPad or iPhone in China. “It’s really all about China,” said Danielle Levitas, senior vice president of research at App Annie. About 82 percent of the world’s smartphone users rely on the Android operating system, according to research firm IDC — far more than the 16 percent who use Apple’s mobile operating system, iOS. Despite Android’s larger global reach, people in emerging countries haven’t been as willing to pay for apps as luxury consumers who could afford an iPhone, which costs at least $649 in the U.S. That has changed in recent years, app developers say. “It’s 2017. That’s not really how the market is anymore,” said Russell Ivanovic, co-founder of Australian firm Shifty Jelly, which develops apps for smartphones. Ivanovic said the company’s $4 podcast app, Pocket Casts, has four Android customers for every one iOS customer. Alex Haro, president of family locator app Life360 in San Francisco, said one advantage of developing for the Android platform is that Google allows his firm to include an unlimited number of users in a test group. For example, his firm tested a feature that could detect whether a user had been in a car accident using the phone’s accelerometer and gyroscope, allowing the app to send an alert to a family member and call emergency services. With extensive testing, Life360 was “able to make the algorithm much better for the entire user base,” said Haro, whose company has received funding from Google. Apple’s iOS system also allows developers to test apps, but the tests are limited to 2,000 users, which Haro thinks is too small. Google, which oversees the Android operating system, said it has more than 1 million apps available for download at its Google Play store and that spending at its store increased more than 30 percent per buyer in 2015 compared to the year before. Google Play is available in more than 190 countries. “Google Play continues to be one of Google’s fastest growing businesses with tremendous momentum behind it,” the company said in a statement. Apple did not respond to a request for comment on App Annie’s report. Google Play represents $21 billion, or 51 percent, of the revenue of Android app store sales in 2017, according to App Annie. The rest of the sales comes from independent distributors, including some that sell apps in places like China, where Google Play isn’t available. Levitas from App Annie said she doesn’t believe the increasing Android app store sales will do much to sway which operating system developers build apps on first. Apple’s iOS still generates more money per device compared with Android, and “that alone means you don’t ignore iOS,” she said. Another factor going for Apple is that its App Store is available in China. Google pulled out of China in 2010, after cyberattacks and censorship demands made the company skittish. More people in China will purchase Android phones over iPhones because they are relatively affordable, analysts said. An Android phone can be purchased in China for roughly $300, said John Cui, assistant professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. Some Android app developers said it is challenging for them to enter the China market because the Google Play store isn’t there. They are reluctant to go through other distributors in China because they aren’t sure whether those stores will maintain the same standards as Google’s. “I so wish and plead and hope that one day the Google (Play store) will be available in China,” said Alok Kejriwal, CEO of online gaming company Games2win in India. “It’s a massive opportunity that we are all waiting to exploit.” Wendy Lee is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

At this point, however, it remains unclear whether the 10.5-inch iPad Pro will be announced later this spring, at WWDC 2017 in June, or in the fall or later, as rumors are lacking consensus. Japanese blog Mac Otakara previously said Apple would unveil its new iPad Pro lineup at a March event, but that rumor failed to materialize. Instead, Apple last week announced a low-cost 9.7-inch iPad, 128GB iPhone SE, new Apple Watch bands, and a (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus through its Newsroom. The latest rumor from DigiTimes claims Apple is planning to unveil the 10.5-inch iPad Pro at an early April event to "mark the inauguration" of its new Apple Park campus, which opens to employees next month. While this timeline could be correct, it's unlikely Apple would have shared such specific plans with the supply chain. Alexander believes an April launch "still looks somewhat tentative," but she said "the necessary elements are starting to come together," so it's possible Apple could do a limited spring launch in the United States and select other countries, followed by a wider rollout as production ramps up. A person with sources within Apple's supply chain told MacRumors that they still expect the 10.5-inch iPad Pro to launch in the spring. The person requested full confidentiality due to the nature of their position. It looks like Apple is doing the releases in a staggered fashion. I still expect a 10-inch-range iPad sometime in the spring. The supply chain is pretty clear that it is coming, maybe as soon as April.A handful of Apple analysts that we spoke to reiterated that a fall launch is more likely, however, and if volume production has yet to begin, then a launch later this year rather than sooner is certainly a possibility. Apple pundit John Gruber made a good point last week about why it would make sense for Apple to wait until at least October to announce the 10.5-inch iPad Pro: to avoid spoiling the design of the much-rumored iPhone with an edge-to-edge OLED display, which is expected to be announced in September. I think the most likely explanation is that Apple is working on a new edge-to-edge design iPad with a 10.5-inch display, but that it’s a 2018 thing, not a 2017 thing. Or, at the very earliest, a late 2017 thing — something they could unveil in October. […] Among all the other aforementioned things that don’t make sense regarding the rumor that a 10.5-inch iPad is imminent is the idea that the new design language would debut on an iPad, not an iPhone.But just how much of a spoiler the 10.5-inch iPad Pro might be remains to be seen, as rumors are conflicting about whether the tablet will have an edge-to-edge display or simply a narrow bezel design. It is also uncertain if Apple will remove the Home button on the 10.5-inch iPad Pro in line with the "iPhone 8." Back in August, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple would launch a 10.5-inch iPad Pro and new 12.9-inch iPad Pro in "2017," and he generally shares accurate information, so there is a good chance the tablets are coming at some point this year. He also predicted the low-cost 9.7-inch iPad. Just a few weeks ago, mobile marketing firm Fiksu spotted four new iPad identifiers in its device data. As it turns out, these model identifiers are not for the new 9.7-inch iPad, suggesting that they could be for Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi + Cellular versions of the 10.5-inch iPad Pro and a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Fiksu suggested the new iPad models could launch within a month, which would suggest a release by the end of April.

The new 10.5" device is the new flagship iPhone, the iPhone X XL Plus. It costs $1299 but ships with free AirPods so you don't have to try to hold the thing up to your ear. Rating: 17 Votes slimothy 3 days ago at 12:15 pm It's going to be the same footprint of a 9.7" iPad, but the screen will take up the whole front of the device, much like the iPhone 8. It will not launch until the iPhone 8 does. Rating: 8 Votes Azygos85 3 days ago at 12:12 pm I'd trust Ming-Chi Kuo. If he says a new 10.5" iPad pro is coming this year, it's coming this year.

Rating: 5 Votes MacsRgr8 3 days ago at 12:14 pm I find it hard to believe that the iPad Pro 9.7 will have the new form factor (i.e. 10.5), but the 12.9 won't. Surely the 12.9 is first in line to be updated, but there is no "evidence" of it, as there seems to be for this 10.5..? I call for the WWDC release, with (obviously) the A10X in both. Why WWDC? So Apple can show off Xcode on iPad Pro. Rating: 5 Votes dumastudetto 3 days ago at 12:06 pm I'm ready to order now. Let's start the pre-orders at least, I want to jump in at the front of the line. Rating: 5 Votes Relentless Power 3 days ago at 12:12 pm It just makes more sense to debut the iPhone with OLED before the iPad would. I think Apple will want to put all their marketing into the OLED iPhone before the iPad . My assumption is there won't be an April keynote and this purported 10.5 iPad is easily Fall 2017 or later. Assuming if production of this 10.5 iPad is slated for this month, then it would be at least six months before It would be available for resale.

Samsung takes its rivalry with Apple seriously. They are the two biggest smartphone makers by market share. Pachal writes: The Galaxy S8, codenamed "Dream," was three years in the making — about a year longer than most product development cycles, Samsung's Gaeyoun (Robert) Kim, vice president of global product planning for mobile, said in an interview at Digital City. ... The Dream may have double meaning, at least to Kim. In an unguarded moment, he said the Galaxy S8 was conceived as the "Dream to overcome Apple" — a bold admission from a company that's been repeatedly accused of lifting features from its rival in Cupertino, California. However, the company tried to walk back that statement, especially given the long-running patent lawsuits between the two companies, as well as the the public impression that Samsung copies Apple's features: Samsung reps later backpedalled Kim's comments, saying it was simply his own retroactive interpretation of the codename, and not an internal mandate, so make of that what you will. It's hard to mistake Samsung's latest for an Apple iPhone. The Galaxy S8 has lots of features that the iPhone 7 doesn't, including slim bezels, an iris scanner, and a dock that lets you access your phone's contents using a traditional PC setup (monitor, keyboard, and mouse). It also doesn't have a dual-lens camera, one of the big features Apple introduced last year on the iPhone 7 Plus. "In low-light conditions, [the iPhone 7 Plus dual camera] just uses the digital zoom, so what's the value of it?" Kim told Mashable. Mashable's feature on the Galaxy S8 is a fascinating look into a critical moment for Samsung, and is worth reading in full. This article was originally published on [url=LINK]Business Insider.

Apple reclaimed the top spot in Q4 in the wake of the disastrous S7 recall. Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Mar 29, 2017 at 1:24PM Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) has long offered features on its flagship phones that rival what Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has yet to make available on an iPhone. These include wireless charging and offering an SD card slot that allows users to expand the built-in memory. Those innovations, along with its sleek designs, helped Samsung become the global leader in smartphone market share, a title it lost in Q4 2016 due to its recall of the S7 after battery problems caused some devices to explode. In Q4, according to numbers from IDC, Apple reclaimed the top spot, partly due the success of its own iPhone 7, and in part because Samsung shipped 5.2% less devices after the S7 recall. Apple closed the year with a slim 18.3% to 18.1% market share lead, but Samsung was largely out of the game for the fourth quarter, at least with its most-heavily promoted model. That means with the launch of the S8, which the company introduced at an "Unpacked" media event Wednesday, Samsung has to do two things. For its core users, the ones more likely to switch to another Android phone than an iPhone, it has to show them that the S8 is safe. Customers who may defect from Apple will of course want to know that as well, but they will also want to see some sort of wow feature that iPhone does not offer. The S8 has an improved glass screen which covers the entire front of the device. Image source: Samsung.  Does the S8 bring the wow? Opening with a video set to The Beatles' "Across the Universe," with its iconic "nothing's gonna' change my world" line, Samsung showed a video of all the ways its phones and other devices have changed peoples' worlds. That certainly raised the bar for Samsung's President of Mobile DJ Koh, who kicked off the event. "As you all know, this has been a challenging year for Samsung," he said. "...Today, we are here to celebrate a milestone, not just the launch of a new device, but the beginning of a new way to explore the world." Again, that's a comment which raises expectations and Koh discussed for quite a while how phones have changed the world, as well as how Samsung's new models will continue that. The phone will come in two sizes, 5.8-inches (Galaxy S8) and 6.2-inches (Galaxy S8+). It will have an "an advanced 8MP F1.7 Smart autofocus front camera and 12MP F1.7 Dual Pixel rear camera," according to a press release and "the industry's first 10 nm chip, enabling heightened speed and efficiency." The phones also have improved displays and they will include the company's Bixby personal assistant for the first time. Those are all expected when any company releases a new phone and may be enough to win back lapsed customers, but are certainly not iPhone killers. Koh believes that it's how the new phone can be used that will set it apart. A galaxy of possibilities? "Your phone will be the gateway to all the devices in your home," Koh said. Some of the new features include: Stronger integration with the Gear VR headset, including a new controller, allowing for a more immersive experience. A new product called DeX which lets you use the S8 with a monitor and keyboard. Samsung Connect offers a single app to manage IoT devices. The voice assistant Bixby which does seem like a promising artificial intelligence interface, but so did Siri, Cortana, and a few others. The company pushed its Infinity Display, which is an end to end screen that covers the entire front of the phone, spilling onto its side. It's a higher screen-to-body ratio than on any phone the company has previously offered. "We've redesigned the smartphone from the inside out, to unbox the screen and unleash its potential," said Samsung Marketing Vice President Justin Denison. In addition to the improved display, the company has switched from a physical home button to a digital one. It's not an iPhone killer Samsung has built a pretty device that has predictable incremental changes consumers have come to expect when a company releases a new flagship phone. Denison did address the safety issue saying that it went through a battery check that was "beyond industry standards." That should bring back core customers, but none of the enhancements -- including being able to unlock your phone via facial recognition -- are truly surprising. The S8 and S8+ appear to be an improvement over the company's previous models, but Samsung does not deliver on saying that the phone would lead "a new era of smartphones." It's better, and it almost certainly won't blow up, but it's an evolution, not a revolution. The company will take pre-orders for both models in the United States at 12:01 EDT on March 30. It will be sold offered in Midnight Black, Orchid Gray, and Arctic Silver for an April 21 shipping date. Daniel Kline owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Video Why does the iOS 10 lock screen reveal so much? If you use a third-party streaming app to transmit from your Mac or iOS device to the fourth-generation Apple TV, you should check to see if the third-party developer has an update for its software before updating your Apple TV to tvOS 10.2. According to a report by AppleInsider, tvOS 10.2 including functionality that makes the Apple TV require device verification from an AirPlay streaming device. AppleInsider says that only Apple hardware can provide such verification. This new verification requirement can cause third-party streaming apps to not work. A blog post by Rogue Amoeba's Paul Kafasis states that tvOS 10.2 prevents the company's AirFoil app for Mac and Windows from working with the Apple TV. Rogue Amoeba recommends not updating to tvOS 2 until the company has a fix for AirFoil. The issue does seem to be resolvable, however. Software developer Squirrels has AirParrot, which allows users to stream media from one device to another. About two weeks ago, Squirrels released an AirParrot update that specifically states that it makes AirParrot compatible with tvOS 10.2. Apple released tvOS 10.2 last Monday. The update includes accelerated scrolling and the ability to swipe the far right side of the Apple TV remote to navigate specific indexes.

The update was available for a few hours before mysteriously disappearing, despite there being no noted outcry of users who had tried and failed to install the update on the devices. The update can still be installed through the standard process using iTunes, and seems to function fine on an iPhone 5c. In a related development, The Apple Post has discovered that the beta version of iOS 10.3.2 appears to end support for devices with 32-bit processors — like the iPhone 5 and 5c. The beta only contains restore images for 64-bit devices, hinting at the possibility that 32-bit devices are about to lose support. Apple announced back in 2014 that new apps or app updates would have to support 64-bit processors, and recent speculation has swirled around iOS 11 ending support for 32-bit devices. A warning dialog discovered by developers working with the iOS 10.3 beta stated that apps that have not been updated to include 64-bit support “will not work with future versions of iOS.” Given the new findings in the iOS 10.3.2 beta, the change could come sooner than expected. If so, the 4th generation iPad would also be unsupported as it features a 32-bit processor. Comments Well that's crap! I have a perfectly good phone that works great and now I won't be getting updates! I'll ride this phone till everything stops working.

Report: Free trials push Apple Music ahead of Pandora and Spotify on mobile usage Posted 12 hours ago by Ingrid Lunden (@ingridlunden) 0 SHARES Next Story Android co-founder’s new smartphone confirmed to run Android Spotify may be the reigning leader when it comes to the largest number of paid subscribers for a streaming music service, but it’s Apple that comes out on top when their respective audiences translate into monthly unique users, specifically on mobile. A report published this week from mobile analytics firm Verto has found that Apple Music attracted 40.7 million monthly unique users to its service in the U.S. in February. In comparison, Pandora came in at number two with 32.6 million users, and Spotify took third place with 30.4 million unique users for the month. Others ranking highly among music apps include iHeartRadio, SoundCloud and Amazon Music. iHeartRadio took the fourth slot, while SoundCloud, which last week secured a $70 million credit line, took the fifth slot. Verto also found that YouTube, which has a relatively small number of monthly unique users on mobile in the US — just 2.6 million users — had the “stickiest” service, with a 35 percent “stickiness” rating (dividing daily by monthly active users). Doing the math, this gives YouTube 875,000 daily active users on mobile in the US. Spotify also scored strong here, grabbing the highest number of listening sessions per month, at 51. (Google’s music properties, in fact, are not huge winners in terms of active users on mobile: Google Play ranked ninth among music apps in terms of monthly uniques in the US, with around 6 million.) Verto — a competitor to companies like ComScore that has raised around $24 million — says that it bases its figures on data is pulled from 20,000 SmartPanel users, people in the US and UK who opt-in to Verto’s on-device metering app on their phone, tablet and computer, letting it measure their usage on across devices, apps, and sites. This measurement data is then combined with calibration data that Verto collects from analytics and advertising platforms across nearly half a billion devices monthly. (Customers include Universal Music Group, EA Games, Johnson&Johnson, Microsoft and others.) The reason why Apple Music brought in the most monthly uniques on mobile in the US is an interesting surprise. According to Verto’s Connie Hwong, it comes down Apple Music’s three- month free trial, which more than doubles the amount of people who are listening using its app in the US: Apple last reported 20 million paying subscribers globally (not just the U.S.) for Apple Music in December 2016. While paying users tell one story about a company, and registered users tell another, active users is still a third. In the cases of Spotify and Pandora, which are older services, there is a pretty wide gulf between registered (and paying) users and people who actively open an app on their phones. Spotify earlier this month said that it had passed the 50 million mark for paying users globally; it hasn’t updated its overall users (including free) since last June, but at the time it said it had over 100 million. Verto’s figure of 30.4 million active users in the US in February is one-third the size of all of Spotify’s global registered users, and two-thirds the size of all paying users. Pandora today has 81 million users, but only around 4 million of them are paying for its Pandora Plus tier, which gives users some control over the music that is played, but without being a full on-demand service. The premium tier, which will have an on-demand component, was announced earlier this month. Verto’s figure of 32.6 million users is just under one-half the size of all users; and eight times as many paying users — a proportion that Pandora is under a lot of pressure to grow with the introduction of that $9.99 premium tier. What’s interesting to me here is how Apple Music’s free tier seems to be doing so well here. There are a few reasons why that might be the case. For starters, Apple Music is preloaded on all iPhones, making the service that much easier for users to try out. Then, there is Beats 1, Apple’s radio service. In a profile in the Verge, Apple Music executive Larry Jackson described Beats 1 as “the biggest radio station in the world” (although Apple declines to give actual usage numbers). Robert Kondrk, another Apple exec, pointed specifically to its strength as an onboarding tool for Apple Music (incidentally eating into SoundCloud’s business in the process), specifically around exclusive content that’s streamed on Beats 1 that then links to streams in Apple Music: “Now an audience which once went to SoundCloud to hear the latest Drake music heads to Beats 1 first.” Kondrk describes the relationship between Apple Music and Beats 1 like an amusement park — once you’re inside the Apple Music app to listen to Beats 1, it’s only natural you’ll stay in it to stream the songs afterward.” There’s also the novelty aspect of a new app: users download apps but often stop using them after a while, and perhaps the same may go for a certain proportion of people who have downloaded older music apps. Conversely, there may be some curiosity about the newer Apple Music app and people’s interest in trying it out. But the same can’t be said for every new entrant music app. Tidal, the streaming service co-owned by Jay Z and with a roster of other big music artists among its backers, hasn’t been entirely forthcoming about how many users it has: Verto cites just 100,000, while a report in January, near the time when Sprint disclosed a 33% stake in the business, said the number was closer to 850,000, and Tidal itself has said it’s 3 million. Whatever the actual global number is, Verto said that the users Tidal tend to be dedicated, with a “stickiness” rating of 22 percent, the same as Amazon Music, with an average number of listening sessions for the month at 46, just behind Spotify’s 51. The focus on mobile in this report partly comes out of the fact that mobile — and specifically the mobile phone — represents the most popular platform for digital music at the moment: The message for music app developers seems to be fairly clear: if you are a music app that wants to continue to grow your user base, you need a mobile app that’s pulling in active listeners on a very regular basis. It points to why we are seeing the likes of Spotify launch so many different variations on the concept of recommendation and discovery services, and why we’ll continue to see more of these from the rest of the field. “For streaming music services that offer on-demand music libraries, a vast catalog is no longer a selling point,” Verto writes. “It’s a given.” Featured Image: TechCrunch 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Digital music Description Digital music was launched in 2008 Website http://www.believedigital.com Full profile for Digital music Verto Analytics Founded 2013 Overview Verto Analytics is a pioneer in digital multi-screen media measurement.

No reason was given for the retraction, but this could be related to a previous report claiming the Cupertino giant is likely to end support to the said iPhones along with the fourth-generation iPad.  On Wednesday, Apple Insider found out that iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c owners no longer have access to the OTA update for their devices. When Apple released iOS 10.3, the relatively dated handsets were among the smartphones that received the OTA update. The Apple-centric news site pointed out how this move doesn’t make sense given that there have been no complaints about problems with the software update since its launch. Moreover, no reports about failings due to the 32-bit processors in the two phones have been published online.  Owners of 2012’s iPhone and 2013’s iPhone 5c can still update their devices to the latest iOS 10 update, but they now have to download it through iTunes on their Mac or PC device. The over-the-air update was more convenient since it only required users to download the files needed for the update directly into their handsets prior to installation. Now they have to connect their phones to a computer with a Lightning cable just to obtain a copy of the updated operating system. Previously, IBT reported about Apple possibly ending support for the iPhone 5, 5c and the fourth-generation iPad soon. A recent discovery in the iOS 10.3.2 beta that was released around the same day as iOS 10.3 shows that the next point update will only contain support for apps built on 64-bit technology. Because the three devices are housing chipsets with 32-bit process, it is assumed that they will not be receiving future updates anymore.  Apple’s iOS 10.3 is the latest major update for the iPhones, iPads and the iPad touch. It comes with a new Apple File System, the Find My AirPods feature and many other under-the-hood improvements and bug fixes. Users who plan to update their device to the new software update are advised to do an encrypted backup prior to installing iOS 10.3. The iPhone 5c does not have access to the iOS 10.3 OTA update anymore.

Justin Denison, senior VP-marketing for Samsung Electronics, speaks during the Samsung Unpacked event in New York on Wednesday. Credit: Mark Kauzlarich/Bloomberg Most Popular Samsung knows it needs to get its new flagship smartphone right. So apart from making sure the gadget it revealed at an event on Wednesday won't cause bodily harm, the company packed it with a plethora of new features: taller height, a curved screen, encrypted facial recognition, deeper display colors, system-wide voice control and the ability to turn into a desktop computer. The Galaxy S8 comes in two sizes, a standard 5.8-inch display model and a Plus version with a 6.2-inch screen. Both are larger than the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the lineup's main competition -- until Apple rolls out its 10th-anniversary iPhone later this year. The marketing deluge around all these models should make 2017 a year to remember in smartphone advertising. Related Stories The Unlikely Partnership Between Samsung's Galaxy S8 and Pinterest In line with smartphone trends, Samsung's new devices feature slimmer bezels alongside the display and are curved on all four corners. Pre-orders will begin soon after the unveiling, ahead of the S8's April 21 release. It comes in five colors: black, gold, blue, silver and gray (although Samsung has fancier names for them than that, a la Apple's description of its pink phone as "rose gold"). The S8 represents Samsung's biggest prospect for a turnaround after the Note 7 debacle last year. The bigger-sized smartphone debuted to positive reviews, only to be killed off after some units showed a tendency to catch fire and explode, forcing the South Korean manufacturer to yank the product off shelves. The crisis cost the company more than $6 billion and its global lead in smartphone sales. Samsung accounted for 17.8% of global smartphone sales in the last three months of 2016, slightly less than Apple, according to Gartner. While Samsung may be targeting Apple, it also faces challenges from up-and-coming rivals such as Huawei and Oppo, especially in China, the world's biggest smartphone market. "We must not only win back customers' trust, but also the high expectations that they have always held for Samsung," said Lee Young-hee, exec VP of Samsung's mobile business. "We have put our utmost effort to provide customers with near-perfect devices to earn back their trust." Also casting a shadow over the S8's debut is the trial of Jay Y. Lee, the Samsung group's heir apparent and de facto chief, who was arrested on bribery and embezzlement charges stemming from a national influence-peddling scandal. He has denied any wrongdoing. Still, even with the Note 7 imbroglio and legal troubles, Samsung shares have been trading near record highs, thanks to a robust semiconductor business. "With the new Galaxy S8, Samsung wants to restore its brand image back in the market as a technology leader after the Note 7 incident," said Jusy Hong, principal analyst for mobile devices at market researcher IHS Markit. Samsung's corporate logo is now gone from the front of the device, making room for a taller, 18.5:9 ratio screen, which the company is calling the Infinity Display. The new dimensions mean the thin black bars that typically surround widescreen videos can be eliminated, making them look bigger when played. The home button, with vibrating feedback, is integrated into the bottom of the screen. On the software side, users can now clip specific apps to the top of the screen so that, for instance, they can compose emails while reading a web page. The S8 will also feature a digital assistant that studies its owner's activities to offer helpful tips and information, seeking to challenge Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa. Called Bixby, Samsung's service can be activated via the phone's side button. The system has a few parts: one is a standard, Siri-like voice control view, another is a list view of upcoming calendar appointments and reminders. The feature is also integrated with the camera so that it can identify objects like buildings, or a particular bottle of wine. Users can operate many of the phone's functions via voice instead of the touchscreen. While some previous Galaxy models let users unlock their device using a facial scanner, the S8 is the first Samsung phone to encrypt facial data. Combined with iris and fingerprint scanning, that can be used to offer more security for mobile banking and other sensitive applications. Another new trick: the new Samsung phones can essentially become a full-blown desktop computer via a separately sold docking station called the DeX (an idea introduced by Motorola in 2011). The phone will add upgraded front and rear cameras, and continue to include wireless charging. The camera app will include built-in Snapchat-like stickers that can be placed over images. Unsurprisingly, Samsung is touting the safety of the S8's battery, given that the cause of the Note 7 fires was due to faulty battery design. A Samsung TV commercial released earlier this year shows engineers testing batteries by drilling a hole and apparently heating them in what the company called an "eight-point battery safety check." The company says the standard S8 model has a 3,000 mAh battery while the Plus version has a capacity of 3,500 mAh. "Success isn't going to come overnight for the S8 and it'll be a while before consumers feel confident the phone has no problems like the Note 7," said Koo Chang-hwan, who researches corporate brands at Seoul-based Korea Reputation Center. -- Bloomberg News In this article: CMO Strategy Consumer Electronics Digital Mobile Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2017 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17

A few weeks ago, the Cracking the Code team sat down for a thrilling and by turns terrifying livestream with the amazing Michael Angelo Batio.  We say terrifying, not just because Batio's famous blade-like precision has lost none of its cutting edge after all these years, but also thanks to the nerve wracking panic of capturing it all as a live broadcast right as it happened. Here's how we did it. Roll Camera As with microphones, preamps, and converters in audio recording, the resulting video quality of any live broadcast will depend greatly on the quality of the video signal you feed it. For our master studio shot, we used one of the best of the current generation of full-frame, 4K-capable mirrorless cameras, the Sony A7S II: For the closeup shots, we employed two Panasonic GH4s, a smaller "micro four-thirds" sensor camera that was one of the first to bring a 4K image and video-centric feature set to the prosumer market. Though it was introduced more than three years ago, the GH4 still delivers what you'd consider a cutting-edge picture when it is properly exposed, and particularly when its 4K output is downscaled to a more broadcast-friendly 1080p HD, as we did for our livestream: In fact, despite their branding as "HD" cameras, previous generation DSLRs like the ubiquitous Canon 5D and Rebel lines don't actually deliver 1080 HD-levels of detail, but rather something closer to 720 vertical lines of resolution. The more detailed 1080 version of the HD format is referred to euphemistically as "full HD" in videography parlance, presumably to leave some marketing wiggle room for the 720 format to share the HD moniker. And while 720 is indeed greater than the 480 vertical lines of SD television and DVDs, and thus, still defensibly "high-definition", the difference between consumer 720 and professional 1080 will be obvious to even a casual observer who compares their weekend soccer practice footage with the hyper-detailed look of the typical high-definition sports broadcast. Television sports are still, for the most part, Full HD. They are also occasionally Full HD broadcast as 720, further complicating comparisons, but nevertheless preserving some of the hyper-detailed look of the original footage through intelligent downscaling algorithms.  It's just that consumer cameras, regardless of format, are often neither. Even held steady on a tripod and filming a static subject, DSLRs like the Rebel are lucky to deliver 720 lines of actual resolution, regardless of the number of vertical lines in the files they record. Their smudgy image may be flattering for closeups, but often fail to deliver that "you are there" feeling on detailed wide shots like you'll get from an NFL broadcast. Capture Big, Deliver Small Suffice it to say that not all HD is created equal. In fact, you may be surprised to learn how it is created in the first place. Many of the best HD cameras, like the much-vaunted Arri Alexa used nearly ubiquitously on Hollywood and television productions, benefit from capturing images with greater-than-HD levels of detail. Even Canon's own excellent C300 professional HD camera, which was released back in 2011, utilized a sensor which captured 4K for certain colors, and then strategically reduced that resolution later on in the image processing pipeline. For various technical reasons better explained by an electrical engineer than a guitar player, this process produces an image which is generally more detailed than that produced by HD cameras which employ only HD-capable image sensors. It also reduces noise and increases color bit-depth at the same time. All of this assists in producing that surreal sense of "looking through a window" clarity that the best modern video cameras offer. From an audio perspective, you can think of this a little like the difference between recording in 44.1khz versus 96khz. Various technical processes, like the low-pass filtering necessary to prevent frequency aliasing, make for arguably more natural treble rolloff in a 96khz pipeline than even the best 44.1khz pipeline. In fact, video cameras often employ low-pass filters for precisely the same reason, to prevent fine details in the scene, such as the fabric weaves in clothing and upholstery, from producing false patterns and color in the resulting image. The blurring effect of these filters will be less noticeable when reducing a larger image to a smaller one for final delivery. Similarly, even in the CD era, recording 24 bits and delivering 16 bits was the easiest way to optimize the quality of the final mix. A select few of your listeners in 2007 might have been able to play back 24-bit resolution files. But even if your audience listened primarily on consumer-grade 16-bit equipment, most of us in audio production moved to 24 bits for reasons of gain staging, dynamic range, and noise floor, and never looked back. To 4K or not to 4K? The bottom line is that capturing in 4K and delivering in HD produces an image which beats the pants off HD images from even a few years ago. Ironically, the converse is also true. Televisions are rapidly becoming 4K-capable, and at reasonable price points to boot. But an HD image which truly approaches 1,080 lines of vertical resolution will still look amazing to most viewers, even after upscaling by the television itself to fill its 4K real estate. The reason is that there is only so much detail the human eye can perceive while sitting a given distance away from a video display. And while video professionals often debate what that actual figure is, it's clear that we're getting closer to it, for less money, than ever before. Compute! But what do you plug those cameras into? Our studio is powered by a late-generation Retina 5K iMac with a quad-core 4ghz i7 processor, a maxed out video card, and a terabyte of internal SSD storage. If nothing else, the slim configuration options offered by Apple make this kind of decision-making easy. In our experience on the bleeding edge of audio and video production, your dollar goes the farthest when maxing out the configurator on Apple's website and hitting the "Add to Bag" button. The good news is that even this future-proofing approach toward hardware purchases will not necessarily break the bank. We adopted the above machine from foster care at Apple, as an officially refurbished item. In other words, the machine arrived fully warrantied by Apple itself, but sneaking in just under the $3K mark. This was a savings of several hundred bucks compared to its closed-box brethren. Interfacing the Music So we already knew what kind of compute power we were working with. The question was how to address it. And the answer, again, proved simple by virtue of the scarcity of available options. Multi-channel audio interfaces are the norm in recording studios, but there are relatively few off-the-shelf devices capable of capturing multiple HD video signals simultaneously, and even fewer that can handle multiple 4K video signals. So the bulk of the prosumer market is single-channel interfaces connected by either Thunderbolt or USB. Of those, Magewell's USB line of HDMI video capture interfaces are the most plug-and-play choices as of this writing, requiring no drivers on either Windows or Mac, and accepting a wide range of resolutions and frame rates. In fact, despite their tiny physical size and convenient reliance on USB bus power (look Mom no plugs!), the Magewell devices do all their downscaling internally, delivering to the host computer a ready-made 1080p image that requires no extra effort from the CPU or GPU. Going Live Now that our video signals are inside the computer, we need a way of switching between them and shipping them on their way to the intertubes. After several months of testing broadcast applications, we settled on Mimolive from Boinx Software: For musicians considering a livestreaming setup for performance or teaching, it's worth a serious look. At a few hundred bucks a year subscription, Mimolive's feature set simply cannot be equaled for less than thousands of dollars worth of business-class broadcast hardware and software. And its ease of use, considering the number of features it allows a single operator on a single machine to perform, doesn't exist at any price point that we are aware of. Specifically, Mimolive functions like a DAW for video, accepting camera inputs, switching between them or mixing them in artful ways, and streaming the resulting video output to the platform of your choice, be that YouTube, Facebook, or otherwise. This much can be done with any of a number of leading broadcast applications. Telestream's Wirecast is a popular choice, and the one to which we directly compared Mimolive. Even though the output of both Mimolive and Wirecast is determined in large part, again, by the video signals you feed them, Mimolive's image output seemed notably more detailed. We can't pinpoint precisely why that is. Both applications leverage hardware-accelerated H264 encoders on the GPU for image processing, so we can't say why one application would produce a more detailed HD frame than another. But what we can say is that we consistently preferred the Mimolive image to the Wirecast image in our tests. Hunting the Skype-A-Saurus But we didn't just want to film the studio with lots and lots of pixels. We also wanted to take live calls from viewers. In fact, due to its nefarious complexity, the challenge of cobbling together all the hardware and software necessary to do this via Skype has infamously been dubbed "building a Skype-a-Saurus" by the video production community. Our initial attempts at solving the call-in problem involved running both Wirecast and Skype on the same machine, and feeding the output of one to the other in the form of a virtual video camera feed. This is a built-in facility that Wirecast offers precisely for this purpose, i.e. feeding its master video output to other applications where it will appear like a webcam input. But this process ate up precious CPU cycles, and still left us at the mercy of Skype's draconian compression algorithms. As such, we were never able to get better than choppy frame rates, macro-blocky video, and low-bitrate, "underwater"-sounding audio. Aggressive compression on audio signals might be fine for the next time you discuss the plummeting figures at your quarterly sales meeting. But for musical sounds it's positively torture to listen to. Do you want your livestream to sound like a 128kbps Napster mp3 circa the year 2000? Try a Skype call for truly retro musical audio quality. Feeding the Skype video into Wirecast was equally dreadful, requiring an active screen capture of the Skype portion of the desktop display, eating up even more CPU. And woe betide he who accidentally moves the PornHub window in front of the Skype window. (Not that I would ever do such a thing.) That this worked at all, even with copious dropped frames on the broadcast output, was at least a rousing testament to Moore's Law. Upgrading to Business Class Microsoft, the current owner of Skype, does offer a business-class solution for all this called Skype TX, through which an external hardware box costing upwards of four or five thousand dollars takes all the Skype calls, and outputs those video feeds back to the broadcast machine.  Not only does this external box require its own operator, but those video feeds then become additional "cameras" in your video switching setup, requiring their own Magewell-type video interfaces. And those callers will also need their own audio monitoring "mix-minus" feeds so they can hear what the hosts are talking about without also hearing themselves. All that being said, removing Skype from the broadcast machine also removes its CPU hit and potentially increases its frame rate and overall video quality. So... we took the hint and tried something similar. Divide and Conquer We put Skype on another machine, a late-generation Mac Mini. We captured its screen with a Magewell and fed it into the broadcast machine like a camera. We also ran Wirecast's master output right out of the broadcast machine entirely, through a Blackmagic Intensity Shuttle interface, and then back into yet another Magewell device on the Mini. On the Mini, we selected the input Magewell as the camera in Skype, so the caller could see what was going on in the studio. On the audio side, we created a setup in Logic Pro X utilizing aux sends to multiple outputs to generate mix-minuses for the hosts and caller, along with a more complete mix of all the parties for Wirecast itself: This type of complex routing is similar to what an audio engineer would create on a standalone hardware mixer in a live television broadcast studio. The difference here is that we're running it all in software on the broadcast machine itself. Amazing times we live in. Then, just like we sent the master video feed to the Skype machine, we also sent the mix-minus audio for the lone Skype caller back to that same machine, this time via a stereo 1/8" cable out of the Retina iMac's built-in audio port. Now the Skype caller could hear everyone except themselves. The rest of the audio mixes were fed through a pair of virtual buses straight from Logic into Wirecast, without leaving the computer, using Rogue Amoeba's clever LoopBack audio routing tool. Short story, it worked. It was crazy complex. It was expensive. Not only did this require two computers and three additional interfaces (two Magewells and a Blackmagic), it also required a Wirecast upgrade costing several hundred bucks to a "pro" feature that would allow Blackmagic video output in the first place. And after all this, the video and audio quality was still poor because, well, Skype. Needless to say, we didn't even bother with the Skype TX hardware because I didn't want to sell my car, and I still need my kidneys for future binge drinking episodes. Mimo Can You Hear Me? Enter Mimolive's "Mimocall" feature to the rescue. Mimocall is a built-in feature of the Mimolive broadcast application which automatically routes incoming video calls through Boinx's proprietary Skype-style servers, straight to your broadcast machine, over the internet. You read that correctly: built-in. I'll type that again to emphasize the absurdity of this: built-in. Here's what it looks like: The video feed from a viewer's webcam hits their Chrome browser, then Boinx's servers, and is then routed directly into your Mimolive broadcast machine as a camera source. This happens over the internet, with no additional video hardware necessary on your part for the broadcast machine. It's just there, appearing on your screen like any of your physically connected cameras. Not only that, but you can have multiple of these. Two web callers? No problem. Two more camera feeds on your screen. Arrange them however you like, including various split-screen and full-screen options. As you do this, Mimolive automatically generates the mix-minus audio monitoring feeds back to the callers, so they hear everyone except themselves. You will never need to pull up an audio mixer window for this.  It "just works", a mantra that is often repeated yet rarely delivered. In other words, Mimocall is a way to incorporate live video calling from multiple viewers, either one at a time or simultaneously, on a single broadcast machine, with the lowest-possible compute power and simplest possible interface of any solution we were able to devise on our own, for any dollar amount. And the Mimolive application itself is software we didn't even know existed until a month before our go-live date with Batio. I just stumbled across a forum discussion somewhere, and kept clicking until I got to their web site. The Boinx developers have built something with Mimocall which, to our knowledge, exists nowhere else. They are poised to take over the small broadcaster market if they can drive awareness of what Mimolive and Mimocall together can do. At the moment, Mimocall is a free service while it's still in public beta, though I suspect they will eventually figure out how to charge a few bucks for it when the feature set has stabilized. And if you teach or broadcast to the internet for a living, I suspect you'll gladly pay those few bucks, as we would, to interface with our viewers in such a simple and high-quality fashion. Disclaimer: Please note that we at Cracking the Code have no affiliation with Boinx Software other than as paying users of their product. Ready to Rock If this sounds like a lot of moving parts, we can only be thankful that the preparedness of our esteemed guest was not one of them: Despite numerous Cape Kennedy-style dress rehearsals of exactly this scenario, when the day of the broadcast arrived, YouTube's servers refused to respond. Buttons were mashed. Necks dampened. After about 20 minutes of fat-fingered fumbling in the YouTube dashboard, the live event was deleted and recreated. This effectively stranded hundreds of viewers at an old URL waiting for a broadcast which, like Godot, would never arrive. As the hopeful waited silently out there in the blackness, the broadcast light on our screen finally went red. We swiveled from our keyboards to Batio, seated behind us, shredding a furious acoustic credenza with the volume knob spun down, and asked if he was warmed up. He looked up from his fretboard, incredulous: "I'm ready to rock!" Luckily, we already were. Hit "play" on the video above to hear him say it!

By Emily Bary March 29, 2017 11:55 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple Pay could grow 40% a year for the next five years, according to one analyst, as people get more comfortable paying with their phones. Illustration: Getty Images No matter how many fancy iPhone features debut in each new model, Apple’s hardware sales can only grow so fast. The key for Apple is making the most of its users — both new and old — and getting them to pay for apps, music, and cloud storage that will enhance their iPhone experience. That part of Apple’s business is known as “Services.” The segment is poised to grow at a 15% annual clip over the next five years, faster than the estimated 5% growth for Apple’s hardware sales, according to Gene Munster, an analyst at Loup Ventures. More from Barron’s Next Here’s How Apple Shares Could Hit $200 How Long Can the iPhone Sustain Apple’s Rally? Here Comes The iPhone ‘Supercycle’ Apple has made improving its services offerings a focus, and the company says the segment on its own will be equivalent in size to a Fortune 100 company by later this year. In a report on Wednesday, Loup’s Munster walked through some of the ways Apple can grow its services unit in the years ahead. Here are some highlights: • App Store revenue should still be a big portion of the overall services total by 2022, making up 44% of sales for the segment, according to Munster. Many analysts believe that the next iPhone will make it easier for users to try augmented reality, a technology that lets people overlay virtual things on top of the real world. That could energize users and developers: “It’s worth noting that we don’t expect an acceleration of App Store growth from AR; rather, developers will view adoption of AR as fundamental to a mobile experience, and a necessity to maintain existing users and compete for new ones.” • Apple Music (and content) could grow at a 30% annual rate and its original video offerings could hold their own: “While this pursuit adds Apple to an already tight freeway of content producers and providers like Netflix and Amazon, Apple’s combination of AR and VR related hardware and content could offer some differentiation.” • iTunes revenue could decline by 10% a year. What was once the ultimate services business -- paying for individual songs, shows and movies, just isn’t so relevant anymore in the streaming era. • Apple Pay may grow at a 40% annual rate, but it still won’t account for much more than 1% of services revenue, Munster wrote. Still, he notes that Apple Pay has made some good progress in the past year, tripling its monthly user base and growing transactions by 500%: “This is clear evidence of growing user adoption of Apple Pay, as well as growing contentment with the service as a frequent and preferred payment method.” Big Picture: Apple keeps talking up its growing “Services” unit. Apple Music, Apple Pay, and augmented reality will likely be a big part of the company’s next act.

Beta testers who have signed up for Apple's beta testing program will receive the iOS 10.3.2 beta update over-the-air after installing the proper certificate on their iOS device. Those who want to be a part of Apple's beta testing program can sign up to participate through the beta testing website, which gives users access to both iOS and macOS Sierra betas. Betas are not stable and include many bugs, so they should be installed on a secondary device. Apple has said that the update fixes SiriKit car commands, which should now be working as expected. Beyond that, we don't yet know what features or improvements are coming in iOS 10.3.2, as Apple doesn't offer detailed release notes and nothing notable has been discovered in the betas we've received so far. As a minor 10.x.x update, iOS 10.3.2 likely focuses on bug fixes, performance improvements, and security enhancements rather than outward-facing features.

That’s something we’re already seeing on some Android phones, but that’s not the path Apple will take despite what we’re hearing from this new report. Touch ID on the back of the iPhone 8? Nope, nope, nope. An insider source speaking with iDrop News said this fall’s anniversary model iPhone is using a metal back instead of glass, sports vertical rear-facing cameras, uses an OLED display with curved edges, and instead of embedding fingerprint scanners in the display glass is moving the sensor to the back of the phone. Some of what the site is saying lines up with other rumors we’ve already heard, but the fingerprint scanner on the back is new—and it’s wrong. Apple won’t follow Android smartphone makers because the design isn’t elegant and certainly isn’t innovative. If Apple decided in-display sensors wouldn’t work, then the Home button with Touch ID will stay on the front. No Rear-facing Touch ID Sensor for You Moving the fingerprint scanner to the back of the phone means your phone always has to be in your hand to unlock it, and it effectively limits you to using your index finger because trying to touch the sensor with any other finger is awkward. That doesn’t sound like a design path Apple would take. It also potentially interferes with Apple Pay because your hand will sit between your phone and the payment terminal. That shouldn’t be an issue, but it’s surprising how often your iPhone has to be close enough to touch the reader before Apple Pay activates. Apple already has patents describing in-glass fingerprint scanning technology. Odds are if Apple is ditching the Home button it’s been working for some time on turning those patents into practical components we’ll see in action this fall. This is also the first we’re hearing of the rear-facing fingerprint scanner, and it’s coming from an unproven source. Apple won’t move the Touch ID sensor to the back of the phone and until it finds an elegant and reliable alternative to the Home button/Touch ID combo, the physical button is staying on the front of our phones.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Apple blocks news app about drone strikes — again By Troy Wolverton / March 29, 2017 at 9:31 AM Apple apparently thinks users of its iPhone are so sensitive that it needs to shield them from a news app. The app in question, called Metadata+, alerts users when there’s a new news report about a U.S. drone strike. It contains a simple text report and shows on a map where recent drone strikes have taken place. It doesn’t contain any graphic images of the strikes or much else. But still, Apple apparently believes that’s too much for its users’ delicate sensitivities. On Tuesday, Apple pulled the app from its store after accepting it mere hours earlier, according to Josh Begley, the data artist who created Metadata+. Apple didn’t give a reason for removing the app and it didn’t immediately respond to a request seeking comment. But the company has made its feelings clear about it in the past. Begley originally designed Metadata+, then called Drones+, back in 2012. Apple repeatedly rejected it, using a variety of excuses. It wasn’t “useful or entertaining enough.” It didn’t “appeal to a broad enough audience.” But numerous times, Apple used the same rationale — the app was “objectionable.” Apple finally accepted the app into its store in 2014, after Begley changed the name and stripped it of all content and gave it a more generic description. Once the app was in the store, he plugged back in all the historical information about drone strikes. Then, just as suddenly, Apple removed the app more than a year later, saying it contained “excessively crude or objectionable content.” Begley said he tried to re-submit the app 12 more times after that, finally and inexplicably getting it through on Tuesday only to have it removed again. Apple has tried to keep a tight grip on the apps it allows in its store. In part it’s done that to protect users from malicious software. As a result, the vast majority of smartphone malware targets Android-based devices. But the company has drawn controversy in the past for making seemingly capricious decisions about apps that aren’t malicious. It approved an app that allowed users to place a picture of themselves in a scene that made it look like they were having sex with a porn star. But it rejected a game that sought to highlight immigration issues for being “pornographic” because it included a cartoon representation of characters’ bodies going through a body scanner at a checkpoint. For his part, Begley said the bigger story is about how the country’s drone wars remain largely hidden from view. The app represented his attempt to put a light on them and to see how that might affect public discussion. That impetus seems particularly relevant given that President Trump is pressing to lift even the minimal restraints President Obama put on the drone program and strikes are already up markedly in the first months of his administration, with the number of civilian casualties rising. “If anything about the (Metadata+) app is ‘excessively objectionable or crude,’ perhaps it’s the airstrikes themselves,” Begley wrote.

There is also the issue of possible use as a recruitment tool among the jihadists. The world is larger and more complicated than just a sensitive few. Troy Wolverton The news reports are already out there. This app just alerts people to new ones (and shows on a map where drone strikes have occurred). I find it hard to believe that an app that sends alerts about news reports is going to incite more anti-U.S. sentiment or be a better recruitment tool for jihadists than the original reports — much less the attacks themselves. Regardless, we as citizens have a right — arguably a responsibility — to know what our government is doing in our name, particularly when it’s launching attacks that kill civilians in an undeclared war. Russel F. This is actually a big deal. Apple should really be busted with the same laws that prevent illegal, anti-competition behaviour – those same laws that were used to stop the telephone companies from playing the same bent games. Remember the old days? The phone companies made it policy not to allow any third-party equipment of any kind, to be connected to their networks. They *rented* you a key-telephone set at a high and recurring price, and it was “against their policy” to even allow an answering machine to be connected – much less a fax machine, or a direct-connected modem. Laws were passed (and others were just dusted-off, from the days of the Oil Trusts, circa early 1900’s), and this kind of abusive, anti-competition behaviour was prevented. Result was a whole new crop of businesses, products, and lots of innovation. Both IBM and Microsoft were busted under anti-monopoly laws, but Apple manages to just skate along as it blissfully trashes competition on its blocked, locked-in, proprietary products. I have to jump thru a bunch of hoops on my Macbook to write code that lets me put an app – for my own use only! – on my own iPad! On the iPad, I have to run Russian jail-break software, (redsn0w) just to gain root access to a computer device I paid $800 for, and which Apple has abandoned, no longer even making iOS software that runs on it! The restrictions are *nothing* to do with security, and *everything* to do with APL maintaining it’s illegal monopoly control of the hardware and software. They want to *own* the econsystem 100%. This is the econ-textbook definition of a monopoly. Apple should probably be fined $100 billion US, and told to stop this bad behaviour. They could pay the fine, because they have $250 billion US stashed off-shore, to evade US taxes (which is fair, heck, it is legal, they are allowed to do this). I don’t object to them being successful, but it does not seem necessary for them to engage in such restrictive, anti-competitive practices. At the very least, they should allow full *root* (ie. supervisor) access to their own computer devices, if a device purchaser wishes. They should pay a fine, and be forced to open up their bogus company store to any legal computer program – the one described in the article, for example – as well as any compiler, or an interpreter. I have APL running on my iPad, and I had to move heaven and earth (just about) to do it. Apple prevents – by their policy – any interpreters or programming languages – from being offered as “Apps” on their IOS devices. This is really bogus. I have a C-compiler running on my iPad. That took some doing, also. And bottom line is – this cool technology, which might actually make me some money – is absolutely blocked by the bastards at Apple from even being offered in their stupid iStore. ( I have a very primitive neural network, written in APL, running on the iPad. ) But there is *zero* go-to-market options for me with this technology and Apple’s iStore rules. I am happy to see game and toystuff developers make money. But it is being done at the expense of what these small tablet devices could actually be. Apple keeps them as locked-down, controlled toys – because it can make gigadollars off of this kid’s market. Brilliant business strategy – but it holds back the world now, because their monopoly behaviour is choking off all other opportunity channels. Break the bastards up, I say. Hit ’em with the same big hammer that was used on Standard Oil Trust early in the 1900’s, and on IBM and ATT in the 1970s, and Microsoft in the 1990’s. At least make them provide *root* access to anyone who wants to install their own software on the computing machine that the customer has purchased. Feel free to disagree. But let me say, the iPad, even the old first-gen device, makes a damn fine little computer, once you hack it open, and put APL and C and various real stuff on it. It’s BSD/Unix (basically Linux) under the hood. It can run SSH and SCP and you can log into it from a Windows or Linux box, and fling files back an forth easily – no Apple iOS bullsh*t stopping you. It will try to stop you from running any native-built C-code, (a “security” feature of iOS), but there are ways around that too. Once the machine is opened up to the world, it is a great little computer, despite being slow and memory-limited. See http: // www. gemesyscanadacom for the details on how to jailbreak the thing, if interested. I don’t dislike Apple (they make nice hardware), but their business practices should be altered, I feel. It’s maybe time now.

(AAPL) Stock Still Requires Caution 4 Retail REITs That Must Face the Music View All Posts Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ought to release a reality TV show called “Everyone Loves Apple Stock.” When you have the support of Warren Buffet of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) fame, you’re doing really well. And let’s be honest — AAPL stock is a freak of nature. Anyone who doubts this company and its dazzling rate of climb are eventually proven wrong. Source: Shutterstock It’s also a dangerous position to take if you’re thin-skinned. Similar to the Russian government deploying troll propagandists — and no, this was well before Donald Trump — Apple stock is buoyed by ardent fans. Impugn the honor of AAPL, and you will be on the receiving end of a stern, albeit grammatically incorrect, lecture. Write anything less than positive about the company and you risk the outrage of the Apple Stasi. Listen, I love AAPL stock just like the next guy. For my on-the-go digitalization needs, I exclusively use Apple products. More importantly, the company knows how to organically integrate their multiple businesses under a cohesive umbrella. This is an area that companies like Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE:SNE) have attempted with mixed results. So I completely get the bullish argument of Apple stock. But just how high can AAPL go? Is Apple Stock the Next Trillion Dollar Investment? InvestorPlace contributor Chris Lau laid out a comprehensive thesis for why Apple stock could hit $189. At that price, assuming no other fundamental changes, AAPL stock would have a market capitalization of $1 trillion. Or, as the President might say, Apple could assume 5% of the U.S. national debt. As Lau states, the target is well within the realm of possibility. First, enthusiasm is sky-high for the company’s 10th anniversary iPhone release. Just for the historical milestone, the new iPhone should perform remarkably. Also, the Samsung Electronic (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) fiasco with its imploding devices is a boost for Apple stock. Call it the schadenfreude effect, if you will. Wall Street analysts are certainly willing to play ball. Many have raised their price targets for AAPL stock to within a more reasonable range to $1 trillion. This sentiment is aided by the fact that the Chinese smartphone market is in flux. Its local competitors have duked it out for top position. But given the aforementioned iPhone milestone, it’s conceivable that Apple can once again be competitive in China. This sets up a lucrative long trade for Apple stock. After all, to hit the trillion mark, AAPL will need to gain another 36%. That’s serious growth, so long as the horizontal axis known as time is short enough. Competition Is Much Harder for AAPL I don’t doubt that Apple stock will hit $189, and eventually breach the $200-mark. I’d say that’s a no-brainer assumption. So far this decade, AAPL stock is averaging remarkable annual returns of 23%. And year-to-date, shares are up more than 20%, and we’ve got plenty of 2017 left! This is literally the data of inevitability. But one thing that concerns me is the ebb and flow cycle of Apple stock. Shares tend to get ahead of themselves, only to crash back down to earth. It’s a pretty volatile ride, and that may or may not be everyone’s cup of tea. Furthermore, while this decade has been great, it pales in comparison to the 2000s, when AAPL averaged 53.5% returns. Different era, different trade, I get it, but still — don’t expect shares to hit a trillion all at once.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Taiwan News Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Taiwan News Thu, Mar 30, 2017 - Page 3　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Taiwan Taxi riders can use Apple Pay for fares, firm says By Shelley Shan  /  Staff reporter A passenger in Taipei yesterday taps an Apple Pay instruction in a cab belonging to the Taiwan Taxi fleet, the largest cab company in the nation. Photo: Cheng Ping-hung, Taipei Times Taiwan Taxi customers can now use Apple Pay to pay their fares, the nation’s largest taxi company said yesterday. The company already allows their passengers to pay taxi fares using EasyCards, credit cards, allPay, Alipay and a host of other online payment platforms. “Taiwan Taxi Co offers the best quality transport service, and Apple Pay provides the best online payment platform. With this partnership, we are ushering in a new era of digital payment in transportation. It will also help us create value-added services,” Taiwan Taxi Co general manager Joanna Lee (李瓊淑) said. The credit card numbers consumers enter into the Apple Pay system would not be saved to their mobile devices, nor would they be stored on Apple servers, the company said. However, users would be able to pay cab fares via Apple Pay and still accumulate points on their credit cards, he said. In related news, downloads of Taiwan Taxi’s ride-hailing app have increased since Uber suspended its services in Taiwan last month, making it the most used taxi app in Taiwan, a survey by the Market Intelligence and Consulting Institute showed. The application developed by Taiwan Mobile was also among the five most popular travel apps in the nation, the report said. It is possible that former Uber users switched to similar apps created by competing operators, driving a spike in use of competitors’ apps, the institute said, adding that further research was necessary to confirm this.

Getty Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Apple’s latest operating system upgrade, iOS 10.3, has arrived. Here’s what you should know before selecting “Install.” First, the good news: the upgrade comes with a long list of perks.  If you lose your AirPods (Apple’s wireless earbuds), you can now track them down using Apple’s “Find My Phone” feature. They’ll make a sound wherever they are.  The new iOS also expands on Siri’s capabilities to sync with other apps. That means you can now command Apple’s personal assistant to carry out more commands for many of your payment, ride booking, and automaker apps, according to Apple.  Another convenient addition: in iOS 10.3, Maps now shows you the weather forecast in the city you’re heading towards, so you don’t need to toggle between Maps and Weather.  One unexpected benefit of this upgrade? It actually appears to free up additional storage space on your phone. Apple Insider reports that new file storage technology means data can be saved more efficiently; in their test, a top-of-the-line 256 GB iPhone 7 Plus gained an extra 7.81 GB of available storage space by switching to iOS 10.3. It will probably make your phone processing feel a little faster, too. Apple engineer Renaud Lienhart explained how the team accomplished that on Twitter: iOS 10.3 feels “snappier” because many animations were slightly tweaked & shortened, for the better.— Renaud Lienhart (@NotoriousBUGS) March 28, 2017 With the latest upgrade, Apple is also leaping forward in its goal to bar 32-bit apps, which are thinly supported by app-makers, from running on its operating system. The new iOS 10.3 includes a new way to identify which of your apps are 32-bit and see if there are updates available: just open Settings, select General, select About, and then select Applications to see the list. Apple is expected to phase out 32-bit apps entirely at some point down the road.  So what’s the verdict on whether to upgrade? Technology writers are chiming in: “iOS 10.3 is one of the most impressive updates Apple has released in some time,” technology reporter Gordon Kelly wrote at Forbes. “Switching the entire file system of around one billion compatible devices is a huge task and all signs are it has gone smoothly, while also saving users space and improving performance.” All in all, the subtle tweaks of iOS 10.3 “may be worth the upgrade,” wrote CNET’s Vanessa Hand Oreilana.  The new upgrade builds on iOS 10, which debuted in September along with Apple’s iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The operating system included whimsical new messaging features, from stickers to the ability to write directly on your screen, as well as better app integration for Siri, an overhaul for Maps, and a new “Wake Up” feature that activates your phone simply when you lift it up.  As with all operating system upgrades, be mindful of potential bugs. There are some isolated reports of glitches on Apple’s Communities Forum. As with most upgrades, the risks are higher with Apple’s older products.  One important note: Make sure to backup your precious data and media before you make the switch. With this upgrade, Apple is switching over to a new filing system, and some users have reported losing files stored on their phones in the process.  And as always, remember to connect to Wi-Fi before you start downloading iOS 10.3 to save on data usage. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Given the choice between a new iPhone with the same design plus new features like wireless charging and facial recognition or a new iPhone with a new design and no new features, I’d absolutely choose the new design. Sony A6500 Luckily at least one new iPhone model this year is expected to include both whiz-bang features and a radical new design according to rumors and reports, but the lack of case design leaks so far made me think about the possibility of only getting new features in an iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus with the same design. This may only apply to customers as close to the day-to-day Apple news as I am (although I suspect it applies more broadly), but the iPhone 7 design sticking so close to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s design has put an even greater emphasis on needing a big leap forward this year to keep the excitement. We’re still expecting new iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus phones with updated specs this year, but that’s likely only because the real flagship is expected to come at a premium cost and be supply constrained. Focusing so much on how the iPhone looks versus how it works doesn’t make logical sense when you can argue that new features make it more capable, but I really think how it looks is something a lot of people care about. That’s especially true when the feature set of the iPhone aside from design is as advanced as it is right now. Samsung has already been doing things with the display that make the iPhone look stale, although they tend to botch overall design with other distasteful elements (not the mention the Note 7 combustion incident). I still wouldn’t consider switching from an iPhone to a Samsung phone, but the new Samsung Galaxy S8 introduced today shows how much progress Apple can make this year with the iPhone design. Using iOS versus Android is the biggest reason for me to stick with the iPhone. The whole ecosystem (including Apple Watch for me) is very sticky and I’m overall happy with the experience. But I have to admit that the front of the Samsung Galaxy S8 makes me envious as an iPhone user (even if the backs of iPhones all look way better than the backs of Samsung phones). Display comparison via WSJ It’s not just about how it looks. Samsung and other Android smartphone makers have been making better large screen phones than Apple for a while now. Larger phones are harder to use with one hand. That’s why Apple stuck to smaller phones for a while, then added Reachability as a software trick on larger phones. Shrinking the bezel (especially the chin and forehead) on the iPhone will go a long way in terms of making larger iPhones easier to use, and that’s what we’re expecting to see this year if the rumors pan out. My biggest point of dissatisfaction is choosing between a smaller iPhone that’s easier to handle for me or a larger one with better features like Portrait mode. The rumors point to a 5.8-inch display in a body with similar dimensions to the 4.7-inch iPhone 7. Assuming Apple manages to pack all the flagship features like Portrait mode and wider landscape support into the new model, that should be a compelling device based on design advances alone before you consider the bells and whistles.

By Larry Dignan for Between the Lines | March 29, 2017 -- 16:13 GMT (09:13 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Samsung mobile chief DJ Koh rolled out the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus with curved edges and a bezel-free design. Toss in some virtual desktop tools, services, and artificial intelligence, and Samsung may have a hit on its hands. samsung galaxy S8 Our hands-on first impressions Galaxy S8 escapes the sea of sameness Bixby voice agent brings the fight to Alexa and Siri Samsung's latest smartphone and accessories, in pictures DeX dock: Can it make the virtual desktop a core technology? Video: See IP68 water resistance in action Why I'm not buying the Galaxy S8 this year [CNET] But Koh's launch of the Galaxy S8, which is supposed to provide a new start in what has been a "challenging year for Samsung" and a ticket out of hell from the Galaxy Note 7 debacle, had a big elephant in the room. That elephant: Apple's upcoming 10th anniversary iPhone. Apple's next iPhone is expected to kick off a "super cycle," according to Wall Street analysts. Should those analysts be correct, Samsung is at a pivotal moment. Samsung has to move on from the Galaxy Note 7 battery issues. Samsung must offer a design with the Galaxy S8 that captivates tech buyers and spurs an upgrade cycle. CNET: Samsung Galaxy S8: Everything just announced at Samsung Unpacked | Galaxy S8 is the ticket out of Note 7 'hell' | TechRepublic: Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus: The smart person's guide In other words, Samsung needs a bit of perfection. And, if the upgrade cycle for the Galaxy S8 develops slowly -- entirely possible --Samsung will be months away from Apple's September-October launch. Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White sums up Samsung's hurdles: "Although we believe Samsung will unveil some cool new devices today, we believe Apple has Samsung on the ropes like never before in recent memory," said White in a research note. "With Apple operating on all cylinders and a strong iPhone launch expected this fall, combined with the rise of more China-based competitors, we believe the pressure is on Samsung to deliver a strong upgrade without any missteps. We believe if Samsung stumbles again, the company's position in the smartphone market could be permanently impaired." Samsung's latest smartphone and accessories,... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 24 NEXT PREV Justin Denison, head of product strategy for Samsung US, cited a commitment to innovation, quality, and safety. Those attributes were a common theme throughout the S8 launch. Biometrics, facial and iris recognition, and other tools were interesting additions to the Galaxy S8 line. To be sure, the Galaxy S8 with its camera improvements, hidden home button below its screen and DeX dock could be enticing. However, White noted that potential buyers of the S8 line may wait for the new iPhone to be unveiled. Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri said in a research note that new iPhone builds for the 10th anniversary edition of the device "forms a powder keg for this launch." Arcuri estimated that new iPhone builds will total about 110 million to 120 million in calendar 2017. Of that total, 55 million to 60 million will be the 5.8-inch version of the iPhone. Like the Galaxy S8, Apple is expected to go bezel-free with the Touch ID button integrated into the display. Arcuri estimates that Apple will ship 87.5 million iPhones for the quarter ending Dec. 31, up from 78.3 million for the previous year. That shipment tally, juiced by the 10th anniversary iPhone, would set records. Korea Investment and Security analyst Jay Yoo is projecting that Samsung will ship 42 million units of the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus in 2017. In other words, Samsung's Galaxy S8 will be strong, but it will face its doubters over the Galaxy Note 7 issues. Bottom line: Samsung's biggest challenge may be dueling with expectations relative to an Apple iPhone launch that's months away.

Kevin DrumMar. 29, 2017 12:16 PM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Mohammed Mohammed/Xinhua via ZUMA Over at the Intercept, Josh Begley has a story that's disturbing—but not in the usual Intercept way: Five years ago, I made a simple iPhone app. It would send you a push notification every time a U.S. drone strike was reported in the news. Apple rejected the app three times, calling it “excessively objectionable or crude content.” ....In 2014, after five rejections, Apple accepted the app....But the following September, Apple decided to delete the app entirely. They claimed that the content, once again, was “excessively objectionable or crude.”...Well, Apple’s position has evolved. Today, after 12 attempts, the Metadata app is back in the App Store. ....Update: 2:32pm. Apple has removed Metadata from the App Store. There is, needless to say, nothing objectionable or crude about this app. It merely aggregates news on a particular subject. Drone strikes themselves may be objectionable and crude—opinions differ, obviously—but reporting on them isn't. This matters. Upwards of half of all Americans get some or most of their news from their mobile devices, and for all practical purposes there are only two options in the mobile device world: iOS and Android. If you can't get an app accepted on either platform, then no one will ever see your app. Apple and Google are the sole gateways to what we can and can't see. Now, there are obviously other ways of getting the news. There may even be a website that aggregates drone news the same way Begley's app does. Still, there's no question that an app can do things a news site can't. It can make the news more immediate. It can make sure you don't miss anything. It can allow you to share more easily with fellow activists. When Google and Apple are just keeping out porn sites, no one really cares. Even when they're nixing apps that happen to compete with Apple or Google, people mostly shrug. But when they start censoring apps based on their news content, we're in trouble. If there were dozens of mobile platforms, and none of them had a big market share, it might not matter too much. Competition would probably sort things out. But when there are only two, it matters a lot. There may still be plenty of news outlets, but in a real-world sense we're increasingly outsourcing our news to a tiny number of players—mostly Apple, Google, and Facebook.

clock menu more-arrow After the smoke clears: inside Samsung's quest for redemption The Galaxy S8 is Samsung’s most ambitious project yet by Dan Seifert@dcseifert Mar 29, 2017, 12:31pm EDT Illustrations by James Bareham Photography by Amelia Holowaty Krales and Vjeran Pavic share tweet Linkedin “We have a dream to overcome Apple.” With that simple, obvious statement, the air was sucked out of the large conference room in Samsung’s Suwon, South Korea, headquarters before the company even had a chance to show me the device I flew halfway across the world to see. It’s not often that you hear someone at Samsung actually verbalize the unsaid motivation for many of the company’s products — most executives won’t even mention Apple by name. Yet here was the company’s vice president of product strategy just blurting it out to a small group of journalists. The dream he is referring to specifically is the Galaxy S8, which after three years of development was officially announced today. Dream happened to be the codename of this project, as Samsung’s president of mobile communications, DJ Koh, elaborated on later: “All of the mingling and aggregation [of work we did on previous phones] comes true with the S8 and S8 Plus. That's the reason we put the name as like a Dream, rather than thinking of other competitors or other phone manufacturers.” Samsung’s longest dream has been to step out from the shadow of the iPhone For the past few years, Samsung’s actual dream has been to step out from the shadow of its most well-known competitor, to no longer be just the foil to Apple and the iPhone, but a company defined by its own terms. And in many measurable ways, Samsung has already accomplished that. It’s the largest phone maker in the world, and it moves millions more units than Apple does each year. It often pioneers technologies in its devices long before they show up in the iPhone. It has the ability to source virtually all of the major components for a smartphone from a subsidiary. But by the metric of public perception, the Galaxy S line of smartphones have always played second fiddle to the iPhone, always seen as a response, not the original. Inaccurate or not, beating that perception has been a goal — even a dream — for Samsung. Of course, life within Samsung’s walls for the past half a year has been closer to a nightmare. Photo: Samsung If you’ve never seen a phone battery explode in person, it’s an arresting experience. First, the battery swells and expands well beyond its normal size. Then the swollen battery starts glowing a hot red, before finally bursting into flames. The whole process happens in about 30 seconds, leaving you barely enough time to react. What’s left afterward is a charred piece of stinking metal and plastic and probably some damaged property, or worse, injured people. That exact scenario played out dozens of times last fall, when Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 had to be recalled not once, but twice, in one of the most embarrassing episodes in tech history. The Note 7 situation sucked the wind out of Samsung’s remarkably successful year, and turned Samsung into the butt of countless exploding phone jokes. "That was a very painful experience and painful accident,” DJ Koh says with remorse. “During the investigation of the root cause of the Note 7 [incident], I learned there was an opportunity for us to increase the safety of our devices and batteries.” Koh, who had his hands deep in Samsung’s mobile business long before he was appointed president last year, was disappointed by the company’s failures. “We set up our own standard, but we didn't keep our standard,” he admits. Samsung president of mobile communications, DJ Koh. Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge The first time I saw a battery explode was in a controlled environment: Samsung was giving me a tour of its battery-testing facilities in Gumi, South Korea, in the wake of the recalls. As part of its expanded testing parameters, the company checks long-term usage simulations, including the various ways a battery can be damaged and cause an explosion. One particular machine puts pressure on a battery cell with a large piston; if you happen to put nearly twice the amount of pressure of Samsung’s accepted safety threshold, the battery will combust inside the machine’s chamber. For the sake of demonstration, Samsung’s engineer did just that. The battery didn’t explode at first; in fact, it appeared that the battery was just fine and the tour guide moved on. But about a minute later, the cell started swelling and glowing bright red, before bursting into flames and settling as a charred scrap of electronics. Had this not been a demonstration, Samsung would have rejected the entire batch that this battery came from and sent them all back to the supplier. That was a common refrain I heard when touring Samsung’s battery-testing facilities: if one battery fails a single test, it means as many as 15,000 would be rejected and sent back. To ensure that the Note 7 situation never happens again, and to make sure the Galaxy S8 rights the course for Samsung’s phone division, the company has greatly expanded its battery-testing processes. It has outlined an eight-point battery-inspection checklist, which includes both new and expanded testing. Not content letting its suppliers do the majority of testing, Samsung now duplicates tests within its own facilities, acting as another backstop to detect and identify any failures before they end up in customers’ hands. Samsung can test tens of thousands of devices at a time in each of its factories Photo: Samsung There are rows of testing stations in the Gumi factory where the company can test discharge the batteries in up to 60,000 phones at once. These testing stations are replicated in the company’s factories across the world, including China and Vietnam. Ironically, the tests are recorded using recalled Note 7s, suspended in selfie sticks above the rows of discharging phones. Presumably, these phones are safe to use. Samsung has also created a new “Accelerated Usage Test,” which is designed to replicate normal usage patterns over time. The AUT covers charging, discharging, water exposure, and typical things people do with their phones, like connecting to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks, placing calls, and using social media apps. The company employs dozens of people to run through these tests over and over again on 100,000 devices to ensure there are no problems. It doesn’t appear to be a very enjoyable job. Samsung demonstrated all of these tests to me in an effort to prove that the company is taking battery safety far more seriously than it had in the past. Before Samsung can make its dream of stepping out of Apple’s shadow true, it first needs to prove to would-be customers that the Note 7 fiasco won’t happen again. It’s doing that by communicating — and over-communicating — its testing procedures at every opportunity. “My main focus was how can we deliver meaningful innovation to the consumer to make their life happy and enjoyable, but the most important thing I missed the was product safety,” says Koh. “Meaningful innovation will keep going, but on top of it will be a priority of product safety.” “Meaningful innovation” is what Samsung hopes will lift it out of the mire of both the Note 7 fiasco and out from the shadow of Cupertino. The company has long been a pioneer in hardware innovation and that certainly continues with the S8. But this time around, there’s as much of an emphasis on software and services as there is on the hardware itself, and Samsung knows that if it’s going to succeed at all, it can’t just make devices that run other companies’ software and platforms. The company has long struggled to balance including compelling software features that people actually want to use and adding value to its own hardware offerings. There’s an entire graveyard of failed Samsung services and software, including the ill-conceived Milk Music and Milk Video and countless gimmicky camera and interface features. For anybody who tried Samsung's ridiculous "smart scroll" features that tried to automatically pan content around based on tilting your phone or your eye movements, your level of trust in trying the latest Samsung "feature" is very low. But in recent years, the company has had success with services such as Samsung Pay and Samsung Knox, both of which provide utility and good customer experiences. The S8 comes with those, of course, but it’s adding a number of new services to its stable in order to stand out from the crowd. Bixby is the most ambitious software Samsung has ever produced The most ambitious of these is Samsung’s spin on a virtual assistant, dubbed Bixby. It’s the company’s entry into the super hot virtual assistant world, which has been dominated by Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, and yes, Apple. But while many of the virtual assistants we’ve seen thus far have been based on providing different ways to perform web searches, Samsung’s approach is notably different. Samsung’s Bixby assistant on the S8. “The persona for Bixby that we’re pursuing is a bright sidekick, a much more friendly agent to users,” says Dr. Injong Rhee, Samsung’s head of research and development for software and services. “Bixby is capable of developing a new interface to our devices, or devices that are going to host Bixby. Our perspective is to make the interface of the phone simpler and more natural to use.” It's a smart play: Samsung knows it can’t compete with Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others when it comes to raw machine learning power and putting vast amounts of information at your fingertips, so it’s using Bixby to solve a simpler task, one that those companies have largely ignored. Bixby isn't going to try to be the everything-assistant. Instead, it will be that "bright sidekick" that complements those other services. It's a new user interface, not a new way to ask how tall the Eiffel Tower is. Rhee seems like the right person to head up Samsung’s nascent artificial intelligence arm, and he’s had success developing the Knox security platform within Samsung already. A charismatic and intelligent speaker, Rhee is a big thinker, the kind of future-planning executive that looks far beyond the current product being sold and focuses on things that can change the direction of a company as a whole. Samsung’s head of research and development for software and services, Dr. Injong Rhee. Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge As a result, Rhee sees Bixby as something much bigger than just the phone. Bixby is not designed to be a place where you find the answers to any question; it’s meant to be an actual assistant that helps you use the device that's right in front of you, whatever that device may be. “Since Bixby will be implemented in the cloud, as long as a device has an internet connection and simple circuitry to receive voice inputs, it will be able to connect with Bixby,” explained Rhee in a recent blog post announcing the feature. “The hardware capability that's required to have Bixby is very small.” That means virtually any of the devices produced by Samsung’s vast conglomeration of businesses, from TVs to washing machines to refrigerators and microwaves could eventually get Bixby integration. It’s a platform play on a scale that Samsung has never attempted before, joining various disparate parts of the company’s business under one theme. If Samsung wants to succeed as a service provider, it needs to get its software in front of as many people as possible Even more telling, Rhee doesn’t see Bixby limited to Samsung’s own products. “Having it on other devices, even competitors, is something we have to think about because that's the future we're heading towards,” he says when asked if Bixby would ever be available for Apple’s devices. That’s a very different approach from a solipsistic company that’s long acted like its devices were the only ones in the universe. But it follows a recent pattern, echoing the moves Samsung has made to make its wearables and accessories compatible with non-Samsung Android devices and even the iPhone. It appears that Samsung is learning that if it wants to succeed as a platform and services provider, it needs to get its software products in front of as many people as it possibly can, even if they don’t buy a Samsung phone. Of course, the company isn’t nearly there yet, and Bixby is making its debut in a very limited way on the S8 and S8 Plus. At launch, it works with just a handful of Samsung’s native applications, supports two languages (English and Korean), and relies on a dedicated button on the side of the phone. In the gallery app, it will let you do things like send an image to a contact without having to switch apps or type in any of their information, while inside the camera app it will identify objects and send you to Amazon to buy them. Rhee says the eventual goal for Bixby on the phone is to be able to perform every task that you can do with touch via voice. According to his tally, that means it will be able to do tens of thousands of actions and understand the millions of ways that someone might ask for help when using their phone. That’s hugely ambitious, and Samsung will have to contend with managing expectations when people buy an S8 and find that Bixby doesn’t do particularly much at first. It will have to find ways to get people to keep trying Bixby as it gets updated with more capabilities, or when it fails to do what they ask it to. That’s a struggle that all virtual assistants have to overcome — even Apple’s Siri is familiar with this problem, which has had low repeat usage rates for years. But if Samsung is able to make good on its ambitions with Bixby, it could be the most important thing to come out of the Galaxy S8’s development. “Customers aren’t excited by new phones anymore,” says Daniel Kang, the head of product planning for the Galaxy S8. Too many phones look the same and don’t do anything different from the multitude of other phones on the market. That’s a hairy situation for a company like Samsung to be in. Like Apple, it makes most of its profits from the sales of phones. So for the S8, Samsung doubled down on its hardware features that do separate it from the crowd. Put plainly, that means curved screens. “When we introduced the S6 Edge, we felt [the curved screen] would become Samsung's identity,” says DJ Koh. "But we didn't utilize the edge properly.” The S8’s hardware is conservative and predictable, but still stunning It wasn’t until last year’s Galaxy S7 Edge that the real advantage of having a curved screen on a smartphone became clear: it allows for a bigger screen in a smaller, narrower, easier-to-handle frame. The S7 Edge was the narrowest 5.5-inch smartphone on the market last year and notably smaller than Apple’s 5.5-inch iPhone Plus. “Eighty-nine percent of smartphone users want a narrow bezel with a larger screen,” explains Kang. “People want bigger screens, but they don’t want bigger phones.” As a result, Samsung has completely left flat screens behind, and both the Galaxy S8 and the larger S8 Plus feature the company’s signature curved screen design. Combined with the new 18.5:9 aspect ratio “Infinity Edge” display, which pushes the screen out to the corners of the phone’s frame farther than ever before, Samsung is able to fit a 5.8-inch display in a footprint barely bigger than the iPhone 7 and its significantly smaller 4.7-inch screen. The net effect is stunning: the S8 looks like a device from a science fiction movie. The incredibly small borders above and below the screen and curved sides make it feel like you’re just holding a screen and nothing else. It’s perhaps the most logical extension of the smartphone design since the first iPhone was introduced. But anyone paying attention to Samsung’s hardware designs for the past couple of years could have predicted that the company would go this route. As stunning and polished as the S8 is, it is basically an S7 Edge with the screen pushed out to the corners. That’s not a bad thing, per se, but it’s much more evolutionary than revolutionary. People might not be excited by new phone hardware anymore, but that hasn't stopped Samsung from making the most exciting and beautiful phone designs I've seen in years. The S8 is loaded with other Samsung specialties, too, including fast wireless charging, high levels of water resistance, and not one, but three different ways to unlock the phone without having to punch in a PIN code. It has the latest and greatest processor from Qualcomm or Samsung itself, and a front-facing camera that now can autofocus. As usual for a flagship Samsung phone, it checks of all the boxes you could ask for on a spec sheet. Yet it’s hard to shake the feeling that Samsung is being conservative with the S8’s hardware. Its design is a progression; the hardware features aren’t new, but refined. Perhaps that’s the smart approach for a company reeling from the Note 7, which pushed the boundaries in hardware design and features and literally blew up in its face. Most crucially, Samsung is conservative with the S8’s battery. The batteries in both versions of the new phone are smaller than what was in last year’s S7 Edge, but Samsung says it is using a new chemistry that provides a longer lifespan over time, so your battery life won't degrade as much over a year or two of use. But even if Samsung is being conservative with the S8’s hardware, the device is unmistakably a Samsung phone and doesn’t look like anything from Apple. After years of making phones that were always seen as followers to what Apple did, Samsung has made a device that stands apart from the iPhone, in both looks and intent. As I watched brand-new S8 phones get bolted together on Samsung’s new production line in the Gumi factory, it was obvious that the company has a plan for designing great hardware in the wake of the Note 7 fiasco. But as much as I knew that the devices coming off that factory line would have amazing hardware and eye-catching design, I couldn’t escape a nagging thought. First look at the Galaxy S8 Samsung has made the nicest phone hardware ever. I realized that there’s a thing that many pro users do when they get their hands on a new Samsung smartphone: they immediately disable as many of Samsung’s own apps and services as possible and replace them with Google’s versions. The appreciation for Samsung’s design and hardware rarely extends to its software efforts. That’s the biggest challenge Samsung faces in its quest to come out from the shadow of Apple. It can’t rely on its hardware manufacturing prowess forever, it needs to develop software and services that make use of that hardware and provide utility for its users. It needs to make things people want to use, not just things that look good. Samsung needs to make things people want to use, not just things that look good The S8 is the company’s most ambitious attempt yet to do that. Bixby is limited right now, but embedded in it is a vision that ties Samsung's various hardware manufacturing divisions together with software services. It certainly won’t stop anyone from using Google’s services today, but Samsung hopes that buyers will at least try Bixby instead of Google Assistant the next time they want to use a voice assistant. Samsung even dedicated an entire button on the side of the phone to activate Bixby, in case it wasn’t clear how serious it was about it. “I don’t want to boast, this is a starting point,” says Koh. “We are on the line of a marathon, the Galaxy S8 will be the first product to enable all of Samsung’s products to be connected. It is the most meaningful device in my career.” In this Storystream Galaxy S8 announcement: all of the news from Samsung’s launch event Samsung Galaxy S8 preorders are now live After the smoke clears: inside Samsung's quest for redemption The Gear VR’s new, leaner home screen has fancy avatars and a VR web browser View all 26 stories Circuit Breaker This is the Samsung Galaxy S8, coming April 21st Tech Samsung Galaxy S8 event: start time, live blog, and where to stream Policy & Law The 265 members of Congress who sold you out to ISPs, and how much it cost to buy them Loading comments...

 One Samsung exec described the Galaxy S8 as the 'dream to overcome Apple' Kif Leswing Mar. 29, 2017, 12:22 PM 5,647 facebook linkedin twitter email print Business Insider Samsung takes its rivalry with Apple seriously. They are the two biggest smartphone makers by market share.  Samsung's competition with Apple is prominent enough that one exec told Mashable's Pete Pachal that its latest phone, the Galaxy S8, had a codename that was in fact a reference to Apple. Pachal writes:  The Galaxy S8, codenamed "Dream," was three years in the making — about a year longer than most product development cycles, Samsung's Gaeyoun (Robert) Kim, vice president of global product planning for mobile, said in an interview at Digital City. ... The Dream may have double meaning, at least to Kim. In an unguarded moment, he said the Galaxy S8 was conceived as the "Dream to overcome Apple" — a bold admission from a company that's been repeatedly accused of lifting features from its rival in Cupertino, California.  However, the company tried to walk back that statement, especially given the long-running patent lawsuits between the two companies, as well as the the public impression that Samsung copies Apple's features: Samsung reps later backpedalled Kim's comments, saying it was simply his own retroactive interpretation of the codename, and not an internal mandate, so make of that what you will. It's hard to mistake Samsung's latest for an Apple iPhone. The Galaxy S8 has lots of features that the iPhone 7 doesn't, including slim bezels, an iris scanner, and a dock that lets you access your phone's contents using a traditional PC setup (monitor, keyboard, and mouse). It also doesn't have a dual-lens camera, one of the big features Apple introduced last year on the iPhone 7 Plus. "In low-light conditions, [the iPhone 7 Plus dual camera] just uses the digital zoom, so what's the value of it?" Kim told Mashable.  Mashable's feature on the Galaxy S8 is a fascinating look into a critical moment for Samsung, and is worth reading in full.  SEE ALSO: Hands-on with Samsung's latest flagship smartphones, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ More: Apple Samsung Galaxy S8 facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru One Samsung exec described the Galaxy S8 as the 'dream to overcome Apple' One Samsung exec described the Galaxy S8 as the 'dream to overcome Apple' Samsung takes its rivalry with Apple seriously....

While the device looks pretty slick on the surface, many people have argued that Apple should have made the front of the device black, as opposed to white. We’ve already shared one concept image that imagines a (RED) iPhone with a black front, but now YouTuber Danny Winget has taken it a step further and actually transformed the device… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Winget posted a video today highlighting the process of turning the (RED) iPhone 7 into the red + black color combination. The process is rather extensive, but nevertheless it is possible. He explains in his video that it’s much more difficult than just swapping out the white front display with a black one. If you do this, you’ll either have a black front with a white Home button, or a black Home button but no Touch ID. This is because the Touch ID sensor is connected to the iPhone’s logic board as a security precaution and thus can’t be switched between devices. In order to get a completely black front with working Touch ID, Winget essentially had to transplant one iPhone into another. He took the logic board and front panel from a Jet Black iPhone 7 and moved it to the PRODUCT(RED) iPhone 7, thus giving him a red back and completely black front. Winget says the process was relatively difficult and time intensive, not to mention expensive. You also lose the water resistant seal around the display in the process. This is how you can put a black display on the new PRODUCT RED iPhone 7 or 7 plus with full functional Touch ID. You have to do some surgery to make that work but you can see it here. Nevertheless, the end result is a pretty sharp looking red iPhone with a black front. There are, however, some easier ways to get to this point. For instance, you can pick up a black skin on Amazon for relatively cheap, but you’d be stuck with a white home button. What do you think of this red and black iPhone 7 design? Is this what Apple should have included in the first place? Watch the video below and let us know down in the comments.

How different could the iPhone 8 be? Coming attractions: Samsung to beat Apple once again Video Review: How do the BeatsX compare to the AirPods? Samsung just took the wraps off its new Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones in a bid to make people forget about last year’s exploding Note 7 disaster. While the Galaxy S8 has a few things working against it—namely that it runs Android—Samsung gave its new flagship an impressively slick redesign. We wouldn’t mind if Apple lifted a few of the S8’s features for its 10th anniversary iPhone. In fact, Apple is reportedly working on a few of these features already. We’re not saying that Samsung looks at Apple product rumors to define its own roadmap, but…anything’s possible. Here are five Galaxy S8 features we’d like to see in the next iPhone: Bye, bezels Adam Patrick Murray, IDG Worldwide Look at that edge-to-edge display. Samsung’s basically bezel-less “infinity display” on the Galaxy S8 is bananas, to put it mildly. The new phone has an 83 percent screen-to-body ratio, which means this thing is basically all display—a Super AMOLED display, at that. Apple is reportedly working on an edge-to-edge display of its own, which is a good thing. At this point, the iPhone’s thick bezel and LCD screen feel a bit dated, although the iPhone 7 LCD display’s quality has been rated as comparable to its competitors’ OLED versions. But we would love if the iPhone 8 featured an expansive screen with hair’s-width side bezels and a super slim “forehead” and “chin.” Samsung has also gone all-in with curved OLED screens, which Apple is also reportedly considering, though it’s unclear if the company has found high-quality suppliers that can produce enough curved OLED panels for all those iPhones. Home button, be gone Michael Simon Samsung put the Galaxy S8's fingerprint sensor on the back, which we hope Apple doesn't do. With its vast screen, Samsung banished the phone’s physical home button. The S8’s home button is now beneath the display, so you can press the screen and the button will respond with haptic feedback (though our Greenbot colleagues report that the S8’s vibrations are nothing like the iPhone’s). Samsung kept its flagship’s fingerprint sensor, but moved it to the back—right next to the camera lens. This is a bad move, and one we hope Apple doesn’t follow. Rumor has it Apple is planning to embed Touch ID right into the iPhone’s display, which makes much more sense than sticking it on the back. Use your face to unlock your phone The Galaxy S8 turns your face into the password you use to unlock your phone, with an iris scanner to recognize your “eyeprint” instead of a fingerprint. The S8 also uses biometric facial recognition, so you hold your phone in front of your face and the S8 will immediately slide into your home screen. Given that Samsung put its fingerprint sensor in such an awkward spot, this is a necessary design decision. But it’s also an insanely cool advance for smartphone technology, and something we hope Apple is exploring for the iPhone. A useful voice assistant Last year, Samsung acquired Viv, an AI-powered voice assistant created by the founders of Siri. Viv become the foundation of Bixby, the voice-activated assistant baked into the Galaxy S8. Bixby is contextually aware with the ability to answer follow-up questions. This is something Siri can’t do. At all. If you’re looking at a map on your screen, Bixby knows what it is and what you mean when you say, “Bixby, capture this.” Siri doesn’t know what you’re looking at on your screen, and saying, “Siri, capture this,” would likely take you to a list of Bing search results for “this.” To be fair, the early word on Bixby is that it's incredibly limited and not as cool as it sounds, though Samsung didn't let anyone try it out before unveiling the S8. Apple is slowly improving its assistant’s capabilities, but its glacial pace of progress is due to privacy concerns. Apple doesn’t want Siri to store information about you or what you’re doing on your phone. Anyone who cares about protecting their data appreciates Apple’s premium on privacy, but there must be some middle ground that would make Siri smarter. Augmented reality comes to the camera Michael Simon Samsung redesigned the Galaxy S8 camera to include augmented reality. Samsung also introduced a new feature called Bixby Vision, which lets you use your camera to scan items. Bixby Vision will then overlay details about the item, such as a book, and give you a link to buy it. Apple is reportedly working on augmented reality, too—CEO Tim Cook has hinted as much in a series of comments over the last year. And rumor has it Apple is still considering the best AR applications for the iPhone camera, though it’s unclear whether the company’s ideal use cases are product scanning and shopping. (Our guess is no.) Samsung still has to prove that Galaxy S8's new safety-checked battery won’t set the phone on fire, which is a pretty low bar to clear. But the S8’s new features are ones we hope Apple is already working to perfect for the iPhone 8, which we expect to launch this September.

For the first time on a Samsung phone, the physical home button is removed entirely. (This is already the case on most other Android devices.) The S8 will be the first phone to feature Bixby, Samsung’s new AI assistant. Despite a crowded voice assistant market, Samsung insists Bixby is “fundamentally” different from competitors like Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa. It remains to be seen how this will play out. Samsung touts the assistant as being able to “see, remind and recommend,” but much of this functionality is already available with rival assistants. One potentially interesting feature is the ability to observe behavior patterns and add in reminders. For instance, if you usually call your mom at a specific time each day, Bixby will ask you, unprompted, if you’d like to call her at that time. Samsung plans to make Bixby available on all of its appliances, from air conditioners to TVs. There is a designated Bixby button on the side of the S8, which is unlike its rivals. Like previous models, the S8 can be submerged for 30 minutes in up to 5 feet of water. People can also use facial recognition to unlock the phone, which Samsung has offered in the past. The Galaxy Note 7’s iris scanner allows you to open the phone with your eyes and the new phones will offer this tech as well. Samsung planned to release pricing later Wednesday. Preorders start on Thursday and the phone will begin shipping April 21. The S8 will initially be available in midnight black, orchid gray and arctic silver in the U.S. The South Korean tech giant has a lot to prove following the global recall of its exploding Galaxy Note 7s. At a media event on Monday, executives acknowledged that last fall was a “challenging time” for Samsung, but said the company has learned a lot and remains focused on innovation and quality. Problems with the Note 7s arose shortly after the launch last August, with several complaints of devices catching fire when charging. Some replacement phones also caught on fire. Samsung initially blamed faulty batteries, but some experts believe a design flaw may have been the cause. The recall wiped out billions of dollars of profits and hurt Samsung’s brand. “The launch of the new device must be perfectly executed for Samsung to gain innovation leadership and to gain market share in the high-end smartphone segment,” said Thomas Husson, vice president and principal analyst at research and advisory firm Forrester. Samsung’s Galaxy S8 will also be going up against the newest version of the iPhone, which is due out later this year. Expectations are high for the new phone, likely called the iPhone 8, partially because this year is the 10th anniversary of the device. “Samsung only has a window of opportunity of several months before the launch of the 10th anniversary iPhone,” Husson said. “The launch of Samsung’s new flagship smartphone is thus key for the brand even though it has managed to reduce its business dependency on smartphones, contrary to Apple.” Despite the Note 7 debacle, Samsung reported a profit of 9.2 trillion won ($7.9 billion) for its most recent quarter, an increase of 50 percent from the year prior and its highest level in three years.

Today’s Top Headlines » Luxembourg To Support Ireland In Apple Case » New Zealand Seeks Input On Automatic Tax Information Exchange » Quebec Announces Income Tax Reforms » Report Warns Of Emerging Irish Motor Tax Shortfall » Slovenia Urged To Lower Labor Tax Burden Luxembourg To Support Ireland In Apple Case by Ulrika Lomas, Tax-News.com, Brussels 29 March 2017 Luxembourg is expected to be one of a number of member states to support Ireland in its appeal against the European Commission's ruling in the Apple state aid case. Luxembourg is planning to make a third-party intervention in support of Ireland when the appeal is heard by the General Court of the European, a spokesman for the Luxembourg Finance Ministry has confirmed to the Irish Times. It is understood that other member states may also submit interventions in an attempt to strengthen Ireland's case. In August, the Commission concluded that two tax rulings issued by Ireland to Apple have substantially and artificially lowered the tax paid by Apple in Ireland since 1991. It ordered Ireland to recover, under EU state aid rules, "unpaid taxes" from Apple for the years 2003-2014 of up to EUR13bn (USD14.1bn), plus interest. The Irish Government has since asked the EU General Court to annul the Commission's decision. Apple has also launched an appeal against the ruling, and it is thought likely that the two cases will be joined together by the court. As part of the EC's wider probe into member states' private tax rulings, Luxembourg has been ordered to recover state aid from Fiat Finance under the state aid rules. The Commission has also alleged that Luxembourg granted selective tax advantages to Amazon and McDonald's, and is undertaking an in-depth investigation into tax rulings issued by the Duchy to Engie (formerly known as GDF Suez).

Monday, March 20, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] Building a Hackintosh Pro Dan Counsell (tweet, Hacker News): If Apple made a mini tower that was upgradable and could take a full sized graphics card (or two), I’d have purchased it in a heartbeat. However, they don’t. There’s no doubt that Apple has a refresh for the desktop market in the works, I just don’t know if it’s going to be enough to satisfy the creative market who seem to be slowly migrating to Windows. […] Building a Hackintosh is not for everybody. It’s not a simple process, there is an overwhelming number of parts to choose from, and on top of this you need to pick the ones that are compatible. When you’ve built the machine you need to get macOS running on it, it’s not a quick process. If you want to do it, do your research and take your time. I’d probably say this build took me around 8 hours from unboxing the components to getting macOS installed. I’ve been running this machine for a couple of weeks now and I couldn’t be happier. It’s super fast and I can easily switch between Mac and Windows. I’ve switched off auto-updates in Sierra. While system updates should work just fine, I prefer to hold off until the community over at tonymacx86 have confirmed there are no issues. This is probably one of the major drawbacks to running a Hackintosh. Michael Rockwell: The performance this machine was able to achieve, at the price he paid, is staggering. On single-core tasks, it’s faster than any Mac Apple currently sells and, if you forgo all the bells and whistles, it can be built for about $1,800. Previously: Video Pros Moving From Mac to Windows for High-End GPUs, Building My $1,200 Hackintosh. Update (2017-03-20): See also: Stephen Hackett, Kirk McElhearn. Update (2017-03-22): Dave Mark: Have your heart set on a speedy new Mac Pro? Given that nothing appears to be on the horizon from Apple, your best bet is to build your own Hackintosh. […] I’d also make your way through both of the Dan case studies above just to get a sense of the process and, most importantly, to understand the caveats that come with building a Hackintosh. Hackintosh Mac Mac Pro macOS 10.12 Sierra 6 Comments 6 Comments Keir Thomas March 20, 2017 5:31 PM Since upgrading to a retina MacBook Pro a few years ago, I really don't think I could use daily a computer without retina. My eyes start to water if I can see the antialiasing take place. This is a powerful remind that the "Mac experience" is about more than specifications. I'd hate to use a non-Apple keyboard and mouse with a Mac too. Again, it wouldn't be the Mac experience. Chucky March 20, 2017 5:57 PM "Since upgrading to a retina MacBook Pro a few years ago..." But the point of a Hackintosh is not to replace your laptop. It's to build a desktop Pro machine for doing Pro work on a regular basis. "I really don't think I could use daily a computer without retina. My eyes start to water if I can see the antialiasing take place." Unless I'm missing something, this one is just weird. The Hackintoshes being discussed all involve 4K graphics cards... "I'd hate to use a non-Apple keyboard and mouse with a Mac too." This one baffles me as well. ----- I'm not in the market for a Hackintosh because I'm not doing Pro level work on a regular basis. But if I were, the option seems quite compelling. You can live with delayed OS updates in a Pro work machine, for various reasons that should be obvious. cremes March 20, 2017 6:19 PM I built a really nice PC and loaded up Ubuntu 16.10 on it. I now run OS X under QEMU/KVM and it rocks. I followed these instructions: https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM Took me a few days to figure out bridged networking in QEMU. I contributed some docs on that topic to the above project. I run OS X in a window on my main desktop but with some more effort I could pass the video card through (via PCI pass through) and get HW accelerated video and all of the goodies. But I don't play games or use anything that requires video acceleration so I'm content with running it in a window. Marc Edwards March 20, 2017 6:37 PM @Keir Thomas What makes you think you can’t have a Retina display, and use an Apple keyboard and mouse? This is only talking about swapping out the main box for something else. And as for displays, you can’t have an Apple external display these days anyway. Who knows if or when they’ll decide to stop making mice and keyboards. remmah March 25, 2017 2:44 AM I had a Hackintosh during the Ivy Bridge days... gave me fewer problems than my current 2010 Mac Pro. I shied away from Hackintoshing after it started requiring utilities that needed to be downloaded from SourceForge. But it seems like SourceForge offers HTTPS downloads finally, so I'm keeping an eye on the Hackintosh scene once again. Jon H March 26, 2017 12:58 AM @Marc Edwards: "What makes you think you can’t have a Retina display" You can even get a Matte Retina Display, which Apple apparently isn't interested in providing.

Thursday, March 23, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] Apple Acquires Workflow Matthew Panzarino (tweet, MacRumors, Hacker News): Apple has finalized a deal to acquire Workflow today — a tool that lets you hook together apps and functions within apps in strings of commands to automate tasks. […] Workflow the app is being acquired, along with the team of Weinstein, Conrad Kramer, Ayaka Nonaka and Nick Frey. In a somewhat uncommon move for Apple, the app will continue to be made available on the App Store and will be made free later today. […] Apple confirmed the deal, and has said the following about Workflow: “The Workflow app was selected for an Apple Design Award in 2015 because of its outstanding use of iOS accessibility features, in particular an outstanding implementation for VoiceOver with clearly labeled items, thoughtful hints, and drag/drop announcements, making the app usable and quickly accessible to those who are blind or low-vision.” It sounds like Apple was more keen on the accessibility than the automation. Federico Viticci (tweet): Workflow doesn’t need an introduction on this website. I’ve been covering the app since its debut in 2014, and have been following every update until the last major version, which brought the fantastic addition of Magic Variables. You can catch up on over two years of Workflow reporting and tutorials here, and access even more advanced workflows in our dedicated section on the Club MacStories newsletter. At this stage, it’s not clear what Apple’s plans for Workflow in the long term might be. I have a few theories, but this isn’t the time to speculate. I’ll say this, though: Workflow has been the driving force behind my decision to embrace the iPad as my primary computer. Workflow is a shining example of the power of automation combined with user creativity and its underlying mission has always been clear: to allow anyone to improve how iOS can get things done for them in a better, faster, more flexible way. Workflow is the modern bicycle for the mind. There’s nothing else like it. John Gruber: This certainly provides ammunition against the argument that Apple no longer cares about power users. For me this is Apple’s most intriguing and exciting acquisition in years. […] Doing things the iOS way via Workflow looks cool, but whenever it comes down to it, it always feels easier to me to just wait until I’m at a Mac and create it there. The other way of looking at this is that perhaps it’s a sign that (a) Apple’s internal efforts are not as far along as we’d hope, and (b) that their plans for automation are more like Automator than supporting a language with inter-process communication. They may want to replace AppleScript on the Mac with something more limited, which would be unfortunate. Stephen Hackett: I have a million questions, many hopes and quite a few fears about this. Michael: The small, abused optimist in my brain hopes this will turn out as successful as Siri or TestFlight, but the pragmatist is afraid my most productive app on iOS is dead. David Sparks: There was another innovative application on the iPhone years ago that Apple purchased called Siri. Once they bought it, the pace of innovation slowed down and while it’s great that the Siri got incorporated into the operating system, there’s a lot of us that still miss the old version that had some crazy new innovative feature with each update. I think there’s a legitimate concern that Apple will do the same with Workflow. […] If, however, Apple absorbs Workflow into the operating system with the intention of bringing real power user tools to iPhone and iPad users, I believe they could go even further than the current third-party version of Workflow. Imagine if Apple created APIs that allowed any app to tap into Workflow’s automation tools. Imagine if we could string together automation steps that allow users to press one button and have five different applications lend a hand to getting work done. Khoi Vinh: Unlike many Apple acquisitions, this one was not just a deal for the Workflow team but for the app itself too, which signals that Apple sees value in the product. […] It now seems apparent that Apple intends to make iOS itself more open to Workflow-style automation, not less, and that’s a good thing. The kind of customization that Workflow allows is critical for the iPad, particularly, if it’s to become a true productivity platform. […] When you look at competitors like Amazon’s Alexa platform, Google Assistant, Cortana, etc., they all lack a truly elegant, easy-to-master entryway for casual users who want to customize their experiences—and that’s exactly what Workflow gives Apple. (Though don’t be surprised if these other players acquire Zapier or IFTTT soon as well.) Guy English: This is terrific! Congratulations all! We interviewed the Workflow cats a while ago. You can listen to it here. Gabe Weatherhead: That doesn’t sound like a company that’s [aggressively] pursuing automation on iOS. [Accessibility] is still a wonderful, and arguably much more important, goal for Apple, but I don’t think it’s a positive move for the people that love the app. Unlike [Panzarino], I think this is bad news for anyone that relies on Workflow to make iOS useful. If all your eggs are in that one basket then you better hurry up and build a new basket. I’d love to be wrong on this front, but I don’t think automation is a priority for Apple or for iOS. The URL support isn’t just languishing on iOS, Apple has actively killed access to some [features] in launcher apps. Nick Lockwood: I see Apple’s acquisition of Workflow as further reinforcement of their message that 3rd party extensions of the platform are not welcome. Most devs who try to build tools to expand the capabilities of iOS get shut down. The ones that don’t get acquired so Apple can control them. Dr. Drang: The big question: to incorporate it or to kill it? Jason Snell: I’m going to be positive and say that this is Apple acknowledging that this sort of functionality should be core to iOS, and that Workflow (or a successor) could be vastly more powerful if it’s given more power and control than any third-party app ever could. You could, in fact, argue that Workflow is the iOS app that Apple should’ve built itself, but didn’t. Matt Birchler: Can you imagine what Workflow could do if it had full access to the OS? I have high hopes for this move 🤞 Ole Zorn: I hope the @WorkflowHQ acquisition leads to better automation infrastructure on iOS, and not just one privileged app, controlled by Apple. Michael Rockwell: I’m not worried about @WorkflowHQ going away, but I am worried about some of their actions that integrate with third-parties disappearing. Rui Carmo: Update: and the first post-acquisition update is already out, axing support for Pocket and Google Maps (two of the things I used with it), among others. One can only hope that Apple has better plans for it than subsuming it and watering it down – at least they’re making it free, but I would very much like to see it evolve into something even more powerful under Apple stewardship, rather than languishing into obscurity… Trevor Kay: Lol didn’t take Apple long. Ryan Burnett: “Workflow Gallery submissions are no longer supported” 🙁 Marco Arment: Don’t blame Workflow or Apple for removing Google, etc. actions in last night’s Workflow update. It was lawyers, not strategy. A few weeks ago, Workflow asked all supported apps to sign a simple 1-page contract confirming permission to call our URL schemes. People sue Apple over ANYTHING, ALL THE TIME, so it makes sense for their lawyers to be overly cautious like this in an acquisition. Steve Mops: You still can provide honest release notes when you remove functionality. Previously: Thank You, Sal. Update (2017-03-24): See also: Accidental Tech Podcast. Update (2017-03-28): Josh Centers: One big question about an automation scheme based on app extensions and a Workflow front end is just how powerful it could be. Could it compare to what can be achieved with Automator and AppleScript on the Mac, or would it be closer to Workflow’s current limits? Accessibility Apple AppleScript Business Google Maps iOS iOS 10 iOS App Legal Pocket Siri Workflow App 3 Comments 3 Comments Keir Thomas March 23, 2017 2:38 PM It's a bit muddy and I'm not sure I entirely understand it either but my vision of the future for users is this: At the moment on our desktop computers we make work processes out of windows, and files. This arose historically, of course. In the glorious iOS future, we'll make processes out of apps and tasks, and I think Workflow indicates this, although it might be considered very primitive in hindsight. Apps and tasks. Two sides of the same coin for the user. It all relies on the right kind and quality of apps and tasks being available, of course, and that indicates the primacy not only of good software but of companies like Apple who have the creativity mixed in there too. Creating the right kind of tasks requires empathy and true understanding. It really is Apple's future for the taking. Leo M March 23, 2017 4:57 PM I'll be guardedly optimistic. I use Workflow up & down for much the same thing I use Automator for: one-off workflows to do this n that. Maybe Apple will take some of the ideas from Workflow and put them in Automator and vice versa? It would have been nice if Apple had retained Sal to shepherd the Workflow kids if that, in fact is what they want to do. Automator (and Workflow) are great tools for norms who don't want to get into explicit scripting & just want to use "Duplo" or visual blocks. I don't get the "Accessibilty" thing. Apple is already quite good at Accessibility. I'm guessing there will be a plugin SDK and 3rd party vendors who want Workflow integration will be coding it themseives. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ has March 23, 2017 7:35 PM Left my comments over on the Ars article. Basically, I went through a period about a decade ago of thinking "visual programming" like MIT's Scratch was the answer to making coding accessible and easy to non-programmers. Then I started creating my own end-user languages, read Papert, and figured out that since the written word has been successfully building civilizations for the last 10,000 years, it wasn't the choice of medium but the particular delivery that was the real problem. And since it's trivial to map a homoiconic text-based language to visual form representations, it makes far more sense to start with text (which is also your serialization format for file storage and exchange) and build up from there, rather than start with GUI blocks which can build neither up nor down. See also essential vs accidental complexity. The only other thing I'd say is that URL munging stinks worse'n Satan's own arsehole.

The facility could be linked to Apple’s autonomous car project. At least 10 doctoral and postdoctoral students from ETH Zurich University have left the school for the research facility, the report said. “The specialists from the laboratories for computer vision and robotics are particularly in demand,” Inside IT reported. “Most of them are from the area of ​​visual navigation research.” A professor of autonomous systems at ETH Zurich, Roland Siegwart, said five of his specialists left for “big international corporations,” citing Google and Apple as examples. However, he could not confirm whether Apple’s facility in Switzerland exists. Project Titan, which has not been formally announced by Apple, has had various setbacks. Last October, Apple reduced its efforts in the project, leading to hundreds of employees losing their jobs. Among those who were laid off were 120 software engineers working on a car OS, as well as hardware engineers. The layoffs reportedly started in August, and by October it wasn’t clear how many employees were still working on the project. Even project leader, Steve Zadesky, left the venture early last year. It was reported that Apple recruited Chris Porritt, former Tesla vice president of vehicle engineering, to head Project Titan after Zadesky’s departure. Project Titan had an initial 2019 target date for the self-driving car, but then pushed it back to 2021, according to The Information .

The 20-year-old taken into custody is believed to be a member of the Turkish Crime Family, an upstart collection of hackers who claimed to be in possession of hundreds of millions of Apple and iCloud usernames and passwords and have threatened to wipe the accounts unless Apple pays a ransom. Read: Hackers Blackmailing Apple Over Supposed Stolen Credentials Confirmation of the arrest came just hours after an email from the Turkish Crime Family was sent to the press, including International Business Times, claiming one of the group’s members had been arrested. According to the account from the Turkish Crime Family, the man arrested had his door broken down by “a large quantity of federal agent officers” at 10 a.m. local time Tuesday morning. He has not been online since, and the group believes some of his servers and possessions may have been seized. The Turkish Crime Family provided IBT with a video, which was supposedly filmed by a friend of the arrested hacker who was present during the law enforcement raid, and photos of a search warrant dated March 27, 2017. According to the warrant, the arrested man was suspected of having committed blackmail under Section 21 of the Theft Act 1968, and unauthorized access with intent to commit or facilitate commission of further offences under Section 2 of the Computer Misuse Act 1990 The warrant authorized law enforcement to search for any broadband router, computer hardware—including laptop, desktop, smartphone, or tablet—and digital storage device believed to belong to the supposed hacker. Read: How To Change Your iCloud Password According to Motherboard, NCA would not confirm whether the name on the warrant matched that of the person the agency arrested, but the date, postcode, suspect’s age and alleged crimes of the warrant line up with what the agency would confirm. The Turkish Crime Family has insisted it remains undeterred by the arrest. “Apple can carry on with raiding the innocent people however just know that this will not stop the attack,” the group said.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

The South Korean giant's mobile chief DJ Koh told a New York event the Galaxy S8 and S8+ handsets marked "a new era of smartphone design." The two handsets, fitted with screens of 5.8 and 6.2 inches, include Samsung's upgraded digital assistant Bixby, competing in a crowded field that includes Apple's Siri, Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. Koh said Bixby would provide users with "more and more personalized help," using voice commands to navigate apps and services. As the top-line handsets for the world's biggest smartphone vendor, the Galaxy S8 models will challenge the latest Apple iPhones. Their release comes after Samsung was forced to recall its Note 7 phones for catching fire due to overheating batteries. The debacle cost the South Korean company billions of dollars in lost profit and hammered its global reputation and credibility, during a torrid period when it has also been embroiled in a corruption scandal. The company apologized to consumers for the recall and was forced to postpone the S8 launch. Its investigation blamed the problems on faulty batteries. Samsung later embarked on a campaign to restore its battered reputation, placing full-page advertisements in US newspapers, admitting it "fell short" on its promises. The tech giant says it has also come up with elaborate step-by-step safety verification procedures for future products to prevent similar disasters.

The latest version of macOS Sierra brings a handful of cool upgrades, but none as exciting as ‘Night Shift,’ the long-awaited app we first fell in love with on iOS. Here’s how Apple describes the new feature: Night Shift adjusts the color of your display after sunset. Many studies show that exposure to bright-blue light in the evening can affect your circadian rhythms and make it harder to fall asleep. After sunset, Night Shift will shift your display colors to the warmer end of the spectrum, making the display easier on your eyes. In the morning, your display returns to its regular settings. “This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us. FIND OUT WHY If you’re a past F.lux user — or current Windows user — this may all sound familiar to you. 10.12.4 is the first version of macOS Sierra, however, to bring it to Mac users without third-party apps. Aside from Night Shift, 10.12.4 also brings updates to Siri, Dictation, and PDFKit APIs.

By: Reuters | Updated: March 29, 2017 9:17 pm The S8 features Samsung’s new artificial intelligence service, Bixby, with functions including a voice-commanded assistant system similar to Apple’s Siri. ( Source: AP) Samsung Electronics Co Ltd unveiled its Galaxy S8 flagship smartphone as it battles to regain the market leadership it lost to Apple Inc after the embarrassing withdrawal of the fire-prone Note 7s. Boasting some of the largest wrap-around screens ever made, the long-awaited S8 is the South Korean tech giant’s first new premium phone since the Note 7 debacle in October, which wiped out $5.48 billion of profit and helped Apple overtake Samsung as the world’s top smartphone maker in the fourth quarter. Two versions of the Galaxy S8, code-named Dream internally, were launched at a media event in New York on Wednesday, with 6.2-inch (15.75 cm) and 5.8-inch curved screens – the largest to date for Samsung’s premium smartphones. The phones, which will go on sale on April 21, are slightly longer but comparable in width to their predecessors as Samsung has eliminated nearly all of the bezel borders around the face to maximize the screen surface area. The S8 features Samsung’s new artificial intelligence service, Bixby, with functions including a voice-commanded assistant system similar to Apple’s Siri. There is also a new facial recognition application that lets users unlock their phones by looking at them. Samsung is hoping the design update and the new features – nothing revolutionary but focused on making life easier for consumers – will be enough to revive sales in a year Apple is expected to introduce major changes to its iPhones for their 10th anniversary, including the very curved screens that have become staples of the Galaxy brand. The S8 is also crucial for Samsung’s image as a maker of reliable mobile devices. The self-combusting Galaxy Note 7s had to be scrapped in October just two months after their launch and a failed attempt to recall the Note 7s in September was particularly damaging, investors and analysts say, leading to questions about the firm’s credibility. Samsung responded by implementing new battery safety measures after an internal investigation identified battery problems from two different suppliers as the cause of the Note 7’s problems. Still, some analysts say consumers may be wary of potential safety problems with the S8. “Initial sales of the S8 may appear slow compared to what was typical for previous model releases,” said Lux Research analyst Christopher Robinson. “In other words, smaller initial sales spike.” Samsung’s early marketing of the S8 has eschewed the safety issue, which brand experts say is an attempt to avoid reminding consumers of the images of burnt Note 7s that spread throughout the world’s media late last year.

Oilers team By the time the Oilers start the post-season, they will have played 868 regular-season games between playoff appearances. To put that in perspective, former Oilers goaltender Grant Fuhr played 867 career regular-season games. And in the first 868 regular-season games in Oilers history, the team won four Stanley Cups and were en route to winning their fifth. IN PHOTOS: Edmonton Oilers 1984 Stanley Cup reunion None of the players from the 2005/06 Oilers roster are still with the team. In fact, Ales Hemsky and Matt Greene are the only two players from that team still playing in the NHL today. “Me and Greener (Matt Greene) always talk about it too,” Former Oiler Jarett Stoll, who played on the team at the time, said while in Edmonton Tuesday. “We look back and we are like, ‘if we just would have won that one game.’ We still think about that loss.” Carolina Hurricanes Ray Whitney, left, hugs Edmonton Oilers Ryan Smyth after game seven of the NHL Stanley Cup finals in Raleigh, N.C., Monday June 19, 2006.

CP PHOTO/Paul Chiasson WATCH: Jarret Stoll says he still thinks about 2006 Game 7 loss to Hurricanes  When it comes to the current team, it’s evenly split between players who have played in an NHL post-season game and players who haven’t. Oilers veteran Jordan Eberle, who played his 500th NHL game on Saturday, has never seen the playoffs. Until now. The head coach at the time, Craig MacTavish, was canned by the team in 2009 after missing the playoffs for the third straight year. But he wasn’t gone long, as he was hired back by the Oilers in 2012 and is currently the Oilers vice president of Hockey Operations. After MacTavish was fired as head coach, the team went through five head coaches before landing on current head coach Todd McLellan. The ownership of the team has also changed hands since 2006. Daryl Katz bought the team from the Edmonton Investors Group in 2008. Red light cameras If you sped through a red light in 2006 you likely didn’t get a ticket unless you were caught by a police officer. That’s because Edmonton police didn’t start using red light cameras at Edmonton intersections until November 2009. Rocket visits Pluto In the time between Oilers’ playoff visits, a rocket made its way 7.5 billion kilometres from Earth to Pluto. NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on Jan. 19, 2006. The spacecraft flew by the dwarf planet in the summer of 2015. READ MORE: In Photos: Images of Pluto reveal complex world YouTube YouTube was in its infancy the last time the Oilers made the post-season. Founded in February 2005, YouTube was bought by Google in November 2006 for US$1.65 billion. Now, YouTube has launched local versions in more than 88 countries and has over one billion users – almost one-third of all the people on the Internet. Technology How many times have you heard or said the words, “there’s an app for that?” Probably a lot, but definitely not in 2006 because apps didn’t start appearing until 2008. You also didn’t watch a Global News broadcast in HD in 2006. Global News didn’t go HD until 2010, the first Edmonton news station to make the move. Hollywood Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes were one of the hottest couples of the time and on Nov. 18, 2006 tied the knot at Odescalchi Castle in Bracciano, Italy. The couple’s marriage didn’t last as long as the Oilers’ playoff drought, though, as Holmes filed for divorce in 2012. Crash won the Oscar for best picture in 2006, beating out Brokeback Mountain, Capote, Good Night and Good Luck and Munich. Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest was the highest-grossing film of the year. Daniel Powter’s Bad Day was the top song of 2006, according to Billboard. Hannah Montana, starring a then 13-year-old Miley Cyrus, also premiered in March 2006. Politics Alberta has gone through six premiers since the last time the Oilers were in the playoffs. During the ’06 Cup run, the late Ralph Klein was premier. Since then, the province’s top spot has been held by Ed Stelmach, Alison Redford, Dave Hancock, Jim Prentice and now Rachel Notley. 🙌🙌🙌Yesss! Way to go #Oilers!! #LAKvsEDM #StanleyCup https://t.co/qMhy1id6LO — Rachel Notley (@RachelNotley) March 29, 2017 Things have been a bit more stable locally and nationally. Stephen Mandel was mayor in 2006 and Stephen Harper was Prime Minister, taking over from Paul Martin. Rogers Place Then there is, of course, the Oilers new home: Rogers Place. The idea of a new barn for the Oilers was first brought to light in early 2008, when a report was released suggesting downtown would be a good location for a new arena. Several years of contentious debate and negotiations followed until the final plan was approved in May 2013. Construction began in March 2014 and the new facility opened its doors in September 2016. READ MORE: A look back at the debate over Rogers Place Oilers Octane In the last 11 years, the Oilers Octane – the first cheerleading team for a Canadian NHL team – have come and gone. The team debuted in December 2010, but their efforts were short-lived, lasting just six seasons. READ MORE: Edmonton Oilers cut Octane cheer team What hasn’t changed? While it was a frustrating decade at time for fans through the rebuild, perhaps the only thing that hasn’t changed over the past 11 years is the passion Oilers fans have for their team. That, and gas prices. While it’s fluctuated over the years, the price of a litre of gas in 2006 was about 94 cents, similar to the current gas price in Edmonton. What did we miss?

I bought the very first Macintosh back in 1984. My current mobile technology line-up is a 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, 11-inch MacBook Air (now just a backup Mac), 9.7-inch iPad Pro and an iPhone SE. I’m all-in on Apple, and the ecosystem is a large part of that. Things may not always Just Work, but the Apple ecosystem gets closer to that than anyone else. However, while I do make some use of iCloud, I’m not all-in on Apple’s cloud storage. In this piece, I compare the main cloud services out there, and finally describe the mix-and-match approach I use to get what I consider to be the best of all worlds … Anker braided Lightning cables There are, of course, an almost infinite number of players out there. Some of the smaller services have their benefits and their fans, but I’m focusing here on the major players for one crucial reason: you don’t want to entrust your data to a company that may be here today, gone tomorrow. Cloud storage is one area where I only trust the big boys because they aren’t going to disappear overnight. You could argue that Google Drive might be an exception. The company is notorious for launching services with much fanfare and then quietly shuttering them some way down the line. But Google isn’t going to risk its reputation by closing a core service, and one for which migrating services would be a major hassle. Another reason to stick to major services is we can be confident in their fallback plans. Smaller services may have super-robust backup regimes, but I wouldn’t rely on this. The big companies have extensive mirroring systems. That doesn’t mean any of them are infallible. You should never depend on any cloud service as your sole backup. But the big four will be a safer bet than a smaller company. I’m also excluding Amazon Drive, because it forces you to use its own top-level directory structure (Documents, Pictures, Videos) rather than allowing you to mirror or choose your own, and because its Mac and iOS apps suck. Let’s start with Apple’s own offering, iCloud. iCloud Monthly pricing 5GB: Free 50GB: $0.99 200GB: $2.99 1TB: $9.99 2TB: $19.99 No annual plans available. Pros iCloud is the obvious solution to anyone who exclusively uses Apple kit. In principle, it meets the Just Works criteria: activate it on all your devices, and you get easy access to all your data – from calendar, notes and photos through to iWork documents. Your iOS devices also get automatically backed-up to iCloud at the flick of a virtual switch. It requires no setup, no effort. You also a bigger range of storage tier options than other services, from 50GB at the lower end to 2TB at the top end. Cons If you need the 1TB option, which is the most likely tier for those making substantial use of cloud storage, iCloud is a little more expensive than most competitors given that Apple offers no discounted annual subscription. iCloud seems to suffer more outages than competing services, and can be glitchy. At the trivial end of the scale, it can take several minutes for a new file or edit on one device to show up on others; at the more serious end, it can cause chaos if you have more than one Mac with different sized drives. Finally, iCloud is clunky to use from non-Apple devices. Dropbox In my view, the service against which all others must be compared. Monthly pricing 2GB: Free 1TB: $9.99 2TB: $12.50 Unlimited: $20/user on business plans Discounts available for annual subscriptions. Pros For me, the crucial benefit of Dropbox is speed and reliability. I’ve tried all the main services over the years, and Dropbox has always been 100% reliable and has consistently synced within seconds. That’s a killer feature right there, in my view. It’s also really easy to use – just create a Dropbox folder and drag-and-drop things into it. If you want your entire Mac online, just put all your document folders inside your Dropbox folder, and they will then be available locally and in the cloud. Dropbox also provides a really easy way to share both files and folders with people: simply copy them into your public folder and right-click to get a link you can share via email or IM. Cons There are no storage tiers between the free 2GB and the $9.99/month 1TB level – though you can earn extra storage through referrals. There are no real-time collaboration tools. Google Drive A no-brainer place to store your iPhone photo backups. Monthly pricing 15GB: Free, plus unlimited free storage for up to 16MP photos 100GB: $1.99 1TB: $9.99 10TB: $99.99 Discounts available for annual subscriptions. Pros Google Drive gives you a generous 15GB free, and it also adds unlimited free storage for your Google Docs, Sheets and Slides files – and supports real-time collaboration on these. It also offers a maximum storage tier of a massive 10TB – though at a much stiffer price than Dropbox’s $20/user/month for unlimited storage. But the killer feature of Google Drive is that you get completely free storage of photos up to 16MP. That means that you can store absolutely all of your iPhone and iPad photos in full resolution completely free of charge! Use the Google Photos app to automatically backup photos to Google Drive and you don’t even have to think about it. You also get unlimited free storage of videos, but only at 1080p, not 4K. Cons The main drawback of Google Drive – and the reason I rejected it as my own primary cloud storage service – is that uploads are slow. It doesn’t matter how fast your broadband connection, files just drag themselves onto the drive reluctantly. Single files are no problem, but as soon as you find yourself uploading a whole folder of larger files, be prepared to wait a while. Microsoft OneDrive As you’d expect, this is primarily aimed at Windows and Office users. Monthly pricing 5GB: Free 50GB: $1.99 1TB: $6.99 Top tier comes with a free Office 365 subscription, and you can earn extra storage through referrals Pros If you’re an Office user who likes to have ongoing access to the latest versions, OneDrive is a bargain – offering a free Office 365 subscription for less than competing services charge for their 1TB tier without freebies. It also offers real-time collaboration on Office documents. Cons Office is only licensed for a single Mac, iPad and iPhone, so you’re out of luck if you use more than one of any of these. Also, although your OneDrive documents are available to multiple devices, if you accidentally delete one, you can only retrieve it from the device on which you deleted it – so not ideal for those who work from one device at home and another while mobile. Neither Mac nor iOS apps are great. Really, this is a service designed for Windows users – and it feels like it. My mix-and-match approach I have a 50GB iCloud account, and use iCloud for my core services. My calendar and notes are on iCloud, and I greatly value having (mostly) seamless access to these between devices. I use Messages and FaceTime as my primary chat and audio/video call apps. I also use iCloud as the primary backup for my iPhone and iPad, though I also do occasional encrypted backups to iTunes, especially before upgrading devices. I use Google Photos to automatically backup my photos. I have the Google Photos app running on all my devices – iPhone, iPad and Mac – and find it fantastic to have unlimited storage free of charge. To me, this is an absolute n0-brainer. But my primary cloud storage service is a 1TB Dropbox account. On my Mac, my Dropbox sits at the top-level in my account folder, and everything else is stored in sub-folders within this. This means that all of my documents and media are available to me on any device, including on the web. I’ve used it for several years now, and as I said earlier, have found it 100% reliable and super-fast to sync. Finally, I’m a huge believer in belt-and-braces. When I’m working on something important, like a novel, I copy it to multiple places. It already sits on Dropbox automatically, but I also make manual copies to iCloud and to my (free) Google Drive account. What about you? Do share your own approach to cloud services in the comments.

While Apple’s developer guide has long discouraged app makers from making such a blatant move, the company is now outright rejecting apps that make any mention of their price in the name or within screenshots. Submitting an app with “free” in its title now returns the following error message: “Your app’s name, icons, screenshots, or previews to be displayed on the App Store include references to your app’s price, which is not considered a part of these metadata items. Please remove any references to your app’s price from your app’s name, including any references to your app being free or discounted. If you would like to advertise changes to your app’s price, it would be appropriate to include this information in the app description.” Existing apps with “free” in their names are still available on the App Store and seem unaffected, but it’s possible that future updates will be rejected if the name isn’t changed to move into compliance with the new policy. Apple confirmed the change but offered no further comment.

With watchOS 3.2, Apple’s SiriKit framework that debuted alongside iOS 10 is now available to watchOS developers. With SiriKit, developers can now implement Siri commands in Apple Watch apps for messaging, payments, ride-booking, workouts, calling and searching photos. This should be great for feature parity: it’s confusing being able to message people via Viber on iPhone, but not with Viber for Apple Watch. TUTORIAL: How to listen to music via your Apple Watch without iPhone As for Theater Mode, toggling it in Control Center puts your watch into silent mode while keeping the screen dark until you tap it or press the Digital Crown or the Side button. Theater Mode is great when you’d like to prevent notifications from disturbing others whilst ensuring that you’re still getting haptic feedback for incoming alerts. Other watchOS 3.2 improvements include Scribble in three new languages, a new audible alert on your wrist after you unlock your Mac with your Apple Watch and a minor visual change in the companion Watch app, which now displays a handy progress bar when songs are being transferred to your wrist-worn device for untethered listening. Everything new in watchOS 3.2 Here’s Andrew’s hands-on video with what’s new in watchOS 3.2: Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube watchOS 3.2 changelog The official changelog lists the following improvements in watchOS 3.2: Siri now works with apps from the App Store to start workouts, send messages, make payments, book rides and more Theater Mode setting turns on silent mode and keeps the screen dark until you tap it, even when you raise your wrist Scribble is now available in French, Spanish, and Italian Music playlist sync progress is now displayed in the Apple Watch app on iPhone Aside from the aforementioned enhancements and new features, watchOS 3.2 also includes additional improvements and bug fixes and is recommended for all users. For the security content of watchOS 3.2, read Apple’s support document. How are you liking the watchOS 3.2 update thus far? Do you imagine yourself using Theater Mode when watching movies? Can you think up other scenarios where Theater Mode may be a handy feature? Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend Hands-on video: Theater Mode for Apple Watch in watchOS 3.2 watchOS 3.2 with Theater Mode, Siri in apps & more now available for Apple Watch Apple seeds macOS Sierra 10.12.4 beta 8 and watchOS 3.2 beta 7 Apple seeds beta 6 of watchos 3.2 and tvOS 10.2 Related Topics Apple, Apple Watch, News, Theater Mode, Video, watchOS, watchOS 3, watchOS 3.2 Ian Ellis Curious, after updating watch will it still work with iPhone jailbroken on ios 10.2, or does it force a phone update as well? SPQRGuyMontag My understanding is the phone has to be up to date to update the watch. If you force update the watch using another device, then it will no longer recognize the jailbroken phone. Lion You can’t update the watch to 3.2 if you don’t update your iPhone to 10.3 first jennyzeroo The update is … fine. Siri for apps is fine. I suppose it’ll affect things at some point. Theater mode is fine. i think these are more “noteworthy” than “newsworthy”. But whatever. I think similar to the iPad, the Apple Watch has TONS of potential. It really up to Apple to put the time into the SW and apps to use it. Lots of apps don’t seem fully optimized for the watch. Why can’t I download podcasts to the watch podcast app? Why ISN’T there an actual podcast app?Seems pretty basic for a smart watch and LOTS of people are asking for it. Why can’t I control when and which network the watch connects to? instead it goes into iCloud for networks, but I don’t want my phone and iPad to connect to 2.4 all the time,……annoying. Just skipping advertising in a podcast while working out is five key presses to get to the now playing app. Which is a little buggy in itself. just because I’m working out doesn’t mean that’s the ONLY app I ever want to look at or use.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Here’s everything Samsung unveiled today Daily Deals: $40 Sony Bluetooth headphones, $10 DreamWorks movies, and more Hands on with what’s new in watchOS 3.2 Apple starts rejecting submissions with pricing info in app titles, screenshots & more GigSky’s data plans now available in 180+ countries with Apple SIM   The latest jailbreak news Possible tvOS 10.1.1 jailbreak may be coming after all The best jailbreak tweaks for the Messages app Get an edge-to-edge Control Center interface in iOS 10 with NoCCFloating Luca Todesco announces his departure from the jailbreak community Last chance to downgrade from iOS 10.3 betas and save blobs for iOS 10.2.1 iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2017.

Twitter Cisco expands wireless reach with access points, management software Cisco targets SMB arena with new Aironet APs, Mobility Express software. Michael Cooney (Network World) 30 March, 2017 02:00 - - - - print email Comments Perhaps nowhere is the challenge of keeping up with the onslaught of wireless devices greater than in the small-to-midsized companies with little or no IT expertise to handle it. That’s the target for Cisco’s latest line of 802.11ac Wave 2-based wireless products which include scalable Aironet wireless access points and a new version of Cisco’s Mobility Express software to manage the whole environment. +More on Network World: When the Internet Engineering Task Force meets this week in Chicago it will have a new chair – Cisco Fellow Alissa Cooper + The need for faster, more easily managed wireless networks is obvious: Cisco said in its in Cisco’s 11th annual Visual Networking Index last year that traffic from wireless and mobile devices will account for two-thirds of total IP traffic by 2020. By 2020, wired devices will account for 34% of IP traffic, while Wi-Fi and mobile devices will account for 66% of IP traffic. In 2015, wired devices accounted for most IP traffic at 52%. Cisco says that by 2020 there will be 26.3 billion networked devices averaging a speed of 24Mbps. Not only will there be more devices, but mobile business applications in the workplace, generating more traffic. An updated version of Mobility Express in fact may be the key to the current announcement as it includes support for the “fast lane” technology Cisco and Apple have been developing since the companies announced a technology development partnership in 2015. In this case, Cisco said that customers can pick the Apple iOS apps they want to receive prioritized network bandwidth, which is especially important for apps that use real-time services such as video and voice. +More on Network World: Cisco Talos warns of Apple iOS and MacOS X.509 certificate flaw+ In addition, Mobility Express basically includes all the embedded intelligence needed to run and manage SMB wireless environments, Cisco said. The package now supports up to 100 access points – the previous version was limited to 25 --and can be configured in less than10 minutes, Cisco says. Mobility Express supports the 802.11ac Wave 2 standards and other features previously available only in high performance, standalone WLAN Controllers. A small and midsize enterprise will now be able to offer the same high-speed, feature-laden network that larger organizations use, according to Bill Rubino, Cisco Enterprise Mobility Solutions marketing manager.   In addition, the new version Mobility Express: Runs WLAN controller function on an access point supporting up to 2,000 clients. Offers Plug-and-Play for zero touch deployment. Lets customers understand exactly what is running on their network. Supports and manages guests via Wi-Fi Onboarding with Presence Analytics. With this application customers can see and analyze network guest activity. On the hardware side, Cisco is offering up Aironet 1815 Series Access Point family for indoor networking; the Aironet 1540 Access Point for outdoor; and a new WLAN controller, the Cisco 3504. Cisco The Aironet 1815 802.11ac Wave 2-based devices come in four configurations, the 1815i is the overall ideal solution for any small-to-midsized business; 1815t is targeted for teleworks and micro-branch deployments; The 1815w is targeted at hospitality, residential halls or other multi-dwelling units and the 1815m has more transmit power for budget-conscious organizations that need a wide coverage zone. The 1815 family fills out Cisco’s Aironet portfolio as it offers the 2800 and 3800 for larger enterprise wireless deployments. For wireless outdoor networks, a market growing 15% to 20% quarter over quarter, Cisco says, the company rolled out the Aironet 1540 Access Point he 1540 AP supports the 802.11ac Wave 2 standard and comes equipped with Cisco enterprise features. The 1540s can transmit data up to twice as fast as Cisco’s previous outdoor access point and can perform double duty as virtual WLAN controllers, the company says. “Customers can run wireless networks without buying separate controller and it includes the enterprise-class Cisco RF management capabilities—like security scanning, interference avoidance and application visibility,” Rubino said. Cisco At the top end of this announcement is the Cisco 3504 WLAN Access Controller. The access point scales to 150 access points and supports 3,000 clients. It too supports Apple fast lane technology, BYOD services, Trustsec and Open DNS features for managing larger wireless environments. The wireless update will bolster the company’s wireless stance versus HPE Aruba, Ruckus (now with Brocade); Extreme, Aerohive, Juniper and others. All products are available in April apart from the 3504 which is available in the June timeframe. Pricing for the 3504 has not been set. Pricing for the other devices goes like this: Aironet 1540 Outdoor AP: $995; Aironet 1815 Indoor Series AP: 1815i (Infrastructure) AP: $495; 1815t (teleworker) AP: $595; 1815w (wallplate) AP: $495; 1815m (higher coverage) AP: $595.

By Oliver Cragg March 29, 2017 16:25 BST Samsung is back with the Galaxy S8, but how does it compare to Apple's iOS champion?Samsung / Apple Samsung has officially unveiled its Android flagship for 2017, the Galaxy S8 – a smartphone that Samsung is hoping will finally exorcise the fiery demons from the Galaxy Note 7 debacle and reclaim the South Korean giant's crown in the mobile market. Outclassing its predecessor, the Galaxy S7, thanks to impressive specs, an eye-catching design and key new features, one big question remains: How does it compare to the smartphone sector's current tog dog, Apple's iPhone 7? With the iOS vs Android war set to rage once again, here are our early thoughts on which mobile device will rule the roost... at least until the iPhone 8 comes around. Samsung Galaxy S8 vs iPhone 7: Specification Samsung Galaxy S8 iPhone 7 Screen size 5.8in 4.7in Screen resolution and pixel density 2960 x 1440, 570 per inch 750 x 1334, 326 per inch Size 148.9 x 68.1 x 8.0mm 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm Weight 155g 138g Storage options 64GB (expandable up to 256GB via microSD card) 32GB, 128GB, 256GB Cameras 12MP rear, 8MP front 12MP rear, 7MP front Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 octa-core Apple A10 Fusion quad-core Battery 3,000 mAh 1960 mAh Ports USB-C, headphone jack Lightning Colour options Midnight Black, Orchid Grey and Artic Silver Black, Jet Black, Silver, Gold, Rose Gold, Red (special edition) Price from £689 £599 Samsung Galaxy S8 vs iPhone 7: Display Samsung has a fancy new name and a much taller 5.8in "Infinity Display" for its 2017 flagship, packing an extended 18:9 aspect ratio that eliminates bezel room and curves along each edge beautifully. There's also a resolution bump from the Galaxy S7 up to 2960 x 1440 and all the colour vibrancy we've come to expect from Samsung's AMOLED panels. The iPhone 7's 4.7in retina screen has a tough task to match Samsung's flagship here, although additional display interactions via 3D Touch technology is a nice bonus. Smartphone users unwilling to move away from physical home buttons might also take issue with Samsung's on-screen keys with haptic feedback. Apple's static, "taptic" button isn't exactly traditional, but for those that want to keep their keys off the screen, the iPhone 7 still holds the upper hand in this minor department. Samsung Galaxy S8 vs iPhone 7: Camera The larger iPhone 7 Plus got the real killer camera when it comes to Apple's current smartphone family, with two rear lenses and optical zoom. That being said, there is still plenty to love about the 12 megapixel f/1.8 sensor and the 7 megapixel selfie snapper, not to mention Apple's excellent take on "bokeh" effects. The Galaxy S8, meanwhile, has the same 12 megapixel rear sensor as the Galaxy S7 but with improved low-light performance. The Galaxy S7 excelled in the camera department and sticking with its top-tier module for a second year does make some sense. While it may not lead the pack at this point – the Google Pixel camera takes some beating – there will likely be enough here to love. Samsung is also boosting the front facing camera to 8 megapixels from 7 megapixels on the S7. Samsung Galaxy S8 vs iPhone 7: Processor, storage and colour options The iPhone 7 sports Apple top-end A10 Fusion, quad-core processor, which sounds a little underwhelming on paper, but functions beautifully in practice. On the other hand, Samsung's Galaxy S8 introduces the world to Qualcomm's latest flagship chipset, the Snapdragon 835. A full comparison will have to wait until we get more hands-on time with the device, but early tests suggest it is an absolute powerhouse. On the storage side, Apple finally ditched the 16GB base model for a much more acceptable 32GB, with options going all the way up to 256GB. There's a clear winner here though as the Galaxy S8 comes with 64GB as standard and expandable storage up to 256GB via a microSD card slot. In the UK, the Galaxy S8 will be available in Midnight Black, Orchid Grey and Artic Silver, while the iPhone 7 comes in Jet Black, Black, Silver, Gold, Rose Gold, and, in an iPhone first, the recently revealed special edition Red colourway. Samsung Galaxy S8 vs iPhone 7: Price The iPhone 7 starts at £599 for the 32GB version, £699 for the 128GB and £799 for the 256GB model. Pricing for the Galaxy S8 has yet to be confirmed, but retailer leaks have suggested a figure of £689. Samsung Galaxy S8 vs iPhone 7: Bixby takes on Siri and early verdict In truth, both the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S8 are fine smartphones that are packed to the teeth with software features, water-resistance and fingerprint sensors that would make any potential buyer happy. The key difference, as ever, is the OS. Samsung's lightly-skinned version of Android 7.0 Nougat strips back the bloatware of old for a sleek experience, but still lacks the dignified purity of Apple's iOS. The OS comparison also extends to each UI's assistant, with Samsung entering the digital assistant race with its own horse, Bixby. It's a horrible name, but the features make it a viable alternative to Google Assistant, especially thanks to the dedicated physical Bixby button. That being said, we do love Siri and its quirky ways. There are other reasons to pick one or the other – especially if you have a nice pair of headphones and really need a 3.5mm jack which the Galaxy S8 has, but the iPhone 7 notoriously does not – but the choice here is really between Android and iOS. If you have a lot of Google Play apps then the Galaxy S8 is a strong contender to Google's Pixel as the best Android device on the market. If you have a swathe of iOS software you wouldn't want to lose, then the iPhone 7 is the best smartphone Apple has ever made. This is the small matter of Apple's 10-year anniversary iPhone due later this year, but for now, either smartphone is more than worthy of a place in your pocket.

Samsung just needs to avoid the same battery problems that plagued the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7. The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are easily the best-looking smartphones of the year so far, thanks to what Samsung is billing as an "Infinity Display" that runs side to side and almost top to bottom. The two phones are identical except for size: The S8 display measures 5.8 inches diagonally while the S8+ is 6.2 inches. Both are a lot bigger than the competing phones from Apple — the iPhone 7 is only 4.7 inches and the iPhone 7 Plus measures 5.5 inches. Devin Hance | CNBC CNBC: Galaxy S8 3 Plus, the phones are almost all screen, which means you get more space to work with. The home button is gone, replaced by a small area at the bottom of the screen that can be pushed in at any moment to return to the home screen. It works well and feels a bit magical in its execution. Apple is rumored to be considering something similar for the iPhone 8, which it totally should. Samsung's displays, which use AMOLED technology, are gorgeous for watching videos and generally pop with color. An iPhone with a similar display would easily outclass any iPhone before it, and potentially pave the way for VR, which relies on the sharper screens. Apple could also treat customers with larger displays without increasing the overall size of the iPhone if it adopts a similar strategy. It's something Apple should do as folks clamor for bigger spaces to game, watch movies and even multitask while sending emails. Devin Hance | CNBC CNBC: Galaxy S8 2 Samsung managed to squeeze nearly every latest piece of tech into the Galaxy S8. You'll find Qualcomm's most advanced Snapdragon processor inside, which means the phones will support the next generation of super-fast wireless data networks (gigabit LTE, sometimes called 5G) when they roll out later this year. It should also offer better battery life and great support for processor-intensive apps like games. You'll also find the latest version of Android installed (Android Nougat), which has support for running applications side by side, the latest performance and security patches and built-in battery life savings. There are also a variety of security features that would fill 007's Q with envy, including an iris scanner, a face recognition mechanism and a fingerprint reader. All worked rather well during our tests, though the fingerprint reader is on the back of the phone. It's a bad idea since the Galaxy S8's glass rear panel is extremely prone to fingerprints. Every device in our demo looked pretty gross. Devin Hance | CNBC CNBC: Galaxy S8 6 There are other niceties in tow. The Galaxy S8 is water and dust resistant, so it can easily take a dunk in the pool (or the toilet!) and survive. It also comes with expandable storage, something Apple still doesn't include in the iPhone. That's important, since both models will only ship with 64GB of space. That space runs out pretty quick when you load up 4K videos, which you'll want to do if you plan to take advantage of the optional Gear VR headset or the phone's stellar screen. Samsung's planning plenty of accessories for the Galaxy S8, though it's unclear when some of the cooler ones are launching. A "DeX" dock, for example, allows the phone to operate as a full computer. Attach a keyboard, mouse and HDMI display, and you're off to the races running Android programs in an environment that looks a bit like a standard desktop computer. Devin Hance | CNBC CNBC: Galaxy S8 A new voice assistant named Bixby also lives on the Galaxy S8. It's Samsung's take on Siri and will allow you to check the weather, sports scores, schedule meetings and more. There's a dedicated button for bringing up the assistant – not exactly unique since you can hold the home button on an iPhone to do the same for Siri – or you can speak "Bixby" to bring the AI to life. Samsung's demo units weren't running Bixby properly just yet, however, so the jury's still out on how well it works. Plus, since the phones run Android, the excellent Google Assistant is also preinstalled, so it's not clear who Bixby is really for (except to show that Samsung can do AI). The Galaxy Note 7 won plenty of praise last year but was ultimately recalled not once, but twice. Samsung's Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ seem promising, and are certainly exciting devices both in person and on paper. Consumers will need to be cautious, though. It will take time, not just a couple of shiny new phablets, to earn back trust.

The device comes in two models with different screen sizes - the 5.8-inch Galaxy S8 and 6.2-inch Galaxy S8 Plus. Some of the key features of the device include a so-called "infinity display", giving the device a bezel-less curved edge and a 12 megapixel back camera. For the top five features, click here. CNBC also got hands-on time with the product. "The high-end big phone market is growing and we had a challenge of as you mentioned, people getting a bit tired of renewing their phone with the same design. So we decided to take a big step forward and change the design," Jean-Daniel Ayme, Samsung's corporate vice president for mobile in Europe, told CNBC in an interview. The Galaxy S8 is potentially one of Samsung's most important device launches of recent times as it faces stiff competition from the likes of Apple and Huawei, a maturing smartphone market, and seeks to make the Note 7 episode - in which it was forced to recall and discontinue the smartphone because they were catching fire - a distant memory. "The S8 is a unquestionably a strong product but Samsung must now deliver a faultless launch to move on from the difficulties of 2017. If this happens it will emerge in an even stronger position," Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, told CNBC by email. "With the Samsung Galaxy S8 breaking design boundaries and with high expectations for a significant upgrade to the iPhone to mark the product's tenth anniversary, 2017 could be the year that sees smartphones emerge from an innovation slumber." When asked by CNBC if he is confident the Galaxy S8 won't face any problems like the Note 7, Ayme said "absolutely", pointing to a new quality control measures the company has put in place. Meet Bixby Samsung also revealed Bixby, a smart voice assistant to rival Apple's Siri. It will be able to answer questions you ask, but Samsung highlighted how it's different. One use case involved taking a picture of a monument and Bixby being able to tell you information about this as well as recommendations of restaurants nearby. Another example allowed a user to ask Bixby to bring up all the photos taken in London. While Bixby's functions will be limited at the beginning, functionality will grow. To this end, Samsung Connect was also launched. It's an app that allows users to control a number of internet-connected home devices such as TVs or refrigerators. Bixby will launch with the ability to understand American English and Korean. Samsung is working with partners to allow Bixby to control other apps and appliances. Arjun Kharpal | CNBC Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus on display in a briefing in London ahead of the launch. "We will enrich it with partnerships with other companies like Amazon for buying things or for displaying information about monuments," Ayme said. Bixby could give Samsung the ability to differentiate its device versus other Android players and Apple, analysts said, which could drive sales. "Voice is the easiest way to interact with the phone, you can just ask, and you don't need to go through apps. Those who are able to provide the best experience will win this game," Francisco Jeronimo, research director of mobile devices for Europe at IDC, told CNBC by phone. "If you are engaged, and used to use something like Siri and it gives you a good experience, you will buy an iPhone. If Bixby is better than Siri there is more chance for Samsung to sell more phones." Jeronimo also called Bixby the "most important announcement" in Samsung's history. The full story about Samsung's strategy behind Bixby can be found here. Shipments expected to beat S7 Samsung has launched the S8 several months before Apple is expected to release its hotly-anticipated iPhone. Samsung's flagship is usually launched before Apple. Several analysts that spoke to CNBC have praised the phone's innovative design and technological capability and are expecting strong sales. Devin Hance | CNBC CNBC: Galaxy S8 6 Counterpoint Research expects Samsung to ship close to 50 million of the devices in 2017. That would be more than the 48 million S7 and S7 Edge models shipped by Samsung, according to IHS Markit. "The GS8 is likely to start shipping later than the GS7 did (April '17 versus March '16), however we are expecting a higher monthly run rate from the GS8 meaning its overall first 12 months of sales will be as much as 10 percent up on the Galaxy S7," Peter Richardson, research director at Counterpoint told CNBC by email. IHS Markit is expecting Samsung to ship 331 million smartphones in 2017, up, 6.8 percent year-on-year. Turn your phone into a PC The South Korean electronics giant also unveiled a new feature called Dex. It's a device that users can dock a Galaxy S8 on, then plug into a monitor or TV, effectively turning it into a PC. It runs a version of Google's Android operating system optimized for a larger screen. Samsung also said several apps such as Google's YouTube were optimized for the bigger screen. Arjun Kharpal | CNBC A Samsung Galaxy S8 sits in the docking station called Dex. It can be connected to a monitor or TV effectively turning it into an Android-run PC. Samsung also used its launch event to unveil a new Gear 360 camera which allows users to film 360-degree video and broadcast this to sites such as YouTube or Facebook. It's the firm's second generation version of the device, as it pushes further into virtual reality and keep users locked into Samsung's ecosystem of devices. "Beyond the S8, Samsung is building a compelling range of additional accessories such as the its Gear smartwatches, Gear 360 camera and Gear VR headset which all serve to enhance consumer perceptions of the S8 at a complete package," Wood said.

Michael Cooney (Network World) 30 March, 2017 02:00 - - - - print email Distributors Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Dicker Data Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology Synnex Westcon – Comstor Comments Perhaps nowhere is the challenge of keeping up with the onslaught of wireless devices greater than in the small-to-midsized companies with little or no IT expertise to handle it. That’s the target for Cisco’s latest line of 802.11ac Wave 2-based wireless products which include scalable Aironet wireless access points and a new version of Cisco’s Mobility Express software to manage the whole environment. +More on Network World: When the Internet Engineering Task Force meets this week in Chicago it will have a new chair – Cisco Fellow Alissa Cooper + The need for faster, more easily managed wireless networks is obvious: Cisco said in its in Cisco’s 11th annual Visual Networking Index last year that traffic from wireless and mobile devices will account for two-thirds of total IP traffic by 2020. By 2020, wired devices will account for 34% of IP traffic, while Wi-Fi and mobile devices will account for 66% of IP traffic. In 2015, wired devices accounted for most IP traffic at 52%. Cisco says that by 2020 there will be 26.3 billion networked devices averaging a speed of 24Mbps. Not only will there be more devices, but mobile business applications in the workplace, generating more traffic. An updated version of Mobility Express in fact may be the key to the current announcement as it includes support for the “fast lane” technology Cisco and Apple have been developing since the companies announced a technology development partnership in 2015. In this case, Cisco said that customers can pick the Apple iOS apps they want to receive prioritized network bandwidth, which is especially important for apps that use real-time services such as video and voice. +More on Network World: Cisco Talos warns of Apple iOS and MacOS X.509 certificate flaw+ In addition, Mobility Express basically includes all the embedded intelligence needed to run and manage SMB wireless environments, Cisco said. The package now supports up to 100 access points – the previous version was limited to 25 --and can be configured in less than10 minutes, Cisco says. Mobility Express supports the 802.11ac Wave 2 standards and other features previously available only in high performance, standalone WLAN Controllers. A small and midsize enterprise will now be able to offer the same high-speed, feature-laden network that larger organizations use, according to Bill Rubino, Cisco Enterprise Mobility Solutions marketing manager.   In addition, the new version Mobility Express: Runs WLAN controller function on an access point supporting up to 2,000 clients. Offers Plug-and-Play for zero touch deployment. Lets customers understand exactly what is running on their network. Supports and manages guests via Wi-Fi Onboarding with Presence Analytics. With this application customers can see and analyze network guest activity. On the hardware side, Cisco is offering up Aironet 1815 Series Access Point family for indoor networking; the Aironet 1540 Access Point for outdoor; and a new WLAN controller, the Cisco 3504. Cisco The Aironet 1815 802.11ac Wave 2-based devices come in four configurations, the 1815i is the overall ideal solution for any small-to-midsized business; 1815t is targeted for teleworks and micro-branch deployments; The 1815w is targeted at hospitality, residential halls or other multi-dwelling units and the 1815m has more transmit power for budget-conscious organizations that need a wide coverage zone. The 1815 family fills out Cisco’s Aironet portfolio as it offers the 2800 and 3800 for larger enterprise wireless deployments. For wireless outdoor networks, a market growing 15% to 20% quarter over quarter, Cisco says, the company rolled out the Aironet 1540 Access Point he 1540 AP supports the 802.11ac Wave 2 standard and comes equipped with Cisco enterprise features. The 1540s can transmit data up to twice as fast as Cisco’s previous outdoor access point and can perform double duty as virtual WLAN controllers, the company says. “Customers can run wireless networks without buying separate controller and it includes the enterprise-class Cisco RF management capabilities—like security scanning, interference avoidance and application visibility,” Rubino said. Cisco At the top end of this announcement is the Cisco 3504 WLAN Access Controller. The access point scales to 150 access points and supports 3,000 clients. It too supports Apple fast lane technology, BYOD services, Trustsec and Open DNS features for managing larger wireless environments. The wireless update will bolster the company’s wireless stance versus HPE Aruba, Ruckus (now with Brocade); Extreme, Aerohive, Juniper and others. All products are available in April apart from the 3504 which is available in the June timeframe. Pricing for the 3504 has not been set. Pricing for the other devices goes like this: Aironet 1540 Outdoor AP: $995; Aironet 1815 Indoor Series AP: 1815i (Infrastructure) AP: $495; 1815t (teleworker) AP: $595; 1815w (wallplate) AP: $495; 1815m (higher coverage) AP: $595.

Pushing buttons Peter Nowak: The internet’s ruin begins with gadget fanboys One way to get a sense of where the technology industry winds are currently blowing is to take a look at which companies Samsung is emulating. By that measure, judging by the host of products announced by the South Korean electronics giant this week, Apple is yesterday’s news. It’s a Google and Amazon world we’re living in now. Samsung’s marquee new product is, of course, the Galaxy S8 and its larger S8 Plus sibling. The flagship smartphones, going on sale in certain markets in April, will be hugely important for the company. The S8 is Samsung’s effort at a rebound from the unmitigated disaster that was the Galaxy Note 7, which was subject to a global recall and then cancellation because of faulty batteries. The fiasco is costing Samsung billions of dollars in lost profits and brand damage. I had some time with the new Galaxy devices at a press event in Toronto this week, and they look solid. Whether the batteries can keep from exploding, only time will tell. The S8 phones have been redesigned so that they’re almost all screen now. Their physical home buttons have been removed and replaced with a virtual one built right into the displays. The same goes for the fingerprint sensor. About 83 per cent of the devices’ surface areas are now displays, according to Samsung. There’s almost no bezel, so that’s a lot of visual real estate on the 5.8-inch S8 and the 6.2-inch S8 Plus. The devices’ big new feature, however, is the addition of Bixby, Samsung’s take on the personal voice assistant. Bixby can answer trivia questions, set calendar events and provide general help based on predicting its users’ behaviour. If you call your spouse every day at a certain time, for example, it will eventually remind you to do so if you forget. It’s hard not to draw comparisons to Google Assistant, which launched on Google’s Pixel phones in the autumn and recently expanded to other Android devices. Samsung says Bixby has a leg up on its competitor because it also has visual intelligence. Point your phone’s camera at a product, for example, and it will bring up a list of places online where that item can be purchased. There are existing apps out there that perform similar functions, including Google Goggles, so it remains to be seen how this function is unique or whether it really is an advantage. One thing is certain at this point – Samsung feels like it has to be in the artificial intelligence space because of what its competitors are doing. Google Assistant is itself a response to Amazon’s artificially intelligent Alexa tool, which is quickly invading a wide cross-section of products, from home speakers and appliances to cars. Amazon recently added Alexa capability to its iPhone app, which means the company is going to make inroads in the mobile world despite not even having its own phone. Alexa is ironically competing with Apple’s own AI assistant Siri on the iPhone, a situation that Samsung also now finds itself in. Since the Galaxy S8 is an Android device, users will be able to choose between Bixby and Google Assistant. In both cases, Amazon and Google hold big leads over Apple and Samsung in what is becoming an increasingly important technology. Besides Bixby, the South Kor­ean company is also emulating Google with several other new products. The upcoming Samsung Connect Home is similar to Google Wi-Fi, a home router released by the search company late last year. Both aim to deliver better Wi-Fi connections and home automation. Samsung is also adding a hand-held controller to its Gear VR virtual reality headset. The cynic might suggest it’s a blatant copy of the controller included with Google’s Daydream View headset, which launched last autumn. The new product line-up brings up memories of Apple suing Samsung in 2011 for allegedly copying the iPhone and iPad. Apple charged that Samsung had ripped off basic ideas with its Galaxy line-up, including the look and feel of the respective products. US courts agreed and awarded Apple hundreds of millions of dollars in damages. The final amount is still being disputed in appeals courts. There isn’t much trace of Apple’s products in Samsung’s new line-up, but it probably isn’t because of any remaining sting from that lawsuit. It’s more likely because the iPhone maker hasn’t done much of interest in years. The real action is coming from Google and Amazon. And now, just like then, Samsung doesn’t want to get left behind. The tech week’s winner and loser Winner of the Week: Souq.com. After months of speculation, the Dubai-based online marketplace has finally been acquired by Amazon. While it might not have fetched the billion-dollar valuation the company had previously been estimated it, the sale still represents a win for investors and saves Souq from the difficult task of finding growth opportunities. Loser of the Week: American internet users. The US Congress on Tuesday voted against online privacy rules, thereby allowing internet providers to sell information on consumers’ browsing habits to advertisers without their consent.

Blanchard joined Apple in 2011 and led the development and QA teams for Apple Mail until joining Readdle this month. While it’s unclear exactly why Blanchard has decided to part ways with Apple,he does hint that he shares “a fundamental vision of what the future of email should be” with Readdle. The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac “Spark is modernizing email as we know it. We share a fundamental vision of what the future of email should be,” said Blanchard. “I’ve always admired Readdle for their beautiful and innovative products, which makes them the ideal company to turn that vision into a reality.” Readdle’s 105 member team is headquartered in Odessa, Ukraine, but Blanchard will remain in Silicon Valley where he’ll lead a team and office for Spark. Readdle currently claims around 65 million downloads of its popular productivity apps including PDF Expert, Scanner Pro, Calendars 5, Documents and others. The Spark app is relatively new in comparison to the company’s other apps, having first launched for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch in May 2015 and then on the Mac last November. The Spark email app is available as a free download on the App Store for iPhone and iPad and Mac. Terry Blanchard and the Spark team Former Apple Mail engineering manager joins Readdle to build future of email with Spark. Terry Blanchard spent the last 6 years leading the Engineering and QA teams responsible for Apple Mail which is used by millions of people worldwide. “Spark is modernizing email as we know it. We share a fundamental vision of what the future of email should be,” said Blanchard. “I’ve always admired Readdle for their beautiful and innovative products, which makes them the ideal company to turn that vision into a reality.” Spark is one of the most popular email applications, winning numerous awards from Apple (best of 2015 on iOS, and 2016 on Mac). It is often regarded as a preferred 3rd party email client by industry experts and media. Igor Zhadanov, Readdle CEO shares his vision and expansion plans: “Email is not going anywhere and has to be reinvented. The team has done a phenomenal job so far and we are committed to shaping the future of email. Terry is a valuable addition to the team and brings years of experience from one of the best companies in the world. He will be building a rockstar team in Silicon Valley and leading an office there”. Readdle has an extensive history of making innovative productivity apps since the very first day of the App Store. Popular apps such as Scanner Pro, PDF Expert, Documents and Calendars 5 often defined and shaped app categories on iOS, such as mobile document scanning, document management, calendaring, PDF editing and now email. These apps have been downloaded over 65 million times.  Readdle is a 105 member team with an HQ in Odessa, Ukraine and has built a profitable business without the need to raise external capital. The Readdle team aims to shape the future of work, and email is a central part of that vision. Spark is currently available on iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch. It recently received a huge update with labels, folder management, and smart filters. The team is working on an Android version and plans to add Calendar, automations and team mechanics.”  Jordan Kahn @JordanKahn Jordan writes about all things Apple as Senior Editor of 9to5Mac, & contributes to 9to5Google, 9to5Toys, & Electrek.co.

Added by Agency Staff on 29 March 2017. Saved under News, Top Tags: Galaxy S8, Samsung, Samsung Electronics, Samsung Galaxy S8 Tweet Samsung Electronics knows it needs to get its new flagship smartphone right. Apart from making sure the gadget won’t cause bodily harm, the company packed it with a plethora of new features: taller, curved screens, encrypted facial recognition, deeper display colours, system-wide voice control and the ability to turn into a desktop computer. The Galaxy S8 comes in two sizes, a standard 5,8-inch display model and a Plus version with a 6,2-inch screen. Both are larger than the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the lineup’s main competition until Apple rolls out its 10th-anniversary iPhone later this year. In line with smartphone trends, Samsung’s new devices feature slimmer bezels alongside the display and are curved on all four corners. Pre-orders will begin soon after the unveiling, ahead of the S8’s 21 April release. It comes in five colours: midnight black, maple gold, coral blue, arctic silver and orchid grey. The S8 represents Samsung’s biggest prospect for a turnaround after the Note7 debacle last year.  The bigger-sized smartphone debuted to positive reviews, only to be killed off after some units showed a tendency to catch fire and explode, forcing the South Korean manufacturer to yank the product off shelves. The crisis cost the company more than US$6bn and its global lead in smartphone sales. Samsung accounted for 17,8% of global smartphone sales in the last three months of 2016, slightly less than Apple, according to Gartner. While Samsung may be targeting Apple, it also faces challenges from up-and-coming rivals such as Huawei Technologies and Oppo, especially in China, the world’s biggest smartphone market. “We must not only win back customers’ trust, but also the high expectations that they have always held for Samsung,” said Lee Young-hee, executive vice president of Samsung’s mobile business. “We have put our utmost effort to provide customers with near-perfect devices to earn back their trust.” Also casting a shadow over the S8’s debut is the trial of Jay Y Lee, the Samsung group’s heir apparent and de facto chief, who was arrested on bribery and embezzlement charges stemming from a national influence-peddling scandal. He has denied any wrongdoing. Still, even with the Note 7 imbroglio and legal troubles, Samsung shares have been trading near record highs, thanks to a robust semiconductor business. “With the new Galaxy S8, Samsung wants to restore its brand image back in the market as a technology leader after the Note7 incident,” said Jusy Hong, principal analyst for mobile devices at market researcher IHS Markit. Samsung’s corporate logo is now gone from the front of the device, making room for a taller, 18,5:9 ratio screen, which the company is calling the Infinity Display. The new dimensions mean the thin black bars that typically surround widescreen videos can be eliminated, making them look bigger when played. The home button, with vibrating feedback, is integrated into the bottom of the screen. On the software side, users can now clip specific apps to the top of the screen so that, for instance, they can compose e-mails while reading a Web page. The S8 will also feature a digital assistant that studies its owner’s activities to offer helpful tips and information, seeking to challenge Apple’s Siri and Amazon.com’s Alexa. Called Bixby, Samsung’s service can be activated via the phone’s side button. The system has a few parts: one is a standard, Siri-like voice control view, another is a list view of upcoming calendar appointments and reminders. The feature is also integrated with the camera so that it can identify objects like buildings, or a particular bottle of wine. Users can operate many of the phone’s functions via voice instead of the touchscreen. While some previous Galaxy models let users unlock their device using a facial scanner, the S8 is the first Samsung phone to encrypt facial data. Combined with iris and fingerprint scanning, that can be used to offer more security for mobile banking and other sensitive applications. Another new trick: the new Samsung phones can essentially become a full-blown desktop computer via a separately sold docking station called the DeX (an idea introduced by Motorola in 2011). The phone will add upgraded front and rear cameras, and continue to include wireless charging. The camera app will include built-in Snapchat-like stickers that can be placed over images. Unsurprisingly, Samsung is touting the safety of the S8’s battery, given that the cause of the Note7 fires was due to faulty battery design. A Samsung television commercial released earlier this year shows engineers testing batteries by drilling a hole and apparently heating them in what the company called an “eight-point battery safety check”. The company says the standard S8 model has a 3 000mAh battery while the Plus version has a capacity of 3 500mAh. “Success isn’t going to come overnight for the S8 and it’ll be a while before consumers feel confident the phone has no problems like the Note7,” said Koo Chang-hwan, who researches corporate brands at Seoul-based Korea Reputation Centre. “The biggest issue hobbling the company is still the trial of its de facto chief. That will overshadow the S8 and a single product may not be enough to put the risk surrounding the top executive behind.”  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 62Expert warns SA on too much renewable energy 11Telkom to hike line rental fees 6Google’s ad crisis deepens 5Journalists named to interim SABC board 5Suspected vandals again cause Telkom disruption Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

Here’s the truth about claims Apple is planning to render the iPhone 5 obsolete Industry experts are worried the end is nigh for one of the tech giant's most popular smartphones by Jasper Hamill 29th March 2017, 2:56 pm Updated: 29th March 2017, 4:11 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments EXPERTS have claimed that Apple is about to cease support for older iPhones, making them totally redundant and potentially vulnerable to hack attack. However, The Sun Online believes rumours about the demise of this much-loved mobile have been greatly exaggerated. Alamy 2 A view of the iPhone 5, which was the first model to feature the small Lightning connector to charge the phone and transfer data The tech giant is about to roll out a minor update of iOS, the operating system which powers iPhones and iPads. Some analysts are claiming it contains a surprise for people who own the iPhone 5 or models before it. These gadgets use 32-bit processors, but Apple’s modern phones now use 64-bit processors. Tech detectives have dug into the code of a small update called iOS 10.3.2, which follows yesterday’s release of iOS 10.3. Zeph McLearan, an IT specialist, published a tweet in which he claimed that he could find no mention of any older 32-bit devices in the iOS update. @TheApplePost Strange thing I found in iOS 10.3.2 beta, lack of 32bit devices pic.twitter.com/e15ZKk8z8N — Zeph McLearan (@zmclearan) March 29, 2017 This led the website Apple Insider to suggest the tech firm was about to stop supporting the iPhone 5, the cheaper iPhone 5c  and the 4th generation of iPad – although this would seem like a strange decision. “Anecdotally, it would be a peculiar move for Apple to draw the line and end 32-bit device support with what is considered to be a minor point update,” Apple Insider wrote. “Such an announcement is more likely to take place at this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference on June 5, where Apple is expected to detail iOS 11. “It dropped support for the iPhone 4 last year and announced that iOS 10 would not run on the device.” However, The Sun understands that a separate update is on the way for the iPhone 5, but this has not been officially confirmed. Until we know more about this update, it is impossible to say whether the smartphone will be updated for years to come – or cast out into the digital darkness forever. iPhone 7 Plus survives for 13 hours in ice-covered subarctic waters in Siberia Getty Images 2 Many people are still using their iPhone 5, which is famous for its robustness and classic design Related Stories GO GO GADGET The Samsung Galaxy S8 has finally been unveiled - here's the lowdown RISE OF THE ROBOTS Domino's unveil plans to deliver pizzas using self-driving ROBOTS in Europe FIREMAN SAMSUNG Samsung promises its Galaxy S8 has been tested rigorously to make sure it won't burst into flames PLAYING WITH FIRE Samsung hopes Galaxy S8 will 'repair damage' caused by flammable smartphone scandal THE GALAXY S8 IS HERE Check out our hands-on review of the much-anticipated Samsung Galaxy S8 MAN VS MACHINE One robot can put more than SIX humans out of a job, experts say APPLE OF MY EYE iPhone 8 may feature a revolutionary new camera that can shoot 3D holographic images OUT OF JUICE?

Although exact sales figures are hard to come by, we know five million were sold across the world during the first weekend after its release. Tech firms cannot reasonably support old gadgets forever and Apple has kept up support for the iPhone 5 ever since it was released in 2012. In the last year, it has begun warning users that old 32bit apps could slow down their iPhone. When trying to open these older apps, some people also claimed to have been shown a message which said: "This app will not work with future versions of iOS." If Apple does decide to stop the latest version of iOS from running on the iPhone 5, this wouldn't stop people's mobiles from working. The gadgets would still function, but it would be impossible to install the latest apps or downloads official Apple patches which close security holes likely to be exploited by hackers.

Samsung’s Bixby lays the groundwork for the company’s smart home play Posted 16 hours ago by Brian Heater (@bheater) 0 SHARES Next Story Samsung adds a controller to the Gear VR, will bundle both with Galaxy S8 pre-orders The Galaxy S8’s main selling point still isn’t fully formed. Announced the week leading up to today’s main event, Bixby is as much a key building block for the company moving forward as it is a shiny new piece of a flagship phone. The company is finally ready to make its play for the smart home, and the new messenger is going to be a key component. Consider this: The company hasn’t been nearly as aggressive in its bid to provide a unifying presence for connected-home devices. Sure, the company picked up SmartThings back in 2014, but the Kickstarter-funded company hasn’t promoted the technology with the same push as Amazon’s Echo or Apple’s HomeKit, even as interest in the technology has skyrocket. Strange, given the fact that it has the pieces to make a uniquely appealing play in a sea of like-minded solutions. After all, Samsung’s got something that Apple, Google and Amazon don’t: its own line of connected-home devices, from smart fridges to robotic vacuums. This week at Unpacked, the company is showcasing some key steps toward unification. In discussing the unveiling, the company has made mention of its “overall ecosystem strategy,” tied together through Bixby Home. The assistant will provide a centralized location akin to Apple Home, wherein users can control and monitor connected devices and set automated multiple smart home behaviors based on things like user proximity or time of day, similar to what Apple offers with Scenes. It’s clear, of course, that the Galaxy S8 is just the first step in Bixby’s growth. It likely won’t be long before the assistant rolls out to the rest of the company’s myriad device categories, starting with the a new router that was also announced at today’s event. Samsung’s growing home router play (which includes a number of 5G devices unveiled at MWC), is one speaker and integrated smart assistant away from taking on Echo and Google Home. Don’t be surprised if the company launches one of these devices by year’s end. Even if Samsung for some reason fails to make good on that promise, the company again has plenty of devices in the wild to lean on. Apple has already made it clear that the Apple TV is going to be a centerpiece of the company’s connected-home strategy. In lieu of a low-priced Echo-like device, the set-top box is the closest the company has to an always-on connect product that can serve as a smart-home hub. Samsung, for its part, has already announced that it’s going all-in on connected sets, giving all sets some level of smartness, moving forward. That’s a tremendous potential install base for the company. Pair that with all of the company’s connected washers and driers, refrigerators and the like, and we’re talking a large population of users who may have already opted into the company’s larger smart-home play without knowing it. It’s for this reason Samsung’s decision to build its own Smart Assistant makes perfect sense. Sure, on mobile Bixby feels like another me-too play as Siri and Alexa are already battling it out for Android users, but Samsung’s move is much larger, and like Amazon’s low-cost Echo, the company has been laying the groundwork all along. That means that, while Bixby is late to the party, adoption should be simple for anyone with a Galaxy device and connected Samsung home product. The company has been laying the groundwork for a larger product ecosystem, and if things go according to plan, the company’s new home assistant will be the thing that connects those dots. Of course, Bixby has to actually make it out into the world. And like Google’s Assistant, the platform’s success will depend in part on how many mobile devices it makes it on to. It was Google’s somewhat delayed roll out that helped open the door for Amazon’s Alexa play on mobile. The S8 and S8+ will launch with the virtual assistant, and certainly the next Note device and any flagship tablets from the company. But in order to make Bixby the ubiquitous language the company is hoping for, it’s going to have to extend beyond even Samsung devices. The company will need to bring its assistant to the Google Play — and dare I say it — Apple App stores. One of the key problems these assistants are working to solve is the creation of a unified, cross-device hub, rather than separate logins for each individual smart-home component. As such, the company will need to ensure that Bixby is integrated with as many devices as possible. The company’s stated third-party support for apps will be a big piece of that puzzle, but opening up the assistant to more mobile platforms will be a solid way to help loop people in to the assistant and overcome the company’s late start to the party. Still, the company will, at the very least, have a unique entry into the ever-escalating fight for the smart home. Like Apple, Amazon and Google, the company has found its own way into the space. And in some respects, Samsung may actually have the strongest potential foundation for a killer smart-home play, between Smart Things and a wide range of connected home appliances. Bixby might be hampered by a late arrival out of the gate, but if the company plays its cards right and delivers some truly seamless integration across devices, it may have hope for uniting the smart home after all. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Samsung Electronics Founded 1969 Overview Samsung Electronics is a South Korean multinational electronics company engaged in consumer electronics, information technology and mobile communications, and device solutions businesses worldwide.

Samsung’s DeX proves the dream of shoving a small computer into a larger one isn’t dead Posted 16 hours ago by Brian Heater (@bheater) 0 SHARES Next Story See you tonight at the Boulder Micro-Meetup Since the dawn of machines, mankind has dreamed of shoving one small computer into a larger one. The vision resurfaced last week in the form of a strange Apple patent for a laptop-style device that slotted in an iPhone in place of the trackpad. Of course, Apple patents all sorts of crazy stuff. That’s just a thing that Apple does. The actual possibilities of such a device coming to market seem, at best, slim. But like clockwork, in amongst a deluge of announcements at today’s Samsung Unpacked event in New York is the DeX, a docking station for the Galaxy S8 that turns the newfangled phone into the base of a desktop computer. The system, designed to “facilitate the mobile workforce” features a swiveling curved HD display and a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Samsung says it worked with Microsoft and Adobe to customize apps for the experience, which I have to say in our quick demo seems to run a lot smoother than older attempts to capture the strange space. The system turns the Android experience into a full desktop (albeit with the limited processing power contained therein) and features  enterprise support from the likes of Citrix, VMware and Amazon. It’s a pretty limited case use, let’s be honest. Samsung’s got work stations at offices in mind here, so employees can just pop their phone and go to work. Though I’ve got to wonder how many road warriors as it were are running around with smartphones and no laptops. It’s an extremely narrow scope that’s plagued the category from the beginning. But it’s never stopped tech companies from reaching for the docking stars. And let’s be honest, the idea of being confined to a niche product category has never stopped Samsung from bringing a product to the market. The history of mobile computing is littered with such devices – small computers that magically transformed into larger ones with the help of a docking companion. And all have suffered a similar fate, courtesy of a limited market. Though in the best known case of the Palm Foleo, the project was simply scrapped before it started. A few months after it was announced, the miniature Treo-connected notebook was shelved as the company opted to focus on “core devices.” Perhaps that one had a fighting chance, given the netbook craze that would spring to life a few months later. Though Palm, it seemed, was ultimately doomed in this post-iPhone world. But hey, now we have webOS on smart refrigerators, so win-win. Or hey, what about the Motorola Atrix or the Asus PadFone? Microsoft pushed a docking station with the Microsoft Lumia 950. And odds are pretty good you’ve just altogether forgotten the Celio Redfly. But history has not. They all seemed like fun and interesting devices on release, but all suffered similar fates. And in a time when we’re all backed up and synced to the cloud, it’s hard to say precisely what benefit we’d get from a docking station for a specific line of devices. But hey, it’s there if you need it. Godspeed, Samsung DeX. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Samsung Electronics Founded 1969 Overview Samsung Electronics is a South Korean multinational electronics company engaged in consumer electronics, information technology and mobile communications, and device solutions businesses worldwide.

Python ChinaThe Saga of a Sydney Academic Stuck in China Spotlights the Limits of Beijing’s Soft Power Smartphones Meet the Galaxy S8, Samsung's Most Important Phone Ever Lisa Eadicicco Mar 29, 2017 Samsung on Wednesday revealed two new flagship smartphones, a move the company hopes will help it recover from the financial and public relations debacle sparked by its problem-plagued Galaxy Note 7. Those devices, released last fall, were recalled shortly thereafter due to overheating batteries. The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, as the new phones are named, will go on sale April 21. The price will vary depending on the carrier: Verizon will sell the Galaxy S8 for $720 (or $30 per month) and the Galaxy S8+ for $840 (or $35 per month.) T-Mobile will be offering the Galaxy S8 for $750 (or $30 per month) while the larger model will cost $850 (or $30 per month). A new pair of flagship handsets is always a big deal for any smartphone maker. But the latest Galaxy models bear the extra burden of helping Samsung retain its spot atop the Android phone market after the Note 7 recall, as well as amid increasing competition from rivals like Apple, Google and Huawei. Apple is expected to introduce new iPhone models in September, Google launched its first truly self-made device last year to rave reviews, and Chinese manufacturers like Huawei and OnePlus are making inroads in the U.S. market and abroad. In an effort to prevent issues like those that affected the Note 7, both of Samsung's new phones have been built following the company's new battery protocol, which calls for an eight-point safety check. If that new quality control process works as planned, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ could succeed in reversing the company's misfortunes. Based on the time I spent with the phones during a media preview, both devices appeared to be promising contenders, thanks to new features like an impressive edge-to-edge screen, a new virtual assistant, and facial recognition technology. Related SmartphonesTake a Look at Apple's New Special Edition iPhone 7 Smartphones Take a Look at Apple's New Special Edition iPhone 7 Pick up one of the Samsung's new Galaxy devices and the first thing you'll notice is how big the screen looks. The Galaxy S8 features a 5.8-inch display, while the larger model boasts a 6.2-inch display, both of which are notably larger than the Galaxy S7's 5.1 inches and the Galaxy 7 Edge's 5.5 inches. Samsung here ditched the home button in favor of a touch sensor, allowing the screen to be embiggened without making the device physically larger. A slimmer profile, meanwhile, helps the devices feel more manageable to hold than their predecessors. On the software side, a simpler interface also makes the new phones easier to use — instead of an app launcher, users tap the bottom of the screen to view their app library. Samsung diehards will be happy to learn the Galaxy S8 and S8+ inherit fan-favorite features like dust and water resistance, a microSD card slot for expanding storage, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. (Samsung's doubling the default storage this time around, offering 64GB instead of 32GB.) The Galaxy S8 and S8+ also herald the arrival of Bixby, Samsung's new voice-activated assistant. The company is aiming to differentiate it from rival services like Apple's Siri by making it better at understanding situational context, as a human aide would. (Apple, Google, Amazon and other technology firms are also hard at work improving their digital aides in this way.) Samsung claims that Bixby can accomplish any task a user might otherwise do via taps and swipes, though it's unclear which third-party apps will work with it. Both devices have a dedicated button on their sides for summoning Bixby. And Bixby can use the phones' camera to scan items and retrieve information about them — one might, for example, get food pairing suggestions by scanning a bottle of wine. (Amazon's ill-fated Fire Phone also attempted to use its camera in a similar way.) Both the Galaxy S8 and S8+ boast facial recognition and eye-scanning technology allowing owners to unlock their phone by looking at it, the latter of which Samsung debuted on the Note 7. Photography-wise, the new devices show little improvement from the Galaxy S7, though the front-facing camera has been upped to 8 megapixels from 5 and has face-detecting autofocus. Samsung also claims the new phones have better image processing technology, which should help them take better photos in low light and reduce blur. Samsung is additionally pitching its new devices as multi-purpose computers. Both phones can control household gadgets compatible with the company's SmartThings platform and work with its DeX dock, which simulates the experience of using a desktop. When attached to this dock, the S8's interface looks like that of a computer rather than a smartphone. Apps optimized for the accessory run full-screen rather than in smaller windows, and the phone will work with enterprise software to run a virtual version of Windows. Microsoft announced a similar feature for its Lumia 950 phone in 2015 called Continuum. Still, it's unclear how much consumer demand exists for such a feature outside the workplace. Samsung's Galaxy S8 and S8+ face the formidable challenge of convincing buyers it's worth taking another chance on the company's smartphones after the Note 7 fiasco. To some degree, the company can bank on its brand, having long made some of the best Android handsets available. And based on my limited hands-on time and the spec sheet, these phones might just have what it takes to get Samsung back on track — provided there are no fiery surprises on the horizon.

But things are now changing, for the better. As first reported by VentureBeat, the Cupertino firm has began rejecting submissions that promote pricing like ”Free” in app titles/ icons and on App Store screenshots/previews. For the past month, Apple’s been rejecting submissions to App Store and Mac App Store when metadata includes pricing information. Here’s the warning message iTunes Connect puts up when a developer submits an app that mentions “free” in its title. Your app’s name, icons, screenshots, or previews to be displayed on the App Store include references to your app’s price, which is not considered a part of these metadata items. Please remove any references to your app’s price from your app’s name, including any references to your app being free or discounted. If you would like to advertise changes to your app’s price, it would be appropriate to include this information in the app description. Changes to your app’s price can be made in the Pricing and Availability section of iTunes Connect. An Apple spokesperson confirmed the changes. While some iPhone, iPad and Mac apps still use the word “free” in their names or on screenshots, future updates will have to stop doing so to avoid being rejected. I’ve always loathed “free” in app names. Apple prides itself for careful curating App Store content and this is definitely a step in the right direction, more so in light of the Great App Store Cleanup. As mentioned, Apple has previously discouraged developers from using pricing information in their titles and screenshots in the official developer guide for iTunes Connect and its overview of App Store product pages. “Don’t reference specific prices in your app screenshots,” Apple is advised, saying referencing a local currency can mislead customers in other store territories and cause confusion. “Also avoid including specific prices in your app description,” reads another passage on Apple’s website.

Ds So when are they going to force developers to actually list what they update or changed rather than “made improvements”. Like ok cool… but what did you actually do? Fanboy  I feel like developers only send out these (fake) updates to reset their ratings, AND every time they submit a new version they’re allowed to bug you with a “Rate this app” notification once. That’s why they send out these fake “updates”. Ds I’m sure that’s the reason but I was more so referring to Facebook. Since that is the one that comes to mind right away. They never outline how they improved the app. Chase Giles It’s because Facebook uses AB testing and releases. Both the new and old version of the app are on your phone, but they only enable the new features when they’re tested and ready to go. So if they did state what they changed people would be confused as they don’t have the feature they’re talking about. Erick Reyes They do that because they actually change code and fix bugs, but you (and maybe 99% of their user base) probably didn’t notice the bug, so why put it there? Ds Because that’s what the update section is for.

However, early impressions suggest the South Korean firm has blown all of its rivals away with its latest device. If you’re looking to purchase a new high-end handset, here’s why you should choose the Samsung Galaxy S8 over the iPhone 7. Design Apple’s biggest advantage over all of its competitors has traditionally been design, but that’s no longer the case.  The iPhone 4, launched way back in 2010, is to date the best-looking version of the iPhone. Being seven years old, it’s of course dated in every other way, but in terms of design alone, the iPhone 7, iPhone 6 and 6S and iPhone 5 and 5S can’t stand up to it.     At that time, design was Samsung’s weakest point, with the company’s flagships constantly let down by mediocre looks and questionable build materials. However, it closed the gap with the arrival of the Galaxy S6 in 2015 and has now surpassed its main rival. The Galaxy S8 makes the iPhone 7 look dull and dated. In fact, it puts every other phone on the market to shame, including the S7.  Samsung’s managed to marry beauty and practicality, squeezing a large screen onto a handset that’s compact enough for comfortable one-handed use. I’m sceptical about ‘bezel-less’ displays, due to issues with ergonomics and fragility, but the S8’s looks fantastic.  LG took largely the same approach with its new G6 flagship, but Samsung has simply managed to pull it off better. Samsung Galaxy S8 + show all Samsung Galaxy S8 1/10 2/10 3/10 4/10 5/10 6/10 7/10 8/10 9/10 10/10 Screen The iPhone 7’s display isn’t bad, it’s just that the Galaxy S8’s is far superior. I’m still not convinced that the curved edges serve much of a purpose beyond aesthetics, but Samsung’s phone trounces the iPhone in other areas.  The S8’s 5.8-inch screen is not only much larger than the iPhone 7’s 4.7-inch display, it’s also much sharper. The S8 offers an impressive 570 pixels per inch, while iPhone 7 users have to make do with 326 pixels per inch. This difference is particularly noticeable when it comes to viewing virtual reality content. VR is becoming increasingly popular amongst consumers, the vast majority of whom would understandably rather purchase a relatively cheap headset for a mobile device instead of an expensive system like the HTC Vive. While Samsung has embraced this, Apple is lagging some way behind. Expandable storage The fact that this is an old criticism of the iPhone doesn’t make it any less relevant. Apple never has and quite possibly never will equip the iPhone with a microSD card slot. The 32GB iPhone 7 costs £599, while the 128GB version costs £699 and the 256GB version costs £799. A high-quality 128GB microSD card, meanwhile, can be purchased for less than £40 on Amazon.  Apple’s decision to deprive the iPhone 7 of expandable storage is a deliberate one made with one aim in mind: to encourage consumers to part with more money for a model with more storage capacity.  The Galaxy S8, meanwhile, comes with 64GB of storage as standard, which is expandable by up to 256GB. Oh, and it also features a headphone jack. An iPhone 7 is displayed in a store in London, Britain October 4, 2016 (REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth) DeX DeX isn’t the S8’s most exciting feature, but it could prove really useful for business-focused users.  You can transform the phone into an Android-running desktop computer by hooking it up to a dock, monitor and keyboard. However, users can also access Windows 10 through a virtual desktop interface. The system looked slick enough to be taken seriously in demonstrations, booting up quickly and simultaneously running multiple applications - including 4K video - without suffering any lag. Samsung has talked up its apparent multitasking capabilities, and early impressions suggest it can walk the walk too.  A patent for a similar-looking Apple system was discovered recently, suggesting that the company could launch a version of DeX for the iPhone at some point in the future, but Samsung has beaten it to the punch. Bixby  Siri has been around for a long time now, but beyond setting reminders and providing silly answers to silly questions, it’s been quite the disappointment. Amazon’s Alexa has quickly established itself as the world’s favourite AI assistant, and Samsung has revealed ambitious aims with Bixby.

It will initially only work with a handful of apps, but Samsung says it will support almost every task the apps are capable of performing, entirely through spoken commands. The company intends to make all of its internet-connected appliances, such as washing machines and fridges, Bixby-compatible too.  “As the Bixby ecosystem grows, we believe Bixby will evolve from a smartphone interface to an interface for your life,” said Injong Rhee, the executive vice president and head of R&D at Samsung software and services.  More about: Samsung samsung galaxy s8 iPhone 7 Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

By Alistair Charlton Updated March 29, 2017 19:29 BST The Samsung Galaxy S8 has a 5.8in 'Infinity Display' and narrow bezelsIBTimes UK Here it is. After the calamitous and explosive Galaxy Note 7 own-goal, Samsung is back and it has a point to prove - that it can bounce be best once more. If the Note 7 launch had gone well then Samsung, seeing Apple stick with an unchanged design for the iPhone 7, could likely have got away with an incremental update with the S8. But today that wouldn't have cut it. So what we have instead is an all-new design. It still carries over Samsung's recognisable house style, but it makes more changes than we have seen since the S5 evolved into the S6 back in 2015. The screen is taller, the physical home button has disappeared, the fingerprint sensor has moved to the back, a new 'Bixby button' has sprouted out of the left-hand side, and there's more polished metal than ever before. Galaxy S8 size and display In photographs the Galaxy S8 and its larger sibling the S8 Plus (stylised by Samsung as S8+) look awkwardly long and perhaps even uncomfortable to hold. But in the hand this simply isn't the case. The screens now have an aspect ratio of 18.5:9 instead of 16:9, making them longer but no wider than the previous generation. But because the bezels at the top and bottom have been slimmed down, the regular S8 is smaller than the S7 Edge from last year. The new screens measure in at 5.8in and 6.2in on the S8 and S8 Plus respectively, compared to 5.1in and 5.5in on the S7 and S7 Edge. Their resolution takes a small jump up from 2560 x 1440 to 2960 x 1440. All this means more space and more pixels, but in a phone no larger than the one you already own. And unlike last year, both models now feature a display which curves down over the left and right edges of the handset. Samsung calls its screens Infinity Display, taking inspiration from infinity swimming pools and their cascading edges. Samsung has given the S8 a glass front and back, with a chrome chassis sandwiched in-betweenIBTimes UK Both S8 phones are beautiful, both to the eye and in the hand. Samsung might have had its fingers literally burned with the Note 7's exploding battery fiasco, but no one criticised the phone for being ugly and the company clearly hasn't forgotten how to design a great looking gadget in the interim. The S8 duo have glass on their front and back, sandwiching a metal chassis which has a polished chrome look for the first time (ignoring the chrome-painted and easily chipped plastic of the S5). The S8 feel more robust than that, but we suspect they are likely to scratch with all but the most delicate use. By elongating the display, Samsung has forced its physical home button out of town, replacing it with an on-screen alternative which provides a satisfying haptic click when pressed. As with the iPhone 7 there is no physical movement here when you press down, but the tap sent to your thumb is enough to convince your brain a button is being pressed. Although the digital home button isn't always on-screen, that area of the display always reacts in the same way when pressed, no matter what you're doing. Kicking the physical button to the curb also means the fingerprint sensor has had to find a new home. It now resides on the back of the handset, to the side of the camera and where it falls neatly within reach of your index finger. A USB-C port sits on the bottom edge and next to, perhaps surprisingly...a headphone jack. The Galaxy S8 will launch in the UK with three colour options: black, grey and silverIBTimes UK The Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus will be available in the UK in Midnight Black, Orchid Grey and Artic Silver. The first is very similar to Apple's Jet Black on the iPhone 7, giving the S8 a stealthy look, while Orchid Grey is almost pale blue in some light and Artic Silver is, well, silver. Some markets will get the S8 in blue and gold at launch, and we suspect these will come to the UK later in the year. Samsung Galaxy S8 camera As for cameras, the S8 has the same 12-megapixel rear sensor as the S7, but with what Samsung calls 'multi frame image processing'. This means in tricky lighting conditions the camera takes three photos instead of just one, picks the best, then uses the other two to enhance it, boosting contrast and sharpness. The front camera has an 8MP sensor with faster autofocus than the S7 and improved facial recognition. That last point is handy, as the S8 can be unlocked by looking at it - either with facial recognition, or with the same iris sensor found in the Note 7. Alternatively you can use a PIN, password or your fingerprint, just as before. Storage is 64GB as standard and both phones have a microSD card slot for adding up to 256GB more. Both also have an IP68 water and dust resistance rating, and wireless charging. Galaxy S8 and its 5.8in screen (left) next to the 5.5in Galaxy S7 Edge (centre) and 6.2in Galaxy S8 Plus (right)IBTimes UK Galaxy S8, a personal assistant A we mentioned earlier, the S8 duo have a new button for summoning Bixby, Samsung's new personal assistant. Naturally, the company says Bixby is "more than just an app or a voice assistant", but really that's exactly what it is. To Samsung's credit, it has taken a slightly different approach to Apple and Siri on the iPhone. Bixby understands what you are looking at and reacts accordingly. Say you are looking at an image in the Gallery app and want to make it your wallpaper; press the Bixby button and say 'set this photo as my wallpaper' and Bixby will do exactly that. Saying 'show this on the TV' will send the image to your Samsung TV (if connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the phone). Bixby can be interacted with via voice or text input, and is described by Samsung as "a total platform", not just an app. It works with 10 apps pre-installed on the Galaxy S8 and developers are encouraged to incorporate Bixby into their own apps. So in the near future expect to say 'save this photo' when looking at an image in a Facebook message and it will do exactly that. Such is the size of the S8 Plus' screen, you can watch a video while replying to text messagesIBTimes UK Another aspect of Samsung's assistant is called Bixby Vision. Open the camera, tap the Bixby icon and take a photo of a landmark, monument or a product you'd like to buy and Bixby will search online for relevant information. Snap a photo of the Shard skyscraper in London and Bixby will serve up opening times, contact information and details on nearby bars, restaurants and the like. Photograph a bottle of wine and ask Bixby to look it up online, and you will be given the option to buy it. Useful for finding a deal on the wine you're drinking in a restaurant. Bixby will understand Korean at launch, American English one month later, and will have more languages coming later in 2017. It also appears as a Google Now-style page next to the home screen for displaying news, calendar events and other useful information. Galaxy S8, a smart home controller Next up is Samsung Connect, a new application for controlling smart home appliances and gadgets with the Galaxy S8. Just like Apple's Home app on the iPhone, Samsung Connect can be used to control compatible light bulbs (from Philips Hue, for example) and Samsung's smart fridges, robot vacuum cleaners and more. Appliances can be ordered by location (home, office, bedroom, kitchen, etc) and modes can be set up - such as one which switches all but one light off when you go out, for example. A neat trick when connected to Samsung's FamilyHub fridge is how you can see a live video feed of the inside of your fridge on the phone, from anywhere in the world - perfect for forgetful shoppers. Bixby integration with Samsung Connect, letting you adjust lights with your voice, will come at a later date. Galaxy S8, a desktop computer Lastly, the Galaxy S8 is the first phone to support Samsung DeX, which essentially turns it into a desktop computer. Sit the S8 in the DeX dock (sold separately), connect this to a monitor with an HDMI cable, pair a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard to the phone, and a desktop version of Android fills the monitor. There is a PC-style desktop and toolbar, multiple apps can be opened and interacted with at once, their windows can be adjusted however you like, and the phone can even play Ultra HD 4K content from the likes of YouTube, Amazon Prime and Netflix, if your monitor supports it. The S8's fingerprint sensor is now on the back, to the right of the 12-megapixel cameraIBTimes UK Cooling fans built into the dock prevent the phone from overheating and a USB-C port keeps the battery topped up while you work. The dock also has two regular USB-A ports, Ethernet and the aforementioned HDMI. Samsung Galaxy S8 UK price and release date: Samsung says the S8 and S8 Plus will be available in-store across the UK and Europe from 28 April. The S8 costs £689 SIM-free and the S8 Plus is £779; both come with 64GB of storage. Pre-orders open today (29 March) and if you order by 19 April then your S8 will arrive "up to eight days early", says Samsung. Samsung needs the S8 to be a success and so far it looks on course to deliver a truly exceptional pair of smartphones. The S8 has a massive screen without expanding its footprint beyond that of the S7 Edge, while the S8 Plus has finally made a 6in phone possible without looking more like a tablet. Samsung stumbled in 2016, but now it is back on its feet and ready to fight.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Moe Slah iPhone 8 may feature a revolutionary new 3D sensing camera Yoni Heisler @edibleapple March 28th, 2017 at 7:44 PM Share Tweet Apple has yet to begin iPhone 8 production, but some of the latest reports emanating from the rumor mill suggest that Apple’s next-gen iPhone will be even more compelling than we initially imagined. While it’s more or less a given that the iPhone 8 will sport an edgeless OLED display, we’re now starting to see mounting evidence that the device will also feature a revolutionary new 3D camera. Word of Apple’s interest in incorporating a 3D camera onto the iPhone 8 first emerged this past February via a research note from reputed analyst Ming Chi-Kuo of KGI Securities. Kuo relayed that the camera module on Apple’s next-gen iPhone will utilize 3D sensing technology from PrimeSense, an Israeli company Apple purchased a few years ago. PrimeSense, remember, supplied the technology that Microsoft used on its first-gen version of Kinect. Not mincing words, Kuo boldly stated that the iPhone 8 camera could very well “reinvent the user experience.” Don't Miss: Galaxy S8: Specs, release info, and everything else we know right now Bolstering Kuo’s report, Morgan Stanley analyst Charlie Chan is out with a new research note (via Barrons) arguing that Himax Technologies has seen its share price rise appreciably this year because of a deal it struck with Apple to provide 3D sensing components for the iPhone 8. As to why Himax Technologies is a good fit for Apple, Chan writes: There are already 3D sensing technologies based on PC/tablet that can run: (1) face recognition, (2) gesture sensing, (3) 3D modeling, and (4) photo shooting enhancement… We think 3D modeling has the greatest potential, because it can be developed to new AR/VR applications (gaming, virtual social networks, etc.). Today, Intel’s RealSense 3D camera has enabled 3D sensing in PC/tablet platforms. Himax’s wafer level optics (WLO) technology can further reduce the size and fit the 3D sensing in smartphones. Indeed, if there’s one thing Apple can’t get enough of, it’s increasingly compact and miniaturized components. With a 3D camera in tow, it’s believed that Apple will introduce a number of advanced facial recognition and augmented reality features into the iPhone 8 user experience. In addition to being able to take 3D selfies, there is also speculation that Apple’s camera technology will allow users to place a 3D version of their head on a video game character’s body. Coupled with a radical new redesign years in the making, the iPhone 8’s rumored $1,000 pricepoint is starting to make a lot more sense.

Here’s how   1 by Julie Cazzin March 28th, 2017 Online only.   1 Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Share LinkedIn Email Jared Ali AGE: 38 PLACE: Calgary TFSA TOTAL: $91,753.63 STRATEGY: Warren Buffet’s classic value style Me and my TFSA Jared Ali, a graphic designer in Calgary, is the first to admit he started investing in his TFSA rather late—2011 to be exact. That’s when his dad let him in on the great tax benefits of investing in a TFSA. “I didn’t understand its value as an investment vehicle for quite a while,” says Ali. “I had been investing in RRSPs for years but once my dad explained the tax benefits of TFSAs—that money invested in them can grow tax-free for life—I realized it was a no-brainer and opened one right away.” Ten TFSA questions answered » Right now, Jared has a self-directed TFSA worth an impressive $91,753.63 and for the last six years he’s had one strategy: copy Warren Buffett. “I wanted to find things that were undervalued and follow Buffett’s classic value style of investing. It’s worked for me as I’ve almost doubled my money in six years.” In fact, Jared invests by one of Buffett’s most popular mottos: “Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy only when others are fearful.” But Jared also likes the fact that Buffett favours investing in what he understands. “I remember this one particular story where Buffett was at a a Dairy Queen with his grandkids. Of course, everyone eats Dairy Queen ice-cream so he invested in the company. He also saw his grandkids and their friends with Apple iPhones so he invested in Apple. I think what I like best is the the way he takes into account the emotions of the consumer. That intrigues me.” Parking cash in a TFSA may hurt investors » Following Buffett’s lead, Jared’s himself bought Apple shares—10 to be exact—in April 2012 for $590 each, adjusted for the exchange rate and trading fees. He bought more Apple shares in 2013 and 2014, raising his position to 30 shares. (After a 7-for-1 stock split on June 2014 he held 210 shares). In October of that same year, he sold 105 shares for US$105, netting $12,215 total when converted back to Canadian dollars. “I still have 105 Apple shares in my TFSA today and plan to hold those indefinitely,” he says. Have a TFSA strategy to share? Click here to email us » For the last couple of years, Jared has focused his stock buying on what he believes to be undervalued oil and gas stocks. “I started buying Crescent Point Energy, Talisman Energy (before it was bought out by Repsol SA in early 2015) and Calfrac Well Services when oil was trading at around US$45 a barrel and dollar cost averaged several share purchases. I still hold shares in Calfrac and Crescent Point today,” he says. Why your TFSA needs a successor holder » He also bought 125 shares of Bristol Myers Squibb, a pharmaceutical company, last summer for US$60 a share after Opdivo, a promising cancer drug, failed in a key study as the company attempted to extend it’s usage for lung cancer patients. “It immediately fell US$10 a share after that announcement and I immediately bought 125 shares,” says Jared. “I invested US$7,509 at that time and it’s worth about the same today.” His last major holding is 138 shares in Icahn Enterprises, an American conglomerate. “It’s a multi-limited partnership and has a dividend yield of over 11%,” says Jared. Jared’s dream with his TFSA? “To buy a Ferrari. If I get my TFSA to $1 million, my wife may allow me to that. She’s the responsible one in the family, but I think I have a lot more fun.” JARED’S TFSA HOLDINGS CANADIAN HOLDINGS VALUE Calfrac Well Services $9,575.00 Crescent Point Energy $25,353.60 TD Investment Savings Account $17,449.00 Cash $34.19 Sub-total $52,411.79 U.S. HOLDINGS VALUE Apple $14,677.95 Bristol Myers Squibb 7,147.50 Icahn Enterprise 7,657.62 Cash 546.58 Sub-total $30,029.65 Total Portfolio Value* $91,753.63 * U.S. stock values were converted into Canadian dollars (exchange rate $1.31) How much room do you have in your TFSA?

Users who have updated to iOS 10.3, released Monday, were impressed to see the update actually freed up storage space on their smartphones. After downloading and installing iOS 10.3, some reported freeing up anywhere from two to five gigabytes of storage on their iPhone.

That's amazing!!!!!! — Jonny (@jonnymmxvi) March 28, 2017 Looks like the new iOS version (10.3) does give you a bit of extra space. pic.twitter.com/8kzEN9TiwH — Ben Miller (@notbenmiller) March 29, 2017 This so-called “storage miracle” is thanks to a new file system on iOS 10.3 called Apple File System (APFS). Without getting too technical, the new file system changes the way data is stored on your devices, which means your phone should operate faster and you should have some more storage space. It also offers better encryption and security features. The extra space was welcome news to users who had experienced frustration with older versions of Apple’s iOS operating system being too big to download. In fact, Apple was sued in 2015 for making the iOS 8 upgrade too big, initially requiring users to have at least 5.7GB of free space in order for it to be installed. Updated iOS 10.3 and now I have 2.3 GB extra storage! Has to be first update that freed up space instead of taking it. — Namrata (@_Namrataa) March 28, 2017 However, according to user reports, the iOS 10.3 update takes longer to install than most updates. To download iOS 10.3, unlock your device and tap on “Settings,” then “General.” Next, tap on “Software Update” and the iOS 10.3 update should automatically appear. Then tap “Download and Install.” READ MORE: Update to iOS 10.1 immediately to protect your iPhone from a nasty security flaw Apple recommends that you back up your device before installing new software to ensure you don’t lose any data. If you have photos or data that you don’t want to risk losing, you should back up your phone to iCloud or plug it into a computer with iTunes before installing the update. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Lee Mar 29, 2017, 10:40am EDT Presented by tweet share The new Galaxy S8. The Verge Where technology and economics collide Today’s release of the Samsung Galaxy S8 today is highly anticipated, but it should also be fairly routine, as Samsung has released seven previous models of the flagship Galaxy S smartphone line. But these are not ordinary circumstances. Samsung is still recovering after exploding Galaxy Note 7 phones damaged Samsung’s brand last fall. And the company is facing growing competition both from the high end of the market — especially Google’s well-reviewed Pixel phone — and from dirt-cheap Chinese phone makers. So the launch of the S8 is a fairly high-stakes moment for Samsung. It’s the company’s best chance this year to change the conversation away from exploding batteries and shore up its status as the top Android smartphone maker. But it’s not going to be easy. Samsung’s rise to the top of the smartphone heap was aided by the fact that Samsung often had the fastest chips, highest-resolution screens, and widest range of high-quality hardware. But as the market matures and competition intensifies, the hardware advantage is becoming less of an edge. Power and profits increasingly lie with companies like Apple, Facebook, and Google that make smartphone software and services. Samsung has traditionally struggled to create software that sets its phones apart from generic Android devices. Today, Samsung is hoping to change that by introducing Bixby, a voice assistant that will compete directly with Apple’s Siri, Google Assistant, and Amazon’s Alexa. We won’t know if Bixby is a compelling product until reviewers and customers have a chance to try it for themselves. But history suggests reason for skepticism. Samsung has a decentralized corporate structure that’s great at churning out cheap, high-quality hardware. But that structure makes it difficult for Samsung to make the kind of long-term, company-wide investments required to produce a successful software platform. Why Samsung struggles with software Rick Kern/Getty Images for Samsung Samsung has subsidiaries that produce a variety of different components, such as batteries, screens, and memory chips. Samsung gives its various business units a lot of autonomy and judges them by their financial performance. Samsung’s smartphone division combines parts from other Samsung business units to make a finished product. At any given point in time, Samsung has many different teams designing a bunch of different smartphone models in parallel, in an effort to serve many different market niches at the same time. This structure makes Samsung very good at quickly bringing high-quality smartphones. But it becomes something of a liability any time Samsung tries to build new software platforms, a situation illustrated by this insightful December 2015 article by Reuters reporters Jeremy Wagstaff and Se Young Lee. “Interviews with former and serving employees paint a picture of confusion and overlap between competing divisions, where the short-term interests of promoting hardware trump long-term efforts to build platforms that would add value for customers and increase their loyalty to the brand,” the pair wrote. “One said he only learned from someone outside the company that the hands-free app his team was updating for the upcoming Galaxy S4 launch had competition — from inside Samsung.” The manager became frustrated the software was seen “as little more than a marketing tool” within Samsung. This stands in stark contrast to a more monolithic company like Apple. When Apple decides to introduce a new smartphone service like Siri or Apple Pay, the entire company mobilizes to support the new standard. Inside the company, everyone knows the new software will soon be installed on tens of millions of iPhones, so they spare no effort to make it as good as possible. Outside the company, everyone knows the software will soon be installed on tens of millions of iPhones, so they’re more willing to sign up for complementary services — like merchants signing up to accept Apple Pay payments. Samsung seems to realize that it has a problem and is trying to correct for it. The company has gotten better at creating company-wide standards that will be supported by all of its devices. A report last year found that the Samsung Pay payment service was behind Apple Pay but was attracting a significant number of customers. And while Bixby will be introduced on the Galaxy S8, Samsung is positioning it as a service that will be available on a wide range of Samsung devices, improving its chances of building a substantial base of users. Still, Samsung’s Bixby announcement last week didn’t exactly give the impression that the company is about to raise the bar for voice assistant quality. For example, Samsung claims that “most agents require users to state the exact commands in a set of fixed forms.” The problem with this is that leading voice assistants like Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa already do a pretty good job of interpreting natural language commands. The big challenge for Samsung is that creating software that’s almost as good as the software that ships with the standard version of Android is basically worthless, since customers would rather just get the standard Android service. To achieve a durable competitive advantage, Samsung needs to develop software and services that are actually better than what you can get from Apple and Google. But that will require mobilizing significant financial resources behind a project and sustaining the investment over many years. Samsung has never been good at this kind of coordinated effort. And having the company’s leader facing bribery charges isn’t going to make things any easier. So I’m not expecting Bixby to surpass Siri any time soon. Was this article helpful?

By Emily Bary March 28, 2017 6:32 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large The next iPhone won’t come out til September, but investors are already looking well beyond the new phone. Photo: Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Apple shares keep going up in anticipation of the iPhone 8 launch later this year, but for the most part Wall Street is already looking at what comes next, after the September iPhone launch. More from Barron’s Next Why Chipotle Might Raise Prices Viacom: Why Barron’s Sees The Stock Jumping 40% When to Buy Airline Tickets to Get The Cheapest Fare While UBS analyst Steven Milunovich currently sees limited upside for Apple in the next year -- the stock may rise perhaps 5% from its current $144 -- he sees more potential over the long term. In his view, Apple shares could realistically hit $175 in the next two to three years (a 22% rise). But he says $200 (a 39% jump) is possible if products besides the iPhone really take off. Here’s what it would take for Apple’s stock price to hit $200 by 2019, according to Milunovich. • This fall’s iPhone 8 ushers in a “supercycle” of phone upgrades, and investors feel confident that next fall’s lineup will also be strong. • Apple’s “other hardware” business, consisting of products like the Apple Watch and AirPods, starts seeing “strong growth” of 20% next fiscal year. Right now, investors are primarily focused on quarterly iPhone sales and the potential of Apple’s “services” business. The company would have to show that its wearables have mass appeal and that the overall Apple ecosystem is “more sticky” than investors originally thought. • The company’s price-to-earnings ratio rises from 14 currently to 16 -- or even higher, starting next year. If investors have more confidence in Apple’s potential going forward, they’ll likely pay more for every dollar the company earns. Were Apple to enter a completely new category, such as transportation, Milunovich says investors might “believe Apple has caught the next major trend and see a decent runway for growth,” pushing Apple’s price-to-earnings ratio above 17 times two years from now. • Apple buys back more of its stock. That reduces the number of shares outstanding, meaning that the company’s per-share profits increase. Big Picture: For the company’s shares to head significantly higher, Apple will have to show investors that it has more than just a few iPhone launches in store.

But it appears Trump has switched (at least for now) to a new iPhone — a device he previously threatened to boycott in the months before Election Day. From the campaign trail to the Oval Office, reporters have kept a close eye on the tweets coming from the @realDonaldTrump account, and not just for their news value: The belief was that tweets coming from Trump’s Android device reflect that they had been written by him, as opposed to his White House aides. In recent days, though, Trump’s tweets have primarily come from an iPhone. And that’s because, in the words of Dan Scavino, the president’s director of social media, the president has a new smartphone. .@POTUS @realDonaldTrump has been using his new iPhone for the past couple of weeks here on Twitter. Yes, it is #POTUS45 reading & tweeting!— Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) March 29, 2017 Contrast that with Trump’s harsh criticism of Apple in 2016 as the company battled the FBI, which tried to compel the iPhone maker to break its own security features. At the time, investigators sought to access data on a password-protected iPhone tied to the San Bernardino terrorist attack, but Apple resisted, arguing it would set a dangerous precedent that jeopardized all smartphone users’ privacy and security. Trump made his views clear: “Apple ought to give the security for that phone,” he said at a February 2016 campaign stop in South Carolina. “What I think you ought to do is boycott Apple until such a time as they give that security number. How do you like that? I just thought of it. Boycott Apple.” Boycott all Apple products until such time as Apple gives cellphone info to authorities regarding radical Islamic terrorist couple from Cal— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2016 Early on, Trump and Apple had something of a rocky relationship. The company withdrew from backing the 2016 Republican convention in Cleveland that officially selected Trump as the party’s presidential candidate, sources previously told me, and CEO Tim Cook later raised money for Democratic contender Hillary Clinton. But the two sides have tried to mend their relationship in recent months. Cook has connected with the Trump administration and its top aides, including Jared Kushner, at a dinner in Washington in January 2017. And he joined the president before his inauguration for the so-called “tech summit” at Trump Tower.

It has already hit the equivalent of $1,000/share when you factor in the share split. MarketWatch notes that the stock yesterday set two records: its highest ever value, at $143.80, and its highest intraday price of $142.80. Many analysts are setting high target prices for the stock, and one of them even predicts a possible $200 level, notes Business Insider – though he does add some crucial riders … Anker braided Lightning cables “For Apple to hit $200, iPhone needs to continue to grow beyond financial year 2018, new product categories must be established, and buybacks should exceed $50bn per year, boosting the P/E to 17x,” UBS analyst Steven Milunovich wrote in a note distributed to clients on Tuesday.  That ‘new product categories’ catch is, of course, a huge one – but Milunovich is allowing Apple a couple of years to get there as he sees the company moving through three phases. First comes the “super cycle” later this year, as a redesigned iPhone spurs a bunch of user upgrades, then it shifts to a “sustainable growth phase,” as Apple’s services business throws off reliable annual revenue, and finally, in 2019 and beyond, Apple will move into an “innovation phase” as it chases the next big thing.  While he admits this is an optimistic price, he does believe $175 is realistic. Milunovich said his most-likely scenario would be for the stock to hit $175, which is 21% above current levels. That would require earnings continuing to rise, “but at a slowing rate,” as iPhone sales stop growing, new products have just moderate success and margins turn flat. He does, though, have a third, pessimistic scenario in which the stock value could fall. He also envisions a third scenario, in which the stock falls to $125, which is 14% below current levels. In that world, iPhone sales turn negative and material innovation proves difficult. So, AAPL will either rocket in value, climb well or fall. Got it. But while UBS may be an outlier, a roundup of 47 analysts by Yahoo Finance shows just one rating the stock a sell, ten rating it a hold and 36 calling it either a buy or strong buy.

Apple Now Rejects Apps With Names That Include Price Information Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Apple Now Rejects Apps With Names That Include Price Information March 29, 2017 9:39 am EDT By Ashlee Kieler@akieler app store barring prices Change your name finding the cost elsewhere Free free free price what's in a name? Putting the price in the name of an item is just one way companies try to lure in potential customers, but app developers making their products available in Apple’s App Store will no longer have that option: The tech giant has begun barring developers from promoting the price of their apps in names or screenshots. VentureBeat reports that Apple’s iTunes Connect service, which reviews apps before they appear in the App Store, has blocked submissions that include price information in names for at least a month. While Apple has long discouraged the use of pricing information in metadata for app — names and descriptions — this marks the first time the company has outright rejected developers for using such ploys. What’s this mean? If a developer submits an app named, for example “Find Cute Kittens — Free Locator,” the creator could receive a rejection letter asking them to remove mentions of price from names and suggestions on where to include that information elsewhere. According to VentureBeat the full rejection letter reads: “Your app’s name, icons, screenshots, or previews to be displayed on the App Store include references to your app’s price, which is not considered a part of these metadata items. Please remove any references to your app’s price from your app’s name, including any references to your app being free or discounted. If you would like to advertise changes to your app’s price, it would be appropriate to include this information in the app description. Changes to your app’s price can be made in the Pricing and Availability section of iTunes Connect.” A spokesperson for Apple confirmed the change, but did not provide additional details, including if the change would apply to apps currently offered in the App Store.

Apple has already launched an updated version of the 9.7 inch iPad, and analyst reports suggest two other new iPads will launch in 2017, including one with a screen size we haven't yet seen in the iPad family. The first new iPad was announced just last week, a more affordable version of the 9.7-inch iPad. It's cheaper and offers more features than the older iPad Air 2 that it replaces, and doesn't cost as much as the more powerful 9.7-inch iPad Pro. That means two new iPads are still expected, and those are the Pro models you'll want to hold out for. The two new devices reportedly include a refresh of Apple's 12.9-inch iPad Pro, likely with a new processor but perhaps with industrial design changes, too. Apple is also reportedly gearing up to launch a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro. That's not just a new "Pro" model, but an entirely new size. You should hold off on buying new models for two big reasons. The first is the obvious: You don't want to spend money on a gadget that's about to replaced. Secondly, Apple typically drops the prices of its older models as it releases a new version, which means you'll save money even if you don't buy the updated iPad Pro 12.9 or iPad Pro 10.5. If you own an iPad Pro and are interested in buying one of the new models, this is the best time to put yours up for sale. Most folks probably don't know a refresh is so imminent, so you'll get more bang for your buck. So, when can you buy one of these? Here's the bad news. It's not really clear when Apple is going to launch the new 12.9-inch iPad Pro and 10.5-inch iPad. Reports out of Apple's supply chain correctly predicted that the new 9.7-inch iPad, announced last week, would launch during the first quarter of this year. Those reports pointed to a May or June announcement for the two other models. If so, you'll be rewarded with Apple's best new tablets if you can wait just another month or two.

Stock Hits Another Record High: How Much Further Can AAPL Run? At least one analyst predicts a rise to $200 per share By ValueWalk  |  Mar 29, 2017, 9:08 am EDT Get AAPL alerts: Submit     Popular Posts: Tesla Inc (TSLA) Model Y Rumors Excite Morgan Stanley Apple Inc.

Stock Hits Another Record High: How Much Further Can AAPL Run? Here’s Why Lululemon Athletica Inc. Stock (LULU) Could Drop 20% Snap Inc Stock (SNAP) and The Running Of The Bulls View All Posts This year has been tremendously kind to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock as it sets new records almost on a weekly basis of late. Tuesday’s record high was at $143.22 as the shares rose by nearly 2% following another bullish report. One analyst sees a clear path to at least $175 per share for Apple stock over the next few years. By early afternoon, the stock was on track for its fifth record close this month. Of course, Apple’s rise begs the question: is it too late to buy Apple stock? UBS AG analyst Steven Milunovich reiterated his Buy rating and $151 price target for the stock in a research note dated $151 as he proclaimed $200 as a possible two- to three-year target. However, he feels that $175 is the more likely target in this time frame. He noted that Apple stock has risen 15% since the company’s last earnings report, so investors have been wondering whether the upside has dried up yet. He reassures them that there is probably still upside for those willing to buy and hold for at least the next two to three years. 9 Stocks to Buy That Are Growing Faster Than Amazon However, he adds that in an ultra-bearish scenario involving “iPhone maturation, lack of new products, and margin pressure,” there could be downside to $125 if the stock’s PE multiple falls to 12 times. Three Phases for Apple Stock Milunovich broke down what he sees as the three main phases for Apple, which are Supercycle (a.k.a., the iPhone 8), Sustainable Growth and Innovation. He subscribes to the Supercycle thesis which is prevalent on Wall Street right now, although a few have started to warn investors to tread carefully. According to Milunovich, the Supercycle phase will last through fiscal 2019, and then in the nine months after that, the company will move into the Sustainable Growth phase, in which the focus will move from the iPhone 8 to whether the company can keep and monetize its installed base and “deliver annuity-like growth.” He feels the Innovation phase could arrive in fiscal 2019 as investors try to figure out if the company will win the next stage of technology. Can Apple Stock Reach $200 Per Share? The analyst feels that the most likely scenario is for Apple stock to maintain a multiple of 14 times, rising as earnings rise although at a decelerating rate. Then when the iPhone stops growing, he predicts “moderate” success for new products and “flattish” margins. He explained that in order for Apple stock to reach $200, the iPhone must keep growing past fiscal 2018 and new product categories must be added. He also believes that share repurchases must exceed $500 billion annually, thus raising the P/E multiple to 17 times. 7 Future Blue-Chip Stocks You Need to Buy On the other hand, if the iPhone turns negative and it becomes hard for the company to offer any “material” innovation, he sees possible downside to $125. This will be an important year, as if the company disappoints with the iPhone 8, investors will probably punish its stock severely. The post Apple Inc.

According to Hall, Wall Street has underestimated the coming iPhone “super cycle.” BGR reports that Hall thinks that if the iPhone 8 is a compelling device that the upgrade cycle could be the biggest upgrade yet for Apple. “We believe that Street numbers still fail to capture the size of the likely replacement cycle assuming Apple delivers a compelling product this year,” wrote Hall in a note for investors. Hall thinks that Apple could sell as many as 260 million iPhones in 2017, a huge increase compared to the 211 million iPhones that Apple sold in 2016. Hall also goes on to add his opinions on what the iPhone 8, or iPhone Pro as he calls it, will have for a feature set. Hall is predicting a price tag of over $1000. He figures that Apple plans to try and control demand by pricing the smartphone higher than in the past. Despite that big price tag, the analyst thinks that Apple’s new iPhone Pro will account for 41% of iPhone sales for Q4 2017. Hall expects to see the edge-to-edge OLED screen that has been rumored for a long time now. He also predicts a main camera that will allow refocusing of the image after it is taken called a “structured-light-augmented” main camera. The front camera is expected to have 3D facial recognition and 3D camera effects. Interestingly Hall says that the iPhone Pro might lack a fingerprint sensor, but he thinks that is unlikely. Hall also gives his two cents on the size of the iPhone Pro, he says that the 5.85-inch iPhone will be the same physical size as a 5.5-inch iPhone. Hall says Apple considered making a 5.1-inch iPhone the same size as the 4.7-inch device but decided against the device. Both the iPhone Pro and the iPhone 7S are tipped to feature front and back glass and wireless charging. iPhone 7s models are said to get camera upgrades.

The launch in Taiwan means that Apple Pay is now available in a total of 15 global markets — the US, UK, Canada, Australia, China, Singapore, Switzerland, France, Hong Kong, Russia, New Zealand, Japan, Spain and Ireland, with a planned launch in Italy expected “soon”. Both Samsung Pay and Android Pay are also gearing up to launch in Taiwan. A total of 46 retailers are listed as supporting Apple Pay for in-store payments on Apple’s Taiwan website, including Carrefour, Big City, Breeze, City Super, FamilyMart, Starbucks, Watsons and Far Eastern Department Stores. Only those with Taishin International Bank cards will be able to make payments using Apple Pay in FamilyMart locations however, according to The China Post, with the retailer opening up the service to CTBC Bank, Cathay United Bank and E Sun Bank customers in July. The service is available on iPhone 6 handsets and above, iPhone SE, iPad Pro, iPad (5th generation), iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 3 and above, along with the Apple Watch. Apple revealed in February 2016 that it would be launching Apple Pay in Taiwan, when CEO Tim Cook announced that the mobile payment service tripled its user base in 2016, with transaction volume up 500% year-over-year. Seven banks in Taiwan were granted permission by the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) to support Apple Pay earlier this month. Standard Chartered Bank was not on the list of approved banks at the time, while First Commercial Bank — which does not appear on the list of announced supporting banks — did receive approval.

By Corazon Victorino On 03/29/17 AT 9:24 AM Close Apple just launched iOS 10.3 to the public, but it is now hard at work in beta testing the next major update for iOS-running device. With the release of the first iOS 10.3.2 beta comes a new discovery pointing to the possibility that Samsung’s biggest rival could be terminating support for older iPhones and iPads.  On Tuesday, MacRumors reported that the Cupertino giant seeded the first pre-release version of iOS 10.3.2 to developers via the Apple Developer Center. Since the software’s new, the Apple-centric news site noted that its features and whatever improvements it brings were still unknown by the time its report was published. The news site also indicated that because iOS 10.3 is a major update, the next one could focus on bug fixes and under-the-hood performance enhancements.  Apparently, there is now information on what the next iOS update brings, and it’s not good news to owners of iPhone 5, iPhone 5c and the fourth-generation iPad. Based on what Apple Insider found out about iOS 10.3.2 beta, the point update will likely cut support for 32-bit devices or those launched in 2012 and 2013.  The proof that Apple could be ending support to older devices is found on the developer downloads webpage, which now shows that iOS 10.3.2 beta only contains restore images for 64-bit devices. Apple Insider claims that the absence of restore images for 32-bit devices strongly suggests that the Cupertino giant could be dropping support for older hardware architectures.  The Apple Post reports that the devices that could be directly affected by this move are the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c and the fourth-generation iPad. The three were included in the devices that received the iOS 10.3 update, but that could be the final update for them since they are housing processors built on 32-bit architecture.  It seems the iPhone 5s will not be affected by this disappointing move, since the device launched with the A7 system-on-chip. It was also the Apple smartphone that marked the end for 32-bit hardware. The year after the iPhone 5s launched in 2013, Apple started pushing developers toward 64-bit architecture. In 2015, the company became more serious in moving forward with 64-bit technology for both iOS hardware and apps.  A recent discovery by developers point to the possibility that Apple could be ending support to its older iOS devices.

According to a report from VentureBeat, Apple has begun rejecting applications with pricing information in its name, icons, screenshots, or previews. Apple has reportedly begun this practice over the past month or so. In the past, Apple has discouraged developers of doing so, but now the company is flat out rejecting applications that highlights an app’s price in the name. If a developer attempts to submit an application with ‘Free’ in the title, they will be presented with an error message. The error message states that the price is not considered part of metadata which means it cannot be included in an app’s name, icons, screenshots, or previews. Apple instead suggests developers include this information in the app’s description. Your app’s name, icons, screenshots, or previews to be displayed on the App Store include references to your app’s price, which is not considered a part of these metadata items. Please remove any references to your app’s price from your app’s name, including any references to your app being free or discounted. If you would like to advertise changes to your app’s price, it would be appropriate to include this information in the app description. Changes to your app’s price can be made in the Pricing and Availability section of iTunes Connect. Tags: App Store, Developers About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed ‘Siri, please dial 999 and save Mummy’s life’ 28 Mar 2017 5 Apple, iOS, Law & order, Mobile Post navigation Previous: India extends ‘Orwellian’ ID card scheme as critics warn of risks Next: eBay to ‘downgrade’ verification by switching to SMS by Lisa Vaas 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit London’s Metropolitan Police have released a recording of an emergency call made by a four-year-old boy that saved his mother’s life. The boy, who identified himself as Roman, told the emergency service call handler that his mother was dead. She was, in fact, unconscious, lying on the floor. To make the call, Roman had unlocked his mother’s mobile phone by pressing her thumb to it. Then, he used Apple’s Siri voice assistant to ask for help. Siri dialed 999: the British emergency number. Police were dispatched after the call handler stayed on the phone talking with Roman long enough to piece together his address in Kenley, south London. They arrived 13 minutes after the call and forced their way in to find Roman and his two brothers inside with their mother, who was lying unconscious on the floor. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More Paramedics were able to give what the Met’s Command and Control Unit (MetCC) called life-saving first aid to the woman. She regained consciousness, after which she was taken to the hospital. Police released this audio of the call in the hope that people teach their kids what their home address is and how to call police or emergency services in an emergency: Chief Superintendent Ade Adelekan, from the MetCC, where 999 calls are handled: If you do nothing else today, then I’d implore any parents of young children to sit down with them and make sure they know what to do in this kind of situation and that they know how to contact police or other emergency services in an emergency. As this case demonstrates so poignantly, it could really be the difference between life and death. It’s an amazing story, and thanks to his quick thinking and by asking Siri for help, this little boy saved his mum’s life, and it means she is still here and can be extremely proud of him and his brothers. It is an amazing story, but it’s not the first of its kind. In June last year, an Australian mother, rushing to the nursery when a baby monitor showed her one-year-old had stopped breathing, dropped her phone while she was turning on the light. She still managed to tell Siri to call for help while she performed CPR. Both she and her husband credited the few precious seconds that Siri gave them for potentially making all the difference. The outcome of that particular story is one of the upsides of the fact that recent iPhones can be set to always be listening for commands. That new feature came about in iOS 9, when Apple enabled activation of the built-in personal assistant at the sound of your voice, rather than waiting for you to hold down the Home button. If that’s turned on, Siri can not only open music and send text messages; it can also make hands-free phone calls on its own while you drive, or, obviously, in critical situations like that faced by the Australian family last year. Note that Siri in hands-free mode only works on newer models when not plugged in to a power source. Older models – at least back to 5s – need to be plugged in to a power source to enable Siri to work in hands-free mode. Other phone brands can also be set up for hands-free voice assistance, of course. This story illustrates one good reason to activate the feature. But your kids don’t need to know all that. What they should know, as the MetCC said, is their home address. Another part of their training should be how to unlock a phone and how to summon help – be it through a voice assistant or pressing an emergency services number like 999 or 911. Roman’s mother is probably thanking her lucky stars that Roman knew how to do just that.

I would add that it should be dependent on the battery status of the phone though. If you have barely enough battery left to make the call it wouldn’t be very helpful if collecting the GPS of your location drains what’s left of your battery. Reply TenguTech says: March 28, 2017 at 9:21 pm You can dial an emergency number on iPhones (and I expect most other phones) without unlocking them. On an iPhone the screen screen where you enter your pin has an ‘Emergency’ button. Press this and you can enter the emergency phone number. Reply Brian T.

Apple has now purchased Workflow and the team behind it. As you may recall, the Apple Design Award-winning Workflow is an automation app for iOS in the same vein as Automator on the Mac (see “Apple Announces 2015 Design Award Winners,” 10 June 2015). You can use it to perform actions in supported apps automatically. For instance, you can use Workflow to send your estimated time of arrival to a friend, upload photos, or shorten a URL. Apple usually pulls acquired apps from the App Store, but not this time. Instead, Workflow is now available for free. Unfortunately, Apple has dropped support within Workflow for Google Chrome, Google Maps, LINE, Pocket, Telegram, and Uber, and Workflow Gallery submissions are no longer being accepted. Developer Marco Arment points out that may be more because of legal issues than any particular strategy. Recent Automation News -- This acquisition is a plot twist in Apple’s ongoing automation saga. In November 2016, Apple eliminated the position of Product Manager of Automation Technologies (see “Understanding Apple’s Marginalization of the Mac,” 21 November 2016). The man who filled that position for two decades was Sal Soghoian, a legend in the Apple power user community who championed technologies such as AppleScript and Automator. Among other consulting projects, Sal is now helping the Omni Group with automation in their apps. Apple’s unceremonious elimination of Soghoian caused much concern in the Mac community, despite reassurances from Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering. It certainly did nothing to alleviate concerns that Apple no longer cares about professional users. Many of you made your concerns heard loud and clear in “73 Mac Automation Stories from TidBITS Readers” (19 January 2017), which collected amazing stories of how you’ve used the Mac’s automation technologies. And yes, Adam did send the collection to Craig Federighi and Tim Cook. No, he didn’t hear back. Our curiosity was piqued further when Soghoian publicly cautioned Apple to not replace existing automation tools with app extensions (see “Is Apple Planning to Replace Automation with App Extensions?,” 12 January 2017). So what does Apple’s purchase of Workflow mean for Apple’s professional and power users? Overall, the acquisition seems like a positive sign, but big questions remain. I don’t want to speculate about the future of Apple automation too broadly, but we can make some inferences based on what we know about the company. Apple Sees the iPad as the Future -- Despite declining sales growth, Apple appears committed to the iPad as the future of computing, releasing products like the iPad Pro, accessories like the Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard, and iPad-only apps like Swift Playgrounds. One big missing puzzle piece for the iPad’s professional future is system-wide automation. Tools like Workflow, Editorial, and Pythonista have existed for years on the iPad, but they lack the system integration, ease-of-use, and capabilities of Automator and AppleScript on the Mac. If Workflow were integrated into iOS with a system for third-party app integration, it could become a powerful, easy-to-use automation tool. However, Apple would have to build out the automation underpinnings in iOS before that could happen. Workflow currently uses a kludgy system called x-callback-url, developed by Greg Pierce and Marco Arment. It was a clever workaround when they introduced it in 2010, taking advantage of iOS’s URL schemes to let apps communicate with each other, but Apple could do much better. In a Twitter conversation with Pierce, Arment said, “The crazy thing is that URL-scheme bouncing between apps is still necessary for so many useful things on iOS. I always assumed that it’d be a few-years-long hack until iOS caught up and gave us something better. Maybe now it will.” Sal Soghoian has pointed out the difference between app extensions and true user automation; the question is if Apple sees app extensions as being sufficient for Workflow’s underpinnings. That would be better than nothing, of course, but app extensions are more akin to what Services provide in macOS (if you don’t remember Services, check out “OS X Hidden Treasures: Services,” 5 February 2016). One big question about an automation scheme based on app extensions and a Workflow front end is just how powerful it could be. Could it compare to what can be achieved with Automator and AppleScript on the Mac, or would it be closer to Workflow’s current limits? For a far more capable system, Apple could create something in iOS like the Apple event system that enables apps to communicate with one another on the Mac. In an ideal scenario for those who support Mac automation, Apple would bring actual Apple events to iOS. Then a developer would have to build on that by creating a terminology — a scripting dictionary containing commands and objects — and having the app listen for and respond to incoming Apple events. On the Mac, AppleScript is one of the main ways that users can interact with apps via Apple events, but I can’t see Apple porting AppleScript to iOS. The challenge Apple events face in iOS is the tension between scriptability and security — the kinds of hooks that are necessary for scriptability can be used as an attack vector unless the system has been designed carefully to limit that. The Apple event system on the Mac treads that line by operating at the user level; to avoid being exploited, any iOS approach would likely have to be similarly or even more restrictive. Apple Sees Swift as the One Language to Rule Them All -- Along with the iPad, Apple sees Swift as the future of development, going so far as to open-source it (see “Apple’s Swift Programming Language Is Now Open Source,” 3 December 2015) and build the friendly Swift Playgrounds iPad app to help kids learn how to use it (see “Playing Around with Swift on the iPad,” 13 June 2016). Beyond its role in developing traditional apps, what’s interesting about Swift is that it can be used as a scripting language. Developer Filip W proved this concept years ago — see “Using Swift as a Scripting Language” (6 August 2014), although we haven’t heard much about Swift’s use as a scripting language since. Of course, Swift can’t control Mac or iOS apps yet — it would need something like JavaScript for Automation (JXA), which is a set of special libraries that lets scripters use JavaScript instead of AppleScript for interapplication communication. I bet Apple would like to have Swift become the preferred scripting language across all its platforms. Then, people could start with scripting and move on to full-fledged app development without having to learn another language. By bridging the gap between scripters and developers, Apple could expand its ecosystem. Apple Wants macOS and iOS to Share Common Foundations -- Since the beginning, iOS has shared a common core with macOS. Over time, the two platforms have traded capabilities — usually new features developed on iOS going “back to the Mac.” In the case of scripting, it would make more sense for Apple to move the Apple event model to iOS, likely in a restricted way, than to come up with something completely new for iOS that would then need to be evangelized to all Mac developers in the other direction. The question is how closely the iOS system will match up with the Apple events that Mac automation relies on now. If Apple were to start supporting a subset of Apple events in iOS, giving users access in iOS via Workflow and Swift, it would be easy to imagine Workflow coming to the Mac to replace or supplement Automator (Swift is obviously already available for Mac users). It seems likely that Apple will announce something related to Workflow and iOS automation at WWDC in June 2017, with an eye toward it shipping in some form in iOS 11 in September. Or, if my excitement is getting the better of me, it might all have to wait until iOS 12 in 2018. Perhaps Apple will split the difference, and do what it did with Siri. At first, Siri could perform actions only with built-in iOS functionality and Apple apps. With iOS 10, though, Apple opened Siri up to a few types of apps, including apps for messaging, ride booking, payments, VoIP calling, workouts, and CarPlay. iOS automation might similarly be limited to a small subset of what’s possible on the Mac today, enabling Apple to feel out the security implications before making it more capable in future releases. How that would affect Workflow coming to the Mac is hard to guess. It might come with macOS 10.13 this September, or it may be an iOS-only feature for a year, and show its face on the Mac with macOS 10.14 in 2018. Beyond any speculation, we can see one thing for sure from Apple’s acquisition of Workflow: the company hasn’t lost interest in automation, which is good news. But the devil is in the details, especially in a system that has to balance user capabilities against security.   READERS LIKE YOU! Support TidBITS by becoming a member today!

My scripts don't need classes, inheritance, object reuse, or data hiding. And requiring me to learn a completely obfuscated OO syntax and the complex rules that accompany OO development & debugging when I don't write scripts every day is simply user-hostile. I have no interest in "mov[ing] on to full-fledged app development without having to learn another language," and so, I disagree that "By bridging the gap between scripters and developers, Apple could expand its ecosystem." If Apple were to go down this path, it would be just another way of making Macs harder to use. AppleScript has its flaws, all right, but it is more accessible than Swift. But, for the reasons & assumptions you state, it is inevitable that one day AppleScript Editor, then osascript, will be discarded for Swift. (PS: I am a former Intel assembly language/C/VisualBasic system & application arch/dev who has always hated OO for the reasons above.) Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-28 19:14 Our hope is that AppleScript wouldn't disappear even if Swift were to become Apple's focus. I don't have a sense of whether Swift's OO features would get in the way when used for scripting. Did you see http://www.strathweb.com/2014/06/using-swift-general-purpose-scripting-language/ Reply has  2017-03-28 20:57 @Adam: AppleScript is well into the long tail of its lifecycle. It should've been replaced years ago, but with a much better *end-user* language. The real problem isn't the death of the AppleScript language, it's that the [now-ex] Automation team's repeated failure to make *App Automation* a success in ObjC/Python/Ruby/JavaScript/Swift/etc too, it has only thousands of users instead of millions, thus Apple has NO reason to fix, improve, or bother keeping the underlying Apple event IPC infrastructure and Apple Event Object Model. It's that IPC infrastructure and the thousands of AEOM-aware apps that support it (and the many more that could) which is the incredibly valuable bit, not the language(s) that use it. The irony is that the Apple Event Object Model's very-high-level QUERY-DRIVEN interface should be the perfect complement to Apple's new QUERY-ISSUING UI, Siri! But if Apple's ostensible Automation Product Manager failed to see and sell that vision, what chance anyone else will? Reply has  2017-03-28 20:34 Swift and AppleScript are both awful languages in their own rights. Swift is just C++ with rubberized corners. AppleScript to its credit was a genuine attempt to try something new; unfortunately its own excessive cleverness backfires something terrible. (BTW, given your background, surprised you don't prefer Perl or Bash, or even Tcl, for scripting?) A good end-user [AND pro-user] scripting language would be a modern Logo successor. Frankly all Algol/C-descended languages suck: "Ugg bang rock!" is the absolute limit of their expressiveness, and even then you're being eaten by raptors. (And yes, OOP is overrated and overapplied, though both Swift and AS support it and neither requires it unless you're writing, say, Cocoa apps. But if you ever used JavaScript or Smalltalk, you'd know the way that C* langs "do OO" is an abomination that hardly resembles the original concept. Blame the state of modern "CS education".) Reply has  2017-03-28 20:12 "Of course, Swift can’t control Mac or iOS apps yet" This is wrong: Swift *can* control Mac Apps via 1. macOS's crippled crappy ScriptingBridge framework (when it works, though it's even more awful in Swift than it is in ObjC), or 2. via the SwiftAutomation framework (https://bitbucket.org/hhas/swiftae/) I wrote a couple years ago which does provide *AppleScript-quality* application scripting support. (Apple previously considered appscript, SwiftAutomation's predecessor, for 10.5 but alas its internal bureaucracy nixed that.) I even offered Sal SwiftAutomation for free back in 2015 cos I knew how important this was, and the idiot blew me off with incredibly asinine NotInventedHere BS. THAT is the reason why Swift doesn't provide AppleScript-quality application scripting support as standard; why Mac Automation has totally failed to win hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic new App Automation users AND developers; and why Sal Soghoian (rightly) doesn't have a job at Apple any more.

By Mary-Ann Russon March 29, 2017 13:36 BST Ransomware is finally coming for the iPhone, so you'd better update your devices sooniStock and IBTimes UK All Apple device users are encouraged to update their iPhones and iPads as soon as possible to avoid being plagued by mobile ransomware that exploits a security vulnerability in Mobile Safari on iOS to extort money from people who watch pornography on iOS devices in the UK, US, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. Security firm Lookout discovered that over the last month, cybercriminals launched a particularly nasty mobile malware campaign known as "scareware" that causes the Safari web browser on some iOS devices to lock users out if they use their Apple phones or tablets to view porn or other controversial content. The attack works by exploiting a security flaw in how Mobile Safari handles JavaScript pop-up windows, which exists in every version of iOS from iOS 8 onwards to create a denial of service (DoS) attack on the browser. Apple has patched the flaw in iOS 10.3, which was released on Monday 27 March. Pay £100 in iTunes gift cards, or else Update your phone now - security researchers have discovered iOS ransomware that locks Safari if victims don't pay ransoms using iTunes gift cardsLookout Once the attack initiates, the victim is taken to a website whereby a fake notice from their relevant country's law enforcement agency pops up. In the UK, victims receive a message from the Metropolitan Police explaining that the user is prevented from using the internet on their device until they pay a fine of £100 ($124.27) using a prepaid iTunes gift card. The user is instructed to send an SMS text message with the iTunes gift code to a UK mobile number that is listed as a "state number". If you're in the US, you'll be taken to a .com domain and receive a fake notice from the Department of Justice. If you're in Ireland, the notice comes from the Department Of Justice and Equality; in Australia, it's the Attorney-General's Department; and in New Zealand, it's the New Zealand Police. "After the payment, the device will be automatically unblocked. In case of refusal of paying the fine, or trying to unblock the device without paying, case materials will be delivered to Metropoliten Police [misspelled] for making the decision against institution of criminal proceeding due to commitment of crime," the notice reads. "You have 12 hours to pay the fine." Another fake website seen by the security researchers in the UK shows a fake Interpol logo and the message: "Your device has been locked for illegal pornography, Send email to cybercrimegov@europe.com for unlocking." Attack can be mitigated, but seriously, just update your device The attack causes an infinite loop of dialog prompts, and no matter how many times the user clicks "OK" on the window, it will continue to pop up and prevent the user from using the web browser. However, unlike computer ransomware campaigns, it is possible to beat the malware by clearing the Safari cache and erasing all web history and data in Settings > Safari > Clear History and Website Data. "The group involved in this campaign has purchased a large number of domains that try to catch users that are seeking controversial content on the internet and coerce them into paying a ransom to them," the researchers wrote in a blog post. "Individuals are strongly encouraged to protect their iOS devices against this attack and take advantage of a number of other security patches that Apple made available in iOS 10.3."

The announcement is expected today (March 29) in New York., but people across the globe will be eager to get their hands on what promises to be the South Korean company's most cutting-edge and sleek mobile. The Galaxy S8 is likely to feature some big changes from last year's S7 and S7 edge and gadget fans will be keen to see the real deal after months of leaks and wild speculation, The Mirror reports. As is common with tech manufacturers now, when the S8 does arrive it will likely do so in two different sizes. Early indicators suggest that we'll see a 5.1-inch and a 5.5-inch model. Read More Details of new Samsung Galaxy phone leaked What's not clear is whether or not Samsung will introduce an 'edge' version of the new phone with a curved screen. It has taken this approach with both the S7 and the S6 in the last two years. Samsung is also only starting to recover from the disastrous global recall and cancellation of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone. And then there's the small matter of Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus that are currently proving a hit with fans, despite the controversial decision to remove the headphone jack. Whilst Appleis refining and stripping down its phones, Samsung appears to be going the other way. If the current crop of internet rumours are to be believed, the company will be throwing everything it has into its next blower. So, what do we know so far? We've collected all the latest whisperings right here and will continue to update this piece as we learn more. Read More Argos launches its Big January Clearance sale - and here's what's included Latest news As the date of the official reveal gets closer, Samsung doesn't seem to be able to keep the new handset hidden. A fresh set of images, supposedly showing a finished version of the Galaxy S8, have arrived on the internet. These are believed to be of a "jet back" version of the new smartphone and were posted on the website slashleaks . The site calls it a dummy phone and, unfortunately, doesn't switch it on at any point. But the pictures still give us a good idea of what to expect when Samsung pulls the veil away next week. Read More How you can make up to £1,000 selling your "classic" old phone Release date Rather than reveal the phone at Mobile World Congress as in previous years, Samsung is hosting its own event on March 29. The event is called Samsung Unpacked and it is widely expected to be the official unveiling of the Galaxy S8. The teaser image for the event showed the outline of a phone and the line "unbox your phone". Samsung confirmed it will be streaming the event live over its website. Read More Samsung Galaxy Note 7 users told to turn off phone and stop using it Price As with Apple's iPhones, the Samsung Galaxy handsets have more or less plateaued when it comes to price. The current 32GB S7 comes in at £569 whilst the slightly larger S7 edge is £639. It's unlikely that Samsung's new phones will deviate too far from this kind of pricing. So you better start saving. What could change things is if Samsung decides to offer multiple storage options. At the moment you can only get the S7 with 32GB of storage. If Samsung opts to increase this to 64GB or even 128GB the price could increase also. However, the company could also keep the storage space as it is and instead include the capacity of the microSD card slot. Read More This simple thing can protect your kids from video nasties on YouTube Design Posted to Twitter by serial leaker Evan Blass, an image appears to show a marketing photo of the Samsung Galaxy S8 face-on. It reveals the gigantic front screen and the lack of a physical home button - two prominent rumours that have circulated for months. Samsung upgrades the Gear VR with a controller for virtual reality pointing and shooting. Much has been made of the S8's display and, as this picture shows, it appears to take up the entire front of the device with hugely reduced bezels on the top and bottom of the phone. The curving screen appears to have been carried over from the Galaxy S7. Read More Which friends have deleted you on Facebook? Here is how you find out It also shows the phone's lock screen and redesigned clock face. The power button can be clearly seen on the side of the phone. Perhaps in an effort to rescue something from the doomed Galaxy 7 Note, Samsung could be planning to put an edge-to-edge display in the new S8. That's the message coming from tech site Droid-Life , which claims the new S8 will come in two sizes and won't feature any bezels. Samsung will release a 5.7-inch model and a whopping 6.2-inch model - which makes it practically a tablet in our eyes. What's more, the site is claiming Samsung will ditch the home button - something that has always been a feature of Galaxy phones. Read More Can you haggle in Liverpool's high street shops? "With the removal of the home button, it should be expected that we might see on-screen buttons, instead of Samsung’s long-standing capacitive keys," claims the site. Samsung is also reportedly planning to put a pair of stereo speakers on the forthcoming Galaxy S8 flagship phone - something Apple did with the iPhone 7. The news comes from gadget site Fone Arena , which alleges that the new blower might also sport branding from audio company HARMAN. "According to our sources this dual speaker technology will have a branding, like the HTC’s Boomsound," wrote the site. "It could also come with HARMAN branding, and powered by technology from HARMAN that it recently agreed to acquire for about $8.0 billion." Read More A look back at the must-have items which sent Liverpool shoppers into a frenzy Specs Aside from the aforementioned 4K screen, there are a few rumours circulating about what kind of power the S8 may have under the bonnet. Samsung's cameras have been exceptionally good recently, but the proliferation of dual-lens snappers from the likes of Apple, Huawei and LG may inspire it to follow suit. According to tech site Trusted Reviews , Samsung is indeed planning to include dual-lens cameras in its next phone. A recent leak, reported on by the gadget site Pocket Lint , seems to have a clear picture of the S8's specs. It says the new phone will pack in 6GB of RAM and a 30-megapixel camera. Read More Apple launches red iPhone 7 alongside new iPad There will also be a 4,200mAh battery which - providing it doesn't explode - should easily see the phone through 24 hours of solid usage. A report on Samsung-watching site SamMobile hit on the fact that the S8 may include an Exynos 8895 processor coupled with a Mali-G71 GPU. According to the site, that means the new phone will be up to 1.8 times more powerful than the already-impressive Galaxy S7. What's more, SamMobile echoes other sites that suggest the S8 will have a 5.2-inch 4K-capable display. The reason? Samsung's pushing heavily into virtual reality and having a powerful screen resolution means you can use the phone in VR headsets like the Samsung Galaxy Gear and Google Daydream VR. No headphone jack It's being rumoured that Samsung will follow Apple's lead and ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack on the Samsung Galaxy S8. If true, it would force users to adopt wireless headphones or, potentially, use a USB Type-C compatible pair, if that's what the new handset uses for charging. The latter is what Samsung fan site SamMobile believes will be the case when the Galaxy S8 is unveiled at Mobile World Congress in 2017. By ditching the port, the company could make the phone sturdier and likely improve waterproofing while keeping the casing slim. But it's also likely to irk a huge number of people who rely on the old-fashioned analogue connection. Read More How much is the Nokia 3310 reboot and where to buy it in the UK Apple wasn't the first major manufacturer to remove the headphone jack, but the decision caused the biggest stir when the iPhone 7 was unveiled. Third-party manufacturers have raced to offer wireless headphones and phone cases to resolve the issue. Amid rumours that Samsung is planning to follow Apple's lead and remove the headphone jack on the Galaxy S8, some sources are now claiming that Samsung will launch a pair of lightweight bluetooth earbuds – similar in design and functionality to Apple's AirPods. Samsung already offers a pair of wireless earbuds, called the Gear IconX, which track your physical activity, have enough internal storage for around 1,000 music tracks and include a small touchpad to control music playback. However, SamMobile reports that the South Korean company will launch a new pair of wireless earbuds alongside the Galaxy S8 in 2017, citing sources with knowledge of Samsung's product roadmap. The new earphones could integrate with Samsung's new voice assistant, Viv, allowing users to dictate messages, request songs, make phone calls and ask for directions - just like users of Apple's AirPods can with Siri. Read More New Wetherspoons app means you may never have to queue at the bar again Bixby personal assistant Samsung's next flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S8 , will come with a new artificially intelligent personal assistant called Bixby. Like Apple's Siri, Bixby responds to spoken commands, allowing users to control their phones with their voices alone. However, Samsung claims that Bixby offers a "deeper experience" than other voice agents or assistants in the market. Firstly, when using a Bixby-enabled application, Samsung's personal assistant can support almost every task that the application is capable of performing - so you don't have to remember which features work with voice command and which don't. Secondly, you can call upon Bixby at any time and it will understand the current context and state of the application, allowing you to continue what you're doing without interruption. The Samsung Galaxy S8 will come with a dedicated Bixby button on the side of the device, which you can press to call up the virtual assistant. To begin with, only a subset of pre-installed applications will be Bixby-enabled, but this set will continue to expand over time.

Politicians need to wise up or shut up about it A deep lack of understanding of technology has been exposed in the great encryption debate. By David Gilbert Updated March 29, 2017 16:13 BST The debate over encryption used on apps is raging following the London terror attacks, but politicians need to understand how it works before talk of banning it.Reuters When Amber Rudd, the Home Secretary, spoke out about how to tackle the problem of terrorists using online forums to spread their messages of hate and fear she exposed a laughable lack of understanding about the technology. "The best people who understand the technology, who understand the necessary hashtags to stop this stuff ever being put up, not just taken down, but ever being put up in the first place are going to be them," Rudd said to the BBC. No, I'm not sure what she means either. Unsurprisingly Rudd's comments were instantly lampooned by Twitter users but beyond the embarrassment factor and the snickering, there is real worry when Rudd starts talking about banning encryption. She told the Andrew Marr Show that it was "completely unacceptable" that police and intelligence agencies are unable to view messages send by Khalid Masood on WhatsApp, a service he is reported to have been using moments before he carried out the attack on the UK Parliament which killed four people. "We need to make sure that organisations like WhatsApp, and there are plenty of others like that, don't provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other," Rudd said. The "plenty of others" include Apple's iMessage which also provides users with end-to-end encryption by default, meaning that not even the companies who offer the service can access the content of the messages. Flawed theories There are some basic issues with Rudd's call. Firstly, because WhatsApp has end-to-end encryption turned on by default, it wouldn't even be able to access any messages even it if wanted to. Secondly, if the police have Masood's phone — which they presumably do if he was using it moments before the attack — then they will be able to access his unencrypted WhatsApp conversations. If the phone is locked with a passcode, then the police will need to talk to Apple or Google, not Facebook. Finally, because Masood was not seen as a threat by the intelligence services, then even being given access to WhatsApp through some backdoor would not have prevented the attack – as they would not have been monitoring his communications. Later on Sky News, Rudd sought to clarify her view on encryption, saying she wants different rules for different people. "End-to-end encryption has a place. Cybersecurity is really important and getting it wrong costs the economy and costs people money, so I support end-to-end encryption." Rudd was quickly backed up fellow MP Nadine Dorries. We need to "rise up against companies like #Apple and #WhatsApp" she tweeted from her Apple iPhone, adding that rather than looking to undermine encryption entirely, she wanted to "just develop a terrorist-related exception." Selective encryption The complete stupidity of suggesting you can pick-and-choose what is encrypted only goes to prove the point that many politicians who are charged with protecting national security are simply not equipped to make informed decisions on this topic. As security expert Bruce Schneier says: "I can't build an access technology that only works with proper legal authorisation, or only for people with a particular citizenship or the proper morality. The technology just doesn't work that way. If a backdoor exists, then anyone can exploit it." Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales tried to boil it down to its most basic: It is hard to believe that politicians still believe that banning encryption is a good idea. David Cameron floated the idea of breaking encryption following the Charlie Hebdo attack back in 2015. His call came just days after the attacks, preying on the fears of the public in the wake of such a public and horrific event. Just like Rudd two years later, Cameron also spoke about banning these "safe spaces" where terrorists communicate. Rudd said Sunday that she now wants to legislate in order to force companies like Facebook and Apple to build backdoors into their encrypted messaging platforms. But the thing is, Rudd already has the power to access whatever data she wants. It's called the IP Bill and it became law just last November. The draconian surveillance powers its hands the UK's intelligence services have been widely criticized by privacy advocates but these criticisms were waved aside by the government. As Jimmy Wales says, you cannot selectively break encryption, it is a binary choice. It either works or it doesn't. By undermining encryption in order to try and seek an edge over terrorist communicating online, the UK government would also undermine private communications for every other citizen in the world, not to mention secure online banking, e-commerce and many other tools we have become used to using every day. We have seen time and again that simply giving the intelligence agencies more and more data is not the answer, it just makes it harder to find the information that really matters. "The main reason governments don't like encryption is because it is a barrier to them indiscriminately monitoring all our personal data," Allan Hogarth, head of advocacy at Amnesty International UK, told IBTimes UK. "They already have a range of tools at their disposal for surveillance of specific targets. Making the haystack bigger will not help find the needle of terrorism."

Instead the company regularly updates the current operating system throughout the year, adding new features and enhancements, as well as fixing problems and security issues should they arrise. In this article we will look at the latest updates to MacOS Sierra, also known as Mac OS X 10.12. We also have details of new features that are coming to MacOS Sierra as revealed by the most recent beta versions. If you'd like to read about the next version of macOS instead, read about the new macOS 10.13 update here. Looking for more information about Sierra? We also have a macOS Sierra review, a comparison between macOS Sierra and Mac OS X El Capitan so you know what's changed, and some handy macOS tips. What is the latest verison of Mac OS X, I mean macOS? When Apple announced its plans for the next version of its Mac operating system back in June 2016 the company surprised everyone by changing the name of Mac OS X to macOS to keep it in line with its other OS names (tvOS, iOS, watchOS 3). As a result the latest version of the Mac operating system is called macOS Sierra, although it's also known as version 10.12, so Apple hasn't completely lost the 10 from X (the X was always supposed to represent the number 10). macOS Sierra is a free update to Mac users using compatible devices. For a full rundown of the system requirements for macOS Sierra, and a list of compatible machines, read: Which Macs can run macOS Sierra? You can download Sierra from the Mac App Store. Your Mac will warn you as and when updates are available, plus you can check which version you are running by clicking on the Apple logo in the top left corner and selecting About this Mac. For details of how to download and install macOS Sierra read: How to update the Mac OS. Althoguh macOS Sierra was rolled out officially on 20 September 2016, there have been some updates since: macOS Sierra 10.12.1 After the launch event on 7 September, Apple released macOS Sierra 10.12.1, which brought numerous fixes and performance improvements. One new feature was the inclusion of pictures taken in Portrait mode on the iPhone 7 Plus. macOS Sierra 10.12.2 Sierra 10.12.2 was released in December 2016, with the aim of improving the stability and performance of all Macs, so those running older versions of macOS are advised to install Sierra. There were new desktop wallpapers and emoji icons, and Apple removed the battery time remaining indicator from MacBooks. macOS Sierra 10.12.3  macOS Sierra 10.12.3 became available in January 2017, with updates for all Mac users but specifically of interest to new MacBook Pro owners. For those users there's a Safari patch to fix the bug causing poor battery life, as well as a fix for the amend GPU errors that occurred during the encoding of Adobe Premiere video projects. Other Mac users will receive bug fixes for problems with importing images from digital cameras to third-party software and with previewing and searching certain PDF files, plus security fixes. macOS Sierra 10.12.4 Apple made Sierra 10.12.4 available for download on 27 March 2017. Features in 10.12.4 include: Night Shift, more Siri answers (regarding Cricket), and updates to the PDFKit APIs, so you PDFs should display better. Like Night Shift on the iPad and iPhone, this reduces the blue light emitted by the display, which is supposed to help you sleep better if you’re using your MacBook before going to bed. You can read more about How to get Night Shift on the Mac here: How to enable Dark Mode and Night Shift in iOS, MacOS & Apple TV macOS Sierra 10.12.5 Apple is now issuing beta versions of the next update to Sierra. If you want to download the beta you will need to be registered as an Apple Developer. Here's how to register as a beta tester. macOS Sierra features What's new in macOS Sierra? Auto Unlock with Apple Watch Apple has put several new features into the OS. The first announced on the night of its launch was Auto Unlock which allows you to unlock your Mac using your Apple Watch. No more typing in lengthy passwords after the screen goes off! A small addition, but no doubt will prove useful to those who have invested in the Apple Watch. Universal Clipboard Universal Clipboard was slightly overlooked, but it is a new, great way to sync your copy and paste data between devices. This could be best put into practice with an iPad Pro and a Mac: drawing direct onto the iPad before intelligently copying and pasting on to Mac documents. This is a great way of syncing information between devices and will stop the brain-hurt of emailing yourself pictures or even sticking stuff in the cloud to download to another device. Tapback in Messages app While the macOS variant of the Messages app may be lacking in some areas (text animations and smileys aren't available at the time of writing) it does have one very cool feature - tapbacks. Tapbacks, as introduced during the iOS 10 section at Apple's WWDC conference, allows users to react to a text message without sending messages like 'LOL'. In a Facebook Reactions-esque way, users can react to incoming messages by giving it a thumbs up (or down), Question mark, Heart and more.  iCloud Drive and Optimised Storage iCloud Drive also received a much needed update. For those of us familiar with sprinkling our Mac desktops with files that we need, rejoice - those files are mirrored on your other Macs (if you're rich) and on your iPhone. Optimised storage for iCloud will automatically back up older files, particularly those that you'll never use again like cache files. It'll make your storage go a lot further before you have to fork out for more, which is great news. It's nice to see Apple thinking about the smaller nuances of its services. Read next: How to use Mac menu bar in macOS Sierra Apple Pay A further excellent feature coming to macOS Sierra is Apple Pay for Mac. Apple Pay icons will now appear on the buy pages of certain merchants - all you need do is verify your purchases with Touch ID on your iPhone or using your Apple Watch. This will be initially supported in nine countries. Ahead of Apple's keynote, rumours had suggested that at some point Apple will add a Touch ID fingerprint scanner to its Mac range. This more conservative way of introducing Apple Pay to the Mac still provides many of the benefits, and it's still possible that Touch ID will eventually come to the Mac, too. However, the introduction of Auto Unlock mentioned above seems to be the solution to unlocking the Mac securely without the need for Touch ID. Tabs Tabs have also been lovingly reimagined - no longer restricted to Safari, those apps that allow for tabs now (with no developer work needed) will allow you to multi-tab. Picture-in-Picture Picture-in-Picture mode allows you to thumbnail view photos and, more impressively, videos from certain apps while doing other things. So long, productivity! Although, for those who work in video editing, features like this will be another Godsend. Apple File System (APFS) Now while this may not be as appealing as many of the other features of macOS Sierra, Apple's new proprietary file system is worth a mention. Why? One of the most exciting features of the new file system is space sharing, which helps partitioned drives utilise space on the fly. Let's say you had a 1TB drive with two 100GB partitions, with one nearly full and one almost empty. In this situation, space sharing wouldn't limit the almost-full partition, and would instead note that there is 800GB of free space (the total free disk space) for both partitioned drives. Essentially, APFS treats the partition limits as containers that can be expanded when required.  Duplicated files won't take up any extra space either - if you duplicate a 2GB drive it wouldn't take up 4GB, instead the copy would access the original version. Then, if you make changes to the oriignal version, the new data is copied to a separate block preserving the original state.  Essentially, the new file system should make your macOS life a little easier behind the scenes. Siri for Mac After all the little bits and pieces, Apple showed us what we were hoping for - Siri on a Mac. A particularly useful and impressive feature that was demoed live on stage was searching through documents using Siri. The voice assistant will also let you be far more flexible with macOS Sierra - you'll be able to image search online with Siri, and have the ability to drag and drop those images directly into a plethora of apps. Siri is already on iPhone, iPad and even the Apple TV, so it was only a matter of time before Siri came to Mac too. After all, Microsoft already has Cortana in Windows (and has done since Windows 8.1) and Chrome has Google Now.

Developers will take any advantage they can get in the overly crowded app stores for Apple's platforms, and that includes reminding potential customers that their app is completely free to use. To that end, it's common to see "free" included as part of the app name. But in the iOS and macOS app stores, such practices are no longer allowed. Apple makes it clear in the App Store guidelines (section 2.3.7) that app names must be unique and should "not include terms or descriptions that are not the name of the app." But now, according to VentureBeat, Apple is clamping down on the practice by rejecting app submissions with the following reason stated: "Your app's name, icons, screenshots, or previews to be displayed on the App Store include references to your app's price, which is not considered a part of these metadata items." Related The 100 Best iPhone Apps of 2017 The 100 Best iPhone Apps of 2017 The rejection goes on to state that any reference to price should be removed from the name, even if it is a reference to being free or discounted. A change in price can only be advertised in the app description of the Pricing and Availability section. What this means is all new apps submitted to Apple's app stores, be they for iOS or macOS, will cease to reference price in the name (or screenshots and previews). Any apps already referencing price in the name will continue to do so, but if the app gets updated it seems likely Apple will reject it until the price reference is removed from the name. Over time, it means all price references should disappear. This poses a dilemma for any developer launching two versions of a game, one free and ad-supported and the other paid-for and free of adverts. Will including the difference in the app description alone be enough to differentiate them? Maybe we'll get some clever naming to get around the new restriction.

The 1.1 update also lets you use Siri to control your Apple TV viewing, but not from the iPad’s regular home screen — instead, you can use voice commands by holding a microphone button on the app’s UI to search for, select, pause, and play your media. It’s taken quite a while for the company to bring Apple TV Remote capabilities to iPad. Apple SVP Eddy Cue originally teased the software back in 2015, saying it would be arriving in early 2016. In reality, it didn’t hit the iPhone until last August, where it served as a more advanced and feature-rich version of the physical remote that shipped with Apple TV boxes. They’re useful for regular viewers, who won’t now have to fumble for tiny remotes, but both iPhone and iPad variants of the app still don’t let you watch Apple TV while on the move.
