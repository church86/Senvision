But this new device follows on the back of the previous Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL releases; so how do these devices compare with the undoubted market leader, the iPhone 7? Image Source: Amazon.com Size Firstly, the iPhone 7 is the most compact of the four devices at 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm (5.44 x 2.64 x 0.28 in). This compares favorably with the Google Pixel, with its size being 143.8 x 69.5 x 8.5 mm (5.66 x 2.74 x 0.33 in). However, the Google Pixel XL – 154.7 x 75.7 x 8.5 mm (6.09 x 2.98 x 0.33 in) – is the smaller of the two phablets, with the iPhone 7 Plus measuring 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm (6.23 x 3.07 x 0.29 in). Weight The iPhone 7 is also marginally lighter than the Google Pixel, but the iPhone 7 Plus is significantly heavier than the Google Pixel XL. It is certainly surprising that the iPhone 7 Plus is a full 50 grammes heavier than its smaller cousin. Display Both of the Google Pixel devices have superior screen resolution to their Apple counterparts. The iPhone 7 can display only 750 x 1,334 Pixels, compared to the full HD resolution of the Google Pixel. While the iPhone 7 Plus resolution is beefed up to full HD, the Google Pixel XL is a quad HD smartphone. Apple has certainly fallen behind the pack slightly in this department, and there will be pressure on the Californian corporation to deliver an increased screen resolution when the iPhone 8 is released. Screen size The Google Pixel has a somewhat larger screen than the iPhone 7, with the Google smartphone featuring a five-inch display compared to the 4.7-inch screen of the Apple contender. Both of the phablets are fitted with 5.5-inch displays. The extra size of the Google Pixel of course helps to explain why the weight of the device is higher. Processor Exactly the same quad-core 2.34 GHz processor (2 x Hurricane + 2 x Zephyr) is fitted in both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. This gives the Apple device the edge of the Google Pixel range, with both handsets being armed with quad-core processors (2 x 2.15 GHz Kryo & 2 x1.6 GHz Kryo). When coupled with the proprietary software of the Apple corporation, it must be said that this translates into a pretty significant performance advantage. Storage The various storage quantities offered by the devices are listed below: iPhone 7 – 32 / 128 / 256GB iPhone 7 Plus – 32 / 128 / 256GB Google Pixel – 32 / 128GB Google Pixel XL – 32 / 128GB Apple smartphones must be given the edge in this department, purely due to the 256GB option offered in both iPhone 7 models. It is interesting that Apple has particularly emphasized this aspect of smartphone performance, with the corporation obviously envisaging that consumers will wish to store significant amounts of media within their iPhone devices. This probably feeds into the Apple App Store; such a massively important source of revenue for the market-leading consumer electronics company. RAM Both of the Google Pixel handsets are armed with 4GB of RAM, meaning that they have a significant advantage over both of their Apple rivals. Indeed, the smartphone version of the Pixel has double the RAM of the 2GB smartphone iPhone 7. The iPhone 7 Plus does feature 3GB of RAM, but Google has clearly won out in this area. Nonetheless, Apple’s combination of proprietary hardware and software is known to deliver outstanding results regardless of raw specs. Camera All four of the cameras included in these devices deliver 12-megapixels, suggesting that the photographic capabilities of this quartet of handsets is rather similar. This is a reasonable conclusion, but it is worth noting that Apple includes quad-LED in both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, while the Google Pixel devices have only dual-LED. It will be interesting to see what Apple can do to develop the camera in the iPhone 8 generation, and the device has already been linked with some outstanding and revolutionary technology. Battery The batteries included in both of the Google Pixel offerings are significantly larger than either of the iPhone 7 releases. The smartphone-sized iPhone 7 is fitted with a non-removable Li-Ion 1960 mAh battery. This compares with the non-removable Li-Ion 2770 mAh unit included in the Google Pixel. The larger iPhone 7 Plus has a non-removable Li-Ion 2900 mAh battery, but the Pixel XL features a non-removable Li-Ion 3450 mAh cell. This perhaps helps to explain why Apple has struggled with battery lifecycle in recent iPhone generations. Endurance rating Both of the Google Pixel devices marginally outperform their Apple counterparts in this critical aspect of smartphone performance. The iPhone 7 delivers an endurance rating of 61 hours; slightly less than the 64 hours offered by the Google Pixel. Meanwhile, the iPhone 7 Plus offers an endurance rating of 75 hours, still three hours less than the 78 hours delivered by the Pixel XL. Conclusion The specs of the Google Pixels certainly compare favorably to the iPhone 7, as perhaps could have been anticipated. Unlike Samsung, Apple has never concentrated on cramming excessive specs into devices, and has instead focused its attention on ensuring that the iPhone is as slick a package as possible. Nonetheless, the performance and advantages that the iPhone achieves via its combination of superior processing speed and proprietary hardware and software are far from insignificant, and help to continue to propel the iPhone to the very top of the consumer electronics industry.

(Photo : Justin Sullivan/Getty Images For Apple iPads) Apple is expected to freshen up its iPad Air lineup in March. The iPad Air 3 and iPad Mini 5 are highly believed to arrive that month. The iPad Mini lineup is, likewise, set for renew indicating Apple fans to perceive an iPad Mini 5 soon. However, speculations are claiming that the iPad Mini 5 is modified and dubbed as the iPad Pro Mini. The iPad Air 3 is still predicted regardless of reports that Apple has slain the iPad series as per Value Walk. The consumer-electronics monster is refusing to accept that iPad Air is one among the revealed Pro models. Advertisement Contribute to this Story Send us a tip Send us a photo or video Suggest a correction Apple is ever known for being keen in diminishing thickness of its devices. Therefore, iPad Air 3 is expected to be 6mm in depth. This hardware is the slimmest tablet ever unveiled by the company if proven true. Fans could anticipate Gold, Silver and Space Grey color selections with an addition of Rose Gold version. A 9.7-inch display with 2,048 x 1,536 resolution is probably to be retained in the alleged tablet computer. Apple Pencil support, an A9X chip, and a four-speaker audio system are also included among the specs. Apple could roll the camera in the iPad Air 3 similar to the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. The iPad Mini 5, on the other side, is a highly favorite and valued device series for Apple. The iPad models will be revealed in March as per reports in China. The announcement would include the second generation Apple Pencil. The iPad Mini 5 is also claimed to be 5mm in depth with 7000-series aluminum used in the Apple Watch range. This is for its durability, lightweight and prevention of bending. An adjustable display, Smart Connector from the iPad Pro with a foldable screen for easy storage is likely expected. In addition, the iPad Mini 5 will arrive with battery enhancement and three storage versions. As per DigiTimes, the 2017 iPads will be postponed to the second half of the year despite March as the highly predicted period. Their spare parts are yet to be determined.

Image: Vicky Leta/Mashable By Lance Ulanoff2017-02-05 21:23:52 UTC I understand alternate facts. Sometimes my iPhone’s battery meter delivers them. Fact: I have a 18-month-old Apple iPhone 6. I keep it in good shape, never dropping it, subjecting it to extreme temperatures, or dunking it in bodies of water. I charge it regularly.  Fact: On a recent weekday afternoon, I picked up my iPhone, which had been sitting on my desk untouched for hours, and noticed it was reporting just 18% battery life. It was officially in the red. I quickly plugged it into a charger and, a moment later, the rating was 43%. SEE ALSO: LG's going above and beyond to make sure its next phone doesn't explode 18% to 43% — in seconds. I think that initial battery meter reading may have been an alternate fact and this iPhone battery problem is more widespread than I realized — or Apple is willing to admit. For months, I’d been hearing bizarre iPhone battery tales from friends, co-workers and family members. Last year, Apple beat back reports in China and the U.S. before finally admitting that some iPhone 6S device batteries were faulty. This iPhone battery problem is more widespread than I realized — or Apple is willing to admit. The problem is that these bizarre battery issues extend back to the still-in-use iPhone 5S and through to the iPhone 6S (but not, as far as I can tell, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, at least not yet). They include battery-percentage free falls, where you can watch your battery life drain from, say, 30% to zero in the space of a few minutes or suddenly shut down with 20-30% battery life remaining. There's also the perplexing sudden supercharge, like I described at the outset: The battery demands to be charged only to show hearty available battery life as soon as you plug it in. Even though many people complained to me about bizarre battery hiccups, I was unconvinced until I experienced virtually every one of them myself.  Apple has a lot of advice for managing iPhone battery life and I followed as much of it as possible: I made sure my iOS was up-to-date. I took a good look at which background apps were eating battery life, especially those with a lot of background refresh activity, and tried, where possible, to curb their use (Mail and Instagram were often near the top of the list for me). I used Low Power Mode. I even followed the advice I found on other sites and recalibrated the battery, letting it run down to zero to and then did a reboot holding the home and power button. None of these actions, however, prevented the battery life miscalculations from happening again. And they’re not helping others who have experienced the same bizarre battery life percentage issues. On the ground I already knew my own wife had watched her iPhone 5S shut down at 20% and 30%. I started asking friends and co-workers about their experiences. Pretty much anyone I mentioned iPhone battery issues knew what I was talking about or had an experience to share. While taking an Uber with two co-workers a few weeks ago, I quizzed them about their iPhone batteries (on their iPhone 6 and 6S devices). Both reported unexpected shutdowns at 20%. Then our driver piped up and said he’d has similar issues to the ones I described, even though he only had his phone for a year. Apple Support forums are full of similar complaints. Going back to the iPhone 5S and iOS 7.1, users recounted rapid battery drains. Those complaints persisted through the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, with some users also complaining that the phone got very hot. Apple won’t comment about what’s going on with the iPhone's rechargeable lithium-ion batteries or the iOS software that manages them, and it hasn't acknowledged any issue beyond unexpected shutdowns on some iPhones. 2 screenshots were taken minutes apart.

Wassup Apple? pic.twitter.com/0nScZmkqyT — Lance Ulanoff (@LanceUlanoff) January 24, 2017 However, late last year Apple did reveal that a small number of iPhone 6S devices manufactured between September and October 2015 had a battery issue and were eligible for free battery replacement. Then in December, and only on the Chinese version of its support site, Apple announced that there were some phones “outside the affected range” of phones that they knew had a battery defect that were also shutting down. This prompted the company to integrate new battery diagnostic software in an iOS update for all users. That software is out in the field now, gathering data for Apple. Early this year, a report surfaced claiming that Apple might extend the battery-replacement program to iPhone 6 devices. As I write this, though, Apple has yet to reveal what, if anything, it’s learned about the erratic behavior of some of its iPhone batteries or the software that manages them. Considering how intermittent and inconsistent these issues are, that’s not that surprising. Plus, there’s the complexity of lithium-ion technology itself. Inside your phone Lithium-ion is, essentially, live chemistry inside your phone. Every lithium-ion battery is made of sheets of positive (lithium cobalt oxide) and negative electrodes (carbon), with perforated separators between them, wound in tight, overlapping spirals. During charge, the ions move in the direction of the negative electrode and during discharge, they move in the direction of the positive electrode. Lithium-ion batteries are lighter and offer far more energy density that their predecessors, nickel-cadmium batteries. They lose roughly 5% of their charging capacity every month, which is a considerable improvement over nickel-cadmium batteries, which could lose 20%. They can also be volatile if not handled and manufactured correctly. Lithium-ion batteries will last longer if they're never fully charged or recharged. A typical iPhone lithium-ion battery should last for approximately 500 cycles. A cycle is a full recharge, which could span over a number of days: You might use 25% of the battery's power on day one and then 75% the next day. Apple told me last year that it even applies artificial intelligence to improve battery management, so those cycles presumably stretch out even more. How you drain and recharge the battery also impacts battery life. Lithium-ion batteries will last longer if they're never fully charged or recharged (this is why, when you buy a battery-powered gadget like a smartphone, it typically ships with about 50% charge, plus or minus 20%). Side reactions in the chemistry increase when you drain the battery to 0% and constantly recharge to 100%. No matter what, though, the charging capacity of lithium-ion batteries will change over time. Like a new car that starts depreciating the moment you drive it off the lot, lithium-ion batteries are continuously losing their charging capacity. This can be confusing since, for the life of your phone, the meter is always showing you something between 0% and 100%. This is not a lie — 100% of 10 hours is 10 hours, just at 100% of the 3 hours you might get four years into the life of your phone is still 3 hours. That percentage is relative. This commonly accepted wisdom about rechargeable batteries still doesn’t explain sudden shutdowns, rapid drains and inaccurate battery life meter reports. Fuzzy science Experts, though, told me that battery life and maintenance is an inexact science. Different lithium-ion batteries, for instance, use different chemistries, which can impact recharge cycles. Professor Donald Sadoway, who studies material sciences at MIT, said most lithium-ion batteries are engineered to go hundreds of cycles and still retain 80% of their capacity. Even the way you measure battery life differs from between phones and manufacturers, since there isn't a way to measure the remaining charge directly. So the readout at the top of your phone could be based on voltage, “by identifying what the voltage is on a battery, you can get a sense of the state of a charge,” said Sadoway. Others uses what’s known as a “voltage plateau,” and some rely on the more difficult-to-integrate measure of the amount of current flowing: If you know the amount of electrical current served over time, you can calculate how much energy has been used, and this, how much is (probably) left. Professor Sadoway has no idea what chemistry or methodology Apple is using. The percentage of battery life we see is an estimate. Other experts I spoke to agreed that the percentage of battery life we see is an estimate. “The only information a phone or laptop can use is the voltage of the battery, but there isn't necessarily a 1-to-1 correspondence between the cell voltage and the amount of energy remaining inside,” wrote Stanford University PhD chemistry student William Gent to me in an email.  Temperature, battery degradation and the amount of power being drawn from the battery can all affect that estimate. “Some more advanced systems may be able to use additional information like this to get a better estimate, but it is always an estimate,” wrote Gent, who owns an iPhone 5S and has experienced rapid discharge, inexplicable battery-meter jumps and sudden shut downs.  “Also,” wrote Gent, “you can't just measure the amount of energy taken out and put in each time, since there is a some hard-to-calculate amount of the total energy that you put in that goes into waste heat (due to inefficiencies in the cell itself) and side reactions. Any error in calculating this non-useful energy put into the battery will add up and result in large errors in SOC [state of charge] determination after repeated cycles,” wrote Gent. Professor Sadoway agrees that there are many reasons why a battery charge meter in the iPhone might be wrong.  “Suppose the phone is actually measuring correctly, but the conversion to the display is flawed. It could be something silly like that,” added Professor Sadoway. Testing During my research, I came across this post, The Ultimate Guide to Solving iPhone Drain, by Scotty Loveless. It offers a nice, step-by-step approach to better, daily iPhone battery performance. I was most intrigued, though, by Loveless’s background. He’s worked as an Apple Store Genius for two years (mostly working on the iPhone 3GS iPhone 4, iPhone 4S and the first wave of iPhone 5 devices). He writes, “The most difficult issue to solve was short iPhone battery life. It was extremely difficult to pinpoint the exact reason why someone had iPhone battery drain.” I wondered if Loveless, who currently works as an Apple consultant at Appinstructor, could offer some insight and maybe help me troubleshoot my own iPhone battery issues. Loveless told me he never saw issues like mine while working at the the Genius Bar “unless the battery was failing.” Results of my iPhone 6 diagnostic tests. No obvious issues. Image: Apple Software Battery life does go pretty fast throughout the day. Image: Apple Software He still has access to his old iPhone diagnostic tools and showed me how he could run them remotely on my iPhone (side note: I had no idea anyone could do this). I did have to share some details from my phone, including the IMEI number. After a few steps and screens on my phone, Loveless was in and he started running a full set of diagnostic tests. We ran the tests with my Apple Smart Case on the iPhone 6 and then again with it off. In both instances, the results showed my battery is not failing and has 423 charge cycles remaining out of, according to Loveless, as many as 1,000. This result is far from conclusive, but it might support the notion that these issues are not related to dying batteries or end-of-life devices. Recharge Stanford’s Gent reminded me, though, that as lithium-ion batteries degrade, “Determination gets less accurate, particularly when you get close to 0% SOC. So your phone or laptop may think, based on the voltage of the battery, that it has 30% left, but then the voltage unexpectedly starts dropping rapidly (because the cell is old and somewhat degraded) and the computer realizes that actually the SOC is lower than originally thought.” This supports my theory that there is actual confusion among the real state of the battery, the hardware’s ability to deliver that information to the operating system and the system’s ability to accurately interpret it. Research teams around the world are working on next-generation lithium battery technologies including lithium air (which has extremely high-energy density) and lithium sulfur (far cheaper than lithium ion), but like lithium ion, these technologies will also degrade over time, which means measurement challenges will remain. Gent thinks that the work to improve battery measurement may, in the long run, pay bigger dividends. “My guess is that the biggest improvement will come from the battery management side rather than the battery tech.” The good news, for what it's worth, is that you're not crazy. Everyone I spoke to, consumers and experts, acknowledge that there is an issue with iPhone battery readings.  MIT’s Sadoway told me an iPhone charge physically cannot be both 10% and 40% within the space of a few seconds or minutes. “It wasn’t both. There’s a broken link in that chain somewhere.” BONUS: Taking underwater photos with your iPhone just got way easier Topics: Apple, Batteries, battery life, Gadgets, iPhone, iPhone 6, iPhone 6S, lithium-ion batteries, Mobile, Tech About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Photo / AP Donald Trump is not used to only being the fifth-richest person in the room, but the then president-elect was grinning nonetheless. Seated with him, at a huge table on the 25th floor of Trump Tower, was the cream of the United States technology industry: the 13 bosses in the room included Google's co-founder Larry Page, Amazon boss Jeff Bezos and Apple chief executive Tim Cook. For the Silicon Valley elite, it was a moment of humility. California had voted by two-to-one in favour of Hillary Clinton and in San Francisco's tech cluster that ratio was undoubtedly higher. Many of the chief executives around the table had criticised Trump (if mostly in private), and he had given as good as he got. At rallies on the campaign trail he had railed against the technology industry for stealing jobs, promised to launch an antitrust investigation into Amazon and said he would force Apple to make its "damn computers" in the US. The sight of those chief executives kissing the ring at the summit in December was almost reminiscent of a defeated army swallowing a peace treaty. The photographers in attendance could not fail to capture the grimaces and pursed lips of Cook, Bezos and Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg. Nonetheless, the meeting appeared to mark a thawing in relations. Trump effusively praised the tech industry and said he would do all he could to ensure its success. Soon after, Oracle's chief executive Safra Catz joined Trump's transition team. Elon Musk and Travis Kalanick, the heads of Tesla and Uber respectively, signed up to his business advisory council. As the inauguration approached, technology executives began to talk about coming to terms with the election result, even acknowledging that tech had been partly responsible for the swell of disenfranchised workers that propelled Trump to power. Companies like Amazon announced plans to hire thousands of new workers in the US. Technology firms hit back But then came the inauguration, and soon after, the executive orders. Trump had promised widespread immigration controls in the run-up to the election, but many were shocked at the abrupt travel ban he signed just seven days after becoming president. He had appeared to seek a more conciliatory tone since and Peter Thiel, the PayPal billionaire who is a rare Trump supporter among the tech elite, had spread the message that Trump was to be taken seriously, but not literally. Continued below. Related Content Zain Ali: Muslim bans can be answered by 'radical hospitality' Fake news is killing people's minds, says Apple boss Tim Cook President Donald Trump says he strongly supports NATO Last month's order, which froze entry to residents of seven largely-Muslim countries, prompted a furious backlash last weekend. Technology executives tripped over themselves to deride the ban. Their comments ranged from the measured - Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said he was "concerned" and Apple's Cook said it was "not a policy we support" - to the aggravated. Reed Hastings, the founder of Netflix, said that "Trump's actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all." Google's co-founder Sergey Brin joined hundreds in protesting at San Francisco airport. "I'm here because I'm a refugee," he told a reporter. On Monday, the words turned to action, when Microsoft and Amazon took legal action against Trump's order, throwing their weight behind a challenge from Washington state. Cook added that Apple could follow, and would at least press the White House hard on the matter. The ban had few supporters across corporate America, but in the pro-immigration, jetsetting and naturally-optimistic tech world, it was anathema. Many dotcom bosses, including Google's Sundar Pichai and Microsoft's Satya Nadella, are immigrants. Silicon Valley's most famous icon, Steve Jobs, was the biological son of a refugee from Syria - one of the seven countries on Trump's blacklist. Outside the boardroom, thousands of programmers come from abroad. Thousands gather at Denver's City Center Park for a rally in support of the Muslim community and to protest President Donald Trump's executive order. Photo / AP Given the outcry among staff, tech companies knew they could not stay silent about the ban. But equally, there were fears that a shaky rapport with the new administration was at risk. Donald Trump is a man who works on deals and relationships, after all. After the drama of the last week, it may appear that tech companies are in for a particularly rough ride over the next four years. In comparison to Barack Obama, who embraced the use of social media in campaigning and sought the approval of Silicon Valley, Trump appears to have little time for technology (aside from a penchant for tweeting from his smartphone, he is said to rarely use a computer). The upside for Silicon Valley But there is an alternative school of thought that a Trump presidency could well be an unexpected boost for the industry, should they be able to swallow their pride to embrace it. The biggest opportunity for several tech giants is the very real prospect of a tax holiday, which will bring trillions of dollars back to the US. Of the estimated $2.6 trillion (£2.1 trillion) that American companies have stashed offshore, the biggest piles of cash are held by tech companies. Apple, Google's parent company Alphabet, Cisco, Oracle and Microsoft - have more than $500bn (£400bn) parked offshore between them. Almost half of that is Apple's alone. For years the company has booked sales from Europe and elsewhere in Ireland in anticipation of a tax holiday that has been a long time coming. Apple revealed last week that it has $230bn, 94pc of the company's entire cash reserves, abroad. Investors salivate at the prospect of a bonanza cash return via dividends or share buybacks, while large acquisitions could also be on the table. Currently, repatriating cash to the US imposes a punitive 35pc tax rate. A tax holiday for America's corporates has been on the table for years, but tensions between Obama's White House and a Republican Congress scuppered any prospect of a deal. Now, with Republicans running all branches of the US government, progress seems more likely. Trump has pledged to cut the 35pc to 10pc Progress could also help defuse a turbulent battle between Apple and the European Union, which has said the company is avoiding billions of taxes thanks to a sweetheart deal with the Irish government. Were Apple to pay taxes on bringing the cash back home, the EU's argument that it is avoiding them would hold less weight. Support abroad Apple is not the only one in Brussels' crosshairs. The European Commission has also charged Google with abusing its dominance on three separate fronts and Facebook with misleading regulators over its $19bn acquisition of WhatsApp. The consistency with which Europe's competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager has targeted Silicon Valley groups has led many inside them to claim that the charges are politically motivated. A defiant, protectionist president fond of dealmaking could well lend increased support to the companies on the international stage, not only in Europe but in China, where many of the biggest internet companies have been shut out by censorship laws, despite Chinese tech groups enjoying the freedom of New York's financial markets. The stock market's "Trump bump" also bodes well for a flurry of potential tech IPOs. Snap Inc, the company behind the messaging app Snapchat, is preparing for a flotation that could value it at as much as $25bn. If it proves successful, others such as Dropbox and Spotify are likely to follow. The US markets were starved of tech listings last year. The S&P 500's 7pc rise since the election, driven by the promise of more infrastructure spending and tax cuts, could prove a welcome catalyst. A bonfire of red tape, meanwhile, could boost start-ups, whose numbers are falling. To exploit the potential benefits of the Trump phenomenon, though, will force America's tech bosses to tread a razor-thin line. Being seen to cosy up to the organisation will play poorly with many employees, not to mention customers: Uber faced a boycott last week when it appeared to undermine a taxi strike during an anti-Trump protest, with anger compounded by Kalanick's position on Trump's business council. The outcry led to Kalanick leaving the role on Thursday. Walking a fine line Any windfall from bringing cash home, however, may come with strings attached. While companies may see buybacks and dividends as the obvious use for their overseas holdings, the Trump administration has different ideas: it is likely to push for tech groups to put their freed-up funds into hiring US workers. Internet companies may well find their day-to-day operations more difficult. The Snowden revelations of 2013 exposed the bulk surveillance carried out by US intelligence services and the extent towards which tech companies must co-operate. The leaks rocked trust in internet groups, but the new regime, which has made security a priority, could introduce measures that expand surveillance at the expense of privacy: Trump publicly criticised Apple over its refusal to decrypt an iPhone belonging to a dead terrorist last year. The tech industry is often accused of playing fast and loose on privacy. Appearing to collaborate with spooks could spark a mainstream backlash. Of all of Silicon Valley's famous names, the one that might have the most to gain from Donald Trump's presidency is Twitter, from which the president fires off constant missives. "It's definitely been fascinating to learn from," Twitter's founder Jack Dorsey said at a recent conference. But when asked about how he feels about the new leader of the free world, one word summed it up: "Complicated". - Daily Telegraph UK Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Have your say 1200 characters left By and large our readers' comments are respectful and courteous.

Kelsey Hubbard reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript It's Apple versus the U.S. Government. The tech giant says it will oppose a court order forcing it to help the FBI break into the iPhone recovered from the San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook. Investigators want to see if there was any communication Rizwan and his wife may have had with Islamic State and other militant groups. The ruling handed down Tuesday by U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, said that Apple must provide "reasonable technical assistance" to investigators seeking to unlock the data on Rizwan's phone. Apple's CEO Tim Cook says the court's demand threatens the security of Apple's customers and has far reaching implications. "The government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers- including tens of millions of American citizens- from sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals." Apple analyst Ben Schachter from Macquarie Research told Reuters that it was surprising the government couldn't unlock the phone on its own and that it had to ask. He said he doesn't see this issue as having a material impact on the company in the short term, but he did add that "It is an incredibly complex issue, and it highlights how technology is moving faster than the laws. Apple has to be careful in terms of how they manage this from a PR standpoint over time as it is so fraught with political implications." Apple shares are flat in early trading.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Facebook has been granted a Patent for a Tilt Scrolling Feature for a Future Smartphone or Tablet | Main | Apple's CEO Pays a Surprise Visit to an Apple Store in France » February 05, 2017 Microsoft is piling in Patent Filings for Augmented Reality to get the Leap on Apple   Back in September Apple's CEO Tim Cook was interviewed by ABC News and he focused on Augmented Reality being Apple's preference over Virtual Reality. Cook told ABC's reporter Roberts that AR "gives the capability for both of us to sit and be very present, talking to each other, but also have other things -- visually -- for both of us to see. Maybe it's something we're talking about, maybe it's someone else here who's not here present but who can be made to appear to be present. There are a lot of really cool things there." While Apple is talking up Augmented Reality (AR), Apple's competitor Microsoft wanted to get the leap on Apple in this emerging market and introduced HoloLens. In today's report we look at how Microsoft's increasing patent filings that at minimum shows us that they're planning to attack AR on multiple fronts with their one common Windows 10 platform and their offshoot for AR systems.    Behind the scenes Microsoft patents are flying in monthly. In late January the U.S. Patent Office published three of Microsoft's patents relating Virtual Reality. The first is titled "Grasping virtual objects in Augmented Reality." The second patent application covers another type of head mounted system than their current HoloLens in a filing titled "Augmented reality system eye relief adjustment mechanism." The third patent application relates to Augmented Reality for a Surface tablet titled "Augmented reality light guide display."   #1: Grasping virtual objects in Augmented Reality   Microsoft's invention under patent application 9,552,673 relates to an augmented reality system which enables grasping of virtual objects and describes such as to stack virtual cubes or to manipulate virtual objects in other ways. In various embodiments a user's hand or another real object is tracked in an augmented reality environment. In examples, the shape of the tracked real object is approximated using at least two different types of particles and the virtual objects are updated according to simulated forces exerted between the augmented reality environment and at least some of the particles. In various embodiments 3D positions of a first one of the types of particles, kinematic particles, are updated according to the tracked real object; and passive particles move with linked kinematic particles without penetrating virtual objects. In some examples a real-time optic flow process is used to track motion of the real object.   Microsoft's patent FIG. 9 is a schematic diagram of an augmented reality system: FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram of a user stacking two virtual cubes using the interactive 3D computer graphics system; FIG. 10 illustrates an exemplary computing-based device for use with the augmented reality systems and techniques.   #2: Augmented Reality Head Mounted System   In Microsoft's second patent application 9,557,569 titled "Augmented reality system eye relief adjustment mechanism," we learn about an alternative head mounted display (HMD) system. Microsoft notes that conventional HMDs employ pivoting hinge and plate mechanisms to adjust eye relief for various user head sizes, which can be bulky, cumbersome to manipulate, and may not accommodate a broad range of user head sizes and eye relief distances.   Failure to accommodate a user's head size can result in the HMD being too tight and causing discomfort, or too loose and moving relative to the user's head during use, negatively impacting the user's experience. Failure to maintain proper eye relief distance can adversely impact the user's ability to properly perceive the augmented reality elements displayed on the display of the HMD.   Microsoft's solution is a head mounted display system that comprises of an adjustable crown band, a crown band circumference adjusting mechanism coupled to the adjustable crown band and configured to adjust a crown band circumference to releasably secure the crown band to the user's crown. The system includes an armature including left and right arms, each of the left and right arms mounted at a respective proximal end to corresponding left and right HMD attachment structures. Further, a display mounted at left and right sides to respective distal ends of the left and right arms, and an eye relief distance adjustment mechanism configured to move the left and right arms in a timed manner toward and away from the crown band along a substantially linear path, to thereby adjust an eye relief distance from the display to an eye of a the user when the crown band is fitted on the crown of the user.   Microsoft's patent FIG. 39 is an isolated perspective view of an armature; FIG. 38 is a perspective view of an armature of an HMD coupled to an HMD display.   #3: Augmented Reality Light Guide Display   Microsoft's third patent application 9,558,590 is titled "Augmented reality light guide display."   Microsoft notes that their invention relates to Augmented Reality light guide display techniques. In one or more implementations, an apparatus includes a housing configured in a hand-held form factor, one or more sensors configured to detect a position and orientation of the housing in three dimensions in a physical environment of the housing, a light guide that is at least partially transparent and supported by the housing, a light engine that is optically coupled to the light guide, and one or more modules disposed within the housing and implemented at least partially in hardware.   The one or more modules are configured to calculate a position and orientation of an augmentation and cause the light engine to output the augmentation for display using the light guide such that the augmentation is viewable concurrently with at least a portion of the physical environment through the light guide.   The input/output module #116 is also illustrated as including an augmented reality module #118 as noted in patent FIG. 1 above. The augmented reality module #118 is representative of functionality of the computing device / Surface tablet to augment a view of the physical surroundings #112 (e.g., the "real world") via a Surface tablet using the display device #110. In the illustrated example, for instance, the Surface tablet is illustrated as being physically positioned in surroundings that include three trees and fingers of the user's hand #106.   The augmented reality module is configured to output an augmentation (e.g., the car 114) to be viewed in conjunction with the physical surroundings. To generate this view and know "where" to place the augmentation, the augmented reality module may leverage a variety of techniques to determine an orientation and/or position of the Surface tablet in relation to the physical surroundings. For example, the augmented reality module may leverage a camera #120 to capture images of the physical surroundings. The augmented reality module may then process the images to locate one or more markers to determine how the Surface tablet is positioned, oriented, moved, and so on.   These markers may take a variety of forms. For instance, the augmented reality module may set one or more view points in the physical surroundings as markers and thus serve as a basis to determine orientation and/or positioning, such as where the trunks of the trees meet the ground. In another instance, the augmented reality module may leverage a view of one or more augmented reality (AR) tags that are physically positioned within the surrounding environment of the Surface tablet. Thus, the items in the physical surroundings may act as a basis to determine where Surface tablet is located as well as how it is oriented.   In the end we're able to see that Microsoft is attacking Augmented Reality on many fronts ranging from new desktop or tablet top computers, through a new AR Headset and bringing AR to Surface tablets. Microsoft knows, or at least believes that this is an area that they could beat Apple to market with.   Earlier last month Patently Apple posted a report titled "Lenovo Adopts Microsoft Platforms to Challenge Android based Headsets and Tablets in 2017 and beyond. The Lenovo HMD system will be based on the Microsoft Windows Holographic platform and it's likely to be the first of many to follow throughout 2017 and 2018 to get the ball rolling winning over developers to Microsoft's new platform over iOS which has yet to publicly address Augmented Reality.   Microsoft is running like the wind to establish a beachhead from which to launch a larger attack against Apple and their operating systems to win over developers and excite the next generation to the Windows platform and away from iOS and macOS. Whether their strategy will prevail is too earlier to call. It's really up to Apple. If they're too slow to market it's going to be harder for them to win over developers. The Augmented Reality market is going to be gathering steam this year and we're hoping that Apple won't be a no-show. Then again, Microsoft had a few year lead on Apple regarding tablets and never quite understood how to make it work. Apple came out with iPad and it became a consumer phenomenon.   So being first to market doesn't always guarantee a company much these days. Nevertheless, you can't rule out a hungry Microsoft going full tilt with the one goal in mind: beat Apple to market to get an earlier lead that they could build on and keep Apple on the periphery as a minor player. This is a focus that Microsoft missed years ago when the iPhone came out which basically brought down their entire kingdom. I think that Microsoft has learned their lesson and will fight Apple on every front going forward which starts with Augmented Reality and other fronts like Cortana based home automation systems. If anything, it'll make the coming market wars for AR and AI a lot of fun to cover over the next few years. Apple and Windows fans have never really liked each other and so the coming tech wars are going to have both camps verbally sparring with each other for some time to come.

Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Feb 5, 2017 at 1:20PM Last week, Brand Finance came out with its annual listing of brand valuations. In a somewhat shocking finding, the consulting group declared that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had lost its supremacy to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google. Alphabet is a phenomenal company with a long track record of innovation, and the Google brand is extremely powerful. Nevertheless, it still isn't in the same league as Apple's brand in terms of total value. Is Apple turning sour? While Brand Finance still rates Apple as the second most valuable brand in the world, it appears to have a fairly negative view of the iPhone maker. According to the recent report: However, Apple's evangelists are beginning to lose their faith. The snaking queues of early adopters have shrunk almost to the point of invisibility. Apple has failed to maintain its technological advantage and has repeatedly disillusioned its advocates with tweaks when material changes were expected. Put simply, Apple has over-exploited the goodwill of its customers, it has failed to generate significant revenues from newer products such as the Apple Watch and cannot demonstrate that genuinely innovative technologies desired by consumers are in the pipeline. Its brand has lost its luster and must now compete on an increasingly level playing field not just with traditional rival Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), but a slew of Chinese brands such as Huawei and OnePlus in the smartphone market, Apple's key source of profitability. As a result of this assessment, Brand Finance reduced its estimate of the Apple brand's value by 27% year over year, to $107.1 billion. Meanwhile, it estimated Google's brand value at $109.5 billion, up 24% from $88.2 billion a year ago. Brand Finance cited Google's dominance in search, among other things, to justify the big increase in its brand value. Consumers are paying more and more for iPhones Brand Finance's declining opinion of the Apple brand is contradicted by consumers' willingness to pay more and more for iPhones. Last quarter, Apple reported record quarterly iPhone sales of 78.3 million units. Even more impressively, the average selling price (ASP) reached a new record of $695. The iPhone's ASP hit a new record last quarter. Image source: Apple. In the same quarter two years ago, right after Apple released the hugely popular iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the iPhone's ASP had surged 8% year over year, to $687. Apple's ability to continue growing that ASP over the past two years, despite facing stiff foreign exchange headwinds in both years, is a testament to the massive value of its brand. Indeed, the cost of high-quality smartphones is coming down. Leaving aside Samsung, several Chinese manufacturers have become known for designing high-quality smartphones and selling them at near-breakeven prices in recent years. Apple's ability to command a huge price premium over competitors -- which extends beyond smartphones to PCs and (to a lesser extent) tablets -- indicates that its brand is as strong as ever. Apple is a profit machine According to Brand Finance, Apple has failed to maintain a technological lead over Samsung and other rivals. In fact, many tech pundits have argued in recent years that Samsung has overtaken Apple in terms of innovation. Assuming that the two companies are on a relatively even technological footing, they should be able to produce roughly similar earnings. However, that's not even close to being true. Last quarter, Apple barely retook the lead in terms of smartphone shipments with 78.3 million, compared to 77.5 million shipments for Samsung, according to Strategy Analytics. Yet Samsung's mobile-division operating profit totaled just $2.1 billion for the quarter. By contrast, Apple's operating profit was more than 10 times higher at $23.4 billion. On a full-year basis -- or looking just at the smartphone business -- Apple's advantage is somewhat smaller. But any way you slice it, Apple generates many times more profit than Samsung. (In its most recent fiscal year, Apple's operating profit was $60 billion, compared to about $10 billion for Samsung's mobile division.) If Apple doesn't have superior technology relative to Samsung, its brand must be doing most of the heavy lifting to generate $50 billion of additional operating profit on an annual basis. That's more than double Alphabet's total annual operating profit of $23.7 billion. Google may be a powerful brand. However, it doesn't come close to the value of the Apple brand, which has turned the traditionally low-margin technology hardware business into a long-term cash cow that churns out tens of billions of dollars of profit every year.

Although 2016 looked relatively poor for Apple, the makers of the iPhone managed to end the year soaring. A large portion of Q4’s great figures came from iPhones sales and the revamped MacBooks. Since product upgrades look like a sure way to enhance appeal, we can expect a whole range of buffed up Apple gadgets to come along in 2017. Today, LearnBonds takes a look at the incoming Apple Watch Series 3 and features that fans can confidently look forward to in the coming months. While the existing Apple Watch lineup comes in squarish designs, popular rivals like the Samsung Gear 2, Huawei Watch and Moto 360 from Motorola come in circular designs. These wrist gadgets also make use of Google’s Android operating system. However, analysts claim it is their conventional appearances that make them more approachable. Apple still leads the smartwatch space despite the rise of industry rivals. Although, it would seems as if the demand for a more conventional-looking wrist gadget can no longer be ignored. This year could see the Cupertino tech major roll out a circular Apple Watch in order to boost its adoption. Round Watch doesn’t make sense The New Yorker questioned Apple’s Jony Ive — head of design — about whether the firm intends to make a round digital watch some time in the future. The design chief responded by saying it simply didn’t seem appropriate for that sort of product. “When a huge part of the function is lists, a circle just doesn’t make any sense,” Ive told the paper. True to this stance, the square design can still be seen in the second edition of the Watch series, despite the demands for a conventional-looking wrist piece. In the months building up to the Watch Series 2, rumors had fans looking forward to a circular faced gadget. Alas, the firm held its ground and the device was revealed in the same shape as its older sibling.   To see a list of high yielding CDs go here.   It does look like Apple intends to launch a round Apple Watch though. The company already has round watch patent in its arsenal. It was filed in June 2015 — the same year that saw the first Apple Watch series unveiled. Allegedly, Apple is interested in adding an array of pixel columns and rows, each varying in length. This would “save space and reduce crowding” according to one report. It is possible that the firm is only waiting for the novelty of the square-like design to fade. Modular Watch links Apple looks keen to add key functions to its watch links. Recently discovered, a patent filed by the company shows an modular system of accessories in the form of watch joints. Picture links dedicated to battery power, biometric sensors, connectivity, camera functions, haptic feedback and speakers. These would effectively make up the watch’s metal band. The patent was initially heard of in March 2016. It includes standardized links that hold working electronic components. These modular individual devices are made to appear and work as normal watch links, too. They will be attachable via some flexible conductive material similar to those in the Apple Link Bracelet. Apple defies smartwatch trend Industry research has produces some concerning statistics about global smartwatch sales. The International Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker was just updated it Q3 2016 results. They suggest Apple Watch sales were down more than 71 percent during the three months leading to Sept. 30. That is compared to the same time space in 2016. Reportedly, the third quarter of 2015 saw had around 4 million Apple Watch sales. That is an impressive figure considering the Watch only landed in the 2nd quarter that year. IWQWDT claims Apple only manages to pull in 1.1 million watch sales during the 2016 September quarter. CEO Tim Cook has disputed these claims though. He claims Watch sales have been “great”and are set to do ever better this holiday season.” “Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,” Cook told Reuters last year. True to his world, the company saw a record-worthy Q4. Cooks say the sales growth goes well beyond expectations. He also said the Watch sell-through seen in the first week of holiday shopping “was greater than any week in the product’s history”. The company projected that the past holiday quarter would be the Watch’s best quarter since its launch last year. Apple Watch is a great seller Apple is yet to give the public details about the Watch’s actual sales performance. This is mostly done to keep competitors in the dark. At quarter revenue calls, the company groups Watch sales with other ‘accessories’. Last September saw the unveiling of the latest Watch, dubbed Series 2. The iPhone maker also collaborated with sportswear giant Nike to produce a new Nike+ edition of the Watch. It is speculated that both these items pulled in large sales numbers this Christmas season. The last few days saw Tim Cook and his company share their three month earnings leading up to December 31. The Christmas quarter revealed massive gains with more than $17 billion in overall profits. Apple Inc. remains at the head of smartwatch sales worldwide. The Apple Watch is also the globe’s second leading watch brand by revenue. First place still goes to Rolex in that regard. It is interesting to know that Apple has a round design stashed away in its back pocket. The secured watch link patent is equally as exciting. Maybe 2017 will be the year these designs get put to use. What are your thoughts on the Apple Watch? Is the product in dire need of an upgrade, or can the makers of the gadget hold off from upgrading it this year? What features would you like to see on the next edition?

Prior to Super Bowl XVIII, nobody watched the game "just for the commercials"—but one epic TV spot, directed by sci-fi legend Ridley Scott, changed all that. Read on for the inside story of the commercial that rocked the world of advertising, even though Apple's Board of Directors didn't want to run it at all. THE AD If you haven't seen it, here's a fuzzy YouTube version: "WHY 1984 WON'T BE LIKE 1984" The tagline "Why 1984 Won't Be Like '1984'" references George Orwell's 1949 novel 1984, which envisioned a dystopian future, controlled by a televised "Big Brother." The tagline was written by Brent Thomas and Steve Hayden of the ad firm Chiat\Day in 1982, and the pair tried to sell it to various companies (including Apple, for the Apple II computer) but were turned down repeatedly. When Steve Jobs heard the pitch in 1983, he was sold—he saw the Macintosh as a "revolutionary" product, and wanted advertising to match. Jobs saw IBM as Big Brother, and wanted to position Apple as the world's last chance to escape IBM's domination of the personal computer industry. The Mac was scheduled to launch in late January of 1984, a week after the Super Bowl. IBM already held the nickname "Big Blue," so the parallels, at least to Jobs, were too delicious to miss. Thomas and Hayden wrote up the story of the ad: we see a world of mind-controlled, shuffling men all in gray, staring at a video screen showing the face of Big Brother droning on about "information purification directives." A lone woman clad in vibrant red shorts and a white tank-top (bearing a Mac logo) runs from riot police, dashing up an aisle towards Big Brother. Just before being snatched by the police, she flings a sledgehammer at Big Brother's screen, smashing him just after he intones "We shall prevail!" Big Brother's destruction frees the minds of the throng, who quite literally see the light, flooding their faces now that the screen is gone. A mere eight seconds before the one-minute ad concludes, a narrator briefly mentions the word "Macintosh," in a restatement of that original tagline: "On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won't be like '1984.'" An Apple logo is shown, and then we're out—back to the game. In 1983, in a presentation about the Mac, Jobs introduced the ad to a cheering audience of Apple employees: "... It is now 1984. It appears IBM wants it all. Apple is perceived to be the only hope to offer IBM a run for its money. Dealers, initially welcoming IBM with open arms, now fear an IBM-dominated and -controlled future. They are increasingly turning back to Apple as the only force that can ensure their future freedom. IBM wants it all and is aiming its guns on its last obstacle to industry control: Apple. Will Big Blue dominate the entire computer industry? The entire information age? Was George Orwell right about 1984?" After seeing the ad for the first time, the Apple audience totally freaked out (jump to about the 5-minute mark to witness the riotous cheering). SKINHEADS, A DISCUS THROWER, AND A SCI-FI DIRECTOR Chiat\Day hired Ridley Scott, whose 1982 sci-fi film Blade Runner had the dystopian tone they were looking for (and Alien wasn't so bad either). Scott filmed the ad in London, using actual skinheads playing the mute bald men—they were paid $125 a day to sit and stare at Big Brother; those who still had hair were paid to shave their heads for the shoot. Anya Major, a discus thrower and actress, was cast as the woman with the sledgehammer largely because she was actually capable of wielding the thing. Mac programmer Andy Hertzfeld wrote an Apple II program "to flash impressive looking numbers and graphs on [Big Brother's] screen," but it's unclear whether his program was used for the final film. The ad cost a shocking $900,000 to film, plus Apple booked two premium slots during the Super Bowl to air it—carrying an airtime cost of more than $1 million. WHAT EXECUTIVES AT APPLE THOUGHT Although Jobs and his marketing team (plus the assembled throng at his 1983 internal presentation) loved the ad, Apple's Board of Directors hated it. After seeing the ad for the first time, board member Mike Markkula suggested that Chiat\Day be fired, and the remainder of the board were similarly unimpressed. Then-CEO John Sculley recalled the reaction after the ad was screened for the group: "The others just looked at each other, dazed expressions on their faces ... Most of them felt it was the worst commercial they had ever seen. Not a single outside board member liked it." Sculley instructed Chiat\Day to sell off the Super Bowl airtime they had purchased, but Chiat\Day principal Jay Chiat quietly resisted. Chiat had purchased two slots—a 60-second slot in the third quarter to show the full ad, plus a 30-second slot later on to repeat an edited-down version. Chiat sold only the 30-second slot and claimed it was too late to sell the longer one. By disobeying his client's instructions, Chiat cemented Apple's place in advertising history. When Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak heard that the ad was in trouble, he offered to pony up half the airtime costs himself, saying, "I asked how much it was going to cost, and [Steve Jobs] told me $800,000. I said, 'Well, I'll pay half of it if you will.' I figured it was a problem with the company justifying the expenditure. I thought an ad that was so great a piece of science fiction should have its chance to be seen." But Woz didn't have to shell out the money; the executive team finally decided to run a 100-day advertising extravaganza for the Mac's launch, starting with the Super Bowl ad—after all, they had already paid to shoot it and were stuck with the airtime. WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE THOUGHT When the ad aired, controversy erupted—viewers either loved or hated the ad, and it spurred a wave of media coverage that involved news shows replaying the ad as part of covering it, leading to estimates of an additional $5 million in "free" airtime for the ad. All three national networks, plus countless local markets, ran news stories about the ad. "1984" become a cultural event, and served as a blueprint for future Apple product launches. The marketing logic was brilliantly simple: create an ad campaign that sparked controversy (for example, by insinuating that IBM was like Big Brother), and the media will cover your launch for free, amplifying the message. The full ad famously ran once during the Super Bowl XVIII (on January 22, 1984), but it also ran the month prior—on December 31, 1983, TV station operator Tom Frank ran the ad on KMVT at the last possible time slot before midnight, in order to qualify for 1983's advertising awards.* (Any awards the ad won would mean more media coverage.) Apple paid to screen the ad in movie theaters before movie trailers, further heightening anticipation for the Mac launch. In addition to all that, the 30-second version was aired across the country after its debut on the Super Bowl. Chiat\Day adman Steve Hayden recalled: "We ran a 30- second version of '1984' in the top 10 U.S. markets, plus, in an admittedly childish move, in an 11th market—Boca Raton, Florida, headquarters for IBM's PC division." Mac team member Andy Hertzfeld ended his remembrance of the ad by saying: "A week after the Macintosh launch, Apple held its January board meeting. The Macintosh executive staff was invited to attend, not knowing what to expect. When the Mac people entered the room, everyone on the board rose and gave them a standing ovation, acknowledging that they were wrong about the commercial and congratulating the team for pulling off a fantastic launch. Chiat\Day wanted the commercial to qualify for upcoming advertising awards, so they ran it once at 1 AM at a small television station in Twin Falls, Idaho, KMVT, on December 15, 1983 [incorrect; see below for an update on this -ed]. And sure enough it won just about every possible award, including best commercial of the decade. Twenty years later it's considered one of the most memorable television commercials ever made." THE AWFUL 1985 FOLLOW-UP A year later, Apple again employed Chiat\Day to make a blockbuster ad for their Macintosh Office product line, which was basically a file server, networking gear, and a laser printer. Directed by Ridley Scott's brother Tony, the new ad was called "Lemmings," and featured blindfolded businesspeople whistling an out-of-tune version of Snow White's "Heigh-Ho" as they followed each other off a cliff (referencing the myth of lemming suicide). Jobs and Sculley didn't like the ad, but Chiat\Day convinced them to run it, pointing out that the board hadn't liked the last ad either. But unlike the rousing, empowering message of the "1984" ad, "Lemmings" directly insulted business customers who had already bought IBM computers. It was also weirdly boring—when it was aired at the Super Bowl (with Jobs and Sculley in attendance), nobody really reacted. The ad was a flop, and Apple even proposed running a printed apology in The Wall Street Journal. Jay Chiat shot back, saying that if Apple apologized, Chiat would buy an ad on the next page, apologizing for the apology. It was a mess: 20-YEAR ANNIVERSARY In 2004, the ad was updated for the launch of the iPod. The only change was that the woman with the hammer was now listening to an iPod, which remained clipped to her belt as she ran. You can watch that version too: FURTHER READING Chiat\Day adman Lee Clow gave an interview about the ad, covering some of this material. Check out Mac team member Andy Hertzfeld's excellent first-person account of the ad.

I do have an iPhone 6, but if this is spam, how do they know? I am temporarily ignoring this. What do I do? For years, online criminals have been trying variations of the account-security email for Apple’s iMessages, iTunes and iCloud services to lure recipients into clicking on malicious links or providing Apple ID account information. By including the name of the iPhone model in the message, the sender is hoping to get your attention with specifics. Adding the name of a model still in widespread use broadens the potential audience for the message. Even if the return address on the message says it is from Apple (or one of its services), you can usually see the account it really came from by tapping the sender’s name in the header. The next screen shows the actual address. If it is clearly not from Apple, forward the message to reportphishing@apple.com.For more information, search Apple’s support site for its page of other tips for dealing with suspicious email. If you think that you may have been hacked, the site has guidelines for compromised Apple ID accounts, along with instructions for seeing a list of the devices that are using your Apple ID credentials. Online criminals target Apple ID accounts because they often are linked to credit cards for iTunes or App Store purchases (as are Amazon accounts, Google accounts, bank accounts and so on). Shoring up your personal security with two-step verification and changing your password on a regular basis can help keep your account secure — for your Apple ID and any other ecommerce or social media services you use. Q: How do I stop Windows 10 from rebooting itself after it automatically installs a software update? I find it does this at night. The current version of the operating system — the Windows 10 Anniversary Update — allows you to block out the time of day you normally use the computer and prevent those automatic restarts that happen after new software is installed. You can set up to 12 “active hours” when Windows is not permitted to restart itself, so if you tend to work on the computer at night, you can set different active hours and let the PC restart itself during the day. (Some test versions of Windows 10 allow 18 active hours, an option that may appear in future system updates.) To set your active hours, go to the Start Menu and choose Settings, or just press the Windows and I keys on the keyboard. On the Settings screen, select Update & Security and then Windows Update. On the Update Settings area, tap or click “Change active hours.” On the Active Hours screen, set the start and end times in which you want to avoid restarts and click the Save button. If Windows has installed new updates and has a restart pending that you just want to get out of the way, you can temporarily bypass your active hours settings with a preferred restart time. To do that, go back to the Settings app to Update & Security to Windows Update, and then select Restart Options. On the next screen, set a time for the PC to restart. You can also just get it over with by selecting the Restart Now option on the Windows Update screen.   Tweet Go to Top Videos 'PM Modi likes peeping into others' bathroom':...

With Apple’s next iPhone seeing even more fevered speculation this week, a long-time display expert offers his predictions.   Call it the “iPhone 8,” or “10th anniversary iPhone” or what some analysts on Wall Street refer to as the “iPhone X” -- with "X" referring to the roman numeral 10 -- expectations for Apple’s next phone are high after the company turned in a record quarter this week, selling more iPhones than ever. Popular Searches Homeland Security Corp HSCC ▼ 0.0090 -0.0014 -13.29% DNO ASA DTNOF ▼ 1.00 -0.04 -3.71% IGM Financial Inc IGIFF ▲ 31.00 +0.63 +2.07% Michael Kors Holdings Ltd KORS ▲ 38.38 +0.11 +0.29% The centerpiece of that future phone, due later this year, will likely be an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display, according Raymond Soneira, a display expert who heads DisplayMate Technologies and published a report this week with his thoughts on Apple’s future phone. Soneira, who holds a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Princeton University, founded DisplayMate Technologies in 1989, and has advised many of the world's leading device manufacturers “Most of the iPhone 8 OLED hardware display [specifications] will undoubtedly be very similar to the OLED displays on Galaxy Note7, and particularly the upcoming Galaxy S8,” Soneira said in his report. The S8 refers to Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy smartphone. An iPhone using an OLED display -- which offers some critical advantages over liquid crystal displays (LCDs) -- would be a first for Apple, which has used LCDs exclusively to date on its iPhones.  “At least in 2017, everyone’s essentially using the same hardware,” Soneira told Fox News in a phone interview, referring to the fact that Samsung is the only viable high-volume supplier of high-quality OLED smartphone displays and Apple will likely have no choice but to use Samsung OLED displays for the foreseeable future. And that is not just Soneira’s opinion -- Asia-based market research analysts have been saying the same thing for months. The challenge for Apple is that the switch to an OLED display is fraught with complexity. By using an OLED display, not only does the mechanical engineering change but so does the electronics and the batteries -- and the software tied to the display has to be rewritten.  That also presents Apple with an opportunity to set itself apart from the competition. “It will be particularly interesting to see how all the Smartphone manufacturers will differentiate their similar OLED display hardware with differing and innovative software and firmware,” Soneira said in his report. Firmware refers to software that handles certain basic “low-level” control of the hardware. This year expect only one high-end OLED iPhone The conventional wisdom among some analysts and experts is that Apple will only sell one pricey, high-end OLED iPhone model this year. That’s because Samsung won’t be able to supply the tens of millions displays per quarter that Apple needs for multiple models. The South Korean electronics giant must sell its OLED displays to other large smartphone customers while also meeting the in-house demand for its popular Galaxy phones. Soneira did offer some thoughts in his report about what the future OLED iPhone might look like. “With a curved screen OLED, the iPhone display will almost certainly be bezel and border free to the outside edges, and fill all or almost all of the entire front view edge-to-edge,” he said, referring to a display design that has virtually no borders (bezel), which would be a stark contrast to the current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Soneira continued. “With rumors predicting that the home button, fingerprint sensor, ambient light and proximity sensors will be incorporated within the display.” The question that nobody can answer yet, is what will Apple’s secret sauce be. “What’s going to make an OLED phone shine is all of the fancy software, firmware, and OS (operating system) stuff that make the phone useful and nice to use,” Soneira told Fox News.

Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Feb 5, 2017 at 1:20PM Last week, Brand Finance came out with its annual listing of brand valuations. In a somewhat shocking finding, the consulting group declared that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had lost its supremacy to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google. Alphabet is a phenomenal company with a long track record of innovation, and the Google brand is extremely powerful. Nevertheless, it still isn't in the same league as Apple's brand in terms of total value. Is Apple turning sour? While Brand Finance still rates Apple as the second most valuable brand in the world, it appears to have a fairly negative view of the iPhone maker. According to the recent report: However, Apple's evangelists are beginning to lose their faith. The snaking queues of early adopters have shrunk almost to the point of invisibility. Apple has failed to maintain its technological advantage and has repeatedly disillusioned its advocates with tweaks when material changes were expected. Put simply, Apple has over-exploited the goodwill of its customers, it has failed to generate significant revenues from newer products such as the Apple Watch and cannot demonstrate that genuinely innovative technologies desired by consumers are in the pipeline. Its brand has lost its luster and must now compete on an increasingly level playing field not just with traditional rival Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), but a slew of Chinese brands such as Huawei and OnePlus in the smartphone market, Apple's key source of profitability. As a result of this assessment, Brand Finance reduced its estimate of the Apple brand's value by 27% year over year, to $107.1 billion. Meanwhile, it estimated Google's brand value at $109.5 billion, up 24% from $88.2 billion a year ago. Brand Finance cited Google's dominance in search, among other things, to justify the big increase in its brand value. Consumers are paying more and more for iPhones Brand Finance's declining opinion of the Apple brand is contradicted by consumers' willingness to pay more and more for iPhones. Last quarter, Apple reported record quarterly iPhone sales of 78.3 million units. Even more impressively, the average selling price (ASP) reached a new record of $695. The iPhone's ASP hit a new record last quarter. Image source: Apple. In the same quarter two years ago, right after Apple released the hugely popular iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, the iPhone's ASP had surged 8% year over year, to $687. Apple's ability to continue growing that ASP over the past two years, despite facing stiff foreign exchange headwinds in both years, is a testament to the massive value of its brand. Indeed, the cost of high-quality smartphones is coming down. Leaving aside Samsung, several Chinese manufacturers have become known for designing high-quality smartphones and selling them at near-breakeven prices in recent years. Apple's ability to command a huge price premium over competitors -- which extends beyond smartphones to PCs and (to a lesser extent) tablets -- indicates that its brand is as strong as ever. Apple is a profit machine According to Brand Finance, Apple has failed to maintain a technological lead over Samsung and other rivals. In fact, many tech pundits have argued in recent years that Samsung has overtaken Apple in terms of innovation. Assuming that the two companies are on a relatively even technological footing, they should be able to produce roughly similar earnings. However, that's not even close to being true. Last quarter, Apple barely retook the lead in terms of smartphone shipments with 78.3 million, compared to 77.5 million shipments for Samsung, according to Strategy Analytics. Yet Samsung's mobile-division operating profit totaled just $2.1 billion for the quarter. By contrast, Apple's operating profit was more than 10 times higher at $23.4 billion. On a full-year basis -- or looking just at the smartphone business -- Apple's advantage is somewhat smaller. But any way you slice it, Apple generates many times more profit than Samsung. (In its most recent fiscal year, Apple's operating profit was $60 billion, compared to about $10 billion for Samsung's mobile division.) If Apple doesn't have superior technology relative to Samsung, its brand must be doing most of the heavy lifting to generate $50 billion of additional operating profit on an annual basis. That's more than double Alphabet's total annual operating profit of $23.7 billion. Google may be a powerful brand. However, it doesn't come close to the value of the Apple brand, which has turned the traditionally low-margin technology hardware business into a long-term cash cow that churns out tens of billions of dollars of profit every year.

These supposed features could potentially give the Samsung smartphone an edge over the iPhone 8.  ( Kārlis Dambrāns | Flickr ) Advertisement Both Samsung and Apple are poised to unleash the successors of the GalaxtyS7 and iPhone 7 dubbed the Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8, respectively, in 2017. Judging by the innumerable rumors and leaks pertaining to the two devices, premium handsets look set to house ground breaking features and could be game changers. Here's a look at some of the supposed features for the Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8 that could potentially draw consumers to the two flagship smartphones. Iris Scanner Smartphone security is an increasing concern and to up the safety of a handset so that a user's sensitive data remains away from prying eyes, many OEMs have already deployed a fingerprint scanner. Both the Galaxy S7 and iPhone 8 use biometrics, but the arrival of the Galaxy S8 may take things up a notch thanks to the rumored availability of an iris scanner. Basically, the smartphone conducts a retina scan of the user before unlocking the handset. The now discontinued Galaxy Note 7 was equipped with this feature and it will not come as a surprise if Samsung introduces the iris scanner on the Galaxy S8 as well. Rumors also hint at the iPhone 8 being equipped with the functionality, but whether Apple will save it for a different model remains to be seen. Desktop Mode Rumors suggest that Samsung will be incorporating a new feature in its 2017 flagship smartphones dubbed the "Desktop Mode," which will be apparently similar to Continuum from Microsoft. The feature will basically allow the user to connect his or her Galaxy S8 to a computer monitor and peripherals to enjoy a smooth desktop computing experience.  Tech enthusiasts are hailing this supposed feature from Samsung's as a game changer. This feature may also give the Galaxy S8 and edge over the iPhone 8. Beast Mode Samsung is also expected to deploy a novel feature for the Galaxy S8, which the iPhone 8 may not have - the Beast Mode. The trademark for the Beast Mode was applied for in December 2016 by Samsung and could be a power optimization setting. The feature could put the Galaxy S8 on a higher gear, providing the users with maximum computing power. By sound of it, the feature may come in handy for gamers. MicroSD Card Support The Samsung Galaxy S8 is also expected to offer microSD support, which could allow users to expand the memory of the device to and 2 TB. Apple has traditionally desisted from providing expandable memory support and it seems unlikely that things would change with the arrival of the iPhone 8. While the iPhone 8, like the iPhone 7, may come in a 256 GB option, the base version of the Galaxy S8 may also supersede on storage support count. The base version of the Galaxy S7 was 32 GB and even if the Galaxy S8 sticks to this option, the additional 2 TB support clearly gives it an edge. 3.5mm Audio Jack Samsung's Galaxy S8 is expected to sport a 3.5mm jack, which would ensure that users have easy and smooth access to music. Apple skipped the headphone jack for the iPhone 7 and may stick to the same convention for the iPhone 8. Those using the iPhone 7 need to purchase the wireless AirPods to listen to music, which is an additional expense. While the above-mentioned features may give the Galaxy S8 an edge over the iPhone 8, it must be reiterated that this is mere speculation and some of the functionalities may not even make it to the Samsung smartphone. Moreover, Apple too is rumored to be working on a slew of features such as facial recognition, wireless charging and gesture recognition, which could tilt the scales in the iPhone 8's favor - subject to them making their way to the handset. Although it may seem that Samsung has the upper hand, it's too early to dismiss the iPhone 8 from the race.

The consumer electronics giant is reportedly working on a prototype device that will also see the light of day before the calendar year is out. Dubbed the iPhone X, this next generation smartphone will hugely impact on the marketplace later this year. rhysadams / Pixabay Analysts believe that the X included in the branding of this smartphone will refer to the tenth generation via the Roman numeral for ten. This third device in the iPhone 8 series will effectively acknowledge the importance of this decade of smartphone supremacy. Apple will want to put out something outstanding to mark ten years since the first iPhone began to completely change the way that many of us interact with the world. iPhone X: OLED central While the iPhone X will be characterized by several new features, central to these will be the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display that is increasingly linked with the next generation Apple smartphone. Whether this will be unique to the iPhone X remains to be seen, as it has been suggested that OLED could be included in all iPhone 8 models. But Apple is expected to take the lead from Samsung in this department, with analysts suggesting that the iPhone 8 OLED display specifications will be extremely similar to the doomed Galaxy Note 7, and particularly the forthcoming Galaxy S8. Apple is keen to embrace OLED as it offers critical advantages over the LCD technology that it has relied on for previous iPhone releases. In particular, it is thought that OLED is kinder on battery life than its LCD equivalents, and this would be particularly welcome for Apple as it has perennially struggled in this department. There was good news for Apple recently, with sales of the Apple Watch sales spiking significantly. This suggests that smartwatches are beginning to establish themselves as mainstream devices, and considering that Apple controls the overwhelming majority of the smartwatch marketplace, this could perhaps take some of the onus away from the iPhone 8 and iPhone X. Revenue generator Nonetheless, the iPhone continues to generate over 60 percent of Apple revenue in any given calendar year, and this will not change with the next generation iPhone. So the pressure on the consumer electronics giants to deliver something outstanding is multiplied, particularly considering the recent sales figures have been, shall we say, lukewarm. However, despite the fact that there are clear motivations for Apple to include OLED in this mooted iPhone X, the fact remains that switching to this display technology will pose technical problems. This will fundamentally change the mechanical engineering involved in the iPhone 8, while the electronics, batteries and software tied to the display will all need to be taken into consideration. This obviously presents a serious logistical problem, even for a company of the size and scope of Apple. But the Californian corporation has such an outstanding reputation for producing its trademark hardware and software combination that it seems likely that this hurdle will be traversed by the time that the iPhone X emerges. Indeed, many analuyst believe that the switch to OLED in fact presents a massive opportunity for Apple. Each of the smartphone manufacturers will attempt to differentiate their similar display hardware with differing and innovative software and firmware, and with Apple needing to rewrite aspects of iOS anyway, there is no doubt that this will form a major part of the strategy. While iOS is undoubtedly a outstanding operating system, considering the raft of new features anticipated for the iPhone 8 and iPhone X generation, it is obvious that there needs to be severe tweaking of the code. No OLED for iPhone 8 It has also been suggested by some experts on Apple’s operations that it will be impossible for Apple to include OLED in all iPhone models. This is due to costs associated with switching to this pricier technology, while it is also suggested that it will be difficult for Samsung to supply the tens of millions of displays per quarter that Apple would require for multiple OLED models. Of course, Samsung must also produce displays for its own products. Apple is likely to produce its first ever curved screen smartphone when it the iPhone 8 is released, the introduction of OLED is imminent, the corporation also reportedly plans to significantly redesign the iPhone unit, while a series of new features including the Home button, fingerprint sensor, ambient light and proximity sensors being incorporated within the display, along with wireless charging…that adds up to a pretty significant departure from previous iPhone releases. A challenge for Apple, but an exciting proposition for iPhone consumers.

ISACA's half-year, half-price offer Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com AirPods Review: Best Wireless Earbuds for Apple Devices? By Samuel Gibbs PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 05 2017 When Apple removed the traditional headphone socket from its latest iPhone, part of the rationale was that wireless headphones were now coming into the mainstream. And Apple had its own player in this field, its AirPods. But then there was an unexpected delay in their launch, raising fears over technical issues. Now they’re finally here, are they worth the price tag? The AirPods are not the first wireless earbuds on the market, but until the start of 2016 they all had a cable joining the right and left earbud. Now there’s a new breed of entirely wireless earbuds, but most of them don’t really work. In my testing, only Bragi’s the Headphone and Jabra’s Elite Sport wireless earbuds can keep a connection between themselves. Apple reckons it’s got that particular problem licked with a new processing chip called the W1, which regulates the connection between the earbuds and to the smartphone, tablet or computer. EarPods or AirPods? If you’ve ever seen a set of Apple’s iPhone earphones, the EarPods, you know what the AirPods look and feel like. If you took the EarPods, cut the cables off, made the stalks a little thicker and ever so slightly changed that odd bud shape, you’d have the AirPods. It’s a conscious design decision that you’re either going to like or hate. They perch in your ear, unlike isolating so-called canal buds that wedge themselves in your ear canal, with the stalks going down past your earlobes. The fit is closer to an open, traditional earphone from the early 2000s than the modern canal-fitting earphone. As such, they don’t isolate you from the world around you at all. You can hear everything, even if you push them hard into your ear. As a consequence you have to have the music really quite loud to be able to hear it if you’re trying to block out the rest of your train, plane or bus commute. At work in an office, they offer almost no refuge from the chatter of those around you. But, compared to the EarPods, they leak a lot less sound. So while you can hear everything, you won’t be subjecting those around you to an impromptu tinny disco. They still bleed a little at high volume, but Apple’s done the rest of the world a favour by stopping one of the most annoying things of a modern commute -- other people’s crappy music. Fit Is Up to the Shape of Your Outer Ear The fit is relatively comfortable, but I found they hurt my ears a little after about an hour wearing them. The AirPods are very light and do not drop out of my ears, no matter how hard I shake my head, but neither would a set of EarPods without the cable dragging them down. Running while wearing them in the cold wasn’t a problem, but as I became sweaty they started to slip back from my ear canal and became much quieter. They didn’t come out but how secure they are in your ear relies heavily on the shape of your outer ear. For some people I asked to try out the AirPods, they dropped out of their ears almost immediately after they started getting up from a seat or turning their head. If the EarPods fit and stay in your ear, the AirPods will likely fit as well or slightly better without the drag of the cable. If they don’t you won’t have any luck with the AirPods. It’s also worth noting that the stalks of the AirPods bash into medium-sized shape earrings, meaning that you might have change your style to accommodate them. Audio Upgrade over the EarPods The AirPods sound surprisingly good given the lack of a proper seal in the ear, with relatively full bass and much less of the punishing treble that’s the hallmark of the EarPods. Like most other wireless earbuds, they’re nowhere near as big a step up in quality as a set of wired earbuds costing similar. The AirPods definitely sound better than the EarPods, with more bass than Bragi’s the Headphone, but less separation and distinction between instruments and sounds. Call quality was also pretty good. Although I had to crank up the volume to hear the other end, they could hear me loud and clear even when walking along a congested London street. Lack of Controls Apple’s gone for simplicity with the AirPods, which means no buttons. In fact, there’s only one thing you can do with them once they’re in your lugholes: double tap them to either fire up Siri or pause or play music, depending on what you’ve got as default in settings (when connected to a non-Apple device the only option is pause/play). Connected to an Apple device, when you take one or both out of your ears the music pauses and resumes when you put it back in. Volume adjustment, track skipping or anything else has to either be done via Siri, which is incredibly tedious and requires a good internet connection to work, or by pulling out your smartphone. It feels a bit like Apple built the AirPods for people who own Apple Watches, because volume and play controls can be done via the wrist. Most other wireless earbuds have buttons or gestures for play controls and volume at the very least, and not having even tap gestures to skip tracks and change the volume seems like a backward step. Connection The AirPods make and maintain a strong connection to other Apple products. To pair them all you need to do is open the case that they come in close to an iPhone for the first time and confirm that you want to connect them. That pairing is then shared via iCloud to your other Apple devices, should you use iCloud and have an iPad or a Mac. Switching between devices is as simple as prompting a connection from the tablet, smartphone or computer you want to use. The AirPods appear within MacOS’s menu bar, for instance, or the devices menu in Command Centre. Select them, wait for the small bong and you’re ready to go. Connected to an Apple device, the connection is absolutely bulletproof, reaching at least 10m and resisting interference as if it’s not there. The AirPods also don’t suffer from the small lag most Bluetooth headphones do when connected to Apple devices, which is only noticeable when you’re watching video and the lipsync is slightly out. They can also be used one at a time for mono audio or for taking calls. On iOS, most other Bluetooth headphones require a trip into the settings app to pair, and God forbid you have to try and connect them to a Mac -- the Bluetooth audio handling has been terrible for years and simply not worth even attempting (it’s pretty bad on Windows too). Connecting to Non-Apple Devices Things are different if you want to connect the AirPods to a non-Apple device. A button on the case puts the earbuds into pairing mode when held for a second or so, so you can find them and pair them manually. Many other good Bluetooth headphones have one-touch Bluetooth pairing -- just tap your Android device on a particular spot and you’re done. But that particularly Bluetooth convenience has yet to make it to completely wireless earbuds. The AirPods’ connection to an Android device such as a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge or Google Pixel XL is also not as stable as it is to an iPhone, occasionally suffering from skips rather than the cutouts that plague earbuds such as the Earins. They also do not pause the music when you take them out of your ears, and you cannot activate Google Assistant or Cortana using them -- a double tap simply pauses or plays music. The Case Wireless earbuds are easier to lose so almost all come with some kind of case that charges them, either when plugged in or with an internal battery. Apple’s is arguably the best designed of the lot. It’s small, the earbuds slot in, held in place by magnets, and it provides up to 24 hours of running time, or about five full charges of the AirPods. It charges via Lightning, and snaps shut with a satisfying click. The only thing missing is a battery indicator on the outside of the case, although there is a little LED just under the lid that flashes red when its out of juice. Apple reckons you get five hours of listening between trips in the case and up to 24 hours of battery life between the buds and the case, which is about right in my testing. I used them for a week between charges, listening to about five hours of music a day. For comparison, most others only get under 10 hours of battery life between charges, so what Apple’s managed here is quite remarkable. Observations * Siri adjusts the volume one click at a time, which gets old really quickly * Like most Bluetooth headphones and earbuds, the AirPods emit a little chime when they connect to your device * The stalks hit earrings and the tops of coats or macs done up around the neck causing a loud tap or brushing noise in your ear * Their while colour and stick-out stalks attract attention in your ear, much more so than other good wireless earbuds * There is a Find My AirPods feature that lets you see on a map where you last had your AirPods if you happen to lose them Verdict In some ways I love the AirPods. Apple’s W1 chip really does what it claims: solves Bluetooth connectivity issues that have plagued all but a few truly wireless earbuds, and with excellent battery life too. The case is also brilliant and I don’t even mind the stalk-like design. But it is Apple’s EarPod-like bud design that I cannot get on with. They sound OK, but the lack of any sort of isolation makes listening to music or podcasts very difficult, even at hearing-damaging volumes. The problem is accentuated by the lack of instant volume controls. When you hit the busy street you need to crank them up to not miss anything, but when you emerge into the relative serenity of the office they suddenly sound deafening. I would pay twice the asking price for a set of canal-bud AirPods with proper sound isolation and a few more controls. For those who cannot get on with canal buds or really love EarPods, the AirPods are the best wireless earbuds going, but their advantages are quickly lost when not connected to Apple devices. For everyone else, there are already viable and similarly priced isolating alternatives available, and many more are expected this year. The new Bluetooth 5.0 specification released at the end of 2016 should also provide many of the advantages of Apple’s W1 chip, but for non-Apple devices, although it is unknown how long a wait there will be for both smartphones and earbuds using Bluetooth 5.0. © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Cable, Phone Company Lines Blur Next Article > Your Cable Company Wants To Be Your Phone Company, Too By Tali Arbel PUBLISHED: JANUARY 27 2017 Your TV provider may soon become your phone company. Which seems only fair, because your phone company also wants to be your TV provider. In the next few months, cable giant Comcast will start selling wireless service, just as AT&T and Verizon already do. Charter, the No. 2 cable company, also has a mobile plan. Meanwhile, the largest wireless carriers -- AT&T and Verizon -- have launched digital TV services. The wireless companies are also developing a faster, more reliable version of the mobile internet that could compete with cable's broadband. In Europe, it's increasingly common for consumers to get home internet, mobile service and TV from the same provider, and the U.S. may be heading the same way, helped along by big mergers. Wall Street analysts are already analyzing potential deals, assuming that the Trump administration will be more open to big acquisitions even in industries with just a few dominant companies. This process would spool out over several years, if it happens at all. Cable companies probably won't have much impact on the wireless business until after 2020, MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett wrote in a note back in September. The new wireless standard, called "5G," may also emerge widely around then. If new services work well, it could mean more competition and lower bills for consumers. But mergers could drive prices higher. Broadband providers could also try to steer consumers to their own apps and services, disadvantaging rivals and ultimately limiting consumer choice. The Phone Company Already Does Video AT&T's moves are pressuring Big Cable to act, says JPMorgan analyst Philip Cusick. AT&T offers DirecTV and cellphone broadband nationwide and wants to buy Time Warner, the owner of CNN, HBO, TBS and Warner Bros. Its new mobile-focused online-cable equivalent, DirecTV Now , could steal cable customers if the bugs get worked out . And AT&T promotes DirecTV Now by exempting it from its wireless data caps. That makes it cheaper for a consumer than a rival service. Other phone companies also see video as a way to make more money. T-Mobile hopes to attract more customers with unlimited data plans , which allow endless amounts of (degraded to DVD-level quality) video watching. That could also work as a cable substitute for customers who don't mind TV on a small screen. And Verizon promotes its own, relatively unknown video app, go90, by exempting it from its mobile data caps. Cable in Wireles Regular cable service, of course, is far from dead. Comcast reported growth in cable subscribers in 2016, the first annual gain in a decade, mostly because fewer customers are leaving. Its service bundles can be cheaper than paying Comcast for internet and getting TV elsewhere, its updated X1 cable box helps keep them on board and less expensive "skinny bundles" with fewer channels appeal to customers turned off by cable's expense. The rush of election-related ads and football ads on NBC, which Comcast owns, also boosted results. Fourth-quarter net income rose 16.5 percent to $2.3 billion, and revenue grew 9.2 percent to $21.03 billion. But Comcast is also pushing into wireless because phone video is increasingly popular and people spend a lot of time on mobile devices. As far as consumers are concerned, much of cable's internet service is already, in effect, "wireless," because of home Wi-Fi and millions of hotspots sprinkled throughout cities. Those hotspots don't reliably provide internet access to phones, however, so Comcast and Charter will resell Verizon cell service. Pricing and terms aren't known yet. Down the road, however, analysts figure that cable companies could expand wireless coverage with more carrier deals, building their own wireless networks or just acquiring mobile carriers outright. (Mobile carriers might also buy out cable companies.) Asked if reselling Verizon's network was the extent of the company's wireless ambitions or a stepping stone to something larger, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts said during the company's earnings call Thursday that he hopes the Verizon deal is a sustainable "end-state strategy." But John Malone, a cable pioneer and a major investor in Charter, has suggested that the three biggest cable companies -- Comcast, Charter and Cox -- could together buy T-Mobile, the country's fastest-growing carrier. There have been reports that Verizon is interested in buying Charter. John Legere, T-Mobile's outspoken CEO, predicted that cable's wireless effort won't work. Instead, he foresees a "mobile moonshot" from a tech giant. Google already sells a wireless service, Project Fi. It relies on the Sprint, T-Mobile and U.S. Cellular networks. The "5G" Wireless carriers, meanwhile, are working on 5G -- an upcoming technology that promises much faster internet for cellphones and other uses. (And, maybe, higher prices.) Before it gets to phones, however, 5G might provide an alternative for fast home internet. AT&T and Verizon are both testing "fixed wireless" services for the home. Verizon has launched field tests in 10 areas around the country. AT&T says it will experiment with this home-internet option in Austin, Texas, for customers using its DirecTV Now internet-cable service. It also plans more 5G tests in the second half of the year. It's not clear how widespread 5G fixed wireless will be. There are also questions about whether it'll be as reliable as cable broadband for the ever-growing number of devices in a household, said Strategy Analytics analyst Jason Blackwell. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

It’s not fake. In fact, it’s almost here. These Apple patents reveal that the iPhone 8 could really look like that and it’s so (dagnabit) exciting! 2017 is an exciting year for technology, even more so for Apple. In fact, Wired reminds us that January 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the Apple iPhone. On January 9, 2007, the very first Apple iPhone was released. 10 years after that momentous moment, the iPhone managed to evolve and develop so far ahead its ancestors that this year’s iPhone 8 might just be smartphone of the future. Okay, let’s back up before we get any cheesier than that. Okay yes, 2017 is the iPhone’s 10th year anniversary. Having said that much, we know that iPhone 8 is going to be a legendary piece of work. Not to mention the pressing competition it’s receiving from tight competition Samsung whose Samsung S line is giving Apple’s iPhone line a good run for its money. So what should we expect from the iPhone 8? We’ve been seeing so many reports on what rumors and leaks surround the iPhone 8 before its release this year. But for the iPhone 8 to really make an entrance this 2017, it needs to make a good first impression. And to do so, it needs to be a beautiful, edgy, and fresh-looking smartphone that will wow Apple and non-Apple patrons alike. Part of the rumors that we have been hearing about the upcoming iPhone 8 is the wraparound glass screen design, iTechPost reports. In fact, already a number of concept videos have emerged on YouTube, showcasing their own renders of the supposed wraparound glass display of the iPhone 8. One of the more beautiful and jaw-dropping iPhone 8 renders we have seen on YouTube is this one by Mesut G., and it features the said wraparound glass design. If you think that’s a bit too “into the future,” let us convince you how completely plausible that design will land into the iPhone 8. September last year, Patently Apple came out with a report that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) published an Apple patent entitled “Electronic Device with Wraparound display.” If you check the patent claim by Apple on the USPTO Patent Full Text and Image Database, it reads: In the last few years the functionality of portable electronic devices has increased exponentially. Further improvements be realized by investigating ways to maximize the utility of unused portions of these devices. Form factor is an interesting area for development given that a large majority of portable electronic devices have settled into a standard form factor; namely a flat planar form factor with a display on one side and an opaque housing which contains the electrical components covering the rear surface of the device. Unfortunately, this popular form factor, leaves the sides and rear surfaces of the device unused or at best configured with buttons and switches with fixed location and functionality. Since many of these buttons and switches have fixed functionality they cannot always be incorporated into third party applications. Therefore, there exists a need for an improved form factor for portable electronic devices which allows functionality to extend to more than one surface of the device. According to the claim, this new patent is a continuation of several other “Electronic Device with Wraparound display” patent applications that dates back to 2011. All the applications have now been incorporated into this most recent patent application, which showcases an interesting number of images. Apple Patent figure 2 reads: “shows a perspective view of portable electronic device as internal components of portable electronic device 200 are being inserted into transparent housing.” [Image by USPTO] Figure 4 reads: “shows a perspective view of portable electronic device in operation. Notice how the wrap around display substantially increases the available display area that can be used for display of icons, data, images, video and such.” [Image by USPTO] This patent has been filed April 7, 2015, by Apple, Inc. Cupertino and according to the detailed description, the said device will make use of AMOLED, a flexible display that has been gaining quite a buzz in the tech circles. It also explicitly states that “utilizing a flexible display can provide additional viewing area without increasing either the size or shape of the electronic device,” which means that they don’t necessarily need to build the iPhone 8 bigger to make it look and feel bigger. This particular patent has been the inspiration for the wraparound glass renders for the iPhone 8 and it looks amazing. The rendered iPhone 8 design featuring the said wraparound glass display eliminates the bezel and the home button, making the home button and Touch ID incorporated virtually into the screen itself. Since the patent has been filed in 2015, and we didn’t see this design break ground last 2016, there’s a huge possibility the 2017 iPhone 8 could be it. But then again, we know Apple won’t release a sub-par device so if the design and mechanics of a wraparound glass display still needs refining, there could be a chance we could see this display in 2018, 2019, or even 2020. While unconfirmed, Inquisitr previously reported that many expect a September 2017 release date for the Apple iPhone 8.

Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Who will lead Jayalalithaa's party? Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here NEW DELHI: India may find it difficult to accept Apple’s demand for a 15-year exemption on countervailing duty (CVD) on imported components as the country plans to roll out the goods and services tax (GST) in the coming financial year. "There is no way we can give individual exemptions under GST regime," revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia told ET. "All of them (CVD exemptions) will go." Whatever the tax on local industry, the same will become IGST or integrated GST that will be levied on inter-state trade, he pointed out. "Make in India will get a big boost," he said. "We have been unfair to local industry. I don’t know what exactly is Apple’s demand as DIPP (Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion) is dealing with them. But we have limitations on giving exemptions under GST." Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who’s been seeking to persuade Apple chief executive officer Tim Cook to set up plants in India, tweeted a media report on Saturday that it would start making iPhones in Bengaluru soon. Meanwhile, people familiar with the matter have said the company is still in talks with the government over concessions regarding local manufacturing. When asked about the final call on IGST exemption, Adhia said the decision would lie with the GST Council. GST will subsume central taxes such as central excise duty, services tax, countervailing duty and state taxes including value-added tax, octroi and purchase tax. It is expected to be implemented from July 1. Countervailing duty is levied as part of import duty in lieu of central excise duty. The Cupertino-based company had sought the government’s assurance on CVD exemption for electronic components for 15 years as it looks to set up factories in India. The company has also sought relaxations under the modified special incentive package scheme (M-SIPS). The government scrapped the exemption for populated circuit boards (PCBs) in the February 1 Budget. It had removed CVD exemption for three components, including PCBs, in the last Budget, but restored it following industry demand. The exemption has been abolished to boost the Make in India programme. Apple wants the exemption as its components makers may not relocate immediately to India, increasing its dependence on imported parts. Senior Apple executives met government representatives of various departments at a meeting called by DIPP last Monday. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

However, they can be very expensive if you buy each one individually. To provide some relief to students and educators, Apple has decided to offer some of its best apps in a $199 bundle. The apps will enable users to perform a wide variety of creative functions on their Macs. Apple’s new $199 bundle includes Logic Pro X, Motion 5, Final Cut Pro X, Compressor 4, and Main Stage 3. This bundle provides savings of $430 when compared to purchasing every single one of these apps individually. For example, Logic costs $199 on its own, but if you get this bundle instead you’re getting five of Apple’s best professional creative apps essentially for the price of one. You can’t beat that now, can you? Apple does point out that this bundle is only going to be available to college students, teachers, faculty, and staff. The company’s students discount policy mandates verification by UNiDAYS which is a well-known savings program for college students. Once the bundle is purchased, eligible customers will receive a redemption code by email with which they will be able to unlock the apps via the App Store for Mac. Filed in Apple >Computers.

ISACA's half-year, half-price offer Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com AirPods Review: Best Wireless Earbuds for Apple Devices? By Samuel Gibbs PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 05 2017 When Apple removed the traditional headphone socket from its latest iPhone, part of the rationale was that wireless headphones were now coming into the mainstream. And Apple had its own player in this field, its AirPods. But then there was an unexpected delay in their launch, raising fears over technical issues. Now they’re finally here, are they worth the price tag? The AirPods are not the first wireless earbuds on the market, but until the start of 2016 they all had a cable joining the right and left earbud. Now there’s a new breed of entirely wireless earbuds, but most of them don’t really work. In my testing, only Bragi’s the Headphone and Jabra’s Elite Sport wireless earbuds can keep a connection between themselves. Apple reckons it’s got that particular problem licked with a new processing chip called the W1, which regulates the connection between the earbuds and to the smartphone, tablet or computer. EarPods or AirPods? If you’ve ever seen a set of Apple’s iPhone earphones, the EarPods, you know what the AirPods look and feel like. If you took the EarPods, cut the cables off, made the stalks a little thicker and ever so slightly changed that odd bud shape, you’d have the AirPods. It’s a conscious design decision that you’re either going to like or hate. They perch in your ear, unlike isolating so-called canal buds that wedge themselves in your ear canal, with the stalks going down past your earlobes. The fit is closer to an open, traditional earphone from the early 2000s than the modern canal-fitting earphone. As such, they don’t isolate you from the world around you at all. You can hear everything, even if you push them hard into your ear. As a consequence you have to have the music really quite loud to be able to hear it if you’re trying to block out the rest of your train, plane or bus commute. At work in an office, they offer almost no refuge from the chatter of those around you. But, compared to the EarPods, they leak a lot less sound. So while you can hear everything, you won’t be subjecting those around you to an impromptu tinny disco. They still bleed a little at high volume, but Apple’s done the rest of the world a favour by stopping one of the most annoying things of a modern commute -- other people’s crappy music. Fit Is Up to the Shape of Your Outer Ear The fit is relatively comfortable, but I found they hurt my ears a little after about an hour wearing them. The AirPods are very light and do not drop out of my ears, no matter how hard I shake my head, but neither would a set of EarPods without the cable dragging them down. Running while wearing them in the cold wasn’t a problem, but as I became sweaty they started to slip back from my ear canal and became much quieter. They didn’t come out but how secure they are in your ear relies heavily on the shape of your outer ear. For some people I asked to try out the AirPods, they dropped out of their ears almost immediately after they started getting up from a seat or turning their head. If the EarPods fit and stay in your ear, the AirPods will likely fit as well or slightly better without the drag of the cable. If they don’t you won’t have any luck with the AirPods. It’s also worth noting that the stalks of the AirPods bash into medium-sized shape earrings, meaning that you might have change your style to accommodate them. Audio Upgrade over the EarPods The AirPods sound surprisingly good given the lack of a proper seal in the ear, with relatively full bass and much less of the punishing treble that’s the hallmark of the EarPods. Like most other wireless earbuds, they’re nowhere near as big a step up in quality as a set of wired earbuds costing similar. The AirPods definitely sound better than the EarPods, with more bass than Bragi’s the Headphone, but less separation and distinction between instruments and sounds. Call quality was also pretty good. Although I had to crank up the volume to hear the other end, they could hear me loud and clear even when walking along a congested London street. Lack of Controls Apple’s gone for simplicity with the AirPods, which means no buttons. In fact, there’s only one thing you can do with them once they’re in your lugholes: double tap them to either fire up Siri or pause or play music, depending on what you’ve got as default in settings (when connected to a non-Apple device the only option is pause/play). Connected to an Apple device, when you take one or both out of your ears the music pauses and resumes when you put it back in. Volume adjustment, track skipping or anything else has to either be done via Siri, which is incredibly tedious and requires a good internet connection to work, or by pulling out your smartphone. It feels a bit like Apple built the AirPods for people who own Apple Watches, because volume and play controls can be done via the wrist. Most other wireless earbuds have buttons or gestures for play controls and volume at the very least, and not having even tap gestures to skip tracks and change the volume seems like a backward step. Connection The AirPods make and maintain a strong connection to other Apple products. To pair them all you need to do is open the case that they come in close to an iPhone for the first time and confirm that you want to connect them. That pairing is then shared via iCloud to your other Apple devices, should you use iCloud and have an iPad or a Mac. Switching between devices is as simple as prompting a connection from the tablet, smartphone or computer you want to use. The AirPods appear within MacOS’s menu bar, for instance, or the devices menu in Command Centre. Select them, wait for the small bong and you’re ready to go. Connected to an Apple device, the connection is absolutely bulletproof, reaching at least 10m and resisting interference as if it’s not there. The AirPods also don’t suffer from the small lag most Bluetooth headphones do when connected to Apple devices, which is only noticeable when you’re watching video and the lipsync is slightly out. They can also be used one at a time for mono audio or for taking calls. On iOS, most other Bluetooth headphones require a trip into the settings app to pair, and God forbid you have to try and connect them to a Mac -- the Bluetooth audio handling has been terrible for years and simply not worth even attempting (it’s pretty bad on Windows too). Connecting to Non-Apple Devices Things are different if you want to connect the AirPods to a non-Apple device. A button on the case puts the earbuds into pairing mode when held for a second or so, so you can find them and pair them manually. Many other good Bluetooth headphones have one-touch Bluetooth pairing -- just tap your Android device on a particular spot and you’re done. But that particularly Bluetooth convenience has yet to make it to completely wireless earbuds. The AirPods’ connection to an Android device such as a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge or Google Pixel XL is also not as stable as it is to an iPhone, occasionally suffering from skips rather than the cutouts that plague earbuds such as the Earins. They also do not pause the music when you take them out of your ears, and you cannot activate Google Assistant or Cortana using them -- a double tap simply pauses or plays music. The Case Wireless earbuds are easier to lose so almost all come with some kind of case that charges them, either when plugged in or with an internal battery. Apple’s is arguably the best designed of the lot. It’s small, the earbuds slot in, held in place by magnets, and it provides up to 24 hours of running time, or about five full charges of the AirPods. It charges via Lightning, and snaps shut with a satisfying click. The only thing missing is a battery indicator on the outside of the case, although there is a little LED just under the lid that flashes red when its out of juice. Apple reckons you get five hours of listening between trips in the case and up to 24 hours of battery life between the buds and the case, which is about right in my testing. I used them for a week between charges, listening to about five hours of music a day. For comparison, most others only get under 10 hours of battery life between charges, so what Apple’s managed here is quite remarkable. Observations * Siri adjusts the volume one click at a time, which gets old really quickly * Like most Bluetooth headphones and earbuds, the AirPods emit a little chime when they connect to your device * The stalks hit earrings and the tops of coats or macs done up around the neck causing a loud tap or brushing noise in your ear * Their while colour and stick-out stalks attract attention in your ear, much more so than other good wireless earbuds * There is a Find My AirPods feature that lets you see on a map where you last had your AirPods if you happen to lose them Verdict In some ways I love the AirPods. Apple’s W1 chip really does what it claims: solves Bluetooth connectivity issues that have plagued all but a few truly wireless earbuds, and with excellent battery life too. The case is also brilliant and I don’t even mind the stalk-like design. But it is Apple’s EarPod-like bud design that I cannot get on with. They sound OK, but the lack of any sort of isolation makes listening to music or podcasts very difficult, even at hearing-damaging volumes. The problem is accentuated by the lack of instant volume controls. When you hit the busy street you need to crank them up to not miss anything, but when you emerge into the relative serenity of the office they suddenly sound deafening. I would pay twice the asking price for a set of canal-bud AirPods with proper sound isolation and a few more controls. For those who cannot get on with canal buds or really love EarPods, the AirPods are the best wireless earbuds going, but their advantages are quickly lost when not connected to Apple devices. For everyone else, there are already viable and similarly priced isolating alternatives available, and many more are expected this year.

Google AI Unscrambles Blurred Faces Next Article > Cyberconscripts: Baltic Draftees Can Choose IT Over Infantry By Raphael Satter PUBLISHED: JANUARY 26 2017 The tiny Baltic nation of Estonia is experimenting with the idea of cyberconscription, a move that gives draftees with tech skills the chance to work shoring up their military's electronic infrastructure, an Estonian defense official said Tuesday. The experiment involves between 10 and 20 draftees, Undersecretary of Defense Erki Kodar told The Associated Press at a cybersecurity conference in Lille, in northern France. The pilot program began last summer and will be evaluated after the conscription cycle ends in June. Estonia's compulsory military service means teens can serve between eight to 11 months in the military depending on their role on whether they serve as sailors, soldiers or in other roles. Those accepted as cyberconscripts can expect to pass their time on a help desk or doing programming work, Kodar said. Government agencies and militaries across the world have long struggled to attract and keep cybersecurity professionals in the face of fierce private-sector competition, and Kodar said the plan could be a way of drawing them into the country's military or its reserves. In any case he said it didn't make sense to waste information technology talent. "Maybe a highly skilled IT specialist, it's not good to get them as drivers," he said. Estonia's cyberconscript plan is unusual, but many militaries -- including France, whose cyberdefense reserves had a booth at the conference -- have some kind of a call-up force of information security professionals. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Apple is boosting the prices of iPhones sold abroad by as much as 40% to offset the declining value of foreign sales when they’re converted to dollars. Text Size: A A A Bloomberg/San Francisco The Trump dollar is taking a bite out of the earnings prospects for US companies. Apple is boosting the prices of iPhones sold abroad by as much as 40% to offset the declining value of foreign sales when they’re converted to dollars. Those higher prices hurt Apple’s ability to compete. Industrial giant Honeywell International is trimming its sales forecast this year by $600mn and hedging in the currency markets. Since Donald Trump’s surprise win on November 8, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has gained 2.8% on expectations for rising interest rates, even as he told the Wall Street Journal the strong US currency was “killing us” and criticised China for keeping the yuan artificially low. Before the election, the greenback was already trading near the highest in more than a decade. “Foreign exchange is a bit of a problem for Apple and any US company that has any business overseas,” Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said in an interview. “The dollar is very strong.” Earnings for Standard & Poor’s 500 companies are forecast to rise 11.9% this year after falling an estimated 0.4% in 2016, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would be the fastest annual earnings growth since 2011. For the 259 companies that have reported fourth-quarter results so far, profit has expanded 5.8% from a year earlier and revenue has risen 4.2%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A stronger dollar may hinder future profit gains, however. Every 10% increase in the US currency trims about 3 to 5 percentage points off earnings growth for the S&P 500, said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. “For those pencilling in 10% to 12% earnings growth, that shaves it quite a bit,” he said. “That could have some pressure on equity prices.” While the dollar has weakened about 3% since reaching a 14-year high last month, it remains above the average level for 2016. And companies are still feeling the effects of a yearlong, 19% surge in the dollar beginning in the summer of 2014. Coupled with a plummet in oil prices, the surging dollar led to declines in S&P 500 earnings that lasted five quarters. If Wall Street is right, companies face more dollar appreciation under Trump. Against the euro, for example, the consensus is for the dollar to strengthen to $1.05 at year-end from about $1.08 now. Bill Gross, the billionaire bond investor, says the president’s policies are fuelling a powerful dollar and an undervalued Mexican peso, both of which are bad for the US and global economy. “I think the dollar is a concern,” Gross, who manages the $1.8bn Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund, said in a Bloomberg TV interview Wednesday. “It is the global currency. To the extent that the dollar strengthens, not only are US companies affected to the negative, the global marketplace and global countries are affected too.” Honeywell, which makes products ranging from jet engines to work boots, has locked in the euro at $1.15 and hedges other currencies to protect its profits. The company had to cut the top range of its 2017 sales forecast to $39.5bn from $40.1bn “solely due” to foreign exchange, said CFO Tom Szlosek. For Eaton Corp, which makes parts for heavy trucks, aircraft and earth-moving equipment, the strong dollar has erased $2.5bn of revenue since 2013 and will likely reduce sales by $300mn this year, Chief Executive Officer Craig Arnold said. “The US dollar strength has really been a big negative for us in terms of revenue for the company for four years in a row now,” he said. “If you’re an exporter, it makes the goods and services that you sell around the world more expensive.” A wild card for the dollar is Trump’s plan to overhaul corporate taxes. Republicans have floated the idea of a 20% border-adjustment tax on imports as a way to encourage more manufacturing in the US That plan could cause as much as a 25% gain for the dollar, according to a report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. 0 COMMENTS There are no comments.

PM Narendra Modi’s official app has confirmed that “Apple iPhone production in Bengaluru to commence soon”. Although, the notification mentioned on the app states the ‘International Business Times’ as the source of the news. Last week, Karnataka government had issued a statement welcoming Apple's proposal to begin its initial manufacturing operations in Bengaluru, which hinted that it is moving forward with its plan to assemble iPhones in India. “Apple's intentions to manufacture in Bengaluru will foster a cutting-edge technology ecosystem and supply chain development in the state, which is critical for India to compete globally,” the state government had said in the statement. Minister IT & BT, Govt of Karnataka, Priyank Kharge, had earlier told Reuters that he believes Apple will "tentatively begin manufacturing iPhones in the state by the end of April, or beginning of May." However, as of now, there is no formal agreement or memorandum of understanding done or signed by the state or the Union government with Apple. The buzz about Apple setting up the assembly plant in India started in May 2016 during CEO Tim Cook's first-ever India visit. PM Modi is said to have then asked Apple CEO to look at the possibility of making its devices in India.

Apple Filed Patent For Battery Boost For Apple Watch A recently leaked patent application shows a battery placed on the strap of a wearable device. The wearable device could be the Apple watch. The patent indicates that the face of the watch is circular in shape. This is different from the usual rectangular shape of the Apple Watch display, as reported by GSM Arena. The Issue Of Battery Life In Apple Watch Lack of long battery life has always been an issue of concern with regards to Apple Watch. Though the product went over its previous sale record mark in the 2016 holiday season, the fact that the watch requires charging each night was indeed affecting the product sales. The Apple Watch offers an 18-hour battery life, and if the user fails to charge the watch during the night after use through the day, the watch will be dead the next day. Extending the battery life will indeed make the Apple watch more competitive contender in the wearables market, as reported by CNET. The Patent Gives Out Only Vague Details However, it is not yet clear whether inclusion of the battery in the band will make the Apple watch bulkier or keep it exactly same. Also, it is not yet clear on how many batteries the Apple Watch will be having in case the battery will be embedded into the band itself. With regards to the patent image having a round dial, this is not for the first time Apple is getting the patent for a round dial watch design. Also, it is notable that though the patent got out recently, it was filed in the month of July 2015. The interesting fact about this is that it is the same time the original Apple Watch was launched. It looks like Apple has been having the idea of Battery boost for a long time and are waiting for the right time to release it.  © 2015 - 2017Mobile & Apps, All rights reserved.

With Apple’s next iPhone seeing even more fevered speculation this week, a long-time display expert offers his predictions.   Call it the “iPhone 8,” or “10th anniversary iPhone” or what some analysts on Wall Street refer to as the “iPhone X” -- with "X" referring to the roman numeral 10 -- expectations for Apple’s next phone are high after the company turned in a record quarter this week, selling more iPhones than ever. The centerpiece of that future phone, due later this year, will likely be an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display, according Raymond Soneira, a display expert who heads DisplayMate Technologies and published a report this week with his thoughts on Apple’s future phone. Soneira, who holds a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Princeton University, founded DisplayMate Technologies in 1989, and has advised many of the world's leading device manufacturers “Most of the iPhone 8 OLED hardware display [specifications] will undoubtedly be very similar to the OLED displays on Galaxy Note7, and particularly the upcoming Galaxy S8,” Soneira said in his report. The S8 refers to Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy smartphone. An iPhone using an OLED display -- which offers some critical advantages over liquid crystal displays (LCDs) -- would be a first for Apple, which has used LCDs exclusively to date on its iPhones.  “At least in 2017, everyone’s essentially using the same hardware,” Soneira told Fox News in a phone interview, referring to the fact that Samsung is the only viable high-volume supplier of high-quality OLED smartphone displays and Apple will likely have no choice but to use Samsung OLED displays for the foreseeable future. And that is not just Soneira’s opinion -- Asia-based market research analysts have been saying the same thing for months. The challenge for Apple is that the switch to an OLED display is fraught with complexity. By using an OLED display, not only does the mechanical engineering change but so does the electronics and the batteries -- and the software tied to the display has to be rewritten.  That also presents Apple with an opportunity to set itself apart from the competition. “It will be particularly interesting to see how all the Smartphone manufacturers will differentiate their similar OLED display hardware with differing and innovative software and firmware,” Soneira said in his report. Firmware refers to software that handles certain basic “low-level” control of the hardware. This year expect only one high-end OLED iPhone The conventional wisdom among some analysts and experts is that Apple will only sell one pricey, high-end OLED iPhone model this year. That’s because Samsung won’t be able to supply the tens of millions displays per quarter that Apple needs for multiple models. The South Korean electronics giant must sell its OLED displays to other large smartphone customers while also meeting the in-house demand for its popular Galaxy phones. Soneira did offer some thoughts in his report about what the future OLED iPhone might look like. “With a curved screen OLED, the iPhone display will almost certainly be bezel and border free to the outside edges, and fill all or almost all of the entire front view edge-to-edge,” he said, referring to a display design that has virtually no borders (bezel), which would be a stark contrast to the current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Soneira continued. “With rumors predicting that the home button, fingerprint sensor, ambient light and proximity sensors will be incorporated within the display.” The question that nobody can answer yet, is what will Apple’s secret sauce be. “What’s going to make an OLED phone shine is all of the fancy software, firmware, and OS (operating system) stuff that make the phone useful and nice to use,” Soneira told Fox News.

Traf opened the scoring early on through Salt's cool finish at the back post after a fine team move, but despite their dominance the home side failed to add to their lead and needed a fine save from gloveman Myers to maintain their lead after Traf conceded a spot-kick. Apple Tree finally levelled five minutes before half-time with a cracking goal after a swift counter-attack. The hosts continued to dominate proceedings after the interval but they could not break through the stubborn Apple Tree rearguard and the game went to penalties. After Salt missing the first Traf penalty, Apple Tree went 1-0 up but Luke Jones levelled and Myers' first save made it 1-1 after two spot-kicks each. Jimmy Beadle, who had impressed after coming on as a 50th-minute sub, then put Traf in front and Myers saved again to give the hosts the upper hand, Mark Barber going to score a third for Traf and although the away side replied, Chris Dove slotted home to secure the 4-2 shoot-out win for Traf. Proud Traf boss Col Jenkinson said: "Callum had a great game in goal but the whole back four were playing despite picking up knocks yesterday and they put in a great shift to keep Apple Tree out. This was a great team display by the lads." Angel, who are just a point away from sealing the second division title, romped to a 7-0 home win against Division One strugglers Heslerton in the Scarborough FA Sunday Cup. Lloyd Henderson opened the scoring early on for the home side and a quickfire hat-trick from Ali Caw essentially booked their side in the final eight at home to Trafalgar. David Bell then scored a goal either side of the interval to make it 6-0, and the impressive Jackson Jowett completed the scoring with a great strike from the edge of the penalty area. Angel joint-boss Dan Jones said: "This was an excellent all-round performance from the lads they all did superbly, but in particular, Caw, centre-back Callum Gravestock and Jowett stood out for us." Tom Richardson won the man of the match award for Heslerton. Ayton earned a 6-3 home success against Roscoes Bar. Jake Adams, who had already missed a one-on-one chance early on, opened the scoring with a rare goal for Ayton, then his shot struck Danny Appleby, who claimed the goal as Mark Plumpton's side went 2-0 up. Bar pulled a goal back when Dan Thomas beat his marker and slotted under the keeper, although a Brad Parkin header from a corner restored the villagers' two-goal lead. Jamie Wray then made it 3-2, tapping into an open goal after the home keeper missed the ball and he then turned provider for Thomas to level, the latter lifting his shot over the gloveman. A thumping shot high into the roof of the net from Niall Prentice made it 4-3 at the break to Ayton. Debutant Jonny Blakeston scored the final two goals for Ayton, the Brid Town player scoring his first from the penalty spot and finishing neatly for his second. Player-boss Plumpton had a clear chance to add a late seventh, but he volleyed wide from three yards with an open goal to aim at. Keeper Rich Curtis was the man of the match for Roscoes, his superb saves keeping the game within reach for the visitors, while Blakeston was man of the match in his first start for Ayton. Fylingdales claimed the bragging rights in the clash of the Whitby area sides, easing to a 5-0 home win against FILO. Former Boro striker Jake Day smashed in four goals on his debut for Crown Tavern as the second division strugglers hammered 10-man Fylingdales Reserves 14-0. Travis Wood struck early on for Tavern, with an own goal doubling the home side's lead and Leroy Donaldson hitting a third from the penalty spot. Debutant Day, who has been in fine scoring form for Bridlington Town over the past few weeks in the NCEL Premier Division, then opened his account for his new side and James Burrows added a fifth before the interval against a 'Dales side that were without several regulars. Dave Barber and Burrows notched early in the second half, another own goal made it 8-0, with Day completing his hat-trick either side of a Chrissy Hannam effort for Tavern. Aidan Cooper brought it up to 12-0, Day netting his fourth and Barber his second to finish off the rout. Sean Wood was the man of the match for the victors with Cam Fox the star man for the villagers. Scalby earned a fine 3-1 home win against Newlands Reserves. A deflected free-kick from Tyler Beck opened the scoring for Scalby, who hung on for a while before Brandon Distin doubled the lead following a great through-ball from Dave Tonks. Scalby could have put the game out of reach, but were denied by some brilliant goal keeping by Newlands keeper Jordan Wood. Newlands hit back early in the second half through Nathan Barber to to leave a nervous last half-hour, but Josh Williams wrapped the game up with a cool finish, beating the offside trap and placing the ball past Wood. Twins Adam and Ben Quilter, along with Matty Bourne all had terrific games for Scalby but Max Edwards was named man of the match in a great team performance. Newlands' man of the match award was shared by Wood and central midfielder Dan Sheader.

(Associated Press files) By BARBARA ORTUTAY, Associated Press Published: February 5, 2017, 6:05 AM A   A NEW YORK — The tech industry brought us self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and 3-D printers. But when it comes to racial and gender diversity, its leading companies are no trailblazers. Despite loudly touted efforts to hire more blacks, Latinos and women, especially in technical and leadership positions, diversity numbers at the largest tech companies are barely budging. In 2014, 2 percent of Googlers were black and 3 percent were Hispanic, numbers that have not changed since. The picture is similar at Facebook and Twitter. Microsoft is slightly more racially diverse (though not when it comes to gender) and Apple even more so, though still not reflective of the U.S. population. Amazon is more racially diverse still, although it counts a large, lower-wage warehouse workforce in its totals. Women, meanwhile, make up less than a third of the workforce at many companies — even less in engineering and other technical jobs. Tech companies themselves tend to blame a “pipeline problem,” meaning a shortage of women and minorities with technical qualifications. But a number of academic experts, industry employees and diversity advocates say there’s a bigger problem. Silicon Valley, they argue, has failed to challenge its own unstated assumptions about what makes for great tech employees. “The people who are doing the hiring are not changing their thinking around what they view as qualified,” says Leslie Miley, engineering director at the message-service startup Slack. Hiring managers, he says, spend too much time worrying that applicants who don’t fit techie stereotypes aren’t “Google-y enough or Facebook-y enough or Apple-y enough or Twitter-y enough.” Miley, who is African-American, previously worked as an engineer at Twitter, Apple, Google and Yahoo. • THE INDUSTRY IS TRYING. Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity. Two years ago, Intel splashily set itself the goal of achieving full representation in its workforce by 2020. Despite committing $300 million to the effort and making some early progress, Intel acknowledges there is “a great deal of work to be done.” Similar programs are in place throughout the industry, from outreach at high schools and historically black colleges to internship and mentoring programs and sponsorships for coding boot camps. So far, to little avail. Why? Interviews with more than 30 tech workers, executives and diversity advocates suggest the blame lies with subtle biases in hiring, unwelcoming work environments and a paucity of diverse role models in top positions. Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of the startup Tinsel, says companies should focus on their own culture rather than blaming external factors they can’t control, such as limited computer-science education in U.S. schools. It’s not enough to release diversity reports and say, “Oh, not a lot has changed, but it’s the world, not us that’s the problem,” she says. Williams, who is African-American, says she has made sure to hire women as well as underrepresented minorities. Tinsel makes tech jewelry targeted at women. • WHY IT MATTERS. Diversity isn’t just about fairness. It’s about having designers who reflect the diversity of the people they are designing for. For tech companies hoping to reach millions or billions of users, a lack of diversity could mean their products “will not appeal to a large population,” says Lillian Cassel, chairwoman of computer sciences at Villanova University. Diverse perspectives can also help prevent grievous errors — such as a problem that arose at Google in 2015, when a photo-recognition feature misidentified black faces as gorillas. Some related missteps: • Snapchat released two photo filters that contorted facial features into bucktoothed Asian caricatures or blackface. One was later withdrawn after public outcry. The other “expired,” and the company said it won’t put it back into circulation. • Airbnb initially took no steps to prevent hosts from discriminating against guests whose profile photos showed they were black. The practice was corrected after an outcry. • Twitter took nearly a decade to tackle the harassment of women and minorities on its service. In a New York Times opinion piece, Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford urged companies working on artificial intelligence to address diversity, warning that otherwise “we will see ingrained forms of bias built into the artificial intelligence of the future.” • INTO THE PIPELINE. Some 11 percent of computer science graduates were black and 9 percent were Hispanic in the 2013-14 school year, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Education. Yet only 4 percent of Google’s 2015 hires were black, and 3 percent were Hispanic. At Intel, fewer than 5 percent of hires were black and 8 percent were Hispanic. Numbers at other tech companies are comparable. Major tech companies have a long tradition of hiring applicants from top-tier universities — and those universities also have a problem with diversity, even if they’re doing slightly better than the companies. Some minority applicants, meanwhile, earn their computer-science chops through community colleges or coding boot camps instead — places often overlooked by recruiters. The few minorities hired into big tech companies can often feel alienated in overwhelmingly white (and sometimes Asian) environments. Unsurprisingly, they are sometimes reluctant to recommend their employer to friends, classmates and former colleagues, furthering the cycle of underrepresentation, Williams and others say. • WHEN THE CULTURE DOESN’T FIT. Silicon Valley startups like to talk about “culture fit” — in theory, the question of whether a job candidate’s attitude and behavior meshes well with a company. In practice, though, it can mean that since a lot of people are white and male, they “hire what they know,” says Dave McClure, a prominent angel investor in Silicon Valley. Larger companies such as Facebook publicly eschew discussions of “fit,” although the notion can unwittingly seep into hiring practices. For example, a 2013 study found that words used in engineering and programming job listings could serve to discourage women from applying. Words like “competitive,” “dominant” and “leader” can make a job seem less appealing to women in a field that is already male-dominated. Some companies, including Facebook, offer training on “unconscious bias” to combat the problem. But they don’t make such training mandatory for all employees. And once hired, people can get lost in the shuffle given the lack of role models and mentors in higher ranks — and thus find it difficult to advance. • MAKING CHANGE HAPPEN. Nancy Lee, the Google official in charge of diversity efforts, says the gorilla face-recognition incident was a “wake-up call” for the company. “We need to include all voices from a multitude of backgrounds and experiences (when it comes to the) technology we create,” she says. “We firmly believe that good ideas don’t come out of echo chambers.” Lee says things are getting better, slowly, but that it can be “demoralizing” to those working on diversity issues to be pressured to do things quickly. “We want to solve this for the long haul,” she says.

If you book Uber via Google Maps you can get £20 off your journey That’s why we took one of the hottest phones around right now, Google’s new flagship Pixel XL, for a one month test drive to see whether it lived up to the hype. And let’s just say those billboards are not lying. An Apple user’s review of the Google Pixel: Let’s get this straight. I am not an Apple whizz, neither do I claim to know everything about Android’s latest technology. But I am a heavy user of all Apple products, which is why I decided to compare Google’s flagship phone with Apple’s iPhone 7. (That and the fact that it’s just too fascinating not too). I then asked my colleague, a self-confessed technophobe, to share her thoughts on the Pixel. Here are our thoughts: (Picture: Ella Byworth/Apple/Google) Appearance If you want a sleek phone, the Google Pixel is it. The phone comes in two sizes, 5” or 5.5”, and is available in two colours, Quite Black and Very Silver. It’s thin, light and is made to feel good in your hands – just like the iPhone, but has a softer feel. Google’s year in review shows that 2016 hasn’t been all bad (promise) One major difference in appearance is that the imprint touch button is at the back of the phone rather than the front. At first, I couldn’t get my head around it, but after a while you realise it is easier to unlock your phone with one button while it’s resting in your palm. The only downside is that due to the size of the XL, you sometimes find yourself having to readjust the phone so that you can reach the touch keyboard. For that reason, I prefer Apple’s front touch button to Google’s – but on looks alone, the Pixel’s winning by far. Storage For all you Apple users out there, the storage on the Pixel is probably the most impressive feature of the phone. The phone offers unlimited photos and video storage which is great for those iPhone users constantly finding themselves having to upp their monthly payments of iCloud storage just so prized photos don’t disappear. (The struggle is real). And to make it even better, once you’ve taken a photo, Google Photos keeps all your photos backed up, organised, and searchable, so you can find and share them faster than ever. Is it the iVape? Apple patents its first ‘vapouriser’ device Apple, take note. Camera I’d buy the Pixel just for the camera.  It’s true that Apple’s low photographic capabilities are incredible but the Pixel’s camera is far superior. With the best-ever 89 DxoMark Mobile score, Pixel’s camera lets you take stunning photos in low light, bright light or any light, and you don’t even need a filter on it. It also has a Smartburst feature which lets you catch action shots as they happen and can also turn fast shots into gifs on the spot (my favourite feature). The Lens Blur feature allows you to achieve shallow depth of field and bokeh effects, so you can always be the centre of attention.

Sorry everyone, Apple says it won’t replace dodgy batteries in iPhone 6 Siri and I have never been friends due to the fact that she never gets what I’m asking straight away. Google’s Assistant on the other hand is faster and more capable, and can do most of what Siri can do. (She was a lifesaver when I needed to find the nearest Starbucks so I could use the bathroom!) Battery life Google’s phone comes with an impressive 18W charger that lasts well over a day and a half and only takes a short 15 minutes-or-so to charge up. Which is perfect for people like me who are constantly on their phone.

The Pixel, on the other hand, lasted the whole day, with me only having to put it back on charge before I went to bed. Pre-installed apps Coming from an Apple, pre-installed apps aren’t really a problem. But Samsung users and other Android users will know all too well about pre-installed bloatware that comes with the phone. Luckily, the Pixel comes with none of that and has the latest version of Android Nougat, giving the phone a guaranteed two years of software updates and three years of security updates. (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro) A technophobe’s experience of the Google Pixel – by Miranda Larbi. I’ve never really been interested in phones. I got my first mobile (which I didn’t have to share with my sister) at about 14 and ever since then, have always been at least two models behind everyone else. Japan unveils ‘toilet paper’ for smartphones So I’d literally never heard of Google Pixel before it got thrust into my hand at a demo. ‘This is the best camera phone available,’ I was told repeatedly. And to be fair, the camera in the iPhone 4S that I’d had for over two years did take shocking photos. So, I resigned my old phone to the back of my sock drawer and tried out the Pixel. Ease I am rubbish at technology and this phone did take a bit of time to get used to. Because it’s a Google phone, it works with your Gmail and I struggled for ages (and still am a little) in getting my Yahoo! account to show up in my emails. How to wean your tech-addicted child off their mobile phones and iPads What I do like about the Pixel is that your notifications are quite unobtrusive, so if you’re trying to ignore someone on Whatsapp, you can flick the notification screen down, see who is texting and then leave it and the tiny Whatsapp symbol will sit quietly in the top left corner. Easy to ignore. My one bugbear, however, is the difficulty in setting reminders. On Apple, there’s an actual reminder’s app and it was my lifeline. On this phone…I have no idea. I try to use the calendar and most of the time, the reminders never show up. It’s a relatively straightforward phone to use but I don’t think it’s made for idiots like the iPhone is. The Google Pixel lets you customise your own ‘live’ case – like this one (Picture: Metro.co.uk) Camera This is the most crucial thing about this phone. You could buy any number of big Androids if you just wanted a large phone. But the camera on Pixel is truly fantastic. You can blur out backgrounds. You can take selfies simply by shaking the phone to reverse the lens. I’ve been able to take some incredible photos (not to blow my own trumpet) of my baby niece using the Pixel and even my iPhone 7-owning mum has agreed that my pictures have come out better than her’s. Praise indeed, from such a committed Apple user and one who spent I don’t want to know how much on the 7 solely for its camera capabilities. MORE: Facial-recognition technology can now measure how bored students really are The lighting on the Pixel is awesome (Picture: Miranda Larbi) Size and appearance My hands are pretty normal-sized, although I do have rather small, sausage-like fingers. And that was fine on my old phone but the Pixel is massive. It is hard to text with one hand and I have ended up sending some very odd Whatsapp messages to people as a result. But the display is infinitely superior to any phone I’ve ever used. The menu is clearer. The screen is better for watching videos and iPlayer. Fire Emblem Heroes is Nintendo’s next smartphone app Apps The size and camera both affect the quality of apps. I used to use Instagram before but it’s almost impossible not to upload a picture every day now simply because the quality of the picture is so much better and the shutter speed is so quick. And the filming capacity on Pixel also means you can upload all kinds of good-looking videos to Instagram. I, for example, am trying to track my fitness progress and this phone is perfect for taking progress videos of rehabilitation exercises – something I’d never have bothered with on my own rubbish phone. Snapchat is another app which is greatly improved, which now means I waste far too much time snap-chatting pictures of my cats to all and sundry. The Google Pixel was released in October 2016 (Picture: Reuters) Storage One of the problems with my old phone was the complete lack of storage. I had to delete pictures every week and as for downloading Spotify playlists? Forget it. Pixel’s storage is incredible. I’ve taken so many random photos already and there doesn’t seem to be any letting up anytime soon. And they’re all automatically categorised and backed up to my Google account which is incredibly handy. Young girls’ phone numbers are being sold for 50p in India Security Unlike the iPhone, you unlock the Pixel screen with your fingerprint at the back of the phone and you can save two fingerprints (so a finger from both hand). IMO, that’s far better than the whole thumbprint on iPhone which for me always took a few attempts to get to work. However, my mate did manage to get into my phone the other day, I think by simply flicking her finger up the screen and perhaps guessing my password…so it’s not foolproof by any means. Alas, the Pixel has transformed me from being a very sociable, attentive companion into an obsessive texter, Instagrammer, and Snapchatter. It’s best phone I’ve ever used (not hard) and I’m damned if I’m going to give it up any time soon.

Google Play Store vs Apple’s App Store - A Comparison GO Which is friendlier for users, Play Store or App Store? Feb 5, 2017 12:12 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  The two biggest players in the app market are surely Google and Apple with their own dedicated stores for users to find and download applications for almost anything. While Google Play Store features a greater number of apps, the App Store is the place where developers can capitalize their work more. Apple launched its App Store in 2008 when the iPhone 3G was announced. 500 apps were available at first, but within 5 years their number passed the 1 million milestone. Last quarter, Apple’s App Store saw a 60% year-on-year revenue growth, while the Play Store grew by 82%, and the total number of apps reached 2.7 million in January 2017, compared to 2.2 million in the App Store. The Play Store was launched in 2008, formerly known as Android Market, and it quickly outgrew the App Store and reached about 64 billion downloads in 2016, while the App Store recorded just a little over 25 billion downloads during the same year, according to App Annie. App Store and Play Store downloads worldwide Free and paid apps in stores From a developer’s perspective, the best place to monetize an app is surely the App Store, considering that it generated $5.4 billion in revenue in Q4 2016, while the Play Store only managed to generate $3.3 billion in the same quarter. Both the Play Store and the App Store offer the same revenue-sharing terms to developers, 70% of the amount paid by users goes to developers. However, since there are fewer apps in the App Store, developers could generate more revenue here compared to the Play Store. Reports have shown that iOS users don’t mind paying for a reliable app, while the situation in the Play Store is quite different. Because many apps compete in the same category, developers tend to make their apps free in order to attract more users. Top free apps in the App Store This poses an advantage for users, but not really for developers. To monetize on their apps, they would sometimes incorporate ads, which could drive some users to competing cleaner apps. Seeing how the size of the App Store is smaller, the competition isn’t that harsh. Paying a few dollars a month for a good app isn’t bothersome for iOS users, but it could drive some of them to the Play Store’s free alternatives. Instant apps and beta testing Google’s Play Store allows users to push app installation on all of their phones and tablets in an instant. If you want to install the same app on your iPhone and iPad, you’d have to do it manually for both devices. It’s not that big of an inconvenience, but it does make a difference in terms of usability. Moreover, Google is currently testing Instant Apps for Android users. This means that users will no longer need to download an entire app in order to check out its content. Bits and parts of the app are installed on the device instantly, allowing users to access content and save space on the device. Many times, users receive a message or tap on a link that can be opened only in a specific app. With Instant Apps, they no longer need to install an entire application just to see a picture or read an article. Apple’s iPhone users don’t have this functionality. The Play Store also offers users the option to test out beta apps and get the latest features. Beta versions are sometimes unstable, but users can opt out of beta testing at any time. Types of apps Android mobile OS runs on an abundance of smartphones and tablets, with different CPUs, RAM capacity and display sizes. Android developers usually make their apps available to a greater number of devices, compared to iOS. While most apps in the App Store work both on iPhones and iPads, there are still some that are exclusive to smartphones and weren’t properly adapted to the larger screen of an iPad. In terms of app categories, education, lifestyle, entertainment, business and personalization are the most popular in the Play Store. Users can find an abundance of apps that meet their needs, whichever that is. The phrase “There’s an app for that” launched by Apple a few years ago to promote its App Store has started applying to its main competitor, the Play Store. Play Store top apps Apple has a tendency to promote games on its App Store, which is where Apple makes a lot of revenue. One prolific case is that of the highly anticipated Super Mario Run which was launched on iOS first, while the Android version still hasn’t arrived yet. To maximize the impact of their apps, many developers have launched versions for both iOS and the Play Store, but the latter has some more options. Play Store offers apps for customizing your rooted phone by automating certain commands using Tasker or other apps. Reviews and refunds Searching for an app is much easier on the Play Store, considering that Google excels in creating efficient search algorithms. Google also integrated Google+ features, so whenever you’re reading reviews for an app, those written by your friends appear at the top. Receiving a recommendation from a friend weighs more compared to reading reviews from complete strangers. However, Apple has a system that promotes apps with ratings higher than 4 stars giving them a boost and improving their rank to make it easier for users to discover them. In addition, Apple is believed to work on a system that allows developers to ask users to rate an app just three times in a year. Some apps downloaded from the Play Store will ask users for ratings continuously. Users who paid for apps downloaded from the Google Play Store can get a refund within 2 hours of making the purchase. The no-questions-asked refund policy is even more appealing on the App Store, with a 14-day return policy for customers in the European Union and other regions. Security They say the App Store is safer, and that might be true considering that Apple takes a lot of time to review each app individually. In fact, this is one of the main principles behind the store for iOS, applications are reviewed and receive a rating from Apple, a process that can take a little over a week. This way, Apple wants to make sure that apps in its store follow guidelines. App Brain revealed that the number of low-quality apps reached 337,000 on the Play Store last month, but there aren’t any such numbers for iOS. Low-quality apps don’t necessarily contain malware, but they don’t improve user experience. On the flip side, it’s much faster to publish apps on the Play Store, as long as they meet Android guidelines. There have been many cases in which malicious apps made it to the Play Store, Google would remove an app only if it’s reported by a number of people. Even though Apple reviews apps firsthand, that doesn’t mean they’re necessarily safer. A prolific case was the XcodeGhost malware which infected 4,000 apps. In order to create an iOS app, developers must use Apple’s Xcode program which has a size of 3GB. In countries where Internet speed is quite slow, like China, it can take about an hour to download. Therefore, some developers downloaded the program containing the malware from third-party websites and thus infected their apps and the phones of users. Conclusion Depending on which smartphone you own, you will be using apps from the Play Store or the App Store. But if you were to pick a phone simply based on apps that you would like to use, both stores offer their advantages and disadvantages. The Play Store and Android offers a lot more flexibility for users in terms of customization and types of apps, but the Apple Store has more secure apps. However, Apple’s App Store seems to be focusing on games, while the Play Store is filled with photo editing and education apps. Android apps are clearly cheaper and there are completely free alternatives to any app that you might wish to check out. But in terms of security, iOS apps are safer, although there have been apps with malware in the App Store too. We’re leaning towards the Play Store, but let us know what your thoughts are.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (4 Images) #Google#Apple#Play Store#App Store#Instant apps subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Google Play Store vs Apple App Store (4 Images) 01 02 03 04 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Now Launcher to Be Discontinued by the End of March Google Photos 2.8 Gets Redesigned UI and Changes to Device Folders Nintendo Releases Fire Emblem: Heroes for Android and iOS, Servers Struggle Instagram Is Testing Multi-Photo Album Support in New Version Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Feature An Iris Scanner Let’s Chat: Windows vs. Linux Windows Close to Defeating Linux: Munich Could Give Up on LiMux Samsung Galaxy S8’s Bixby To Be Based on S Voice, Not Viv Labs’ AI Tech Microsoft Brings Windows 10 Mobile’s File Explorer on Xbox One Microsoft Teases New Windows 10 Security Announcements Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Feature An Iris Scanner Let’s Chat: Windows vs. Linux 4 photos    Play Store and App Store logos New Android APKs HideMy.name VPN APK: Updated February 8th, 08:39 GMT Microsoft Flow APK: Updated February 6th, 15:23 GMT Ghost Commander File Manager APK: Updated February 6th, 15:12 GMT Google Play Store APK: Updated February 6th, 15:09 GMT Skype Mingo APK: Updated February 6th, 15:01 GMT Waze APK: Updated February 6th, 14:58 GMT Duolingo APK: Updated February 5th, 08:44 GMT Reader comments Samsung Galaxy S8’s Bixby To Be Based on S Voice, Not Viv Labs’ AI Tech more on: Samsung i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

The next edition of the Apple Watch is likely to feature better processing power. Thus, to complement for long hours of seamless operations, it will surely need more battery life. Also, this is certainly not an easy process as the dial case is already packed with sensors. The Cupertino-based giant is finding new ways to implement a larger battery capacity to its iconic Apple Watch. As per the latest patents filed by Apple, the company is working towards implementing a wristband battery charge, where the wristband is supposed to feature magnetic charging point for an easy snap on/ snap off access. Moreover, the patent also reveals that the tech giant is considering for another alternative approach that shows a separate module underneath the chassis of the watch which further attends to the wristband. Power to the watch would be supplied through this module. They have also implemented an overheating protection system that determines whether the user is wearing the watch or not, regulating the power transfer to avoid your wrist from getting too hot. This battery pack could itself be recharged using Apple Watch’s magnetic charging dock or via a Lightning cable. For its Series 1 Apple Watch, battery life has been one of the major complaints by users. Paying serious attention and focus to this, Quanta – the company behind the making of Apple Watch batteries – is making all efforts to overcome this issue. Moreover, Apple also seems to be testing these solutions as it would not prefer to compromise on the thickness of the Watch, as the design is always among its top priority. Also, of the interesting things that we could be seeing with the new Apple Watch design is the change in dial shape. The patent image shows the possibility of a round dial in the upcoming watch and it would be interesting to see that how Apple makes this drift.

It wasn't until this latest Runkeeper update that I was able to do so and replace my GPS sports watch. By Matthew Miller for The Mobile Gadgeteer | February 4, 2017 -- 16:34 GMT (08:34 PST) | Topic: Mobility Image: RunKeeper In my quest to find a smartwatch that can also stay on my wrist to track my running, I've been through dozens of different devices. This includes wearables from Garmin, Polar, Apple, Samsung, TomTom, and more. I may have finally found what I need thanks in large part to an application. Apple Watch CNET Review: A beautiful, bold watch, with complications Apple sets high bar for smartwatches on first attempt Hidden port for Apple Watch can be used to charge it, perhaps more 7 tips and tricks to get the most out of your new Apple Watch Last year I purchased a Garmin Fenix 3 HR and it is an incredible GPS sports watch that tracks every stat I could hope for during runs. I am a recreational runner who is trying to keep my weight down, achieve some personal bests, and improve my health for a quality life as I age. It's rare that I look at the detailed stats from my Garmin and there is no real community of my friends and family in the Garmin ecosystem. I purchased the Apple Watch Series 2 a few months ago and tried the first release of Runkeeper for watchOS 3. It did a great job at tracking runs and syncing up to the service, but there was no GPS status so runs began with a step of faith that the Apple Watch was capturing the data. The lack of GPS status is the same thing we see in the Apple Workout app and in S Health on the Samsung Gear S2 and S3. It's a small detail, but one that caused me to stick with the Garmin Fenix 3 HR. A couple months ago Runkeeper updated its app and added a small GPS signal indicator to the upper right of the launch screen. This minor improvement prompted me to give the Apple Watch Series 2 another chance. Runkeeper for Android Wear, watchOS, and Pebble has always offered just a very basic interface and even though I am a recreational runner it was never enough. The recent update didn't just add the GPS signal indicator, but we now see the ability to customize the three fields for metrics you want to see while running, view a heart rate graph for the past five minutes, and view your pace for the past five minutes with a line showing your target pace so you can adjust on the go. All of these are welcome additions and I look forward to even more. Image: RunKeeper Run data is incorporated with the Apple Activity app and also syncs up to the Runkeeper website. For some odd reason, the website only shows the basic stat summary, your GPS maps, and heart rate tracking. The iOS Runkeeper app shows your splits, pace chart, heart rate chart, and stride rate chart so there is more data being captured than shown on the website. If you then open up Runkeeper on an Android device, you will also see an elevation chart. I went on a six mile run yesterday with the Apple Watch on one wrist and the Garmin Fenix 3 HR on the other. The heart rate tracked about the same and the difference in distance was only 0.05 miles (264 feet). I've seen repeated accuracy like this for the Apple Watch Series 2 so it meets my needs for accurate GPS run tracking. In addition, I am motivated by music and more than any other wearable I have tested the Apple Watch streams music to my Bluetooth headset flawlessly. The Apple Watch is also a fantastic smartwatch, allowing me to communicate with people, track my other activity, see key information quickly, and more. Battery life has been fantastic and even after tracking my day there is still enough juice left to go on a nice run in the evening. I was completely wrong about GPS on the Apple Watch and am extremely pleased with it as a wearable that meets all my needs. The Apple Watch may not be the next iPhone, but it is an excellent GPS sports watch for many of us.

The best HomeKit accessories Let’s Talk Jailbreak 158: The ends and the means The best iOS 10 jailbreak tweaks   skip to main content skip to main menu     Enable Split View and Slide Over features on unsupported devices with this tweak By Anthony Bouchard, Feb 5, 2017 Tweet 25 Comments Slide Over and Split View are two amazing features of iOS, but Apple has limited them to a select few iPads for what they call, “performance restraints.” As we all know, many of Apple’s other devices are capable of utilizing these features too, so a new jailbreak tweak called Gorgone by CydiaGeek unlocks the features on any previously-unsupported devices, so long as they’re jailbroken of course. To start, we should mention that Slide Over and Split View are normally only enabled on the following devices out of the box: iPad Pro iPad Air 2 iPad Air iPad mini 4 iPad mini 3 iPad mini 2 (except Split View) You will notice that not a single iPhone, not even the 5.5-inch models, are supported in the list. Neither are certain models of iPad, like the iPad with Retina display, which is perfectly capable of running the feature. Of course, Apple’s real reason for blocking these features isn’t necessarily due to “performance restraints,” or even “usability issues,” but rather the fact that it’s a marketing ploy to get you to buy their tablets and upgrade to newer ones where necessary. If you simply install Gorgone, you can activate Slide Over and Split View on any of your devices, regardless of whether Apple has it enabled by default or not. As shown above, the feature works perfectly (and smoothly, I might add) on a 5.5-inch iPhone. To use it, you just swipe from the right side of the screen, which displays the app picker. From there, you can choose an app, and iOS will load the app right beside the app you’re already in. The feature would probably even work on a smaller iPhone, like the iPhone SE, but I have a feeling that the severely undersized screen might be a little less comfortable to work with this feature on. For what it’s worth, the tweak also enables Home screen rotation on unsupported devices, which means even those smaller 4-inch iPhones can enjoy a landscape Home screen, just like the larger iPhones have been enjoying for the last two years. Gorgone will add a preferences pane to the Settings app where you can enable or disable the tweak on demand. It also includes a Respring button so that you can save your changes. I think that the Split View works pretty good on a 5.5-inch iPhone, so if you’ve ever needed to look at two apps side by side, I would recommend checking the tweak out. It’s a free download from Cydia’s Bigboss repository and works on all jailbroken iOS 9 and iOS 10 devices. Would you ever use Slide Over on your iPhone? Share how you would use it below!

Only slide over is supported Anthony Bouchard Thanks, made an edit. Noohar Please do a video of it running on a Plus iPhone! :D There should be an option for using two fingers to enter split view instead of just one. I had to uninstall this tweak because I kept on entering split view by accident. Plus there’s the fact you can’t use the forward gesture with this tweak installed. Iskren Donev Two questions: 1. Can the Slide-Over app take up the full screen rather than just 4/5 of it? 2. Does this tweak also enable PiP (Picture in Picture) mode? Jayy I can’t answer your first question, but if you want PiP download a tweak called ForceInPicture Mohammed Khaled Kawsar wrong… not supported on ipad air 2… only slide over… not split view .Monkey No, it is supported Swanny246 I think Mohammed was referring to the stock feature, not the jailbreak tweak. Mohammed Khaled Kawsar Sorry mate. Was referring tO iPad Air 1 Mike My Stock and unjailbroken iPad Air 2 supports slide over and split view. Anthony Bouchard Thanks for reporting back Mike. I edited the article based on your reply, as well as a few others. CydiaGeek Thanks for the Review, man! 🙂 :D Did you build the tweak? It would be really great if you could add an option for having to use 2 fingers. That’s the one thing it’s missing and it’s the reason I ended up uninstalling it. It otherwise did work well. Firedomain I feel like 2 fingers would be unintuitive on an iPhone, maybe something like the grabber arrow that pops up after the 1st swipe might be useful. :D I’m currently using Tage and I have it set to two fingers. The only issue is that you can’t activate it if you’re using your phone in one hand. Even though a grabber would prevent accidental activations, you would still have to give up the forward gesture. Firedomain Ah yea, forgot about that. I don’t often use that gesture. CydiaGeek Yup it is me. I will look for it asap and thanks! :D Awesome, thanks 🙂 CydiaGeek Welcome:) John The article says iPad Air 2 doesn’t support Split View, but mine (model A1566) absolutely does Mike Mine does too. Anthony Bouchard I’m receiving conflicting information here. One reader said it does not support, and now you’re saying it does support. The article originally said it did support, and I edited it to say it didn’t support after the first reader said it did not. EDIT: I fixed the article again. Thank you for pointing it out. Oakenshield Tweak not working on my iPhone SE iOS 9.3.2 Eliijah Moss Correction, tested and works on iPhone 6S Plus. It’s lists under the tweaks description that it works on iPhones too, unless the test was taken off. I’m using a mother tweak though.

Sony Xperia Z5 The Xperia Z5 is Sony's 2015 flagship and the last model of the Z series, replaced by the X series in February 2016. When it launched, it pushed changes in the camera, offering a new 23-megapixel sensor that is now seen in the newer Xperia X models. It's a good performer, but it is hampered by slow software, making the experience a little lacklustre - but in many ways, better than Sony's more recent phones. There is plenty of power in the Z5, the water resistance that Sony is known for and it's a handset packed full of tech, as well as plenty of customisation from Sony. The design isn't quite as premium as you'll find elsewhere however, meaning the Xperia Z5 is overshadowed by more exciting rivals, and Sony's software is the biggest bugbear. Sony Xperia Z5 review: Flagship foibles Buy for £400 from Amazon UK, $483 from Amazon US Pocket-lint 16. BlackBerry Priv BlackBerry's Priv was the company's first Android handset and it is a serious phone worthy of serious consideration, whether you're a BlackBerry fan or an Android fan. The slider handset with its huge 5.4-inch display, offers all the benefits of the latest Android devices, with a physical keyboard that BlackBerry users will find familiar. It's blessed with BlackBerry Hub and a range of BlackBerry shortcuts and features reinvented for Android. It's not the fastest handset around, the camera isn't the best and it lacks a fingerprint scanner, but it is an innovative handset that offers some charming twists. The Priv is also now available for £425, so it's pretty cheap too - and although it's the only Android phone around with a keyboard, it is getting old. BlackBerry Priv review: A sweet BlackBerry and Android pie Buy for £367 from Amazon UK, $349 from Amazon US Pocket-lint 15. Motorola Moto X Play The Moto X Play's attraction comes from the huge battery, meaning it offers some of the best endurance you'll find in an Android handset. Yes, this is the phone to pick if you want it to last not just through the day, but through the night and the following day too. It's a mid-range handset, offering Motorola's Moto Maker customisation, but it isn't the most powerful or exciting handset around. You miss out on a fingerprint scanner and the camera isn't great in low light either but for those of you after a clean Android experience, Moto's customisation and a great battery life, this could be the phone for you, although it is getting a little old. Motorola Moto X Play review: Big-battery beauty Buy for £294 from Amazon UK, $289.99 from Amazon US Pocket-lint 14. LG G5 The LG G5 offers a modular-based design that allows for additional accessory units which can be added for new features and operation. The dual-camera is something special, the Quad HD screen looks the part, and with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB RAM and QuickCharge 3.0 to boot, there's all the power you could need. The metal body looks and feels plastic though and while it's great there is a fingerprint sensor on board, it's a little small and not as foolproof as some competitors despite its clever rear positioning. The LG G5 is there for innovation and point of difference, but it may not be the smartphone for everyone. LG G5 review: Modular misfire? Buy LG G5 for £385 from Amazon UK, $408 from Amazon US Pocket-lint 13. Huawei Mate 9 The Huawei Mate 9 goes big on that Huawei experience, pushing out to 5.9-inches. The quality of build now fits what we expect from Huawei, fused here with a twin camera arrangement, once again with Leica branding. There's power and incredible battery life, which really makes the Mate 9 appeal. At the same time, Huawei's software isn't as clean and refined as it should be and the Mate 9 also suffers from letting the price creep up. Set at €699, it's still much cheaper than many rivals, but availability might be limited, so  Huawei Mate 9 review: The big-screen boss Buy for £597 from Amazon UK, $719 from Amazon US Pocket-lint 12. Motorola Moto G4 Motorola's Moto G4 is the fourth generation of the popular Moto G and it's bigger and bolder than the original. A 5.5-inch display is seen this time round, and it's a little more expensive too, starting at £169, but you still get a lot of bang for your buck. The Moto G4 might not be as fast as the flagships on this list, but its octa-core processor and graphics are capable of handling most tasks and battery life is good. The Moto G4 is the king of the budget handsets and although there is the option of the G4 Plus with its improved camera and fingerprint sensor, the Moto G4 is a phone that shouldn't be ignored. Motorola Moto G4 review: Budget phone king goes large, remains in charge Buy for £149 from Amazon UK, $199.99 from Amazon US Pocket-lint 11. Honor 8 For a mid-level device, the Honor 8 lays down some solid specification benchmarks for its £370 price. As a day-to-day phone, the design and ability of this mid-ranger are considerable. It's an upgrade over the previous model that will give plenty of competitors a run for their money. The battery life could be better, the processor performance lags a little at times and it doesn't offer the perfect graphics for gaming. That said, there is plenty of merit in the Honor 8, and its biggest problem isn't actually itself, but the competition it is up against, such as the OnePlus 3T that is only £30 more. Honor 8 review: A different take on the premium mid-range market Buy for £369 from Amazon UK, $299.99 from Amazon US Pocket-lint 10. Huawei P9 The Huawei P9 is a step above and beyond last year's P8. It has cleaner software, ample power, decent cameras, the best fingerprint scanner on the market, and a variety of features that successfully place it in among the flagship runnings. There's still some questionable software additions though, the cameras are over-reaching in terms of software and the battery life still isn't that great. The P9 delivers solid innings, but its £449 starting price puts it very close to its competition and the P9 lacks those design nuances that set the flagship contenders apart. Huawei P9 review: The flagship and the folly Buy for £400 from Amazon UK, $451 from Amazon US Pocket-lint 9. Apple iPhone 6S The Apple iPhone 6S might have been succeeded by the iPhone 7, but it's still a great iPhone, especially at its slightly reduced starting price of £499. It doesn't offer waterproofing like the latest model, but it delivers a slick, fast experience and its 12-megapixel rear camera continues to produce some excellent results. The iPhone 6S also introduced 3D Touch, Apple's version of a pressure sensitive display that is also found on the newer model. It's not unique, but the depth to which Apple has empowered this new feature stands it aside. It might not be the flagship iPhone anymore, but the iPhone 6S still offers the premium Apple experience. Apple iPhone 6S review Buy for £490 from Amazon UK, $429.99 from Amazon US Pocket-lint 8. Apple iPhone SE Fulfilling the requirements of those looking for a smaller iPhone, the iPhone SE is about as budget as Apple gets. Starting at £359, the iPhone SE punches into the mid-range, but the only thing mid-range about this phone is the display size. The iPhone SE has all the power of the iPhone 6S, giving you speed and power that smaller phones often fail to give you. It's a full-bore iPhone experience that's pared with an excellent camera, offering the consistency you expect from Apple. For those after the Apple experience without the hole in their pocket, the iPhone SE is an excellent choice. It's also one of the best selling iPhones out there. Apple iPhone SE review: Great things can come in small packages Buy for £384 from Amazon UK, $429.95 from Amazon US Pocket-lint 7. HTC 10 The HTC 10 addresses many of the criticisms of the HTC One M9, focusing on the things that matter in a smartphone, and ditching many of the distractions. The HTC 10 is built to the high quality standard you expect from HTC, and it's a handset that solid and serious. The 5.2-inch display packs a Quad HD resolution, power comes from the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset and 4GB of RAM, while there is OIS on both the front and back cameras. The result is power, performance, great design and camera performance, held together with fuss-free software that's slick, fast and free from bloat. HTC 10 review: Welcome back to the premier league Buy for £492 from Amazon UK, $527 from Amazon US Pocket-lint 6. Apple iPhone 7 Plus The Apple iPhone 7 Plus offers more new features to the iPhone party than its smaller sibling, but they come at a price, which is why this device sits a little lower down our list. Like the smaller device, the design sees refinement rather than overhaul, with Apple removing the headphone jack, hiding the antenna bars and adding waterproofing. The novelty comes in the form of a zoomed camera and the option for digital bokeh effects, but they might just be that - novelties. It's a worthy upgrade from the iPhone 6 Plus or iPhone 6S Plus, with excellent and improved camera capabilities, along with power and battery performance. The iPhone 7 Plus is big and heavy, as the range always has been, but it is incredibly well-built, capable and well-rounded. It's just well expensive too with a starting price of £719. Apple iPhone 7 Plus review: Big changes from the big iPhone Buy for £856 from Amazon UK, $929 from Amazon US Pocket-lint 5. Samsung Galaxy S7 The Samsung Galaxy S7 takes what the SGS6 started and refines it. It tweaks the design slightly, adds IP68 water and dust protection and brings the microSD card back. Internally, there's plenty of power for a slick performance from the Exynos or Qualcomm chipset and 4GB of RAM, alongside a wonderfully vibrant Quad HD AMOLED display. A wide range of functionality is offered through Samsung's TouchWiz beautifully optimised reworking of Android, while improved battery performance and a consistent and dependable camera give you the recipe for one of the most compelling smartphones on the market. It's out shined by the SGS7 edge version, but it's a solid performer none the less. Samsung Galaxy S7 review: The unsung hero? Buy for £460 from Amazon UK, $509 from Amazon US Pocket-lint 4. OnePlus 3T The OnePlus 3T is one of the best smartphones on the market this year, especially at its £399 price point. As with its predecessors, the OnePlus 3T offers incredible value for money. It has many of the same features and specifications as smartphones twice its price and its recent launch sees it as one of the most powerful handsets available. The all-metal finish is sleek and sturdy, making it feel like a genuinely premium device and the display is fantastic too, even if it isn't Quad HD resolution. The company may have shied away from the "flagship killer" branding this year, but the OnePlus 3T lays down the marker for what you can get for just under £400. OnePlus 3T review: The best mid-price phone money can buy Buy from Amazon UK, $433 from Amazon US Pocket-lint 3. Apple iPhone 7 The Apple iPhone 7 doesn't offer the overhaul in design that we are used to getting every two years, but there are enough developments to keep fans happy. The new flagship iPhone is more refined, offering the removal of the headphone jack in favour of stereo speakers, along with better hidden antennas and waterproofing. It offers subtle changes to the iPhone 6S, such as a new Home button and glossy or matte black finish options, along with faster and slicker performance, as you would expect. Ultimately, the iPhone 7 is the company's best iPhone yet, as Tim Cook claimed, but the best is only slightly better than the iPhone 6S, which is why we've kept the older model in this list too. Apple iPhone 7 review: Refining the design rather than ripping it up and starting again Buy for £617 from Amazon UK, $715 from Amazon US Pocket-lint 2. Google Pixel Google comes out all guns blazing with two new phones, the Pixel and the larger Pixel XL. Both devices offer the same specs, performance and experience with one difference: screen size. The regular Pixel has a 5-inch Full HD display, while the Pixel XL has a larger 5.5-inch Quad HD display. Launching with a number of exclusive features, but otherwise a clean version of Android, the Pixel phones have a solid build and a fast and smooth experience. The cameras are superb and the battery life is good, leading to a premium Android experience. The price is a little high, however, and they lack microSD or waterproofing. They even have a 3.5mm headphone jack. Google Pixel review, Google Pixel XL review Buy Pixel for £699 from Amazon UK, $705 from Amazon US Buy Pixel XL for £793 from Amazon UK, $989 from Amazon US Pocket-lint 1. Samsung Galaxy S7 edge The flat SGS7 handset is certainly one of the most appealing devices out there, but the S7 edge pips it to the post, taking pole position as the most desirable handset around. The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge fuses power with performance, offering a 5.5-inch display with a Quad HD resolution and plenty of punch, but differentiating itself with those curved edges. The build quality matches the best of the handsets out there and the addition of a microSD card slot makes this handset all the more practical, while the bigger size over the SGS7 gives more space for battery. It's slick and fast and every inch the flagship experience, topped-off with a slick fingerprint scanner and a camera to deliver the whole smartphone package.

Bruce Horovitz, who whote about Super Bowl advertising for many years as a marketing reporter and columnist, writes in the op-ed below that the era of Super Bowl ads that matter is over. (Lexus via AP) Print Email Guest Columnist/cleveland.com By Guest Columnist/cleveland.com The Plain Dealer on February 05, 2017 at 5:30 AM, updated February 05, 2017 at 5:33 AM comments Try to imagine that today: A Super Bowl ad that garners more headlines than a provocative Donald Trump tweet. Bruce Horovitz, is a Cleveland nativeBruce Horovitz  FALLS CHURCH, Virginia -- There was a time when Super Bowl advertising mattered. It mattered to the advertisers. It mattered to the viewers. And, yes, Super Bowl ads once signaled something significant about the zeitgeist of American culture. That time is past. You wouldn't know that, of course, by the near $400 million that 30-plus advertisers are expected to dole out on this year's contest -- at roughly $5 million per 30-second slot. You wouldn't know it by the social media barrage of online Super Bowl ads whose sole purpose is to promote the televised Super Bowl ads. Nor would you know it by the growing litany of media outlets that rank the Super Bowl spots from best to worst. Here's how you know it: You can't name one. Go ahead. Without checking Google or Bing or YouTube, try to recall a single Super Bowl commercial from last year's Big Game. Or for that matter, the year before. Super Bowl ads 2017: What type of commercials can you expect to see? Unless you're in the advertising, marketing or public relations business, I'm betting that you can't. Even if you can somehow remember a 2016 Super Bowl commercial, I'd wager that you can't remember the advertiser who paid for it. It's enough to give every 2017 Super Bowl advertiser angina.   How did this happen? In one word: overload. There's such a constant electronic flood of information, misinformation and irrelevant stuff, that it's now become next to impossible for one Super Bowl advertisement to stand out.   Only a handful accomplished that over the years. Like when Mean Joe Green snatched the Coca-Cola from an adoring fan, chugged it, then tossed the kid his jersey. Or when basketball legends Michael Jordan and Larry Bird played a mythic game of "horse" for a Big Mac. Or when that cute kid, dressed as Darth Vader, thinks he's managed to magically use "the force" to start the VW in the driveway. But no Super Bowl ad comes remotely close to the impact of the one Apple aired in 1984. That's when Apple Computer turned Super Bowl advertising on its head with a commercial for the Apple Macintosh that did what no ad had done before: It left a bigger impression than the game.   The day after the 1984 Super Bowl, when office workers still met around water coolers to discuss the previous day's events, almost no one was talking about the football game -- a 38-9 blowout by the Los Angeles Raiders over the Washington Redskins. They were talking about the "1984" ad. It featured a blond babe running with a sledgehammer, who frees an auditorium full of pathetic captives of a Big Brother figure, by tossing the hammer at a mega-screen that all are watching. When that screen exploded, Super Bowl advertising as we know it exploded, too. Never mind that the ad aired just once on national television. By Apple's internal estimates, it earned more than $150 million in pure PR value -- and that was just the first year. Macintosh sales were super-charged. Try to imagine that today. A Super Bowl ad that stops traffic. A Super Bowl ad that gets more hype than the game. A Super Bowl ad that garners more headlines than a provocative Donald Trump tweet. A sorry state. To stand out at Super Bowl LI, ads are going for stunts Through the years, we've seen and heard it all. We've seen Budweiser frogs and lizards and, yes, way too many beer-trudging Clydesdales. We've seen Danica Patrick incessantly tease us about her turbo-charged sex appeal. We've heard Bob Dylan uncomfortably posing, perhaps, the most inane question of all time in a Chrysler Super Bowl commercial: Is there anything more American than America? We've seen it all -- and we're tired of it. For many Millennials, most of whom are wise to the ways of Madison Avenue, Super Bowl ads are just another effort to get them to purchase unhealthy, environmentally unfriendly or overpriced stuff that they really don't want or need. For many Millennials, Super Bowl ads aren't funny or cute or heartwarming. They're pathetic. To them, a Super Bowl commercial is about as relevant as a Rolodex. Their way of life isn't about sugary drinks, calorie-laden chips and beer -- or the commercials that hype them. It's not that Super Bowl ads don't matter anymore. It's that we've reached a tipping point where they arguably matter more to the advertiser than to the key consumer. Which brings us to Donald Trump. No, not President Trump. But the pre-presidential version, who back in 2012 -- just five years ago -- co-starred in a Century 21 Super Bowl commercial. Of course, you don't remember it. No one -- but, perhaps, Trump himself -- does. It was imminently forgettable -- featuring several other B-list celebs, including former NFL star Deion Sanders and Olympic speedskater Apolo Ohno. Mocking his own role on "The Apprentice," Trump plays the part of a hardheaded home buyer who strikes a tough deal with a savvy Century 21 agent -- only to discover that he's been outsmarted -- and overpaid for the house. "I want a do-over," Trump rants. If only that same line were to air in today's Super Bowl -- with Hillary uttering it. Then, somebody might remember it. 35 epic Super Bowl commercial failures For what it's worth, you won't see Century 21 in this year's Super Bowl. But in Republican-friendly Houston, I'm betting that Trump shows up somewhere. Not in a commercial for beer, soft drinks or software -- but more likely in some sort of self-congratulatory self-promotion. There was, indeed, a time when Super Bowl advertising mattered. But when most folks can't even remember a commercial that starred the future president of the United States, it tells you just one thing.   That time is past. Sad. Bruce Horovitz, a Cleveland native, is a former Los Angeles Times marketing columnist. For 20 years, he was USA Today's lead writer on Super Bowl advertising when he was that paper's marketing reporter. ********** Have something to say about this topic?

Her Excellency Sheikha Lubna Bint Khalid Al Qasimi, Minister of State for Tolerance and President of Zayed University, congratulated Zayed University Students Accessibility Services Department for earning the Apple Distinguished Program recognition, which is reserved for programs that meet criteria for innovation, leadership, and educational excellence. Her Excellency affirmed the significance of supporting students with disabilities and ensuring that all of them regardless of their physical disability or other learning difficulties have access to high quality education and are able to successfully pursue a university-level degree and become fully productive and active members of the UAE community. "It makes me happy and proud to see Zayed University embracing prominent centers equipped with the state-of-the-art educational tools such as, the Humaid Al Tayer's Assistive Technology Resource Center in Abu Dhabi campus and Khalaf Al Habtoor Assistive Technology Resource Center in Dubai Campus. We recall this generous and philanthropic initiative today in 2017, which the UAE wise leadership declared as the 'Year of Giving'," Her Excellency said. Her Excellency also pointed out that both centers provide a wonderful opportunity for students with disabilities to learn and excel personally and professionally, and are committed to delivering high quality services that will benefit students in their academic pursuits and any future endeavors. Professor Reyadh Al Mehaideb, Vice President of Zayed University, praised the achievement that Zayed University Students Accessibility Services Department accomplished through exerting endless efforts to empower students with disabilities and adopting innovative and non-traditional tools, which helped them to become independent, integrate more with their counterparts, and enjoy a better quality of academic life at Zayed University. "The recognition of Zayed University Students Accessibility Services Department as an Apple Distinguished Program highlights our success as an innovative and compelling learning environment that engages students and provides tangible evidence of academic accomplishment," Professor Al Mehaideb added. For her part, Dr Marilyn Roberts, Provost of Zayed University, said: "Since its foundation, Zayed University has been a forward thinking institution. It serves both the academic needs of our students and the community's aspirations. The Students Accessibility Services Department's extensive and effective use of assistive technology is an excellent example of our innovative and creative commitment to serve all students' needs and the community at large. Zayed University is committed to providing students with disabilities the opportunity to be fully integrated in the university in classes and extra-curricular activities." Furthermore, Fatma Al Qassimi, Manager of Students Accessibility Services Department, said: "It is our great pleasure and pride to see Zayed University students with disabilities using the best technical and most advanced services that Apple offers to enable them to perform their mission independently and integrate with their peers similarly." "Zayed University has a unique and distinguished experience in implementing the most progressive technologies to enable students with disabilities to complete their studies and make a meaningful contribution to their local community and to the UAE society as a whole. Additionally, through the use of iOS accessibility features, Zayed University enhanced teaching and learning for students with disabilities, who regularly attend their classes and workshops organized by the Students Accessibility Services Department." Mohja Ibrahim, Specialist at the Students Accessibility Services Department, said: "Zayed University actively promotes the use of iPad to their students with disabilities. iPad allowed me to support students with disabilities, whatever their special needs might be, to communicate in a better way and integrate them into a normal education system to be equal participants in the learning process." The recent technology adoptions in the various academic programs at Zayed University dramatically changed the learning experience for students with disabilities. Omar Al Hashmi, a Zayed University student with visual impairment, said: "I faced various barriers and challenges personally and academically. However, my life changed completely after joining Zayed University. I have received an excellent foundation at the Students Accessibility Services Department. We were trained to use Apple devices, such as MacBook and iPad. I was capable of browsing and reading easily using various applications to enhance the size of the text. I successfully met the learning outcomes like the rest of the students, just in a different way." Al Hashmi added: "With the support of an iPhone currency reader application, I was also able to identify money easily, which is a very challenging task for a visually impaired individual."          ENDS// About Zayed University Zayed University is today the premier national university in the United Arab Emirates and a regional leader in educational innovation and change.

 Apple, IBM, and United Airlines are teaming up to improve your flying experience Benjamin Zhang Feb. 2, 2017, 9:04 AM 9,330 facebook linkedin twitter email print A United Airlines flight attendant with an iPhone.United Airlines Apple, IBM, and United Airlines are teaming up to develop a new generation of mobile apps for the carrier's employees. The new collaborative effort, announced Thursday, is aimed at creating greater levels of functionality for the more than 50,000 Apple iPhones and iPads that United has issued to its flight attendants, gate agents, and other front-line employees. "A partnership with Apple and IBM gives our app-development enterprise scale, reusability, and — most importantly — speed," United Airlines chief information officer Linda Jojo told Business Insider in an interview at the company's Global Leadership Conference in Chicago. "We're going to be able to deliver more tools and technologies faster to our front line than we could if we were building it all ourselves." According to United's top executive in charge of technology, the airline is seeking the input of its front-line employees to determine which functions and features to include in coming apps. "Last week, we had flight attendants and gate agents in Cupertino with our technical team, with IBM, and with Apple," Jojo told us. She added that they were working on software she said would "allow flight attendants to communicate maintenance items discovered on the plane back to the maintenance teams." Rather than be limited by the number of computers at a workstation, the airline can now call in as many people as it needs with these mobile devices in tow to help ease congestion during emergencies and periods of high traffic. Getty Images/Scott Olson "Our employees are now mobile — they're not stuck behind a desk anymore," Jojo said. "At the gate, we now have an agent that can close out a flight, or if there's some kind of problem, they can actually issue boarding passes and bag tags right from a printer that's on their hip, and it's all done from a mobile device." The United Airlines announcement is the latest development in the partnership IBM and Apple entered into in 2014 seeking to revolutionize enterprise mobile apps. "We wanted to have the best devices in the hands of our employees," Jojo said regarding the decision to equip customer-service representatives with Apple iPhones. In fact, it was one of the first decisions the executive made after joining the airline as CIO in 2014. REUTERS/Louis Nastro Since then, the airline's internal tech team has been hard at work building tools for the devices. United understands that it can always use some extra workers and expertise. That's where the tech firm formerly known as "Big Blue" steps in. "While we are quite good" at app development, Jojo said, "it takes time." "And IBM really understands how to build systems at scale and for enterprises," she said. In 2011, the airline's flight crews received iPads to serve as digital maps, charts, and navigation tools — replacing clunky pilot bags that weighed as much as 45 pounds. United issued iPhones to flight attendants and gate agents in 2014 and 2015.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India Elections World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Budget 2017 Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Companies Apple's reign ended: Google takes over as the world's most valuable brand It's time for a new king! Sami Khan   February 5, 2017 15:05 IST GoogleReuters For five years, Apple has maintained dominance and kept the crown for being the world's most valuable brand. In the New Year, everything changes. A new king has arrived and it takes pride in becoming the world's most valuable brand for the first time since 2011. It's none other than Google, the largest internet search titan, at a valuation of $109.4 billion, Brand Finance's Global 500 2017 report [PDF] revealed. Apple, on the other hand, slipped from the top position after its brand value fell 27 percent to $107.1 billion since the beginning of last year. The reason behind this appears to be the Cupertino-based tech giant's sloppy product line. The company was at the forefront of innovation once, but has lost its touch as there is no unique product in offing. Apple's slow pace against its competitors' continued growth has highlighted the lack of innovation on Apple's end, the report says. But that hasn't affected the company's profits as the robust sales of the latest iPhone 7 series contributed $17.9 billion in quarterly earnings during the period ending December 31. Compared to last year, Apple lost 2.7 percent from its net income of $18.4 billion, which signals a downward trend. Will Apple be able to turn the tables around this year with its much-awaited iPhone 8? It's a whole different story and we can't wait to find out. While Apple sits on the number two spot, Google's lucrative business has pushed the brand to numero uno. Google's parent company Alphabet reported net income of $5.33 billion in Q4, largely steered by mobile search, video ads and the company's foray into new businesses like cloud computing. The company's revenue skyrocketed 22 percent to $26 billion during the quarter. Following Google and Apple's lead are Amazon, AT&T and Microsoft in the third, fourth and fifth positions respectively.

The U.S. company has tapped Taiwan's Wistron Corp. to put together its phones in the tech capital of Bangalore in Karnataka, said Priyank Kharge, the state's information technology minister. Apple executives met with him in January and confirmed the timeline, he said in an interview. The start of iPhone assembly in India comes after months of speculation on Apple's plan for the market, which is led by rival Samsung Electronics. It signals a renewed focus on the country, where it just scrapes into the top 10, as growth begins to slow in China and other more mature markets. The Cupertino, California-based company is said to have put forward a long list of demands in negotiations with India's federal government, including a 15-year tax holiday to import components and equipment. "Apple's iPhones will be made in Bangalore and all devices will be targeted at the domestic market," said Kharge, IT minister for Karnataka, of which Bangalore is the capital. Kharge said the state will help Apple if it decides to turn to other contract manufacturers in the region. "We did not discuss any other incentives," he said.

Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said on an earnings call this week that India is "the place to be." He visited the country for the first time last May as he sought government approval for Apple to open its own stores - a step the company deems critical to growing the iPhone user base across the country. Over the long run however, Apple needs to meet requirements that single-brand retailers source 30 percent of components from within India. Manufacturing locally will help with that. Making iPhones locally could also score brownie points with the national government. Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants companies to make products in the country as part of his "Make in India" policy, aimed at reaping the benefits that come from manufacturing facilities and jobs. The company shipped 2.5 million iPhones into the country in 2016. While that was its best year ever in terms of revenues and sales, it only ranked 10th among vendors in the December quarter according to Counterpoint Research. Apple accounts for less than 2 percent of shipments in India, where an estimated 750 million smartphones will be sold by 2020. While Indian consumers currently buy mainly cheaper devices made by Samsung and Chinese brands such as Oppo, Apple believes rising incomes will make the premium-priced iPhone more attractive over time. Apple doesn't manufacture devices itself, but rather partners with contract manufacturers to handle the capital intensive demands of building factories and hiring staff. Its Indian phones will be assembled through a plant on Bangalore's outskirts operated by Wistron, a Taiwanese contract manufacturer, bypassing usual partners such as Hon Hai Precision Industry. Hon Hai, the main listed arm of Taiwan's Foxconn Technology Group, is said to be an option in future. "In the longer term, it's a great move," Cook said on this week's post-earnings call. "We are in discussions on a number of things, including retail stores, and fully intend to invest significantly in the country."

Saturday 11 Feb 2017 / Tehran - 12:55 / GMT - 09:25 Old FNA Old FNA                 Advanced Search Ar  | En  | Fa  | Tr Home Politico-Defense Politics  - Foreign Policy  - Defense  - Nuclear   Economy Society & Culture Society  - Sport  - Culture  - Art  - Life Style   Sci-Tech Space  - Nano  - Medicine  - Technology  - Earth   World Interviews & Commentaries Interviews  - Commentaries   Multimedia Photo  - Video   All Stories Sci-Tech http://fna.ir/1B1UVB Sun Feb 05, 2017 12:34 iPhone 8 vs Galaxy S8: Apple & Samsung Fight for Smartphone Dominance Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- 2017 is shaping up to be the biggest year for smartphone consumers in years with both Apple and Samsung leading the way. Both companies have a lot to prove, and from the looks of things, they are working overtime to create groundbreaking phones. According to CNN, Apple shares are soaring from the new iPhone hype. “Shares of the iPhone maker surged 6% on Wednesday to their highest level since July 2015. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) is now up an impressive 11% so far this year, blowing past the rest of the stock market.” The article adds that not only did Apple post its first sales increase in a year, but Tim Cook also sent positive signals about demand heading into the release of the iPhone 8, which has excited investors, due later this year. One of the biggest features of the new iPhone 8 could be inductive wireless charging. “Over the course of the last year, there has been ongoing speculation that wireless charging company Energous has inked a deal with Apple and could potentially provide wireless charging technology for the upcoming iPhone 8,” says columnist Juli Clover, who adds that a new investor’s note from Copperfield Research outlines why Apple has no plans to use Energous’ WattUp radio frequency-based wireless charging solution. This is good news for many people since Apple has been working on wireless charging solutions for years. However, wireless charging will likely be just one of the many new innovative features on the upcoming iPhone. According to 9to5Mac, we may also see 4.7-inch to 5.8-inch curved OLED displays, an all-glass design with new colors, an embedded (into the screen) home button, and something that has to do with augmented reality. It has been reported that Apple has been working with Carl Zeiss on augmented reality glasses that may be used in conjunction with the iPhone. Apple will certainly have to come up with the goods, especially since Samsung will get a head start in the market. According to Tech Radar, the S8 will be officially unveiled on March 29 and possibly be released on April 21. In the past, Samsung has usually uncovered their new Galaxy S8 smartphones at the end of February at the annual Mobile World Congress event. Perhaps Samsung is just making sure they get things right; after the Note 7 debacle, they certainly can’t afford another recall. Tech Radar has also summarized the likely highlights of the S8 in another article. “Likely highlights include a 4K screen, a Snapdragon 830 processor, 6GB of RAM and a massively improved camera. There’s even a chance that the Samsung Galaxy S8 will have an iris scanner or a foldable screen, though the latter is somewhat less likely.” The article confirms that there will be two different versions of the S8, and both will come with curved screens. One could be a 5.7-inch regular version, and the other, the one that would have the 4K screen, will be 6.1 inches. The S8 could also have a 30MP dual-lens rear camera and an 8MP front camera. SamMobile has new information on the battery that will be used in the Galaxy S8. “Local media reports out of South Korea suggest that Samsung has decided to source the Galaxy S8 battery from Murata Manufacturing Works in Japan. It took over Sony’s battery business in June last year and will function as the supplier for Galaxy S8 batteries.” Based on all the reports, which smartphone are you most excited about — the iPhone 8 or the Galaxy S8?

Picture by Brian Little 07:57 Sunday 05 February 2017 0 Have your say Next Monday, February 6, is the start of Bramley Apple Week where we’re encouraged to rediscover and embrace this national treasure. The first Bramley apple tree was grown in 1809 from pips planted by a young girl called Mary Ann Brailsford at her home in Southwell in Nottinghamshire. A butcher named Matthew Bramley bought the house and garden in 1846. Local nursery man Henry Merryweather asked to take some cuttings from the tree to sell and Matthew agreed provided the tree was known as the Bramley. In 1883, a Mr Nicolson of Cranagill House in Co Armagh, bought 60 seedlings from Henry. At this stage there were over 100 different varieties of apple tree growing in the county. The Bramley thrived in Armagh – thankfully it’s a fruit that likes a good dousing of rain all year round. As it flourished, it usurped the other apples growing in the region and is now the most commonly available apple. In 2012 it was awarded Protected Geographical Indication ( PGI ) status making it an iconic protected product, alongside other legendary foods like English Stilton cheese and Italian Parma ham. Bramley apples need a liberal lashing of sugar to take away their natural tartness. One of my favourite childhood memories is watching my mother make an apple tart and being allowed to dip pieces of the sharp fruit into the sugar bowl. I still adore apple tart, especially warm from the oven, it’s crisp pastry giving way to sweet, soft and sharp fruit. A lot of chefs prefer to use Granny Smith apples when they need sharpness as they hold their shape better when cooked, as the Bramley tends to go mushy. The chef Gordon Ramsay got into a bit of trouble many years ago when he was commissioned to do Bramley recipes. He substituted them for French Granny Smith citing that they were easier to cook with, and a huge row erupted with protests outside his restaurant in Chelsea. The Bramley is only grown in Britain and you can understand the growers, who were paying him royally, for their raised blood pressure. For me, the fact that it goes a bit squishy only adds to the character of this unique fruit. Warm apple sponge, crunchy apple crumble and apple charlotte are all perfect ways of serving bramleys as a pudding but they’re versatile as an accompaniment to savoury dishes too. Tart apples are the perfect foil for fatty meats – hence pork and apple sauce, but they also work well with roast duck and provide a zingy foil to oily fish like mackerel, eel or salmon. There are many fine artisan cider makers in Northern Ireland who use the Bramley in their production to great effect. It gives a unique crispness to their drinks. My two recipes this week use both Armagh Bramley apples and cider. The first is for an apple pudding with a layer of apple jelly, topped with sliced apples and then baked with a cider sponge. There are many apple jelly makers here who preserve the precious orchard harvest – local butchers and delis provincewide stock their products. The second recipe is for pork shoulder, slowly cooked with cider, fennel, rosemary and garlic, shredded and served in a bun with a zingy apple and red cabbage slaw. I’m over the whole pulled pork carry on but this takes great local ingredients to another level. We sometimes take the wonderful things on our doorstep for granted so this  is the perfect week to embrace our delicious national fruit.

Related Can Apple iPhone's be 'made in America', as Donald Trump suggests? Apple ditches 'activation lock' tool for iPhones Apple iPhone production in Bengaluru to commence soon', so read a notification from PM Narendra Modi's official app. Thus almost 'confirming' Cupertino giant Apple's iPhone manufacturing plans in India. Though the app mentions 'International Business Times' website as source of the news, the notification from PM Modi's app to its users is the biggest confirmation so far about Apple setting up iPhone assembly plant in India. Earlier this week, the government of the Karnataka in a statement had welcomed Apple's proposal to begin initial manufacturing operations in Bengaluru, hinting that it is moving forward to the plans to assemble iPhones in India. "Apple's intentions to manufacture in Bengaluru will foster a cutting edge technology ecosystem and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally," the state government had said in the statement. Karnataka IT minister Priyank Kharge had told Reuters (on February 2) he believes that Apple will "tentatively begin manufacturing iPhones in the state by the end of April, or beginning of May." However, no agreement or memorandum of understanding is said to have has been finalised or signed between the state or the Union government. India will be the third country globally to assemble iPhones, an indication of how important it has become for one of the world's most valued companies. The buzz about Apple setting up assembly plant in India started in May 2016 during CEO Tim Cook's first-ever India visit. PM Modi is said to have then asked Apple CEO to look at the possibility of making its devices in India. During Cook's visit, Apple had also announced setting up of a design and development accelerator in the city to grow the iOS developer community and also guide Indian developers to leverage Apple's programming language Swift and build apps for Apple TV and Apple Watch.

The source, who asked not to be named because he was not cleared to discuss matters publicly, said Apple and the Indian government were, however, still discussing “the repatriation of long-term profits from local sales and exports.” The government of the Indian state of Karnataka said on Thursday it welcomed Apple’s proposal to begin initial manufacturing operations in tech hub Bengaluru, its state capital, hinting it is moving forward with plans to assemble iPhones in India. “Apple’s intentions to manufacture in Bengaluru will foster a cutting edge technology ecosystem and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally,” the Karnataka government said in a statement. Karnataka IT Minister Priyank Kharge told Reuters on Friday he believes Apple will “tentatively begin manufacturing iPhones in the state by the end of April, or beginning of May.” A second source familiar with matters told Reuters, however, that no agreement, or memorandum of understanding has so far been finalised with the Karnataka government. The person, who also asked not to be named, said if Apple did go ahead with plans to begin assembling the iPhone, it was likely to do so initially at the plant being set up by Wistron at Peenya on the outskirts of Bengaluru. Apple was not immediately reachable for comment. Joyce Chou, a spokeswoman for Wistron, said its Bengaluru plant is expected to begin producing smartphones some time in the first half of 2017. She declined to comment on whether it would be a captive iPhone assembly site. Cupertino, California-based Apple, is keen to assemble its phones in India, one of the world’s fastest growing smartphone markets. Apple representatives met federal and state government officials in India last week, as it is lobbies hard for tax and sourcing concessions before it begins to assemble iPhones there. Apple described its discussions with Indian officials as open and constructive. Any final decision on manufacturing in India is, however, likely to depend on the government’s willingness to concede ground on the concessions Apple seeks. Last month, Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said India would consider Apple’s request for incentives with an “open mind.” Reuters Tags: Apple, Bengaluru, iPhone, Karnataka, Wistron Also read Wistron enters supply chain of Apple’s iPhone 5se: Report Apple’s parts supplier Wistron looking for permission to expand in Bengaluru X Recommended For You Analyst predicts that the upcoming Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 7s models will have wireless charging WhatsApp rolls out ‘Two-Step Verification’ for everyone; Here is why it is important Apple iCloud stores deleted browsing history almost indefinitely, analyst Trump immigration ban: “If we stand and say nothing, we become a part of it,” Apple CEO Tim Cook Subscribe to our newsletter GO You are Now Subscribed to our Newsletter - Stay Tuned !

Though the app mentions 'International Business Times' website as source of the news, the notification from PM Modi's app to its users is the biggest confirmation so far about Apple setting up iPhone assembly plant in India. Earlier this week, the government of the Karnataka in a statement had welcomed Apple's proposal to begin initial manufacturing operations in Bengaluru, hinting that it is moving forward to the plans to assemble iPhones in India. View As Photolist » 5 things Apple CEO Tim Cook said about India during Q1 results conference 16 5 things Apple CEO Tim Cook said about India during Q1 results conference After five-long years, Apple reclaimed its position as the world's top smartphone maker in the fourth quarter of the year 2016. The company beat Samsung to make its claim to the top spot. India too played an impressive role during the quarter, making Apple CEO Tim Cook reiterate his commitment to the Indian market. Here's all that CEO Tim Cook said about India during the company's Q4 earning's call. Demonetisation a great move Apple CEO Tim Cook hailed PM Narendra Modi's demonetisation. The demonetisation drive undertaken by the Indian government is a "great move" in the longer term, Apple CEO said. "It's still definitely having some overhang. But I think in the longer term, it's a great move...," he added. Cash ban blues? Apple reports best-ever quarter in India Despite the cash ban, the US-based iPhone maker performed well in the Indian market. According to a report in economic times, iPhone sales shot up in India in the three days immediately following demonetisation as consumers rushed to buy these devices with their phased-out high-denomination notes and stores booked sales through back-dated receipts. As per trade estimates, over 1 lakh iPhones were sold in these three days, which is around three-fourth of this handset’s average monthly sales. "Despite the demonetisation move in India that created lots of economic pressure there last quarter, despite that, we had all-time record revenue results, and so we were very happy about that," Cook said during the earnings call when asked about the companys performance in India. Apple India revenues grow 56% year-on-year Apple India clocked Rs 9,997 crore in sales in 2015-16, up 56% from Rs 6,472 crore in the year before, as per the company. To make significant investments in India CEO Cook reiterated Apple's commitment to investing in India and added that the company is in talks with the government to open retail stores. "We are in discussions on a number of things, including retail stores, and fully intend to invest significantly in the country and believe it's a great place to be," he said. iPads shining sales growing in India Apple CEO said that while tablet sales have been declining globally, India saw growth. "We posted double-digit growth in both Mainland China and India, as we have expanded distribution channels in those countries and we continue to attract a very high percentage of first-time tablet buyers," he said. "Apple's intentions to manufacture in Bengaluru will foster a cutting edge technology ecosystem and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally," the state government had said in the statement. Karnataka IT minister Priyank Kharge had told Reuters (on February 2) he believes that Apple will "tentatively begin manufacturing iPhones in the state by the end of April, or beginning of May." However, no agreement or memorandum of understanding is said to have has been finalised or signed between the state or the Union government. Apple is said to have exclusively tied up Taiwan-based Original Equipment Maker (OEM) Wistron to assemble iPhones in India. The company is reported to make the iPhones out of its facility in the Bengaluru's industrial hub of Peenya. READ ALSO: Apple sets new 'restrictions' for its retailers in India India will be the third country globally to assemble iPhones, an indication of how important it has become for one of the world's most valued companies. The buzz about Apple setting up assembly plant in India started in May 2016 during CEO Tim Cook's first-ever India visit. PM Modi is said to have then asked Apple CEO to look at the possibility of making its devices in India.

Picture: BLOOMBERG/KRISZTIAN BOCSI Alphabet Inc. warned investors about a slew of new competitors, highlighting the company’s broad expansion beyond its original Google search business. Alphabet named rivals including Apple, Netflix and Hulu, while highlighting risks from new businesses such as consumer hardware manufacturing, according to its latest annual report filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday. Here are the top new competitive disclosures, gleaned from a comparison between Alphabet’s latest annual report and the filing from a year earlier: — "Providers of digital video services, such as Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu." Google’s YouTube has new paid subscription versions of its online video offering that compete more directly with the latter three companies. Executives were cautiously optimistic about this on an earnings call last week. "[It] takes a while to build a subscription business here," Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said. — "Digital assistant providers, such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft." Last year, the company launched its Google Assistant, a voice-based information service that Google hopes to embed in as many devices as possible. That competes against Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa and Microsoft’s Cortana. Facebook has a similar service in its Messenger app. — "Providers of enterprise cloud services, including Amazon and Microsoft." This refers to Google’s cloud computing business, which executive Diane Greene is finally turning into a serious service for larger corporate customers. Alphabet mentioned the cloud in previous annual reports, but the focus on enterprise is new. — "Companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer electronics products." This likely refers to Google’s new suite of gadgets, including the Pixel phone and Home speaker. The phone makes it a rival to Apple, and Android device makers like Samsung Electronics. Speaking of hardware, Alphabet’s latest annual report highlighted new manufacturing and supply-chain risks related to its in-house gadget push. "We may enter into long term contracts that commit us to significant terms and conditions of supply. We may be liable for material and product that is not consumed due to market acceptance, technological change, obsolescences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues," the company wrote. Alphabet also disclosed the cost of marketing these new devices to potential buyers. Total sales and marketing expenses increased by more than $1.4bn from 2015 to 2016 — mainly due to a $679m jump in advertising and promotional costs for Google’s hardware products, the filing said.

Both companies have a lot to prove, and from the looks of things, they are working overtime to create groundbreaking phones. According to CNN, Apple shares are soaring from the new iPhone hype. The hype over the iPhone 8 has helped Apple’s shares rise. [Image by Bryan Thomas/Getty Images] “Shares of the iPhone maker surged 6% on Wednesday to their highest level since July 2015. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) is now up an impressive 11% so far this year, blowing past the rest of the stock market.” The article adds that not only did Apple post its first sales increase in a year, but Tim Cook also sent positive signals about demand heading into the release of the iPhone 8, which has excited investors, due later this year. One of the biggest features of the new iPhone 8 could be inductive wireless charging. “Over the course of the last year, there has been ongoing speculation that wireless charging company Energous has inked a deal with Apple and could potentially provide wireless charging technology for the upcoming iPhone 8,” says columnist Juli Clover, who adds that a new investor’s note from Copperfield Research outlines why Apple has no plans to use Energous’ WattUp radio frequency-based wireless charging solution. This is good news for many people since Apple has been working on wireless charging solutions for years. However, wireless charging will likely be just one of the many new innovative features on the upcoming iPhone. According to 9to5Mac, we may also see 4.7-inch to 5.8-inch curved OLED displays, an all-glass design with new colors, an embedded (into the screen) home button, and something that has to do with augmented reality. It has been reported that Apple has been working with Carl Zeiss on augmented reality glasses that may be used in conjunction with the iPhone. Samsung doesn’t want a repeat of the Galaxy Note 7 disaster. [Image by Daryl Deino] Apple will certainly have to come up with the goods, especially since Samsung will get a head start in the market. According to Tech Radar, the S8 will be officially unveiled on March 29 and possibly be released on April 21. In the past, Samsung has usually uncovered their new Galaxy S8 smartphones at the end of February at the annual Mobile World Congress event. Perhaps Samsung is just making sure they get things right; after the Note 7 debacle, they certainly can’t afford another recall. Tech Radar has also summarized the likely highlights of the S8 in another article. “Likely highlights include a 4K screen, a Snapdragon 830 processor, 6GB of RAM and a massively improved camera. There’s even a chance that the Samsung Galaxy S8 will have an iris scanner or a foldable screen, though the latter is somewhat less likely.” The article confirms that there will be two different versions of the S8, and both will come with curved screens. One could be a 5.7-inch regular version, and the other, the one that would have the 4K screen, will be 6.1 inches. The S8 could also have a 30MP dual-lens rear camera and an 8MP front camera. SamMobile has new information on the battery that will be used in the Galaxy S8. “Local media reports out of South Korea suggest that Samsung has decided to source the Galaxy S8 battery from Murata Manufacturing Works in Japan. It took over Sony’s battery business in June last year and will function as the supplier for Galaxy S8 batteries.” Based on all the reports, which smartphone are you most excited about — the iPhone 8 or the Galaxy S8?

With avid fans and professional users demanding more from the Cupertino-based tech giant’s most powerful notebook line, rumors are high that Apple might very well address all the MacBook Pro’s issues this 2017. If speculations prove true, a 32GB RAM, Kaby Lake MBP could be set for release later this year. The 2016 MacBook Pro was the first real upgrade to Apple’s esteemed professional-grade laptop line in years. After holding out on a redesign and a major update for the year, the Cupertino-based tech giant opted to roll out a number of radical changes to its most iconic laptop last October. Despite the 2016 MacBook Pro’s innovative new features, however, the powerful device was met with mixed reviews from longtime Apple fans and critics alike. [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] One of the main reasons behind the 2016 MacBook Pro’s criticisms is the device’s raw specs. Powered by an aging Intel Skylake processor and capping off its RAM at 16GB, many felt that the device’s premium price point was largely unwarranted. Coupled with a hate-it-or-like-it keyboard and a lack of USB-A ports, the MacBook Pro 2016 appeared for the most part like an upgraded version of the controversial 12-inch MacBook, which was introduced a couple years ago. If rumors are true, however, 2017 could finally be the year when Apple’s MacBook Pro would once more be worthy of its moniker. Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst at KGI Securities and one of the most reputable sources for Apple leaks in the industry, has weighed in on the future of the MacBook Pro in a MacRumors report. According to the esteemed analyst, Apple’s power laptop would see a notable upgrade to its internals in 2017, coupled with a significant price cut for the 2016 models. Headlining the speculated MacBook Pro 2017 upgrades is the actual inclusion of a Kaby Lake chip and support for up to 32GB of RAM. A Kaby Lake chip makes perfect sense for Apple’s most powerful laptop since its aging processor could be considered as one of the 2016 MacBook Pro’s most notable weaknesses. By upgrading the flagship laptop to Intel’s powerful Kaby Lake processors, the 2017 MacBook Pro would finally have enough processing power to justify its fairly high price. After all, practically all of the MacBook Pro’s Windows-powered rivals have already embraced Kaby Lake chips since last year. Thus, with the adoption of Intel’s seventh-generation chips, Apple would effectively be catching up to the competition. [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] Among the most notable predictions from Kuo that has managed to get the full attention of fans is the 2017 MacBook Pro’s support for up to 32GB of RAM. When the current generation MBPs launched last October, power users who delve into video editing and heavy graphics processing were largely disappointed that Apple’s flagship laptop caps off at 16GB of memory. While 16GB of RAM is adequate for most tasks, it could prove inadequate when intensive, professional-grade applications are being run. With 32GB of RAM, however, processing becomes a completely different story, according to a MacWorld report. Lastly, one of the most recent rumors about the 2017 MacBook Pro is the idea that the powerful laptop would be equipped with a special chip designed by Apple itself. This chip, internally code-named as the T310 processor, is speculated to handle the MacBook Pro 2017’s low-power tasks, such as email updates, while the laptop is in Sleep mode. This rumored chip is a variant of the custom processor powering the MacBook Pro 2016’s Touch Bar. By utilizing a highly efficient chip for the upcoming flagship laptop’s low-power tasks, Apple would be able to create a laptop that is truly power-efficient. The 2017 MacBook Pro might very well be what the 2016 MacBook Pro was supposed to be. Apple’s MBP line for 2016, while revolutionary in their own right, just had far too many compromises to make it a justifiable purchase for numerous Apple fans and everyday consumers alike. Considering the rumors surrounding the 2017 MacBook Pro, however, it appears that Apple is finally catching up to the competition and making a laptop that is both powerful and worthy of its premium price.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley’s Project Jupiter up for approval Saturday Feb 4, 2017 at 5:34 PM Feb 4, 2017 at 5:50 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — The Town Council will hold a special meeting to vote on approval of the covertly dubbed Project Jupiter, a distribution center set to be built on 106 acres within the town’s northern borders. In addition to approving the project — a move that would clear the way for the developer to submit a building plan — a resolution to be considered Tuesday would first deny an appeal of Lozeau Drury LLP that alleges the project requires its own Environmental Impact Report, according to town documents. The appeal relates to the California Environmental Quality Act review of the project, which includes a certified EIR for the North Apple Valley Industrial Specific Plan and a supplemental Mitigated Negative Declaration prepared specifically for the project, according to Assistant Town Manager Lori Lamson. The MND was approved by the Planning Commission director in late 2016, town documents show, but the appeal contends the project may have a significant effect on traffic, biological resources and air quality, thus requiring a new EIR. The Planning Commission denied the appeal earlier this month. Town officials have withheld the name of the distribution center’s future occupant both in documents and in public, but it’s widely believed the facility will be the new home of discount retailer Big Lots. The company previously confirmed its consideration of moving its Rancho Cucamonga-based distribution center “30 or 40 miles north of its current location,” and town documents list Todd Noethen — Vice President of Distribution Support Services for Big Lots, according to his LinkedIn account — as the project sponsor. On Saturday, Town spokeswoman Kathie Martin told the Daily Press that Jupiter remains the official word for the project, as shown in the meeting’s agenda. “The Owner Participation Agreement is between the town and Apple Valley Distribution Center, LLC,” Martin said. “Following the lead of the client, we still omit the name of the end-user.” During a discussion of the project last February, Town Manager Frank Robinson said he could not elaborate on the company that would occupy the building, but he coyly remarked it would be built on a “big lot,” leading the Daily Press to describe the project, at the time, as the “worst-kept secret in the High Desert.” The 1.3-million-square-foot facility, which would be slightly larger than the adjacent Wal-Mart Distribution Center, is expected to employ between 400 and 500 people when it’s operational. Construction of the facility near Navajo Road and LaFayette Street — north of the Apple Valley Airport — will employ another 300 workers. The project is expected to earn the town $2.8 million in development impact fee payments and an estimated annual property tax revenue of more than $600,000, according to previous Daily Press reports. The resolution before the Town Council on Tuesday is also expected to adopt the MND and approve a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program, according to the agenda. Town officials have said the distribution center would help expand infrastructure improvements and act as a catalyst in attracting more industrial firms to north Apple Valley. A second appeal filed by the Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance was rejected by the town because application fees weren’t paid in a timely manner. The alliance may still provide comment during the meeting, though. The meeting, which is open to the public, will be held at 6:30 inside Council chambers. Town Hall is located at 14955 Dale Evans Parkway. Visit www.applevalley.org/services/town-clerk/agendas/february-7-2017-special-meeting for more information.

Google vs. Apple: Which Maps App Should You be Using? Bethany Cleg Photographer, Entrepreneur Share More Tweet Share Save Share Stumble Email Google vs. Apple: Which Maps App Should You be Using? Bethany Cleg Photographer, Entrepreneur | If you’re an everyday maps user, you’ll know that this technology is crucial to your daily commute. In the past few years, technology has becoming an increasingly popular addition to the driving experience. From the ever-popular online driving courses to digital maps, technology has changed the face of driving forever. That’s why Apple’s release of its own map app has caused such an upset. Beginning with the iOS 6, Apple phones will no longer have Google Maps but will feature Apple’s own map application. Shortly after this development, Google announced an update to its own maps to keep things competitive. This raises one important question: which map is the best? Public Transportation While Apple is marketing a different product, it seems that they have taken a couple of pages from Google. Apple’s map features a turn-by-turn navigation style that is identical to Google’s. The application also uses a traffic viewer to help users see faster routes and uses traffic reports to change routes that have slowed due to traffic. While all of these features are nice, they are also the standard that Google Maps has set. One thing that Apple lacks, however, is an option for travel by public transportation. This is a large weakness that alienates a large section of Apple’s urban audience, so why did they choose not to include it? Well, most cities offer their public transportation routes through GTFS, or General Transit Data Feed. While this service is completely free to use, it was also engineered by Google, which is likely why Apple will not be using it in their own application. Siri Apple should get a leg up on Google thanks to Siri, right? Siri is able to provide users with information like where to find nearby restaurants or gas stations as well as an estimated time of arrival. While Siri has become a popular feature of Apple products, it functions very much like a normal GPS in this regard. While Siri is a solid addition to Apple’s map application, it does not do much more than any other GPS app on the market. Nearby Search Both Google and Apple have a feature that allows users to look up local restaurants and businesses near them. Apple does have a particular edge in this area, though. Apple’s search not only shows the basic results, it also includes Yelp reviews. This means that Apple users can read reviews of various restaurants before deciding to go anywhere, which is a major plus in terms of convenience. Bird’s Eye View The newest innovation has been for map applications to offer a bird’s eye view of a location. Google recently added what it calls “Tour Guide,” while Apple refers to its program as “3D Flyover.” In short, these features do virtually the same thing. They offer a view of a location from above to help in navigating the area. There is a slight performance difference in Apple’s favor, however. Apple’s 3D Flyover offers much more intense details than Google’s Tour Guide, and the images are created in real-time without sacrificing stunning visual details. Given Apple’s history, it is no surprise that the company has an edge here. In the past three years, Apple took over several mapping companies, two of which specialized in 3D modeling. With these new acquisitions, it is logical that they would offer a better 3D service than Google. Final Verdict It is impossible to deny that Apple took a lot of the amazing features from Google Maps without really altering them at all. From turn-by-turn navigation to classic search features, Apple functions in much the same way as any traditional GPS application. There are some differences, however, and they are worth taking note of. By not including public transportation, Apple’s map feature will likely be far less useful than Google Maps to users who live in large cities. On the flip side, there are other areas in which Apple excels. Apple’s 3D rendering of a landscape is ideal for anybody planning any kind of road trip and offers far superior navigation compared with Google’s. For this reason, Apple wins among consumers who find themselves traveling a lot. Each application has strengths and weaknesses, and ultimately the victor is decided by personal preference and unique user needs.

Please enter the valid email address. Apple will assemble the iPhone in India from the end of April. In an interview with India's Information Technology Minister Priyank Kharge on Monday (April 3), Bloomberg reported that Apple plans to assemble the iPhone in Bangalore, India. Apple has partnered with a Taiwanese company, Wistron, to assemble it in India. Kharge said he met with Apple executives in January to tune the schedule. Indian press Indian Express says that Wistron has a factory in Peenya, Bangalore. The company said that the iPhone will be assembled at the Wistron Bangalore plant, rather than planting the plant. Advertisement Kharge said it takes about three months to complete the facilities needed for assembly. The details of the production plan, such as the initial production scale, were not mentioned. Bloomberg said the iPhone production plan was decided after several months of market research. The fact that Samsung is leading the Indian market has also influenced local production decisions. Apple ranks 10th in the Indian smartphone market. Samsung and Chinese companies are leading the smartphone market in China. Apple is focusing on fast-growing India as smartphone market growth slows in China and other countries. The Indian government is also trying to score points. As part of the 'Make in India' policy, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants various companies to make products in India. Advertisement In November last year, Apple sent a letter asking for incentives when local production of the iPhone was completed in India. "Every iPhone produced in India is for the domestic market," said Kaji. "If Apple contracts with other manufacturers in Bangalore, it will help Apple." He added that he did not discuss other incentives. Apple did not answer questions.

Emily Fortuna / Twitter Share Share Tweet Share Comment Email Print advertisement Business is anything but usual for some of America's largest companies, as they question — or blatantly decry — President Trump's immigration ban. Google, Amazon, Starbucks, and Facebook are just a few of the big names to have stepped forward and denounce Trump's executive order, which restricts the entry of refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, and indefinitely bans Syrian refugees altogether. In the latest scuffle, Apple CEO Tim Cook told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday his company was considering taking legal action to have Trump's executive order reversed, noting that hundreds of Apple staff had been affected by the travel ban. "More than any country in the world, this country is strong because of our immigrant background and our capacity and ability as people to welcome people from all kinds of backgrounds," Cook told the WSJ. "That's what makes us special. We ought to pause and really think deeply through that." The following Fortune 500 companies have either publicly challenged or expressed concern over the order: Amazon Apple Citigroup Expedia Facebook Ford Goldman Sachs Alphabet Intel JPMorgan Chase MasterCard Microsoft Netflix Nike Procter & Gamble Salesforce Twitter, Square, Airbnb, Github, Etsy, Lyft, Uber, Tesla, and TripAdvisor have also protested the ban, as have pharmaceutical companies sych as Allergan and Perlara. Actions Speak Louder Than Words With so many firms lending their voice to the cause, it must be asked: Is each company genuinely invested in seeing the ban dissolved because of their values — or are some brands just riding the wave of a big marketing moment? The answer is multi-faceted: On one hand, any U.S. company speaking out against the president is taking a risk; on the other hand, it comes down to what actions these brands take beyond their statements. "A lot of people do approve the ban, so these companies are taking a risk just by taking a stance against it," said Margaret Wolfson, founder and creative director at River + Wolf. "But there seem to be three levels involved: The first is in making a statement that brands you as a compassionate believer in American values; the second is in employers looking out for their employees so they feel protected, and the third level — the hardest of all because of the logistics it entails — is going beyond the verbal to the visceral and investing time, energy, and money." Google, Starbucks, Lyft, and Airbnb, are among those companies putting their money where their values are, so to speak. Related: Silicon Valley Has Visceral Reaction to Trump's Ban "We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the United States," a Google spokesperson told NBC News. "We'll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere." To make its views not only known, but felt, Google created a $4 million crisis fund for those affected by the ban, pledging $2 million that can be matched by up to $2 million from employees to fund organizations such as the ACLU and the International Rescue Committee. Starbucks announced it was developing plans to hire 10,000 refugees over five years in the 75 countries around the world where Starbucks operates. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment, instead referring to chairman and CEO Howard Schultz's public letter to Starbucks partners. Lyft has pledged to donate $1 million to the ACLU over the next four years. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment beyond co-founder and CEO Logan Green's three tweets and Lyft's ACLU blog post. Soon after the ban was issued, Airbnb announced that it would provide free temporary housing to refugees and others impacted by the ban. "This initiative is a part of Airbnb's longstanding commitment to addressing the needs of refugees," said an Airbnb spokesperson, citing the company's past pledge to match up to $1 million donations to UNHCR. Also to be noted is Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos' assertion that Amazon is prepared to support a lawsuit against Trump and his administration over the order, while Twitter's Jack Dorsey released a short film about Syrian refugee and entrepreneur Yassin Tehrou. Thinking on a Global Level Companies campaigning against the ban may not only be looking to protect American values, but their global relationships as well. "A lot of organizations that have and will come out against [Trump's ban] are global firms that need support in other parts of the world," said Ronald Hill, a professor of marketing and business law at Villanova School of Business. "I wouldn't be surprised if global firms coming out against it do business in areas such as Western Europe that have high Muslim populations. You have to think from a global and not just a local perspective." Hill anticipates that more businesses will be chiming in against the ban, particularly those that have a history of prioritizing corporate social responsibility — despite the backlash they may receive. "Some fashion companies came out in support of people with AIDS relatively early on when there was still backlash against that," said Hill. "This is a continuation of that corporate social responsibility, but it's a new, unexplored avenue." How the Work Pays Off While companies embark upon this new avenue, organizations such as the ACLU are prospering more than ever. "Historically, the ACLU doesn't get much support from companies. We're often viewed as a thorn in the government's side because we challenge them on issues," Mark Wier, chief development officer at the ACLU, told NBC News. "But we are seeing some companies create formalized gifts, and hundreds of thousands of small businesses have offered to share proceeds of sales." From last Friday, when Trump issued the immigration ban, to the following Monday, Wier says that the ACLU raised a record $35 million. Related: Celebs and VIPs Donate to ACLU to Fight Trump "We've never seen that kind of outpouring so quickly," said Wier, adding that the ACLU will use the funding to hire over 100 employees including litigators, advocates, and communications specialists. "We need to power up the grid up we've already established with more force," said Wier. "Since the ACLU was able to get a stay on that executive order in federal district court, people are really seeing that it is possible to do something — and to actually win."

Karnataka’s IT minister said Apple had agreed to assemble its hugely popular phones in the southern state, whose capital Bangalore is India’s technology hub. Apple, which has not commented on the minister’s statement, remains a relatively small player in India, where sales of its smartphones lag those of rival Samsung. But chief executive Tim Cook said this week it would “invest significantly” in the country of 1.25 billion people. “We have an understanding with Apple and we expect them to start manufacturing in Karnataka by the end of April,” state minister of information technology and biotechnology Priyank Kharge told AFP. He said the new operation would likely assemble iPhones for the domestic market. Apple has only a two per cent share of the Indian market, well behind rival Samsung on 23 per cent, according to research firm Canalys. By pricing itself exclusively at the luxury end, Apple has distinguished its brand from Samsung which has both low-cost and high-end phones. Last year Apple had 48 per cent of the premium sector in which phones sell for US$450 and above. It applied to open Apple Stores in India last year, but was reportedly rebuffed because of a diktat that states foreign retailers must source 30 per cent of their products locally. New Delhi has since relaxed the rules, giving companies up to eight years to meet the sourcing requirements, as part of a push to attract foreign investment and create jobs. It is not clear whether the Karnataka plans would help it clear that hurdle but experts said manufacturing locally would reduce the company’s costs and enable it to lower prices. “They’re eager to be here because they’ve identified India as a strategic focus market,” said Jaideep Mehta of research firm IDC. “They had a fantastic 2016 in India and shipped more two million devices to India, and now they’re looking to ultimately manufacture here as that gives them more flexibility to respond to market changes.” Apple currently sells through third-party retailers in India, which accounts for only around one per cent of global iPhone sales. Experts say India’s giant population and low number of smartphone owners relative to its size mean it is a huge potential market. Last year Cook visited India on a charm offensive and was pictured using Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s gold iPhone to launch the premier’s new app. Analysts said that if confirmed the move would be a coup for India’s government, which has been trying to persuade foreign companies to manufacture in the country. Reports in Indian media said Wistron Corp, a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer, was lined up to assemble iPhones at a plant on the outskirts of tech hub Bangalore. Apple outsources all its manufacturing globally. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Algorithms: the managers of our digital lives Google brings virtual reality to updated Chrome mobile browser Sony's new 4K Ultra HD TVs, Blu-ray player hit stores in March Facebook to provide ad data for independent audit Apple TV eyes Amazon Fire TV's success ‘Final Fantasy XV’ blends free and paid add-ons with update announcement (VIDEO) Apple to start building iPhones in India Top 2017 smartphones and new Nokia handsets expected at Mobile World Congress Singing robot and 18th Century Silver Swan star in new London exhibition (VIDEO) Watch out Batman, this bladeless bat-like drone might be faster than you (VIDEO) Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Indian government wants Apple, but not all officials are biting India to consider Apple request for investment incentives with ‘open mind’ Apple can sell iPhone 7s in Indonesia after R&D investment commitment China users complain of combustible iPhones, report claims Five takeaways from Apple media event (VIDEO) Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

By Karissa Bell2017-02-03 21:22:53 UTC The App Store could be just months away from a major shakeup that would render thousands of apps obsolete, including many of the iPhone's earliest success stories. After more than a year of encouraging developers to update tens of thousands of apps that were never adjusted to support the 64-bit processors that debuted with the iPhone 5S, Apple appears poised to begin forcing developers' hands. SEE ALSO: Apps aren't dead — they're thriving to the tune of $89 billion While previous versions of iOS have included tamer warnings upon launching apps built on older architecture, the latest version of the iOS 10 beta contains a new one: "this app will not work with future versions of iOS."

RIP 32-bit emulation mode in iOS 11? pic.twitter.com/byMFuJPuVN — Peter Steinberger (@steipete) January 31, 2017 Put simply, rather than merely shaming developers with outdated apps, it looks like Apple will effectively brick these apps once iOS 11 rolls out.  It looks like Apple will effectively brick these apps once iOS 11 rolls out. While it's difficult to say for sure how many of the App Store's apps haven't been updated to support 64-bit processors, the data we have suggests tens of thousands of apps could be affected.  Though Apple began supporting 64-bit code with the iPhone 5S in 2013, the company didn't begin requiring developers to support the code in new apps and updates until 2015. This means there's a good chance that any app that hasn't been updated in two or more years is still running on 32-bit code.  That might sound like a long time to go without an update, but there are a huge number of apps that fall into this category. Twenty-eight percent of apps in the App Store have not been updated in at least two years, according to a report last fall from app analytics company Sensor Tower. (Apple removed more than 47,000 of these soon after, according to the firm.) Image: Sensor Tower Now, this issue of "app rot" is a very real problem. Having thousands of old, crappy apps cluttering the App Store adds little value. Still, the change could kill a number of classic apps that first helped make the iPhone a success. The change could kill a number of classic apps that first helped make the iPhone a success. Apps like Ocarina and Great Lightsaber, among the greatest iPhone apps of all time, would be on the chopping block. Games, particularly those from indie developers, could be especially hard hit by the move. Ridiculous Fishing, Hundreds and Peggle Classic helped put iPhone gaming on the map and still have loyal followings, even if they haven't received significant updates in years. But these developers, most of whom have long since moved on to other projects, are now faced with a difficult decision: put the needed time and effort into updating these apps or disappoint longtime fans who will have to choose between keeping iOS up to date or playing the games. For many, it's not a simple choice. Making the necessary changes to a single game may take only a few days, but the time quickly adds up if you have multiple apps that need attention, notes Adam Saltsman, cofounder of Finji, the studio behind indie hits like Canabalt, Hundreds and Aquaria.  "It's  a non-trivial amount of maintenance cost not to add any new features, just keep the thing available," Saltsman says. "We're going to have to just do the math on it," he says of his own games, like Hundreds. "At some point, we have to weigh not just are we executing on what we feel is a reasonable creative or generous responsibility to the players who have supported us in the past, but can we justify taking a bunch of time away from our current projects. It's a little bit of a zero sum thing." Sure, developers who still make significant revenue from older apps may be more likely to make the change ahead of the launch of iOS 11. But, for many more, Apple's ultimatum will almost certainly be a death sentence.  BONUS: Everything we think we know about the next iPhone Topics: app store (iOS) , Apple, apps-and-software, Apps and Software, iOS apps, Tech About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Woe betide the woman who strays Rachel Cooke For a so-called celebration of female sexuality, the BBC’s Apple Tree Yard leaves much to be desired ‘Slightly loopy plot’: Ben Chaplin and Emily Watson in Apple Tree Yard. Photograph: BBC/Kudos/Nick Briggs Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Contact author @msrachelcooke Saturday 4 February 2017 19.05 EST Last modified on Monday 6 February 2017 08.57 EST When the BBC series Apple Tree Yard began last month, I was a little dismissive. It seemed a bit silly to me, this affair between a supposedly high-flying scientist and a man she barely knew. Though lust can make fools of us all, surely there are limits. The lonely widow whose internet lover relieves her of her life savings is one thing. Quite another is the leading geneticist who has sex in a House of Commons broom cupboard with a bloke she will shortly decide is a spook on the sole grounds that he has a working understanding of security cameras. When this man of mystery later demanded, in a Westminster bar, that she hand over her knickers pronto, I laughed. Though not, admittedly, as loudly as I did when she went to the loo and obediently whipped them off. Still, I stuck with it, returning for episode two and then, in a rush for the finish line, consuming the final pair of episodes via a press preview site. “The thriller,” wrote Raymond Chandler, “is an extension of the fairytale. It is melodrama so embellished as to create the illusion that the story being told, however unlikely, could be true.” I didn’t feel that Apple Tree Yard could be true. I still don’t. Its flaws of psychology and slightly loopy plot seem to me mostly to negate its emotional authenticities. Nevertheless, it tugged at me. Partly, it was that I wanted to know what was going to happen. It is brilliantly suspenseful. But I also needed to work out why, with every episode that I watched, it made me more uneasy. The last time I experienced a similar sense of compulsive disquiet, it was 1987 and I was watching Fatal Attraction, another thriller in which an extramarital sexual relationship has, to put it mildly, grave repercussions for those involved. Before it began, Apple Tree Yard was sold to us quite emphatically as being on the side of women, and middle-aged women to boot, that species so often absent from our screens. It is based on a novel by a woman, Louise Doughty, its screenwriter, Amanda Coe, is a woman, and so, too, is its director, Jessica Hobbs. Its star, Emily Watson (who plays Yvonne Carmichael), spoke in interviews of how pleased she was to have landed such a strong role; the Radio Times described it excitedly as a drama that “celebrates female sexuality”. How bewildering, then, to find that, in reality, Carmichael’s unbridled fun with Mark Costley (a giveaway of a name that might have come straight from Dickens) lasted for all of 50 minutes, after which the party abruptly ended when she was savagely raped by a colleague. Was this her punishment? I pushed the thought from my mind. Don’t over-react, I thought. But then came episode two. Retribution now seemed to be around every corner, every kitchen counter. Her rapist was stalking her. Her husband was having an affair. Her adult son seemed to be suffering a reoccurrence of his mental illness. And she could not – or would not – report the rape, mostly because she feared the discovery of her relationship with Costley. Carmichael was portrayed as numb, barely able to function. But she was not so numb that she didn’t agree to meet Costley at a “safe house” (for which read: an empty flat) where, after they’d had sex, she asked him to warn off her stalker. Her affair and her rape were now bound intimately together twice over. To be clear, one is not the cause of the other. But the affair is why she has kept the attack secret, and by asking Costley to frighten its perpetrator, it marks the beginning of what we know will be, for her, yet more toppling calamity (we’ve already flashed forward and seen her in a prison van). On Friday, a Daily Mail columnist who has also seen all four episodes praised Apple Tree Yard for its refusal “to pander to the popular modern fairytale that women can have endless sexual freedom without fear of repercussions”. On reading this, all my anxiety rose to the surface. (In her shoes, however, I might just have gone for broke and written “any” sexual freedom: after all, it is not suggested that Carmichael has had other affairs, and she has been with Gary, her husband, since university.) He is a presence, while she is only – or only feels herself to be – an absence Though I don’t really know what “feminist-approved tropes” might be, I am struck by the series’ imagery. It is all darkness versus light. The gloom of the St James’s alley (the eponymous Apple Tree Yard) where Carmichael and her lover have sex is set against the sacred glow of her hearth and home; the pewter Thames that she and Costley sit beside in their lunch hour is in marked contrast to the bright glint of the glass in which her husband will later pour her wine. Her adult daughter is happily pregnant. Her husband is, by her own account, “a good man” and depicted as long suffering (in spite of his affair). Her house is spacious and comes with all those 21st-century ramparts that safely put distance between the middle classes and the world outside. Her universe is, in other words, replete with all the old certainties. Why, the question is implicitly asked, did she want to risk it by having in an affair? And here’s the rub. Why did she? In the end, what bothers me most about Apple Tree Yard is not its seemingly punitive atmosphere so much as Carmichael’s motivation, her delusion in the matter of Costley. This is difficult to write about because I wouldn’t want to spoil the ending for you (when it comes, it is exciting, unexpected). But right from the beginning, her obscure desire for him has seemed to me to be built on little more than her lack of self-esteem. He is a presence, while she is only – or only feels herself to be – an absence. “You saw me,” she whispers in voiceover, more than once. If Apple Tree Yard is really saying that a woman’s faith in herself, even a clever, able, successful woman, is sometimes a faltering, unsteady thing, well, they’re hardly wrong. But I do think its makers might have found a slightly more subtle way to depict the harm this might cause her. The havoc here is biblical, a tumult of thunderbolts that strike as if from nowhere.

Advertisement Last year, Apple released an iOS 10.2.1 beta for developers and those signed up via the free Beta Software Program. The iOS 10.2.1 beta helped Apple squash a number of issues ahead of the official release. The final iOS 10.2.1 release is here. And while the update fixes some lingering iOS 10 issues, it looks like the iOS 10.2.1 update’s brought its own problems to iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users around the world. iPhone and iPad users are reporting iOS 10.2.1 problems including abnormal battery drain. With iOS 10.2.1 problems starting to emerge we want to take a look at the most important things iPhone, iPad and iPod touch owners need to know as we push away from the iOS 10.2.1 release date. This roundup looks at the current state of iOS 10.2.1 problems, offers potential fixes for the most common iOS 10.2.1 issues, and it provides some resources that could come in handy if you start to see trouble with your version of the iOS 10.2 update. Advertisement It also takes a look at what’s next from Apple in terms of bug fixes for iOS 10 problems. iOS 10.2.1 Problems It’s early but we’re already starting to hear about some of the iOS 10.2.1 problems affecting those who recently downloaded Apple’s update. We’re seeing complaints about abnormal battery drain, broken Wi-Fi, missing News app, finicky Bluetooth, busted cellular data, issues with lag, crashes, random reboots, email issues, installation problems, various issues with sound, and more. iPhone users are also complaining about a “30% battery bug.” Those experiencing the issue say their battery suddenly dies when their device reaches the 30% battery mark. Advertisement The issue first appeared late last year and it appears to be fairly widespread. It’s not unclear when Apple plans to address the issue. The company hasn’t publicly acknowledged the problem and the issue remains unresolved in iOS 10.2.1 Apple’s discussion forums, Reddit, and social media sites like Twitter are starting to fill up with complaints about iOS 10.2.1 and we expect more complaints to emerge as more people download and use the iOS 10.2.1 update on their device. Hey @Apple, What about battery life? 😒 yeah talking about iOS 10.2.1 update! #iOS10 #Update — iJoker (@MeiDoctor) January 23, 2017 @GordonKelly same build as the final beta so it's the same version we got of beta last week. So bug still present. 😫 — Daitron Winston Sr. (@IssaTrapBrah) January 23, 2017 Anyone else’s battery sucking wind after iOS 10.2.1 update? — ⓢⓒⓞⓣⓣ (@scottaw) January 24, 2017 My battery life on iOS 10.2.1 is absolutely terrible. Is it just me? — Mike (@MikeCam) January 24, 2017 Welp, iOS 10.2.1 is still yet to fix iOS's persistent refusal to use wifi networks that have a "captive portal." — Xenoveritas (@xenoveritas) January 25, 2017 iOS 10.2.1 does nothing to fix how terrible iOS 10 is with Bluetooth. Too bad. #iOS10 #iOS — Donovan Bond (@DonovanBond) January 27, 2017 might wanna avoid the iOS 10.2.1 update unless you want 30% battery drain issue, Wi-Fi & Bluetooth problems, UI lag, and more.. @PaulSpain — Craig Harris (@elusivetones) January 26, 2017 @apple come on!!! iOS 10.2.1 and Bluetooth is still broken 😤 — Rune Christiansen (@RuneKC_DK) January 26, 2017 @AppleSupport updated to ios 10.2.1 and now none of my bluetooth devices pair (except my watch). 😟 — Brad Campbell (@geekmuse) January 24, 2017 It’s impossible to predict what you might run into after you install iOS 10.2.1 on your phone or tablet. This is why we recommend doing some prep work before you download the new update. A little preparation could go a long way toward preventing iOS 10.2.1 problems on your device. At the very least, you’ll want to make a backup, just in case you do run into one of these (or another) iOS 10.2.1 issues. Where to Find Feedback As we push into the new year it’s important to keep tabs on the iOS 10.2.1 update and its performance. Digging into iOS 10.2.1 feedback will alert you to potential problems and it’ll help you find potential benefits of the iOS 10.2.1 update. Fortunately, you’ll find a ton of iOS 10.2.1 feedback to sift through. You just need to know where to look. To start, we’ve put together some reasons to and not to install the iOS 10.2.1 update right now. If you’re on the fence about the iOS 10.2.1 update, you’ll want to start there. We’ve been digging into iOS 10.2.1’s performance on several popular devices including the iPhone 7, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6, iPhone 5, and iPad. We’ll continue to provide feedback about each of these updates as we push further away from the iOS 10.2.1 release date. We also recommend keeping an eye on YouTube, Apple’s discussion forums, social media sites like Twitter/Facebook, and the MacRumors forums for additional feedback about Apple’s iOS 10.2.1 updates for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. How to Fix iOS 10.2.1 Problems If you run into trouble with your iOS 10.2.1 update you probably don’t need to make an appointment to see an Apple Genius. At least not yet. There’s a good chance you’ll be able to fix the problem on your own at home (or the office). If you start noticing issues take a look at our lengthy list of fixes for the most common iOS 10 problems on iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. Our list includes potential fixes for abnormal battery drain, Wi-Fi issues, Bluetooth problems, UI lag, and more. There are tons of potential fixes for iOS 10.2.1 problems. If we’re unable to provide you with a remedy for your iOS 10.2.1 problem, you should go to Apple’s discussion forums for help with issues on iPhone, iPad, Apple Music, and more. Users over there are generally very helpful. If Apple’s official forums can’t help you solve your problem, you can get in contact with Apple Support via Twitter or schedule an appointment to see a Genius at a local Apple Store. iOS 10.2 Downgrade Closed Downgrading to an older version of iOS can sometimes help improve performance. Unfortunately, the downgrade is now closed. Apple’s no longer signing off on iOS 10.2 which means you can no longer drop down to it in an effort to improve your device’s performance. If you’re on iOS 10.2.1 you’re stuck until Apple releases the next iOS 10 update. That could be days from now, it could be weeks, we simply don’t know. For more on the downgrade process, take a look at our walkthrough. It’ll help you get prepared for next time. What’s Next Apple’s confirmed an iOS 10.3 update but it’s unclear if its next in line for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch owners. The iOS 10.3 update is confirmed and the first beta delivers several new features and tweaks. It also brings some bug fixes and performance improvements. If you’re dealing with an issue on iOS 10.2.1 or below, we highly recommend monitoring the iOS 10.3 update as it passes through beta. We should see several more beta updates emerge before the update is officially released for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. Unfortunately, we don’t know when Apple will roll out its next big iOS 10 update and its collection of tweaks and fixes. The company hasn’t confirmed a specific release date though we, and others, expect it to arrive in the early part of 2017. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.2.1 & 6 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.2.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 10 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.2.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  The iOS 10.2 update brings 13 known patches for potential exploits. That's one more than its predecessor (iOS 10.2). These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2 update and/or the iOS 10.1.1 update, know that iOS 10.2.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2 update had 12 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.2.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.2.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 10 12 Responses 12/13/2016 Betsy Greenaker Reply Hi, on my husband’s 7 plus “hey Siri” doesn’t work at all.

It is 3 bars within 1m of my router, however 2-3m away it drops down to 1 bar & any further away drops completely! All my other devices work perfectly with the router. I am tech savvy & safe to say non of the fixes out lined anywhere on the i-net work. I am left with an Iphone with no access to I-net.

Need it now… 02/09/2017 Chetan Reply I have the same problem and was hoping that 10.3 would resolve it, but even after 2 beta version of 10.3, the problem persists… the worst part, if you go to 10.3 beta, you cannot downgrade to 10.2 as the filesystem has changed… really frustrating… 02/08/2017 Jim Reply I have gone through literally hundreds of apple product updates since 1987 on 25 Mac and IOS devices. I can still safely say we are still not approaching the 450 documented bugs with one Microsoft Word update of the early 90s. What worries me though is how close we are getting. We laugh no more at their plight. And no i wont upgrade til they fix it. 02/08/2017 Mahmood Alavi Reply After updating to iOS 10.2.1, at times if someone calls me, I don’t receive the call & caller gets a ‘busy’ tone.

The move has been long in the making, but an official statement from the government of Karnataka has now sealed the deal. To quote local IT minister Priyank Kharge: Apples iPhones will be made in Bangalore and all devices will be targeted at the domestic market Cupertino is yet to officialize things, or give any time frame for production kick-off, but excitement is already in the air. iPhones will be assembled in a plant in the outskirts of Bangalore by Wistron Corp. This falls in line with Apple's traditional outsourcing approach and this time the lucrative contract will land in the hands of Taiwanese manufacturer Wistron. Apple is apparently foregoing some of its more traditional partners for this deal, namely Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., also know as Foxconn. Still, others might be drafted later, as production expands. This might be somehow related to India's legal requirement that single-brand retailers in the country need to source at least 30 percent of their parts locally. And besides the manufacturing effort, it does appear Apple's long-term intention is to expand on the local market, more than anything else. As part of the ongoing negotiations, the US giant has also sought approval for running its own network of stores and retailers across the country. In the longer term, its a great move  We are in discussions on a number of things, including retail stores, and fully intend to invest significantly in the country. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has made it abundantly clear that India "is the place to be". An over-saturated Chinese market, along with overflowing production make a strong case for such a statement. Still, expanding in developing markets is incredibly tough, especially in value-conscious India. In 2016, iPhone shipments into the country only add up to 2.5 million units- just enough to earn Apple the honorable tenth spot in the most sold brand list, losing badly to budget offers by the likes of Samsung. Still, the US titan has high hopes for an ever-increasing living standard in India and thus a wider market for its premium devices. Apple's entry into the local production scene might just kick the process into high gear, as India will essentially only be the third country to ever take on iPhone production. Plus, changes to the company's vast supplier chain of around 766 companies is imminent as well, with many new partnerships likely to come from within the country and cover that 30% parts and materials sourcing quota. That all adds up to new jobs and opportunities for the local workforce. Cupertino has also, allegedly, managed to negotiate some great starting conditions with the local government, including a 15-year tax holiday for importing components and equipment. Still, all things considered, it is a win-win situation for both parties, since the expansion does tie in great with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "Made in India" initiative.

The fruit, sold sliced and marketed under the brand Arctic Apple, could hit a cluster of Midwestern grocery stores as early as Feb. 1. The limited release is an early test run for the controversial apple, which has been genetically modified to eliminate the browning that occurs when an apple is left out in the open air. Critics and advocates of genetic engineering say the apple could be a turning point in the nation’s highly polarizing debate over genetically modified organisms (GMOs). While genetic modifications have in the past been mainly defended as a way to protect crops, the Artic Apple would be one of the first GMOs marketed directly to consumers as more convenient. “What companies are desperate for is some really popular GMO product to hit the market,” said McKay Jenkins, the author of a forthcoming history of the debate. “Any successful product could lift the cloud over GMOs.” Industry executives predict the apple could open a whole new trade in genetically engineered produce, potentially opening the market to pink pineapples, antioxidant-enriched tomatoes and other foods in development. “We see this as less about genetic modification and more about convenience,” said Neal Carter, founder of the company that makes the Arctic Apple. “I think consumers are very ready for apples that don’t go brown. Everyone can identify with that ‘yuck’ factor.” GMO critics say they are hopeful, however, that consumers will continue to show skepticism about the produce. Despite a growing consensus in scientific circles that GMOs pose little risk, environmental and consumer groups have successfully mounted campaigns against GMOs over the past 30 years, successfully limiting the practice to commodity crops such as soybeans and corn. Anti-GMO groups have successfully pushed for GMO crop bans in places like Boulder, Colorado, and Sonoma, California, and several major food brands have agreed not to use genetically modified ingredients. Critics have also questioned how consumers will be able to judge the freshness of sliced apples when they don’t brown. “This apple is understudied, unlabeled, and unnecessary,” said Dana Perls, the senior food and technology campaigner with the environmental nonprofit Friends of the Earth. “It’s only a matter of time before consumers realize they’re being falsely marketed to … And then there will be an uproar.” Carter and his company, Okanagan Specialty Fruits, have bet millions of dollars that this will not be the case. The Canadian fruit-grower, now a fully owned subsidiary of the biotechnology firm Intrexon, has spent the past 20 years developing the Arctic Apple under the direction of Neal and his wife, Louisa. Neal, a bio-resource engineer and longtime apple- and cherry-grower in British Columbia, planted his first crop of non-browning Golden Delicious and Granny Smith apples in 2003. After nine years of testing, the Carters petitioned the U.S. Department of Agriculture to deregulate the apples, which would allow them to sell in the United States. Despite vocal opposition from anti-GMO groups — which organized petition drives and sent public comments by the tens of thousands — the agency ruled in February 2015 that the apple posed no significant health or environmental risks. For the Arctic Apple, however, the greatest test is yet to come: whether the convenience of a non-browning apple is enough to persuade consumers to look past GMO’s negative reputation. “I don’t know what their chances are — it’s a very polarized debate,” said Michael White, an assistant professor of genetics at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. “But I think this is huge. What the Arctic Apple is doing, trying to push GMOs on their own merits, could lead to a more positive discussion.” Despite widespread scientific consensus that genetic engineering is not dangerous to human health, the practice remains controversial and poorly understood. Both the World Health Organization and the National Academy of Science have concluded that there are no health reasons for avoiding the current slate of genetically engineered foods. But in a 2016 poll conducted by the Pew Research Center, 39 percent of Americans said that they believed genetically modified foods were worse for their health than other foods. And the Non-GMO Project, a nonprofit that opposes genetic engineering and administers the Non-GMO label seen on some North American foods, points out that 92 percent of American consumers believe that genetically modified products should be labeled, according to Consumer Reports. Most Americans already consume a large number of GMOs or GMO-derived ingredients every day. Ninety percent of all corn and soybeans grown in the United States are engineered to improve agricultural efficiency and withstand frequent pesticide applications. The resulting corn and soy are frequently fed to animals intended for human consumption, or routed into such processed foods as cornstarch, corn meal, corn syrup, soybean oil, soy lethicin and dozens of other derivatives. Yet even if consumers already eat GMOs, very few do so knowingly. To date, most agricultural engineering has focused almost exclusively on improving yields for producers. The exceptions are the Flavr Savr tomato — the world’s first commercialized GMO, which suffered lackluster sales and was eventually pulled following its introduction in 1994 — and the more recent non-browning Innate Potato, currently sold at Walmart and several other stores under the White Russet brand. But the Arctic Apple has a distinct advantage over its predecessors: It’s being sold sliced in 10-ounce bags as a convenience snack food. The Carters say they’re imitating the baby carrot model, which has proven a success for vegetable growers, helping to catapult sales of the vegetable. Pre-sliced apples, currently treated with chemicals to prevent browning, enjoy a similar popularity in school cafeterias and Happy Meals. “We might eventually sell them to distributors for service in schools,” Carter said. “We thought our initial go-to-market strategy would be through food service. But a significant number of retailers reached out, and we realized — they’re ready for us.” Just in case they’re not, of course, Okanagan has hired a marketing consultant and a consumer research firm, convening apple-tasting focus groups and commissioning surveys. Okanagan, which had six full-time employees 14 months ago, plans to quadruple that workforce in the next two years. The February trial-run is part of that public relations campaign; Okanagan wants to “validate our messaging and go-to-market strategy” before launching commercially in the fall, Carter said. The apples will be available at 10 locations of “a few” regional Midwestern grocery chains, which Carter declined to name, where employees will be on hand to poll customers about their first impressions. Crucially, the apples’ packaging will not explicitly declare that they’re genetically engineered - to get that information, shoppers will have to scan a QR code with a smartphone. This was one of the most controversial points of the Obama administration’s GMO labeling law, which requires that genetically modified ingredients be noted with an on-package statement, approved symbol or electronic code. Okanagan has argued that, thanks to media coverage, most consumers will already know that its apples are GMOs. This non-browning technology could theoretically be applied later to any number of tree fruits, including pears and cherries, which Okanagan’s scientists have already begun to research. The success of the Arctic Apple could embolden the creators of other consumer-directed GMOs currently waiting in the wings. The Food and Drug Administration recently approved an engineered pink pineapple containing the pigment lycopene, which has been found to reduce the risk of cancer and heart disease in consumers who eat tomatoes. In Britain, researchers have developed a tomato that contains extra antioxidants. And many of the United States’ major agrochemical firms, including DuPont Pioneer and Monsanto, have indicated a desire to introduce GMOs with marketable consumer benefits, if consumers seem ready to accept them. That concerns critics of the Arctic Apple and genetic engineering. More than 130,000 people signed just one of the petitions opposing Okanagan’s initial deregulation petition, citing concerns over yet-unknown “negative unintended impacts on human health and the environment.” Among the loudest critics of the apple are Friends of the Earth and Food & Water Watch, both environmental groups, and the Organic Consumers Association, Consumers Union and Center for Food Safety, all of which represent customers. CFS has particularly faulted Okanagan for not running more tests on the impact of genetic change to the apple tree, as opposed to just the fruit. “It’s an unnecessary genetic change intended to grow market share,” said Martha Crouch, a plant biologist and consulting scientist for CFS. “It carries with it environmental and health risks. That puts a larger burden of proof on the company that makes it.”       Related Articles Weekly roll call report: Dental health services in tribal settings Contractor tabbed for Saddle Rock project Semi truck removed from river Commercial curbside recycling suspended in Manson New hospital enthusiasts to gather PUD ends 2016 with budget boost from Alcoa Advertisements   SOCIAL Facebook Twitter Pinterest Instagram APPS Apple iOS Google Play SERVICES Subscribe Make a Payment Digital Edition E-mail Newsletters Newspaper in Education Special Publications Commercial Print Advertise With Us CALENDAR NCW Calendar Add an Event CONTACT US Paper Delivery Issue World of Savings Anniversaries Engagements Weddings Vacation Stop Letter to the Editor Staff Directory Contact Us MULTIMEDIA Videos Photos Photo Galleries Webcams CLASSIFIEDS Homes Jobs Business Classifieds PARTNERS The Art of Community NCW Foothills Magazine Lake Chelan This Week Medical, Health & Wellness Directory Quincy Valley Post-Register The Washington Post National Weekly Wenatchee Mom Blog Wenatchee Valley Business World © The Wenatchee World 2017 Terms of Use Forum Standards Privacy Policy

Android and iOS both have smart photo services built in nowadays, but what happens when you want to jump from one to the other? Here's what you need to know. In this guide we'll be tackling the challenge of moving your whole photo library from one service to the other: this is a full traded-in-my-iPhone-for-a-Pixel scenario, a clean break where you're switching from Apple Photos to Google Photos or back the other way. Image: Google For a lot of people it might be better to have a foot in both camps, at least for some photos or for some of the time, but for simplicity's sake we won't go into every possible scenario here. You can in fact use these services alongside each other pretty easily, but in this case we'll tackle going from one to the other wholesale. It's also worth noting these are not exactly directly comparable services, with Apple's photo offerings very much baked into its hardware and software, and Google Photos very much web-first and operating independently of your computers, phones and tablets. Switching from Apple Photos to Google Photos Before you jump to Google Photos you need to decide if you want to store your photos (and videos) at their original resolution or whether you're happy to put up with some resizing — images are stored at a maximum of 16 megapixels and videos are stored at a maximum of 1080p HD. If you choose the second option, you can store as much as you want, for free. If you want to keep everything as it is, you need to think about paying for Google Drive storage, as you only get 15GB for free. Prices start at 100GB for $US1.99 ($3) a month. Once you've decided, you need to work out where your photos are, and given the different apps on macOS and iOS, and the recent upgrades to both, you could be forgiven for not being too sure. Thankfully, Google Photos isn't too fussed. Download the Google Photos desktop client for macOS and mobile app for iOS and both will get to work picking up all the pictures from your computers and iDevices. The desktop app asks which photo libraries you want to back up when you start it, and the iOS app simply backs up everything it can find. The only images and videos that might get missed are those you've uploaded to iCloud and deleted from your devices, if you're using iCloud. To get these files back on macOS, launch Photos, then open the Photos menu, choose Preferences, switch to iCloud and make sure Download Originals to Mac is selected. On iOS, if you have the space, open Settings then tap iCloud, Photos and Download and Keep Originals. If for whatever reason you can't get your iCloud photos back to a Mac or iOS device, the export options from iCloud on the web are a little less than stellar. Pictures can be downloaded individually easily enough, but for bulk downloads you have to use the Shift or Cmd keys to select multiple items at once, then click the download icon. Once saved somewhere, they can be uploaded to Google Photos using a desktop client or just your web browser. Switching from Google Photos to Apple Photos As we've said, Google Photos lives on the web, but getting all your pictures and videos back down again isn't too difficult — though it might take some time if you've got a massive photo library and a sluggish internet connection. With Apple Photos, you don't have to store your pictures in the cloud, but if you do then you'll probably need to pay for extra storage. The Google Photos desktop client for macOS doesn't have two-way sync, but the one for Google Drive does. First, go to Google Drive on the web, open the Settings page (via the cog icon) and tick the box marked Automatically put your Google Photos into a folder in My Drive under the General tab. That doesn't change anything about what's stored in Google Photos, it just makes everything visible in Google Drive. Then, download and install the macOS client for Google Drive, and make sure the Google Photos folder is selected in the list of folders to sync, which will be displayed during the setup process. Hey presto, all your photos and videos are pulled down from the cloud. In the Photos app on your Mac, pick File then Import to load in the newly downloaded content. It's only if you don't have a Mac computer to hand that difficulties arise — if you're using Apple's photo services solely on iPhones, iPads, and the web, maybe. If you have a Windows machine to hand, you can use the same trick as above to get the images and videos downloaded. Then, instead of running the Photos app on macOS, use iTunes and your iDevice, or just iCloud on the web, to get everything up to the iCloud Photo Library. Alternatively you can use the Google Takeout service to download all of your pictures and video from Google Photos if you don't want to go down the Google Drive syncing route. All of your stuff gets served up as a compressed folder which you can then extract and move to Apple's apps on the desktop, on mobile and in the cloud. A computer of some kind really is essential though as a stopgap between Google Photos and Apple's Photos apps, even if you're planning to use nothing but an iPhone and iCloud Photo Library for the rest of your life. In other words you can't go straight from cloud service to cloud service. Without investing too much time and effort you should be up and running on your new photo management system and ready to take and store pictures again — at least until you decide to switch to something new.

Mobile by Jason Cipriani February 1, 2017 9:17 AM PST @MrCippy Apple on Wednesday released the first firmware update for its wireless AirPods. The update bumps the firmware from 3.3.1 to 3.5.1, but without a change log it's hard to know what Apple fixed, changed or added. The update was first spotted by a Reddit user. If you've had your AirPods connected to your iPhone in the past 24 hours, odds are the update is already installed without you having to do a thing. Enlarge Image Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET Check the firmware version of your AirPods by opening the Settings app, then going to > General > About > AirPods. Note: AirPods will only display in About when connected to your iPhone. If the firmware version isn't 3.5.1, place both AirPods in the charging case and leave it connected to your iPhone. The update will install automatically in the background. Wait a bit, then re-check the firmware version in About, and it should reflect the latest firmware version. Today's update comes a week after Apple released iOS 10.3 in beta, which included a Find My AirPods feature.

Don't tell me! Deborah Ross remains gripped by Apple Tree Yard as it takes a very unexpected turn  By Deborah Ross for Event magazine Published: 17:01 EST, 4 February 2017 | Updated: 17:01 EST, 4 February 2017 e-mail 9 shares View comments Apple Tree Yard                                                                                         Sunday, BBC1 Rating: Oh, Apple Tree Yard, you have me in your grip and make no mistake. I would not wish to be in your grip. I am suffering, being in your grip.  I have been minded to buy the book (by Louise Doughty) so that I can be released from the misery of not knowing what will happen – I can’t tell you how many times my finger has hovered over Amazon – but no, I told myself, I must see it out, even though, the smack on the car door? Who was that? What if I buy the book and just, you know, have a tiny look? A peek? You work absolutely as a thriller, Apple Tree Yard (Who exactly is ‘Mr X’?). That’s what I’m saying here. But now you’ve even improved on that.  Apple Tree Yard sold itself as something of a midlife- crisis romp, and that’s what we thought it would be. But at the end of the first episode, Yvonne was shockingly raped You drew viewers in by saying you were one thing and then, quite unexpectedly, you suddenly became something else altogether. You sent in a plot arc that threw us all, and this does not happen very often with TV dramas.  I don’t recall it ever happening in Call The Midwife, for example, and as for The Halcyon, I don’t know, as I’ve rather lost track of it. Tell me, is it still ‘the Jazz Age’? And is everyone still harbouring secrets we don’t care about? Apple Tree Yard, you sold yourself as something a little bit steamy and a little bit racy for Sunday nights. You sold yourself as a midlife- crisis romp, and that’s what we thought you would be.  Look, middle-aged people doing it in a broom cupboard, ha ha! When they should be at home, flicking through the Cotton Traders catalogue, ha ha! But we can put all that behind us now. Your story concerns Yvonne, a respected fiftysomething scientist (played stunningly by Emily Watson) who meets handsome stranger (Ben Chaplin, but this is Watson’s gig) in the Houses of Parliament and before you know it they’re at it in that broom cupboard, sending the mop one way and the pail the other.  Then it’s alleyways and public toilets, and Yvonne wants to put a stop to it, as an otherwise sensible married mother of two, but her desire is such that she can’t.  Will her husband find out? Will her life unravel in that way? Will she come undone like Madame Bovary? That’s where we thought you were heading, Apple Tree Yard. We assumed you would be about the impact of infidelity, Dr Foster-style.  But at the end of your first episode, Yvonne was shockingly raped. By George, a rather timid-seeming colleague who hadn’t much figured until then but had seen her texting her lover at a party and, we must suppose, considered her ‘fair game’. Who saw that coming? But then, who ever does? I am not a fan of sexual violence against women as a TV trope, as I’ve said many times. But you did not dish up the rape scene as entertainment.  Instead, you used it to provide real insight into the horrors that women must endure when this happens to them, as it does.  Your second episode (of four) dealt with physical fallout – Yvonne examining the bruising on the insides of her thighs – and the psychological repercussions. Some have said, Apple Tree Yard, that it was all tooooooo sloooooooow, and it’s true, not much actually happened until right at the end, and that smack on the car door, but that was kind of the point, and anyone who didn’t get that should probably stick to Call The Midwife. Or The Halcyon. (Tell me, are they still all trading Meaningful Looks?) You offered us important TV. You showed us Yvonne’s shame and guilt, even though she was in no way to blame.  You showed us Yvonne lingering in her car outside a police station. We longed for Yvonne to report George but she drove away.  Fear makes animals of us all, your script keeps telling us, over and over (somewhat repetitively, I have to say), but fear also makes many women walk away from reporting instances such as this. We know that her affair with ‘Mr X’ – shouldn’t she know his name by now? – did not make her ‘fair game’ or ‘up for it’, but would a court? Wouldn’t any prosecution team make the most of that?  We saw that fear, as well as the fear she wouldn’t be believed, the fear her reputation would be damaged, the fear she would always be seen as a victim, the fear as to how it might impact on her family, especially her son, who is bipolar. You took your time articulating all this, it’s true, but it needed time. And now Yvonne trusts no one except ‘Mr X’, who has been recruited to do something to George but we don’t know what.  ‘Mr X’ disappeared into George’s house while Yvonne waited in the car, and waited and waited, and then bang! The smack on the car door. Who’s done what to whom? I will not download the book. I will not download the book. I. Will. Not. Download. The. Book.

According to report from The New York Post, however, that will soon change. The report claims that Prince’s Warner Music Group albums will come to Apple Music on February 12th. Currently, Prince’s music is only available on Tidal, but with the broader rollout in two weeks, the music will come to Apple Music, Spotify, Pandora, Google Play, Deezer, and others. Prince’s music was available on streaming services up until July 2015, but the artist pulled all of his work from platforms prior to his death. It’s important to note that this doesn’t mean all of Prince’s music will come to streaming services on February 12th as this deal focuses solely on his Warner Music Group albums. Rights to music from outside of that contract are still be negotiated. It was first rumored that Prince’s music could be coming to additional platforms earlier this week, when Spotify posted billboards around New York City showing its logo against a background in Prince’s iconic purple color. Following his death, Apple prominently featured a Prince collection of albums, songs, and more on iTunes. Additionally, many Apple executives commented on his passing, while Beats 1 played a multitude of tributes to the artist. It’s unclear when exactly Prince’s music will hit Apple Music, but the Grammys take place on February 12th.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Apple has snapped out of the first sales slump in the iPhone's decade-long history, but the upturn doesn't mean that the pioneering company has broken out of its innovation funk. If anything, the numbers released Tuesday in Apple's fiscal first-quarter report served as the latest reminder of the company's growing dependence on the iPhone while fruitlessly trying to come up with another breakthrough product since its chief visionary, Steve Jobs, died in 2011. ___ A rare swing and miss from Under Armour in 4Q; shares plunge BALTIMORE (AP) -- Under Armour, typically a star on earnings day, suffered a rare miss in the fourth quarter, sending shares plunging 23 percent. The company's extended streak of soaring revenue growth going back years rose 12 percent, just over half what the Baltimore company has established as its norm. ___ Stocks battle to a mixed finish as drugmakers rally NEW YORK (AP) -- US stocks finish mixed as industrial companies and banks fall, but investors bid up stocks that pay big dividends, like utilities. Health care companies rally after a meeting between President Donald Trump and drug company executives. The Dow Jones industrial average falls as recent gainers like Goldman Sachs and Boeing decline. ___ At a moment of uncertainty, Fed likely to leave rates alone WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve is all but sure to leave interest rates alone when it ends a policy meeting Wednesday at a time of steady gains for the U.S. economy but also heightened uncertainty surrounding the new Trump administration. ___ CEO Jeff Bezos says Amazon backs suit opposing Trump order SEATTLE (AP) -- Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos says the Seattle-based company supports a lawsuit filed by Washington state's attorney general against President Donald Trump and the administration over Trump's executive order on immigration and refugees. Fellow Washington state-based companies Microsoft and Expedia are also supporting the suit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle on Monday. ___ Exxon reports big drop in 4Q profit, takes gas write-down DALLAS (AP) -- Exxon Mobil posted its smallest quarterly profit in more than 17 years as low oil and gas prices pushed the company to write down the value of some natural gas holdings in the United States. The 40 percent decline in fourth-quarter profit capped Exxon's weakest year since 1998. ___ Pfizer swings to 4Q profit after rough year, hikes 2017 view Drugmaker Pfizer Inc. is forecasting slightly higher sales and profit this year after a difficult 2016, though reduced spending on overhead and lawsuits helped it swing to a fourth-quarter profit, following a loss a year earlier. The biggest U.S. drugmaker still missed analysts' profit expectations, but it edged past revenue expectations. ___ US consumer confidence slips in January from 15-year high WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. consumer confidence slipped this month after surging to a 15-year high in December. The Conference Board says its consumer confidence index dropped to 111.8 in January from a December reading of 113.3, which had been the highest since August 2001. ___ Trump to sign order strengthening cybersecurity WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Donald Trump is planning to sign an executive order to improve the government's ability to protect its computer networks and fend off hackers. The move puts the Office of Management and Budget in charge of cybersecurity efforts within the executive branch and directs federal agency heads to develop their own protection plans. Such a review has become a familiar move for an incoming administration. This year, it follows allegations of election-season hacking by the Russian government. ___ Wal-Mart dumps its version of Amazon Prime for new path NEW YORK (AP) -- Wal-Mart is replacing a program that offered free shipping but had an annual fee with one that has a lower free shipping threshold and faster delivery. It's one of the first big moves by Walmart.com's CEO Mark Lore, whose company Jet.com Wal-Mart bought last year as it hopes to answer Amazon's powerful Prime membership success. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average sank 107.04 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,864.09. The S&P 500 lost 2.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,278.87. The Nasdaq composite gained 1.07 points to 5,614.79. U.S. crude oil rose 18 cents to $52.81 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, added 47 cents to $55.70 a barrel in London. Natural gas fell 12 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $3.12 per 1,000 cubic feet. Wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.53 a gallon. Heating oil picked up 1 cent to $1.61 a gallon.

The government has spent 1.8 million euro fighting the decision which said Apple secured illegal state aid The Republic's government has already spent 1.8 million euro (£1.5 million) fighting the landmark decision which says the tech giant secured illegal state aid. Answering questions at a parliamentary inquiry into the case in Dublin, Michael Noonan said he did not think the ruling helped the fight to get multinationals to pay more tax. An investigation by the European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager last year found Apple paid 50 euro in tax for every one million of profit made outside the US in 2014. The government and Apple are both appealing the decision. At the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr Noonan said: "I don't think (the Commission) were focusing on Ireland particularly. "I don't think Apple worldwide were paying sufficient tax. The argument was that the tax liability was not in Ireland." Mr Noonan added: "I think a lot of decisions in Europe are a mix of technical data and mix of politics and I think there was a political input here." Apple got rulings from Ireland's tax inspectors in 1991 and 2007 about a complex corporate structure involving three subsidiaries - Apple Operations International (AOI), Apple Sales International (ASI) and Apple Operations Europe (AOE) - and how sales were routed through Ireland. Mr Noonan said he was surprised Commissioner Vestager estimated the tax due was 13 billion euro over 10 years. Apple boss Tim Cook rejected an invitation to attend committee hearings on the case. Mr Cook previously appeared at a congressional hearing in Washington DC, where he explained that Apple effectively paid 2% tax rate for its subsidiaries in Ireland, where the headline corporation tax rate is 12.5%. Ms Vestager told the committee during the week that her office's inquiry began in 2013 after evidence from Apple to the US Senate that it had a "tax incentive arrangement" with Ireland. Negotiations are ongoing with Apple for the 13 billion euro to be transferred into an escrow where it would be held until the appeal at the European courts runs its course. In his statement to the committee, Mr Noonan said it was untrue that Ireland treated Apple more favourably. "It is important to take this seriously as it is very damaging for our reputation to be called into question in this way," he said. "This affects how Ireland could be treated by other jurisdictions, damages Ireland's credibility in the international tax debate and inhibits Ireland in pressing arguments that serve our national interest." Mr Noonan said a central aspect of the case is that the economic activity that created the value in Apple's business operations was not conducted in Ireland. "E veryone knows that the iPhone and other well-known Apple products were developed in the US, not Ireland. "Our tax legislation, which reflects international norms, only allows us to tax non-resident companies on the profits that they make in Ireland. "As a result, the bulk of Apple's profits were not subject to Irish tax," he said. Mr Noonan also accused the commission of "attempting to re-write Irish corporation tax legislation".

Contact Author | Meet other investing specialists 78 million  Apple  reported solid first-quarter results, with the big highlight being iPhone sales, which broke an all-time record of 78.2 million units during the three months through December. Sales were boosted by increased sales of the higher-priced iPhone 7 Plus, and services revenue growth remains on target with the firm's goal of doubling this business within the next four years. Brian Colello is maintaining the firm's narrow moat and raising his fair value estimate as a result of the encouraging quarterly results. “We view the firm's quarterly results as squarely in line with our long-term thesis that Apple can retain customers because it has created modest switching costs around the iOS ecosystem. We will raise our fair value estimate for Apple to $138 per share from $133 thanks to stronger near-term results and slightly more optimistic gross margin and operating expense assumptions. Our narrow moat rating for the company remains intact, and we still view Apple's shares as modestly undervalued today.” 6 more weeks The world's most celebrated groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, saw his shadow on Thursday morning, which (unscientifically) portends six more weeks of winter. The Weather Channel reported that the famed rodent's proclamation read as follows:  "It's mighty cold weather, you've been braving. Is it more winter or is it spring that you're craving? Since you've been up all night and starting to tottle, I, Punxsutawney Phil, shall not dawdle. My faithful followers, I could clearly see a beautiful, perfect shadow of me. Six more weeks of winter, it shall be!" 5 percentage points per year For more than 20 years, Morningstar has recommended buying "unloved" funds--picking up shares of funds in categories that most other investors are selling. Our "Buy the Unloved" strategy involves buying one fund from each of the three equity Morningstar categories the funds that had the largest calendar-year outflows and avoiding those categories with the highest inflows (the "loved").  "Over the long term, going against the crowd has improved results. Since 1993, the unloved groups have beaten the loved categories in most three-year periods. Overall, the unloved beat the loved by more than 5 percentage points annualized from 1993 through the end of December 2016. It works because investors often chase performance, thus signaling which areas may be overvalued or undervalued." 17%  Facebook reported strong fourth-quarter results. The firm's leadership in social networking and online ad markets were reaffirmed with a 17% gain in monthly average users year over year, and healthy gains in average revenue per user. Equity analyst Ali Mogharabi thinks these results are encouraging and validate our wide-moat rating; however, he notes that the firm needs to continue to invest in innovation to further differentiate itself from competitors such as Snap Inc.  "After taking into account Facebook's better-than-expected near-term results, return on the firm's increased 2017 investments, and time value of money (as we roll our model forward), we will increase our fair value estimate to $135 per share, from $127. We view Facebook shares as fairly valued." 0.50-0.75% The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee decided to maintain the federal funds rate at 0.50-0.75% at its meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. The FOMC issued a statement saying that the monetary policy stance remains accommodative, supporting further strengthening in the labor market and a return to 2% inflation.  "In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation … . The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data." $289 Billion With $289 billion in inflows in 2016, Vanguard raked in more fund investor dollars globally than the rest of the fund industry combined in 2016. There were a few factors driving these inflows, but the major reason is costs, said Jeremy Glaser. "Morningstar research has shown that fees are one of the best predictors of good long-term performance. It seems that investors have caught on, and they are looking to Vanguard given its position as the low-cost provider for fund management." 227,000 The U.S economy added 227,000 jobs in January--a big bounceback from the low December number and better than most expectations. Director of economic analysis Bob Johnson gives his take on what's behind the headline number.

An assembly plant that Apple's Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp is setting up in Bengaluru will focus solely on assembling iPhones, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. The source, who asked not to be named because he was not cleared to discuss matters publicly, said Apple and the Indian government were, however, still discussing "the repatriation of long-term profits from local sales and exports." The government of the Indian state of Karnataka said on Thursday it welcomed Apple's proposal to begin initial manufacturing operations in tech hub Bengaluru, its state capital, hinting it is moving forward with plans to assemble iPhones in India. "Apple's intentions to manufacture in Bengaluru will foster a cutting edge technology ecosystem and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally," the Karnataka government said in a statement. Karnataka IT Minister Priyank Kharge told Reuters on Friday he believes Apple will "tentatively begin manufacturing iPhones in the state by the end of April, or beginning of May." A second source familiar with matters told Reuters, however, that no agreement, or memorandum of understanding has so far been finalised with the Karnataka government. The person, who also asked not to be named, said if Apple did go ahead with plans to begin assembling the iPhone, it was likely to do so initially at the plant being set up by Wistron at Peenya on the outskirts of Bengaluru. Apple was not immediately reachable for comment. Joyce Chou, a spokeswoman for Wistron, said its Bengaluru plant is expected to begin producing smartphones sometime in the first half of 2017. She declined to comment on whether it would be a captive iPhone assembly site. Cupertino, California-based Apple, is keen to assemble its phones in India, one of the world's fastest growing smartphone markets. Apple representatives met federal and state government officials in India last week, as it is lobbies hard for tax and sourcing concessions before it begins to assemble iPhones there. Apple described its discussions with Indian officials as open and constructive. Any final decision on manufacturing in India is, however, likely to depend on the government's willingness to concede ground on the concessions Apple seeks. Last month, Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said India would consider Apple's request for incentives with an "open mind."

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Patent Reveals Facebook Seeks to Join the War for the Living Room with new Home Automation Device | Main | Microsoft is piling in Patent Filings for Augmented Reality to get the Leap on Apple » February 04, 2017 Facebook has been granted a Patent for a Tilt Scrolling Feature for a Future Smartphone or Tablet   On January 26 Patently Apple posted a report titled "Surprisingly Facebook was granted a Patent for 3D Gesturing on a Smartphone." This was the same week that the news of Hugo Barra was joining Facebook to lead their Virtual Reality business. The patent that we revealed related to a possible future Facebook smartphone. This week Patently Apple also discovered Facebook's granted patent for scrolling a large image on a tablet by simply tilting the device. While Facebook was granted the patent in October 2016, this week a continuation patent surfaced regarding that invention, proving patent is quite active.   Facebook's patent FIGS. 1A-F are wireframes illustrating scrolling an image by tilting the tablet. FIG. 1A shows the full image, FIG. 1B shows the user tilting the tablet and 1C-1F shows the image moving from left to right.   In describing their invention Facebook states that "When an image is displayed on a screen that is not big enough to display the whole of the image at once, particular embodiments may enable a user to scroll the image in one or more directions, along one or more axes, by using a tilting motion. The image may comprise any visual content that can be displayed on the screen, including, by way of example and not limitation, a photo, a number of photos represented as a photo album, a list of emails, a web page, a map, a visual representation of a library of music, a video game, or a technical diagram.   The computing device may determine a scroll range for the image, measure initial tilt according to a gyroscope, and determine an origin position for the image. Once the computing device receives an indication from the gyroscope that movement satisfying a threshold for activating scrolling has been satisfied, the computing device calculates a progress parameter, based on the input from the sensor(s) and the scroll range. The computing device then updates the presentation of the image based on the progress parameter. As the computing device continues to receive indications from the sensor(s) that movement is detected, the computing device continues to update presentation of the image appropriately. The computing device may also receive user input to re-calibrate the origin position, at which point scrolling may continue based on the new origin position."   As they and others develop video games for the Oculus VR headset, it's obvious that they're planning for these games to play on other Facebook devices.   Facebook filed their latest updated to their granted patent in September 2016 and the U.S. Patent Office published it in January 2017.   About Posting Comments: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Class Action Lawsuit Launched against Apple over Intentionally Breaking FaceTime on iOS 6 | Main | Facebook has been granted a Patent for a Tilt Scrolling Feature for a Future Smartphone or Tablet » February 04, 2017 Patent Reveals Facebook Seeks to Join the War for the Living Room with new Home Automation Device   Facebook surprised us in January when we discovered they had been granted a patent for 3D gesturing on a possible future smartphone. Then this week we discovered another Facebook patent illustrating a possible future tablet that could work with 'tilt scrolling' for games and other multimedia apps. And to top it all off we've discovered that Facebook is working on a Home Automation device and system that will enter them into the home automation war that's still in its infancy between Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft.   Apple's HomeKit is probably the most advanced though more devices are available for Android. During Apple's financial conference call this week, Apple's CEO went out of his way to impress upon the analysts that Apple is deadly focused on advancing home automation in his traditional opening statement.   Tim Cook: "And we're leading the industry by being the first to integrate home automation into a major platform with iOS 10. With Siri and the new Home App in iOS 10, everywhere you go you could easily and securely control all of your home accessories with your iPhone, iPad or your Apple Watch.    The number of HomeKit compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly with many exciting solutions announced just this month including video cameras, motion detectors and sensors for doors, windows and even a water leak.     Perhaps even more importantly, we are unmatched when it comes to securing your home with HomeKit enabled door locks, garage doors and alarm systems.     I'm personally using HomeKit accessories and the Home App to integrate iOS into my home routine. Now when I say good morning to Siri my house lights come on and my coffee starts brewing. When I go into the living room to relax in the evening I use Siri to adjust the lighting and turn on the fireplace. And when I leave the house, a simple tap on my iPhone turns the lights off, adjusts the thermostat down and locks the door. When I return to my house in the evening as I near my home, the house prepares itself for my arrival automatically by using a simple geofence. This level of home automation was unimaginable just a few years ago and its here today with iOS and HomeKit.   With Google breaking out to deliver their own smartphone, it's not hard to see that Facebook is clearly moving into the digital device space that will also be aiming to get ahead of Apple's HomeKit that has yet to really land on Apple TV as a central hub as their patents have suggested."   Facebook's Home Automation Device and System     Facebook's patent FIG. 1 illustrates an example of a network-based environment in which a home automation system; FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating an example home environment in which various embodiments of the home automation system can be utilized.   Facebooks invention relates to a home automation system that provides a short-range, high-speed wireless communication link for enabling automated control of one or more home devices through connection with a social networking system. Traditionally, home automation systems often rely on Wi-Fi to communicate with various home devices for enabling home automation. Reliance on Wi-Fi, however, poses several problems. First, a Wi-Fi signal often cannot reach some areas of a home that are known as "dead zones."   Typical solutions for overcoming these dead zones include amplifying the Wi-Fi signal, setting up multiple access points (APs), or a combination of both. These solutions often lead to the WiFi signal broadcasting beyond the boundaries of the home, thereby resulting in security risks of unwelcomed intruders gaining access to, and/or attacking, the home WiFi signal.   Second, some infrastructure change is often required to enable control of the home devices for home automation. Furthermore, manual configuration of the home devices is needed to set up preferences for every individual in the home. As a result, satisfying every individual's needs can be burdensome, especially when new individuals (e.g., guests) are present in the home.   In contrast, Facebook's invention enables a truly automated home automation system based on user preferences provided by a social networking system, and further allow for a short-range, high-speed wireless connection that is contained within the safe boundaries of the home.   Briefly described, the home automation system employs one or more home automation devices to control various home devices within the home based on detection of one or more users' social profile, where each home automation device is configured to broadcast and communicate via a short-range, multi-gigabit-per-second (MGbps) wireless communication link that can be utilized by the various home devices.   In some embodiments, the wireless communication module is a Wireless-Gigabit (WiGig) adapter that is configured to provide a short-range wireless communication link at a multi-gigabit per second (MGBps) rate.   Each home automation device is further configured to be self-tuning, thereby enabling automatic management of the MGbps wireless communication link.   In some embodiments, a home automation device includes an Ethernet powerline system integrated with a short-range MGbps wireless networking system.   Among other benefits, integration of these two systems advantageously enables a high-speed wireless networking connection that is contained within the boundaries of the home, relieving home users from security risks typical for WiFi systems.   The MGbps wireless networking connection enables one or more home devices within the home to communicate, transmit information, and/or access various online content via a reliable, fast communication link.   Furthermore, such connection enables the home automation device to control the home devices seamlessly based on user preferences retrieved from a social networking system via the same reliable, fast link.   In some embodiments, a home automation device provides a platform for adding on various electronic components that can be physically coupled to the home automation device. In some embodiments, the electronic components include a smoke detector, a carbon monoxide detector, a video streaming camera, an audio system (e.g., a speaker sound system), etc.   In some embodiments, the home automation device provides the capability to operate as a CPU for a user mobile device (e.g., a smart phone, a tablet, etc.). For example, the home automation device provides a "mirror cast" capability to enable, e.g., a smart phone, to launch a movie playing on a screen of the smart phone to another electronic device, e.g., a TV, by using the home automation device to grab frames of the movie from the smart phone.   In some embodiments the home automation device provides reminders to a user at home based on that user's preferences. For example, the home automation device can conjure up calendar event reminders (e.g., birthdays, family get-together, sports game, etc.). In another example, the home automation device can provide a verbal reminder (e.g., Buy milk), e.g., by connecting to a speaker within the home.   In some embodiments, the privacy settings are stored in the preferences store. In one example, a privacy setting limits the social networking system to accessing the transaction history of the financial account and not the current account balance.   As another example, a privacy setting limits the social networking system to a subset of the transaction history of the financial account, allowing the social networking system to access transactions within a specified time range, transactions involving less than a threshold transaction amounts, transactions associated with specified vendor identifiers, transactions associated with vendor identifiers other than specified vendor identifiers, or any other suitable criteria limiting information from a financial account identified by a user that is accessible by the social networking system.   Facebook's patent FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating a process flow for setting up a home automation device; FIG. 6 is a flow chart of a method of managing a communication signal of a home automation system.   At present Facebook's CEO is a big talker and yet a darling of Wall Street. Will Facebook really get into the smartphone race or tablet business? Will they ever have a real digital assistant to compete with Siri, Cortana, Google Assistant, Alexa and others – or is it just bravado?   Oculus VR is anything but a runaway hit due to a lack of content. So while Facebook looks like a hungry tiger wanting to play with the big boys, they're still a paper tiger that's more talk than action. Yet they still have potential to surprise and you can't write them off just yet.   For more on this topic, also see our recent report titled "The Digital Assistant War for Home Automation Device Supremacy is about to get Really Heated."   About Posting Comments: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The Taiwanese company Wistron Corp. will be doing the on ground assembly for Apple in Karnataka. The iPhones manufactured in India will be meant for the Indian market only and will not be exported at the time. Apple in terms of manufacture has demanded a 15 year tax holiday from the government to start the manufacturing process, which is still being negotiated. Apple will soon after launch Apple owned and operated Apple Stores in several major metropolitan cities of India including Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chandigarh and Ahmadabad. Apple Stores will bring about reforms in Apple Care services being offered in India which suffer due to poor operation standards of Apple Resellers. It is safe to say that Apple’s next iPhone, which is also the 10th Anniversary iPhone will be assembled right here in India for the Indian market. Whether this will affect pricing and quality standards is yet unknown.   likethis What's your reaction?

By Eileen Yu for By The Way | February 4, 2017 -- 16:51 GMT (08:51 PST) | Topic: Smartphones An Indian government official has revealed plans for Apple to start manufacturing iPhones at a new facility in Bangalore, which may commence operations as early as April. Priyank Kharge, Minister of IT for the Indian state of Karnataka, said on Twitter that Apple's plans would "foster cutting-edge technology ecosystem and supply chain development" for Bangalore. The state also issued a statement welcoming the iPhone maker's move to begin "initial manufacturing operations". Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron had been roped in to drive the production in Bangalore, which Kharge said would make the Apple smartphone for the local market. The minister told Bloomberg he met with the company's representatives last month, confirming that production at the plant would begin by end-April. Apple shipped 2.5 million iPhones into India last year, while some 78.3 million units of the smartphone were sold globally in the fourth quarter of 2016. The vendor's other manufacturing partner, Foxconn, operated several facilities in its domestic market China, with Apple generating half of its parent Hon Hai Precision Industry's business. India bypassed US last year to become the world's second-largest mobile market, after China. It was estimated to have more than 300 million smartphone users, with this number projected to hit 810 million by 2021. The Indian government in May rejected Apple's application to sell refurbished units of iPhone and iPad in the country, saying this would violate its Hazardous Waste Rules and generate e-waste. It did, however, relaxed local sourcing policies to allow Apple to open retail stores in India, where it currently sold its products through local resellers. According to local laws, foreign entities looking to set up shop in India must sell products containing components of which at least 30 percent were sourced within the Asian country. Several mobile phone makers already operated production facilities in India, including Chinese vendors Xiaomi, Lenovo, Vivo, and Gionee as well as Korean smartphone giant Samsung. According to IDC, more than two thirds of smartphones shipped in India were assembled within the country.

The junk drawer. Tucked away in some corner. The one that has not been opened in over a decade. The one where we threw all our electronic junk over the decades. You’ll find all kinds of stuff there. Old floppy disks, CDs, charging cables and ethernet wires. Chances are you’ll also find an old feature phone in there, most probably a Nokia. The one that you once dropped out of a moving bus. The one you used to play Snake on. Switch it on. It will make that jiggling noise and come to life. Hand it over to a five-year-old and watch the eyes narrow suspiciously. “What is this?” he’ll ask. Then he’ll understand. “Ah, a phone.” He’ll touch the screen and realise it doesn’t work like that. Within five seconds he will figure out that you need to use the buttons. Then he’ll start looking for YouTube Kids, Minecraft, anything remotely familiar. Then it dawns on him. “Where’s the App Store?” There’s no app store, nor are there any apps. Tell him he can’t check out the latest trailer for Cars 3. Or that he can’t play music on Apple Music. “This is stupid,” he’ll say before throwing your beloved Nokia out of a window. He’ll look at you as if you’re a pre-historic dinosaur. “Yes, son,” you think. “We lived like barbarians without apps.”    Essentials   Authy (iOS, Android, web)   Ask experts why the US Presidential race turned out the way it did and they’ll say because of one silly mistake—not securing email accounts by turning on two-factor authentication.

Has Big Plans for Its Fast-Growing Services Business Apple plans to double an already-large business segment in just four years. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Feb 4, 2017 at 11:22AM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is primarily a hardware company. Most of its revenue comes from the sale of iPhone, iPad, and Mac products. Beyond those key product categories, the company generates meaningful revenue from its Apple Watch family of smartwatch products, as well as from the various accessories, such as its well-received AirPod line of wireless earbuds. Apple music running on different Apple products. Image source: Apple. However, one of the most exciting parts of the company's portfolio is the services business, which the company says "includes revenue from Digital Content and Services, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services." This segment has been on a robust growth path for quite some time, with revenue here growing 10% in the company's fiscal year 2015, and then a whopping 22% in fiscal year 2016. In the company's most recent quarter, it reported that services revenue was up another 18% year over year. This isn't a small business, either -- at least in absolute terms. It generated more than $24 billion in the company's last fiscal year, making up more than 10% of the company's consolidated revenue. To really put it into proper perspective, services was Apple's second-largest business by revenue in 2016 -- bigger than the iPad and Mac. On the company's most recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook made public the company's vision for services over the next four years, and it's quite ambitious. Doubling revenue in just four years "Services are becoming a larger part of our business, and we expect the revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company this year," Cook said. Cook then went on to say that Apple "feel[s] great about this momentum" and that the company aims to "double the size of [its] Services business in the next four years". Of course, what Apple's goals are and what happens aren't necessarily the same thing, but the fact that management is willing to put a growth figure out there -- a hard number that investors will now hold Apple accountable for -- speaks to the company's confidence. What would a doubling of this business mean? Put simply, doubling the business from the revenue levels seen in 2016 would mean that, by 2020, Apple's services business will be bringing in about $48 billion. If Apple can get the business to that scale and then grow it at a modest rate from that point forward (perhaps 5% to 10% annually), then that would do wonders for Apple's longer-term revenue growth prospects. What's not entirely clear, however, is how that growth will translate into incremental profitability. CFO Luca Maestri said on the call that, on average, the gross profit margin of Services businesses is higher than the corporate average, so an increase in Services mix should help Apple on the gross profit margin front. That said, as Apple scales up its services revenue, it will likely need to drive up operating expenses associated with the business, as well. While I do expect nice growth in profitability from a boost in services, the incremental gross profit isn't all flowing to the bottom line. At the end of the day, if Apple hits its growth target with respect to this growing segment, it should be less dependent on the iPhone and could ultimately see earnings multiple expansion as software/services companies tend to be valued more by investors than pure hardware plays.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Hacker reportedly steals iPhone cracking tools… Hacker reportedly steals iPhone cracking tools used in shooting case By Christian de Looper — February 3, 2017 3:46 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you A hacker has made a bold statement about whether the FBI has the right to hack smartphones that illustrates just how vulnerable everyone's personal data is. Apple and the FBI went to war last year over an iPhone owned by San Bernardino, California, shooter Syed Farook, and whether or not the FBI should be granted access to that phone. Apple argued that doing so set a dangerous precedent for data privacy in general, while the FBI insisted it was a matter of national security. In the end, the battle abruptly ended when the FBI reportedly decided to work with Israeli firm Cellebrite, which said it would be able to hack the phone with or without Apple’s help. Now, however, it seems as though Cellebrite has been hacked — and that hacker has publicly released some of that data to try and send a warning to the FBI. The data includes some code that is reportedly related to the Universal Forensic Extraction Device that can crack iPhones like the iPhone 5c, as well as some Android phones. More: Lawsuit: Apple broke FaceTime in iOS 6 on purpose, blamed it on a “bug” In a Motherboard report, the hacker said the creation of such tools makes their public release inevitable, and that they can subsequently be used by anyone with a bit of technical knowledge — including those who might not have such good intentions. Cellebrite itself refutes the claim that it was hacked, suggesting instead that the dumped code is not source code, and is instead code that can be obtained by customers of the Cellebrite app. A separate Motherboard report says Cellebrite was indeed hacked just a few weeks ago, and Cellebrite claimed at the time that only some customer contact information was stolen. Reports indicated, however, that the company could be lying. Whether Cellebrite did help the FBI or not, and whether this hacker does have real Cellebrite code or not, the message from the hacker is clear: “@FBI Be careful in what you wish for.”

The crop protection concerns centre around the detection of an Apple Maggot in West Kelowna residential area and another in a Kelowna commercial property last year, along with two Brown Marmorated Stink Bugs (BMSB) found near the Penticton canal and another by a Kelowna homeowner. Peter Simonsen, a director with the BCFGA executive, said the presence of both pests spawned immediate protective measures to assess and localize the infestations, but admitted the existing pest control resources are limited both by general effectiveness and insufficient government funding support. "It is clear, with all that is going on in crop protection, that it is time to reactivate a committee of BCFGA members to provide input and to come up with new ways of tackling existing and new pests," said Simonsen in a crop protection committee report presented at the B.C. Fruit Growers Convention on Thursday. An infestation of apple maggots, sometimes referred to as the "railroad worm," will make an apple crop inedible, suitable only for cider or animal feed. The BMSB—actually native to China, Japan, Korean and Taiwan but was accidentally introduced into the United States in 1998—can cause widespread damage to fruit and vegetable crops. The concern with these pests is their ability to multiply and travel up and down the valley, laying eggs and spreading their infestations if not immediately subdued upon initial detection. With regard to the BMSB, Simonsen said the traditional tools for controlling the pest have had limited success in the eastern U.S., as its movement is virtually uncontrollable. "The pest flies far and also can 'hitch hike' on vehicles and exported products. We do not consider that a breeding population is established in our area yet, however, we want to protect our Okanagan area." Detection of these bugs also raised concerns from orchardists about detection response protocols, something BCFGA general manager Glen Lucas says needs to be ironed out this year. "We need to have adequate resources in place for early detection and an adequate response," Lucas said. The BCFGA has also raised concerns about the proposed phase-out of the pesticide imidacloprid, known as Admire, following an environmental assessment that found spray residue levels in waterways harmful to aquatic insects. Simonsen said the BCFGA and Canadian Horticultural Council are advocating for further research to be done before such a pesticide ban is adopted. "…water samples have not been tested in the Okanagan. We will put forward the position that differences in how B.C. uses imidacloprid appear to eliminate the concern of harmful residues in water bodies," said the report.

 President Trump should use an iPhone — here's why Kif Leswing Feb. 4, 2017, 9:00 AM 20,577 facebook linkedin twitter email print Donald Trump listens to his mobile phone during a lunch stop in South Carolina. AP Photo/Matt Rourke President Donald Trump loves to use the bully pulpit. His favorite megaphone is Twitter, often sending tweets from an "old, unsecured Android phone," especially while watching TV at night, according to the New York Times' Maggie Haberman. Trump's aides have tried to take the phone from him, but they've been unsuccessful. Trump sent tweets from Android as recently as Friday.  Photographic evidence suggests his phone is a Samsung Galaxy S3, which was first launched in 2012 and last received an Android security update in 2015.  Experts believe that Trump's phone is a security threat — he could be phished or hacked, experts say. It's even conceivable that someone could hack the device and turn it into a "room bug" listening in on the West Wing or the Oval Office.  It's understandable that Trump may not want the ultra-secure phone that President Barack Obama received, which was only able to communicate with pre-approved people. "This is a great phone, state of the art, but it doesn’t take pictures, you can’t text, the phone doesn’t work, you can’t play your music on it," Obama said last year.  But that doesn't mean the President needs to carry around a security risk. There's actually a middle ground, and while the Secret Service might not love this proposal — iPhones are still commercial devices — it would make Trump much more secure in "the cyber," as he once put it.  Trump should get an iPhone.  It is not a debate among security professionals; Apple's mobile operating system, iOS, is much more secure than Android. Since Apple controls what software runs on iOS, there is generally much less malicious code that is able to infiltrate the device.  Apple also makes lots of decisions that may seem harsh, but are smart from a security perspective. For example, all iOS apps — like Twitter — are forced to use App Transport Security, meaning that their traffic is encrypted.  Apple's iPhone also gained the ire of the FBI in 2016 when the bureau discovered it couldn't extract data from a dead terrorist's iPhone without outside help, because of the way iPhones handle full-disk encryption. And the company that is suspected of provided that outside help, Cellebrite, can't hack recent iPhones, it was discovered in a recent data dump.  Most importantly, iPhones get security updates that patch critical flaws on a regular basis. If Trump was using an iPhone as old as his purported Galaxy S3, it could run Apple's latest operating system, iOS 10, with all the most up-to-date bug fixes.  But an iPhone wouldn't mean Trump would be unhackable. It's still conceivable that a foreign state could use a "cyberweapon" that takes advantage of undiscovered flaws in Apple's code. This kind of cyberweapon, the first of its kind to be seen targeting iOS, was discovered last year.  But Apple fixed those bugs as soon as it learned about them. Not only do similar bugs exist for Trump's Android, but there's no way to fix them, ever, because the Galaxy S3 is no longer receiving updates.  Trump may have some loyalty to Samsung. He tweeted earlier this week — from an iPhone, possibly an aide's — that he encouraged a report that suggested Samsung might bring some manufacturing in the United States. And a Samsung subsidiary paid him $150,000 to give a speech in 2015, according to FEC filings. (Samsung did not respond to a request for comment.) Trump is also from an older generation that's not as good with computers, so perhaps he wants to stick with the technology he's most comfortable with.  But Trump's preference for his old phone should not mean that foreign adversaries should have such a attractive vulnerability to target.  Trump's aides can't get him to stop tweeting, but at the very least they can make sure he uses a more secure smartphone.

The new president has pressured companies to invest in the U.S. and create jobs. Clamping down on share repurchases could help serve his goals. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Feb 4, 2017 at 8:02AM Donald Trump. Image source: Whitehouse.gov. President Donald Trump has taken several bold steps since taking office, but one area seems to be a bigger priority than any other. Trump has been adamant about getting American companies to invest in the U.S. by building factories and plants and hiring American workers. In his inaugural address, he declared that as a central theme of his presidency, imploring American companies to "buy American and hire American." Before he even took the oath of office, Trump said he had struck a deal with United Technologies' Carrier Industries to keep about 800 jobs in Indiana that were slated to go to Mexico. He pressured other manufacturers like automakers to keep jobs in the country, and may have influenced Ford's decision to scrap plans for a new plant in Mexico. Once in office, Trump backed out of the Trans Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade deal, and met with leaders of the Big 3 automakers to urge them to expand in the U.S. While those moves may help curry the favor of Trump's base, their effect on investment in the U.S. is uncertain. The automakers already believe that the auto market is at its cyclical peak, as last year marked a record for vehicle sales, and they are therefore reluctant to invest in new factories. Manufacturing jobs have certainly declined over the past generation, but analysts tend to blame that on automation rather than outsourcing. Trump has supported tax breaks that would encourage companies to bring back money kept overseas. Some see this as step one to getting the companies to invest in American jobs. Others see it as priming the companies to use the money to buy back their own shares. Larry Fink, BlackRock founder and CEO and a member of Trump's "President's Strategic and Policy Forum," recently warned that companies should only engage in buybacks "when they are confident that the return on those buybacks will ultimately exceed the cost of capital and the long-term returns of investing in future growth." Fink mentioned Trump by name twice in his Jan. 24 annual letter to CEOs, saying in part: If tax reform also includes some form of reduced taxation for repatriation of cash trapped overseas, BlackRock will be looking to companies' strategic frameworks for an explanation of whether they will bring cash back to the U.S., and if so, how they plan to use it. Will it be used simply for more share buybacks? Or is it a part of a capital plan that appropriately balances returning capital to shareholders with prudently investing for future growth? President Trump has indicated an interest in infrastructure investment, which has the dual benefits of improving overall productivity and creating jobs, especially for workers displaced by technology. Fink went on to write that infrastructure investing is not a solution to automation taking jobs, saying "businesses will need to increase the earnings potential of the workers who drive returns, helping the employee who once operated a machine learn to program it." Trump has showed himself committed to American jobs. We don't know if he will use his bully pulpit to try to force companies to forgo buybacks, but he might if he follows the logic that doing so would result in the companies instead putting the money to use in ways that would boost American workers. Let's take a look at the issue. A Wall Street favorite Share repurchases, or buybacks, in which a company buys share of its own stock, were once illegal, as they were seen as facilitating insider trading because a company could act on information not available to the public. The SEC changed the rule in 1982, and since then, stock buybacks have become increasingly popular. According to HSBC, American companies have spent $2.1 trillion on repurchases over the last five years. Often called a form of financial engineering by detractors, share buybacks boost a company's earnings per share, not by increasing earnings, but by reducing the number of shares outstanding. The pie is split among fewer shares. Investors to tend to cheer share buybacks due to the lift they give to stock prices, but from a larger economic perspective, and possibly from Donald Trump's point of view, they may be the least efficient form of spending cash. Image source: Getty Images. By allocating money to buy back shares, business are choosing to spend profits on inflating earnings per share instead of potentially investing in the long-term growth of the business by opening new plants, hiring or training new workers, investing in research and development, or even acquiring other companies. Unlike dividends, the other from of returning capital to shareholders, buybacks don't give money to current shareholders that can be reinvested, and they do not add market value to the company, which is based in part on the number of shares outstanding. In other words, no value is being created by repurchases in the aggregate.  Share repurchases are controversial for a number of reasons, but their ability to dissuade companies from investing in long-term growth is certainly one of the biggest. How the pros do it With interest rates especially low in recent years, many companies have taken on debt, not to expand their businesses, but to reward shareholders with buybacks. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) founder Steve Jobs refused to pay a dividend, believing that it meant the company was out of ideas. He also didn't authorize share repurchases. Apple under Tim Cook, however, has taken out $87 billion in debt to fund repurchases, reducing the share count by 1.3 billion in the process, and spending about $125 billion in the process. Part of the reason Apple has done so is because much of its cash is parked overseas and it wants to avoid repatriation taxes, but one could see the Trump administration cutting a deal with the iPhone maker to reduce or eliminate repatriation taxes if it agreed to invest in jobs in the U.S. Apple, with nearly $200 billion overseas, has been demanding such an arrangement for years, and could be willing to invest some of that cash in the U.S. if the tax rate was significantly reduced. Notably FoxConn, its biggest supplier, said it was considering opening a plant in Pennsylvania that would employ 50,000 Americans. Apple is unlikely itself to invest in domestic manufacturing, but since FoxConn assembles iPhones and other Apple products, if it opened a plant in Pennsylvania, it would mean that some Apple products would be made in America, though outsourced to a Chinese company.    Trump has said he would like to make deals with corporations to bring some of their overseas cash back home, though that would likely come with stipulations. Goldman Sachs predicted Trump's tax and repatriation plans would encourage more buybacks as it frees up cash for companies, but BlackRock's Fink scolded corporations in his recent letter for spending so much on buybacks. He noted that the total that S&P 500 companies have spent on dividends and buybacks in the last 12 months is greater than the operating profits they've earned. With $5 trillion in assets under management, the Blackrock CEO's missives attract attention on Wall Street, and if he gets the President's ear, Trump could end up using the bully pulpit to excoriate big business for its excessive buybacks. IBM's (NYSE:IBM) recent misadventures perhaps best illustrate the folly of buybacks. After outlining a goal in 2010 of reaching $20 in earnings per share (EPS) by 2015, Big Blue spent aggressively on repurchases to pump up EPS to meet that target, pouring $70 billion between 2010-2014 into lowering its share count. As a result, however, the business suffered. Revenue at the tech giant has now fallen for 19 quarters in a row, and the company was forced to step back from its $20 EPS goal in 2014. In 2016, adjusted EPS was just $13.59, down 9% from the previous year. In the meantime, IBM has also slashed headcount as the number of employees has fallen by close to 100,000, since its peak in 2014, to 368,000. Considering Big Blue's decision to use profits to reward investors while laying off employees, the company would seem to be a target ripe for Trump's ire. It's not just tech companies that are using this tactic, as manufacturers like GM, Ford, and Caterpillar have all been spending on share repurchases recently. Any attempt by the Trump administration to tackle share repurchases would likely rankle Wall Street, which favors the practice. But as the president looks for more levers to pull to boost the "forgotten men and women" of America, share buybacks may start to look like a worthy target.

One that will see (if rumors are accurate) many handset manufacturers adopt OLED Display technology for their flagship handsets. As for which will come out on top, it’s likely to be one of the usual culprits. However, this year that may not just be Samsung or Google. As Apple is rumored to be entering the fray, so let’s take a look at the possibilities. Image Source: YouTube.com iPhone 8 with an OLED Display Could 2017 be the year that Apple finally catches up with its rivals in the display technology department? Rumors are circling which suggest it is, and it’s hard to believe it will stick with LCD again. Especially when you consider all the hype around the iPhones 10th anniversary. As for what the rumors are saying, apparently Apple will not only include an OLED display, but it will also be flexible. And be curved with almost no bezel, you may be familiar with the no Home Button rumors. It backs up the edge-to-edge-screen rumor, but an OLED display would be something completely different for Apple. If you’re not aware, there are two widely used OLED panels which differ by their color gamut technologies. Many of 2016s devices used Adobe RGB gamut, while others used the more advanced DCI-P3 gamut. Of the two Apple is expected to use the latter due to its ability to provide a wider color gamut and greater brightness. Which will inevitably lead to the iPhone 8 having a much-increased pixel per inch ratio that its predecessors. As well as a resolution which could be somewhere between 2160 x 1080 and 2880 x 1440 pixels. Image Source: Samsung.com (screenshot) Galaxy S8 According to those who may know the Galaxy S8 could be launched as early March 29th. And like its predecessors, it will also have an OLED display. However, what may be different this year is the type of OLED Samsung chooses as those found on the S7 and S7 Edge. And that’s because the older models used the Adobe RGB gamut technology, whereas it’s being rumored the S8 will use DCI-P3 tech. As for the validity of this rumor, no one knows but is more likely that the Galaxy S8 will have it. Why? Because Samsung is currently the market leader for smartphone-sized OLED’s and it provides the world with around 95% of what is available. Another reason why this rumor may, in fact, be accurate is that the Galaxy Note 7 featured the same technology. So there’s no reason why the South Korean giant couldn’t just use it again! Moving onto the design, a long-standing rumor points towards the S8 and S8 Plus both having curved displays. And further, suggests that Samsung could be about to do away with the more traditional flat panel on its flagships. Again, if accurate, this would force it to change screen share and resolution. Meaning that a resolution between 2800 x 1440 and 3840 x 1920 pixels, and an aspect ratio of 2.0 may be possible. Image Source: ReleaseDatePortal Galaxy Note 8 If all of the Galaxy Note 8 rumors are true, it looks as though Samsung could be about to produce a handset with VR as its focus. Why? While the ill-fated Note 7 featured an OLED display, most rumors suggest that will not be the case this time. Instead, an AMOLED super high-density display has been touted, is this true? I don’t know, or believe it, as Samsung is currently the King of OLED and it makes no sense for it not to use it! As for those 4K rumors floating around, that is where VR comes in. As the difference it brings would be hardly noticeable to the naked eye. In fact, the Human eye has trouble noticing any difference in quality above Full-HD. So, 4K must be for when you have the Note 8 strapped to your face using Google’s Daydream view, or Samsung’s own Gear VR headsets. Image Source: Google/YouTube Google Pixel 2 Google must have known it was onto something when it along with HTC created the Pixel and Pixel XL handsets. The release of those handsets catapulted it to a place it could have only dreamed that previous handsets could reach. And as such, 2017 will see a Google Pixel 2, which like the others featured here will have an OLED display. Well, that is if you believe the rumors it will! Additionally, the talk suggests this year’s model will get an OLED upgrade. Which see’s Google change from using an Adobe RGB gamut to the more advanced DCI-P3 gamut as seen on all the devices above. As with the Note 8, this could be due to virtual reality, and the fact that improved brightness of 1000 nits is possible. As well as the fact that an increase in performance is seen in ambient light, and with HDR content. So there you have them four handsets which could all benefit from using OLED display technology in 2017. Is any of this true? To be honest there’s no knowing for sure at this point! However, as soon as one of my colleagues or I hear anything concrete it will be published!

(NASDAQ:AAPL) this week reported it sold 78 million iPhones during the holidays. It has $246 billion in cash. And neither of those was even the headline. The real news is that the Cupertino consumer electronics giant announced it is finally going to make Siri smarter. By now, everyone knows voice-controlled, artificial intelligence assistants are the future of computer interfaces. Amazon’s Alexa is cool and it works. And Ford, Volkswagen, LG and Whirlpool are bringing it to their gear. Meanwhile Siri, despite a five-year head start, has become the butt of incompetence jokes. That’s going to change with the latest version of Apple’s mobile operating system, iOS 10.3. For the first time, Apple will let users share their data across iCloud. Artificial intelligence thrives on data. It needs it to learn. Bits of code, 1s and 0s, structured specifically to interpret digitized data get better with each input. Real, transformative artificial intelligence occurs when machines can make sense of unreliable information, think for themselves and develop unexpected-but-accurate results. Research firm IDC predicts demand for cognitive systems will grow from just $8 billion in 2016 to $47 billion by 2020. “Near-term opportunities for cognitive systems are in industries such as banking, securities and investments, and manufacturing,” said Jessica Goepfert, of IDC. “In these segments, we find a wealth of unstructured data, a desire to harness insights from this information, and an openness to innovative technologies.” Artificial intelligence is already transforming modern life. Every common item that experienced a breakthrough when electrified around the time of the first Gilded Age, will make another great leap in the cognitive era. As an example, 100 years ago, the lives of people were greatly improved by electric lights, heating and the telephone. Now lives will be transformed by intelligent lighting schemes, smart thermostat controls and smartphones that know what we want or need before we ask. Artificial intelligence is transforming how businesses work, too. Software helps companies anticipate and react more efficiently to customers. Digital companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook and Nvidia are making AI the foundation of all their efforts. Likewise, major industrial manufacturers like Ford, 3M and Caterpillar are incorporating AI in their products as fast as they can. And many small companies with AI solutions will emerge as the new Gilded Age rolls forward. You can count on current AI looking less primitive in just a few years, however. Engineers will whittle away at the constraints of current AI applications — sending society hurtling toward a point at which software will exceed human abilities at virtually any intellectual task. While that seems far-fetched, engineers at nonprofit research firm OpenAI note that the progression of machine intelligence is a “double exponential” function: Human-written programs and computing power are getting better at an exponential rate. And self-learning/self-improving software will improve itself at an exponential rate. Development progress may look relatively slow at first, then suddenly go vertical. Microsoft “envisioning guru” Dave Coplin told business leaders in a speech recently that AI is the “most important technology that anybody on the planet is working on today.” He added that it “will change how we relate to technology. It will change how we relate to each other […] It will even change how we perceive what it means to be human.” In the very near term, artificial intelligence is going to make Siri truly smart. AI is creeping up on modern life, and it will ultimately become one of the great investment opportunities of the new Gilded Age. The Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) closed at $129.08 on Friday, up $0.55 (+0.43%). Year-to-date, AAPL has gained 11.45%, versus a 2.60% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Michael Short/Bloomberg, File photo   Alex Webb Bloomberg     Apple attracted a swathe of new iPhone customers over the holiday period, auguring well for a more significant upgrade to its flagship product this year -- and the services revenue that these devices are increasingly generating. The shares climbed to the highest price in more than 17 months. Existing iPhone users upgraded to the latest iPhone 7 models at about the same rate as the iPhone 6S a year earlier, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in a conference call with analysts. Yet Apple still managed to sell 3.5 million more phones in the three months ended Dec. 31, indicating growth was driven by new customers. The iPhone 7 represented a modest update to its predecessor, the 6S, adding water resistance, an improved camera, battery life and processor while retaining similar styling. Expectations are mounting for a more significant upgrade to Apple's flagship product later this year, which is the 10th anniversary of the iPhone's launch. That may persuade more existing iPhone users to open their wallets for the next model. "When we're able to innovate with new generations of products, clearly that plays a role in the upgrade rate," Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said. Apple's research and development budget is growing apace, hinting at new innovations or products in the works. R&D spending jumped 19 percent to $2.9 billion in the first quarter. Apple reported total revenue rose 3.3 percent to $78.4 billion, with earnings of $3.36 a share, in the holiday quarter, exceeding analyst forecasts. The shares gained 6.7 percent to $129.50 at 2:10 p.m. in New York, the highest value since July 2015. Samsung Electronics Co. recalled its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone in September after a fault that caused some batteries to burst into flames. That reduced competition in the market for large, high-end smartphones and likely helped attract new customers, according to New York-based BTIG analyst Walt Piecyk. "Once they get you in their ecosystem, they've got a far better shot at getting you to buy another one of their phones," Piecyk said. "If anything, the fact that it wasn't stickiness and services and upgrades makes you feel better about future growth." Americans are taking longer to upgrade their smartphones, partly because wireless carriers have phased out plans that offer discounts for new devices every two years. That puts more pressure on handset makers to find new customers -- something Apple pulled off in late 2016. Last year, Apple suffered a rare year-over-year revenue decline, as iPhone sales tumbled, particularly in China, where competitors such as Oppo and Vivo introduced cheaper phones with similar performance. In the first fiscal quarter, sales in mainland China grew, excluding the effect of a strong U.S. dollar, Cook said. Cook's response to last year's sales decline was to push more services, such as Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud. These businesses are more profitable than iPhones and iPads, and they increase the chances customers will buy future Apple gadgets because users' apps and data are tightly woven into the company's operating systems. Services revenue grew 18 percent to $7.2 billion in the most recent period. Apple said it aims to double the annual total to more than $50 billion by fiscal 2021. "The App Store is going to be a significant driver of growth," CFO Maestri said. "A lot of it comes from the fact that our installed base of devices around the world continues to grow very well."

The firm is expected to release a major upgrade this year in honor of the tenth anniversary of the iPhone. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber, File)   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     In case you had started to doubt it: People still love the iPhone. Apple announced Tuesday that it sold 78.2 million iPhones in its first fiscal quarter -- a record for any single quarter in the company's history. The tech giant had concerned analysts with a few weak quarters that have raised doubts about the iPhone's staying power. Apple returned to growth for the first time in three quarters. Though its profits slipped 2.6 percent from the same time last year, it touted a record-breaking $78.4 billion in revenue. Both Apple's profit and revenue beat analysts expectations. "We're thrilled to report that our holiday quarter results generated Apple's highest quarterly revenue ever, and broke multiple records along the way. We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch," said Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive. The iPhone was the main force behind Apple's revenue record. Sales of the smartphones made up 69 percent of Apple's revenue in its first quarter, and were up 5 percent from the same time last year. Consumers still turned out to buy the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, despite the fact that Apple didn't deliver as much of an update to the phone line as many had expected. The firm is expected to release a major upgrade this year in honor of the tenth anniversary of the iPhone. But with good reviews, and perhaps buoyed by problems at its archrival Samsung, Apple managed to lead the smartphone market with the iPhone 7 this holiday season, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. Still, the forecast isn't completely rosy for the iPhone -- at least in terms of competition with Android devices. Research firm eMarketer expects that Apple's hold of the smartphone market in the U.S. will stay just about the same in 2017, with a 43.7 percent market share, versus 52.2 percent for Android phones. The company also expects that Android will remain the dominant platform through 2019. As Cook noted, it was a good quarter for Apple hardware. The Mac line, which saw a laptop refresh earlier this year, grew 7 percent year-over-year. But sales of the iPad continued to slide, down 22 percent from the first-quarter last year. Apple's services business, which includes the App Store and iTunes store, saw revenue rise 18 percent from the same time last year. Cook said he expects this segment will double over the next four years. Shares of the company were up more than 3 percent from Apple's Tuesday close of $121.35 after the report was announced.

Richard Lawler, @Rjcc 02.04.17 in Gadgetry Comments 283 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Letter from the Editor "Fail fast, fail often" has become something of a Silicon Valley cliché. And yet, despite best efforts to embrace that mantra, our latest president has managed to make an enemy of many of the Valley's most influential players. The tech industry's biggest names spent the week reacting to and recovering from President Trump's executive order that temporarily prohibits US entry to refugees and citizens from a handful of Muslim countries. Apple, Microsoft, Google, Lyft, Uber and others provided legal and financial assistance to staff and others affected by the ban order. Meanwhile, Uber felt the effects of being on the wrong side of the negotiating table when hundreds of thousands of users deleted the app in protest of its CEO, Travis Kalanick, sitting on the president's economic advisory council. Kalanick eventually caved to pressure from users and employees, but Tesla's Elon Musk said he would stick around for the "greater good." While reports circulated that some customers had canceled Tesla pre-orders, there's likely a bit of difference between the buyer of a $100,000-plus luxury vehicle and that of a $5 rideshare. But, hey, if those fancy electrics don't sell, Tesla's already put its Powerpacks to good use, lighting up California's power grid. One company that isn't having trouble maintaining a user base? Apple, duh. Yes, the iOS juggernaut keeps on rolling. As Nathan Ingraham points out, Apple's taken some big risks this year, what with "few updates to the Mac (and the one big change was quite polarizing), a barely redesigned iPhone with no headphone jack, AirPods that shipped two months late and a new Apple Watch that was a modest improvement to a product still seen as nonessential." But profits were up in the company's first quarter to $18.4 billion. As it turns out, the iPhone 7 managed to turn around a three-quarter decline in iPhone sales — headphone jack be damned! What's more horrifying than losing a much-loved port on your favorite Apple gadget? Aside from the impending loss of some hard-won freedoms, there's also the rise of intelligent machines. This week saw the introduction of a new, wheel-equipped robot from Boston Dynamics and a poker-playing AI that could put "Rain Man" to shame. If you like your horror a little less real, you could always play "Resident Evil 7," the "most terrifying VR game on the market," according to Jessica Conditt. Then again, you could just wake up and check your Twitter feed.

Friday news dumpThe new FCC chairman takes control As the week came to a close, Ajit Pai was busy. On Friday, at his direction, the FCC rolled back a few more items hanging on from its time under former chairman Tom Wheeler. In a move vaguely described as undoing "midnight regulation," the FCC cut off nine internet companies from participation in the Lifeline program that helps low-income households get connected. Also, it dropped investigations into zero-rating traffic policies from AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon that have been criticized for going against the principles of net neutrality.

Most-anticipated is probably support for external storage, so users can choose between replacing their internal drive or adding one via USB. The other big tweak (which wasn't mentioned in the notes) is the addition of "Boost Mode" for PS4 Pro -- toggle it on, and older games that haven't been optimized yet will suddenly take advantage of its upgraded hardware for smoother gameplay, higher frame rates and faster load times.

For the first fiscal quarter ending December 31, Apple reported an all-time high quarterly revenue of $78.4 billion, up from $75.9 billion pulled during the first quarter of 2016. While nearly $32 billion of that came from the Americas, the company shared that 64 percent of overall revenue came from international markets. iPhone sales also shattered internal records, likely thanks in no small part to a busy holiday season, bringing in just over $54 billion in revenue thanks to the 78.29 million units sold during Q1. While sales of Apple’s smartphone were only boosted slightly from the 74.78 million units and $51.6 billion brought in during the first quarter of 2016, Q1 2017 marked the end of a streak that previously saw declining year-over-year iPhone sales for three consecutive quarters.  Revenue for the Mac, Apple Watch, and Services also hit all-time highs, though the iPad struggled to keep up with Apple's other products during the holiday season. The tablet was notably the only piece of hardware that didn't see an increase in sales year-over-year, with iPad sales netting $5.5 billion in revenue this past quarter versus the $7.1 billion of 2016's first quarter.

Last year, the FBI sought Apple assistance in hacking the iPhone 5c owned by Syed Farook, a US citizen, who gunned down 14 people with his Pakistani wife Tashfeen Malik in the California city on December 2, 2015. However, Apple refused to comply with orders with CEO Tim Cook saying that creating such “backdoor” would be “bad for America”. “The protection of people’s data is incredibly important, and so the trade-off here is we know that doing this could expose people to incredible vulnerabilities,” the Apple CEO said. Following Apple’s refusal, the FBI reportedly worked with an Israeli mobile security firm Cellebrite and was able to access the phone and what was stored on the device. In January, a hacker was able to break into Cellebrite’s servers and stole around 900GB of data. The data, some of which was dumped online as a warning to FBI, suggests that Cellebrite had sold its phone cracking technology to oppressive regimes such as Turkey, United Arab Emirates and Russia. The hacker claimed to have extracted the Cellebrite’s Universal Forensic Extraction Device (UFED), a small, laptop-sized device capable of pulling SMS messages, emails, and more from thousands of different mobile phone models including older iPhones like the 5c as well as Android and Blackberry devices. However, it is not clear when any of this code was used in the UFED. Many of the directory names start with “ufed” followed by a different type of phone, such as BlackBerry or Samsung. Talking to Motherboard anonymously, the hacker said, “The debate around backdoors is not going to go away, rather, it is almost certainly going to get more intense as we lurch towards a more authoritarian society.” “It’s important to demonstrate that when you create these tools, they will make it out. History should make that clear,” they continued.

Firefighters were unable to save the building after a fire broke out in the wee hours of Nov. 4. The cause of the fire that destroyed The Apple Farm on Route 444 is still under investigation, Ontario County Sheriff's Lt. Brad Falkey said. "We are kind of in a holding pattern," said Bejan Bahai, co-owner of the family-run business that includes orchards on about 80 acres. "We are not sure what insurance will pay out." He said he hopes to know soon so they can move ahead. In operation for more than 40 years, The Apple Farm has been a popular seasonal destination for its tourism and recreational offerings such as you-pick apples, petting zoo, hiking trails, disc golf and corn maze. The store and bakery that burned down offered fresh apples and a variety of apple products. On Nov. 4, a passer-by smelled smoke in the area of the farm about 3:30 a.m. and called 911. Multiple fire departments responded to the blaze but were unable to save the building that was a total loss. No one was hurt and several goats, pigs, ducks and chickens in a fenced-in area connected to the burning building were safely rescued. A GoFundMe page set up after the fire has raised more than $13,000 in the past three months to help the Bahai family rebuild. Meanwhile, The Apple Farm products are on shelves in an increasing number of Rochester-area stores, including the Rail Side Market and Cafe in Victor, Leo's Bakery and Deli in East Rochester and Hart's Local Grocers in Rochester. The Apple Farm has been operating out of a makeshift store, The Blue Toad cider trailer, next to its burned-down store at 1640 Route 444. The trailer is not open during routine hours and people are advised to call first, Bejan said. "We are trying to do what we can with what we have," he said. Bejan added that he and his family are looking at short-term as well as long-term goals. One idea is to pursue renovation of an old barn on their property to be the new store. A survey on their Facebook page indicated that 70 percent of those who responded thought it was a great idea, he said. But until the insurance comes through, Bejan said the pile of charred rubble must remain and they'll have to wait before making any decisions. ___ By Julie Sherwood Daily Messenger, Canandaigua, N.Y.  (c)2017 Daily Messenger, Canandaigua, N.Y.

Both are expected to incorporate a raft of exciting new features as the two main players in the mobile niche jockey for supremacy. So here is a rundown on all we can expect from the iPhone 8 and Galaxy S8 this year. Image source: Apple designer – YouTube iPhone 8 There is still some debate on whether the iPhone 8 will herald the introduction of wireless charging. But reports this week suggest that the Californian corporation is indeed leaning towards implementing a sophisticated system in the next generation iPhone. According to Apple Insider, Energous has developed a simplified version of its WattUp wireless power transmission system, and this could be heading to the iPhone 8. If this is the case then not only will wireless charging appear in the iPhone 8, but it will be delivered at a longer range than any previous example of the technology. In order to facilitate this wireless charging feature, Apple will fundamentally alter the way that the iPhone 8 is constructed. Central to this will be the introduction of a glass back to the smartphone. It is also likely expected that Apple will remove the Home button from the device, replacing it with a screen-based feature. This will enable Apple to reduce the size of the iPhone 8, while still retaining the same screen size, and even including the largest ever display in the iPhone range if rumors of a third model come to fruition. But more on that later. In accordance with this suggestion, it is also expected that Apple will really slim down the bezels of the iPhone 8, and that the device may benefit from an edge-to-edge display. It is also expected that Apple will introduce curved screen technology with the iPhone 8, with this having been patented previously. And a new speaker design will ensure that this is the slimmest iPhone ever. Producing ever more wafer-thinner devices has been a particular focus for Apple, and the iPhone 8 is set to impress in this department. OLED will finally be introduced into the display of the iPhone 8 as well, while the resolution of the smartphone series is set to be bumped up. Recent rumors have also suggested that a laser sensor will be included for gesture recognition, and that this will have practical benefits in security, while also delivering new functionality. Apple will also embrace virtual reality when the iPhone 8 is released, with the technology becoming increasingly important in the consumer electronics marketplace. Apple VR technology has not yet been established, but we could see links with one of the major VR projects already on the market, while Apple toys with its future strategy. Finally, Apple will likely released three separate models of the mainstream iPhone for the first time. It has been suggested that the new version of the iPhone will be larger than the two traditional models, possibly featuring a 5.8-inch display. Spec increases to RAM, storage, processor speed and cameras can also be anticipated. Image Source: SlashLeaks / Weibo Galaxy S8 The Galaxy S8 will be an extremely powerful performer if the existing rumors about the Samsung flagship are to be believed. For starters, a 3.5 GHz Snapdragon 835 and Exynos 8895 have been linked with the smartphone, with different geographical regions receiving separate models. This powerful processor will be backed up with 6GB of RAM according to some reports, making an extremely formidable combination. One report has even suggested that Samsung has achieved peak speeds of 4 GHz with his new processor, a truly mouth-watering prospect. Samsung has listened to consumers’ concerns about the flexibility of the Galaxy range, and thus it is believed that a 3,000mAh removable battery will be included in the Galaxy S8. This will enable fans of the Android-driven device to fit a battery of their choosing; potentially souping up the smartphone and its lifecycle. The Galaxy S8 could deliver as much as 24 hours of usage on a single charge. It is believed that Samsung will eliminate the headphone jack in the Galaxy S8, essentially following the lead of Apple from last year. Some keen Galaxy consumers have called for the headphone jack to be retained, but a wireless-based music system is more likely. USB Type-C will also form part of the makeup of the Galaxy note 8. Samsung is also expected to remove the Home button from the Galaxy S8 when it is released, and reports have suggested that a fingerprint sensor will be built into the display of the smartphone. This will help with security, and also follow general general trends in the industry, with the major manufacturers now clearly moving towards smaller devices. While Samsung will change the way that music is listened to privately, dual-stereo front-facing speakers will ensure that the Galaxy S8 delivers a powerful audio system. There have also been some eye-catching rumors related to the photographic capabilities of the Galaxy S8. Some reports have suggested that the Korean manufacturer will include a 30-megapixel camera in the next-generation smartphone, truly blowing rivals out of the water. Samsung has pared down the megapixel rating included in the Galaxy S range over these last couple of years, but it could be ready to reverse this policy following a challenging year during which the Galaxy Note 7 caused enormous problems. Pricing Finally, smartphone users are in for a treat this year, as both the iPhone 8 and Galaxy S8 are likely to be frozen in price. Samsung simply doesn’t have enough capital in the marketplace at present to do otherwise, while Apple is likely to follow the lead of its great competitor and ensure that the iPhone is competitive in price terms. Both of these giants of the technology world are set to release ambitious smartphones at affordable prices in 2017, and we can only conclude that the consumer will be the winner.

PHOTO: A hacker has released the tools Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) used to crack one of the San Bernardino attackers’ iPhone online. Last year, the FBI sought Apple assistance in hacking the iPhone 5c owned by Syed Farook, a US citizen, who gunned down 14 people with his Pakistani wife Tashfeen Malik in the California city on December 2, 2015. However, Apple refused to comply with orders with CEO Tim Cook saying that creating such “backdoor” would be “bad for America”. “The protection of people’s data is incredibly important, and so the trade-off here is we know that doing this could expose people to incredible vulnerabilities,” the Apple CEO said. Apple rejects ‘dangerous’ order to hack US shooter’s iPhone Following Apple’s refusal, the FBI reportedly worked with an Israeli mobile security firm Cellebrite and was able to access the phone and what was stored on the device. In January, a hacker was able to break into Cellebrite’s servers and stole around 900GB of data. The data, some of which was dumped online as a warning to FBI, suggests that Cellebrite had sold its phone cracking technology to oppressive regimes such as Turkey, United Arab Emirates and Russia. FBI paid more than $1.3 million to break into San Bernardino iPhone The hacker claimed to have extracted the Cellebrite’s Universal Forensic Extraction Device (UFED), a small, laptop-sized device capable of pulling SMS messages, emails, and more from thousands of different mobile phone models including older iPhones like the 5c as well as Android and Blackberry devices. However, it is not clear when any of this code was used in the UFED. Many of the directory names start with “ufed” followed by a different type of phone, such as BlackBerry or Samsung. New leak shows Pakistani ISPs may have been hacked by the NSA Talking to Motherboard anonymously, the hacker said, “The debate around backdoors is not going to go away, rather, it is almost certainly going to get more intense as we lurch towards a more authoritarian society.” “It’s important to demonstrate that when you create these tools, they will make it out. History should make that clear,” they continued.

With the iPhone 8’s release date all but set for September 2016, analysts and Apple fans alike are closely monitoring any new leaks and speculations surrounding the upcoming flagship’s specs and features. From what could be determined so far, Apple’s iPhone 8 would truly be its best smartphone in years. Speculations about the specs and features of the iPhone 8 have long been emerging in the rumor mill, with numerous leaks and patents pointing to a revolutionary device unlike any smartphone that Apple has released so far. A Trusted Reviews report has summarized many of the iPhone 8’s rumored features, including an A11 Chip, a borderless OLED display, a laser sensor for gesture recognition, and an innovative 15-foot wireless charging feature. While Apple has yet to confirm any of these rumors, the consistency of the emerging speculations is quite noteworthy. Amidst these rumors and leaks, however, two particularly interesting specs and features of the iPhone 8 have managed to attract the attention of numerous Apple fans and mobile tech analysts alike. According to recent speculations, the iPhone 8 might end up being equipped with Qualcomm’s sixth-generation Snapdragon X16 LTE unit, since the chipmaker would most likely be Apple’s partner in the production of the iPhone 8’s modem. [Image by Jirapong Manustrong/Shutterstock] If the iPhone 8 really does come with a Snapdragon X16 LTE modem, the upcoming Apple flagship might very well be the king of mobile devices this year in terms of cellular connectivity. This is because Qualcomm has designed the Snapdragon X16 using a 14nm manufacturing process, which enables the modem to support fiber-like speeds through LTE Cat. 16. The X16 is a big step forward from the X12 modem utilized by the Samsung Galaxy S7 and the LG G5, which could only support Cat.6 LTE. Cat. 16 LTE in a smartphone would be no less than revolutionary. If the iPhone does end up being equipped with the Snapdragon X16 LTE modem, it would, at least in theory, be capable of downloading a full 4K movie (about 100GB in size) in just around 13 minutes. Blu-ray films, which average around 25GB per file, could be downloaded by the iPhone 8 in just around three to four minutes. Of course, the device’s actual download speeds would be dependent on the user’s cellular provider, but the premise of the iPhone 8 being a mobile data monster is a very compelling thought nonetheless. This is not all, however, as new rumors about the device have also emerged about the possibility of one of Apple’s newest innovations making its way to the iPhone 8, as reported by PC Advisor. [Image by Tsvetelin Dobrev/Shutterstock] New rumors about the iPhone 8 have suggested that the embedding of the Home button in the screen of the device would open up a lot of new possibilities for the upcoming flagship. With this in mind, there is a chance that the iPhone 8 might be equipped with a miniature version of the MacBook Pro 2016’s killer feature — Apple’s highly-acclaimed Touch Bar. This particular feature actually makes sense for the iPhone 8, since the rumored all-screen design of the device would be the perfect platform to implement the unique technology. A Touch Bar-totting iPhone 8 would definitely be a hit among dedicated Apple fans and everyday mobile users alike. After all, no device in the current market has implemented a similar feature for their flagships so far. Considering that Apple has every resource and technology to place a Touch Bar on the iPhone 8, there is a good chance that the upcoming smartphone would truly stand out from its competitors this year. The iPhone 8’s release date has not been confirmed by Apple, though speculations are high that the device would be unveiled at pretty much the same time its predecessors were released over the last few years. Thus, while unconfirmed, a September 2017 release date seems very likely. With the iPhone 8’s rumored specs and features in mind, however, September could not come any sooner.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Apple to Augment Intel Chips in Mac with In-House Processors February 4, 2017, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts Google Now is Going Down; Top Five Alternates to Pick From  Lenovo Yoga A12 is an Android Tablet Packed with the Pros of a Laptop Apple is planning to introduce a new chip to the Mac devices that will be built in-house. But that shouldn’t end Apple’s love story with the chips from Intel as Apple’s new in-house processor will not be entirely replacing the Intel processors that have been in for years in Mac. Instead, the company will be introducing to augment the currently used chip so as to offload some of its features to the new processor that’s being developed. That will include the Power Nap features of the Intel processor that has been there to save the battery life. Mac makes use of the Power Nap features to perform tasks while in sleep mode like email downloads and calendar updates, iCloud sync, Time Machine driver backups and a host of other features. Apple is planning to introduce the new chip so as to make it power-efficient, by switching all the tasks from Intel to a more energy-efficient processor. Apple’s latest MacBook Pro did receive some criticism in regard with its battery performance. With the process, Apple will also be able to work further with the capabilities of the Power Nap features. It’s not an entirely new move from Apple, as the company has previously introduced secondary processor to aid the Intel chips. The recently released MacBook Pro came with a dedicated Apple-made chip that was put to dedicatedly handle the Touch Bar. If reports are to be believed, the new processor will fall along the same line. The new chip is likely to make its debut in the new MacBook Pro that will be announced later this year.

We saw a bunch of new concept smartphones whereas the flagships continued to built-up on their predecessors. Barring the Note 7 fiasco, last year was pretty solid in terms of value for money as well. However, leaving the past behind, let's look forward and list down all the new little bits and pieces of innovation we are likely to see in smartphones this year. In other words, let's jot down all the top upcoming smartphones of 2017 which have already been in the news.   Samsung Galaxy S8   Probably the most rumoured smartphone of 2017 right now, the first up on our list is the new Samsung Galaxy S8. However, the company is also expected to launch a Plus variant this time around. Quickly briefing down all the specifications we know so far, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is expected to come in two variants, a 5.8-inch and a 6.2-inch variant both of which will sport a QHD Super AMOLED display coming in with an aspect ratio of 18:5:9. On the inside, the South Korean giant is expected to pack in either a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC or it’s own home-grown Exynos chip. Interestingly, the device is expected to come with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable storage. For the optics, both the variants will come with a 12-megapixel rear facing camera with f/1.7 aperture and 8-megapixel front-facing camera. The camera is said to come with a bunch of new features including the recently rumoured visual search capability. For the battery, the 5.8-inch variant is likely to come with 3000 mAh battery while the 6.2-inch variant will house a 3500 mAh battery. Contrary to previous rumours, the Galaxy S8 will come with a 3.5mm headphone jack. Samsung will not launch the S8 at this year’s MWC this month. Moreover, the official unveiling is expected to take place on March 29 with the release scheduled for sometime in April. The 5.8-inch variant is expected to sell for Euro 799 (approx. Rs 58,000) while the 6.2-inch variant will sell for Euro 899 (approx. Rs 65,000).   LG G6   The next up in the list is going to be showcased at the at the upcoming MWC (Mobile World Congress) which is unlike what LG has been doing in previous years. Probably to capture more sales, LG will launch its LG G6 flagship much before Samsung plays its trump card. The upcoming LG G6 is expected to come with a 5.7-inch QHD+ display with a pixel density of 564 ppi and an aspect ration of 18:9. The screen is said to be bezel-less and the device will fit the screen as big as 5.7-inches inside an almost same shell as the LG G5 in terms of the dimensions. LG G5, if you don't know, came with a 5.3-inch display. The new flagship from LG is also touted to come equipped with Google Assistant, which is exclusively available for Google Pixel and Pixel XL currently. As far as other specs are concerned, the smartphone is likely to sport 3.5mm headphone jack and might use USB Type-C for charging and data syncing. LG is also likely to keep the Hi-Fi Quad DAC for high-quality audio output via headsets, however, we might bid adieu to the modular design as LG is planning to bring water resistant certification to the device as well. Surprisingly, LG is likely to skip Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 SoC which will be this year’s flagship chipset. Further, we don’t really have much information about other specifications as of now, but we expect more of it in coming weeks as we head closer to the MWC 2017.   iPhone 8   Top smartphones of a particular year cannot skip the one which is expected to come from Apple, especially when the Cupertino-based company this year will be celebrating 10 years of iPhone. This year, Apple is expected to unveil three iPhones - a 4.7-inch variant and a 5.5-inch variant sporting LCD panels as before and a 5.8-inch variant boasting a curved OLED panel. We don’t really know about the RAM and battery specifications yet but that has never got people’s attention given iOS’s degree of compatibility with the hardware Apple puts in the iPhones. Moreover, Apple is expected to ditch the traditional Home Button and implement a fingerprint scanner underneath the display. Apple is also working on 3D photography which might debut in the next iPhone. Further, we might see a Dual SIM iPhone this year, if rumours are to be believed. While all this might sound interesting, it is still too early to dig into the expected specifications about the new upcoming iPhone 8.   Xiaomi Mi 6   Xiaomi has also entered the flagship game and honestly, has  acquitted itself well too. Although the company will skip this year's MWC event, the upcoming Mi 6 will debut sometime post MWC. The upcoming flagship from Xiaomi will feature a similar design language as Mi Note 2 boasting a curved display on both sides. For the specifications, Xiaomi Mi 6 will arrive in three different variants with different chipsets. The first variant will be equipped with Helio X30 SoC and will carry a price tag of about 1,999 Yuan (approx. Rs 19,757). The second variant will run on the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset, which was recently showcased at CES 2017, and is expected to be priced at 2,499 Yuan (approx. Rs 24,718). The third variant will also come with the same Qualcomm's chipset but will have a dual-edge curved display similar to Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and will be priced at 2,999 Yuan (approx. Rs 29,667). The Snapdragon 835 variant of the Mi 6 is further rumoured to come in two variants - a 6GB RAM with 256GB internal storage variant, and 4GB RAM with 128GB internal storage variant. Both the variants are said to feature OLED panels with 2K resolution. The other variant of Mi 6 which is said to use the MediaTek Helio X30 processor is rumoured to come only in one option which includes 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage. Mi 6 might feature an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner as well, just like the Mi 5S, will run on Android 7.0 Nougat out-of-the-box and will boast a 12MP Sony sensor at its rear.   Huawei P10     Another manufacturer who is expected to unveil its this year’s flagship at the MWC 2016 is Huawei. The Chinese handset manufacturer is expected to launch two flagships at the event, Huawei P10 and Huawei P10 Plus. Both the P10 and P10 will boast  the by now almost proprietary dual-camera setup at the back with LEICA branding. For the specifications, the P10 is rumoured to feature a 5.2-inch Quad-HD display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels. On the inside, the device is rumoured to pack a HiSilicon Kirin 960 chipset, similar to what we saw on the Mate 9, along with 4GB RAM with 64GB of internal storage and 6GB RAM with 128GB of internal storage. The device will come with Android 7.0 Nougat while the internal storage in both the variants will be expandable. Powering the device will be a 3100 mAh battery inside. Moreover, the P10 Plus will be a lot similar to the regular P10 except a slightly larger display (as mentioned above), a bigger battery at 3650 mAh capacity and two RAM and internal storage variants namely a 6GB RAM + 128GB internal storage variant and 8GB RAM + 256GB internal storage variant. Interestingly, the P10 Plus might feature an Iris Scanner, two fingerprint scanners and a ring-shaped LED flash at the back.   Apart from the above-mentioned smartphones, we also expect Google to release the successor to the Pixel and Pixel XL. The search engine giant is also reportedly working on a cheaper variant for this year.   Other than this, Nokia’s much-awaited comeback has already kickstarted with the launch of Nokia 6, last month while the company is yet to drop the curtains from its flagship. Although the exact name of the device is not unveiled yet, we presume it to be Nokia P1. Further, the company has also confirmed that they are working on a Snapdragon 835 running device, however, we are not really sure if the flagship device will be unveiled at the MWC 2017. Nevertheless, Nokia surely is touted to have something for us at this year’s Mobile World Congress.   Top Smartphones Smartphones Samsung Galaxy S8 LG G6 Mi6 iPhone 8 Nokia Nokia Smartphones Huawei P10 Huawei MWC Mobile World Congress Upcoming Smartphones Smartphones 2017 First Published : Saturday, February 04, 2017 - 14:40 Similar News Top 5 new apps you can explore Apps like Clean Master boon or bane for your Android smartphones?

The Karnataka Government has accepted Apple Inc's proposal to begin manufacturing operations in Bengaluru. According to a press note released by Priyank Kharge, Minister of State for Information Technology and Biotechnology and Tourism, the Karnataka Government is ready to undertake any initiatives that will foster growth in the manufacturing sector and will provide a feasible atmosphere for investment. "Apple's representatives led by Priya Balasubramaniam (VP iPhone operations), Ali Khanafer (Head, Government Affairs), Dheeraj Chugh (Director, iPhone operations) and Priyesh Povanna (Country Counsel) met with Ministers and officials of Government of Karnataka and had positive discussions about the initiatives in manufacturing and possible collaborations with state Government in other areas," said Kharge via the press note. Additionally, Kharge also said that the decision to manufacture iPhones will enhance Bengaluru's reputation as the most viable destination for foreign investment and further validation of the state government's policies aimed at fostering manufacturing innovation and investments in the state. "Apple's intentions to manufacture in Bengaluru will foster cutting edge technology ecosystem and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally," added Kharge. ALSO READ India calling: Microsoft head Satya Nadella to visit later this month Apple had earlier applied to open retail stores in India, with a vision to increase its presence in the fast-growing South-Asian market. Apple currently sells iPhones and other products in India through local distributors, but it lags far behind Samsung and Chinese brands such as Xiaomi, Oppo and Lenovo in terms of market share. India has more than 300 million smartphone users, according to technology research firm Counterpoint. It is projected to overtake the U.S. as the world's second largest smartphone market this year. Therefore, the potential payoff is huge. India's fast-growing middle class presents an obvious opportunity, but with average annual incomes of US $1,500, most of its 1.3 billion people can't afford Apple's expensive products. "If you're importing complete units the taxes for those are increasing and we don't see the government backing down in that regard. For Apple, not having manufacturing in India raises the price of the iPhone even more," said Kiranjeet Kaur, a research analyst at consulting firm IDC.

Reuters | Last Updated: Saturday, February 4, 2017 - 13:48 0 Shares Facebook Twitter Whatsapp  Comment Follow @ZeeNews Bengaluru: An assembly plant that Apple's Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp is setting up in Bengaluru will focus solely on assembling iPhones, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. The source, who asked not to be named because he was not cleared to discuss matters publicly, said Apple and the Indian government were, however, still discussing "the repatriation of long-term profits from local sales and exports." The government of the Indian state of Karnataka said on Thursday it welcomed Apple's proposal to begin initial manufacturing operations in tech hub Bengaluru, its state capital, hinting it is moving forward with plans to assemble iPhones in India. "Apple's intentions to manufacture in Bengaluru will foster a cutting edge technology ecosystem and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally," the Karnataka government said in a statement. Karnataka IT Minister Priyank Kharge told Reuters on Friday he believes Apple will "tentatively begin manufacturing iPhones in the state by the end of April, or beginning of May." A second source familiar with matters told Reuters, however, that no agreement, or memorandum of understanding has so far been finalised with the Karnataka government. The person, who also asked not to be named, said if Apple did go ahead with plans to begin assembling the iPhone, it was likely to do so initially at the plant being set up by Wistron at Peenya on the outskirts of Bengaluru. Apple was not immediately reachable for comment. Joyce Chou, a spokeswoman for Wistron, said its Bengaluru plant is expected to begin producing smartphones some time in the first half of 2017. She declined to comment on whether it would be a captive iPhone assembly site. Cupertino, California-based Apple, is keen to assemble its phones in India, one of the world's fastest growing smartphone markets. Apple representatives met federal and state government officials in India last week, as it is lobbies hard for tax and sourcing concessions before it begins to assemble iPhones there. Apple described its discussions with Indian officials as open and constructive. Any final decision on manufacturing in India is, however, likely to depend on the government's willingness to concede ground on the concessions Apple seeks. Last month, Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said India would consider Apple's request for incentives with an "open mind."

Powell Jobs is founder and president of Emerson Collective, an organization that supports “social entrepreneurs,” people who are improving education, reforming immigration reform and other issues. She is also the founder of College Track, an organization that helps prepare disadvantaged high school students for college. If these pursuits don’t sound like they would lead to an outsized share in one of the world’s largest media companies, consider that Powell Jobs is the widow of Steve Jobs. What can be said about Steve Jobs? That he co-founded Apple AAPL -0.22655188038060717% Apple Inc.

That he transformed the hobbyist computer company into an entertainment and handset juggernaut? The youngest of the millennials probably first encountered a Jobs-overseen product while watching a Pixar film, rather than gazing at a Macintosh computer or iPhone. Jobs had acquired the nascent animation studio from George Lucas in 1986. Almost a decade later, on Nov. 22, 1995, Disney (DIS) released Pixar’s Toy Story, the first computer-animated feature-length film. Pixar went public the week after the film opened. Disney also released Pixar’s A Bug’s Life; Monsters, Inc.; Finding Nemo; and Toy Story 2; and in January 2006 it agreed to acquire Pixar for $7.4 billion in stock. Each Pixar share was exchanged for 2.3 Disney shares and when the transaction closed, Jobs found himself with 138 million Disney shares. He was the company’s largest single shareholder with a stake of about 7.7%. Jobs died on Oct. 5, 2011, and on Nov. 22, 2011 — the 16th anniversary of the release of Toy Story — his Disney shares were transferred to a trust run by his widow, Laurene Powell Jobs. According to a regulatory filing, as of July 2, 2014, the Disney holdings of the former Steven P. Jobs Trust had been transferred to five trusts. The bulk of the holdings, 128,566,602 Disney shares, were held by the Laurene Powell Jobs Trust, although she was the sole trustee of all five trusts, beneficially owning 130,181,925 Disney shares. Trusts named for Powell Jobs and Jobs’ three biological children — Eve Claire, Erin and Reed Paul — each held 461,521 Disney shares. A trust named for Lisa Nicole Brennan-Jobs, Steve’s daughter from an earlier relationship, held 230,760 Disney shares. A subsequent filing showed that by Dec. 31, 2015, Powell Jobs’ beneficial ownership had edged down to 128,301,176 shares. Each of the five previously established trusts now held fewer Disney shares. The Laurene Powell Jobs Trust now held 118,842,808 shares. Powell Jobs was now the sole trustee of a sixth trust, named LPJ 2015 GRAT D Trust, which held 7,894,945 Disney shares. The latest filing from Powell Jobs shows that as of Dec. 31, 2016, she has cut her beneficial stake down to 64,320,416 Disney shares, or a 4.0% stake. The trust bearing her name now held only 40,284,667 shares. No specific details in holdings by trusts or entities under Powell Jobs’ control were provided. According to S&P Capital IQ, Powell Jobs is now the fourth-largest individual Disney shareholder. Now that her holdings have fallen to less than 5%, Powell Jobs is no longer required to reveal her transactions with Disney shares. She could sell all of them without publicly disclosing. Brian Rogers, chairman and chief investment officer of T. Rowe Price (TROW), was bullish on Disney in our latest Barron’s Roundtable. “Disney is one of the world’s great companies and was left behind in last year’s market advance,” he said. Powell Jobs’s current focus is more on societal advances than market advances. Wired’s November issue was guest-edited by outgoing President Barack Obama. Powell Jobs contributed a piece not about the future of entertainment, phones or wearables. She wanted to have her say about undocumented immigrants. Her editorial was titled, “Immigrants Fuel Innovation. Let’s Not Waste Their Potential.” “Granting legal status to undocumented immigrants would unleash massive potential, add an estimated 150,000 new jobs annually, and add $1 trillion to America’s GDP,” she opined.

According to email evidence, Apple forced its users to upgrade to the latest version of its iOS operating system that would eventually deliver a drastic drop in device performance in order to avoid incurring additional data relay costs of the FaceTime service. The lawsuit according to Apple Insider was filed at U.S. District Court in San Jose, Calif., and alleges that Apple intentionally turned off its native video conferencing app for users who were running iOS 6 on their smartphones to get them to upgrade to iOS 7 in 2014. While this may not sound like a big deal, it was not uncommon to hear from a number of users that iOS 7 did slow down older devices like the iPhone 4 and 4s, devices which Apple still continued to sell in markets like India, despite being slow out of the box thanks to newer software. According to the same lawsuit, the move only affected owners of the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s. The class also alleges that Apple did this inorder to avoid additional charges that the company would have to incur because of the technology used to relay FaceTime calls back between 2010 and 2014. The iPhone 4 and 4s were the worst hit with the new iOS 7 software update and ran a lot smoother with iOS 6. When Apple launched its FaceTime service back in 2010, it used two methods to relay the large amounts of data to make the video calling service possible. The first one was a peer-to-peer (P2P) technology which would route both audio and data over a direct connection. The second one was a “relay method” which used Akamai’s servers to relay the same data. While both seemed to be working fine for a while, Apple was hit by a patent lawsuit by VirnetX. In 2012 a jury found that Apple was infringing on VirnetX’s patents and was ordered to $368 million fine which also included the need for Apple to stop using its first P2P technology, which meant that FaceTime calls would become a lot more pricier now that the company had to use Akamai’s servers to relay all those popular, data heavy video calls. In order to avoid big bills, Apple came up with a solution to avoid those charges and included it in iOS 7.0.4. While iOS 7 did come with some fancy new features and a redesign UI, it was also heavy on older smartphones like the iPhone 4 and 4s, which meant that the performance would drop. Turns out that while many uninformed users did fall victim to reduced performance, a percentage of those iPhone 4 and 4S users simply refused to update to avoid the problem. Apple however, was incurring heavy bills at the time thanks to the chunk of users placing FaceTime calls over Akamai’s servers. This is where Apple allegedly put its foot down and broke the FaceTime app, calling it a bug and forcing those users to upgrade to iOS 7 (if they wanted FaceTime to work). With no choice, many had to and this lead to performance drops on the older iPhone models. As per Apple’s own statistics as fished out by Apple Insider, only 11 percent of devices were running iOS 6 back in April 2014. So it remains to be seen whether all of the above information is legit. Additionally this whole lawsuit is based on emails obtained that were allegedly sent across between Apple engineers after the incident took place. The class action lawsuit, seeks to find Apple violated California’s unfair competition law. It also seems to be bordering on a tort termed as ‘trespass to chattels’ which in short, is to do with interfering with one’s possessions.

It was a surprise, because iPhone sales had tapered off in the previous quarter, with many blaming it on the minor improvements compared to previous models. But, apparently, people may have been tired of waiting to update their older phones and were turned off by Samsung's difficulties. These results show that, more than ever, Apple has become dependent on the iPhone for its growth, contributing to 64% of its revenue. In comparison, iPad sales fell by 20 percent. Apple phone sales were undoubtedly helped by Samsung’s fiery battery problems with their Note 7 that was introduced about the same time as the 7.  In fact, Apple passed Samsung and is now the world’s largest phone supplier in this most recent quarter. Lawsuit Aims to Force Apple to Use Lock-Out Technology to Block Texting While Driving According to Strategy Analytics, a market research firm, Apple shipped 800,000 more units than Samsung in this quarter, giving Apple a 17.8 percent market share compared to Samsung’s 17.7 percent. For  2016 Samsung maintained first place, shipping 309 million units to Apple’s 215 million. While Apple and Samsung may be the best selling phones, that doesn’t mean they are the best for everyone. I’ve been trying out two different smartphones from LG and Lenovo's Motorola division that offer their own unique features and compare very favorably to the leaders' models, and in some ways surpass them. LG V20 Image via LG.com The LG V20 is a high-end phone with a large 5.7-inch LCD display. The phone is sturdily constructed with a shock resistant body made mostly of metal. It’s equipped with advanced audio capabilities that allow it to play back high-resolution music files that sound much better than ordinary phones. Most phones are designed to play back MP3s, up to CD quality music files, but because of inferior electronics, can play nothing better. The V20 is able to play music from high-resolution FLAC files up to 192/24, which is close to a vinyl record quality. Just as cameras have been improving on smartphones, expect to see the music player capabilities improve as well. Other features include a very good camera and a second always-on display that sits at the top of the front screen that allows you to access a number of features, as well as providing useful information and displaying your signature. But one of the best features of this phone is that the battery can be replaced by simply snapping off the cover. And yes, it still has a headphone jack. https://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2017/02/03/iphones-announces-record-sales-but-you-dont-have-to-be-stuck-with-one/ load more facebook Share Apple Announces Record Sales for iPhones—But You Don't Have to Be Stuck With One twitter Tweet email Email Related Products The Western Story Lecture #6: The Genres of Western Learning: Novels, Plays, Poems, Essays and Treatises amazon.com History In The News Lecture #2: The 21st American Century or What Amazon or Facebook Says About America amazon.com Klavan and Whittle: Manly Men and Womanly Women amazon.com Editor's Choice George Lopez Yelled at a Woman After He Made a Racist Joke comments Pit Bulls Rip 7-Year-Old's Ears Off; Mother 'Livid' comments The Football is Now Political comments Who knew your inbox could be this informative?

More than 20 firms from the sector were expected to attend a meeting to discuss legal options on the ban, which was expected to have a large impact on Silicon Valley and other tech firms that employ thousands of immigrants. "It's still very early, but the strategy would probably be similar to the San Bernardino iPhone briefs," said one tech sector employee familiar with talks on the condition of anonymity. (Read: Apple asks to block court order to help decrypt iPhone) The source was referring to the coalition which fought a US government order which would have forced Apple to weaken iPhone security to inspect a handset used by one of the shooters in a deadly attack in Southern California in December 2015. Participating in the talks were Google parent Alphabet, Netflix, Airbnb and Twitter, the source indicated. Other firms invited or participating include Adobe Systems, Dropbox, Etsy, Mozilla, Pinterest, Reddit, Salesforce, Yelp, SpaceX and Zynga, according to the source. The talks included "several" member companies of a Washington-based technology policy association, according to a separate source. Trump's order has provoked widespread outrage, including from technology firms, with executives from Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple and Netflix expressing concerns over the ban. The executive order, signed Friday, Jan 27, US time, suspends the arrival of refugees for at least 120 days, and for the next 3 months bars visas for travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Flurry of lawsuits Several lawsuits have been filed over the order, and judges in several jurisdictions have blocked some elements of the directive. In Washington state, Expedia and Amazon filed comments supporting a challenge by the state's attorney general, Bob Ferguson. Amazon stated it had 49 employees born in one of the countries identified in the Trump order and 7 who have received job offers from the tech giant. "We reached out to impacted Amazon employees and dependents and recommended that they refrain from travel outside of the United States until further notice," the statement said. Since Friday, several technology firms and associations have criticized the order and warned it could harm the competitiveness of US tech firms. Microsoft said in a statement Tuesday it would "continue to work directly with employees and their families affected by the executive order, including providing them with legal and other assistance." Ed Black of the Computer & Communications Industry Association said that the "hasty executive order is unlikely to achieve the desired goal and instead damages the principles that make this country a place immigrants aspire to work." Linda Moore of TechNet, another industry group, said the measures "create considerable uncertainty in our nation's immigration system and will adversely impact technology workers who live and work in our nation," and added that the group "opposes all discrimination, including on the basis of race, religion, and country of origin." – Rappler.com Filed under:Donald Trump•Donald Trump immigration ban•immigration ban•tech companies•tech firms•tech firms HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?

US stocks finished little changed, but Apple soared after it said iPhone sales improved in its latest quarter. Stocks jumped in morning trading after payroll provider ADP said hiring by private employers grew stronger in January. Bond prices climbed but the market's gains thinned, partly because investors sold shares of companies that pay big dividends as bond yields rose. Stocks briefly turned higher after the Fed's announcement, but that also faded. The only constant was the big gain for Apple, which pushed technology companies higher. The Federal Reserve left its key interest rate unchanged, just as investors expected. The central bank noted that the job market is getting stronger and inflation is gradually rising, but said it wants more time to monitor the economy. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.85 points, or 0.1%, to 19,890.94. The Standard & Poor's 500 inched up 0.68 points to 2,279.55. The Nasdaq composite, which has a high concentration of technology companies, gained 27.86 points, or 0.5%, to 5,642.65. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks dipped 0.60 points to 1,361.23. Most stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange fell. Apple made its biggest one-day jump six months after its first-quarter profit and sales were better than analysts expected. The company said consumers snapped up its new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and that ended the first slump in iPhone sales. Apple stock rose 7.44 dollars, or 6.1%, to 128.79 dollars. Apple was singlehandedly responsible for the Dow gain and it helped take technology stocks higher. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices reported a profit when analysts expected a loss, and its sales were greater than expected. Its stock climbed 1.69 dollars, or 16.3%, to 12.06 dollars. The ADP jobs survey was better than expected, and the construction, manufacturing, health care and shipping industries all added jobs at a solid pace. The US government will release its own monthly jobs report on Friday. Investors reacted to the hiring report by selling bonds, which are relatively safe investments that are in greater demand when the economy seems weaker. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.48% from 2.44%. Stocks that pay large dividends traded lower as bond yields rose. Dominion Resources dropped 4.43 dollars, or 5.8%, to 71.85 dollars. Dominion also released a weak quarterly report. The S&P 500's energy company index fell for the fifth day in a row. It is down almost 3.5% over that time and has sunk 7% since December 13. Lightweight aluminium products maker Arconic surged after its largest shareholder said the company needs new leadership. Elliott Management nominated five potential directors to Arconic's board. The company said it stands by chief executive Klaus Kleinfeld and that Elliott's moves are not in the best interest of all shareholders. Since Arconic split from Alcoa on November 1, Arconic stock was almost flat and Alcoa has jumped almost 70%. Arconic gained 2.55 dollars, or 11.2%, to 25.28 dollars.

The Cupertino site has been dubbed “the spaceship” because of the UFO-shaped building at the centre of what will be a predominately green site, also complete with a new auditorium for future Apple live events. A popular past time for many local Apple fans is to document the progress of the construction, which is being overseen by design boss Jony Ive, using drones. The latest monthly update shows the solar panels on the spaceship roof, which are nearly all in place now, as well as the impressive auditorium and fitness centre and their surrounding grounds. The estimated completion date remains 2017, though the exact move-in date is still not known.

Apple's fall in the Brand Finance Global 500 ranking after five years at the top comes as the study claims its brand value dropped 27% to $107.1bn over 2016, while Google's rose by 24% to $109.5bn. Lego has replaced Disney as the most powerful brand in the world, according to the ranking. The report said Google remained "largely unchallenged" in its core search business, with its advertising revenues up 20% in 2016. Brand Finance chief executive David Haigh said: "Apple has struggled to maintain its technological advantage. "New iterations of the iPhone have delivered diminishing returns and there are signs that the company has reached a saturation point for its brand." Lego's success followed licensing deals with Star Wars, Harry Potter and the Batman franchise, which would also reinforce the company's brand strength among both children and adults "for years to come", the report said. Meanwhile, Visa and MasterCard's brand value grew by 81% and 58% respectively in 2016 as their core markets continued to move towards a cashless society, Brand Finance said. Coca-Cola and Pepsi both fell in the ranking, by 13 and 12 places respectively, as scrutiny around the marketing of sugary drinks to children gained pace. Fast food outlets McDonald's, KFC and Domino's Pizza continued to drop down the ranking, with their brand value falling by 9%, 27% and 16% respectively. The Global 500 five most valuable brands are: :: 1. Google :: 2. Apple :: 3. Amazon.com :: 4. AT&T :: 5. Microsoft The top five most powerful brands are: :: 1. Lego :: 2. Google :: 3. Nike :: 4.

Now, some of the tools used by the Israeli mobile phone forensics company have found their way to the public, after a hacker stole 900GB worth of data from them, including documents that suggest Cellebrite sold its technology to the governments of Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Russia. Cellebrite’s main product is a laptop-sized device called the Universal Forensic Extraction Device (UFED), which can rip data including  SMS messages, emails, call logs, and more from thousands of different models of mobile phones, as long as the UFED user is in physical possession of the phone. The cache of leaked data includes alleged usernames and passwords from clients for logging into Cellebrite databases. There are also a number of directories for different smartphone brands, with each folder containing various exploits the UFED tool could employ and access via a Python script.  The iOS-related code found in the cache is similar to scripts created to jailbreak iPhones and includes modified versions of Apple firmware altered to break security on older iPhones. However, it seems the tools for cracking the San Bernardino shooter iPhone were not leaked. "The debate around backdoors is not going to go away, rather, it is almost certainly going to get more intense as we lurch toward a more authoritarian society," the hacker that leaked the files wrote. "It's important to demonstrate that when you create these tools, they will make it out."

Xiaochengxu — which translates as mini programs — challenges Apple founder Steve Jobs’ idea of an app store overseen by the maker of the iPhone, the device which marked its 10th anniversary this week. App stores run by Apple and Google generate billions of dollars in revenue globally and for them China is a key target market as its users rely heavily on their phones for daily tasks ranging from grocery shopping to booking nail appointments. WeChat’s parent company Tencent Holdings said yesterday that the function allows users to access merchants’ services without having to download their apps. These would in the past have been downloaded via app stores run by Apple or local companies such as 360 and Tencent’s own platform for Android apps. Tencent said it had seen an “encouraging response” from merchants including Didi Chuxing, Dianping. com, Meituan.com, 58.com, JD, as well as airlines, travel agencies, and hotels. Tencent is not the first company to develop an in-app downloading platform. Chinese internet giant Baidu launched a similar platform in 2013 which it called Light App. “The quality of the content will decide if the user will adopt it massively and drop their current app store, which I don’t think they will do,” said Alexis Bonhomme, co-founder of CuriosityChina, a Beijing-based marketing agency specialising in helping brands market on WeChat. Earlier this month, Apple said app sales in China jumped 90% in 2016. In 2015, Reuters reported that Google, whose services are banned in China, has been looking to relaunch its Google Play app store in the country. The WeChat plan has garnered a mixed response on social media from Chinese users. “I don’t feel like it’s of much use,” wrote one Weibo user.

SHE seemed to have it all: a loving family, successful career and beautiful home.  Then Yvonne Carmichael jeopardised everything by having a torrid affair with a random stranger, ripping apart the cosy trajectory of her life. Yvonne is the lead character in a BBC1 mini-series currently steaming up our TV screens, called Apple Tree Yard.  And while the storyline takes us from the joys of lust to the darkness of rape, it’s rare to see a 50-something female take centre stage in such scenes. Midlife affairs are usually the reserve of testosterone-driven, crisis-ridden males — as if females have no such needs — or so the media world would have us believe. Apple Tree Yard, a dramatised version of a novel by Amanda Coe, challenges pre-conceived ideas about middle-age sex.  It not only affirms that it’s OK for older women to be sexually expressive, it annihilates the myth that we become “invisible” and asexual just because we are ageing. The four-part psychological thriller has prompted a lively debate on this issue and 50-year — old actress Emily Watson, who plays Yvonne, has commented: “Your sexuality doesn’t die with your age. You don’t have to apologise for it.” Ben Chaplin as Mark Costley is the romantic interest for Emily Watson’s character Yvonne Carmichael in the BBC production of ‘Apple Tree Yard’. Picture: Nick Briggs The idea that our sexuality can be compartmentalised as non-existent, especially as we are living longer more vital lives, seems absurd.  While Yvonne’s torrid affair illustrates this explicitly, it also raises the issue of how our latent sexual urges are perfectly ripe to be reignited at this stage of life, depending on our circumstances and responses. “Many women of 50 and beyond succumb to a flagging libido, more difficult arousal and maybe a stale, longtime relationship, by retreating from sex.  "Then they meet someone new and — bam — they feel the excitement that they thought they had left far behind,” says Joan Price, a US author and blogger on senior sexuality. “They feel on fire. Their sex drive — which they thought was dormant — goes into overdrive. It can be quite an amazing and delicious experience. It can also be bewildering and guilt-filled, if a woman has an affair when she’s in a committed, monogamous relationship.” Price, now 72, has first- hand experience of this herself: “I was 57 when I met the man who would become my husband and great love. I had been single for decades, with occasional relationships that didn’t go anywhere — and long dry spells.  "It was distressing, because I knew I was a vibrant, sexual being, but after menopause I seemed invisible to the men I met. Many women report that they feel the same. How glorious it is then, when we meet the right person and that person is as electrified as we are!” The on-screen electricity between research scientist and grandmother-to-be Yvonne, and her handsome lover, Mark Costley (played by Ben Chaplin), is an endorsement of this passionate potential, but is there something missing in our relationship if we yearn to seek those sparks elsewhere? Sex in relationships is not just about sex, but about the connect between a woman and her partner, says Lisa O’Hara, a couple counsellor with Dublin-based clinic Mind and Body Works.  “If lack of libido is an issue for a couple attending for counselling, it can be part of a wider discontent than just the sexual connection. There may be a loss of closeness in general and resentments by the woman towards the partner that have built up over years, which have gone unaddressed.  "If these are addressed in therapy and things improve, sex may be back once again.” However, some of her midlife female clients do develop a stronger curiosity about their own desires and fantasies, once free of fear of pregnancy or of other lifestyle issues that had got in the way, says O’Hara. “Some say ‘I’m out of here’. It totally depends on their unique circumstances and how they feel about themselves.” The myth that we become less sexual as we age was recently explored in research among women aged 55 to 81, titled Sex, Desire and Pleasure: Considering the experiences of older Australian Women.  Research author Bianca Fileborn, a lecturer in the School of Social Sciences at the University of New South Wales, tells Feelgood: “One of the key findings from our research was that women are really diverse — there’s certainly not one way that older women are ‘doing’ sexuality and sexual desire in mid to later life. Emily Watson’s as character Yvonne Carmichael in the BBC production of ‘Apple Tree Yard’. Picture: Nick Briggs “In fact quantitative research carried out in western countries pretty consistently shows that a significant number of older people remain sexually active — usually a majority — at least until they reach ‘deep’ old age, in their 80s and 90s. But even then, a large minority still have sex. “Another key finding for us was that women’s desire for sex didn’t depend necessarily on how older they were, but what else was going on their lives that influenced them.” Irish sexologist Emily Power Smith says she knows women of all ages who, although they’re living with chronic illness and pain, are “determined to find ways to feel sexual”. “Women who enjoy sex will have sexual desire right to the end of their lives and will find creative ways to keep that spark. But I also work with a number of women in their 50s and above, who want to know what all the fuss is about, because they could quite easily never have sex again.  "Inevitably it transpires that they have never really enjoyed sex. As they begin to discover their ability to feel sexual pleasure and arousal, their drives tend to increase.” ONCE we are leading healthy lives low libido seems more related to the kind of sex we are having, rather than our age, she says.  “I know many young fertile women who hate sex and many older women, post menopause, who love it. Increasingly, there is research to show that older women embarking on new relationships report no reduction whatsoever in their sexual desire.” Whatever about the complex rich reality of older women’s everyday sex lives, the screening of Apple Tree Yard may nudge the film and media world towards a more rounded representation of the mature female in all her sensual glory.  And perhaps even encourage women to explore their own sexuality more. There is a growing posse of sexy women in their 50s and older decades, gracing the fashion and beauty world, in recent times, apart from the fact that some of the original supermodels of the ’90s, such as Cindy Crawford, Elle Macpherson and Linda Evangelista are already past the half century mark. This year’s Pirelli calendar also sees photographer Peter Lindbergh tap into the zeitgeist, describing the make-up free portraits of his subjects as a “cry against perfection and youth”.  Some of the high-achieving women he chose to feature were actresses Julianne Moore, 56, Charlotte Rampling, 70, and Helen Mirren, 71. However, despite this celebration of our vitality as we age, we still may have some catching up to do as individuals, says Power Smith. “Women do a lot of self-policing when it comes to behaviour, dress and dating over a certain age. I think we are so conditioned to believe our lives are over once we’re 50 — though this is changing slowly — we get very troubled at the thought of our peers wearing short skirts, or dating younger people. But the rules don’t serve us. They never did. “Only now some of us have the financial freedom, confidence and ability to create new norms. So come on! Let’s break some rules!” Apple Tree Yard, BBC One, Sunday February 5, 9pm 10 ways to feel sexy Senior sexpert, author and blogger, Joan Price, gives us these 10 tips for hot sex after 50: 1. Slo-o- o-w- w down. It takes longer for us to warm up, and this intensifies as we get older. Make the warm-up phase of sex play last hours... or days. 2. Appreciate, decorate, and celebrate your body. Jewellery, lingerie, feathers, fringe, silk, velvet, massage oil, candlelight — whatever looks good and feels good. If you know you look sexy, you’ll feel sexy. 3. Learn what you like. Explore, experiment. If you’re partnered, communicate what you like. 4. Do sexy things on your own to get in the mood long before you get naked. Work out. Swim. Dance. Fantasise a sexy scene. Spend some time humming with a vibrator, reading erotica, or watching porn — or all of these. 5. Have sex during high energy times, when your arousal is strongest, whether solo or partnered. 6. If you’re partnered, kiss and kiss. Kiss sweetly, passionately, quickly, slowly, contentedly, hungrily, lightly. All kinds of kisses help you bond with your partner, warm up, and enjoy the moment. 7. Explore sex toys and other erotic helpers, alone and/or with a partner. Lucky for us that sex toys are easy to find, fun to try, and wow, do they work! 8. Use a silky lubricant. There are many different lubricants made specifically for sex that feel great and enhance (or bring back) the joy of friction. Make applying lubricant an erotic part of sex play. 9. Enjoy the afterglow. If you’re partnered, indulge in quality snuggle time. Solo, don’t get back to your daily life right away — bask in your feelings of wellbeing. 10. Laugh a lot. Laughter is joyful, ageless — and sexy.

Tycoon Martin Sorrell , boss of advertising giant WPP, said he has an "instinctive dislike" of the measures, which has resulted in travel chaos and global protests. Martin said: "No immediate impact we are aware of in the first few days of the ban, but we are concerned about the impact it may have on our people and their families both inside and outside the USA and on innocent people generally. "As the grandson of Eastern European grandparents, who were admitted to the UK in the very late 19th and early 20th centuries, I have an instinctive dislike of such measures." His comments come after a number of prominent tech bosses - at firms such as AirBnb, Twitter, Uber and Tesla - lashed out at Mr Trump’s move. Starbucks also weighed into the debate, saying it will hire 10,000 refugees over the next five years in response to Mr Trump’s indefinite suspension of Syrian refugees. Howard Schultz, the coffee chain’s chairman and chief executive, said in a letter to employees that the hiring would apply to stores worldwide and the effort would start in the United States where the focus would be on hiring immigrants "who have served with US troops as interpreters and support personnel". The bosses of Apple, Google and Facebook also moved to criticise the president’s move. Apple chief executive Tim Cook wrote in a memo to employees: "It is not a policy we support. "We have reached out to the White House to explain the negative effect on our co-workers and our company." Mr Cook did not say how many Apple employees are directly affected by the order, but said the company’s HR, legal and security teams are in contact to support them. "Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do," Mr Cook wrote - an apparent reference not only to the company’s foreign-born employees, but to Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, the son of a Syrian immigrant. The US tech industry relies on foreign engineers and other technical experts for a sizeable percentage of its workforce. Netflix boss Reed Hastings pulled no punches, saying on Facebook: "Trump’s actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all. "Worse, these actions will make America less safe (through hatred and loss of allies) rather than more safe. "It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity." Reed Hastings Business lobby group the Institute of Directors said Mr Trump’s move could "seriously undermine business and trade". The Institute’s head of employment and skills policy Seamus Nevin said: "The sudden, severe and indiscriminate restrictions imposed on passport holders from seven Muslim countries could seriously undermine business and trade. "Both in the US and the UK, a number of industries including tech, rely heavily on highly skilled brainpower from across the world. "If businesses are restricted from accessing workers then many companies may have to rethink where they place their key staff in future, and that would ultimately have consequences for the prosperity of that country. "From a British perspective this will be worrying. "The Prime Minister has only just begun to prepare for a future trade agreement with the United States. "Trade deals are built on stable rules because businesses need certainty if they are to plan for future investments and job creation." Insurance giant Axa UK has said it will accept compensation claims from customers affected by the policy. Although not "technically covered", Axa flagged the unprecedented nature of Mr Trump’s travel ban. In a statement, the group said: "In light of the sudden and unexpected decision by the Trump administration to block entry to the US for nationals from Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Iraq, Iran, Libya and Yemen, Axa Insurance UK confirms that individuals who have been denied entry as a result of the executive order will be able to claim on their policy. "Although not technically covered, we view the current situation as unprecedented and unforeseen and as such we are extending the cover under our policies. "For those intending to travel to, or return from, the United States of America, we recommend allowing extra time due to protests currently taking place at a number of airports."   READ MORE Visit the section home page here KEYWORDS donald trump, muslim, travel Email UpdatesReceive our lunchtime briefing straight to your inbox Related Articles Trump considers travel ban rewrite after stinging court defeat Trump to fight courts over his travel diktat Donald Trump may not appeal the block on his travel ban Donald Trump: I've no doubt we will win travel ban legal battle More in this Section British Airways cabin crew to stage new four-day strike in dispute over pay Wall Street ends week on a high You can make Donald Trump say whatever you want with this new app Call Of Duty could be returning to the Second World War Today's Stories Ryanair resurrects long-haul service concept Liffey Valley events centre denied planning permission EU farmers back IFA fertiliser protest UK growth still expected to soften despite latest boost Lifestyle Ask Audrey: My two-year-old wants to write a Valentine Card to his cousin back in Dingle The stresses of moving house with kids Why Ang Lee is unhappy with the reaction to Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk Walsh sisters bring sibling revelry to the stage More From The Irish Examiner Never be in the Valentine's bad books again with this tasty bacon bouquet This T-Rex attempting to clear snow proves why you should never go outside in a blizzard Postcard delivered to West Cork from Thailand against the odds This guy risked his £1,149 laptop by putting it in a laser cutter and the results will surprise you Happy ending for Cork Airport teddy bear who missed his flight home It's a no...

The Government has already spent €1.8m fighting the landmark decision which says the tech giant secured illegal state aid. Answering questions at a parliamentary inquiry into the case in Dublin, Michael Noonan said he did not think the ruling helped the fight to get multinationals to pay more tax. An investigation by the European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager last year found Apple paid €50 in tax for every one million of profit made outside the US in 2014. The government and Apple are both appealing the decision. At the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr Noonan said: "I don't think (the Commission) were focusing on Ireland particularly. "I don't think Apple worldwide were paying sufficient tax. The argument was that the tax liability was not in Ireland." Mr Noonan added: "I think a lot of decisions in Europe are a mix of technical data and mix of politics and I think there was a political input here." Apple got rulings from Ireland's tax inspectors in 1991 and 2007 about a complex corporate structure involving three subsidiaries - Apple Operations International (AOI), Apple Sales International (ASI) and Apple Operations Europe (AOE) - and how sales were routed through Ireland. Mr Noonan said he was surprised Commissioner Vestager estimated the tax due was €13bn over 10 years. Apple boss Tim Cook rejected an invitation to attend committee hearings on the case. Mr Cook previously appeared at a congressional hearing in Washington DC, where he explained that Apple effectively paid 2% tax rate for its subsidiaries in Ireland, where the headline corporation tax rate is 12.5%. Ms Vestager told the committee during the week that her office's inquiry began in 2013 after evidence from Apple to the US Senate that it had a "tax incentive arrangement" with Ireland. Negotiations are ongoing with Apple for the €13bn to be transferred into an escrow where it would be held until the appeal at the European courts runs its course. In his statement to the committee, Mr Noonan said it was untrue that Ireland treated Apple more favourably. "It is important to take this seriously as it is very damaging for our reputation to be called into question in this way," he said. "This affects how Ireland could be treated by other jurisdictions, damages Ireland's credibility in the international tax debate and inhibits Ireland in pressing arguments that serve our national interest." Mr Noonan said a central aspect of the case is that the economic activity that created the value in Apple's business operations was not conducted in Ireland. "Everyone knows that the iPhone and other well-known Apple products were developed in the US, not Ireland. "Our tax legislation, which reflects international norms, only allows us to tax non-resident companies on the profits that they make in Ireland. "As a result, the bulk of Apple's profits were not subject to Irish tax," he said. Mr Noonan also accused the commission of "attempting to re-write Irish corporation tax legislation".

Read More MUMBAI/TAIPEI: An assembly plant that Apple's Taiwanese manufacturing partner Wistron Corp is setting up in Bengaluru will focus solely on assembling iPhones, a source familiar with the matter said. The source, who asked not to be named because he was not cleared to discuss matters publicly, said Apple and the Indian government were, however, still discussing "the repatriation of long-term profits from local sales and exports." View As Photolist » 5 things Apple CEO Tim Cook said about India during Q1 results conference 16 5 things Apple CEO Tim Cook said about India during Q1 results conference After five-long years, Apple reclaimed its position as the world's top smartphone maker in the fourth quarter of the year 2016. The company beat Samsung to make its claim to the top spot. India too played an impressive role during the quarter, making Apple CEO Tim Cook reiterate his commitment to the Indian market. Here's all that CEO Tim Cook said about India during the company's Q4 earning's call. Demonetisation a great move Apple CEO Tim Cook hailed PM Narendra Modi's demonetisation. The demonetisation drive undertaken by the Indian government is a "great move" in the longer term, Apple CEO said. "It's still definitely having some overhang. But I think in the longer term, it's a great move...," he added. Cash ban blues? Apple reports best-ever quarter in India Despite the cash ban, the US-based iPhone maker performed well in the Indian market. According to a report in economic times, iPhone sales shot up in India in the three days immediately following demonetisation as consumers rushed to buy these devices with their phased-out high-denomination notes and stores booked sales through back-dated receipts. As per trade estimates, over 1 lakh iPhones were sold in these three days, which is around three-fourth of this handset’s average monthly sales. "Despite the demonetisation move in India that created lots of economic pressure there last quarter, despite that, we had all-time record revenue results, and so we were very happy about that," Cook said during the earnings call when asked about the companys performance in India. Apple India revenues grow 56% year-on-year Apple India clocked Rs 9,997 crore in sales in 2015-16, up 56% from Rs 6,472 crore in the year before, as per the company. To make significant investments in India CEO Cook reiterated Apple's commitment to investing in India and added that the company is in talks with the government to open retail stores. "We are in discussions on a number of things, including retail stores, and fully intend to invest significantly in the country and believe it's a great place to be," he said. iPads shining sales growing in India Apple CEO said that while tablet sales have been declining globally, India saw growth. "We posted double-digit growth in both Mainland China and India, as we have expanded distribution channels in those countries and we continue to attract a very high percentage of first-time tablet buyers," he said. The government of the Indian state of Karnataka said on Thursday it welcomed Apple's proposal to begin initial manufacturing operations in tech hub Bengaluru, its state capital, hinting it is moving forward with plans to assemble iPhones in India. "Apple's intentions to manufacture in Bengaluru will foster a cutting edge technology ecosystem and supply chain development in the state, which are critical for India to compete globally," the Karnataka government said in a statement. Karnataka IT Minister Priyank Kharge told Reuters on Friday he believes Apple will "tentatively begin manufacturing iPhones in the state by the end of April, or beginning of May." A second source familiar with matters told Reuters, however, that no agreement, or memorandum of understanding has so far been finalised with the Karnataka government. The person, who also asked not to be named, said if Apple did go ahead with plans to begin assembling the iPhone, it was likely to do so initially at the plant being set up by Wistron at Peenya on the outskirts of Bengaluru. Apple was not immediately reachable for comment. Joyce Chou, a spokeswoman for Wistron, said its Bengaluru plant is expected to begin producing smartphones some time in the first half of 2017. She declined to comment on whether it would be a captive iPhone assembly site. Cupertino, California-based Apple, is keen to assemble its phones in India, one of the world's fastest growing smartphone markets. Apple representatives met federal and state government officials in India last week, as it is lobbies hard for tax and sourcing concessions before it begins to assemble iPhones there. Apple described its discussions with Indian officials as open and constructive. Any final decision on manufacturing in India is, however, likely to depend on the government's willingness to concede ground on the concessions Apple seeks. Last month, Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said India would consider Apple's request for incentives with an "open mind."

Since a Chinese government crackdown on water pollution late last year that shuttered some paper mills, manufacturers, including Long Chen Paper and Paolung International, have rallied and may see a bull run for years to come, according to investors. The trend is showing in Hong Kong as well, where Nine Dragons Paper Holdings surged 28% in January. Taiwan’s paper and pulp index has climbed 19% so far this year, compared with a 14% gain in the biggest 10 suppliers to Apple, including iPhone maker Hon Hai Precision Industry. Paper mills use vast amounts of water from the start of the process when wood is mixed into a slurry. Smaller mills operating in China were shut down by the mainland government in a series of moves aimed at curbing environmental waste, resulting in a reduction of supply and an increase in prices. "It could be a multi-year bull market for paper stocks, spreading from Taiwan to Hong Kong," said David Lu, senior vice-president at Taipei-based Hua Nan Investment Trust, which manages NT$50bn ($1.6bn) of assets. The surge in Taiwan paper stocks began in late December when Xinhua reported that China was looking to double fines on water pollution. Visits from government inspection teams disrupted supply, triggering a rally in the commodity’s price, Huatai Financial Holdings analysts Gong Jie and Yu Liang wrote in a January 24 note. In addition, some paper packaging plants in southern Guangdong province were forced to shut, according to industry portal Paper.com.cn. The measures were part of a broader campaign announced in March by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, after he listed improvements to the environment as a key target in the nation’s five-year plan. Nine Dragons On January 23, Nine Dragons said its six-month net income will rise at least 45% from a year earlier. The forecast trumps analyst estimates, thanks to a more than 40% rally in paper prices in the last two months of 2016, Huatai’s Gong and Yu said. Huatai raised Nine Dragons and Lee & Man Paper Manufacturing to buy from hold. Long Chen Paper has risen 49% this year, compared with a 3.4% gain in the Bloomberg world forest products and paper index. Paolung International has soared 53%. Hon Hai is down 0.6% after posting its first annual sales decline on record. "Paper stocks are only just starting to rise," said Michael On, president of Taipei-based Beyond Asset Management.

Feb 4, 2017| Mut and Pete are talking about the hate the Patriots have been getting this season and especially in Super Bowl week, and why they are the target of so much anger from other fans. You Might Like Transcript - Not for consumer use. Robot overlords only. Will not be accurate. Oh anyway go patriots and falcons getting set here on a Friday night of Super Bowl weekend alongside Pete shepherd it's Monday night's Sports Radio WE DI your phone calls up until ten that Christian arcana. It till midnight it's 61777979. B 37 tax 37. 937. On Twitter at 326 and it mutt and UT WE yeah I see your rival like the patriots yep. We think it's an us against the world mentality. And neither one of us thinks it's gonna be all that close of a game Butler at Indian Indian via. For a couple of minutes let's play the falcons win I library I let you start because you're the nannies to simulate Super Bowls on Madden. At Allen watched the FaceBook southwest flight status sponsored that was an that was the picket outside the box back that I wasn't there was no way to know we could sponsor stuff like that that I don't get a valid old little brown is get in the way out of 500000 dollars for a Apple's lock himself. Solved. You gotta love about Ryan part of from going for people let a falcon how Dickey went first the ball. If you're gonna be a little bit concerned the one big hiccup this year for the page I think it's been a special teams spar is turning the ball for no I think they have corrected that problem obviously no more Cyrus Jones. But Dion Lewis had a fumble a couple of weeks ago you know ought to kick off from. It up for you if you've got to look at the turnover battle. Which by the way when the patriots when it. These numbers would you go it's good back up the whole. When the patriots went eternal though what Stearns legal pad ready to go oh yeah drove it. You know. You use. Also got a host a five hour pregame show you very proud the capsule. But the pictures that Bruce a ridiculous number when they when Leo when they went eternal battle I could tied it up there a 137 and a thirteen regular users on its occupied the penalties 137 of thirteen that when it's when there even. When it was a term about it there for fourteen and five artists went 3441. Okay thirteen. Part of let's put every part of my explanation here decked out there so. If that if they lose eternal battle that's number one opportunity you have to love. What Matt rightist on this six game winning streak eighteen touchdowns and no pictures now has 310 point three yards a game. Completion percentage near 73%. A touchdown passes FL record to thirteen different receivers during that time. And he's a that this is a great step for him this is a radius types that. Ryan has been twentieth 22 on third down to the post season fourth with fifteen forced downs and three touchdowns. So he's also engineered eight consecutive opening drive touchdown so that's why another reason. Both of these teams are red hot scoring in the first quarter so would not shock me. How much are the total as the first quarter to ten and half but I elected I'd like you to go over product by. If Matt Ryan puts up those type of numbers. And they won the turnover battle. Yes I think they can they can win the football game. Audience can be very difficult for him to replicate the kind of numbers she's put up of last six games and the you can you can give me all the stories you want about the page to played on defense are on offense okay. I'm telling you there's attitude there there's a mentality there that I agree I don't think the falcons gonna be prepare for but. If they stay put I do most if they stay within themselves month. And don't get rattled if they do when you fall behind they have a chip I think it absolutely is a must that they won the turnover battle. And they have to put up thirty plus can this team put up thirty plus points on the patriots they can do that I think they have a shot. I think you just put together by far the best way to beat the Mets win the turnover battle you gave the win loss record numbers their drastic and that's the number one thing you look at for the patriots when they lose these games. They lose a turnover battle they they dominate when they win and they lose when they don't so turn overs yes Ryan yes here's the other one I'll give you. And it is is there a possibility that Dan Quinn is able to go back into. The Rex Ryan 2010 defense a playbook and get those young guys inexperienced guys that I've hammer all week. Can't they play jet like defensive game and I mean take away the bill the field. And aired a patriots to beat them on the outside and make him hit passes to. Hogan and now commit chill and Martellus Bennett on the outside because I that's the one in always still sort of stands out to meet. The year Brady was unanimous MVP and they beat the jets 453 couple weeks prior. They looked so different against the jets to three weeks later that it's it was so so jarring. And they took away everything in the the field almost crossing routes the problem is the jets were veteran team with that Rex Ryder knew this team pretty well. In quiz our great success so it's an F but I additional what you just showed that by far the two biggest keys right in turnovers. In their defense can take away that middle the field stuff the young guys played old. He may Brady beach on the outside consistently. That my thought on the patriots and off where thirty points might might get either the thirty points might be but that's. To me that's a really big gift for the Atlanta one thing about the jet game. 2010. And it's tough because of last summer set the stands number one. Number two have a Mac fell I fell and broke my broke up I'm in a fractured mirror minor fraction my hair fell through ice data at the game. Blocking out the game just it was patchy ice and stuff it was hardly a estimates that stance was at that game. At least the jets that you are already beat the patriots early in the year yet early early early and they beat them you know pretty good that deck it was it was a blow up like. They it was their day days so you knew. They're Rex Ryan had a capable despite what happened at the end I had 453. Bird implied that July audit that I did pick and I still content I don't care. I could ever play the auto play affect the one game and my life I swear to god. People that are crazy bike into the butterfly effect again. Would be in that game to re wide and I know that the patriots. The first drive they don't score. Jets come down the field they seem to have done everything correctly and that they missed a chip shot field goal. Patriots big advantage of that the run the jets' twenty yard line or something marched down the field. Crumpler wide open dropped a touchdown pass would have made it seven nothing would change that game in my opinion absolutely. Because the jets were out of they would so. Doubt about that fourth quarter the first half when they didn't score aftershock correct it is always emotionally and score early key they wore the emotional wrecks we're Crumpler drop that pass and pitched acted that it changed it's changed everybody wait he had that screen pass the got picked handles all our dad whispered that that would start with that drop compliment but anyway that was at the Crumpler dropout problem drop in which you're just my border player director of all time Chris is required in my little you know I appreciate your doc brown I'm excited about. Ask Google picks today. That Anthony that's you've nailed it with Greg Ryan turnovers and if the Atlanta Falcons you can pull Dan Quinn special Rex Ryan special. I guess you can hold the patriots under thirty unique winning game thirty point 732 point four and that's how I would try to if you wanna talk about you know can Matt Ryan. Pick apart the patriot defense say and short passes in the middle of the field. You know. Passes between you know five and eight yards and a conflict obviously it's very difficult to cover you always wonder why people don't do whatever play well because it's hard it's very it's very it's lock our beat the system. Yeah exactly. Whom promote their. Golf there's a little vulnerability there again I guess maybe but what I I can't get the stay out of my head is the best defensive yet team. On defense of football is the patriots the only allow an average of four point 03 yards after catch and I think that is going to comment. Played big time with this team the linebackers are really really playing well. Q I cannot say enough about how did what what he has done the last release six gotten better. Yet he's gotten better I mean he's made some impact she's been physical I mean I never thought he got the impact kind of impact you have cable from Detroit. And when Donta hightower is in the game. I don't care who is in the game on the other side it is tough to run against the patriots they did I thought fantastic job a Libya Abdel last week despite when he went down but before that. I do we talked about it and their thoughts on it I knew that hit a patter crap. Was knocked on the work against the patriots GQ can I can just imagine. What they went through in practice. They showed video of blow Laura peroni. It's it has more boring guys that's except as Canada is obviously that's you know we based we mocking yeah I dual mode Bok Kim and post game for not predicting an out running. That's a bell does announce the new style he's the staff Korea football your great player an all pro. You don't really get away with that against a Smart defense team I just thickening and the other the other thing through that got the guy word about this game for the patriots there was care group. His cut six receiving touchdown this year there. Averaged almost 43 yards Audrey look at a vertical stuff. Which are patriots don't give up a lot of big vertical plays we know that now they've they've they don't but that's something to be where we also has a big 37 yard reception. In the playoffs but. You know cables and those guys are going to be good security and the guys scares me out he could see all of Julio Orson new off the radar like you're Gabriel take. Coleman's the guy for me when Coleman catch the ball in the backfield that guy is a freak athletically he can he's one of those guys can be you're taking one yard catch and currently twenty yard gain. The other way and after the attack when you talked about. Has got to be big factor because if they're gonna dink and dunk and try to kill some clock. And Coleman and Freeman on the back you'll become big time targets apps for Matt Ryan Dottie did you raised a great point and that was the Achilles heel and articles that we talked about a lot of forced. Six or seven weeks it was aptly Achilles you'll pay two terrific with the worst team in the NFL allowing. Yeah acts to running backs. Our dog on some of those will route or revenues were up one point it would a worst team and in a well not anymore. But the first half of the season these two weeks six separate project. They were allowing more yards to running backs for the year than any other team in the NFL but they have absolutely correct that they play two good ones by the way it's at every play a lot of quarterbacks who puts a damn good running backs. You know throughout the season. Especially the second half they have they have they have really come on slide beat the deeper it is. Just does not get enough credit because I've seen it every watch it time and time again despite some of the inept offense they play. We've seen them play and a profits before but over the years to give up a whole bunch of yards of people that enough to play like that against this quarterback now that I don't get to rip. I've heard it all before I'm telling you this team. Has an attitude about them. It's there they have an identity that it happened the first 567 weeks of the season. But after the Seattle game. Columns gone whenever it was a combination of a softer schedule they found themselves and they will be a formidable. They'll be a force against them earlier this week I promise you to public spot the patriots to win the turnover battle instincts on I would be too and if they don't they might lose the game obviously just to wrap a dependable running backs. The team that is now give up the most yards per game against running backs that your falcons folks 53 point five yards per game to receiving to backs. That is 32 in football. Seahawks and played a pro sites I Montgomery got hurt. James White James White James White and James went again I Jim is Sarasota on now Marshall Faulk is the patriots fan this week Jimmy how real gem. Any guys come out pollutants are sort of blossom room. Have been a patriot in forty years actually. And down. I wanted to work talk about. Not just marshals are all the other commentators to play. Kurt Warner. Cold War. Lomb these guys. They attacked the patriots won replay. Seattle couple years ago. Or one that suitable. He'd been bought costs which they seem dejected. When the patriots beat Seattle. When he got to admit. And now that. You know everybody's just assumed. That directories had checked all the walls in all of that changed this season. And well the NFL did not release any measurement. Information at all. To the public on that everybody just assumes. It because the NFL. Charges the patriots with. You know. Packed in there at the games with a deep sleep GameStop. They think that everything's fine end dumb so I want and I wanted to ask you guys in your opinion. You know if we do it became. A cut gonna come around. And building up that changed him no why would they change they now go a 150. An oh. Over the next ten years nine plus years sector went eleven super balls in the tenth Super Bowls and Rawle. Ed it will never change your opinion of these which they'll still be talking about the talk parole. And they'll still be talking about spiky even though people like clever target the masses like that don't even know what they're talking about. They don't understand it was a difference of a camera being yes it was arrogant and a Kara being here as opposed to bear you can tape. The the what was going on what's interactive's Dan wasn't in Iraq wasn't even though. Marshall Faulk has he sources fact you backed that says fact it was stated that the patriots taped practices. The guy belongs in the one point over the cuckoo's nest sequel. That's three blocks are scratchy when he metres and a I'd look it's not that the fans are gonna change either right maybe talk about the media and the media will be the played down the middle but the fans after this week committee be paid attention. Nobody is rooting for your team. Absolutely. Nobody there are these patriot fans today the story Luke O'Neill the Washington Post. Pats fan is no longer know or be upset a Brady loses because of his political leanings and this is half of the country right now so. No it is not gonna change. And to be more angry people Pete when the patriots win on site out and I brought this up to last week week before and some short dated Fulham fewer post Sunday. If people have that mentality. About they're going to base there. Our entertainment dollars or viewership. Based on somebody's. Ideology political whatever it is you know what. And movie theaters and sports on television as well just go on business right you're never gonna please anybody know I know this is a different type book. I gathered it's you know polarized and I I understand all that by. My god. I mean there are people out there that hate Bruce Springsteen I don't. Icrc that because of his ideology I've ever gone to a U2 concert back 25 years ago at the garden the old guard maybe thirty years ago. And bottled servicing and in album once on the NC that what was up to get on screen instead I get after twenty minute lecture about Norton Ireland. I hope it's great that. Fine I don't comment appeared lecture on the history lesson you know I wanna be inner I don't wanna be it to but I mean what a typical movie because you like somebody's politics. Or viewpoint Abbe what kind of told it's just don't I don't let me every week about how you're all about a great somebody didn't vote for you like move on with your life at this point. Why is that the Brady to defend. And a president you don't like that's what I understand I went to Brady's responsibility all the all the guy has said is he is my friends think it's crap I'd go officially be supported form. My gut feeling probably set probably yeah. But I don't know. There are a lot of I don't I know a lot of politicians that I haven't voted for that I have voted for. That it doesn't matter I don't personally. I like them because of who they are not because of their political. Point of view my god my you know. Yeah feeling and it's why don't talk politics religion that at home or you know whats with certain company because it always into you know can. I just avoid all that at the board of a step up Big Ten. You know that Ahmet. Base my viewership event thing on somebody's because another wind rain you can separate the two I think if you are under real if you're real thing and Pete. I think you're able to separate if you are casual fan final be angry about the election. That's fine but don't portray it. As it's been portrayed in many places the last 221 days. That you rate fan you care about the teen U by the before you watch the games. And I you're not as bad as much because the political leanings of the coach the quarterback the other team tell me so one person on this planet that doesn't have friends that. You're loyal to to a certain degree sometimes but that you know they have gone. Some rotten things up or maybe not the right did you just does not rod are just things that you don't agree with what you still. They're friends I mean who doesn't have that means all the secrets out there. That that just you know just because Assad went on wanna get pepper sprayed in the face yesterday to squirm at the Red Hat. You know I Jewish law she was thanking the feature set up a good job because they were better protesting quietly got up grade I mean. Do you get vilified for I mean. Honest honest to god. Roll the league. Up set all over yourself let's just cannot whether you know it is what it is not gonna change anything we can block all your ports our airports and streets that you want. Thought you know I'll tell you stock exchange to damn thing you just hope for the best let's take its. I don't know Sonny what's the background there what the hell is that. Might hit oh it's click attend stop on the Green Line. 70. Good for you sunny thanks a way to nobody really got. You have though furcal wanted to say that the dominant Dallas so Lara found out about the app that was part of the best day. And we're bubble or and armor that hurt your arm. A lot when you whatever it might on the air. You remember that back nine. Or call them a recurrence of thousands of miles on it and it than that but I've been napping today at that he got there you go pick you up support you we'll have fun this week on the saw what's what you thought of the game for the Patriots defense on. Yeah so that under it deepen our problem our friend and I had a cute thing is they can get pressure up the middle. And it at least seeing all your hat he's that they've been well law it ain't Cold War with it per cent in the red down a bit. The vehicle went to protect their own and talked out the wouldn't game I've been we've been. For seven in the red zone spotlight then we win the game that's that's that's. Obviously led is red zone defense. Yeah I know but the worst but so are of the I don't know horrible I know. I know but expect that that's how we lose the game on Iran from that perspective and hold them. Three guys sunny if you wanna make the argument and thanks for the call tonight you'll make the argument Donald and three. Spoken it's part of it is what one points as big as they knock it likely they're not going to do that because they don't they allowed touchdowns 72% and the reds. So they're knocking alleges theory you're gonna score seven. So your score at seven and a scorned three I suck at math. That's good for you but I'm pretty sure a quick break we'll come back Pete is here we're taking all year old college you guys been on at the beginning of the show at 617. 77979370. Is your phone number Super Bowl Friday here on WEE. I tell people all the time in Tom Brady would just start out every interview by sand I want to thank you Oakland Raiders. I'll be happy that I you know outlet ago where. That thing happens I'm like oh let ago because think about this if he loses that game he's the kid that lost a home game to the West Coast team in the snow you know so he's outside the next year you know be Bledsoe is backsliding that interstate because of that. You know because we the raiders didn't have to believe that game is over but right at the right herself fat. Well managed to come up with an answer but the came up with something where we're you don't properly on the sidelines or what are you doing all of the other still talking to the linebackers. Teddy and takes its ability to come up with an answer right as it did and I think you're right and twelve minutes later they did. I'm Jim Brown. Another 1 whose bubble had morning crawl out of the al-Qaeda network am Bobble heads central Bobble head number 1213 male and female alike. So it's I don't know judge get the waterworks here in town right or it's Adam I don't know I I would teach the action is a great job done producer the old producer from Jim Rome show I forget as they Kyle Brandt. Peter something to adjust and always he's got to face a -- hunt show is suck showing going I don't know you watch that over my old warrior with a morning good morning football winning football applauding the ball and again Tim Brown says that stop and isn't shelves of well all you get is one big. Fast. A lot of clutch Robbins like for it that's it today. Architecturally than I don't challenge them because they don't know the facts and I don't remember the play that game not telling you yes it's not who was part of it. They had a chance two or three times it was not that game Zack Crockett. It's as a way to that a fall Portland to a pit stop for three yard loss that was a big play that game or two what a place to the disputed first down could run out the clock so. But those bubble heads don't even they don't that's I can't stand there's no challenge to any of these national media people on ESPN. And god died in April that orderly sluggish Stephen A credit we secure Mon. You know with. Your efforts earlier. I don't KC McCain's C a RE McCain seed and and defended himself. As opposed to those chicken bleep A holes like lever it's hard and the body Jones another was from Ohio Goodyear tire gamble hide behind. You know the bosses because they they have dole balls whatsoever I saw the. Zero Lucy Burge did the top five interviews and kitty yesterday's not dated cheap it was updated today I assume that Stephen A would be. In that top five it is Stephen A said today what most of us think that if you're in the media. And you have opinions and you hide. That's something to be scared like you are scared or I don't trust you and Stephen A said that basically about his coworkers today it. On on the highest rated morning show in Boston right now. So I give Stephen hale lot of credit you missed it it's on demand at WEEI dot com he was excellent he's one of the few guys Pete to your point. He just sort of gets it when you say something inflammatory like he BP is patent game on today he ripped Matt Ryan killed the banquet and ecology tomorrow Atlanta. You beyond their second at a time when every. Affluent that the opposite would do but I I plead your point yes absolutely have a real problem when it. You know with with people I just that the corporate lackeys and you know I've seen some of the memos from people I know there they're working ESP NN. Who just cannot believe what they get for memos and what they can't it cannot say. And not dimensional political nonsense that they claim they're not but obviously they are. It is. He it's it's like theatrical voice personal pock proceed ESP in the second two principal brutal absolutely brutal. Bills and a car on a Tom Brady theory we like he's an affront tigers hey bill. Guys are you doing what's up. A personal one it that you keep me on hold I avoided going not my job with my wife prices in the truck. I'm good at. At any time any time bill next time next time you don't wanna do W I've just put your phone at the pretender on hold if she calls us we'll tell your holder called the whereabouts. I've got I've actually done that before your bets reason why don't read the live call and speak. I want taxes and aerial view based the Portland Brady's been going on during the season with his mother being ill. And noticing. Or at least I have that these speed become more retrospective. In retrospect it would forgot whose career. I have the feeling that he made possible. Where are here it's been in this global grit that he wants to go out. You know at the age 45 but I think that may be taken in the back of his head somewhere. It would go against bill would go against everything he said elegy said the truck while your wife's food shopping and listen. People would go against everything you said. And done and acted like the last 24 months it would make it would it would surprise the hell out of me certainly could do it. I I think there is a 0% chance you retires win or lose on Sunday the only residue of a chance Howard gave would be if you got. Cirrus straightaway ahead and got seriously hurt the game OK is a sort of injured some sort of concussion or something some sort of injury. Where he could never be. Except the standards that are so high for him that he could never reach those goals again that would be the only way to even then I think you would be a miniscule passport. That would be the only way I could ever see him walking away is of someone that happen a bad neck injury or up a leg injury arm injury to his throwing hand where. In old columns. Training camp he could not live up to his standards or play at eleven bodies used to play at the Olympic Roberts our injuries backing and try to play as long he can Jim's at a car hi Jim. Priests did. So it's caucus. On the and they are. More. Honest. I don't know what that not much very good at this stuff who hasn't been any bullet not that shocking because you can't what is it what's the point spurt what does that mean. It's an article out Yasser pretend we're in the entertainment only yes unit before illegals only legal in Vegas chuckle say yeah. So so I like such a can't elect the reason. Electric at X and oh that's right. I think they are they are they were on that basis but that's fine arts urged. It is wait wait wait wait an extra passing out. The atmosphere. What this season a popular quote a very popular that was checked Atlanta this book. Yards where a school somewhere between a hundred Torre should shall. There are hundreds of wanton. Got so a lot of people bet a manner that aren't. So I spent about bucks and that thousand autopsies on whether to let people get that correct so that's some straight amount they indicate when I. So they sent a lot of money already. Proposition colonel had a listen now they'll they got to make a city a week ago. Ago. Which they open line that so they have choice. They had open alliance. In a perished number auto attracts a boatload of page on our set all that exposure. So you open mind every blow it like to perhaps. And I'm told that. Or perhaps a return on the forty that are making all the. It's not actually a roller where to go to Vegas at 9 o'clock at him and talk about this which acorn gave the sports book director in Vegas and thanks for your call he. I don't I'd always get a sub par is gonna today. The betting is been is even he's he's ever seen it in the history of Las Vegas whatever that means now if that or is why doesn't move your W dot sort of means that the bottom line had an up or it's even money they don't have to even an out and I think bill's called about ten times and had that theory this week I've ever I. Jay told us under one on Monday when he joined us but he also said there we're not a we're not. What's going to be huge loss for them. Wasn't enough bets you know was really going to be who's going to crush them using a public college football futures that sometimes hurt them hotter one is a big number. I think they are I I don't know why they're getting is the even money they're getting but I am surprised. Beat that it's still three I complete I'm at that stunned I really thought would open at six a six and a half for the patriots put they get caught up. Biggest doesn't know me against pop outs in the books or not. They get caught up in the offensive numbers. Of the pitcher of the the better out of a young daughters out of alignment of the falcons will blow by the ball to when they set date that's. And it's a mistake I think biggest much delighted me has ago that whole cast to be either by Sunday night three and a half. I'll be stunned if it's not least three and out patriots. I think. They're gonna lose a crap I think all the late Monday commitment on the patrons to waddle want to go up to three and a half before and I think Vegas is gonna take a beating. Where it's also ducked a beating because of the patriots are going to cover this game and it's just I just don't think it's I think Vegas thinks. It's going to be close and this it's against the balanced the books out but I think. They do make mistakes occasionally biggest does make mistakes occasionally talk about line six but there weren't getting either money right now Pete there double delight it would if they were getting well that's a that's what I don't get what that takes on by Sunday night I think the late money in dot net it between now. And kick off I think whenever Mozart's reactivate it yet apple get there and they gave gonna get off the right in the all the planning and ago. I'll happily three with the patriots ability to edit ascendant in somebody's got at the start thinking you know what you know I hate the page to hate the patriots played the patriots by. That's my heart alike my money. My kidding here and they'll say and and I thought this way before Lebanon's biggest regret to you ego. You start thinking with you got to do with your head you can't do with your heart when it comes to the stuff especially if related you know big real money yeah yeah are real real money. So what happens is you talk yourself a lot of elect three or four times and say you know what. It's the best of both worlds because. If the patriots went to take the patriots and you bet big government when. It's great but it. If the other topic at the top of Wayne didn't. You can afford to lose it don't say a thousand dollar thousand more like OK well us a thousand but god knows that there was they hold a loss. You know at that what this mentality that that does exist amongst better you know it's as but he got to do with your head but I'll be stuck it's not least three and a happy before I kick off. Joseph is a westar wants Stockwell blind as well weighted. Not to pay down guy named Pete what do what are you talking about even money that oh. Let's cut let's get that guy that's what I said ice that's what I said it's even money now I said but I believe between now and kick off. The late money once people get the Vegas I think it's gonna go on the patriots like that you will move at least a half point. Up but you're totally right it's obvious that I had to move I've spotted. Dobbs started at three up studded hasn't moved and it's all week long. You are now somebody's best Atlanta look him thank you jail and looking at the one Twitter account says that LLG technologies which is a a book based in Vegas took a million dollar bet. On the falcons today plus the because they were the got a two and a half somebody's bed this all come back with some final thoughts from Pete will take your phone calls until ten at 617779. 7937. On the pats winning are they losing and why all your calls. Here on W media. Back at money at night Sports Radio WEEI IP shepherd. Hang it out get us all pumped up the week and we both like the pats comfortably. A late touchdown to pull this thing away what he got there Jane on why plus 2200 if you scored the first touchdown. That is if if if I was a gambling man I have I have an a plus 18100 sliding get the good number someone's strategy that's a better not an undesirable but I was able again I wish I'd. Yeah theoretically had access to but so certain sites that are for fund all leave for for pickles only. I'd get the best numbers there. But if I did do it thirty and a half total yards. Feels that the parties are trying to find this is true were you know these crazy property Kamal but there's a Lady Gaga. Who's performing mayor my good friend Stephanie German not a performing at halftime. Allegedly from the roof. Over from the ceiling rafters were and that's what they want to do yes we want to do but there is a prop bet out there and I can't find what it is where if somebody set themselves on fire you'll win money. That's a true story. You know traffic trying to find that one of these sites I have Gatorade. I. Of who in the soup Lou they bank I got what Lady Gaga having wardrobe malfunction. Yeses plus 600. The angle cease fire be the most physical. Challenging performer she's ever done so that'll be a means you could be flip around in the air means she could be twirling. I'll firemen she's athletic she's in great shape just a tremendous voice. I I have letters back right or I know people think she's quirky and zero what you get rid of that the weird stuff she got a great voices for each count the beef which also wacky. Ashley's she's whacked which is wacky like this week on NFL network hours. Surprise a common poise it's your was your what could not have known as she's keeping her prediction to herself and pictures and toward the patriots approached all of you saw the Arctic she wore. She orbits a red white and blue yup that's also the Texans collars kinda it's also kind of a colors of Houston and no less fatigued call is cut red blue ball whatever it is not a partisan. Patriotic type of thing reaches ID cheap I'd actually gonna pick the patriots yep but the risk of terrorism prop up their somebody sets themselves on fire during halftime performed to with the kind of money at odds soccer if you wanna once like yeah we'll they've taken down the and I forget which sport for Candace today but they had the prop that up. Wool her first song be. And they got weird action on one songs they took that off the board a poker face the song poker face. Got crazy action it like fifteen to one Nintendo won in nine to one of being the first song got clobbered a point at which she says they'd ever get off the hook off the board because there was. Too many bets on base that says projects and I go like this week because I've been on the -- much from watched Knight also not a whole interview today with her and under from network she's good and yes was burger she was excellent. They're very articulate and nor reveal some information. But she said as far as disaster about what's on the replied you know and she says all I can tell you where it's it's gonna bridged the gap between twenty year old and 70. So an hourly sugar played Arctic or album is called joy and Bobby's I've I would pick a new. Song apartments on however albums coming out. Is that you start with but I'm sure all the hits are going to be there as you probably throw some cover suffered that your which is gone before you have to yet it's a boy yeah that. Op Ed as to why we're gonna go to Vegas get a view from Vegas top of the hour. As to where they hour at the number Maloney investments treated us and points out that the Dutch investments pinnacle so pinnacle sports book. Has the game. To add falcons plus three. The juice is now minus 116 so they've they've gone up on what you have the lady get the plus through the falcons the book I'm looking at. Is almost the same thing falcons plus three minus 115 so. It is trending closer to. Patriots minus two and a half and then re happy you idea if this don't keep going this way. But you look at the patriot flat on her feel good and and educate people organ ascended here I think a lot of late morning tomorrow night and Sunday morning afternoon mid afternoon it is going to be on the pitchers for rod above lot of it's got to England minus three at minus 120. And a that a plus three even. So they're taking a lot more patriots actionable Vonn up again or is there were award officers is worldwide provider don't know about the at a poker anymore they're really well not known for. There are their sports book about this. Tom Brady if he scored the first touchdown mean Russia's for the first touchdown off 2200. Move saying ms. james' point. Some believe is pretty good. Erickson he's boss let's get even on the quarterback comparison here he's up with a mutt and Pete tonight hair. They were going on to its. It would then note that can ground earlier yeah it's you know it sounds a little moments all the Eagles this is this the Prada and argued to a tractor but nobody takes any of these guys to task as like your world and nobody good morning guys are the only guys anywhere any type of all heated today so like. Could taken. Even it at the bit more but anyway it's not the point. The point is that call. Well it's not point to talk rule burst although the letter of the law the right call eight based on what Brady's arm was but. Most importantly that was karma for people at my father I was in the lives in 1976. That's an internship program and ultimate cost the patriots the playoff game Joseph Burbank apparently was going crazy. My father always told him go to those comma for people like him and patriots they handled the. At that they really wanted to add camus really was again in 1978 when the patriots have another really good team and chuck said uh huh you know what I just quit right before play Earl Campbell and their pastor realists are approaching University of Colorado that was beautiful and number eleven years of Lebanese old I was just absolutely livid that was a bad year seventy braunfels the finals. Bucky Dent. And that nonsense with the patriots are mean that was the terrible aptly terrible result and the Celtics talk to you before working at a. Brian good thing but my main point I just got sidetracked and put that clip Brady. First or apple Brady verse line to re not compare it to so called insane clearly okay Matt Ryan Indian BP also not hurt that a lot more last. Now very much more intense.

So we all know prevalent on so we know better gradient in anyone's ever quit the sport ever future. Past president dozens. I group that Aaron I think this year Ryan played basing on par with Brady he had that kind a year but overall and is no comparison but this year they were pretty equal except for the 28 to two touchdown ratio which is meant to separate 202 touchdowns which is number Don before which is this. Or not quite accurate guy. And I got that I have no problem Matt Ryan was in repeal the Brady gives a crap I really don't I know he doesn't. It got the attention. Honestly more corn is suitable course but it's just it's funny how it won't forget all instantly. He's also QQ. Saint gritty work then. Eddie quit dolce and the only knock on drugs is not at all.

Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein pressed Tim Cook for comments on Apple’s decision to sue Qualcomm, bringing up a past instance of Cook saying that he hated litigation: “I’ve always hated litigation, and I continue to hate it, and I highly prefer to settle versus battle.” In response to Sacconaghi’s question, Cook explained that he still very much feels the same way about litigation. “I don’t like litigation and view it as a last resort,” he stated. With the Qualcomm lawsuit, Cook stated that Apple did not see another way forward without legal action. According to Cook, Qualcomm was essentially hindering Apple’s plans to innovate by requesting increased royalties for technology it had nothing to do with, while additionally withholding a billion dollars in payments it owed Apple. They were insisting on charging royalties for technologies that they had nothing to do with, and so we were in a situation where the more we innovated with unique features like Touch ID, or advanced displays, or cameras, the more money Qualcomm would collect for no reason, and the more expensive it would be for us to innovate. Cook likened the actions of Qualcomm to the idea of buying a sofa and charging a different price depending on the price of the house it went into: It’s somewhat like buying a sofa and you charge a different price depending upon the price of the house that it goes into. From our point of view, this doesn’t make sense, and we don’t believe it will pass muster in the courts. As for the future, Cook reiterated that he doesn’t like litigation and that if another option presents itself, “that would be great.” Ultimately, however, Cook doesn’t expect Qualcomm to prevail in the courts, but he expects a lengthy legal battle. I don’t like litigation, and so if there’s another way, then that would be great, but at this point I don’t see it. I fully expect at this point in time that it will take some time, but in the end, I think common sense will prevail, and the courts will see it for what it is. So that’s the way I see it. It was announced earlier this month that Apple was suing Qualcomm for $1 billion over patent royalties. Apple then launched another suit against the company in China.

Following several months of negotiations, Apple will start making iPhones in Bangalore within three or four months, said a source from the information and technology ministry of Karnataka, a southern Indian state whose capital is Bangalore. The source added the iPhones manufactured in India will be sold only within the country, which has become a potential market for the US firm. The announcement  yet to be officially confirmed by Apple  comes after the company held talks with Indian authorities seeking certain conditions to produce in the country. Apple specifically asked for tax exemptions for 15 years on its component and equipment imports. The companys Bangalore plant will be its first in India, which has a population of around 1.25 billion and is considered an emerging world economy. Apple, created by Steve Jobs and currently led by Tim Cook, already makes components of its iconic smartphone in other Asian countries, including Taiwan and China. In September 2016, the company launched its latest smartphone model, the iPhone 7 at a price ranging from $649 to $969, depending on its specifications and the country of sale. Apple ended the 2016 fiscal with a net profit of around $45.7 billion, a fall of 14.4% as compared to 2015 when it made a net profit of around $53.4 billion, the biggest annual profit in history for a company.   Enter your email address to subscribe to free headlines (and great cartoons so every email has a happy ending!) from the Latin American Herald Tribune:   RSS Feed [ Home ] [ About Us ] [ Who's Who ] [ Contacts ] [ Help ] Copyright Latin American Herald Tribune - 2005-2015 © All rights reserved

Apple chief executive Tim Cook: Apple will begin assembling iPhones in India by the end of April. The US company has tapped Taiwan’s Wistron Corp to put together its phones in the tech capital of Bangalore in Karnataka, said Priyank Kharge, the state’s information technology minister. Apple executives met him in January and confirmed the timeline, he said in an interview. The start of iPhone assembly in India comes after months of speculation on Apple’s plan for the market, which is led by rival Samsung Electronics. It signals a renewed focus on the country, where it just scrapes into the top 10, as growth begins to slow in China and other more mature markets. Apple is said to have put forward a long list of demands in negotiations with India’s federal government, including a 15-year tax holiday to import components and equipment. “Apple’s iPhones will be made in Bangalore and all devices will be targeted at the domestic market,” said Mr Kharge, IT minister for Karnataka, of which Bangalore is the capital. Mr Kharge said the state will help Apple if it decides to turn to other contract manufacturers in the region. “We did not discuss any other incentives,” he said. Apple didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment. Chief executive Tim Cook said on an earnings call this week that India is “the place to be”. He visited the country for the first time last May as he sought government approval for Apple to open its own stores — a step the company deems critical to developing the iPhone user base across the country. Over the long run however, Apple needs to meet requirements that single-brand retailers source 30% of components from within India. Manufacturing locally will help with that. Making iPhones locally could also score brownie points with the national government. Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants companies to make products in the country as part of his ‘Make in India’ policy, aimed at reaping the benefits that come from manufacturing facilities and jobs. The company shipped 2.5 million iPhones into the country in 2016. While that was its best year ever in terms of revenues and sales, it only ranked 10th among vendors in the December quarter according to Counterpoint Research. Apple accounts for under 2% of shipments in India, where an estimated 750 million smartphones will be sold by 2020.

Mobile by Carrie Mihalcik January 31, 2017 4:32 PM PST @CDMihalcik Enlarge Image The iPhone 7 Plus is Apple's most advanced phone to date. Sarah Tew/CNET Apple is back on top. The company overtook Samsung as the world's top smartphone vendor in the final three months of 2016, according to Strategy Analytics. The iPhone maker captured 18 percent of the global market in the December quarter, said the firm. Apple on Tuesday reported it sold 78.3 million iPhones in the fourth quarter, snapping a three-quarter streak of iPhone unit sales declines. The results, fueled by sales of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, pushed Apple to its highest-quarter revenue and per-share earnings ever. Samsung, which faced a massive Note 7 recall due to faulty batteries, dropped to second place, said Strategy Analytics. Samsung shipped 77.5 million smartphones worldwide during the fourth quarter, according to the firm, a 5 percent drop from the 81.3 million phones it shipped in the final three months of 2015. "This was the iPhone's best performance for over a year, as Apple capitalized on Samsung's recent missteps," Neil Mawston, executive director at Strategy Analytics, said in a statement. "Samsung will be banking on the rumored Galaxy S8 model in a few weeks' time to reignite growth and return to the top spot in quarterly smartphone shipments." Overall, global smartphone shipments grew 3 percent to hit 1.5 billion units in 2016. Rounding out the top five phone vendors for the fourth quarter were Huawei, OPPO and Vivo. The global smartphone market, which has been sluggish in recent years, recovered some due to stronger demand in developing markets like China and Africa, said the firm. 54 iPhone 7 up close: Better camera, water-resistant -- and no headphone jack Does the Mac still matter?

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Growing India Apple is set to start making iPhones in India, minister says by Rishi Iyengar   @Iyengarish February 3, 2017: 6:27 AM ET Apple looks to manufacture in India After months of negotiations, Apple is set to start manufacturing iPhones in the Indian tech hub Bangalore, a government official says. The state of Karnataka, where Bangalore is located, has reached an agreement in principle with Apple (AAPL, Tech30), said Priyank Kharge, the state's information technology minister. Kharge told CNNMoney on Friday that iPhone assembly could start as soon as April at a plant on the outskirts of Bangalore. The plant will be operated by Wistron, an Apple supplier that's headquartered in Taiwan. Apple would neither confirm nor deny the Indian official's remarks. The company said in a statement last week that it has been talking to the Indian government about "expanding" its local operations. Related: Apple has $246 BILLION in cash, nearly all overseas The U.S. tech giant currently sells iPhones and other products in India through local distributors, but it lags far behind Samsung (SSNLF) and Chinese brands such as Xiaomi, Oppo and Lenovo in terms of market share. Apple has been hampered by a rule that prevented it from opening its own retail stores in the country. Foreign retailers can only sell products if 30% of the raw materials used to make them are sourced locally. The Bangalore manufacturing unit could pave the way for the first Apple stores in India. Related: Apple considering legal action over Trump's travel ban Setting up a new plant in India would also be at odds with President Trump's call for American companies to create manufacturing jobs at home. But it looks like Apple has decided India's rapidly ballooning smartphone market is too tempting to resist. The South Asian nation currently has more than 300 million smartphone users, and is poised to overtake the U.S. as the world's second largest market for the devices this year.

Apple has long offered discounted Macs, iPads, and other hardware for students and teachers, and it is now adding a discount for its popular multimedia editing software. Education customers can buy a bundle that includes Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X for $199, a significant savings given they usually cost $299 and $199, respectively, if bought separately. In addition to Apple's flagship audio- and video-editing suites, the bundle also includes three other apps for media producers: Motion 5, Compressor 4, and MainStage 3. Related The Best Video Editing Software of 2016 The Best Video Editing Software of 2016 While many higher-education institutions have multiple licenses of Apple's creative software for their own computer labs, personal copies can come in handy for video students prone to late-night editing sessions at home. If you decide to buy the bundle, Apple will verify your education status and then email you codes to redeem on the Mac App Store, a process that could take a few days. As for the quality of the product you're getting, it's been the subject of intense debate among professionals ever since Apple radically changed up Final Cut Pro back in 2011, nixing pro-level features that were in previous versions like multi-cam editing, XML importing, and external monitor support. Most of those features have since made their way back into the app, which recently earned a PCMag Editors' Choice Award. Logic Pro X, Apple's audio-editing suite, also received dramatic changes a few years ago, but its feature set makes it a bargain compared to its competitors like Pro Tools and Avid, even at the full $199 purchase price.

Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) Feb 3, 2017 at 7:08PM Image source: Apple. The iPhone is by far the most important product in Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) lineup. The device accounted for over 69% of the company's first-quarter sales. After three consecutive quarters of unit sales declines, Apple righted the ship with the release of the iPhone 7 last fall, driving a near-5% increase in unit sales. But more important than the growth in units is Apple's ability to sell its higher-end device, the iPhone 7 Plus. CEO Tim Cook revealed the newest model was the best selling Plus model it's released yet during the company's first-quarter earnings call. The ability to sell higher-end devices is key for the company going forward as it becomes increasingly difficult to grow unit sales. A look at selling prices   Data source: Apple quarterly reports. The first thing that stands out in the chart above is the huge drop in average sales price (ASP) during the previous three quarters. The drop coincides with the release of the lower-priced iPhone SE, which starts at just $399. After a late second-quarter release, sales of the model seemed to peak in the third quarter, resulting in a low $595 ASP for all iPhone units. Apple also faced significant foreign exchange headwinds over the past year. CFO Luca Maestri noted the dollar has strengthened 25% against the basket of currencies where Apple does business since June 2014. That led Apple to raise some of its prices in foreign countries last year. But more iPhone shoppers opted for the high-end iPhone 7 Plus last quarter, leading to a record ASP of $695. That's even more astonishing considering the inclusion of the iPhone SE in those sales. What's so telling about the popularity of the iPhone 7 Plus? Unlike in the two previous Plus models of the iPhone, the 7 Plus included a higher-end camera compared to its smaller-screened sister. That point of differentiation may be what led more consumers to opt for the more expensive device last quarter. The significant demand for the 7 Plus shows that Apple has the potential to drive sales growth by further differentiating the Plus lineup from the standard iPhone model. Instead of just offering a larger screen, Apple can keep its best innovations exclusively for its highest-paying customers before letting them trickle down to the lower-priced models. Such a move would strengthen the position of the Plus model in the simple good, better, best price positioning Apple uses. Just as importantly, the upsell is easy thanks to installment plans -- just $4 more per month gets you the best ever phone, camera, mobile gaming machine, Snapchat device, and so on. But don't get excited just yet There's no doubt that Apple benefited from one of its biggest competitors running into some technical difficulties late last year. Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) had to recall its Galaxy Note 7 after units started randomly exploding due to battery malfunctions. Many Note 7 customers likely ended up buying an iPhone 7 Plus for its similarly sized screen. Cook noted it saw the highest Android switcher rate of any quarter. Obviously, Apple can't rely on Samsung or one of its other major competitors having problems with their large-screen phones every quarter. That's why investors must pay attention to the iPhone ASP going forward to see if last quarter was a fluke or if Apple's differentiation strategy is paying off. If ASP continues to rise, it could bode well if Apple further differentiates its newest Plus model even more from the standard model in the fall. Adam Levy owns shares of Apple.

(AAPL) Smartwatch Is Still Dominant Despite All the Doubt InvestorPlace Brad Moon 2/3/2017 SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL Where the Obamas are headed after the White House 15 celebrities who had epic fails as entrepreneurs © Provided by InvestorPlace The numbers show Apple Watch sales set a holiday record. When Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook went on the attack against claims Apple Watch sales were in the dumpster his comments about record holiday sales were taken with a healthy dose of skepticism. After all, it was his job to talk up his company’s products. Even a similar claim in Apple’s Q1 earnings report seemed questionable, with no detail provided. However, a report on global smartwatch shipments for Q4 2016 supports AAPL’s claims. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 132.12 -0.30 -0.23% The numbers say Apple Watch sales did indeed set a holiday record and took an even larger share of overall smartwatch sales that quarter than in the 2015 holidays. Defending Apple Watch Sales Tim Cook had his work cut out for him after AAPL launched the Apple Watch Series 2 in September. Apple was counting on the new model to boost sales going into the holiday quarter of a year where consumer interest in smartwatches was slipping. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) opted to skip its expected Android Wear 2 smartwatch operating system upgrade. Pebble, the early smartwatch pioneer, would soon collapse and have its assets bought up by Fitbit Inc (NYSE:FIT). When research firm IDC released a report in December saying Apple Watch sales had tanked, dropping 71% from the previous year, Cook went on the offensive. In an e-mail to Reuters, he wrote: “Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year. Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.” The problem was, with a new model just launched and the crucial holiday shopping season ramping up, everyone was expecting AAPL to put a positive spin on Apple Watch sales. And without numbers to back it up, Cook’s statement wasn’t necessarily taken at face value. 10 Companies That Are Bringing Jobs Back to America Even Apple’s Q1 earnings report, where the Apple Watch was noted to have set an “all-time revenue record” didn’t convince everyone. AAPL didn’t spike out any actual number to back that up and the Other division that includes the Apple Watch saw its revenue drop 8% year-over-year. AAPL Wasn’t Blowing Smoke About Apple Watch Sales Research firm Strategy Analytics released its report on global smartwatch shipments for Q4, 2016 (the period corresponding to AAPL’s Q1 2017). In it, global smartwatch sales are shown to have recovered from a slow first half, to mark a 1% increase over 2015. As for the Apple Watch? “Demand for Apple’s new Watch Series 2 as a holiday-season gift in Western markets was surprisingly strong and it enabled Apple to clear a large backlog of smartwatch inventory during the quarter.” According to Strategy Analytics, that translated to a record 5.2 million Apple Watch sales in the fourth quarter, up from 5.1 million the previous year. In addition, while AAPL lost ground in the overall smartwatch market in 2016 — dropping to a 55% share compared to over 65% in 2015 by selling 2 million fewer smartwatches on the year — during the holiday quarter, the company captured over 63% of all smartwatch sales. Where Does This Leave AAPL and the Apple Watch? Apple is still the dominant smartwatch maker, and the Apple Watch Series 2 showed the company isn’t sitting still. Its overall market share dropped to 55%, but it remains firmly on top. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has a New Hero: Services! Second place Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) took a big hit over the holiday quarter, despite releasing a new model of its own, the Gear S3. Samsung’s holiday quarter marketshare dropped from 16% to 9.8%, while its overall marketshare for 2016 dropped from 13% to 11.4%. A collection of other manufacturers from Fitbit to LG took over one third of the market in 2016 (up from 21.6%) showing the increasing diversification of smartwatch sales. The smartwatch market still isn’t setting the world on fire, but despite a slow 2016, any reports of its death are greatly exaggerated. And while AAPL is sharing the market with an increasingly diverse group of competitors, Apple Watch sales have not cratered. They were down overall for the year, but Apple maintained a dominant position and the new Apple Watch Series 2 did indeed propel the company to record smartwatch sales over the holidays. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Apple CEO Tim Cook visits Mumbai on May 18. After months of discussion with India, Apple is now set to assemble iPhones in the country starting by the end of April. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 132.12 -0.30 -0.23% That's according to Priyank Kharge, information technology minister for the Indian state of Karnataka, who discussed the plans in a Bloomberg interview late Thursday. The move into the world's fastest-growing major smartphone market comes at a time when iPhone sales have slowed in key markets such as China. Apple executives met with Kharge in January to cement the timeline, though Apple CEO Tim Cook first met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last May. Apple's iPhones will be made in Bangalore [in Karnataka] and all devices will be targeted at the domestic market, Kharge told Bloomberg. We did not discuss any other incentives. The tech company has reportedly given India a wish list, including demands for tax incentives. Apple has also previously called for a permanent relaxation of laws requiring foreign retailers to source 30% of their materials locally. Shares of Apple remained largely flat in pre-market trading Friday. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem.

Photographer: Chris Goodney/Bloomberg Alphabet Inc. warned investors about a slew of new competitors, highlighting the company's broad expansion beyond its original Google search business.  Alphabet named rivals including Apple Inc., Netflix Inc. and Hulu, while highlighting risks from new businesses such as consumer hardware manufacturing, according to its latest annual report filed Friday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Here are the top new competitive disclosures, gleaned from a comparison between Alphabet's latest annual report and the filing from a year earlier: Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up -- "Providers of digital video services, such as Facebook, Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu." Google's YouTube has new paid subscription versions of its online video offering that compete more directly with the latter three companies. Executives were cautiously optimistic about this on an earnings call last week. "[It] takes a while to build a subscription business here," Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said. -- "Digital assistant providers, such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft." Last year, the company launched its Google Assistant, a voice-based information service that Google hopes to embed in as many devices as possible. That competes against Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana. Facebook has a similar service in its Messenger app.  -- "Providers of enterprise cloud services, including Amazon and Microsoft." This refers to Google's cloud computing business, which executive Diane Greene is finally turning into a serious service for larger corporate customers. Alphabet mentioned the cloud in previous annual reports, but the focus on enterprise is new.  -- "Companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer electronics products." This likely refers to Google's new suite of gadgets, including the Pixel phone and Home speaker. The phone makes it a rival to Apple, and Android device makers like Samsung Electronics Co.  Speaking of hardware, Alphabet's latest annual report highlighted new manufacturing and supply-chain risks related to its in-house gadget push. "We may enter into long term contracts that commit us to significant terms and conditions of supply. We may be liable for material and product that is not consumed due to market acceptance, technological change, obsolescences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues," the company wrote.  Alphabet also disclosed the cost of marketing these new devices to potential buyers. Total sales and marketing expenses increased by more than $1.4 billion from 2015 to 2016 -- mainly due to a $679 million jump in advertising and promotional costs primarily for Google's hardware products, the filing said.  Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

And for markets and the economy, it was a busy one. Dozens of major corporate earnings were released, with highlights coming from Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), and Amazon (AMZN), while the week was capped with the January jobs report. In January, the economy added 227,000 jobs, more than forecast by economists. Wage gains, however, missed expectations. And while this was Trump’s first jobs report since being inaugurated two weeks ago, technically, he wasn’t president while the survey period took place. Next month, of course, the report will be all his. For better or worse. Looking out to next week, the economic calendar lightens up a bit, with the JOLTS report serving as the highlight alongside the preliminary reading on consumer confidence from the University of Michigan. View photos Lightning over Washington DC.More On the earnings front, we’ll get two reports from Dow members — Disney (DIS) and Coca-Cola (KO) — as we all as 84 S&P 500 companies, including Tyson Foods (TSN), Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA), General Motors (GM), Kellogg (K), and Nvidia (NVDA). Wednesday comes with Yahoo Finance’s All Markets Summit where you can catch speakers including Larry Fink, Jes Staley, Sallie Krawcheck, Abby Joseph Cohen, and Daymond John. The event will be streamed live on Finance.Yahoo.com. Economic Calendar Monday: No major economic data released. Tuesday: Trade balance, December (-$45 billion expected; -$45.2 billion previously); Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), December (5.588 million expected; 5.522 million previously); Consumer credit, December ($20 billion expected; $24.53 billion previously) Wednesday: MBA mortgage applications (-3.2% previously) Thursday: Initial jobless claims (250,000 expected; 246,000 previously) Friday: Import price index, January (+0.2% expected; +0.4% previously); University of Michigan consumer sentiment, February preliminary (97.8 expected; 98.5 previously) Earnings Fourth quarter earnings season is a bit more than halfway done. And so far, the biggest topic of discussion among S&P 500 executives hasn’t been President Donald Trump. Or at least, not directly. “The macro backdrop continued to be a major focus during [fourth quarter] earnings calls,” writes Lori Calvasina, an analyst at Credit Suisse. “Similar to prior quarters, FX/currency has been the most popular macro topic among S&P 500 companies. Not surprisingly, both the US election/politics and interest rates have seen a large increase in the number of companies mentioning these topics, while Brexit and commodity prices have seen a decline.” (Emphasis added.) View photos Source: Credit SuisseMore Of course, the currency markets are not unrelated to Trump, particularly given his views on trade and the various possibilities on tariffs or border adjustment taxes pursued by the administration to favor US-made goods over imports. But currency fluctuations are going to be of concern to most any company that does business overseas, and the US dollar’s rise (and the drop in commodity prices) over the last couple years has been behind much of the hit we’ve seen to corporate profits in recent years. “Foreign exchange is a bit of a problem for Apple and any U.S. company that has any business overseas,” Apple CFO Luca Maestri said. “The dollar is very strong.” Additionally, mentions of the US election and politics coming from 53% of S&P 500 companies is almost double the 28% rate we saw during third quarter earnings calls and up from about 5% a year ago. View photos Source: Credit SuisseMore Read More But that Trump isn’t completely dominating the conversations shows that while any new administration brings to markets considerable unknowns and risks, with the Trump administration stoking particularly acute anxieties about the future of trade, companies are still mostly focused on what impacts their bottom lines in the here and now. Last month, we saw US multinational giant Caterpillar temper enthusiasm on how Trump’s plans for corporate taxes and infrastructure spending could boost the company’s prospects. “Prospects for tax reform and an infrastructure spending bill in the United States are encouraging,” the company said in its fourth quarter earnings. “While these initiatives would likely be a solid positive for many of our businesses, we would not expect to begin to see meaningful effects of these changes until sometime in 2018.” Additionally, some recent analysis has sought to temper the enthusiasm around how Trump’s plans to cut corporate taxes would benefit US corporations over the long term. The math on why lower corporate taxes will aid bottom lines in the year after they are enacted is simple. The longer-run benefit, however, is less clear. Which brings us back to why, despite all of the talk about Trump on the news, on the streets, and certainly in the boardroom, US corporations are still focused, primarily, on currency moves. Or, more clearly, US corporations are focused on what will help or hurt their profits now, not down the road. Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Recently Viewed Your list is empty.

The series materialised in a thunderclap of notoriety, with considerable hubbub attending a stage-setting scene in which two middle-aged strangers enjoyed a steamy liaison in a House of Commons broom cupboard.  But this emphasis on novelty nookie was quickly dispensed with. Episode three offered further confirmation that, far from an upmarket Fifty Shades of Grey, the BBC has wrought a meticulously misanthropic psychodrama with devastating insights into the human capacity for self-destruction. Emily Watson and Adeel Akhtar Credit: BBC The most dazzling aspect of the Amanda Coe adaptation of Louise Doughty’s novel is that its twists genuinely arrive out of the blue. This was forcefully illustrated early in the third episode as a tender reconciliation/spontaneous snog between cheating wife Yvonne Carmichael (Emily Watson) and husband Gary – also cheating but sad and puppy-eyed about it – flipped in a heartbeat with police swooping in shortly afterwards to arrest her for murder. We’d had an inkling her mysterious paramour Mark Costley (Ben Chaplin) had done something terrible when Yvonne drove him around for a heart-to-heart with her rapist/stalker George Selway. After an ominous delay, Costley re-emerged shifty and pallid, the suave James Bond aura that had led Yvonne to tear his trousers off in that Westminster crypt suddenly absent.  Ben Chaplin as Mark Costley Credit: BBC Yet it had never crossed Yvonne’s mind that her mercurial beau would simply bludgeon to death the loathsome Selway. This was a man who could spot a fake CCTV camera at 50 paces and had gifted her a top of the range smartphone so that they could safely schedule their hook-ups. Murder seemed so crass and unbecoming. A second gut-punch came as the lovers were put on trial for conspiring to bump off Selway. Costley’s legal team pleaded diminished responsibility on the grounds of a “personality disorder” that rendered their client “mentally unstable” while an old boy from MI5 told the court that, though the accused had applied for a job at the intelligence agency, he hadn’t made it through the interview process. Far from copping off with a spook with license to thrill Yvonne had been in flagrante with a fantasist. There was, it is true, an occasional pungency Apple Tree Yard’s sombre gloss couldn’t quite obscure. Especially unconvincing was the relationship between Yvonne and Gary (Mark Bonnar), whose affair with a student was presented less as a betrayal than a new hobby he was trying out. Moreover, did Yvonne truly require a rom-com style sidekick in unlucky-in-love bestie Susannah (Susan Lynch)? Rhashan Stone as Robert Credit: BBC Yet Watson remained riveting as a woman struggling to hold together the seams of a life unspooling faster than she could process. And though Chaplin was barely in the episode, as the slouched Costley he searingly communicated the turmoil of a small man whose delusions had been exposed. Never mind the bonking – Apple Tree Yard is a cool-to-the-touch thriller that doubles as unnerving meditation on the dangerous urges just beneath the surface of everyday life. Tomorrow comes the final instalment as Yvonne and Costley’s case reaches its denouement. However things play out, expect the results to be considerably more shocking than a quickie in the closet.  Emily Watson's career in pictures Follow Telegraph Entertainment READ MORE ABOUT: Emily Watson Apple Tree Yard Westminster BBC Show more Editor's Choice 10 Feb 2017, 2:05pm Fifty Shades Darker review: An alleged 18-rated, adults-only filth-fest that behaves like a flustered PG 2 09 Feb 2017, 5:49pm Legion creator Noah Hawley on X-Men cameos and why his superhero series might drive you mad 06 Feb 2017, 12:01am The Royal Academy's epic Russian Revolution retrospective is more than just a history lesson – review  4 05 Feb 2017, 7:00am 'You’re a different person when you watch it': director Ang Lee on stretching the limits of cinema Premium 04 Feb 2017, 9:43pm How true is Taboo?

While recollections of notable Super Bowl ads from years gone by typically reference Apple's groundbreaking "1984" commercial, fewer mention the company's 1999 ad starring HAL, the malicious computer from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. "HAL" was Apple's first Super Bowl appearance since its 1985 "Lemmings" commercial and arrived amid a flurry of largely media-driven panic surrounding the Y2K bug, which was supposed to make computers go haywire when the millennium ticked over and bring about a precipitous collapse of global infrastructure. Macs on the other hand would be immune to the bug, thanks to their ability to recognize dates at least up to 29,940 – a fact not lost on Steve Jobs, who in 1999 had not long begun his second stint as Apple CEO. Over 12 months before the collective PC rollover from x99 to x00, Jobs decided he wanted to do a commercial that would promote the advantages of Mac ownership before worldwide calamity struck. So, Jobs tasked Ken Segall, then-Apple creative director at TBWA/Chiat/Day, to get the ball rolling and come up with an idea for an ad that would highlight the Mac's resistance to the Y2K bug. This week, Segall relayed detailed memories of making the "HAL" ad. In a blog post on his site, Segall relates his experiences of dealing with Jobs directly as the idea for the commercial took shape, and reveals how his team overcame legal, technical, and Steve-related challenges to make the commercial a reality – and a surprise Super Bowl hit. For an interesting read, check out Segall's full story here, and "HAL" below.

A Staff Writer While the report on Brand Finance’s website didn’t disclose the brand value of Tata in 2017, last year the brand was valued at $13.7 billion. Photo: Bloomberg The spat between Tata Sons and its former chairman Cyrus P. Mistry seems to have pushed Tata out of the top 100 brands in the world ranked by Brand Finance, a consulting firm. According to Brand Finance’s 2017 report, the Tata group has slipped out of the top 100 for the first time since 2007, the first year for which this data is available. In 2017, it is ranked 103 compared with 82 in the previous year. Tata, however, continues to be the most valuable brand in India ahead of Airtel, LIC, Infosys and State Bank of India, which all find a place in the global top 500. Reliance Industries, Indian Oil, HCL Technologies and Larsen & Toubro are also part of the global 500. Google was the top brand globally, followed by Apple and amazon.com. ALSO READ | Cyrus Mistry losing ground to Tata Sons, but legal battle far from over To be sure, the Tata brand had slipped in ranking well before the feud between Tata Sons and Cyrus Mistry. In 2016, it had slipped to rank 89 from 68 the previous year. Its brand value has also been coming down for the past couple of years. While the report on Brand Finance’s website didn’t disclose the brand value of Tata in 2017, last year the brand was valued at $13.7 billion. That was a decline from $15.4 billion in 2015. For comparison’s sake, the top global brand in 2016 (Apple) had a brand value of $145.9 billion. The Tata brand had a peak value of $18.1 billion in 2013. It was also part of the global top 50 for at least two years—2011 and 2012. Brand Finance calculated brand value by estimating the likely future sales that are attributable to a brand and calculating a royalty rate that would be charged for the use of the brand, i.e. what the owner would have to pay for the use of the brand—assuming it were not already owned. The boardroom battle at Tata Sons was sparked off by a 24 October putsch of Cyrus Mistry who was removed as chairman. The feud has reached the courts with the Cyrus Mistry family filing a case at the National Company Law Tribunal, alleging mismanagement of Tata Sons and oppression of minority shareholders. Tata Sons has used the importance of the Tata brand (which is licensed to Tata group companies) and signalled that it could pull these rights to rein in shareholders and directors in its bid to oust Mistry on various operating company boards. Group executives acknowledge that one of the first tasks for N. Chandrasekaran, the chairman designate of Tata Sons is to restore the brand image. In a 16 December interview with Mint, Harish Bhat, the new brand custodian of the Tata group said, “I would say this controversy perhaps has to some extent impacted the way some stakeholders look at the brand, and we will need to build on the brand and nurture it in the future, bearing that in mind.” A Staff Writer Topics: Tata Cyrus Mistry Tata brand brand rankings top 100 brands More From Livemint READ MORE Amazon warns that trade protectionism could hurt business AIADMK crisis: Sasikala seeks appointment with TN Governor to parade MLAs Manish Sisodia files RTI on Centre’s ad initiatives on social media First Published: Mon, Feb 06 2017. 12 30 AM IST Editor's Picks Infosys row seen as Narayana Murthy vs Vishal Sikka personality clash Govt appoints directors of 10 IIMs; G.

Welcome to the world of Onmyoji, or Yin Yang Master. It’s the latest craze in the field of collectible card, role-playing mobile games. Its register user base hit 200 million with 10 million daily active users globally, mainly from the Chinese mainland. Why else would about 200 young people have gathered recently on the coldest night of the winter in front of the Shanghai Fashion Center to attend an off-line event of Onmyoji, a game developed by China’s NetEase? The shivering enthusiasts were among the lucky “few” chosen from about the 10 million daily active Onmyoji players nationwide. The game pits players in combat against one another or against monsters, using powerful character cards, especially SSR (meaning “super super rare”) cards. “I really enjoy collecting the super super rare cards to establish my own team,” said Sabrina Jin, a financial firm worker who drove an hour to drive to attend the off-line event. Jin said she has spent almost 12,000 yuan (US$1,764) to collect three of the cards. She is not alone. Chinese consumers are spending more time and money on mobile games nowadays, thanks to improved plot lines and image quality, smartphone support for high-resolution displays, the addition of augmented reality elements, easy mobile payment and social network communities of players. Mobile games have become a hot trend in Chinese consumer spending, with players willing to fork over yuan for unique experiences in the virtual world. High-quality mobile games, like Onmyoji and the Young Three Kingdom Heroes developed by Shanghai-based Youzu, entice users to spend an aggregate of more than 10 million yuan or more a month, according to research firm International Data Corp. The in-app purchase of various items and game currencies can be paid for by just tapping iPhone’s Home button, thanks to Apple’s simplified payment process in China and improved fingerprint-recognition technology. Downloads on Apple’s China iOS mobile operating system surpassed those of the United States and Japan in 2016, ranking them top of the world for the first time. The increased volumes pushed iOS in-app purchase revenue in China to a record US$2 billion in the fourth quarter, according to the researcher App Annie. Cash cow Even without an English translation yet, Onmyoji is seeking inroads overseas. The game now offers localized versions in the application stores in Southeast Asia besides Hong Kong and Taiwan. It’s scheduled to debut new versions in Japan this Spring, as the further foreign expansion. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Onmyoji attracted more than 8 million downloads, earning NetEase over US$140 million in revenue in the Chinese iOS market of iPhone and iPad users, App Annie said in a reply statement to Shanghai Daily. Those figures don’t include Android smartphone players, who form an even bigger base than iPhone users in China. Still, in terms of the overall Chinese iOS market, Onmyoji ranked only third in the second half of last year, trailing Fantasy Westward Journey and Hero Moba, according to App Annie. With an emphasis on social game play and card collection, Onmyoji offers a story with a colorful background steeped in ancient Japanese legends. “It’s like establishing my own team, just as I do in the office,” said Jin, whose work colleagues also play the game. You don’t need deep pockets to enjoy all the fun. University student Tiffany Wu said she spends just 30 yuan a month on the game, opting for the cheapest paid package on offer. “It’s just like raising kids or pets,” said Wu, who shares her cards on WeChat. “I think of my game characters as sons and daughters.” Indeed, sharing “super super rare” cards on social networking platforms like WeChat and Weibo is very popular among players. Game publishers are certainly catering to the new generation of game players, said Chen Libiao, co-founder of the Shanghai-based game developer Youzu. Shenzhen-listed Youzu has generated revenue of more than 200 million yuan in the peak month through the game Young Three Kingdom Heroes, based on the Chinese history of the Three Kingdoms (220-265). Chinese game publishers are also establishing connections between virtual game worlds and the real world to boost brands, coverage and revenue finally. NetEase is interested in creating “virtual stars” in both games but in real life. The company organized the Shanghai off-line party with film stars in cosplay or wearing costumes representing specific characters. The event also included voting for the most popular characters, and music and dance performances related to the game. During the holiday period of New Year and Spring Festival, NetEase also gave game players the chance to win travel and restaurant vouchers. “We plan to connect the online and off-line gap of players’ feelings and experiences and let game characters appear in their daily lives,” said NetEase in a reply email. The top game character, Ubume Bird (Guhuoniao), received 35 million votes within days, including in-game votes and on-site votes at the Shanghai Fashion Center event. Youzu, which is planning a new chapter of the Young Three Kingdom Heroes, said it will integrate the game with other media, including film. The Three Kingdom stories are well known and beloved by most Chinese people. Players want to experience something different and have their own heroes, said Youzu, which cooperated with the Shanghai Film Group for a namesake film. The latest feature of Onmyoji relates to augmented reality, which allows users to “summon” character cards by scanning printed graphic patterns in the real world. A similar technology is used in the popular Pokemon Go, which created such a buzz in 2016.

Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies TV Politics Business Super Bowl Ads     Wearable Battery Charger Patented By Apple Posted: Feb 5 2017, 9:19am CST | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Apple     We have been subjected to countless rumors and gossips relating to Apple’s products all the time. The craziest one of these gossips fortunately is not rumor or a harbinger from tech gurus. In fact this move by Apple, none of us were expecting. Don't Miss: Exclusive Video Reports from the CES 2017 Show Floor US Patent and Trademark Office caused a stir around the globe when they published the article about Apple’s move to patent the charging apparatus for electronic wearables. Apple has moved to patent the idea of an inductive charger embedded in their smart wearable’ (Apple Watch) strap. The schematics of this implementation show a thin wire circulating with the strap, connected to a battery on one end while its other end connects to the watch. The graphical representations also present a very thin strap for the watch. No official word has been received from Apple yet, maybe because they still have not decided to go through to initiate research for this project. It also could be that Apple has simply patented the idea to ban any other company from using it, while they could take all their time to make it happen. Another indication that this may simply be a caution is that the geometric shape of the watch is circular instead of the actual rectangle. Maybe Apple did so to extend the restrictions through their patent or maybe they just presented a generic idea without accurately penning down everything. Though the response from the public clearly suggests that we would love Apple to go through and create the product that they have patented.

Nexus 6P vs Nexus 5X: The End of An EPIC Era... Vs Michael Grothaus 15:11, 5 Feb 2017 facebook twitter google+ Looking back at the excellent Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P – both of which now have Android Nougat! Android N is now available to ALL Nexus handsets, following its official unveiling at Google I/O 2016 alongside a bunch of other announcements which included HUGE updates to Google’s plans for the car industry, a new smart-home device called Google Home and a brand new VR platform called Daydream that will ship inside Android N. But Google’s Nexus phones are no more. They have now been replaced by the Google Pixel and the Google Pixel XL – two phones that are essentially Google’s version of the iPhone for the Android space. The decision by Google to nix its Nexus line and focus on selling premium, high-end phones designed within its HQ has been scrutinised to hell and back since the phones were first announced. I was skeptical too… but then I tested the Pixel XL out and it quite literally blew my mind. The handset has an amazing camera, brilliant performance and, best of all, perhaps the best battery life of ANY phone I have ever tested. Nothing can slow this handset down; heavy use yields a solid day and half, while more moderate usage will likely see things progress to two days. Standby is off the charts. Yes, these handsets are expensive. But so too is the iPhone, and this is the market – and consumers – Google is going after. It might take a few years for Google to catch up with Apple, but the quality of these Pixel handsets CANNOT be faulted. As phones they are easily two of the finest specimens ever produced by anyone in the mobile space. Still, if you want still want a Nexus you’re good to go, as the handsets are still available. We’ve even included some deals within this article for the best prices we found online. I still have a Nexus 6P and I still use it from time to time. It works great and will get support for Google for at least another 12 months and once that support runs out it will live on with custom ROMs, so, yes, the Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X, while no longer Google’s darlings, are still very much worthy of investment. For now though, let's have a look and see how Google's latest Nexus handsets compare. Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P: Specs Here’s the specs for the Nexus 5X: Display: 5.2 inches, FHD (1920 x 1080) LCD at 423 ppi Dimensions: 147.0 x 72.6 x 7.9 mm Weight: 136 grams Storage: 16GB or 32GB Memory: 2 GB LPDDR3 Processors: Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor, 1.8 GHz hexa-core 64-bit, Adreno 418 GPU Front camera: 5 MP, 1.4 µm pixels, f/2.0 aperture Rear camera: 12.3 MP, 1.55 µm pixels, f/2.0 aperture, 4K video Connectivity: Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac 2x2 MIMO, dual-band (2.4 GHz, 5.0 GHz); Bluetooth 4.2; NFC; GPS, GLONASS Colors: Carbon, Quartz, and Ice And here’s the specs for the Nexus 6P: Display: 5.7 inches; WQHD (2560 x 1440) AMOLED display at 518 ppi Dimensions: 159.3 X 77.8 X 7.3 mm Weight: 178 grams Storage: 32GB, 64 GB, or 128GB Memory: 3GB LPDDR4 Processors: Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor, 2.0 GHz Octa-core 64-bit; Adreno 430 GPU Front camera: 8MP camera; 1.4 µm pixels; f/2.4 aperture Rear camera: 12.3 MP; 1.55 µm pixels; f/2.0 aperture, 4K video Connectivity: Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac 2x2 MIMO, dual-band (2.4 GHz, 5.0 GHz); Bluetooth 4.2; NFC; GPS, GLONASS Colors: Aluminium, Graphite, Frost, and Gold (Japan only) There’s no question about it, the Nexus 6P is clearly the better of the two phones from an internal spec point of view. It packs the excellent Snapdragon 810 processor and Adreno 430 GPU along with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM. It also comes in three storage sizes starting with a respectable 32GB (hey Apple, take note) and includes 64GB and 128GB options. That’s not to say the Nexus 5X is a slouch–it’s a great upgrade over the Nexus 5, but it’s a less premium phone and it shows in comparison with the slower Snapdragon 808 processor and Adreno 418 GPU and only 2GB of LPDDR3 RAM. Plus it only comes in 16GB and 32GB storage options–and no one should buy a 16GB phone; it’s just not enough space. With specs Google has pretty much hit the nail on the head. It has everything you could possibly want and need on both variants but, unlike it did with the Nexus 6, Google has presented another option for consumers that are looking for more value for money. But how do the handsets' differ with respect to performance? Let's dig a little deeper with some analysis of benchmarks that compare the two handsets in question as well as the newer HTC 10 and Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE.  The Nexus 6P is the premium handset. It’s the one Google wants you to buy — the Nexus 6P is bigger, more expensive and decked out with better hardware. But what does this look like inside benchmarks? Is the gap as palpable as the price and marketing would have you believe? Let’s take a look. In Peacekeeper, which is a browser test, the handsets are very evenly matched. But when you consider both use Chrome as their stock web browser, this outcome isn’t surprising at all. This trend is also visible with the Galaxy S7 and HTC 10, which also use the same Android Marshmallow-version of Chrome. Where things start to get different is inside GFX, which puts the handsets’ through intensive graphics performance analysis with game-like content, low-level tests measure specific graphics performance aspects (Driver Overhead 2, ALU 2, Tessellation, Texturing). Here we see the additional grunt of the Nexus 6P paying dividends. Similarly, 2014’s Nexus 6 also puts in a fine performance compared to the newer Nexus 5X, which uses less RAM and the Snapdragon 808 CPU, versus more powerful Snapdragon’s and higher amounts of RAM inside the Nexus 6P. And if you’re interested in what the next-generation performance of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 looks like, simply look two rows down and have a butchers at the HTC 10 — it completely dominates everything in this list, including the Exynos-powered Galaxy S7 EDGE. Interestingly, the Nexus 6 really holds its own when compared to the Nexus 5X despite using an older SoC. What you’re seeing here is the power of having an extra GB of RAM at your disposal — the Nexus 6 has 3GB versus the Nexus 5X’s 2GB. In Geek Bench 3, which is designed to simulate real-world situations, it’s a similar picture: the Nexus 6P beats the Nexus 5X overall, followed by the Nexus 6. The HTC 10 and Galaxy S7 EDGE, on account of their improved processors and higher amounts of RAM, demonstrate their true next-generation status when compared to 2015 hardware with significant all round boosts to everyday tasks and overall performance.   Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P: Display Besides the internal specs, there's two other HUGE differences between the 5X and 6P. Let’s start with the most obvious: the display. The Nexus 5X has a 5.2 inch FHD LCD with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 at 423 ppi. The Nexus 6P, on the other hand, is clearly designed for those who want a phablet. It’s got a 5.7 inch WQHD AMOLED display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 at 518 ppi. Size differences aside, the display on the 6P is superior in every way: from its higher resolution WQHD AMOLED panel to its insane 518 pixels per inch. The 6P also features a Gorilla Glass 4 display, while the 5X uses the older, less durable, Gorilla Glass 3 display. Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P: Design The second major way the 5X and 6P differ is in their design. By now I’m sure you can tell that the 6P is designed to be the “premium” model of the two–it’s meant to take on high class phones like the iPhone 6s and the Samsung Galaxy S6. As a result it’s got a quality all-metal body that is sleek and sophisticated. That metal body also allows for the 6P to actually be thinner than the smaller 5X. The 6P is 7.3mm thick, while the 5X is 7.9mm thick. The 6P comes in four colors: Aluminium, Graphite, Frost, and Gold–though gold is only available in Japan. The reason the 5X is thicker than the 6P is because its body is made of smooth plastic. That won’t be a deal breaker for some, but for those that want the sleekest phone out there, metal bodies are where it’s at. The 5X comes in three colors: Carbon, Quartz, and Ice. Build materials and thickness aside, on the whole both devices are very similar in design and aesthetics, keeping that signature Nexus bodystyle with a smoothly rounded back panel and curvy corners. They're quite pleasant to look at, and little accents such as the Nexus 5X's round camera port and round fingerprint scanner side-by-side do have their charm. On the Nexus 6P, instead you have a large bar shape at the top housing the optics, and this does protrude slightly, while the round fingerprint scanner remains in the same place - while the Nexus 6P may be the more "premium" of the two in terms of build quality it has to be said the back panel is a little less elegant visually. Perhaps more important, though also more obvious, is the sheer size and mass of each device though. Of course we've covered this in the display size section to an extent, but it's also relevant in terms of design and handling properties - without wishing to state the bleeding obvious; the Nexus 6P is a MASSIVE 6in phone, so it's going to feel very different to operate and occupy more pocket space, and to be frank this is not everyone's cup of tea. If you have big hands you might be ok, but otherwise, expect a bit of unweildiness. The Nexus 5X, on the other hand (ha) is your typical 5in size and much more manageable for the average smartphone user. As usual, this comes down to personal preference and just what compromises you're prepared to make for the sake of better handling, or alternatively for things like, say, a massive but beautiful display, metal bodywork, and much better battery life. Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P: Cameras Surprisingly even though both phones have until this point been very different, they are exactly the same in the rear camera department. Both phones feature a 12.3 MP, 1.55 µm pixels, f/2.0 aperture rear camera that shoots 4K video. They both also have dual-LED flash and laser auto-focus. Where the phones differ is in the front camera. The 5X offers a 5 MP, 1.4 µm pixels, f/2.0 front lens, while the 6P bumps that up to a 8MP, 1.4 µm pixels, f/2.4 aperture front lens. However, all is not well in camp Nexus following reports of serious issues with the camera.  The glass seems to break for no apparent reason, and it’s not clear what caused the damage, according to one user on Reddit. “Well that was a surprise. For me, and the cat,” johny_rat wrote on Reddit. It was sat on a table next to me when I heard the glass snap, leaving a little snowfall of shavings on the table under it. It’s now continuing to crack away to itself.” “A different user said he reported the same problem to Google, which directed him to Huawei for future guidance,” notes BGR. “If this is a design issue, it’s likely all affected Nexus 6P will be repaired or replaced. Of course, for some people it might be difficult to prove the screen didn’t crack following an accidental drop.” Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P: Battery & Connectivity As far as connectivity, each phone features exactly the same innards: 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2, NFC, and a USB Type-C connector. The 5X has a smaller battery at 2,700 mAh versus the 6P’s 3,450 mAh battery, but that won’t necessarily translate to longer battery life in the 6P. After all, it’s got a much more power hungry display to run.  In our tests the Nexus 6P had very decent battery performance, even more so when you consider the handset runs a QHD panel. A lot of this is down to the sheer size of the battery cell, granted, but there is also Android Marshmallow’s role to factor; it has a bunch of new power saving features designed to not only extend the battery life of Android phones but also boost their idle performance by quite a considerable margin. Naturally with both phones being sealed unibody devices the battery cells are not removable in either device. The Nexus 6P is the better phone in all regards, including battery performance. In our tests we found the Nexus 6P to rank among the top five handsets of last year for battery performance — it really is that good. Testing battery life in a demonstrable manner is difficult because everybody uses phones differently. I might work a phone harder than, say, your Uncle Tim. But one way of showing how battery’s perform under pressure is through a video-playback test, whereby a video is looped until the phone dies. This is more of an endurance drain-test and, while not representative of everyday use, does give us a good idea of the battery’s overall performance when factor in with our anecdotal findings while roading testing the handset in the real world. And as you can see above, the results aren’t really all that surprising: the Nexus 6P beats the Nexus 5X by quite a margin and the newer HTC 10 and Galaxy S7 EDGE are WAY out in front. Largely, this uplift is down to better CPUs and more efficient software and power management. Still, the Nexus 6P isn’t bad by any stretch of the imagination. It’s just that this year’s phone makers REALLY upped their game with respect to battery life. And that’s something we can all appreciate. Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P: Price & Verdict The Nexus 5X is £339 for the 16GB model and £379 for the 32GB model. The Nexus 6P is £449 for the 32GB model, £499 for the 64GB version, and £579 for the128GB variant. But as usual, your choice probably won’t come down to price or even internal specs–it will come down to the display size. Do you want a big smartphone (if so, get the 5X) or a massive phablet (then the 6P is your guy). You can now pick up the Nexus 5X for next to nothing on Amazon.  That’s not to say the two phones are similar in other ways–they clearly are not. Spec for spec the 6P is better by a long shot in almost every way. But as I said, most of us buy based on display size–and if you’re like most of us (and you’re only deciding between these two phones) then their size is probably going to be the deciding factor for you.

Technology FANG+: Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet Break Formation Apple surged on earnings, Facebook wavered, Amazon and Alphabet sold off while Netflix chilled. (Apple) ED CARSON 2/05/2017 Reprints A week ago, the FANG+ stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Dow industrials component Apple (AAPL) — were in sync. All five had broken out in 2017, with all but Netflix still in buy range. But over the past week, Apple surged on earnings, Facebook wavered, Amazon and Alphabet lost key support, while Netflix chilled. Apple Apple is the top performing stock on the Dow Jones industrial average so far this year, up more than 11% so far. On Tuesday, Apple reported slim earnings per share and revenue gains for its holiday quarter, ending three quarters of year-over-year declines for both and topping forecasts. While investors are hoping that the upcoming iPhone 8 will be revolutionary, the current iPhone 7 still showed solid demand, while services revenue is growing quickly. Apple, which had been in a buy zone since clearing a 118.12 cup-with-handle entry point on Jan. 9, vaulted 6.1% on Wednesday to an 18-month high. RELATED: Apple Crushes Fiscal Q1 Estimates, Stock Jumps Late 5 Takeaways From Apple's 'Outstanding' Q1 Report Apple Music, Spotify Lead In Streaming Tunes, But It's Early Days IBD'S TAKE: Apple Music and Spotify are leaders in streaming music, but they face many smaller rivals, while Amazon and Alphabet are moving into this fast-growing but money-losing field. Facebook Facebook reported stellar earnings and revenue growth late Wednesday that easily beat forecasts, even though it was the second straight quarter of decelerating gains. The social network giant reiterated that ad revenue growth would slow meaningfully in 2017. But Facebook also said that expenses will rise sharply as it steps up already-brisk hiring and R&D. Facebook shares hit a record high on Thursday morning, but quickly reversed lower. However, the stock never undercut its 129.37 buy point, first cleared on Jan. 23. Amazon Amazon late Thursday reported better-than-expected earnings for the holiday quarter. But sales fell short, and the e-commerce giant's revenue outlook was soft as well. Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing unit that delivers the bulk of the company's profit, saw revenue rise 47%. But that was below views and down from Q3's 55% yearly gain. That could be a sign that the cloud computing wars with the likes of Microsoft (MSFT), IBM (IBM) and Alphabet — which got a cloud pact with Snap this week — are affecting AWS, which remains by far the industry leader. Amazon cleared a cup-with-handle buy point of 821.75 on Jan. 14. But on Friday, shares sank 3.5% to 810.20 in triple-normal volume. RELATED: Amazon Q4 Results Miss On Revenue, Beat On EPS; Stock Falls Netflix Netflix cleared a long cup-with-handle base on Jan. 4 with a 129.40 buy point. For the next several sessions, shares stayed close to the mark. On Jan. 19, shares gapped higher after reporting better-than-expected earnings and subscriber growth and bullish guidance that night before. Since then shares have consolidated, essentially kicking back and "Netflix and chill." Alphabet Alphabet didn't report earnings last week, but suffered an earnings-related sell-off. Alphabet reported earnings that fell short of views late on Jan. 26. Alphabet initially rose to a record high on Jan. 27, but reversed to close down in heavy volume. The selling continued this past week, sinking below its 824.40 buy point on Monday, again in heavy trade. Alphabet had broken out on Jan. 6, then moved sideways ramping up for a few days ahead of its earnings report. Alphabet has suffered a worrisome reversal. On the upside, Alphabet found support near its 50-day line.

The highly-anticipated Apple Tree Yard, adapted from Louise Doughty’s bestselling novel, launched on Sunday January 22. Array 6 Emily Watson stars in the new psychological drama, which is set in London The first episode certainly had an impact – with shocked viewers hitting out at a “harrowing” graphic rape scene. But who is in the cast and when will the episodes be on telly? When is Apple Tree Yard on TV? BBC’s new thriller series has been broadcast on BBC1 on Sundays at 9PM. However tonight’s finale airs at 9pm on BBC ONE. The four-part drama kicked off on January 22, but fans will be able to catch up on the season on BBC iPlayer. It will have to compete for viewers with Channel 4’s Homeland and ITV’s The Good Karma Hospital. What is the plot of Apple Tree Yard? Array 6 An affair turns Yvonne Carmichael’s life upside down Array 6 Her life soon starts to unravel when she gets involved with a married man A married woman with children starts a secret steamy affair with another man – but he’s also got a partner and kids. As character Yvonne Carmichael attempts to keep her philandering ways under wraps, her infidelity starts to catch up with her. Following a life-changing act of violence, her life is flung into the spotlight when she is accused of a brutal crime. Who is in the cast of Apple Tree Yard? Array 6 Ben Chaplin has taken on the role of Mark Costley, Emily Watson’s on-screen love interest Array 6 Joining Emily Watson will also be Mark Bonnar, Adeel Akhtar, Lydia Leonard, Frances Tomelty and Rhashan Stone The star of the TV mini-series is War Horse actress Emily Watson, who will play Yvonne Carmichael. English actor Ben Chaplin, who is known for his role in Mad Dogs, has taken up the role of love-interest Mark Costley. Also joining the all-star cast are Mark Bonnar, Adeel Akhtar, Lydia Leonard, Frances Tomelty and Rhashan Stone. Why is the show deemed controversial? The Sun’s Bizarre column has been given first access to some of the racy scenes in the upcoming Apple Tree Yard. Speaking about the racy sex scenes Emily Watson said: “The first thing I told the director was that I would not do nudity. “Not because I’m a prude, but I’m vain and way too old to be naked on screen” BBC 6 This adaptation of the Louise Doughty bestseller explores what happens when a married scientist makes one rash decision with a total stranger She added: “I have known Ben for a long time and we were very honest and straightforward about it. It was fun.” Seven minutes into the first episode viewers will witness the first passionate clinch between the two stars, additional scenes feature twice more throughout the episode. Is there a trailer for Apple Tree Yard? Trailer for new BBC drama Apple Tree Yard with Emily Watson and Ben Chaplin Fans have been sent into an excited frenzy over a teaser clip for the new BBC series. It shows Emily Watson’s character making her way across London before getting caught up in a raunchy affair with a married man. Following the secret relationship, character Yvonne can be seen being led away in handcuffs – but was she responsible for the grisly crime she was accused of?

That day is coming, sooner than you may think. Technology is already moving in this direction, and consumer marketers such as Samsung, Bose Corp., and Panasonic Corp. are reportedly readying new products of this kind. They’ll be sold over the counter, to customers who will test their own hearing with cell phone apps or online programs and adjust sound parameters themselves. The devices “will be widely used by older people,” just as earbuds are used by younger people today, predicted Richard Einhorn, a well-known composer who serves on the board of the Hearing Loss Association of America, a consumer group. Recognizing market forces, the Food and Drug Administration is mobilizing. In December, Dr. Robert Califf, the FDA’s commissioner, said the agency planned to take “steps necessary to propose to modify our regulations to create a category of [over-the-counter] hearing aids.” In January, the Federal Trade Commission announced plans for a major meeting on hearing health care in April. That agency played an important role in ensuring that consumers get copies of eyeglass prescriptions so they could shop around for good deals. For the most part, that doesn’t happen with hearing aids today. Whether agency priorities will change under the new Trump administration isn’t certain. But technology is developing rapidly under any circumstances. Older adults with mild to moderate hearing loss, including aging baby boomers, are expected to be a prime market for a new generation of products marrying hearing aid and consumer electronics hearable technologies. More than 40 percent of people over the age of 60 have some degree of hearing loss, mostly mild to moderate; that rises to 80 percent of people older than 80. Yet only 20 percent of those with some degree of impairment use hearing aids because of their high cost (an average $4,700 per pair), the lack of insurance coverage (traditional Medicare doesn’t pay for hearing aids), stigma, denial and difficulty navigating the hearing health system. Hoping to expand access, the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology came out in favor of low cost, over-the-counter hearing devices in October 2015. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine seconded that recommendation in a major report on hearing health care published in June. Both organizations cite a growing body of research linked hearing loss to cognitive decline, depression, the onset of dementia, falls, poor physical functioning and social isolation. The longer people delay seeking help, research suggests, the more at risk they become. Several recent developments are of note as consumer electronics companies, hearing aid manufacturers, audiologists, physicians, consumer advocates and regulators prepare for a surge of new hearing devices and changes in the hearing health care system: Removing Barriers For 40 years, the FDA has required that adults be examined by a doctor before purchasing a hearing aid or sign a waiver noting that they didn’t want to take this step. Last month, the agency eliminated that requirement for people over the age of 18. The National Academies of Sciences’ expert panel on hearing health had noted that the rule “provides no clinically meaningful benefit” and could discourage people from seeking care. Instead of seeing a physician, adults signed the waiver 60 to 95 percent of the time. Still, limits on access to hearing aids exist: All states restrict distribution of these devices to certified audiologists, physicians and device specialists. And some states still require medical evaluations. Proposed Legislation Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said last month that they would soon introduce new legislation endorsing over-the-counter hearing aids, sold without those restrictions. The goal is to increase competition, lower costs and expand access to devices for people with mild to moderate hearing loss, Grassley said in a prepared statement. Currently, six companies control nearly 98 percent of the hearing aid market in the U.S., contributing to high prices. Nearly two-thirds of people with severe hearing loss — many of them elderly — report being unable to afford the devices. The cost is generally “bundled” with professional fees for evaluation, fitting and follow-up care. Organizations representing hearing professionals are deeply divided. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, an organization representing audiologists and speech-language pathologists, doesn’t believe consumers can adequately self-diagnose hearing problems and opposes over-the-counter devices. The American Academy of Audiology, which represents more than 12,000 audiologists, believes professionals should evaluate hearing loss but is taking a “wait and see stance” until the FDA proposes a regulatory framework, its president, Ian Windmill, said. Another audiologist group, the Academy of Doctors of Audiology, believes the benefits of expanded access to hearing devices outweigh the risks and supports over-the-counter products. The senators plan to introduce their legislation, which asks the FDA to issue regulations ensuring the safety and effectiveness of these devices, in this new congressional session. “Administrations shift and legal challenges occur,” Grassley said in a statement, adding that getting the law on the books would ensure needed “certainty going forward.” Creating Standards One area of considerable confusion is the distinction between hearing aids and personal sound amplification products, known as PSAPs. This is a wide category of products, ranging from cheap devices that help amplify sound to sophisticated devices that resemble hearing aids in all but their name. In some cases, companies are marketing the exact same device as a hearing aid and a PSAP, sold at different prices. In 2009, the FDA drew a distinction between PSAPs and hearing aids based on their “intended use.” PSAPs were considered unregulated consumer electronics products for people with normal hearing who wanted to hear more sharply — for instance, during bird watching. Hearing aids were regulated and considered medical devices meant for people with hearing impairment. But technological advances have brought the two categories closer. And it’s well understood that people with hearing loss are using PSAPs as a cheaper alternative to hearing aids. Going forward, Stephanie Czuhajewski, executive director of the Academy of Doctors of Audiology, believes higher-end PSAPs will become over-the-counter hearing aids. In the meantime, the Consumer Technology Association has prepared standards for PSAPs meant to make it easier for consumers to understand what they’re buying. The standards, which address issues such as maximum output, peak output and sound distortion, and are under review at the American National Standards Institute and could be published as early as next month. “The intent is to provide a ‘Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval’ for PSAPs,” said Mead Killion, an audiologist who founded Etymotic Research, Inc., an Illinois company that manufactures hearing devices. Currently, there is no easy, standardized way to compare these devices.

With its second mobile title, the Japanese powerhouse is taking a different approach that is potentially more lucrative — and much more controversial. Fire Emblem, available on Thursday for Apple and Android devices in 39 countries, costs nothing to download and play, but lures users into spending money to unlock special in-game items. The technique is called “gacha” in Japanese and it has all the controversy the English reading of the word implies. It’s extraordinarily profitable in Japan — but even there it has raised concerns from regulators who say it can be addictive and manipulates people’s gambling spirit, or shako-shin in Japanese. Nintendo shares jumped as much as 5.9 per cent on Friday as the game rose to No. 4 in Japan's iOS revenue rankings after its release, according to researcher Sensor Tower. Partner DeNA soared as much as 7.9 per cent. Nintendo is well aware of the controversy. The late President Satoru Iwata objected to the gacha business model used by many of his competitors in 2012, saying it cannot be the basis for “long-lasting relationship with our customers.” That approach was consistent with the Kyoto-based company's corporate image: It's the game industry's answer to Walt Disney, marketing family friendly characters like Mario and steering clear of the thugs and assassins so popular elsewhere. Yet over the years, Nintendo’s ethical resolve has been whittled away by investors pushing for more success in the fast-growing smartphone market. After a lacklustre December debut for Super Mario Run, its first mobile game, the company is changing gears and adopting techniques that have been so profitable for rivals like CyberAgent and Mixi. "Nintendo opened Pandora's box," said Serkan Toto, founder of Tokyo-based consultant Kantan Games Inc. ``The gacha mechanic in Fire Emblem seems to be a key element and vital to progression by players, just like in many other mobile hits from Japan.'' Gacha is the most prized of the dark arts that Japanese gamemakers have used to make their country the most lucrative mobile gaming market per user in the world. There are variations called ``event gacha'' and ``consecutive gacha,'' but the basic idea is that players are asked to spend money without knowing what they're buying ahead of time, unlike in the popular games of the West. In Fire Emblem Heroes, as the mobile version is officially known, players can win orbs through battles or buy them, with prices for sets of orbs ranging from $1.99 to $74.99. They're used to unlock hundreds of characters for a user's party, but the catch is users don't know ahead of time who they'll get. Sometimes it's a new character, other times a less-valued duplicate. Compare that with Clash Royale, a popular game made by Finnish developer Supercell Oy. That title also has hints of gacha but money is mostly used to eliminate wait times — a clearer payoff. “In the West, gacha is often an add-on right now whereas in Japan, the mechanic is so important that developers need to carefully design and introduce gacha machines to keep the balance in their games,'' said Toto. If that makes gacha sound like gambling, that’s because in many ways it is. The word gacha — not to be confused with ’gotcha’ — is the sound Japanese vending machines make when dispensing toy capsules, whose contents can’t be seen prior to a purchase. In mobile games the practice has drawn ire in Japan, where five years ago the government banned a technique called ``complete gacha'' and any approach that manipulates shako-shin. That puts Nintendo in a precarious position. Super Mario Run didn’t use gacha to give parents a “peace of mind that kids can play it,” as President Tatsumi Kimishima told Bloomberg News in October. But the game still angered many fans who said the $10 price-tag for higher levels was too expensive — and it disappointed financial analysts who said it didn’t make enough money. Still, Toto doesn't think Fire Emblem will provoke outrage because its appeal is likely more limited than Super Mario Run or Pokemon Go. The game, based on a franchise that dates back to the 1990s, is ``very Japanese,'' says Toto. That means foreign players unfamiliar with the nation's game culture may be turned off by a dialog-heavy gameplay and anime-style characters. Investors may not mind too much because, with the gacha business model, what matters is not the number of players but how much each spends. In Japan, studies have shown less than 10 percent of players account for more than 90 per cent of revenue. Nintendo's strategy in Japan is likely to focus on these so-called ``whales,'' selling them Fire Emblem's nostalgic content wrapped in a gacha package. In the West, potential for success is less clear. Some popular gacha titles like Granblue Fantasy are already available in English, but few have replicated the success they see in Japan or matched the popularity or profitability of Western games like Candy Crush. If Nintendo can pull it off, it would be a first. Either way, it's a sign the company will be aggressive in trying to generate revenue from mobile. “I was surprised to see Nintendo using a traditional gacha mechanic with their first free-to-play game ,'' he said. < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The tech wizards — with hoards of cash cozily sitting in off-shore tax havens — had their say in the run-up to and the aftermath of the presidential election. Over the past several years, hacking and cybercrimes have skyrocketed. In fact, it has gotten to the point where there have been hacks against the US government, corporate America and, of course, political campaigns. Last week, Apple, Facebook and Amazon reported strong growth and incredible earnings power. Google reported a $5.3 billion quarterly profit two weeks ago. It’s time for the titans of tech to step up and make their product environment more secure. Because it seems they do it for themselves. If banks were to get hacked, it would be on the hook to you, the depositor. When a credit card gets hacked or stolen and is used online to purchase items, it is the credit card company that is on the hook. Both banks and credit card companies are insured for these types of things, and they purchase the insurance at a cost to them. They are extraordinarily and properly watchful over transactions that look fraudulent — in fact, it’s usually your card company that alerts you that somebody has been illicitly using your card before you even have a chance to notice. That’s how good they are. Additionally, when Google, Amazon and Apple all reported their earnings, there were no catastrophic losses from hacking. Amazon is essentially the world’s largest online shopping mall yet, miraculously, it is seemingly impenetrable. Same with Apple’s iTunes platform. And ditto for Google, eBay and PayPal. However, customers using Gmail or iTunes or other accounts have had their info stolen and their credit cards used elsewhere. And it’s always on the banks and credit card companies to make the customer whole — despite the fact that it was the provider’s technology that was breached in the first place. Should Google not be on the hook for an e-mail scam that costs its users millions? Or Apple for iTunes letting credit card data be swiped? Why is it the bank’s fault when an e-mail phishing scam via Google is the culprit? I actually do understand why: Silicon Valley has some talented lobbyists and they donate a tremendous amount of money — far more than many realize. Do you ever wonder why we don’t ever see the hacked private e-mails of Apple’s Tim Cook or Google’s Larry Page? Clearly they have very advanced technical capabilities to protect their own assets. It’s time they protect the rest of us the same way.
