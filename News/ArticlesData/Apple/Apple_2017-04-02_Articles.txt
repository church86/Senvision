We shared a few possible fixes for owners to try when the 13-inch MacBook Pro keyboard and mouse become unresponsive and now Apple is acknowledging the problem with a short-term fix and the promise of an update to address the cause. In a new knowledge base article Apple offers a one-minute fix for an unresponsive trackpad and touchpad, and plans an update, but does not offer an estimated release for the issue. Read: 13-inch MacBook Pro Retina Haswell Benchmarks Users who experience the freezing mouse and keyboard on the MacBook Pro Retina 13-inch late 2013 model do not need to go to an Apple Store or send their new notebook in for repair, so this looks like a software issue. If the MacBook Pro Retina freezes while you are working on something, putting the computer to sleep for a minute will fix the issue. Simply close the lid of the MacBook Pro Retina and wait 60 seconds. When you open the lid the touchpad and keyboard should be reset and working. In one week of usage we’ve run into the unresponsive touchpad and keyboard once, while in the middle of writing an article. Closing the lid allowed us to use the notebook again without losing any progress. In our experience closing the lid for just 10 seconds was enough to trigger the reset and get us back to work. This is not a good permanent fix, especially if the freeze happens while on a video call or during another tim sensitive moment, so Apple is working on a fix. The company offers the following information, “Apple is aware of rare circumstances where the built-in keyboard and Multi-Touch trackpad may become unresponsive on 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display (Late 2013) computers and is working on an update to resolve this behavior.” Apple experienced issues with the new MacBook Air WiFi soon after its release and pushed an update out over the Mac App Store, which is where we expect to see this update arrive. The new 13-inch Macbook Pro Retina late 2013 model uses new Intel 4th generation ‘Haswell’ processors which include enhanced integrated graphics and are able to deliver better battery life than earlier models. Watch the 2013 Macbook Pro Retina Unboxing and Demo below. 18 Responses 10/31/2013 Scott Reply I have had this happen TWICE within 4 days. Maybe I am an outlier but that doesn’t seem “rare” to me. This is my first Mac, and want to love it, but this hang up may prevent me from being able to. 11/03/2013 Songpol Siengvisuth Reply You are still fortunate. This freaking issue happens to me EVERYDAY and more than one time a day! 10/31/2013 Oscar Reply This has happened to me three times… TODAY! pretty annoying. 10/31/2013 Jase Reply Could they still be using the old usb3/haswell c1 stepping which is widely reported during launch? 11/01/2013 david Reply ive had this mac for 3 days and its happened 3 times, though I do expect Apple will fix it soon (ish) 11/03/2013 xyz Reply If “rare” equals a frequency of 3 times within 1 hour, I don’t want to know what “occasional” means in Apple terms…this is more than pretty annoying IMHO. 11/03/2013 David Beaton Reply Has happened to me 4 times in past week (since purchase). For me this was a very expensive investment and the issue of freezing has more than taken the gloss of the purchase. Apple need a fix quickly or mine is going back. 11/03/2013 Kyle Reply It’s happening to me right now. I’m on a tight deadline and closing the computer does not seem to be working. Any other suggestions??? 11/03/2013 Kyle Reply …left comment on another computer… files in progress on frozen mac 11/03/2013 Andy Reply I just bought mine two days ago. The first day was fine. Then today it froze twice within a 45 minute span. 11/04/2013 TigerStar Reply It happens to me every day at least three times a day. Usually when I am doing something dumb like reading the news or facebook. 11/04/2013 Kernith Reply misery loves company…. mine too 11/04/2013 Nathan Reply This has happened to me at least 5 times since I first got it. I was in the middle of a complex trade when it froze just recently [IN FACT IT JUST HAPPENED AS I WAS WRITING THIS POST] Not so rare…..I hope this is a mission critical issue with Apple by now. 11/07/2013 jeff Reply Happens to me once a day or so. Note that there’s a very easy temporary fix: just connect something by USB. E.g. a USB drive, your iPhone, an external mouse. Anything. This will prevent the problem from happening. 11/08/2013 Bob Reply Check software updates. It looks like Apple has released a firmware update to address this problem. 11/23/2013 Azure Reply I’ve had this happen quite often, but today, after closing the laptop to “fix” the problem, when I reopened the laptop, the screen was black (like I had shut it down) and did not respond when I clicked the mouse, keys and even the power button. I closed it for a bit, reopened it, had a screen up, but still an unresponsive mouse, and after repeating this process several times, I eventually forced shutdown and restarted a few minutes later. This is EXTREMELY alarming. Has anyone else had this problem? 12/14/2013 bewilder Reply Mine (13″ retina 16GB ram) froze upon connecting iPhone and opening iTunes … putting it to sleep after didn’t help. I had to do a forced shutdown …. not happy at all with that. I cannot afford it to freeze like that as I plan to use for live performance. My gf’s 3 year old 13″ pro never had any issues like that … go figure. If it happens again I will simply return it. 04/02/2017 Greg Reply Hello from 2017! Three and a half years later, I’m still waiting for that fix, and putting the computer to sleep for a minute doesn’t cut it. Try six to ten hours. Occasionally, plugging in a USB mouse or keyboard lets me regain some control, but usually it doesn’t, and I don’t always have something like that on hand. My software is all up to date, I’ve reset my PRAM, checked my connections, and replaced a chip on the motherboard, to no avail. (At this point I’m inclined to agree it’s a software issue.)

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Review: 3SIXT Bluetooth Studio Earbuds Anthony Caruana 3 April, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments Reviews With the advent of the iPhone 7, wireless headphones have taken up a new level of importance in the Apple universe. Many people are questioning whether investing in a wired headset, replete with Apple’s proprietary Lightning connector, is the best option or whether Bluetooth headphones are a more flexible option. 3SIXT (three-sixty in case you missed the reference) makes some great Apple accessories such as cases and headphones. Their Bluetooth Studio Earbuds have an interesting design and deliver good sound. The connect via Bluetooth 4.1. Initial setup was straightforward – Bluetooth has certainly come a long way. Pairing is initiated the first time the Studio Earbuds are activated or by holding the central button on the inline controller for a few seconds. The two ear-pieces are magnetic and stick to each other. When separated, the headphones turn on automatically. Reconnect them and they power off. Or they automatically go into stand-by mode when not used for three minutes. Battery life is rated at several hours with charging via a micro-USB cable. If you enable the Batteries widget on your iPhone, the Studio Earbuds will report their battery level there so you can keep track of when you need to recharge. The charging port is hidden under a rubber cover and a small door that I found difficult to open without using something to pry it open. It’s a small annoyance but one that got on my nerves a little. The two buds are joined by a thin cable that has an inline controller for play/pause control, volume up and down, and answering calls through the integrated microphone. The Studio Earbuds weigh just 16g. they come with five sets of rubber tips of varying sizes in order to fit most different ear canals. All those and the USB charging cable fit in a small solid pouch for carrying the earbuds when they are not in use. I paired the Studio Earbuds with two devices: my iPhone 7 Plus and Apple Watch Series 2. Sound quality was pretty good but I did find they lacked solid bass response. One of the playlists I loaded to my Apple Watch was some workout music. This is mainly rock music and I found it sounded a little too thin for my liking. In contrast, the same music through the iPhone 7 Plus was far more to my liking suggesting Apple needs to do some work on music output from the Apple Watch. 3SIXT claims the Bluetooth Studio Earbuds use “CVC6.0 noise-cancellation technology”. This is a suite of algorithms for acoustic echo cancellation and noise suppression. I did not find the noise cancellation to be particularly effective. For example, I could hear my fingers tapping on the keyboard while working and wearing the headphones. Low pitched ambient sounds were also audible unless I bumped the volume up. One of the main uses of wireless headphones is for exercising. I found it very hard to get the Studio Earbuds to stay in place when moving around. It only took a few seconds of running in place or a couple of Jumping Jacks for the buds to fall out. Although they aren’t touted as being specifically designed for use during exercise this is something worth considering. Macworld Australia’s buying advice: At under $80, the 3SIXT Bluetooth Studio Earbuds represent great value. They are easy to use, offer great sound quality – assuming your output device pumps out the sound at a reasonable level – and are comfortable.

Four banks — Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, National Australia Bank and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank — wanted to negotiate with Apple to gain access to its payments technology used in “Apple Pay” for their own apps, avoiding having to pay fees to Apple, the BBC reported on Friday. The banks do not allow their cards to be used with “Apple Pay” because they never reached agreement on the conditions. By collectively bargaining with the Cupertino-headquartered tech giant, these four banks wanted to convey to Apple that unless it gave them access to its iPhone technology, they would continue to prevent their customers from using Apple Pay. In its final ruling on Friday, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said that the collective threat to boycott Apple was “likely to reduce or distort competition”. The commission said that ruling in favour of the banks would have reduced competition by forcing Apple to act more like Google, whose more open Android operating system allows contactless payments from individual apps. “It is a tricky issue for a competition regulator to force one competitor to adopt a strategy of the other competitor,” ACCC chairman Rod Sims was quoted as saying. Meanwhile, the banks have said that they were “disappointed” by the decision and would review their future strategies. The near field communication (NFC) system used in “Apple Pay” allows users to transact by just holding their phone to a small terminal, with the money deducted from a bank card registered with Apple Pay.

Join For Free Learn how to troubleshoot and diagnose some of the most common performance issues in Java today. Brought to you in partnership with AppDynamics. “No provision need be made for the user to program the return of registers to the free-storage list.” This line (along with the dozen or so that followed it) is buried in the middle of John McCarthy’s landmark paper, “Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine,” published in 1960. It is the first known description of automated memory management. In specifying how to manage memory in Lisp, McCarthy was able to exclude explicit memory management. Thus, McCarthy relieved developers of the tedium of manual memory management. What makes this story truly amazing is that these few words inspired others to incorporate some form of automated memory management—otherwise known as garbage collection (GC)—into more than three-quarters of the more widely used languages and runtimes developed since then. This list includes the two most popular platforms, Java’s Virtual Machine (JVM) and .NET’s Common Language Runtime (CLR), as well as the up and coming Go Lang by Google. GC exists not just on big iron but on mobile platforms such as Android’s Dalvik, Android Runtime, and Apple’s Swift. You can even find GC running in your web browser as well as on hardware devices such as SSDs. Let’s explore some of the reasons why the industry prefers automated over manual memory management. Automatic Memory Management’s Humble Beginnings So, how did McCarthy devise automated memory management? First, the Lisp engine decomposed Lisp expressions into sub-expressions, and each S-expression was stored in a single word node in a linked list. The nodes were allocated from a free list, but they didn’t have to be returned to the free list until it was empty. Once the free list was empty, the runtime traced through the linked list and marked all reachable nodes. Next, it scanned through the buffer containing all nodes, and returned unmarked nodes to the free list. With the free-list refilled, the application would continue on. Today, this is known as a single-space, in-place, tracing garbage collection. The implementation was quite rudimentary: it only had to deal with an acyclic-directed graph where all nodes were exactly the same size. Only a single thread ran, and that thread either executed application code or the garbage collector. In contrast, today’s collectors in the JVM must cope with a directed graph with cycles and nodes that are not uniformly sized. The JVM is multi-threaded, running on multi-core CPUs, possibly multi-socketed motherboards. Consequently, today’s implementations are far more complex—to the point GC experts struggle to predict performance in any given situation. Slow Going: Garbage Collection Pause Time When the Lisp garbage collector ran, the application stalled. In the initial versions of Lisp it was common for the collector to take 30 to 40 percent of the CPU cycles. On 1960s hardware this could cause the application stall, in what is known as a stop-the-world pause, for several minutes. The benefit was that allocation had barely any impact on application throughput (the amount of useful work done). This implementation highlighted the constant battle between pause time and impact on application throughput that persists to this day. In general, the better the pause time characteristic of the collector, the more impact it has on application throughput. The current implementations in Java all come with pause time/overhead costs. The parallel collections come with long pause times and low overheads, while the mostly concurrent collectors have shorter pause times and consume more computing resources (both memory and CPU). The goal of any GC implementer is to maximize the minimum amount of processor time that mutator threads are guaranteed to receive, a concept known as minimum mutator utilization (MMU). Even so, current GC overheads can run well under 5 percent, versus the 15 to 20 percent overhead you will experience in a typical C++ application. So why you don’t feel this overhead like you do in a Java application? Because the overhead is evenly spread throughout the C/C++ run time, it is perceptibly invisible to the end users. In fact, the biggest complaint about managed memory is that it pauses your application at unpredictable times for an unpredictable amount of time. Garbage Collection Advancements Sun Java’s initial garbage collector did nothing to improve the image of garbage collection. Its single-threaded, single-spaced implementation stalled applications for long periods of time and created a significant drag on allocation rates. It wasn’t until Java 2, when a generational memory pool scheme—along with parallel, mostly concurrent and incremental collectors—was introduced. While these collectors offered improved pause time characteristics, pause times continue to be problematic. Moreover, these implementations are so complex that it’s unlikely most developers have the experience necessary to tune them. To further complicate the picture, IBM, Azul, and RedHat have one or more of their own garbage collectors—each with their own histories, advantages, and quirks. In addition, a number of companies including SAP, Twitter, Google, Alibaba, and others have their own internal JVM teams with modified versions of the Garbage collectors. Costs and Benefits of Modern-Day Garbage Collection Over time, an addition of alternate and more complex allocation paths led to huge improvements in the allocation overhead picture. For example, a fast-path allocation in the JVM is now approximately 30 times faster than a typical allocation in C/C++. The complication: Only data that can pass an escape analysis test is eligible for fast-path allocation. (Fortunately, the vast majority of our data passes this test and benefits from this alternate allocation path.) Another advantage is in the reduced costs and simplified cost models that come with evacuating collectors. In this scheme, the collector copies live data to another memory pool. Thus, there is no cost to recover short-lived data. This isn’t an invitation to allocate ad nauseam, because there is a cost for each allocation and high allocation rates trigger more frequent GC activity and accumulate extra copy costs. While evacuating collectors helps make GC more efficient and predictable, there are still significant resource costs. That leads us to memory. Memory management demands that you retain at least five times more memory than manual memory management needs. There are times the developer knows for certain that data should be freed. In those cases, it is cheaper to explicitly free rather than have a collector reason through the decision. It was these costs that originally caused Apple to choose manual memory management for Objective-C. In Swift, Apple chose to use reference counting. They added annotations for weak and owned references to help the collector cope with circular references. There are other intangible or difficult-to-measure costs that can be attributed to design decisions in the runtime. For example, the loss of control over memory layouts can result in application performance being dominated by L2 cache misses and cache line densities. The performance hit in these cases can easily exceed a factor of 10:1. One of the challenges for future implementers is to allow for better control of memory layouts. Looking back at how poorly GC performed when first introduced into Lisp and the long and often frustrating road to its current state, it’s hard to imagine why anyone building a runtime would want to use managed memory. But consider that if you manually manage memory, you need access to the underlying reference system—and that means the language needs added syntax to manipulate memory pointers. Languages that rely on managed memory consistently lack the syntax needed to manage pointers because of the memory consistency guarantee. That guarantee states that all pointers will point where they should without dangling (null) pointers waiting to blow up the runtime, if you should happen to step on them. The runtime can’t make this guarantee if developers are allowed to directly create and manipulate pointers. As an added bonus, removing them from the language removes indirection, one of the more difficult concepts for developers to master. Quite often bugs are a result of a developer engaged in the mental gymnastics required to juggle a multitude of competing concerns and getting it wrong. If this mix contains reasoning through application logic, along with manual memory management and different memory access modes, bugs likely appear in the code. In fact, bugs in systems that rely on manual memory management are among the most serious and largest source of security holes in our systems today. To prevent these types of bugs the developer always has to ask, “Do I still have a viable reference to this data that prevents me from freeing it?” Often the answer to this question is, “I don’t know.” If a reference to that data was passed to another component in the system, it’s almost impossible to know if memory can safely be freed. As we all know too well, pointer bugs will lead to data corruption or, in the best case, a SIGSEGV. Removing pointers from the picture tends to yield a code that is more readable and easier to reason through and maintain. GC knows when it can reclaim memory. This attribute allows projects to safely consume third-party components, something that rarely happens in languages with manual memory management. Conclusion At its best, memory management can be described as a tedious bookkeeping task. If memory management can be crossed off the to-do list, then developers tend to be more productive and produce far fewer bugs. We have also seen that GC is not a panacea as it comes with its own set of problems. But thankfully the march toward better implementations continues. Go Lang’s new collector uses a combination of reference counting and tracing to reduce overheads and minimize pause times. Azul claims to have solved the GC pause problem by driving pause times down dramatically. Oracle and IBM keep working on collectors that they claim are better suited for very large heaps that contain significant amounts of data. RedHat has entered the fray with Shenandoah, a collector that aims to completely eliminate pause times from the run time. Meanwhile, Twitter, and Google continue to improve the existing collectors so they continue to be competitive to the newer collectors.

The question is, who will earn the lion’s share, German banks or Apple? By Elisabeth Atzler and Katharina Schneider Published on 03. April 2017, 05:47 Why it matters Why it matters Germans are still remarkably wedded to the idea of paying in cash and banks will not find it easy to persuade them to use their mobile phones for transactions instead. Facts Facts Near-field communication (NFC) is used in contactless payment systems using smartphones. Apple allows only partial access to the NFC interfaces of its devices to keep users within its ecosystem. 67 percent of those Germans asked on the ECC survey said they felt paying from a mobile device would only be worth it, if there was a universal system that all customers can use and is accepted by all retail outlets. Audio Audio LISTEN Pdf Contactless payment heading to Germany. Source: Bloomberg Deutsche Bank will this week begin letting customers pay with their MasterCard using an App and their Android smartphones, amid reports that Apple Pay is about to enter the market. If it does, it will engage in a power struggle with German banks for the greatest asset of the banks – contact to their customers. So far, Deutsche Bank’s mobile app only works with  Google’s operating system Android and the first step of its mobile payment service will only reach the 300,000 bank customers with a MasterCard, Handelsblatt has learnt. Apple has not yet confirmed it will enter the German market but there are plenty of signs that  it is preparing to do just that. In February Apple released guidelines for Apple Pay in the German language on the internet. The introduction of Apple Pay poses a problem for German banks, because the business of paying with mobile devices is something they would rather handle themselves, and Apple represents a technical hurdle to these plans. Mobile operating systems use a NFC: the standard for wireless transmission of data over short distances, from smartphone to the POS terminal. Google offers free access to the Android NFC interface but Apple reserves it for its own payment systems. In other worlds, unless they cooperate with Apple Pay, German banks cannot offer iphone users the ability to pay through their mobiles. After a consortium of banks in Australia attempted to get Apple to drop its NFC access restrictions and lost, it is unlikely that German financial institutions will have better cards trying here. Voluntarily opening up this NFC interface on Apple devices simply does not benefit the company. “Apple acts according to the motto ‘engulf or die’ and wants to keep customers within its own ecosystem.” said Maik Klotz, a consultant on payment systems.   “When customers use their bank’s app to pay for something, they look at their checking account balance, and read what is being offered by the bank via the app.” Oliver Hommel, Accenture Apple also demands a major part of the fees that are charged for paying with your mobile device. But in Germany, the allowed fees for this are pretty small and usually go to the banks, since they are the ones who issue credit and debit cards consigned to Apple Pay. “Apple Pay is looking for a strong partner in Germany. The catch is, that Apple also wants to earn from this – a kind of fee from the transactions. German credit institutions, however, are used to receiving this fee when they allow payment.” Horst Rüter, EHI Retail Institute. German consumers are still far more wedded to paying cash than other Europeans, who have been quicker to embrace contactless payments. Nonetheless, German banks are working on their own solution for payment via smartphone in the hope that it will lead to better engagement with their customers. “When customers use their bank’s app to pay for something, they look at their checking account balance, and read what is being offered by the bank via the app,” said Oliver Hommel, expert for bank transactions at the consulting company Accenture. This strengthen ties to the customers and also reduces cash costs. Mobile payment is also  seen as the technology of the future and German banks do not want to be overtaken again by third parties. German savings banks and credit unions are also trying to crack the mobile payments market. Joachim Schmaltz, Digital Board Member of the German Savings Bank Association recently said that German savings banks are aiming to have customer credit cards on their smartphones by the fourth quarter of this year. Debit cards will follow in 2018. Apple Pay is not the only player on the market. China’s Alipay – offered by Ant Financial – is more popular in some cities than paying with cash is currently available in Germany as well. It’s focus so far has been on Chinese tourists here, but this could well change.   Elisabeth Atzler has been a banking correspondent of Handelsblatt since 2012.

But it says a lot about some of the wealthiest and most powerful businesses in the country that they felt the need to get help from the regulator. Lots of ink and pixels have been and will be spilt over this decision. Is it right that Apple should block banks for accessing the NFC radio in their phones? Does Apple's large market share in Australia (over 45%) factor in? Should a collective of the most powerful corporate citizens be able to work together to force a market outcome? Does Apple's track record for offshoring their cash in order to minimise their tax payments matter? All are interesting and emotive questions. But I think the big issue is that the banks have had many years to get their act together over mobile payments. They have tried with some half-arsed attempts involving crappy stickers but they have not invested in any serious way. Apple Pay is a software invention that combines biometric security, a Secure Element chip and an NFC radio. It only works because of the wide adoption of the EMV standard for contactless payments - something the banks have invested in and reaped the benefit of with all the tap-and-go cards we now hold. The failure of the banks to get their own payment app working isn't Apple's fault. It's a failure to invest in the right technology. And, in my view seeking help from a market regulator is the equivalent of your favourite sports team asking for the game's administrators to let them get access to the opposition's best players because they can't score as well as the other team. All our large banks report massive profits each quarter. And at every turn they charge customers fees and maintain high interest rates on credit cards in order to protect those profits for their shareholders. But that "protect the profit" attitude has resulted in a failure to invest in the right technology. The payments industry is ripe for fintech startups. If we've learned anything from the application of blockchain in the evolution of cryptocurrency and the development of Android Pay, Samsung Pay and Apple Pay, it's that the real innovations in payments are not coming from established players in the finance business. The stoush between Apple and the Australian banks is important as it represents the start of banks losing their grip over a piece of the market they believed was untouchable. And the ACCC's decision should be an encouragement to innovators looking to disrupt a market that is in desperate need for change.

It's a failure to invest in the right technology. Ease up on the fanboyism. Whilst I'm in no way on the bank's side on this one, how did they fail to invest in the right technology? They've been pushing NFC payments on Android for years before Apple finally came to the party. Personally I think it's more about them continuing to justify the money they've poured into their existing mobile apps. Otherwise they would all have adopted Android Pay (which doesn't charge an additional fee). I'd much rather use an embedded solution (Apple Pay/Android Pay) over the sub-par tap and pay solutions of the bank's, but on the other hand it would also be nice for the NFC chip to be open to use by other apps on iOS for marketing/auto sign in/instant Bluetooth and WiFi connect/etc purposes. Reply 0 anthonyp69 @anthonyp69 Apr 3, 2017, 3:16pm I do think the ACCC is wrong on this. Allowing Apple to restrict access to the NFC communications will not open up third party payment apps. It puts all the control in Apple's hands. Without this comms you cannot build a 3rd party payment system that will use existing technology at the check out. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

Apple doesn’t seem to be having any luck in getting anywhere near its long-rumored TV service, so it might be settling for the next best thing instead. According to the usual sources familiar with the matter, Cupertino is planning on offering HBO, Showtime, and Starz in a single-price bundle, instead of the piecemeal channels it already has available. Whether or not this plan will pan out, however, largely depends on whether Apple is finally able to convince TV networks to do what it wants this time. Unlike in the music industry, Apple’s clout hasn’t been big enough to get TV networks on the same page. Even just bundling pay TV channels has been a no-go for the company, to the point that it has publicly stated it has given up even trying. Network giants are just too big to make concessions, at least for Apple. For other companies like Sony, AT&T, or even Google, that apparently isn’t much of a problem. Apple’s last resort might to just offer a bundling of its apps instead. It already sells Time Warner’s HBO, CBS’ Showtime, and Lionsgate’s Starz individually, ranging from $9 to $15 a month. Offering those three up as a bundle, not unlike how it bundles some apps together, could be simpler than a more comprehensive pay TV offering. That said, it’s not yet a sure deal, as Apple has still to get the approval of the networks before it can do anything. Unless its luck has finally changed, it might be looking at another dead end. Granted, Apple already does sell these already although separately. Networks might prefer to keep it that way. Another still unsettled issue is the price. Collectively, the three channels cost $35 a month and a bundle will have to go considerably lower to make it even worth the hassle. That, of course, might mean that networks will get a much smaller split of the revenue and Apple will have to work even harder to make up for that loss by exponentially increasing the number of subscribers.

Ten years ago, laptop sales overtook desktop PC sales to become the dominant hardware platform for computing. Now smartphones are about to do to laptops what laptops did to desktops. But wait, you may ask. What's wrong with laptops? Apple has run out of good laptop ideas For the past decade, Apple has led and dominated the laptop market with design and innovation. The company has been moving toward better quality, so-called "Retina" screens. Apple’s keyboard designs and unibody aluminum construction have been heavily imitated. The company used to dazzle the industry by sweating the small stuff, like the MagSafe power connector and lights that shine through aluminum. It's not just that Apple innovated. It's that its laptop innovations evolved their products toward elegance and usability. And that's over. After years without a significant new laptop design, their latest release, last year's MacBook Pro, landed with a thud. The laptop was seriously underpowered — called by some a MacBook Air at a MacBook Pro price. The company ditched its incredibly popular MagSafe power connector in favor of USB C power. And that Touch Bar! Some like it, others hate it. Either way, the innovation turns away from elegance and simplicity toward awkward interface design and complexity. Most reviewers and users either hate the Touch Bar or like the Touch Bar, but few love it. The keyboard is a mixed bag. Its short key travel thrills some and annoys others. And the touchpad is way too big. Users report constant accidental taps. Apple's attempt to be more elegant and minimalist has had the opposite effect. By offering only four USB C ports, the laptop itself has become simpler. But USB C requires the user to buy ugly, awkward, easy-to-lose dongles and adapters for all those devices and media we use that don't support USB C. Yuck! The best thing that can be said about the MacBook Pro is that it's faster and has a better screen than previous models. But this is inevitable and expected, not revolutionary. There's nothing about this laptop that's going to drive the industry to imitate. Rivals are more likely to see the new MacBook Pro as an opportunity to provide something different, not something similar. Most importantly, is the MacBook Pro worth the price? We'll get to that question in a minute. But first, let's look at all the trends happening this year that conspire against the laptop in general. Flying the unfriendly skies The U.S. and U.K. governments recently banned all non-medical electronic devices larger than a smartphone as carry-on for U.S.-bound flights on specific airlines from specific airports in the Middle East and North Africa. Passengers are required to check their laptops. The ban may have been implemented in response to two recent laptop bomb explosions — one blowing a hole in an airplane flying from from Somalia to Djibouti and the other wounding six people in a Somali airport. These events coincided with intelligence chatter finding increasing sophistication by Al Qaida in building laptop bombs. One congressman said at a recent security conference that more countries would be joining the ban. There are several assumptions we can make about the ban. First, like so many security measures, the ban may spread globally and eventually include all flights. For the next few years, it may become impossible to use a laptop on a commercial flight. Second, such a ban will affect laptop sales. Many travelers won't want to place an expensive laptop in checked luggage for fear of loss or theft. The general fear, uncertainty and doubt around laptops on airplanes is enough to change consumer behavior. And the frequent flier is the laptop industry's best customer base. Third, the ban will be an incentive to develop alternatives so passengers can travel without laptops. Wait, what alternatives? The docking smartphone alternative Samsung announced this week its upcoming Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones, and the public is impressed. But even more impressive is a Galaxy S8 peripheral called the DeX Station. The DeX is a smartphone dock into which you plug a keyboard, mouse and monitor. DeX enables you to use your Galaxy S8 as a desktop PC. (Instead of a monitor, you can also plug in a TV or projector.) The dock outputs at a 4K resolution, and it supports Ethernet for faster connections. I expect some of you business users to buy two — one permanently installed in your office and another in your home office. That would enable you to use your smartphone full time as your only device, even as you benefit from the giant screen, full-size keyboard goodness of a desktop PC everywhere you work. You can take it with you on trips, and use it in hotel rooms to plug into the room's big TV. Years ago, the use of a phone as a desktop PC wasn't practical. But now, thanks to the cloud and the emergence of strong, even enterprise-capable apps for Android phones, a smartphone docking setup makes perfect sense. The DeX Station costs $149.99 and ships in late April, according to Samsung. At that price, you still can get a bigger screen and better keyboard than what you get on a laptop, and at a fraction of the price — even if you have to go out and buy a monitor, keyboard and mouse. It's possible that even Apple may get into the docking racket. Apple last week published a patent application for a clamshell laptop-like device that runs off an iPhone. The iPhone is inserted in the same spot in front of the keyboard where the touchpad now sits on a MacBook Pro. The phone not only powers the device entirely, but you use the iPhone's screen as the touchpad. This would give you the laptop experience without the laptop price. Better still, you'd use iOS instead of OS X, and could use a single device for everything. You can bet that if Samsung and Apple are enabling the use of smartphones instead of desktops or laptops, the rest of the industry will do so as well. In fact, a small company called Andromium, which makes the Andromium OS (an app that gives Android the look and feel of a desktop OS) is offering for pre-order something called the Superbook. It's a $129 laptop-looking "shell," that's powered by an Android phone. I think the practice of docking in general, and docking a smartphone in particular, will go mainstream fast. The smartphone-size laptop alternative Docking isn't a new idea — even docking a smartphone isn't new (consider Microsoft's Continuum, for example). What's likely new is the embrace of docking as a mainstream alternative. Here's another old idea that's about to go mainstream: clamshell smartphones. In 1997, a company called Psion perfected the so-called personal digital assistant, or PDA. Psion did this through amazing industrial design. The Psion Series 5 had a surprisingly large and touch-typeable keyboard. Sadly, this perfection was washed away by the rising mobile phone movement, which replaced PDAs. Now, the same designer who created the Psion Series 5, Martin Riddiford, is re-creating it as a dual-boot Android and Linux smartphone called the Gemini PDA. He's designing it for a company called Planet Computers. Planet Computers The Gemini PDA is a clamshell Android phone that you can use instead of a laptop. While closed, the Gemini PDA can be used as a phone. While open, it can be used as an Android smartphone with a built-in keyboard — or a Linux laptop that fits in your pocket. In fact, the smartphone-size PC idea is emerging more generally, including in the gaming space. Even Apple has a patent for a clamshell iPhone, which uses a bendable screen. If users want a physical, touch-typeable keyboard, in other words, they won't need a laptop to get one. 3 more trends fatal to laptops All these alternatives provide incentives to use smartphones instead of laptops. And there are three more trends — the last of which will close the lid on laptops once and for all. The first fatal trend is that young people are already choosing smartphones over laptops, even without docking and clamshell smartphones. ComScore reports that the use of laptops and desktops among younger people is on the decline. Some 20 percent of millennials use their smartphone as their only computing device, according to a recent report, and this percentage grows each year. Raw demographics alone favor the end of laptops. The second fatal trend is that the industry is champing at the bit to move everything off Intel and onto ARM. (Intel and Intel-compatible chips have powered desktop and laptop platforms for decades; the smartphones and smartphone apps run on ARM chips.) Once laptops, especially laptops from Apple, run ARM chips, they'll run iOS and Android instead of OS X and Windows. And at that point, they'll essentially be identical to docking solutions, but more expensive. The third and final fatal trend can be found in your wallet. Smartphones are becoming amazing. The Galaxy S8 is amazing. And this year's iPhone is expected to be mind-blowing as well. The new phones have cameras that rival DSLRs. They have performance that rivals desktop PCs. They run increasingly amazing apps, including professional-quality apps. Unlike laptops, smartphones are exciting. And they're expensive. Consumers are now ready to pay $700, $800 — even $1,000 and upwards for a phone. (Already a top-of-the-line iPhone 7 with AppleCare costs $1,100. The iPhone 8 is expected to be more expensive.) Consumers will pay this amount because smartphones are worth it. This is especially true if they don't have to shell out $1,500 or more for a laptop as well. Laptops are too boring and expensive. The industry is churning out new designs that enable smartphones as laptop replacements. Young people are favoring smartphones. The industry wants to use smartphone OSes. And consumers are spending more on smartphones, which will make us spend less on laptops. The dominance of laptops is over. You may never buy another laptop. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Credit: Concepts-iPhone Credit: Concepts-iPhoneMore A Barclays research note provided to Apple Insider suggests that the iPhone 8 will offer a True Tone display, the same type of screen found on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. The iPhone 8 will apparently accomplish this through "full spectral ambient light sensors," which will change the color of the screens based on the color and brightness of ambient light. MORE: iPhone 8 Leak Reveals Surprising Design, New Name According to Apple, the four-channel ambient light sensors in the iPad Pro automatically adapt the color and intensity of the display to match the light in your environment. This is designed to make reading more comfortable and closer to a book-like experience.Credit: Apple Credit: AppleMore Such a feature is important, because OLED displays tend to deliver over-saturated hues, so an iPhone 8 will OLED that could dynamically control its color temperature would give the device an edge over the Galaxy S8. The research note also says that True Tone technology is coming to the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus, so apparently those phones just won't be refreshed on the inside.

The reports are claiming that this was done as Toshiba had lost its US nuclear unit Westinghouse, which filed for bankruptcy protection, and to help make up for the loss of that business, Toshiba will be selling off its storage business to potentially offset any losses. Now according to a report from The Korea Herald, a couple of high profile tech companies are said to be bidding on the business, which includes Apple and Google. SK Hynix was also said to be making a bid for the company, but apparently with Apple and Google throwing their names into the hat, the report claims that SK Hynix’s chances of winning the bid have been lowered. As it stands Apple is a customer of Toshiba who supplies the company with NAND flash storage for its products, and if Apple were to acquire the company it would basically mean that Apple will no longer have to rely on third-party companies to supply their components, or to be more specific, Apple might have to rely much less on the likes of Samsung for their mobile NAND components. It is said that Toshiba’s NAND chips account for about 20% of the NAND market which is a pretty hefty chunk, so not only would Apple benefit from being able to supply themselves, but they could have another potential revenue stream in which these NAND chips could be supplied to other companies.

Bank of America will also make a donation for every Apple Pay transaction using its cards, also up to $1 million. Customers around the world can also easily donate directly to (RED) through iTunes. In the US, iTunes Movies is offering a free download of The Lazarus Effect, the documentary about the mission of (RED).

Over the past 10 years, 70 million lives have been impacted by (RED)-supported Global Fund grants. At the start of Apple’s partnership with (RED), 1,200 babies were born with HIV every day, and today, UNAIDS predicts that number could be near zero by the year 2020, with the end of AIDS by 2030. With the life-saving medication costing as little as 30 cents a day, every person can make a difference. Through these efforts we’ll get that much closer to helping (RED) create an AIDS-free generation.

Their renewable energy projects will produce over 12 MW of solar power — more than the energy they need for Apple manufacturing — and support Japan’s nationwide efforts to limit its carbon emissions. “These innovative new clean energy investments demonstrate our commitment to doing business responsibly and economically,” said Kyoichi Yamanaka, Managing Director of Ibiden’s Environment Group. “Our products help Apple devices run smarter, and now we’re powering our operations with smarter energy too. We’re pleased to partner with Apple and lead the way in helping Japan meet its clean energy goals.” Apple and its suppliers will be generating over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy for the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018 — equal to taking over 400,000 cars off the road for a year. Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 percent of its operations in 23 countries, and more than 93 percent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

If you do, you may or may not already know that Apple offers their users the option of subscribing to those channels individually. However it seems that soon Apple could offer them up in a single bundle. This is according to a report from Recode who claims that Apple has approached the companies about the idea, where their Apple TV or iOS users could subscribe to all three of them at once. This is almost similar to models offered by traditional pay TV operators, but the difference is that this bundle will be sold as a standalone product, whereas TV operators typically require users to at least subscribe to basic level of TV channels first. It is unclear if the bundle would be priced cheaper than if you were to subscribe to them individually, where HBO costs $15, Showtime at $11, and Starz at $9 a month, but presumably it would be otherwise what would be the point of the bundle, unless Apple has some other freebies or perks thrown in, right? The report from Recode claims that Apple has yet to finalize a deal with any of these networks yet, so for all we know it may never materialize, but basically the idea is that this is something that Apple is exploring.

That's how often I use an Apple TV. I have three at home, and one of them always comes with me on vacations. As I type this, my TV is displaying one of those amazing Aerial screen savers (of the Great Wall of China, by the way). I use Apple TV all of the time; that's how I know it needs to get better. Apple TV is an interesting product in Apple's line-up. For much of its lifespan, it was considered a "hobby." That's Apple CEO Tim's Cook's word. Though Apple execs never marketed the device as strongly as they do iPhones and Macs, personally, I was sold the moment iOS supported AirPlay for Apple TV. [ Related: Video review: Apple's new AirPods ] Sure, every major platform ecosystem now has the capability to stream images and video to another device hooked up to a TV, but the ability to do so on the Apple TV debuted almost seven years ago. For me, AirPlay has always the best way to easily display movies and photos on an HDTV, and it was the only way to get iTunes content onto a TV. The integration with other Apple products through AirPlay has been an important feature check for those in the Apple ecosystem. Whenever I considered the alternatives, -- everything from Google Chromecast to Roku and the Amazon Fire Stick -- the fact that I stored my content in iTunes and the convenience of AirPlay gave Apple TV the edge. Software updates, yes. But... As of now, the Apple TV hardware hasn't been updated in 520-plus days and counting. The current model arrived in October 2015. Usually, I'm not concerned about the length of time between updates. Apple has a solid history of supporting its hardware lines with consistent software updates. Case in point: An update for Apple TV arrived on Monday, eliminating the "scrolling through long lists" issue I would have complained about. So it's not as if Apple has abandoned its hobby, like so many Android devices that won't see any updates long before their usefulness is over. Despite a dearth of hardware updates, new features, security updates, and bug fixes continue to trickle in for Apple TV. But there are some things software can't fix, and Apple under Cook seems to have but one priority when it comes to regular hardware updates -- the lucrative iPhone line. Given the revenue the iPhone brings in, this makes sense. But when you consider other products like the Mac Pro -- which hasn't been updated now in three years -- and the Mac mini, the question becomes: What's going on here? To be blunt, I'm concerned that Apple TV is a core product that is being ignored in an era of increased competition from smaller and cheaper alternatives. The iPhone -- the "corest" of Apple products -- is safe from being outgunned by competition because every resource at Apple is dedicated to it. The Mac notebook and iMac lines are beholden to Intel's processor launch schedules, but remain more or less competitive with similarly-specced PCs. But the Mac Pro and Mac mini continue to languish. I don't want the same thing to happen to the Apple TV. It's easy to second-guess Apple's strategy, especially since the public isn't privy to the data corporate decisions are based on. Yet that doesn't change the fact that the Apple TV -- for all of the software updates it's received -- needs major hardware updates if Apple wants to keep the device competitive. It's time for 4K The Apple TV needs 4K support, as soon as possible. I understand why a 4K model hasn't been rushed to market -- mainly because 1080p high-definition is the sweet spot for most TVs. Meeting the demands of most users is a financially sound decision. It's a safe decision. Certainly, the processors capable of decoding 4K video would have eaten into profit margins, or forced higher Apple TV prices. But remember when Apple used to be the forward-thinking company? Okay, maybe that's a tad inflammatory. In many cases, Apple products are (or at one point were) market leaders in forward-thinking. Think about the original iPod, iTunes, the first iPhone and iPads. Or the latest MacBook Pros, and the shift to USB-C ports. Going all in on USB-C was a very 'Bondi Blue iMac' decision by Apple. But I'm concerned about the Apple TV. 4K isn't an inevitable future possibility, it's happening now, in more and more households as potential cord cutters look for viable solutions. Embracing 4K lets current 4K TV owners in the Apple ecosystem use their TVs as God intended, and it gives developers a higher resolution canvas to design for. And in case you haven't noticed, 4K TV sales are soaring as prices plummet. Thankfully, the arrival of 4K on the Apple TV seems to be coming soon. But that's not the only thing needed. ...And gaming? This may be a stretch, but why not ship the Apple TV with game controllers? It doesn't have to be complicated; even something as simple as ancient SNES controllers would work. If Apple were to leverage its position and ship game controllers with the next Apple TV, it would give developers consistent hardware standards to write games around. Right now there are third-party options for controllers -- as well as the capability to use an iPhone as a game controller -- but that's not enough. If Apple wants its Apple TV to be a Trojan horse into the living room, the company needs to give buyers (and developers) something to cheer about. An Apple TV that's also a gaming machine could be a major differentiation from competing devices, and it would allow Apple to attract users who might not want to pay PS4 and Xbox money for gaming. Gaming could and should be treated as part of the next Apple TV's core functionality. There's been much talk over the years about Apple's desire to revolutionize the living room TV with Apple TV, but that hasn't yet happened. An Apple TV revamp doesn't need to reinvent the wheel to gain a bigger foothold; it just has to do what it does now, at higher resolutions and -- if Apple needs to justify a higher starting price -- offer real gaming support. So what's it going to be Apple -- stick with the hobby or get serious? ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Ten years ago, laptop sales overtook desktop PC sales to become the dominant hardware platform for computing. Now smartphones are about to do to laptops what laptops did to desktops. But wait, you may ask. What's wrong with laptops? Apple has run out of good laptop ideas For the past decade, Apple has led and dominated the laptop market with design and innovation. The company has been moving toward better quality, so-called "Retina" screens. Apple’s keyboard designs and unibody aluminum construction have been heavily imitated. The company used to dazzle the industry by sweating the small stuff, like the MagSafe power connector and lights that shine through aluminum. It's not just that Apple innovated. It's that its laptop innovations evolved their products toward elegance and usability. And that's over. After years without a significant new laptop design, their latest release, last year's MacBook Pro, landed with a thud. The laptop was seriously underpowered — called by some a MacBook Air at a MacBook Pro price. The company ditched its incredibly popular MagSafe power connector in favor of USB C power. And that Touch Bar! Some like it, others hate it. Either way, the innovation turns away from elegance and simplicity toward awkward interface design and complexity. Most reviewers and users either hate the Touch Bar or like the Touch Bar, but few love it. The keyboard is a mixed bag. Its short key travel thrills some and annoys others. And the touchpad is way too big. Users report constant accidental taps. Apple's attempt to be more elegant and minimalist has had the opposite effect. By offering only four USB C ports, the laptop itself has become simpler. But USB C requires the user to buy ugly, awkward, easy-to-lose dongles and adapters for all those devices and media we use that don't support USB C. Yuck! The best thing that can be said about the MacBook Pro is that it's faster and has a better screen than previous models. But this is inevitable and expected, not revolutionary. There's nothing about this laptop that's going to drive the industry to imitate. Rivals are more likely to see the new MacBook Pro as an opportunity to provide something different, not something similar. Most importantly, is the MacBook Pro worth the price? We'll get to that question in a minute. But first, let's look at all the trends happening this year that conspire against the laptop in general. Flying the unfriendly skies The U.S. and U.K. governments recently banned all non-medical electronic devices larger than a smartphone as carry-on for U.S.-bound flights on specific airlines from specific airports in the Middle East and North Africa. Passengers are required to check their laptops. The ban may have been implemented in response to two recent laptop bomb explosions — one blowing a hole in an airplane flying from from Somalia to Djibouti and the other wounding six people in a Somali airport. These events coincided with intelligence chatter finding increasing sophistication by Al Qaida in building laptop bombs. One congressman said at a recent security conference that more countries would be joining the ban. There are several assumptions we can make about the ban. First, like so many security measures, the ban may spread globally and eventually include all flights. For the next few years, it may become impossible to use a laptop on a commercial flight. Second, such a ban will affect laptop sales. Many travelers won't want to place an expensive laptop in checked luggage for fear of loss or theft. The general fear, uncertainty and doubt around laptops on airplanes is enough to change consumer behavior. And the frequent flier is the laptop industry's best customer base. Third, the ban will be an incentive to develop alternatives so passengers can travel without laptops. Wait, what alternatives? The docking smartphone alternative Samsung announced this week its upcoming Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones, and the public is impressed. But even more impressive is a Galaxy S8 peripheral called the DeX Station. The DeX is a smartphone dock into which you plug a keyboard, mouse and monitor. DeX enables you to use your Galaxy S8 as a desktop PC. (Instead of a monitor, you can also plug in a TV or projector.) The dock outputs at a 4K resolution, and it supports Ethernet for faster connections. I expect some of you business users to buy two — one permanently installed in your office and another in your home office. That would enable you to use your smartphone full time as your only device, even as you benefit from the giant screen, full-size keyboard goodness of a desktop PC everywhere you work. You can take it with you on trips, and use it in hotel rooms to plug into the room's big TV. Years ago, the use of a phone as a desktop PC wasn't practical. But now, thanks to the cloud and the emergence of strong, even enterprise-capable apps for Android phones, a smartphone docking setup makes perfect sense. The DeX Station costs $149.99 and ships in late April, according to Samsung. At that price, you still can get a bigger screen and better keyboard than what you get on a laptop, and at a fraction of the price — even if you have to go out and buy a monitor, keyboard and mouse. It's possible that even Apple may get into the docking racket. Apple last week published a patent application for a clamshell laptop-like device that runs off an iPhone. The iPhone is inserted in the same spot in front of the keyboard where the touchpad now sits on a MacBook Pro. The phone not only powers the device entirely, but you use the iPhone's screen as the touchpad. This would give you the laptop experience without the laptop price. Better still, you'd use iOS instead of OS X, and could use a single device for everything. You can bet that if Samsung and Apple are enabling the use of smartphones instead of desktops or laptops, the rest of the industry will do so as well. In fact, a small company called Andromium, which makes the Andromium OS (an app that gives Android the look and feel of a desktop OS) is offering for pre-order something called the Superbook. It's a $129 laptop-looking "shell," that's powered by an Android phone. I think the practice of docking in general, and docking a smartphone in particular, will go mainstream fast. The smartphone-size laptop alternative Docking isn't a new idea — even docking a smartphone isn't new (consider Microsoft's Continuum, for example). What's likely new is the embrace of docking as a mainstream alternative. Here's another old idea that's about to go mainstream: clamshell smartphones. In 1997, a company called Psion perfected the so-called personal digital assistant, or PDA. Psion did this through amazing industrial design. The Psion Series 5 had a surprisingly large and touch-typeable keyboard. Sadly, this perfection was washed away by the rising mobile phone movement, which replaced PDAs. Now, the same designer who created the Psion Series 5, Martin Riddiford, is re-creating it as a dual-boot Android and Linux smartphone called the Gemini PDA. He's designing it for a company called Planet Computers. Planet Computers The Gemini PDA is a clamshell Android phone that you can use instead of a laptop. While closed, the Gemini PDA can be used as a phone. While open, it can be used as an Android smartphone with a built-in keyboard — or a Linux laptop that fits in your pocket. In fact, the smartphone-size PC idea is emerging more generally, including in the gaming space. Even Apple has a patent for a clamshell iPhone, which uses a bendable screen. If users want a physical, touch-typeable keyboard, in other words, they won't need a laptop to get one. 3 more trends fatal to laptops All these alternatives provide incentives to use smartphones instead of laptops. And there are three more trends — the last of which will close the lid on laptops once and for all. The first fatal trend is that young people are already choosing smartphones over laptops, even without docking and clamshell smartphones. ComScore reports that the use of laptops and desktops among younger people is on the decline. Some 20 percent of millennials use their smartphone as their only computing device, according to a recent report, and this percentage grows each year. Raw demographics alone favor the end of laptops. The second fatal trend is that the industry is champing at the bit to move everything off Intel and onto ARM. (Intel and Intel-compatible chips have powered desktop and laptop platforms for decades; the smartphones and smartphone apps run on ARM chips.) Once laptops, especially laptops from Apple, run ARM chips, they'll run iOS and Android instead of OS X and Windows. And at that point, they'll essentially be identical to docking solutions, but more expensive. The third and final fatal trend can be found in your wallet. Smartphones are becoming amazing. The Galaxy S8 is amazing. And this year's iPhone is expected to be mind-blowing as well. The new phones have cameras that rival DSLRs. They have performance that rivals desktop PCs. They run increasingly amazing apps, including professional-quality apps. Unlike laptops, smartphones are exciting. And they're expensive. Consumers are now ready to pay $700, $800 — even $1,000 and upwards for a phone. (Already a top-of-the-line iPhone 7 with AppleCare costs $1,100. The iPhone 8 is expected to be more expensive.) Consumers will pay this amount because smartphones are worth it. This is especially true if they don't have to shell out $1,500 or more for a laptop as well. Laptops are too boring and expensive. The industry is churning out new designs that enable smartphones as laptop replacements. Young people are favoring smartphones. The industry wants to use smartphone OSes. And consumers are spending more on smartphones, which will make us spend less on laptops. The dominance of laptops is over. You may never buy another laptop.

That's how often I use an Apple TV. I have three at home, and one of them always comes with me on vacations. As I type this, my TV is displaying one of those amazing Aerial screen savers (of the Great Wall of China, by the way). I use Apple TV all of the time; that's how I know it needs to get better. Apple TV is an interesting product in Apple's line-up. For much of its lifespan, it was considered a "hobby." That's Apple CEO Tim's Cook's word. Though Apple execs never marketed the device as strongly as they do iPhones and Macs, personally, I was sold the moment iOS supported AirPlay for Apple TV. [ Related: Video review: Apple's new AirPods ] Sure, every major platform ecosystem now has the capability to stream images and video to another device hooked up to a TV, but the ability to do so on the Apple TV debuted almost seven years ago. For me, AirPlay has always the best way to easily display movies and photos on an HDTV, and it was the only way to get iTunes content onto a TV. The integration with other Apple products through AirPlay has been an important feature check for those in the Apple ecosystem. Whenever I considered the alternatives, -- everything from Google Chromecast to Roku and the Amazon Fire Stick -- the fact that I stored my content in iTunes and the convenience of AirPlay gave Apple TV the edge. Software updates, yes. But... As of now, the Apple TV hardware hasn't been updated in 520-plus days and counting. The current model arrived in October 2015. Usually, I'm not concerned about the length of time between updates. Apple has a solid history of supporting its hardware lines with consistent software updates. Case in point: An update for Apple TV arrived on Monday, eliminating the "scrolling through long lists" issue I would have complained about. So it's not as if Apple has abandoned its hobby, like so many Android devices that won't see any updates long before their usefulness is over. Despite a dearth of hardware updates, new features, security updates, and bug fixes continue to trickle in for Apple TV. But there are some things software can't fix, and Apple under Cook seems to have but one priority when it comes to regular hardware updates -- the lucrative iPhone line. Given the revenue the iPhone brings in, this makes sense. But when you consider other products like the Mac Pro -- which hasn't been updated now in three years -- and the Mac mini, the question becomes: What's going on here? To be blunt, I'm concerned that Apple TV is a core product that is being ignored in an era of increased competition from smaller and cheaper alternatives. The iPhone -- the "corest" of Apple products -- is safe from being outgunned by competition because every resource at Apple is dedicated to it. The Mac notebook and iMac lines are beholden to Intel's processor launch schedules, but remain more or less competitive with similarly-specced PCs. But the Mac Pro and Mac mini continue to languish. I don't want the same thing to happen to the Apple TV. It's easy to second-guess Apple's strategy, especially since the public isn't privy to the data corporate decisions are based on. Yet that doesn't change the fact that the Apple TV -- for all of the software updates it's received -- needs major hardware updates if Apple wants to keep the device competitive. It's time for 4K The Apple TV needs 4K support, as soon as possible. I understand why a 4K model hasn't been rushed to market -- mainly because 1080p high-definition is the sweet spot for most TVs. Meeting the demands of most users is a financially sound decision. It's a safe decision. Certainly, the processors capable of decoding 4K video would have eaten into profit margins, or forced higher Apple TV prices. But remember when Apple used to be the forward-thinking company? Okay, maybe that's a tad inflammatory. In many cases, Apple products are (or at one point were) market leaders in forward-thinking. Think about the original iPod, iTunes, the first iPhone and iPads. Or the latest MacBook Pros, and the shift to USB-C ports. Going all in on USB-C was a very 'Bondi Blue iMac' decision by Apple. But I'm concerned about the Apple TV. 4K isn't an inevitable future possibility, it's happening now, in more and more households as potential cord cutters look for viable solutions. Embracing 4K lets current 4K TV owners in the Apple ecosystem use their TVs as God intended, and it gives developers a higher resolution canvas to design for. And in case you haven't noticed, 4K TV sales are soaring as prices plummet. Thankfully, the arrival of 4K on the Apple TV seems to be coming soon. But that's not the only thing needed. ...And gaming? This may be a stretch, but why not ship the Apple TV with game controllers? It doesn't have to be complicated; even something as simple as ancient SNES controllers would work. If Apple were to leverage its position and ship game controllers with the next Apple TV, it would give developers consistent hardware standards to write games around. Right now there are third-party options for controllers -- as well as the capability to use an iPhone as a game controller -- but that's not enough. If Apple wants its Apple TV to be a Trojan horse into the living room, the company needs to give buyers (and developers) something to cheer about. An Apple TV that's also a gaming machine could be a major differentiation from competing devices, and it would allow Apple to attract users who might not want to pay PS4 and Xbox money for gaming. Gaming could and should be treated as part of the next Apple TV's core functionality. There's been much talk over the years about Apple's desire to revolutionize the living room TV with Apple TV, but that hasn't yet happened. An Apple TV revamp doesn't need to reinvent the wheel to gain a bigger foothold; it just has to do what it does now, at higher resolutions and -- if Apple needs to justify a higher starting price -- offer real gaming support. So what's it going to be Apple -- stick with the hobby or get serious?

I've got good news and bad news … The bad news is you can't actually delete your Apple ID. The good news is you can come pretty doggone close. Here's how to deactivate, deauthorize, and sign out of your Apple ID on different devices! How to remove devices associated with your Apple ID We'll start by removing any devices that are associated with your Apple ID. You can do this on the web via Apple's Manage your Apple ID page or from an iOS device. Removing devices associated with your Apple ID will make it easier to sign in with a new Apple ID or use your devices without an Apple ID. Remove devices associated with your Apple ID on the web Go to appleid.apple.com and sign in with your Apple ID. If prompted, type in your two-factor authentication code. Scroll down to the Devices section. Choose a Device and click Remove. Click Remove this [Device] to confirm. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until all your devices have been removed. Remove devices associated with your Apple ID on iOS Launch the Settings app. Tap the Apple ID banner at the top of the main Settings screen. Scroll down to the section with your Apple devices. Tap on a Device. Tap Remove From Account. Tap Remove to confirm. Disable Find My iPhone, iPad, Mac Devices that have Find My iPhone (iPad/Mac/Apple Watch/etc.) enabled are associated with your Apple ID. In the event your device goes missing, you can use Find My iPhone (etc.) to find the device, lock the device, erase the device, and more. If you're trying to ditch your Apple ID, you definitely want to remove this association. Here's how to disable Find My iPhone (etc.) on iOS and macOS! Disable Find My Mac Launch System Preferences. Click iCloud. Scroll down to find the Find My Mac option. Click the checkbox to disable Find My Mac. Enter your Apple ID password and click Continue to confirm. Disable Find My iPhone/iPad Launch the Settings app. Tap the Apple ID banner at the top of the main Settings screen. Tap iCloud. Scroll down and tap Find My iPhone. Toggle off Find My iPhone. Enter your Apple ID password and tap Turn Off to confirm. Sign out of ALL THE THINGS! Now that you've removed your devices from your Apple ID and disabled Find My iPhone, iPad, Mac, etc., all that's left is signing out of your Apple ID on ALL THE THINGS. We'll start in iTunes on the Mac and work from there. Deauthorize your Apple ID on iTunes for Mac Deauthorizing iTunes on the Mac is important, because Apple only allows you a certain number of authorized devices that can access your iTunes library. When you deauthorize, you free up a spot for a new computer and/or new Apple ID. Launch iTunes. Click Account in the Mac menu bar. Choose Authorizations and click Deauthorize This Computer... Enter your Apple ID password and click Deauthorize to confirm. Sign out of your Apple ID account on Mac Now we'll sign out of your Apple ID account on the Mac. Launch System Preferences. Click iCloud. Click Sign Out in the bottom left corner of the iCloud preferences pane. If you'd like to keep a copy of your iCloud data on your Mac click Keep a Copy, otherwise deselect the data categories and click Continue. Sign out of your Apple ID account on iOS Launch the Settings app. Tap the Apple ID banner at the top of the main Settings screen. Scroll down to the bottom and tap Sign Out. Enter your Apple ID password to confirm. What a marathon! You've removed all the devices associated with your Apple ID via iCloud, you've turned off Find My iPhone, iPad, Mac, etc., you've deauthorized your devices in iTunes for Mac, and you've signed out across the board. Short of calling Apple Support and somehow getting them to delete your Apple ID (it's allegedly been done), you've done everything you can to "delete" your account. Let's just hope your Apple ID isn't also your primary email; if it is, you'll need to go to each website that's got your Apple ID email and update your account settings to whatever new email address you choose. Any questions? I'm wishing you all the best in this endeavor! If you run into any problems along the way, be sure to gimme a shout in the comments or over on Twitter. Reader comments How to delete your Apple ID 3 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating bobbob1016 You can delete your AppleID. Follow above, then call Apple and say you want it deleted. If they say it's not possible, they're new there, so just say "I need to be transferred to iTunes Tier 1 so they can transfer me to iTunes Tier 2 since they can delete AppleID's." When I worked there, they made sure I said "But do know that if you do this you will lose any purchases you've made" or something like that. Edit: The transfer route above is because an iTunes Tier 1 would know it is possible, and only a non-iTunes employee would say it's not possible, and you have to tell them to get to iTunes Tier 1 first, since iTunes Tier 2 hates when anyone but iTunes Tier 1 transfers to them. 1 2 days ago Reply mrbazz22 It is indeed possible and not all that difficult to delete an AppleID by calling Apple. Any advisor can assist with this and there should be no need to ask for someone in the iTunes Store team. If the advisor you get cannot help, just ask for a Senior Advisor. There will be some legal stuff that has to be mentioned, but the call should generally take no more than 10 minutes. 1 2 days ago Reply bobbob1016 I used to work AppleCare. And no, not everyone can. I used to have to refer to iTunes for this, I was just Mac+ (iPhone/iPad/Mac). I talked most people out of it since they thought it would fix their issues with locked iCloud accounts. 0 2 days ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Rural Americans turn to disability as jobs dry up Apple, Wal-Mart stick with climate promise Decisions come after Trump shaves U.S. policies Video Photo Bloomberg Emissions rise from the Dominion Resources Inc. Mount Storm Generating Station in Mount Storm, W. Va., in January. By Bloomberg News Apr 1, 2017 at 11:02 am | Print View Many of America’s biggest corporations including Apple and Wal-Mart Stores are sticking by their pledges to fight climate change even as President Donald Trump guts his predecessor’s environmental policies. Companies say their pledges, coordinated by the Obama administration, reflect their push to cut energy costs, head off activist pressure and address a risk to their bottom line in the decades to come. “This work is embedded in our business,” Wal-Mart spokesman Kevin Gardner said in an email. It’s “good for the business, our shareholders and customers; if ultimately we are able to positively impact the environment in the process, that’s a win, too.” Wal-Mart was one of 81 companies that promised to reduce emissions in the run up to the 2015 Paris global climate negotiations. The company upped its targets last November, saying it would get half its power from renewable sources by 2025. Trump signed an order Tuesday that tells the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider former President Barack Obama’s climate rules, and rescinds a series of orders Obama issued to embed consideration of climate change in government actions from where to lease buildings to whether to allow oil pipelines to be built. “Most big companies in the U.S. recognize that climate change is real,” Geoffrey M. Heal, a professor at Columbia Business School, said in a telephone interview. “They need to move ahead on the climate change front no matter what Trump’s government does.” Business’s biggest lobbying force supports Trump on this issue. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce welcomed Trump’s order calling that shift “vital to stimulating economic growth.” The group argues that Obama’s regulations held back economic growth, preventing business owners from constructing needed pipelines, roads and other infrastructure. It also warned that the climate push would lead to a jump in energy prices. But many of the group’s members and other corporate titans supported Obama’s Clean Power Plan, or have set their own goals. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest beer maker, also announced Tuesday that it would get 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025. Nearly 90 companies have made similar pledges, according to the Sierra Club. “We believe climate change is real and the science is well accepted,” General Electric’s CEO Jeffrey Immelt, wrote in an internal blog post shared by the company. “We hope that the United States continues to play a constructive role in furthering solutions to these challenges, and at GE, we will continue to lead with our technology and actions.” Mars, the maker of M&Ms, committed to eliminating its emissions entirely by 2040. Andy Pharoah, vice president of corporate affairs, said that Mars is “disappointed the administration has decided to roll back climate regulations.” Technology companies including Apple, Amazon.com, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft also expressed their support for Obama’s policies. “We believe that strong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change while also supporting American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth,” the companies said in a joint statement after Trump’s order was signed. Other companies, while stopping short of criticizing the Trump administration, said they would keep pursuing lower emissions in their own operations. Procter & Gamble, Nestle Inc., Ikea, Levi Strauss & Co. and Best Buy Co., which all signed the 2015 pledge organized by the Obama administration, said they still intended to honor their commitments. “We will continue to integrate sustainability into our business practices, operations, innovation, brand building and culture,” Damon Jones, a spokesman for Procter & Gamble said. Many energy businesses welcomed Trump’s rollback. The Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents oil and natural gas producers, joined the Chamber of Commerce in praising his move. So did the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenged the Clean Power Plan in court. “People are going to freeze in the dark because of the destruction of the reliable electric power grid under Obama and the Democrats,” Robert Murray, the president and CEO of coal-mining company Murray Energy Corp. said in an interview. “Mr. Trump is doing the right things.” Some environmental groups cautioned that action from the private sector, wasn’t enough to make up for the pullback in federal policy. “Policy is going to be required to get us where we need to be,” said Karen Palmer, research director at Resources for the Future.

HelloGbye, Breaker, Soon and other apps to check out this weekend   skip to main content skip to main menu     Apple may offer HBO, Showtime and Starz in a combined premium TV bundle By Christian Zibreg, Apr 2, 2017 Tweet 3 Comments Recode reported Sunday that Apple is considering offering a “premium TV bundle” with content from the networks HBO, Showtime and Starz. As I’m sure you’ll recall, the Cupertino company’s long been rumored to have been interested in creating a $30-$40 per month skinny bundle of top TV programming from multiple content owners. While App Store offers apps from each of those channels individually, Apple has reportedly approached the three networks about rolling them up into a single package, as conventional pay TV operators sometimes do. Apple currently sells subscriptions to HBO for $15 per month, Showtime for $11 per month and Starz for $9 per month, meaning customers who subscribe to all three channels are looking at a combined monthly subscription fee of at least $35. The price Apple might be seeking for the proposed bundle is unknown. A source who spoke to Recode said no deal has been reached as of yet. Notably, Apple doesn’t have a bundle deal in place with any of the premium networks, as per industry sources. Unlike traditional pay-TV operators which require you to subscribe to a basic level of TV channels before you can upgrade to a premium bundle, Apple could sell the bundle as a standalone product delivered via iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Apple TV.

Apple already enables users to buy the named channels individually, but according to a source who spoke to Recode, Apple has approached the three networks about rolling them up into a single paid package similar to how conventional TV operators market their channels. However, unlike paid TV operators like Charter, which usually require consumers to subscribe to a basic range of TV channels before offering a premium bundle, Apple wants to provide the package as an upfront standalone option for all its consumers. Apple has yet to nail down a deal with any of the networks, according to industry sources, while representatives from HBO, Stars, and Showtime declined to comment on the report. Apple also didn't respond to requests for comment. Apple currently offers HBO for $15 a month, Showtime for $11 a month, and Stars for $9 a month, but Recode had no information on the price of any possible bundle package. Apple's attempts to set up a traditional streaming bundle of TV channels have come to nothing in recent years, despite rival companies like Google and Hulu announcing plans of their own. In 2015, Apple was in talks for a streaming television service that would bundle several popular live channels and on-demand television at a price point of approximately $30 per month, but Apple canned the project after being unable to establish the necessary deals because content providers were reluctant to unbundle their channels. The company's assertive negotiation tactics with cable providers have also been blamed, with Apple executives accused of making demands networks aren't prepared to meet. Content providers meanwhile have been reluctant to agree to Apple's terms for fear of potentially compromising their traditional revenue streams. Apart from its TV subscription service ambitions, Apple is said to be building a "significant" business centered around creating original, scripted television shows and possibly even movies, for a possible launch by the end of 2017.

Yeah, you would be giving your hands, and maybe an arm and a leg... so you would pay $30/mo for this *new* Apple plan, plus $9.95 for that, plus $8.95/mo for that, plus $19.99/mo for that....... paying for all these services just to get half the channels you really want.... stick with the bundle dude.... it's cheaper. All you are doing is paying more money to more companies to get the keys to the walled gardens. And you end up paying more than you would because ISPs are going to up their prices for stand alone internet access, then reduce big time bundled packages with TV and internet. We are just chasing different methods to pay the same (or more) to the greedy media companies. Just different ways for them to get our money, just thinly disguised as the future. Now, if there were an open standard where all channels could submit their content, and we can purchase just what we want, well that would be the future of media. As it stands now, these are all just bundles and junior bundles and light bundles, but bundles none the less. Rating: 5 Votes Stevez67 6 hours ago at 05:49 pm Bundle = cord and I cut the cord.

Smartphone battery myths that need to die Jennifer Jolly, Special for USA Today Sunday, 02-Apr-17 18:32:28 PDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest The battery tech that powers most of our smartphones hasn’t changed much in the past few decades, but common knowledge about how to keep them in tip-top shape? That’s even worse. Here are the top five most common smartphone battery-life myths that need to die if you want to prolong your phone's overall lifespan, straight from the world’s leading battery experts. Myth #1 Smartphone batteries are made to last forever. Fact: The lithium-ion batteries found in most smartphones today are expected to maintain at least 80% of their original capacity for around 300 to 500 full charge cycles. That’s a pretty wide range. For me, a heavy user and charger, that means I get about one good year before my battery starts to poop out. For most other people, the average is about two years it shows significant signs of wear and tear. “They’re made with built-in obsolescence,” says Isidor Buchmann, CEO of Cadex Electronics and educational website Battery University. “The battery doesn’t die overnight, but they all fade without most people even knowing that it’s happening.” Apple has a few web pages dedicated to this very topic and explains it this way, “with lithium-ion batteries, the capacity diminishes slightly with each complete charge cycle.” But on the same Apple site, it also says that you can “charge your Apple lithium-ion battery whenever you want,” which gets confusing if misunderstood and leads us straight to myth #2. Myth #2: It doesn’t matter when or how long your charge your smartphone battery. Fact: If you don’t use your smartphone much, or upgrade every time a new model comes out, charge it whenever and however you want. But if you want it to be at it’s best the longest, “never run a battery to zero. That’s bad for it,” says Carl Howe former mobile analyst and Principal of Think Big Analytics. “The rule of thumb: To get your smartphone battery to last the longest, charge it to 80% and recharge it when it hits 20% to avoid stressing the system.” I think of it like snacking. Eating smaller portions several times a day is better than starving and overstuffing. Chronically letting a battery go all the way down to zero puts unneeded stress on the materials inside. Believe it or not, the same goes for letting it sit on your charger overnight, because being continually juiced up quickly — and to the max also leads lithium-ion batteries to corrode faster than they otherwise would. There isn’t any perfect solution, but all five of the experts we spoke with agreed, the sweet spot for smartphone batteries is indeed between 20% and 80%, and if you can keep it in or near those limits more often than not, you’ll be rewarded with a battery that lasts in the long run. Myth #3: It’s terrible to let your phone die. Fact: We just told you not to make it a daily habit, but if you want your battery to stretch its legs a bit every now and again, it’s okay to let it run a “full charge cycle,” or to let it die and then charge back up to 100% again. This helps the little computers that control the battery remember where its high and low points are, and will give you a more accurate reading of your charge. “My personal best practice is to let it drain completely every one-to-three months” says Stewart Tomassian, with gadget set-up service Enjoy in San Francisco. “all the way up and all the way dead, and then all the way back up again.” It’s not a must-do, and it will impact overall lifespan of the battery, but it can help keep your smartphone’s power gauges working as they should, and displaying the most up-to-date information possible. Myth #4: All chargers are basically the same. Fact: When it comes to charging, you really shouldn’t skimp on cords and adapters. When a company like Apple or Samsung makes a phone, they make their chargers to work in harmony with it. Reputable third party chargers are fine, but that cheap-o do-it-all charger you got from the gas station might not be. Poorly-made chargers might provide too little or — and this is the scary one — too much power for your gadget to handle. Too little juice and your phone charges super slowly, but too much and the battery has the potential to overheat, even to the point of failure. Spend the extra dollar or two and pick up officially approved chargers for your smartphone, and you’ll be much better off. Myth #5: If your battery’s dying, you have too many apps running. Fact: I love closing all my apps with a simple double tap and finger swipe up. It’s like cleaning house, but only takes a few seconds, and you have this seemingly clean slate to work from. It’s so darn satisfying, and yet so silly to do if you want your battery to stay alive. Certified Apple Consultant and former Apple Genius, Scotty Loveless explains, “yes, it does shut down the app, but what you don’t know is that you are actually making your battery life worse if you do this on a regular basis.” By closing the app, you also take if off the phones short-term memory list. So the next time you need it, it has to load it back up again from scratch. “All of that loading and unloading puts more stress on your device than just leaving it alone.” Loveless says. Less befuddled about batteries? Of course, there are exceptions to every rule and I look forward to comments and insights from battery-wise readers who can add to all of this. We also asked our handful of experts how to figure out, once and for all, what’s making your battery die so dang fast on a daily basis. That story, coming soon.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Soaring for a purpose Sunday Apr 2, 2017 at 1:31 PM Apr 2, 2017 at 1:31 PM Monica Solano Staff Writer @DP_MonicaInes APPLE VALLEY — For a handful of young first time flyers, the opportunity to fly in a light-sport aircraft Saturday morning was a high-flying experience they won't soon forget. “It was really fun getting to fly and the pilot was really nice and taught us about flying,” said Brielle Santos, 9, of Victorville. “It was a little scary when he did a rollercoaster trick where he pulled the plane to go straight up and then down, but it was still a lot of fun.” As part of a nationwide event hosted by the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) Young Eagles program, children were given the opportunity to see the High Desert from high above, and learn about the world of aviation. The Young Eagles of Apple Valley, Chapter 768 happily offered the free plane rides to their enthusiastic guests. “Sadly, aviation is kind of a dying sport and this is a great way to get those interested in not only the possibility of pursuing a career in aviation, but also understanding the importance of it as well,” said Young Eagles’ Coordinator Jeneace McBurney. “It’s been really encouraging to see so many kids out here interested in flying today and seeing their faces light up.” Founded in 1992, the Young Eagles program has dedicated nearly 25 years to giving youth ages 8 to 17 their first free ride in an airplane with the sole mission to introduce and inspire kids in the world of aviation. Since then, the program has flown more than 2 million children with the help of EAA’s network of volunteer pilots and crewman. “We’re a family of three who all happen to be pilots, and the funny thing about that is my son was introduced to aviation around the age of 10 and took his first flight similar to what we’re doing today,” said Flight Instructor and Pilot Gary McBurney. “What’s so great about aviation is that there’s a whole range of career options, like mechanism and design, for kids interested in entering into this field of study.” Gary McBurney, who was been flying for 12 years, was one of five pilots who volunteered his time and plane, taking more than 30 children up into the sky while also allowing them to get behind the controls for a brief period during the plane ride. Sisters Bella and Sofia Fernandes, of Apple Valley, both flew for first time together and although they said “it was scary at first” they happily exclaimed they would both “do it again.” “It was awesome, even though there were times the plane felt a little bumpy and I got scared,” Bella Fernandes said. “We also got to fly the plane and at one point I took off my headphones for a second to see how loud it was up there and it was.” After each plane had landed and everyone was back safely on the ground, each child received a certificate commemorating their first flight from the Young Eagles staff. The pilots may have received something better at the end, as each child hugged their instructor and thanked them for the times of their lives.    Monica Solano can be reached at MSolano@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6231.

The program was seen “as a way to help the city’s low-income students” bridge the digital divide and on paper, its raison d’etre appeared unassailable. It sought to use a popular technology (the Apple iPad); familiar to and readily embraced by children across the socio-economic divide to educate the mostly low-income students in the Los Angeles school district; students who typically struggle/d academically. Unfortunately, the project was plagued with problems from the get-go. Tod Newcombe in the publication Government Technology writes that: “Internet connectivity was spotty at some schools, partly because the district’s facilities chief was not included in the planning process for upgrading school networks to carry the heavy data demands of so many devices connecting to the Internet. Teachers were ill-trained on how to use the iPads and curriculum, and faculty never widely embraced the tablet…..And many students learned how to bypass the security features and just used the iPads to surf the Internet.” Further review of the program revealed that the LAUSD had “added detailed specifications regarding screen size and touchscreen functionality that heavily favored Apple and essentially excluded other technology options”. In other words, the school district effectively single-sourced the project. Sound familiar? With great fanfare, Kenya’s ruling Jubilee Coalition, aptly headed by the self-described “digital duo” launched the Laptop Project shortly after taking power in 2013. Brushing aside widespread criticism, the Jubilee-majority Parliament approved KSh.15.3Billion ($153Million) for implementation of Phase I of the project. Four years later, the program is still an inexplicable and murky labyrinth of lofty presidential proclamations amidst spotty evidence of its (actual) implementation. The president and his supporters have essentially “declared the project a success and headed home”. Its incompetent and bungled implementation aside, the project also illustrates the misplaced priorities of President Kenyatta’s government. Consider the following: While the mobile-cellular system in Kenya’s urban areas (25% of the country’s population) is “generally good”, internet access outside Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu and Nakuru is marginal at best – a fact I can attest to. Internet usage is a generous 45% according to data from the CIA World Factbook. A back-of-the-envelope analysis indicates that ~75% of Kenya’s population resides outside the connected and electrified urban areas. Writing for BBC Africa, Emmanuel Igunza asked a question that should have been asked and definitively answered BEFORE the project got off the ground. Even more telling is that the question “Are laptops more important than desks in Kenya’s schools?” was asked in 2016, approximately 3 years after the project supposedly got off the ground! Unlike the country’s parliamentarians who are among the world’s best-compensated legislatures, Kenya’s teachers just endured a bruising battle over pay and amenities – working in an educational system that is rife with corruption, violence and dilapidated oftentimes non-electrified, non-internet connected AND non-existent structures! Juxtaposed, the foregoing facts (which don’t even include the on-going crisis in the country’s healthcare sector) are a searing indictment on Uhuru Kenyatta’s sense of prudence and practicality. They also speak to his government’s misplaced priorities. While Jubilee was quick to get this signature project off the ground (itself a topic for another day), Mr. Kenyatta’s government also believed its own rhetoric on its (project’s) immediate benefits. The president’s party – Jubilee – wallowed in its hubris even as it shut out dissenting voices and failed to perform adequate due diligence. A simply review of similar projects (worldwide) would have provided the president and his team a set of guidelines and considerations to inform implementation of its own including the following: – That single-sourcing most projects is usually not a good thing; in this case exacerbated by the differing customer (student and teacher) needs, – That projects of such scope and size require extensive, competent and consistent planning AND leadership, – That like the students in Kenya, few students in LAUSD had consistent and adequate internet access, – That computers, as is the case with other technologies, are just one more tool that can improve the education process. Without a well-designed curriculum AND competent teachers to use said tool, GIGO – Garbage In. Garbage Out, – That like their LA counterparts who learnt how to bypass the security features of the school-issued iPad, seven-year-old Tasmin Abdalla of Mombasa’ Sparki Primary School declared that s/he’ll “be able to watch cartoons…not write”; a sentiment echoed by Lincoln Maina of Roysambu Primary School – that he will use the computer “to teach his friends a few of the games he enjoys at home”, The laptop project, like the ostentatious Two Rivers Mall, billion-shilling homes, “dollar millionaires”, Porsche dealerships and Swarovski stores, while indicators of a progressing economy also belie a paraphrased view offered by Ms. Sarah Ruto, an education researcher: That while technology enhances productivity and “improves things”, it is not a panacea for corrupt and incompetent governance nor is it the only bridge between society’s many fault-lines of which the digital divide is one.

It’s a last-ditch effort to plug a gap after the firm reported a heavy one-off $6.3 billion loss in December 2016, prompting its chairman to resign. Korean Herald cited yesterday’s report in Yomiuri Shimbun Daily claiming that Apple, Amazon and Google are engaged in a bidding war to acquire the Japanese giant’s NAND flash unit. A very diverse conglomerate, Toshiba is Apple’s top supplier of memory chips for iOS devices and files as the second-largest flash chip maker in the world after Samsung Electronics. On Thursday, Toshiba shareholders agreed to split off the NAND flash unit and sell it. The conglomerate’s financial stability was endangered when Westinghouse Electric, Toshiba’s US nuclear unit, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after struggling with hefty losses that have thrown its Japanese parent into a crisis. Westinghouse has suffered huge cost overruns at two projects in Georgia and South Carolina. Writing down Westinghouse’s US nuclear business could see Toshiba’s total losses last year exceed 1 trillion yen, or about $9.1 billion. Shares in Toshiba have fallen more than 45 percent since late December. Valued at between $9 billion and $13 billion, Toshiba’s memory chip unit is the second-biggest in the world after Samsung’s. Now that Apple, Amazon and Google are bidding to acquire Toshiba’s flash chip unit, SK Hynix’s chances of winning the bid have been lowered. Should SK Hynix acquire Toshiba’s memory chip unit, it will become the world’s largest NAND flash maker. Here are the shares and movers when its comes to memory chips: Samsung Electronics—37 percent share Toshiba—18 percent share Western Digital—17 percent share Micron Technology—10 percent share SK Hynix—9.6 percent share Other firms expressed interest in acquiring Toshiba’s NAND flash unit, too. These include storage vendor Western Digital, iPhone manufacturer Foxconn, Apple chip maker TSMC, imaging company Canon, wireless chip designer Broadcom, the Development Bank of Japan and others. Chinese-language Liberty Times reported last month that Foxconn and TSMC could join forces in an attempt to acquire a majority stake in Toshiba’s memory chip business. Western Digital is thought to be the most attractive bidder as the two firms jointly operate Toshiba’s key NAND flash production base in Yokaichi. “Then comes SK Hynix, which can create synergy with Toshiba as the same chip makers,” said a source. Foxconn is the least attractive bidder as Toshiba and the Japanese government do not want to sell the firm to Chinese companies because of the technology leak concerns stemming from the fact that memory chips can be applied to military technology. At any rate, a successful bid by one of Apple’s key suppliers, or Apple itself, could pose a great challenge to Samsung Electronics’ leadership in the flash memory market because the Galaxy maker could easily lose Apple as its main client.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley's Store 'just keeps on livin,' reaches 100 Sunday Apr 2, 2017 at 11:22 AM Apr 2, 2017 at 11:23 AM Monica Solano Staff Writer @DP_MonicaInes APPLE VALLEY — Karl Store said “he couldn’t be more happier” as he celebrated his 100th birthday surrounded by family and friends. “I’m very blessed to have made it. I don’t have to worry about peer pressure anymore," Store quipped. Saturday was a day of celebration at Rock Springs Senior Living Homes in Apple Valley, as more than 60 family members, including nine grandchildren, 21 great-grandchildren and three great-great grandchildren to celebrate the milestone. “In the last two years my dad has gone through major surgery and two battles of pneumonia,” said Store’s daughter Jeanne Copps. “But he’s a fighter and continues to surprise us. I’m incredibly amazed by him because he’s someone who just keeps on living.” Born in 1917, Store was raised on a corn farm in Starbuck, Minnesota, during the Great Depression, where he began working at the age of 10 and was raised by his older sisters after their mother had died. “To this day my grandfather hates corn, seeing as they were so poor back then and all they had to eat was corn as he and his sisters had to find different ways to cook it,” said Store’s granddaughter Kristy Harrison. “He’s seen and lived through a lot. I’m just so overwhelmed by the amount of love from our family as many of them came from such a long ways to be here today.” Growing up, Store served in the Army as a technical sergeant in the Philippines during World War II as he was tasked with alerting his comrades to enemy aircraft. Sometime later, Store met his wife Elizabeth, and the two were happily married on May, 17, 1942. The couple had four children — three daughters and a son. His wife passed away in 2002 after 60 years of marriage. “My favorite memory would have to be meeting my Betty,” Store recalled. After the war, Store worked and helped run a small grocery store called KirkPeter's in Perris for about 30 years. Store and his family resided in the Riverside area from 1942 to 2011. Later in 2011, Store and his family moved to the High Desert where he now lives out his days at Rock Springs. Some of Store’s accomplishments include receiving a certificate from the American Legion for being the oldest living veteran member, serving in the Legion for more than 70 years. A devout Catholic, Store has also been a member of the Knights of Columbus for more than 60 years. “It’s crazy to think he’s 100 years old,” said Store’s great-granddaughter Betty Harrison. “Growing up, I remember he would watch me and my sisters while also playing cards and solving puzzles. He’s really quite amazing.” As loved ones gathered around to sing “Happy Birthday,” Store said he felt “very blessed” to have lived to see this day along with the love and unity of his family.

The rest of my feedback is filled with minor annoyances that I think I could learn to deal with…. I Loathe Commercials Overall, I despise the streaming services because I cannot find a way to escape the endless barrage of commercials. Avoiding commercials is the only thing that makes watching television even remotely bearable. Pre-Streaming, My Bill: DirecTV with 18MB U-Verse internet service; no home or cell phone plans (and no I am not a caveman, my work pays for my cell phone). Monthly bill = ~$215: Internet = $57 XTRA TV Package = $82 HBO and Sports = $31 Inside Wiring Protection = $8 Regional Sports Fee = $3.63 Two rooms HD + DVR = $30; reading my bill for the first time in a long time, this is: $10 Advanced Receiver HD, $10 Advanced Receiver DVR, $3 Whole Home DVR and $7 Additional TV One Client. Wow. I have only two rooms: both HD, one with a DVR and the other can play the DVR by using the Whole Home "feature". As you can see, this is a ridiculous amount of money for two TVs and 18MB internet service. I could cut out about $100 per month moving to a streaming service. Taking the Plunge Last Monday, I called DirecTV and asked if I were in contract, and I wasn't. I asked when my next bill would be due: the following day. I told her to cancel effective immediately, so I wouldn't be charged the next day (I was charged anyway but that's a whole 'nother story). I started researching and a few sites were saying how much better DirecTVNOW is, and when looking online if you prepay for three months (@$40 per) you get a free Apple TV which I know retail is ~$150. The offer supposedly was to end 4/1/17 so I did it on the spot. I wanted an Apple TV anyway, so even if I didn't decide on sticking with DNOW, I still get an Apple TV and save $30. DirecTV NOW Sucks I can add shows to my "WatchList" which is their version of a DVR. But if I don't watch something live, I can't stream it later that night and have to wait a week to watch it. And let me say this before going any further because it cannot be said enough: COMMERCIALS ARE THE DEVIL. I DESPISE THEM WITH EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING. The reason DVRs are awesome is because I don't have to watch the absolutely awful onslaught of dumb ass commercials that are not entertaining at all and are a complete waste of my time. One of the shows that I like is American Crime: I didn't get around to watching the last episode on my old DVR, so when I make the switch to DNOW I added America Crime to my Watch List. Much to my dismay, I cannot stream the previous episode at all. I think the rule is that it has to be a week old, because I check again several days later and I could watch the last episode. Much to my dismay again, I play it and have to sit through COMMERCIALS. And not only commercials, but the same ones over and over and over and over again, trying to get me to watch other ABC shows. I thought this was just ABC, so I tried to watch last week's Walking Dead - same thing. Cannot watch Sunday night's episode, had to wait. In ATL, it doesn't have CBS at ALL. I cannot watch or stream Survivor even with commercials, and wasn't quite sure how I would watch last night's Final Four. Maybe I could do it via the March Madness app on my Apple TV? More on this later. The Guide is awful: it is alphabetical. I am used to DirecTV that primarily groups all like channels together: local channels 0-100, sports from 206-220, sports packages 601-660, HBO and pay channels 501-599, and everything else from 221 to 501. There is no previous channel button. There is no last four channels like there was on DTV (which is awesome for someone who is allergic to commercials like I am). There is no Picture in Picture like there was on DTV. For someone who avoids commercials like the plague, all of these things are mandatory for me to avoid a nervous breakdown. Last night, I sit down to watch the Final Four, knowing that I will have to sit through commercials. I break out in hives. I have the mute button handy so I won't damage my TV when I am forced to watch the same Charles Barkley, Samuel L. and Spike commercials over and over and over again. Since there is no CBS, I go to the March Madness app on the Apple TV. No can do. Some kind of error saying that this is not allowed, and I have to stream it via an iPhone, iPad, etc. I do so, and throw the feed to my TV via AirPlay, and the feed is so awful I can barely see the score. I put my phone on top of my internet router to see if me being five feet away from it is the issue, and same awful feed. Since I am already unhappy with DNOW, I know that PS Vue has a "Cloud DVR" and free seven day trial. At a commercial break, I get on my PS4 and sign up. Easy Peasy. I get on the guide, tune to CBS and no feed issues. Phew. But I still can't pause live TV so I can avoid slicing open my wrists when forced to sit through those commercials that someone should be killed for making. Steak on a Plane? Are you effing serious? Someone should lose their job over this. PS Vue sucks, too. The guide is awful. For some reason, they thought they'd be clever and switch the X and Y axes. So the channels are across the top and the times are on the left. This is really effing stupid. You can only see five channels at a time, but HEY AT LEAST YOU KNOW WHATS ON THOSE FIVE CHANNELS TWO HOURS AGO AND TWO HOURS IN THE FUTURE. Whoever made this decision should be shot. Again, like DNOW, the guide is alphabetical order. The "DVR" is called "My Shows". When you add a show to My Shows it will allow you to watch a ton of older shows. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I STILL CAN'T FAST FORWARD THROUGH COMMERCIALS. Un. Nerv. Ing. Since PSV has CBS, I can watch last week's Survivor and with it comes the commercials for CBS shows, only slightly bearable because Tea Leoni is smoking hot and one of my all time faves. Something about her voice. Anywayyyyyyy.... The one saving grace of PSV is it does have a "last channel" button which allows me to avoid commercials. But, unlike DirecTV I don't think I can pause Live TV, so I don’t miss the show while I avoid commercials flipping to another channel. It does have Picture in Picture - you can actually watch three shows at once. YAY! But I don’t know if I can do this while watching DVR’d shows, which I can do on DTV. And I still haven’t figured out how to get out of PiP once in it. I've had to close the app and restart it to kill it. PSV doesn’t broadcast in 7.1 (two channel only) which renders my $5,000 surround sound system moot, nor does it have a way to change the volume. The Bottom Line: I can’t watch TV like this. I haven’t even made it one week, or to one season of any SU sport, and I just can’t. I will pay $75 more per month so I don’t have to watch commercials. I am on this earth for a very short time, and it is worth every penny to be able to FF through commercials and be able to watch hour long programs on my DVR in 42 minutes and not one hour. Those 18 minutes X 100,000 shows I will watch in my lifetime adds up (180,000 minutes = 3.5 years). And yes, I watch A TON of TV. Not to mention purposely starting sporting events 30 minutes behind so I can slowly catch up to live, all while avoiding those commercials. I will be calling DirecTV back, and will ask them about all of the BS I was being charged for. I will kill my second TV in my house and only use that one for Apple TV/Netflix/Prime. And yes, I have issues. I realize that I am one of the least patient people on this planet and get easily annoyed by really mundane things that don't bother others. And no, this is not a cry for help. :)  Tweet Share on Twitter Share Share on Facebook Pin Pinterest 2 Comments Recent FanPosts My Cord Cutting Experience So Long, Old Frenemy Watching Hopkins presser at UW Next year and defense My Confession - Am I a bad son?

An undisclosed portion of sales of the phone will support The Global Fund to Fight AIDS. But the product is strangely missing from the Chinese version of Apple’s website, which promotes a red phone but has no mention of the disease.   Apple didn’t respond to my question about why that’s the case. But my colleague Jingsi Christina Wu, a professor of media studies at Hofstra University, said the Chinese government probably didn’t approve of the (PRODUCT)RED message. Although HIV/AIDS is a major public health challenge for China, she said the government doesn’t generally like to acknowledge it openly. Part of the problem is its association with homosexuality and sexually transmitted diseases in general — subjects the government still considers somewhat taboo. According to Human Rights Watch, the country has threatened and suppressed the work of HIV activists.   It’s understandable that Apple is concerned about keeping the Chinese government happy; the country has banned other technology companies such as Facebook and Twitter. But for Apple, the decision likely won’t be worth the costs. Instead, it could have negative repercussions far beyond the country.   In our hyper-connected world, there’s no such thing as a local public relations strategy. Brands may tailor their messages differently for particular parts of the world, but anything they do can easily be accessed via the internet by customers in other nations. HIV activists around the globe are not going to be happy to hear that Apple isn’t actively promoting this product in China. So the move may call the company’s commitment to fighting the disease into question — which is, of course, the opposite of the company’s intended goal in launching (PRODUCT)RED.   IKEA made a similar mistake in 2012, when it airbrushed images of women out of their catalogues in Saudi Arabia. This may have seemed appropriate for the local market, but when women in other parts of the world found out, they were outraged. “It is impossible to retouch women out of reality,” Sweden’s then-trade minister told the press. The company later apologised and acknowledged that the decision was not in line with its values.   Similarly, a 2014 Cadillac commercial about the American dream that made fun of workers in other countries who take “the whole of August off” was perceived as “anti-French” in the French media. As one Paris-based magazine complained: “The latest advert for the luxury brand leads us to believe the French are lazy, spending their time relishing their paid holidays. Charming.” The company later clarified that it was meant to serve as a “brand provocation”.   That’s why global companies need to choose values they can defend globally — and uphold them consistently.   This apparent concession to the Chinese government is especially discordant with the brand identity Apple has worked hard to cultivate. © Bloomberg Read More On Business Life | Iphone | Jingsi Christina Wu | Homosexuality | Human Rights | Sweden | Cadillac Commercial | Marketing | International | Others PREVIOUS STORY NEXT STORY RECOMMENDED FOR YOU Advertisements Club ITC - 25% earnings on dining at ITC Hotels The 'One' Sedan the World's Elite Prefer to Drive Cover from Natural Calamities.

Experience however reveals that the two can blend with ease with a careful application of mind and a spirit of compromise. Those who have taken extreme positions on the subject are equally passionate and articulate. Most of them are at least partially right. The debate is extremely crucial to an expanding cyberspace. The contentious arguments between pro- and anti-privacy champions had remained somewhat dormant after last year’s tussle between the FBI and the US giant Apple, in which the two mighty organisations fought over the former’s demand that Apple should help them break open a locked iPhone that had been used by a terrorist couple before their attack on a government employee group in San Bernardino, California. Apple had expressed its helplessnesss at that time saying that the passcode was personal to the owner of the phone; even the manufacturer was not privy to it. It also said that opening a back door to facilitate an FBI investigation was a breach of assurance to customers who had been told that their communication channel was foolproof and inviolable. The FBI then got hold of an individual who unlocked the phone. Incidentally, nothing of significance was found.Hacking the phone The controversy has resurfaced following the incident near the British Parliament when Khalid Masood killed four persons, including a police constable. The Metropolitan Police found that Masood had sent at least one WhatsApp message before the dastardly act. The Met believes that Masood’s hitherto unidentified contact could help unravel any conspiracy behind the crime. However, there is a stalemate flowing from WhatsApp’s stand that it is helpless in the matter. It has cited in its defence the technology of end-to-end encryption embedded in the system designed by Open Whisper Systems. In 2014 the two organisations entered into a partnership whereby end-to-end encryption became a default feature of the instant messaging system. Any message initiated by user A could be read by the addressee B only. Nobody else — including WhatsApp — would ever be able to decipher it. There were no servers in which messages were stored. WhatsApp is a post office-cum-facilitator rather than a storehouse of data. This was security at its tightest, similar to the one guaranteed by Apple. Opening a ‘back door’ for a third party is technically an impossibility and an anathema. Top security WhatsApp’s claim is that the protocol guarantees “...confidentiality, integrity, authentication, participant consistency, destination validation, forward secrecy, backward secrecy (aka future secrecy), causality preservation, message unlinkability, message repudiation, participation repudiation, and asynchronicity”. UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd is backing the Met to the hilt. She convened a meeting of technology firms on March 30 at which she appealed to them to cooperate with law enforcement agencies. The companies agreed to do so. Beyond this there does not seem to have been any qualitative change to the situation, with privacy concerns trumping over any other consideration. No company is learnt to have given any undertaking with regard to encryption. There is little evidence so far that WhatsApp’s claim of helplessness and foolproof security is either bogus or extravagant. But it begs the question whether such a tight security system is warranted when the terrorist scene is grave. Those who are critical of attempts to dilute the laboriously built security features of WhatsApp allege disproportionate reaction by the government and its security outfits to the misdeeds of a handful of terrorists. They feel that however secure you might make a system, the ingenious terrorist will always manage to find a viable alternative. Clearly, this is a debate without losers or gainers, one in which each side is at least partly right.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple explores the use of Titanium, Titanium Alloys and Hybrid Plastics for Future Devices | Main April 02, 2017 Apple Patent Reveals a Visual System to Assist Siri in Future Devices to understand Gestures, Activities, & More   In December 2015 Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Continues to Build a New Team that is focused on 'Deep Learning' Technology for Autonomous Vehicles." That was the first time we heard of Apple having a 'deep learning team.' While one of the projects related to autonomous vehicles, the team is obviously involved in a wide range of projects. Back in June 2016 Apple's Craig Federighi, Senior VP of Software Engineering for iOS and macOS went out of his way to show the advancements in Siri's ability to understand deep questions relating to Siri's new "deep learning" capabilities. Back in October 2016, Google delivered their manifesto on the arrival of the AI revolution.   So it is clear that the shift to deep learning systems using next generation user interfaces for Home and Vehicle Automation markets is where the next revolution rests.   While Google tried to plant a mental flag on deep learning being something that they were first to bring to market, I'm not quite sure that will stick. A Forbes article published last year attempted to frame this next revolution as one being led by Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon – leaving Apple out of the equation which couldn't have been further from the truth. Between Siri, their acquisition of Vocal IQ and their deep learning team in general, Apple is most definitely in the game if not poised to lead it in the future.   This week a master patent came to light regarding deep learning. A master patent usually covers a new area of technology with broad strokes to provide a grand overview of the subject matter. In the future new patent filings will then break out varying elements of the technology and elaborate on it in more detail and perhaps for specific products Apple has in mind.   Today's report is no doubt long, but it's because it's an overview of a new 'Intelligent System' that could be a part of a next-generation HDTV system, an advanced 'Apple TV' box, a Home specific device or a Mac down the road.   While the system will integrate Siri for voice, this week's patent is really about the brains and eyes of a future AI system. You may say 'Hey Siri' to get the systems attention or you'll be able to use a gesture to summon Siri or directly instruct the system to do something like answer your phone or start your car. The system will also perform advanced functions like adjust the audio of a movie or new Tune so that when you walk around a room the audio will be adjusted to your new position in the room; lower or raise the volume, base or treble as required to ensure the sound is optimal for the user.   Though in the end, the patent is really about giving eyesight to the new intelligent system via 3D cameras by Apple' acquired LinX that could fine tune the system's understanding of a gesture system tied to instructions or intent of the user.   Patent Background   Traditional user interfaces for computers and multi-media systems are not ideal for a number of applications and are not sufficiently intuitive for many other applications. In a professional context, providing stand-up presentations or other types of visual presentations to large audiences is one example where controls are less than ideal and, in the opinion of many users, insufficiently intuitive. In a personal context, gaming control and content viewing/listening are but two of many examples. In the context of an audio/visual presentation, the manipulation of the presentation is generally upon the direction of a presenter that controls an intelligent device (e.g. a computer) through use of remote control devices. Similarly, gaming and content viewing/listening also generally rely upon remote control devices. These devices often suffer from inconsistent and imprecise operation or require the cooperation of another individual, as in the case of a common presentation. Some devices, for example in gaming control, use a fixed location tracking device (e.g., a trackball or joy-stick), a hand cover (aka, glove), or body-worn/held devices having incorporated motion sensors such as accelerometers. Traditional user interfaces including multiple devices such as keyboards, touch/pads/screens, pointing devices (e.g. mice, joysticks, and rollers), require both logistical allocation and a degree of skill and precision, but can often more accurately reflect a user's expressed or implied desires. The equivalent ability to reflect user desires is more difficult to implement with a remote control system.   When a system has an understanding of its users and the physical environment surrounding the user, the system can better approximate and fulfill user desires, whether expressed literally or impliedly. For example, a system that approximates the scene of the user and monitors the user activity can better infer the user's desires for particular system activities. In addition, a system that understands context can better interpret express communication from the user such as communication conveyed through gestures. As an example, gestures have the potential to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks regarding user interface through conventional remote controls. Gestures have been studied as a promising technology for man-machine communication. Various methods have been proposed to locate and track body parts (e.g., hands and arms) including markers, colors, and gloves. Current gesture recognition systems often fail to distinguish between various portions of the human hand and its fingers. Many easy-to-learn gestures for controlling various systems can be distinguished and utilized based on specific arrangements of fingers. However, current techniques fail to consistently detect the portions of fingers that can be used to differentiate gestures, such as their presence, location and/or orientation by digit.   Computer or Entertainment System for responding to user Presence and Activity   Apple's invention illustrates the use of an intelligent system that responds to user intent and desires based upon activity that may or may not be expressly directed at the system.   The intelligent system acquires a depth image of a scene surrounding the system. A scene geometry may be extracted from the depth image and elements of the scene, such as walls, furniture, and humans may be evaluated and monitored.   Apple's filing notes that "In certain embodiments, user activity in the scene is monitored and analyzed to infer user desires or intent with respect to the system. For example, if the user is observed leaving the room, the output of the intelligent system may be paused." In context, Apple later identifies some of the hardware that this 'intelligent system' on pause is designed to work with: a television, a set top box, a multi-media entertainment system and general purpose computer system.   In addition, the scene geometry may be a factor in the system's response. As an example, if a user enters a portion of the scene with low acoustic reflectance, the audio volume of the system output may be increased to compensate for the relatively decreased acoustic reflection being experienced by the user.   In other embodiments, the intelligent system may determine that the user is attempting to engage the system to provide express instructions. If express instructions are interpreted, some embodiments contemplate slavishly following the express instruction, and other embodiments contemplate generally following the instructions, while, however, compensating based upon scene geometry.   For example, if user is detected as older in age and that user expressly requests a higher volume, the system may decide that the user requires better differentiation of voice dialog in the system output. Therefore, the system may change the relative spectral distribution of the system output (to relatively amplify voice) rather than increase the average volume.   Apple's invention covers concepts that provide a method to identify fine hand gestures based on real-time three-dimensional (3D) sensor data. The method includes receiving a first depth map of a region of space, the first depth map having a first plurality of values, each value indicative of a distance.   Overall, the invention pertains to systems, methods, and computer readable media to improve the operation of user interfaces including scene interpretation, user activity, and gesture recognition. In general, techniques are disclosed for interpreting the intent or desire of one or more users and responding to the perceived user desires, whether express or implied. Many embodiments of the invention employ one or more sensors used to interpret the scene and user activity. Some example sensors may be a depth sensor, an RGB sensor and even ordinary microphones or a camera with accompanying light sensors.   Varying embodiments of the invention may use one or more sensors to detect the user's scene. For example, if the system serves as a living room entertainment system, the scene may be the user's living room as well as adjacent areas that are visible to the sensors.   The scene may also be as small as the space in front of a user's workstation or the interior of a car.   In an even a small area adjacent to a user's smart phone or other portable device (to interpret user desires with respect to that device).   On the flip side, the scene may additionally be large, for example, including an auditorium, outdoor area, a playing field, or even a stadium. In sum, the scene may be any area where there is a value for intelligent systems such as computers or entertainment systems to interpret user intent or desire for system activity.   Many embodiments of the invention allow for direct user manipulation of the system either to operate system settings or to control an application of the system such as games, volume, tuning, composing, or any manipulations that a user might expressly desire from the system in use.   The intelligent system may also have device sensors which may include one or more of: depth sensors (such as a depth camera); 3D depth sensor(s); imaging devices (such as a fixed and/or video-capable image capture unit); RGB sensors; proximity sensors; ambient light sensors; accelerometers; gyroscopes; any type of still or video camera; LIDAR devices; SONAR devices; microphones, CCDs (or other image sensors), infrared sensors, thermometers, etc. These and other sensors may work in combination with one or more GPUs, DSPs or conventional microprocessors along with appropriate programming so that the sensor outputs may be properly interpreted and/or combined to contribute to the interpretation a scene and user activity within the scene.   Scene Geometry   In Apple's patent FIGS. 4a and 4b illustrated below we're able to see embodiments contemplate detection of the scene geometry by the system #405 or devices and equipment in cooperation with the system. One or more sensors may be employed to detect the scene geometry, which generally refers to the structure of the room in two or three dimensions.   For example, one type of scene geometry contemplated for embodiments of the invention involves determining or estimating the location and/or nature of each element in a space visually or acoustically exposed to the system (e.g. television, set-top box, a multi-media entertainment center or computer system). Thus, varying embodiments of the invention may determine or estimate the two- or three-dimensional position of vertical surfaces such as walls; horizontal surfaces #435, such as floors; furniture #410 or other chattel #440; fixtures #445; as well as living things, such as pets or humans #430. By understanding scene geometry, the system may provide a better experience for the user.   Apple notes that "Some embodiments employ one or more sensors to recover scene geometry. One type of sensor that may be used is a depth camera, which may serve as a type of depth sensor (e.g. cameras provided by LinX Imaging)." For the record, Apple acquired LinX two years ago.   At present, some depth cameras provide multiple sensing modalities such as depth detection and infrared reflectance. Depth detection recovers the existence of objects or portions of objects as well as the distance of the objects from the sensor. Thus, for example, referring to FIG. 4a, a depth detection of the scene taken from a sensor in the system should recover data representing the approximate dimension and location of: the three vertical surfaces 401 (walls) in front of the system; the horizontal surface(s) 435 (floor); the person 430; and separate parts of the furniture 410 (because varying parts of the furniture have different depths).   In addition to depth detection, some contemporary depth cameras also detect infrared reflectance. Information regarding infrared reflectance of an object reveals properties of the object including information about color. Information detected regarding infrared reflectance can be used with the depth information to aid in identifying objects in the room or potentially determining how those objects affect the use of the system in the scene (e.g., the effects on a user's perception of light and sound).   System Response   Under the section identified as 'System Response,' Apple notes that varying embodiments of their invention employ detecting user activity and/or the indicators of that activity in order to shape or alter a system service.   Audio service is one example of shaping or altering a system service in response to user activity. A user's perception of audio varies based upon the user's physical position with respect to the audio source(s). Changes in a user's location with a scene may cause variations in perceived volume or in the perceived balance of spectral components that arrive at the user's ears.   In the case of volume, there is a 6 dB drop in sound intensity (e.g., volume) for every doubling of distance from an audio source. Therefore, a user's distance from the audio source affects the volume of the sound that the user perceives.   In addition, even in an open room, only a portion of the sound perceived by a user travels directly from the source to the user's ears. Referring to FIGS. 9a and 9b below, simple examples of these concepts are shown. System #405 may radiate sound that travels both directly #950 and indirectly #925 to the user. Thus, by understanding scene geometry, the system may account for user location in adjusting both the spectral power distribution and the overall intensity of the audio.   In some embodiments, the intelligent system's understanding of scene geometry extends to the acoustic reflectiveness of the various surfaces, and this capability enhances the system's potential to refine a responsive adjustment with respect to both volume and spectral balance.   In some embodiments, the system may automatically adjust volume or sound intensity according to a user's position in the room. If the user becomes closer to an audio source, the intensity may be proportionally decreased. If the user moves further away from a source the intensity may be proportionally increased. The concept similarly applies to situations with multiple audio sources where each source may be altered accordingly or an overall average intensity (or other aggregating function) may be altered in response to user movements. In some embodiments with only one user in the scene the former arrangement may be preferred (i.e., volume of a source proportional to user distance), while in some embodiments with multiple users, the latter arrangement may be more desirable (i.e., average or aggregated volume proportional to average or aggregated distance).   Engagement Analysis   Under the section identified as 'Engagement Analysis' Apple turns to patent FIG. 11 noted above. There we're able to see a process for determining whether a user in the scene is engaged with the system (i.e., trying to communicate with the system).   The process of FIG. 11 illustrates the use of an RGB sensor and a depth sensor which are respectively employed for face detection #1120 and head orientation detection #1140. A registration is performed at #1150 to align the face detection results with the head orientation results. The registration provides information so that a more precise facial feature may be accurately paired with a more precise head orientation. This added information may be used during engagement analysis #1160 to more accurately determine if the user is engaging the system.   For example, if the user is speaking as the user's head orientation is moving toward the system, then the intent to engage is more likely. If the user is speaking as the head orientation leans toward another user, the user's intent is more likely conversation. If the engagement analysis determines that the user is not engaged #1170, then the system need not do anything #1180. If the engagement analysis determines that the user is engaged, then the system should respond. For example, if the user is asking to increase the volume, then the system should increase the volume. Some embodiments of the invention contemplate the use of learning loops #1165, which augment the engagement analysis with information learned from successes and failures in prior activity when responding or not responding. In some embodiments that employ learning loops, the system keeps a record of its engagement analysis and responsive action (or not).   Fine Gesture Detection   Under the section identified as 'Fine Gesture Detection' Apple turns to patent figure FIG. 14 where in one embodiment, 3D region #1400 is sensed by 3D image sensor system #1405 where region #1400 includes individual #1410 making a hand gesture and a depth of field #1515.   In Apple's patent FIG. 15 we're able to see a sensor data of region #1400 captured by the 3D image sensor system that may be analyzed slice-by-slice.   As shown, in some embodiments, each slice #1520 has overlap #1525 with an immediately prior slice and a thickness #1530. In general, the slice thickness should be "thick" enough to engulf an individual's hand or other target object but not so thick as to include an excess amount of other structure so as to make hand detection more difficult.   Three-dimensional sensor data acquisition in accordance with this disclosure may use any of a variety of optical and/or non-optical sensors. Optical sensors use light to carry depth information and include, for example, laser triangulation sensors and stereo vision systems. Non-optical sensors include acoustic (e.g., ultrasonic and seismic) sensors and electromagnetic (e.g., infrared, ultraviolet, microwave) sensors. These techniques typically measure distances to objects by determining the time required for a pulse of sound or electromagnetic energy to bounce back from an object.   Apple's patent FIGS. 22 noted above illustrates one approach to representing a hand's volume (depth map); FIG. 24 (right) shows, in block diagram form, a two-stage gesture classifier.   User Communicating with the System   And lastly, as we noted at the top of our report, Apple's Craig Federighi, Senior VP of Software Engineering for iOS and macOS spoke about Siri's new deep learning capabilities last year. Apple's patent filing published this week also acknowledges Siri as part of this next-generation 'intelligent system.'   Under the section identified as 'User Communication with the System' Apple turns Apple notes that a microphone or other audio sensor may be used to determine if the user is attempting to make voice contact with the system. The system may use voice analysis similar to that used in Apple's SIRI intelligent assistant in order to understand user utterances and decipher those that are directed at the system.   In some embodiments, the use of voice analysis may be constant so that all user voice is analyzed to determine context and/or to identify attempts to communicate with the system.   The use of voice analysis may be augmented by the use of other sensors. A depth camera, a LIDAR, an RGB sensor, or ordinary camera images may be used to analyze user body movements in order to determine when a user's utterances are most likely directed at the system.   Rather than constantly performing voice analysis on user speech, some embodiments may only analyze a user's speech when a sensor detects that the user appears to be addressing the system (e.g., that the user is engaged).   In yet other embodiments, a particular pre-set physical user action may tell the system that the user is addressing the system, so that voice analysis may be used. For example, the user may: employ a hand gesture like a peace sign; raise a hand as in a grade school class; hold one eye shut for more than a few seconds; or perform any reasonably distinct physical action.   In a similar fashion, the voice analysis may be constantly monitoring the scene but looking for a key word or words to trigger a communication session with a user. For example, the voice analysis may scan for the name Siri, or "hey Siri."   In any event, once the system recognizes that the user desires to communicate, the communication can take place in any known manner. Differing embodiments of the invention may employ voice recognition or gesture recognition or a combination of both techniques.   Apple's patent application was filed back in Q3 2015. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

Tech Apple Science Cars Baselworld 2017 Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     All The Hottest Rumors About The Apple IPhone 8 In One Place Posted: Apr 2 2017, 11:05am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Apple     The next generation iPhone, expected for a 2017 release, will mark 10 years of iPhone - it will be special. Apple is definitely not going to miss the tenth birthday of arguably the most demanded smartphone series in the world: the iPhone. The best way to celebrate an anniversary of a smartphone is to imprint the history in a ceremonial smartphone. iPhone 8 is expected to be the ceremonial model which will imprint the tenth anniversary of iPhone in the history. Don't Miss: Today's Electronics Bargains at Woot.com The iPhone 8 is most-definitely going to be stuffed with latest technology features and high-end components. Read this article till the end to find out all the features and specifications iPhone 8 will be packing. Of course, most of the content is based on rumors and leaks, as the smartphone is set to release in the second half of this year, but still, information in this article is based on the most reliable resources, and will often be updated. The latest news suggests that iPhone 8 will feature plastic OLED display, meaning that the iPhone 8 will most probably be curved. Samsung Display will manufacture the display OLEDs for iPhone 8’s display, and is expected to produce almost 100 million units of those. iPhone 8 may feature a peculiar set of edges: Some of the rumors suggesting that the iPhone 8 will feature a curved-edge screen are now becoming more frequent and from more reliable sources. Don’t get confused though, iPhone is definitely not turning into Samsung’s flagship models entirely. The reports state that iPhone 8 will in fact, feature a flat OLED screen, while the screen then enters into a slight curve on both the edges. The curve will be so small that it might not even serve any purpose individually. But the glossy reflection due to a curve and almost no side-bezels in the line of sight means that the upcoming monster will look even more futuristic and while providing a smooth visual experience. It may be possible that the reports stating these facts might be mentioning a prototype iPhone 8 model which Apple may have decided to explore. If so, there will also surely be another prototype with longer curves and even some functionality. After all, Apple is widely known to experiment all the possible builds for any of its upcoming device. Stay in sync with us as there is going to be solid information released on thiss matter soon.  Will The Tenth Anniversary Edition Be Called iPhone 8? A recent report from Macotakara states that the anniversary edition may be named “iPhone Edition” instead of iPhone 8. Leaks from different reliable sources claim that the anniversary edition model of iPhone will be made available after the releases of iPhone 7s and 7s Plus models. All three of this year’s iPhone releases are expected to be made in the same event. A pattern can be detected when studying the names of iPhone models since the famous iPhone 4s. Since iPhone 4, the ‘s’ model of the current iPhone is released the very next year of the original iPhone model release. For instance, iPhone 4s was released in 2011, one year after iPhone 4s (2010), and the iPhone 5s was released in 2013 while iPhone 5 hit the stores in 2012. Apple may not necessarily follow tradition this time, this year is too special for Apple, no one can be certain until an official news is released. As far as expectations are concerned, it might be possible that Apple releases iPhone 8 this year while iPhone 7s and 7s Plus are discarded, or maybe the tenth anniversary edition of iPhone could be named “iPhone X”, anything is possible. Is a Tenth Anniversary iPhone “Plus” Also Possible? Could be, Apple started the tradition of Plus editions since the release of iPhone 6. The pattern followed all the way through iPhone 6s and iPhone 7, and if iPhone 7s is expected, it’s expected to arrive with a 7s Plus. But there is still the exception that makes us unsure. If Apple follows the pattern, we will enjoy a larger-screen version of iPhone 8, while if Apple wants to keep the legacy of iPhone 8 unshared, it could do that. Release Date: Either its coincidental, or Apple likes to drop patterns for iPhone enthusiasts to study and expect the future plans of Apple for iPhone. Every iPhone model from the iPhone 5 has been announced in an special event. The mentioned special events are held on Wednesdays of Tuesdays in the first or second week of September. The pattern doesn’t end there, each announced iPhone from iPhone 5 has rolled out into market two Fridays after their official announcement. The only model that broke this pattern was iPhone 6s, which was launched on the first Friday after its official announcement. Coming back to our first point, either Apple carefully left these patterns for us to expect the iPhone 8 in the first week of September with the official launch on the second Friday after the announcement, or its just coincidence and iPhone 8 could be announced on any unknown date this year. TSMC to start mass production of Apple’s A11 chipsets in April: According to latest reports, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has prepared to initiate mass production of Apple’s A11 chipsets. The rumors suggest that the production will start in April. The semiconductor manufacturer will reportedly be producing over 50 million units of Apple’s new SoC before the start of July. Note that the A11 chipsets are going to be featured in the iPhone 8, the tenth anniversary model of iPhone and the traditional iterative models, iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. Although a debate goes on trying to determine whether the A11 will debut in iPhone 8 or the iPhone 7S duo. The A11 SoC’s architecture is built upon a 10nm FinFET manufacturing process. Reports suggest that A11 will be loaded with a wafer-level integrated fan-out technology. This new technology will not only improve the battery usage efficiency of the chip, but will also drastically improve the graphical performance of the device powered by this processor. 50 million more units are going to be produced by the end of 2017, which will add to the previous 50 million units produced by the end of June. TSMC has undoubtedly a huge job ahead. The schematics of A11 were reportedly completed during the mid of last year. During the same timeframe, it was rumored that TSMC will be the sole manufacturer of Apple’s A11 chipsets, which would make it two in a row. (TSMC was also the sole manufacturer of A10 chipsets) The rumors have now been confirmed, furthermore, TSMC might also be planning to stablish a manufacturing plant in USA especially to produce Apple’s chipsets, although those plans have been further delayed to 2018.  All New Design: A company as creative as Apple doesn’t wait for something to happen, it plots the future of its products quite earlier to get more time for prototyping and enhancing the end-product. iPhone in specific, is known to make an unpredictable entry in each of its iteration when we talk about design. iPhone 3G had a plastic frame, iPhone 4 had a glass back and antenna band out of nowhere, then arrived the iPhone 5 with an untraditional aspect ratio of 16:9 and sharp-square edges with rounded corners, suddenly the next iPhone had a larger display screen and rounded edges. Only iPhone 7 failed to surprise the world as it followed the same design traits as iPhone 6. Although it could be because Apple wanted the world to get completely bored with the current design so everyone would fall in love with the new design in iPhone 8. As seen in rumored renders of iPhone 8, the next model in-line is going to make a more heroic entry in terms of design. With a minimal-bezels front, virtual home button or a complete function bar, and fingerprint sensor integrated on the display screen, people will pay anything to get their hands on the upcoming iPhone 8.The back is expected to be glass, while the edges will either be stainless steel or aluminum. Color Themes: iPhone 5s, 6s, and 7, each of these models were accompanied by a completely reimagined color theme. iPhone 5s with Gold, iPhone 6s with Rose Gold, and iPhone 7 with Jet Black color theme. iPhone 8 is most-probably going to introduce another innovative color theme to signify its value in Apple’s history. A report by Macotakara suggests that a new color theme featuring red as the primary color will be available for current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, the same theme could also be an option for the upcoming iPhone models this year. Specifications: Apple’s own line of mobile chipsets – the A-series – has been featured in iPhones since 2010. Each iteration of the smartphone received a new iteration of the CPU chipset too. iPhone 8 is also expected to receive an upgraded chipset (probably A11). Secondary processors have been used often in iPhone models to handle smaller independent features in the device, like motion voice activation and big.LITTLE fusion. The A11 could be packing the processing power to not only implement these features, but also augment their capabilities and induce AI-functionality. Not to forget, the virtual function area will also be adding load to the chipset. Apple has been tirelessly working to create iPhone an “Apple-only” entity. Custom chipsets were the first step, rumors suggest that future iPhones will feature custom Apple-made Graphical Processing Units and modems. For now, it is rumored that Intel will supply the modems for iPhones released this year. iPhone 8 will feature True Tone display:  With Samsung Galaxy S8 officially announced, all the concern has now shifted on iPhone 8. Resources fight over authenticity of each other’s reports while numerous more rumors keep surfacing daily. One rumor which is unanimously agreed by most of the resources is that Apple has 3 new iPhone models in their line-up this year. iPhone 7S, iPhone 7S Plus, and the iPhone 8 (or iPhone X) being those three. Of these three, iPhone 8 is expected to be the real horseman out of these three models. Not only that, even the rumors specifically point to iPhone 8 as this year’s most advanced handset in Apple’s line-up with high-end features, top-notch performance and fancy design. For instance, the “truly bezel-less” front panel in iPhone 8 eliminates even the remotest possibilities of a physical home button, while rumors highly suggest that a function bar (or function area) will take place under the screen where the physical button used to be. Many popular analysists second these rumors of a function area feature in the upcoming iPhone 8. Barclays specifically, also highly suggests that iPhone 8 will also be featuring a “complete spectral sensing” system for its display. Those who are unclear with the terminology, the spectral sensing system is the core component required to achieve “True Tone” display. True Tone display is basically a brightness/contrast management system which inputs the light data from the environment using these sensors. The system then configures the sharpness, brightness, contrast, and temperature of the display screen to match with the lighting of the environment. It’s really an amazing feature in the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and people who have experienced it would unconditionally fall in love with iPhone 8 if it features the True Tone display.   Any Possibility Of The Fancy Smart Connector? The magnetized connectors which were introduced in iPad Pro, later spotted in the Apple MacBook Pro, could surely be a great addition to the future iterations of iPhone. Capabilities of the smart connector surpass from charging and enter into the modular arena. If a smart connector is engineered for iPhone 8, it could be used for a miniature keyboard specifically designed for iPhone 8, like a keyboard was designed specifically for iPad Pro. Speaker packs are an option, augmented cameras, 360-view VR cameras, 3D cameras, mimicking capabilities in car infotainment systems, all could be possible. Keep checking back on the article to stay up-to-date on the matter. Display: iPhone’s LCD panels with standard screen resolution have been a huge help in battery saving, making them a good choice so far. But introduction of VR-environment and specifications of Samsung and LG’s flagship models are making the current display of iPhone an obsolete one.Not to worry though, a high quantity of rumors claim that Apple will introduce the OLED display panels with 1920x1090p and 2560x1440p screen resolutions in the upcoming models of iPhone this year. Although, Apple worked really hard to develop the 3D Touch feature in iPhones’ LCD display panels. The feature could be discarded, or Apple could re-engineer the new OLED panels, or possibly even stick with the old LCD panels altogether. Digitimes has also reported that one of the iPhone model this year will feature a 5.8” AMOLED display while the other models will pack the regular LCD panels. OLED versions of future iPhone will most-probably be curved, claims Korea Herald. Such iPhones will utilize plastic, instead of glass, ultimately creating the question: “If iPhone 8 is Glass Back, well it not be the OLED version?” iPhone 8 will not adopt the True Tone System, although it did receive the DCI-P3 color mechanism, which is also implemented in iPad Pro. Still the True Tone System is a considerable short-coming for the upcoming iPhone. True Tone System measures the surrounding light and adjusts the Gamma/Contrast ratio to provide a visually smooth experience. Will iPhone 8 Be IP68 Certified? iPhone 7 was a certified IP67 model, which made it impervious to accidental and minimal exposure to water, but it is too risky to push the limits. iPhone 8 on the other hand, is highly expected to be IP68 certified. Completely waterproof (dustproof too), says the job description. Imagine diving into seawaters without any fear and photographing your friends and fellow fishes with the dual-camera you so love in iPhone 7. iPhone 8 is highly anticipated to be IP68 certified according to a report surfaced through The Korea Herald. Are Wireless Charging Rumors True? An implementation of wireless charging had been impossible through metal surfaces, which was the main reason why iPhones since the iPhone 5 couldn’t offer the wireless charging feature. Apple however, is a stubborn child. Reports stated that iPhone has been working on developing a mechanism which would offer wireless charging (inductive charging) even through metal sheets. Rumors of success followed recently, making the aluminum-back of upcoming iPhones no longer a drawback. May it be a glass back, metal, or plastic, wireless charging is now advanced enough to function through any of these surfaces. So, do expect a wireless charging feature in future iPhones. Ming-Chi Kuo, an expert analyst from KGI dropped the word that Apple is going to use a graphite sheet as a protector for the 3D display panel against the heat generated due to wireless charging. What no one else could offer, will be brought by Apple. Apple recently patented a lot of concepts suggesting that wireless charging could be conducted even from a distance. The resonant inductive coupling will allow future iPhones to charge without being placed on a pad. This technology may not be operational till the entry of 2018. Ceramic Frame, Possible? Yes, after watching the Apple Watch 2 been built inside a ceramic frame, you might want to know if iPhone 8 could also feature such material which even stronger that stainless steel. Using a ceramic frame for a device as large as a 5.5-inch iPhone is quite costly. So, fingers crossed on this one. 4K gaming in iPhone 8 will be possible by the PowerVR Furian Architecture: Imagination Technologies just received massive praise for their latest marvel, the PowerVR Furian chipset, which will be the most capable CPU chipset for mobiles till now. The most amazing news is that 4K gaming might be a possibility by this new chipset developed by Imagination Technologies. PowerVR Furian’s development was centralized to increase graphics performance and power efficiency, these traits could allow intensive applications to be able to run smoothly on future iPhones. The chip in mentioning is reportedly capable of producing 70% to 90% better performance in real-world application’s performances. This is achieved by a 35% improvement in pixel shader, 70-80% improved fill rate in comparison with the current Series7XT Plus mobile GPU based on the PowerVR Rogue architecture. The new chipset will also offer 4K video, which will ultimately make an iPhone with 4K screens possible. The 4K videos recorded by iPhone 7 are not supported by the current architecture, hence the quality of these videos is stripped-down while playing the videos on the device. With PowerVR Furian, future iPhones could be capable of supporting 4K video quality. Keep in mind that iPhone will reap most of the benefits from the development of PowerVR Furian, as Apple had its stakes in Imagination Technologies since 2008. For those who are curious, iPhone 8 will probably NOT be packing a PowerVR Furian architecture. The officials at Imagination Technologies clearly told that the Furian chips will probably be featured in mobile phones released in 2018. A “limited supply” launch of iPhone 8 expected in September: Barclays’ top analysts Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Thomas O’Malley, and Jerry Zhang claim that their computations place an iPhone 8 launch in September, though only in limited numbers. These analysts’ reports suggest that a full supply will initiate in the last quarter this year. The current lobby of industrial news groups are divided into two groups, one that harbingers that three new iPhone models will be released this year while the other suggests that only two new models will be seen in the launch event. The latter is the traditional pattern for Apple, but a tenth anniversary isn’t a common year. The group suggesting three models to be released this year unanimously agrees the third model to be a top-notch model as a celebration for iPhone’s tenth anniversary. If an iPhone 8 is expected (also referred to as iPhone Pro, iPhone Edition, and iPhone X), it will be loaded with high-end features like an in-screen fingerprint scanner, more powerful battery, wireless charging, virtual home button and a function area, bezel less design, and much more. Barclays’ analysts side with the group expecting three new models. They highly-expect a third model to be launched, which would be better than any iPhone models till now. But the analysts also suggest that the third iPhone will be limited in supply and will take weeks between shipment and pre-order. This story may contain affiliate links.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Samsung is spending $9 billion on the iPhone Chris Smith @chris_writes April 2nd, 2017 at 12:00 PM Share Tweet Samsung is pretty upbeat about the Galaxy S8, its first major mobile test after the massive Galaxy Note 7 debacle. While the Galaxy S8 will bring in a ton of cash, Samsung is also be pretty excited about the iPhone 8’s arrival this year, which will be the first Apple smartphone to sport an OLED screen. Don't Miss: Using my iPhone for the next six months is really, really going to suck A new report from South Korean news site The Investor says Samsung Display is going forward with its plans to expand its OLED production. The company will spend 10 trillion won ($8.9 billion) this year alone on the expansion, according to the site’s sources. Apple’s decision to move to OLED technology is likely what motivated Samsung Display to go ahead with this massive investment. Apple still continues to set the tone in the mobile market, and other phone makers are expected to follow its “lead” in the near future. Samsung, however, has been using OLED screens in its Galaxy-branded handsets for years, while Apple pushed LCD technology to its limits in its iPhones. The OLED displays in recent Galaxy S and Galaxy Note models have received rave reviews, offering superior performance when compared with same-year iPhone rivals. Samsung currently has more than 95% of the market, and that’s why Apple chose Samsung Display as a supplier for its OLED iPhones. Samsung Display rivals are also investing heavily in their OLED display production lines, but Samsung has a huge advantage when it comes to overall production. Samsung is probably looking to keep Apple’s display business in the coming years and provide OLED screens to other companies as well. The report notes that Chinese smartphone makers are also seeking to utilize OLED screens in their high-end handsets in the future. Samsung is also using OLED screens in 70% of its phones, not just the high-end models. Recent reports said that Apple and Samsung inked at least two OLED display contracts for a total of 160 million OLED panels. Apple agreed to pay $4.3 billion for 60 million OLED displays, which explains why Samsung’s ready to commit so much money to upgrading its OLED production capacity.

 The smartphone is eventually going to die, and then things are going to get really crazy Matt Weinberger Apr. 2, 2017, 11:25 AM 185,984 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook AP One day, not too soon — but still sooner than you think — the smartphone will all but vanish, like beepers and fax machines before it.  Make no mistake, we're still probably at least a decade away from any kind of meaningful shift away from the smartphone. (And if we're all cyborgs by 2027, I'll happily eat my words. Assuming we're still eating at all, I guess.) Yet, piece by piece, the groundwork for the eventual demise of the smartphone is being laid by Elon Musk, by Microsoft, by Facebook, by Amazon, and a countless number of startups that still have a part to play. And, let me tell you: If and when the smartphone does die, that's when things are going to get really weird for everybody. Not just in terms of individual products, but in terms of how we actually live our everyday lives and maybe our humanity itself. Here's a brief look at the slow, ceaseless march towards the death of the smartphone — and what the post-smartphone world is shaping up to look like.  The short term People think of the iPhone and the smartphones it inspired as revolutionary devices — small enough to carry everywhere, hefty enough to handle an increasingly large number of our daily tasks, and packed full of the right mix cameras and GPS sensors to make apps like Snapchat and Uber uniquely possible.  But consider the smartphone from another perspective. The desktop PC and the laptop are made up of some combination of a mouse, keyboard, and monitor. The smartphone just took that model, shrunk it down, and made the input virtual and touch-based.  So take, for example, the Samsung Galaxy S8, unveiled this week. It's gorgeous with an amazing bezel-less screen and some real power under the hood. It's impressive, but it's more refinement than revolution. Samsung Galaxy S8 Business Insider Tellingly, though, the Galaxy S8 ships with Bixby, a new virtual assistant that Samsung promises will one day let you control every single feature and app with just your voice. It will also ship with a new version of the Gear VR virtual reality headset, developed in conjunction with Facebook's Oculus. The next iPhone, too, is said to be shipping with upgrades to the Siri assistant, along with features aimed at bringing augmented reality into the mainstream.  And as devices like the Amazon Echo, Sony PlayStation VR, and the Apple Watch continue to enjoy limited but substantial success, expect to see a lot more tech companies large and small taking more gambles and making more experiments on the next big wave in computing interfaces.  The medium term In the medium-term, all of these various experimental and first-stage technologies are going to start to congeal into something familiar, but bizarre.  Microsoft, Facebook, Google and the Google-backed Magic Leap are all working to build standalone augmented reality headsets, which project detailed 3D images straight into your eyes. Even Apple is rumored to be working on this, too. Microsoft's Alex Kipman recently told Business Insider that augmented reality could flat-out replace the smartphone, the TV, and anything else with a screen. There's not much use for a separate device sitting in your pocket or on your entertainment center, if all your calls, chats, movies, and games are beamed into your eyes and overlaid on the world around you.  Apple's AirPods keep the Siri virtual assistant in your ears. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider Meanwhile, gadgetry like the Amazon Echo or Apple's own AirPods become more and more important in this world. As artificial intelligence systems like Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Samsung's Bixby, and Microsoft's Cortana get smarter, there's going to be a rise not just in talking to computers, but having them talk back. In other words, computers are going to hijack your senses, more so than they already do, with your sight and your hearing intermediated by technology. It's a little scary. Think of what Facebook glitches could mean in a world where it doesn't just control what you read on your phone, but what you see in the world around you. The promise, though, is a world where real life and technology blend more seamlessly. The major tech companies promise that this future means a world of fewer technological distractions and more balance, as the physical and digital world become the same thing. You decide how you feel about that. The really crazy future Still, all those decade-plus investments in the future still rely on gadgetry that you have to wear on you, even if it's only a pair of glasses. Some of the craziest, most forward-looking, most unpredictable advancements go even further — provided you're willing to wait a few extra decades, that is. This week, we got our first look at Neuralink, a new company cofounded by Elon Musk with a goal of building computers into our brains by way of "neural lace," a very early-stage technology that lays on your brain and bridges it to a computer. It's the next step beyond even that blending of the digital and physical worlds, as man and machine become one.  Assuming the science works — and lots of smart people believe that it will —  this is the logical endpoint of the road that smartphones started us on. If smartphones gave us access to information and augmented reality puts that information in front of us when we need it, then putting neural lace in our brains just closes the gap. Futurist Ray Kurzweil has been predicting our cyborg futures for a long time now. Tech Insider Musk has said that this is because the rise of artificial intelligence — which underpins a lot of the other technologies, including voice assistants and virtual reality — means that humans are going to have to augment themselves just to keep up with the machines. If you're really curious about this idea, futurist Ray Kurzweil is the leading voice on the topic.  The idea of man/machine fusion is a terrifying one, with science fiction writers, technologists, and philosophers alike having very good cause to ask what even makes us human in the first place. At the same time, the idea is so new that nobody really knows what this world would look like in practice. So if and when the smartphone dies, it'll actually be the end of an era in more ways than one. It'll be the end of machines that we carry with us passively and the beginning of something that bridges our bodies straight into the ebb and flow of digital information. It's going to get weird.  And yet, lots of technologists already say that smartphones give us superpowers with access to knowledge, wisdom, and abilities beyond anything nature gave us. In some ways, augmenting the human mind would be the ultimate superpower. Then again, maybe I'm just an optimist. Get the latest Google stock price here.

Our in-house options expert gives listeners Options 101: what options are, how they work, and how investors can use them in their portfolios. Motley Fool Staff Apr 2, 2017 at 10:44AM Have you been interested in options, but are unsure about how to take the first step to figuring them out? In this clip, Motley Fool Options expert JP Bennett gives a beginner's intro into what options are and how they work. There are only a few basics to options, and once you've mastered them, a world of new investing opportunities will open up to you. Watch this clip to learn the difference between calls and puts, what they mean for options investors, how investors might layer them together in an options strategy, and more. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on March 24, 2017. Dylan Lewis: To kick us off, what are options? JP Bennett: In a nutshell, options are what are referred to as derivative instruments. They derive their value based on something else. In this case, it's the underlying stock. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) options are going to have a value based on where the stock of Apple is trading at a given time. And although I think most listeners will know that there are a myriad of options strategies with crazy names and a bunch of different options positions, it might seem like there's so much to learn. But if you boil it down, there are really only two options you can use. There's calls and there's puts. Calls benefit when a stock rises. Puts benefit when a stock falls. And you can either buy or sell them. So, there's really only a couple of basics that you just have to master, and then the world opens up and you have a myriad of possibilities, in terms of strategies that you can do. Lewis: Yeah. And you get into that complexity when you start layering these different options together. So, how do they work, and what are the different elements that people need to focus on? Because, at the end of the day, these are really contracts, right? Bennett: Yes. They're derivative instruments, but they enable you to use leverage. Every options contract represents the right to control 100 shares of a given stock. One Apple call contract represents the right to buy 100 shares of Apple. So, they really have the potential to leverage your returns, or leverage your losses. So, when you're using strategies, you have to be mindful of that. So if you look at a hypothetical company, the stock is trading at $100, if you own a call with a strike price -- just to double back, a strike price is the price that is specific to the option that you either buy or sell, and that's the pivot point for where the value is derived. The stock is trading at $100, you buy a call contract with a strike price of $100, that means that you have the right to buy shares at the price of $100, regardless of where the stock is trading at expiration. The stock could double and be at $200 at expiration. You still get to buy shares for $100. So, that's where your profit comes from. If the stock is trading at $100 and you buy a call contract with the strike price of $90, then you get the right to buy those shares at $90. For every stock, there is specific expiration dates. Within that expiration date, there are a bunch of different strike prices. It will depend based on where the stock is trading, how liquid it is, and things like that. So, you can tailor the strategy to suit your needs. Lewis: If you're looking at a call option, and that is, if you're going to go long, the opportunity to buy a stock at a predetermined price, what you're really looking at here is the exercise price, the duration, and then the premium that you're paying for that contract. That's the fee that you're paying for the optionality. Bennett: If you want to get into the weeds in terms of how options are priced, there are really only a few matters that really determine the price. Like you said, the strike price in relation to the stock price. The implied volatility -- so, a stock that really doesn't do much, it just meanders along, the odds of it moving significantly from where it currently is is pretty low, so the premium that you just mentioned that you will have to pay for that isn't very high. You have to worry about the risk-free rate -- though, in current environments, you really don't have to, because it doesn't have much of an influence. And, you have to worry about how long the option will be alive for, so to speak, because they are instruments that have a finite life period. So, you can buy options for some stocks that expire at the end of the week. In some cases, you can buy ones that go out up to two years. So, there are just a few things that you really have to have a handle on to make sure. I don't really think we have time to get into the weeds in terms of pricing and determining whether or not you're getting a fair price. But, there are really only a few factors that you have to focus in on. Lewis: We talked about calls, do you want to talk a little bit about puts as well? Bennett: Yep. Puts. If you think about, specifically, put writing, that's actually one of our bread-and-butter strategies in Motley Fool Options. If you think about it, put writing, whereas calls benefit when the stock goes up, puts benefit when the stock goes down. So, if you're bearish on a stock, you could buy puts. But actually, what we prefer to do is sell puts. When you're selling a put, you're going to bring in that income. If you buy an option, you have to pay for that right to either sell shares at a given price or buy shares at a given price. When you sell an option, you're taking, essentially, the other side of that trade. So, you're being compensated for that. If you sell a call, you may have to sell shares at the strike price. Because we don't know where the stock is going to end up, you're going to get paid a premium for essentially taking on that risk. When you sell puts, you're basically saying, "Maybe the stock falls below the strike price. We don't really know, so I'm going to require you to pay me a premium in order for me to take on that risk from you." So, if you want to think about it, one of the best analogies is probably, you're an insurance company in this case, you don't really know what's going to happen, but you can help someone in terms of protecting them from a stock falling. In order to protect them, to provide that insurance, you have to be compensated. If you buy auto insurance, they don't just provide you that insurance for free, you have to pay them for them to be willing to take on that risk. So, basically, in the case of writing puts, you find stocks that you really like, you find a strike price that you're OK with buying shares at, and you make sure you're getting fairly compensated in terms of the premium that you'll collect. And you basically become the insurance company for the person who's taking the other side of that trade. Lewis: And the logic with that is, you would be buying these shares at a price that's lower than the current market value. So, because it's a company you like anyway, you're willing to, say, buy it at $90 three months from now, even though it's trading at only $100. Bennett: Yeah. Go back to Apple, it's around $140, it's like, "$135 is a great price for Apple. It's not there yet. I would buy it as soon as it hits that. But in the meantime, I'm going to collect some income by selling puts at that strike price. If it gets there, great, I'll get those shares. If not, at least I'll have generated some income while I'm waiting for that to happen." Dylan Lewis owns shares of Apple. JP Bennett owns shares of Apple.

Tech Insider BI Intelligence Events Trending Tech Insider Finance Politics Strategy Life Sports Video All × From To You have successfully emailed the post. I just switched to Apple Music after two years of Spotify Premium — and so far, I'm not impressed Nick Vega Apr. 2, 2017, 11:00 AM 13,786 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple I joined Spotify during my sophomore year of college. For awhile, I enjoyed the playlists and didn’t mind listening to the ads every now and again. But once I was back home in New York City for the summer and away from the plentiful campus WiFi, I found myself burning through data. After a few weeks of warnings from Verizon that I was approaching my data limit, I decided to take the plunge and become a Spotify Premium member. For more than two years, I enjoyed my ad-free listening experience, and I made the most of my Premium membership. But everything changed a month ago when I decided to de-link my Facebook account from my Spotify. I thought it would be a simple process, but no matter how hard I looked, I couldn’t find any way to do it. Eventually, I reached out to the Spotify support team, and they informed me that since I had created my account using my Facebook login, it was impossible to de-link the two. The only solution, I was told, was to delete my Spotify account and create a new one. So that’s what I did. They gave me credit for a free month of Premium to make up for the time that was left on my other account, and transferred all my songs and playlists over for me. For one reason or another, once my month of Premium was almost up and Spotify started asking me for my credit card information, I got cold feet. After two years with one streaming service, it was time to see what else was out there. This week, I signed up for Spotify’s biggest rival: Apple Music. Here are my first impressions. View As: One Page Slides The user interface is confusing Nick Vega When Apple Music first came out in summer 2015, I did the three-month free trial but I ditched the app after the first day because it was just a headache to use. However, the introduction of iOS 10 brought about a redesign of Apple Music, and I was ready to give it another shot. Though the interface is now much better than I remembered, there is still a learning curve. Unlike Spotify, which brings you to its home screen full of playlists and albums when you open the app, Apple Music starts you at your library. In my case, my library was empty, and I had to figure out how to fill it. Finding a song I liked was easy enough; Apple Music’s search feature brought me the results I wanted whether I searched for songs, albums, or artists. But confusion set in when I tried to save a song to my device for offline listening. I first tried to save the songs by clicking the "+" icon, but I got a pop-up notification that told me I needed to set up my iCloud library in order to add the song. I don’t normally use iCloud, so I declined the notification, and kept looking for an option to save songs for offline play. I eventually gave up and contacted Apple support, which proceeded to tell me that I had no option but to enable iCloud. Once I did, however, I was filling my library in no time. I have yet to spend enough time in the app to judge how good it is at recommending new music — Spotify’s Discover Weekly playlist sets the bar very high — but first looks are promising, and the curated playlists definitely make me want to listen. Why is everything so large? Nick Vega The very first thing I noticed when I opened Apple Music was that everything is huge now. The album covers, photos, and video stills take up huge chunks of the screen, and the font is enormous. Seriously, it’s really, really big. It’s large to the point where it just seems like some higher-up at Apple approached Apple Music’s designers and told them to design the app as if their core audience was older people who bring reading glasses to restaurants so they can see the menu. Don’t get me wrong, everything looks really nice. You can say a lot about Apple and their products, but you can’t say that they aren’t beautiful. Compared to Spotify’s relatively bare-bones design, Apple Music is a joy to scroll through and explore. But jeez everything is big. That said, I'm not ready to jump ship yet Apple Music is a flawed app. With the Apple pedigree and competition from Spotify, I was expecting a more positive experience from my first few days. But unlike my first go-around with this streaming service, I haven't gotten the urge to throw my hands up and go back to the familiar.  The curated playlists and recommended music sections are visually appealing and make me curious to jump in and listen. And the promise of Apple Music exclusives, if only for a few weeks at a time, has also caught my interest.  Despite the fact that it isn't as user-friendly as other music apps, I want to give it a chance to win me over. I'm going to spend more time with it over the coming weeks. Time will tell if it can make a convert out of me.  SEE ALSO: Apple just released a huge new update for iPhones — here's what’s new More: Features Apple Apple Music Spotify streaming music Spotify Premium Music services facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru I just switched to Apple Music after two years of Spotify Premium — and so far, I'm not impressed I just switched to Apple Music after two years of Spotify Premium — and so far, I'm not impressed I joined Spotify during my sophomore year of...

X How to . . . secure your iCloud account Apple has rubbished claims that hackers can access your account, but it’s still good to tighten your security about 16 hours ago Ciara O'Brien Reusing the same password on multiple accounts is a big no-no when it comes to security. Photograph: iStock         Have you heard the claims from a hacking group that they have details of more than 200 million iCloud accounts? If they don’t get a ransom within a few days, the story goes, they’ll wipe the iCloud accounts, and possibly the Apple devices associated with them. It’s not clear how true the claims are. Apple has already rubbished reports that its service has been in any way compromised, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take precautions. In fact, now is a good time to have a look at your account’s security and make a few changes. Check your password strength: Consider changing your password. The basic logic for choosing one is: easy for you to remember, hard for others to guess. Steer clear of obvious passwords, such as your date of birth, your child’s name, and so on. If you use the bare minimum for passwords using all lowercase letters, you are putting your information at risk. The longer and more complex your password is, the harder it is to guess. You could use a sentence or phrase as a password, and swap some letters out for numbers, add a capital letter and a symbol. Most online services will force you to have a password that is a mix of numbers and letters; others take it a step further and insist on a capital letter or two, or possibly a symbol. Microsoft Ireland reports pre-tax profits of almost €1bn Wave goodbye to the anonymous Twitter egg Reality bites as Oculus Rift inventor moves on from Facebook You could also use a password manager such as Dashlane, or 1Password to help create strong passwords and also give you somewhere to store them. That comes with its own risks – storing all your passwords with one service – but at the very least it will help you get in the habit of creating stronger passwords to protect yourself. And while we’re at it, reusing the same password on multiple accounts is a big no-no when it comes to security. If your details for one site are compromised, the rest of your services are at risk. Enable two-factor authentication: The easiest way to keep someone out of your accounts is to bring in an extra layer of security through two-factor authentication. Apple brought two-factor authentication in to iOS 9 and El Capitan in 2015; prior to that it offered two-step verification, a slightly older technology, in use since 2013. Two-step verification uses four-digit codes sent to your trusted numbers and has a recovery key that you need to note down and keep safe in case you get locked out of your accounts. Two-factor authentication is recommended for those who have iOS devices running iOS 9 or later, or OS X El Capitan or later; two-step verification is good for devices that are earlier than this and cannot be upgraded. Regardless of the method, once you’ve enabled two-factor security, you’ll have to have access to your nominated mobile number or device, or you’ll be unable to log into your account. How it works: once you enable two-factor authentication, you’ll have to provide a code to log in to your account for the first time on new devices. On new browsers, you can opt not be asked for the code after the initial log in, but that’s not recommended if you share a device, or use a public PC. No code means no access, keeping unauthorised users out. To enable two-factor authentication through your iPhone or iPad running iOS 9 or later: Open Settings>iCloud and select your Apple ID at the top of the screen. Select Password and security. Tap Two-factor authentication to turn it on. You’ll be prompted to set a password. To enable it on your Mac with OS X El Capitan or later: Go to Apple menu >System Preferences >iCloud >Account Details. Click Security, then turn on Two-Factor Authentication.       Topics: Apple Read More Not quite so Luckey?

But Which? has discovered that the battery life claimed by laptop manufacturers rarely lives up to reality, with our tests finding it often falls drastically short. Which? testing has shown that almost all laptop manufacturers overstate their battery claims. In some cases, the battery life estimates were double what we achieved in our lab testing. Laptop reviews – Read our latest laptop reviews, from brands such as Apple, Dell, HP and Lenovo. Manufacturer claims vs reality We’ve compared the stated manufacturer claims against our laptop tests over the past year, comparing 67 models. Overall we found that manufacturers are missing their claims not by minutes, but by hours. The most optimistic laptop manufacturers are overstating their battery life by 50% or more, leaving you searching for the power cable twice as often as you’d expect. It’s not all bad news, however – our tests found that with Apple MacBooks, you could meet or even exceed the claimed battery life, according to Apple. Laptop batteries: What we found We test laptops for battery life while actively browsing the web over wi-fi, running the laptop in this fashion until the battery is fully drained. In the graphic above, we show the average claimed battery life for all the laptops we’ve tested since January 2016, versus the average battery life in our tests. Number of laptops tested: Acer (8); Apple (3), Asus (8), Dell (10), HP (12), Lenovo (20), Toshiba (6). The Which? battery test Each laptop we judge goes through our battery tests at least three times. We don’t simply trust battery capacity claims: we actually drain the whole battery from start to finish, several times over, during various tasks. One test involves watching films until the battery finally shuts down, another continually browsing websites over wi-fi. We believe that that these tests are representative of the real world use that a laptop would get. As the figures we arrived at are often drastically different to the manufacturer claims, we have to wonder how their own estimates are arrived at. Below are some examples of the sorts of discrepancies our testing unveiled: Lenovo Yoga 510 Claimed battery life: 5 hours Which? tests: 2 hours, 7 minutes Apple MacBook Pro 13  Claimed battery life: 10 hours Which? tests: 12 hours HP Pavilion 14-al115na Claimed battery life: 9 hours Which? tests: 4 hours 25 minutes Dell Inspiron 15 5000 Claimed battery life: 7 hours Which? tests: 3 hours 58 minutes Acer E15  Claimed battery life: 6 hours Which? tests: 2 hours 56 minutes Which? reached out to laptop manufacturers and asked why there were such big differences in their claims and our findings. Dell told us ‘It’s difficult to give a specific battery life expectation that will directly correlate to all customer usage behaviours because every individual uses their PC differently – it’s similar to how different people driving the same car will get different gas mileage depending on how they drive.’ HP said that is battery tests ‘uses real life scripts and runs on real applications like Microsoft office.‘, and that the exact specifications, such as screen resolution, will impact the results for each model. It’s vital to look past manufacturer claims and dig a little deeper to find out what kind of battery life you can really expect from your laptop. We test like no one else, so check our full laptop reviews for the Which? verdict on laptop battery life.

(Apple) By Hayley Tsukayama, The Washington Post Published: April 2, 2017, 6:05 AM A   A Apple announced several new products Tuesday morning, including a cheaper version of the iPad and a new red shade for the iPhone. Consumers could start placing their orders for the new devices Friday. If you’ve been thinking about treating yourself to something new and are intrigued by Apple’s announcements, here are some things to consider before you buy. The strongest selling point for the new 9.7-inch iPad is its price. The tablet now starts at $329, which is $70 less than its previous price. It has a retina display and comes in three colors: gold, silver and space gray. The new iPad appears to be a replacement for the iPad Air 2, so it’s best to think of it as a successor to that product — an in-between, easy-to-carry tablet for watching video and web browsing. It is about 20 percent thicker than its predecessor but is still pretty trim at 1.03 pounds. The lower price tag comes with a few trade-offs, however. It doesn’t have Apple’s latest processor but packs the same one from the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, meaning that it is a little slower than the latest iPhone. The new tablet also has no support for the Apple Pencil or Apple’s Smart Keyboard — those appear to still be reserved for the iPad Pro line. That will probably be fine for most people. Apple also upped the storage space on the iPad mini to 128 GB, for $399, which could make the smaller tablet more appealing as a travel companion for watching video — if you don’t mind the price. The smaller size makes it a little more plane-friendly than a full-size tablet. As for the new red iPhone, deciding whether to pay $749 for it is almost entirely a cosmetic decision. The anodized red hue is a head-turner and benefits the AIDS awareness campaign Red. Apple has already put a similar color on its iPods, but this is the first time it has come to the iPhone. If you’re really digging the color or if you are an AIDS research supporter, those are the reasons to buy. There’s no difference in the actual hardware, so you won’t be upgrading anything apart from your style.

The timing might hand Samsung’s Galaxy S8 an advantage in terms of being first to market, but it means that to basic smartphone elements, such as the removal of the physical home key. Although this will be from the bottom bezel, this innovation from Apple is one that is well used throughout the Android ecosystem. It has typically been seen as a move to keep costs down in the mid- to low-range handsets where software can replicate the buttons on-screen. It has become a popular option in the more expensive handsets, and today say Samsung make the same decision on the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus as it moved towards an on-screen home button. On one hand, Apple is going to be seen (once more) being late to the party and following the same trend as the rest of the industry when it removes the home button from the iPhone. On the other hand Apple is looking to solve a particular pain point that weakens the user interaction model, at least for its own community fans. Popular Searches Suncorp Group Ltd SNMYF ▲ 9.95 +0.14 +1.43% Hawaiian Holdings Inc HA ▼ 46.45 -0.25 -0.54% A cursory examination of the Galaxy S8 shows that the fingerprint sensor for Samsung’s flagship has been from the front of the device to an area beside the camera lens on the rear. While this is a solution many manufacturers have followed, it does feel a touch ungainly and requires a certain amount of flex in the average non-dominant hand to reach the sensor. Apple may be behind the curve in some design cues, but it has a far more elegant idea for biometric security in the iPhone 8. © Provided by Forbes Media LLC iPhone 8 concept render (Image: Oscar Luna Martinez) This year’s flagship is expected to use a different style of TouchID sensor altogether. A patent spotted by 9to5Mac talks about the use of ‘discrete ultrasonic transducers’. While the obvious placement is in a physical button assembly, the patent also details techniques that would allow the sensor to be placed under a display. Which would be perfect way for Tim Cook and his to both follow a trend, add a bit of magic, and no doubt light up the buzzword bingo cards and talk about fingerprint unlocking “in a way that only Apple can do.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Following Samsung’s introduction of the Galaxy S8 yesterday, the report notes that based on current supply chain intel Apple’s OLED is expected to be less curved than the S8 and therefore less of a so-called edge-to-edge “infinity” display: The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac While Apple’s new OLED form factor looks similar, current indications are for less use of curved OLED which may result in a slightly less “infinity” screen form factor. Building on reports that the iPhone’s price tag could increase to $1000 or more this year, Hall anticipates the average selling price of the entire next iPhone line to expand as the expected high-end OLED model hits an approximately $1000 ASP. The report doesn’t, however, offer specifics on which models or by how much the rest of the line could increase on average. The note also backs up previous reports that the iPhone models will remain with a 3GB RAM configuration on the high-end, and that NAND Flash providers and other suppliers are expected to “benefit from the potential content increase in the upcoming iPhone.” Hall notes that his forecast for the expected “iPhone supercycle” is now at 260mn units in 2018 up from its previous estimate of 245mn. That, as the report points out, is versus a consensus at 225mn. “We have raised our FY18 iPhone forecast to 260mn units (vs. consensus at 225mn) from 245mn units, driven by a strong feature upgrade and robust replacement demand, with the installed base at 1.1bn units. With a ~$1,000 ASP for the OLED model, we also anticipate ASP expansion in the next iPhone cycle.” In a note earlier this week, Hall said that the anticipated higher Phone 8 price would help control high demand for new camera features and a major physical redesign expected for the device while offsetting Apple’s increased bill of materials.

By Christopher Morris on April 2, 2017 8:10 am in Technology ShareTweetPostFlip As the dust settles on the unveiling of the Galaxy S8, fans of Apple devices are beginning to wonder what the Samsung flagship means for the future of the iPhone range. There is no doubt that the iPhone 8 will take its lead from the Korean company to some extent, and there could be critical clues contained within the Galaxy S8’s portfolio of features. Bixby contest Samsung itself has already responded to the iPhone range by including its new virtual assistant Bixby. Whether the new software will be the equal of Siri remains to be seen, but Samsung clearly felt that the Galaxy S8 would be lacking an important feature without this addition. However, the early indications are that Bixby will not deliver the same level of functionality as Siri. This presents Apple with an excellent opportunity to widen the gap further still when the iPhone 8 is released, and this could even feature as a major part of its marketing campaign. Wraparound display Aside from Bixby, the other obvious innovation in the Galaxy S8 is the inclusion of a wraparound display, with the screen in the device extending right to the edge of the handset. The concept of the wraparound display will to some extent define the consumer technology marketplace in 2017, with Samsung having successfully revolutionized the mobile sphere. It is not that long ago that a curved screen smartphone was unheard of; now Samsung has released a major new range without any flatscreen mobile whatsoever. It is the display of the Galaxy S8 that perhaps provides the biggest clue to the makeup of the iPhone 8. If Apple was already likely to instigate some sort of significant redesign of the iPhone concept in 2016, it now seems absolutely certain. Samsung has staked the reputation of its flagship on curved screen technology, and Apple risks looking dated and somewhat left behind if the iPhone 8 does not follow suit. Curved screen debut Certainly, the inclusion of curved screen technology has been widely anticipated in the iPhone 8, and an Apple patent delivering precisely this design feature is hardly a secret. But Apple has prided itself as a setter of trends rather than a follower, while its design excellence is almost intrinsically associated with the brand. This could mean that the Californian corporation considers veering away from the trend for curved screens, but it seems far more likely that the iPhone 8 will feature at least one curved model, and seriously slimmed down bezels. Nonetheless, the effort that Samsung has made to redefine what the Galaxy S8 delivers has placed a certain onus on Apple to deliver something outstanding with the iPhone 8. Having witnessed the Galaxy S8 unveiling event, Christopher Voce of Forrester Research believes that the ball is firmly in Apple’s court. “I think it does put a lot of pressure on Apple to show that they can still innovate. Certainly Apple remains the one to beat,” Voce commented. Wireless charging It also seems probable that Apple will respond to the Galaxy S8 by introducing wireless charging. This is a new feature that has been strongly linked with the next generation iPhone, and again Apple could be deemed rather dated in its approach if it fails to deliver this once more. Also, there is a particular kicker for the Cupertino-based company here, as it is noted that Apple has some revolutionary technology up its sleeve that enables iPhone units to be charged from a distance of 15 feet. This could enable Apple to get the jump on a Samsung in this department. Home button Meanwhile, it is ironic that Samsung has blinked first with the removal of the Home button from the Galaxy S8, as it has been almost ubiquitously suggested that Apple will indeed do this with the iPhone 8. So this is another change that we can very strongly bank on when the iPhone 8 is revealed. Resolution After Samsung, perhaps somewhat surprisingly, increased the resolution in the Galaxy S8, Apple must surely follow suit with the iPhone 8. With the consumer electronics giant yet to release a full HD smartphone, the very least expectation from consumers will be that Apple will indeed ensure that the iPhone 8 can display full HD content. This would make the larger version of the iPhone 8 range quad HD, which would put it virtually on a par with the Galaxy S8. Screen size Aside from this, there will also be pressure on Apple to increase the size of the display, as has indeed been suggested previously. Rumors have tended to indicate that the Californian company is considering releasing three iPhone 8 models in 2017, and the largest of these will probably have a display of similar size to the Galaxy S8. Whether Apple will go as far as imitating the 6.2-inch screen included in the Galaxy S8 Plus is highly doubtful. What can be said for certain if that the company has traversed a considerable distance from the vision of Steve jobs, with the founder and former CEO of the company having believed that 3.5-inches is the ideal smartphone screen size! Augmented reality With Samsung having invested heavily in virtual reality with the Galaxy S8, via 360-degree camera functionality, Apple will probably follow suit with some augmented reality upgrades. CEO Tim Cook has already earmarked this as an important part of the iPhone series in the future, and work will almost certainly be going on behind the scenes to ensure that this is integrated into the iPhone range this year. New photo As speculation begins to grow on the next generation iPhone 8, a new leak provides a mockup photograph of the iPhone 8, displaying the device from both the front and back of the units. This image suggests that the iPhone 8 will feature a fingerprint scanner placed on the rear of the device, with the Home button being eliminated and the size of the screen significantly extended. There are obvious similarities between this approach and that of the Galaxy S8, meaning that Samsung is beginning to have a big influence over the way that Apple thinks about its product range.

Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat The numbers for the iPad aren’t good. Revenue and unit sales were both down again, as usual. But that does not mean Apple has given up on its tablet. First Apple fleshed out the product line with two high-end iPad Pro models. Now it has gone and built a low-end version, with a fairly big 9.7-inch screen, a recent A9 chip, and a minimum of 32GB of storage. Most importantly, it’s got a low, low starting price: $329. That price is so important to the identity of this product that it’s mentioned on its online product description page as if it were a feature. The only other modern Apple device that has that characteristic is the MacBook Air, which was last updated two years ago and now serves as the bottom of the Mac laptop lineup, given the arrival of the 12-inch MacBook and the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Apple ran this same playbook last year, when it introduced the iPhone SE, a throwback to the cute 4-inch 2013 iPhone 5S. The SE, at $399, is the poor man’s iPhone, if such a thing is possible. Demand exceeded supply for the first two quarters following its release, suggesting that people had been eager for a cheaper Apple phone for some time. Now we have the 2017 iPad, which looks essentially the same as the iPad Air 2 from 2014. Generally speaking, it has performed well for the price in my early testing. Is it as zippy as the iPad Pro? No. Can you use the great Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard with this thing? No. Does it come in pink rose gold? Nah. What you have here is a good enough iPad available on the cheap. Apple wouldn’t be coming out with this product if it didn’t think the value proposition would resonate. The iPhone SE has succeeded in getting people to switch from Android, and this new iPad could do the same. And it’s not only that. Particularly in the education market, which Apple has focused on with the Mac in the past, the new iPad could take some market share from Chromebooks. Google’s partners have put out many low-end models, and now Apple has a better response to that challenge. Regardless of whether you’re in the classroom, though, a lower-priced iPad could make you more willing to spend money on accessories, like cases, keyboards, and stylii — because the price of everything simply won’t be as staggeringly high. That might be exactly what Apple wants. The question is whether this is all enough to make the iPad business grow beyond its high point in 2013.

While tickets are free, you can buy a “hero ticket” for $300 that guarantees entry. CocoaConf Next Door: June 5-8 2017 -- Taking place alongside WWDC — literally next door — CocoaConf Next Door is a four-day developer conference covering all things Swift, iOS and macOS. Early bird registration is $999 until 28 April 2017, when the full schedule is expected to be announced. Confirmed speakers are Jean MacDonald of App Camp for Girls, author Daniel Steinberg, author Rob Napier, and Khan Academy developer Laura Savino. Layers: June 5-7 2017 -- A conference for designers, Layers is described as “like a party, but for learning.” This three-day conference will take place at the Montgomery Theater, across from WWDC. Details have yet to be announced, but tickets cost $850 each. MacDeployment: June 8–9 2017 -- A two-day conference starting on June 8th at the University of Calgary in Canada, MacDeployment is dedicated to the best practices in Mac deployment and maintenance.

Speakers will include Chuck Joiner of MacVoices, developer Brett Terpstra, and Allison Sheridan of Nosillacast, among a variety of other well-known members of the Apple media and user group world. Refreshingly, Macstock is aimed at Apple enthusiasts of all experience levels, making it one of the few conferences that’s open to the everyday Apple user who just wants to learn more and hobnob with like-minded people. Sessions are identified as being appropriate for beginners or intermediate users. FileMaker Developer Conference: July 24–27, 2017 -- This one’s pretty specific, but since the FileMaker Developer Conference is open to the public and FileMaker is an Apple subsidiary, we’re including it. It takes place from July 24th through 27th at the JW Marriott Phoenix Desert Ridge in Phoenix. Early bird registration is $999 until 28 April 2017 after which it goes up by $100. Apple Market Forum: August 2017 -- Organized by Macworld/iWorld veteran Paul Kent and the Mac Observer co-founder Dave Hamilton, Apple Market Forum will offer “2 days of analysis, vision and insights into the dynamics, tools and technology that are defining the Apple Marketplace.” Details are sparse, but the AMF will have room for only 350 attendees so you’ll want sign up on the priority registration list to stay in the loop. iOSDevCampDC: August 4, 2017 -- iOSDevCampDC is a one-day “unconference” for iOS developers that will take place in McLean, VA.

The keynote speaker will be Scott Bolton, a NASA astrophysicist and author of “Destination: Jupiter.” Other speakers will include the Apple Distinguished Educator Jason LaMar, Denise Clifton of Tandemvines Publishing, and author Luke Asa Guidici. Release Notes: October 16–18, 2017 -- While many conferences aimed at Mac and iOS developers have some sessions that cover business issues, the Release Notes conference aims squarely at that topic, building in plenty of time for essential networking. Scheduled for October 16th through 18th in Chicago. Details about speakers, sessions, and registration prices aren’t yet available, but you can sign up to be alerted when they’re decided upon. Last year’s speakers included Christina Warren of Gizmodo, David Sparks of MacSparky, Stephen Hackett of Relay FM, Jaimee Newberry of MartianCraft, and Rich Siegel of Bare Bones Software. MacTrack Legal: October 19–21, 2017 -- If you’re a Mac-using lawyer, check out the MacTrack Legal conference, held at Disney World in Orlando, FL. Speakers will include Katie Floyd, an attorney who co-hosts the Mac Power Users podcast with David Sparks of MacSparky, Randy Juip, and Tom Lambotte. Sessions will cover document workflow, communicating via video, GTD productivity, automated marketing systems, best practices in case management, and intermediate to advanced PDF work.

Registration fees range from $499 to $1099, depending on when you sign up and if you’re in the education market. MacTech Conference: November 15–17, 2017 -- While the MacTech Pro events fit into a single day and travel around the country, the Los Angeles-based MacTech Conference offers attendees three days of sessions, seminars, and vendor interaction, plus pre-conference workshops and a pair of superlative evening activities. We’ve attended a number of times (see “MacTech Conference 2012 Opens Mental Doors,” 22 October 2012, “MacTech Conference 2013 Abounds with Networking and Fun,” 11 November 2013, and “Three Highlights from MacTech Conference 2015,” 9 November 2015) and recommend it to Apple IT professionals. It’s too early for there to be a list of speakers or sessions, but now is a good time to pencil MacTech Conference onto your calendar for November 15th through 17th, with pre-conference workshops on the 14th. Early bird tickets currently cost $949; the price will rise to $1599 eventually.

Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-20 19:20 Thanks, we've added it in. Reply Henry Larsen  2017-03-20 23:41 Sorry, but in this article you guys repeatedly set off a loud annoyance buzzer for me and, I expect, more than a few others. What's the problem? Well, here are a few examples: Mdevcon: ... Amsterdam, Netherlands IOSCon: ... London, England Don't all educated people (such as those who might be interested in attending a tech conference) know where Amsterdam is?!? (And it's 'the Netherlands' by the way.) If you mean Amsterdam, New York, then, OK, specify that. Otherwise the city name suffices. Likewise London. CocoaConf: ... Chicago, IL Is there even another Chicago, anywhere? App Builders Switzerland: ... Zürich, Switzerland Gosh, do you really think your readers are so stupid that they might think the App Builders _Switzerland_ conference is possibly in Zürich, Alabama? &c., &c., &c. Now, I understand that most of your readers are American and many observers have noted that Americans may be more geographically challenged than others -- but that's no reason to pander to them. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-21 09:06 From a publishing standpoint, we juggle completeness versus brevity all the time. For this article, we chose to be complete in terms of providing U.S. states or countries with the city name in most cases. I honestly wasn't paying that much attention to the place names this time around in favor of focusing on the dates and other details. Now that you point it out, it does look a little awkward, so I'll go through and trim out the obvious ones. I somehow doubt that most people know where Crystal Lake and State College are, so I'll leave those. Reply Richard Smith  2017-03-21 18:08 On that note, a consistency issue, you have the list mostly sorted by date, so I'm wondering why MacAdmins: July 11–14, 2017, is listed above X World: June 29–30, 2017.

Let us offer some steps to get things running and to help avoid paying Best Buy or Staples to tweak settings and install software. Users can do it easily without the wait. Apple offers personal setup help with a new computer, but why wait in line or waste time at the store. This may sound strange, but start by enjoying the unboxing experience. Apple spends a lot of time engineering the packaging process for a smooth and even elegant unboxing experience. See the video below to watch a MacBook Pro unboxing. Follow the steps in the video to prepare to first start-up the computer by removing plastic. Plug in the MagSafe connector that magnetically connects to the left side of the MacBook and charge it up while performing these steps. Press the start button to let it launch for the first time. First Startup of a New MacBook The first startup asks users to decide things like operating system language and keyboard, Wi-Fi or Ethernet and restoring content from another source. Pick a user interface and keyboard language and connect to Wi-Fi with the password on your network. Then choose to either set up the MacBook as a clean start or restore from one of the following: Another computer – use this if you own another Mac. Time Machine backup – use this if you backed up another Mac using Time Machine. Another hard drive – use this if you removed a hard drive from another Mac and want to use it plugged into a USB adapter like the one here. Windows PC – use if you’re switching from a Windows computer and want to transfer personal files and data. After restoring content, enter an Apple ID/password or create a new one. Here’s one big decision to make. Many users actually use two Apple accounts. They share one with the family so everyone can use the apps purchased through the account. They create a separate Apple account for iCloud to back up personal information like contacts, calendar, email and settings like bookmarks and Internet accounts. Choose to either use one account for everything or separate accounts for situations like the one described here. For those using two accounts, pick the one intended for personal information and iCloud backup and enter that during first boot, not the one for buying apps and media. Enter the other information later. Set up Find My Mac to help if the Mac gets lost or stolen. Agree to terms of service twice and then create a new user account on the computer. This is different from the Apple ID used for either iCloud or buying media and apps. This user account creates a folder on the storage drive to hold personal files, programs and customizations for this computer. A password protects the content and the user will enter the password when he or she logs onto the computer. We suggest using something like your name. The system then lets the user set time zone info and whether to use iCloud Keychain. Click here to learn more about the Keychain and how to set things up. We recommend using the backup and sync service which saves, backs up and syncs personal data, photos and online passwords. People worried about security concerns may want to avoid it, but we trust it and use it on our systems. Choose to register the computer if desired. We recommend it. Apple demonstrates natural scrolling. Learn how to scroll using what some call a “backwards” method of scrolling. It takes some getting used to, but does make sense on Trackpads. It behaves like an iPad or iPhone when swiping up or down on a webpage. Change the way scrolling works in OS X using System Preferences and the Mouse or Trackpad applet. Customization of OS X Features Now play around with the computer to get used to the way things work. After doing so, we recommend making a few settings changes to get things looking and working the way a user will want them. To do this launch System Preferences. Users can get to System Preferences using the Apple menu in the top left. Click on the Apple logo. Choose System Preferences from the drop down menu. Also, there’s a Dock icon that opens System Preferences. The Dock sits at the bottom of the screen by default and includes icons to run programs or access files in a folder. With System Preferences open, click the various apps and look around at the customizations possible from this window (see below). Inside each app there’s a help button, usually in the lower right corner, that looks like a questions mark. Click it to learn what all the features do in each preferences app. Here’s one example below that changes the way the Dock works. Make sure to place this window so that the Dock is visible below the window. Change the size slider to the preferred size. Choose whether to use Magnification, which makes the Dock icons look bigger when the user mouses over them. If a user like this, then check the box. Change how big the icons get with the slider. Test it to judge if its set to your liking. Notice how the Dock icons grow larger as the user places mouse cursor over them. Look at the other customizations and settings in System Preferences by clicking Show All at the top of the window and then click other icons. We like to add keyboard shortcuts in the Keyboard app and to change the way the mouse and/or trackpad works in those apps. Learn more about OS X System Preferences from the Apple website. Set Up a Printer Apple offers a simple How To for setting up a printer. For most users, connecting the printer’s USB cable will start the process. Open System Preferences and choose Printers & Scanners. Click on the plus icon in the lower left corner of the list on the left. Follow Apple’s instructions depending on the kind of printer. Many printers require installing the printer driver software first. If that’s the case, find the software on the printer’s web site. Most manufactures offer a Support page with a download link. Find the printer model name and number and search for that printer’s Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks software. Download it to the Downloads folder and run it using the manufacturer’s instructions or follow Apple’s instructions. Set Up iCloud iCloud will save a user’s personal data in the cloud to back up or sync the data with another Mac or iOS device. It works with… Mail Contacts Calendars Reminders Notes Safari (bookmarks, reading lists, shared pages and website login data) Keychain Photos (syncs iOS device images and other Mac images into iPhoto or Aperture) Documents & Data (saves documents created in supported apps like Pages, Keynote or Numbers) Back to My Mac (lets users control their Mac from another system over the Internet) Find My Mac (helps an owner find a lost or stolen Mac) Open the iCloud app from System Preferences. Add the Apple ID for the chosen iCloud account and the password or click Create new Apple ID to get a new one. Now click Sign In. The next screen offers two options. The first turns on iCloud for personal information like Mail, Contacts, Calendars, Reminders, Notes and Safari data. The second one turns on Find My Mac. We recommend using both, unless this makes someone nervous since they prefer not to send personal data to Apple. Click Next. The user will need to enter the User ID and Password again. Click Allow to let Find My Mac find the computer using network information. The next screen forces the user to authenticate their identity with an iOS device or another Mac using Request Approval. The user will see the screen blow on their iPad or iPhone. Otherwise have Apple send the user a code via another device. Once the iCloud Keychain finishes setting itself up, the user can change settings in iCloud. For example, I use Google Calendar instead of iCloud, so I turn that off. Also go into the Options next to the items for Photos and Documents & Data to change those settings. I keep them all checked, which is the default. Set Up the Mac App Store Open the Mac App Store, which sits in the Dock or in the Applications folder, also on the Dock. Another way to find the App Store is to use the Apple Menu in the upper left. The Mac App Store has applications and software that developers submit to Apple and Apple approves for sale and download in the store. Sign into the App Store using the Apple account that holds all of your apps and media. Many user use one account to share with a family, so keep it separate from the Apple ID used for iCloud in the previous step, if that’s the case. Apple updates OS X via the Mac App Store.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Samsung Galaxy S8 vs Galaxy S8+ vs Apple iPhone 7 vs iPhone 7 Plus: Detailed Specifications, Design & Camera Comparison By Ramish Zafar Mar 29, 2017 17Shares Share Tweet Submit After months of continuous leaks and rumors, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are finally here. The devices are all that we’ve been covering for the past four months or so. Samsung’s got a lot riding on the pair as well. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are the company’s first true flagship launches since their predecessors. Its lack of planning with the Note 7 saw the device off with an early exit. Now that the Korean tech giant’s flagships for 2017 are with us, it’s time for a comparison with their 2016 Western competitors, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Take a look below for more details. Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ VS iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus – design, specs & multimedia Design To start off, Apple changed quite a lot of features incrementally on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The devices are the first iPhones in history to feature completely black models. They also feature aluminum 7000 with water resistance at one meter for up to 30 minutes. Dimension wise, the pair is similar to its predecessors. The iPhone 7 measures 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm and weighs in at 138g. The iPhone 7 Plus measures 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm and weighs in at 188g. Apple’s two big design features for the gadgets are the removal of their home button and the 3.5mm earphone jack. Apple also introduced stereo speakers with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Finally, Apple’s Jet Black color for the pair is achieved through some pretty impressive anodization and buffing processes. Related Galaxy S8 Has a Facial Recognition Feature That Suffers From a Huge Security Flaw Moving on to Samsung, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ measure 148.9 x 68.1 x 8.0 mm and 159.5 x 73.4 x 8.1 mm respectively. They also weigh in at 152g and 173g. Comparing this with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the GS8 and GS8+ aren’t light devices. They’re also thicker than Apple’s flagships. Samsung has also taken a unique color approach with its latest flagships. The company will provide the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ in 3 color options in the US, initially. These are Midnight Black, Orchid Gray and Arctic Silver. The pair won’t feature a home button either and Samsung’s also added a special Bixby button on the left. The devices also feature curved corners, which blend in beautifully with the edged screen and no bezels. Display When we talk displays, Samsung is the king. The company’s massive resources allow it to churn out the most advanced smartphone displays in the industry. Samsung is the current leader in terms of display quality and the Korean tech giant shows this off with the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. The smartphones feature an all new 18.5:9 display aspect ratio. This lends them a much taller look. The Galaxy S8 measures 5.8 inches with resolution 1,440 x 2,960. The GS8+ measures 6.2 inches diagonally with resolution 1,440 x 2,960. For the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, Apple’s stuck with LCD displays. The iPhone 7 features a 4.7 inch backlit LCD IPS display with a 65.6% screen to body ratio. Resolution for the smartphone is 1334 x 750 pixels with a pixel density of 326ppi. The iPhone 7 Plus features a 5.5 inch display with resolution 1920 x 1080 pixels and 401ppi density. But while the displays might be LCD, they feature the DCI-P3 color gamut which adds an entire spectrum of colors to be reproduced. Finally, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus also feature 3D Touch, which allows users to interact with their smartphones using varying pressure inputs. Specifications Finally, it’s time to move on to hardware specifications. The Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ feature Qualcomm’s 10nm Snapdragon 835 processor. The 835 features an octa-core design, based on Qualcomm’s Kryo 280 cores. You can read in detail about the processor here. International versions of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will feature 4GB of RAM. Battery capacity for the pair stands at 3,000mAh for the GS8 and 3500mAh for the GS8+, just like the rumor mill predicted. The pair will also support 1 gigabit LTE download speeds. Related Samsung Galaxy S8 vs iPhone 7 vs LG G6 vs LG V20 vs Galaxy S7 Benchmarks Show Modest Gains for Exynos 8895 The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus feature Apple’s A10 Fusion processor with 2GB of RAM. The A10 Fusion is Cupertino’s first quad-core processor and delivers up to 2.34GHz with its Twister cores. RAM count stands at 2GB and 3GB for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus respectively. The pair also promises up to 14h talk time for the iPhone 7 and 21h talk time for the iPhone 7 Plus, on 3G. That’s impressive, considering that the smaller iPhone is powered by a 1960mAh battery, while the larger carries a 2900mAh battery back. Advertisement Camera(s) The iPhone 7 Plus became the first iPhone in Apple history to add a dual camera for the lineup. Both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus’ rear cameras have 12MP resolutions. Talking about the basic camera sensors for both the smartphones, they feature an aperture width of f/1.8. Lens dimensions are 28mm. The iPhone 7 Plus’ second camera is a telephoto sensor with aperture size f/2.8 and width 56mm. Apple introduced its custom ISP with the pair as well, which is a big strength for the devices. It carries out complex computations within seconds and enhances quality by a lot. Finally, both the devices can record video at 2160p@30fps, 1080p@30/60/120fps, 720p@240fps. Front cameras for the pair stand at 7 MP with f/2.2 aperture. They can record video at 1080p@30fps and 720p@240fps. Now, Samsung hasn’t stuck with its traditional approach for the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+’s rear camera sensors. The devices use their predecessors’ equipment, with resolution still standing at 12MP. Aperture size stands at f/1.7, which is slightly smaller than the iPhone’s. The Galaxy S8’s rear camera also feature Samsung’s proprietary Duo Pixel technology. With Duo Pixel, the pair has a phase detection autodiode for every pixel on the camera’s sensor. Apart from that, Samsung hasn’t made any other major upgrades to the pair’s rear camera sensor. The front camera for the pair receives a nice upgrade, though. Resolution for it stands at 8MP, which is a gain over the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, as well. It also features face detection autofocus and wide angle shot capabilities. Conclusion To conclude, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are just what the rumor mill told us. Great incremental upgrades with a couple of new, flashy features to make the public forget about their predecessors. They don’t bring anything new to the table except an increased aspect ratio – something that’s relatively easy for Samsung to pull off given its extensive production resources. 4K rear video recording isn’t anything new, either. The only major addition is Iris scanning, so we’re eager to see how that pans out for Samsung. We love their design and it shows just how far Samsung’s design department has come. Nobody can now accuse the company of copying the iPhone lineup. Samsung’s got its unique look for the smartphones, which is very fluid and easy to approach. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus win in the photography department. Apple loves its cameras and the dedicated ISP with a wide angle rear camera sensor leave room for little upgrades. Design wise, Cupertino’s high quality, nine stage aluminum finish on the jet black iPhone 7 blows Samsung’s curved corners out of the park. And not to mention, Apple did bring curved edges on devices first. The A10 Fusion is beaten by the 10nm Snapdragon 835, but that isn’t a concern at this point. In the end, it boils down to personal preference and whether you prefer Android or iOS. Price wise, both the devices are pretty much at the same level, but the GS8 and GS8+ will cost more internationally. Thoughts? Let us know what you think in the comments section below and stay tuned.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Mobile & Tabs Apple’s next-generation iPhones to include iPad-like True Tone displays Apple’s next-generation iPhones to include iPad-like True Tone displays Apple's next-gen iPhones will feature True Tone displays, according to a new research note from Barclays. By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: April 2, 2017 4:24 pm Apple’s True Tone technology is currently available on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Apple is expected to announce three new iPhones this year, the successors to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, alongside with the iPhone 8. Now, a Barclays research provided to Apple Insider suggests that all three iPhones will feature Apple’s True Tone technology. Apple’s True Tone technology is currently available on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, but it looks like, if the research note is accurate, the company is working to incorporate the feature to new iPhones. Essentially, the three upcoming phones will have using four-channel ambient light sensors that changes the colour of the screen depending on the colour and brightness if the light surrounding the area. Apparently, the sensors will be embedded into the LCD display and sourced from Austrian company AMS. Also read: Five reasons why you shouldn’t upgrade to Samsung Galaxy S8 Barclays analysts Andrew Gardiner, Hiral Patel, Joseph Worf, Blayne Curtis, and Mark Moskowitz write: “For the expected iPhone 7S models, as well as the iPhone 8, we think ams’s content increases due to the inclusion of its full spectral sensing ambient light sensor, as already seen in the iPad Pro for that device’s True Color screen functionality. We estimate this to be a material step-up in content from the $0.60 range to $1.00”. This is not the first time we’re hearing rumours of the True Tone technology to be incorporated on the iPhone. Last year, a few reports incorrectly predicted that iPhone 7 would feature a True Tone display, citing a prediction by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Apple has been working on something big for 2017, which also happens to be the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone. And based on the rumours we’ve been hearing for the last few months, the iPhone 8 will reportedly feature a completely new design with an all-glass enclosure, an OLED display, new augmented reality capabilities and wireless charging. Apparently, a high-end iPhone might cost as much as $1000. Apple could even roll out the successors to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.

Rohit KVN   April 2, 2017 16:07 IST [Representational Image] Samsung Galaxy X release details surface online; flagship foldable phone to debut before Galaxy Note 8. In Picture: Samsung Galaxy S8 series Infinity DisplaySamsung Newsroom Last month, Samsung got trademark certificate for the name - Galaxy X, confirming the existence of the long-rumoured foldable flagship phone. Now, it has come to light that Samsung is planning to launch Galaxy X much earlier than expected. A twitter leakster @mmddj_china of the popular Samsung community blog Samsung Galaxy Club in China has tweeted that Galaxy X will hit stores in the third quarter of 2017, not in first quarter of 2018, as previously reported. Also read: Samsung Galaxy X gets trademark certification; here's what you need to know about Apple iPhone X's rival If it turns true, Samsung's Galaxy X will be used against the Apple's much anticipated iPhone X (aka iPhone 8), which is said to come with state-of-the-art features, including advanced touch sensor and 3D camera on the front, among others. The highlight of Samsung's Galaxy X is its design language. It is said to boast a fully foldable body, thanks to Samsung's proprietary hinge support. As per a leaked image of the company's patent file, the device is shown to have a dynamic fulcrum hinge in the middle, similar to Microsoft Surface Book series. And Samsung GALAXY X in Q3. :)— 萌萌的电教 (@mmddj_china) March 29, 2017 Samsung Galaxy X release details revealed 萌萌的电教 (@mmddj_china) via Twitter Another key aspect of the Galaxy X is that it is expected to come with three types of biometric sensors capable of recognising the eyes' Iris pattern, fingerprint and also palm print, as well. Other internal hardware such as display size, resolution, camera, RAM, storage and battery capacity are yet to be ascertained. But, these features don't matter much, as these can be adjusted to match rival brands. These days, all phones come with same internal hardware, but lack innovative and useful features. We believe 2017 is the year, where smartphone users can expect value-added features in flagship smartphones, as mobile makers especially table toppers Samsung and Apple seek to differentiate from emerging Chinese players like Huawei, Vivo, Xiaomi, Oppo, and others, which offer similar hardware in their phones, but at a lesser price tag. We have already seen many phone-makers including Samsung announcing their own digital assistant (Bixby) with the Galaxy S8 series. Now, the Galaxy X will make use of its unique design language to compete against rivals. In related development, @mmddj_china also claimed that Samsung is indeed working on the Galaxy Note 8, successor of the ill-fated Galaxy Note7. But, it will be released in the fourth quarter of 2017. Samsung GALAXY Note 8 in Q4.:)— 萌萌的电教 (@mmddj_china) March 29, 2017 Samsung Galaxy Note8 release details revealed 萌萌的电教 (@mmddj_china) Samsung, in a bid, to get a head start over Apple iPhone 7, pre-poned the Galaxy Note7 by one month. This decision apparently left very little time for R&D engineers to conduct proper tests and over-looked flawed battery placement. This eventually caused the device in multiple markets to catch fire and got totally banned (sale and production). But, this year it looks like Samsung will use the extra time to conduct more tests to make sure it is safe to use and avoid repeating the last year's mistake. As of now, there is no word on what key features the Galaxy Note8 will come with, other than improved S-Pen stylus and increased RAM, storage and battery capacity, compared to the Galaxy Note7.

Jesse Marlow Share on twitter by James Eyers Apple Pay's ability to toggle through different payment cards was seen as pro-competitive by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and became one of the key factors leading the regulator to favour Apple over the banks. In an interview with The Australian Financial Review after the ACCC knocked back an application by the banks to collectively negotiate with Apple over access to the iPhone's "near field communication" (NFC) controller, ACCC chairman Rod Sims said the banks' arguments that such access could increase competition for digital wallets were "strong" – but the regulator always has to be cautious about intervening in markets. At a time when the industry is looking for ways to encourage switching between banks to improve competition, Mr Sims said he was concerned the banks would attempt to create "such an attractive digital wallet that they would lock people into their services". It is likely proprietary bank digital wallets will only allow payments to be made with that bank's own cards. In contrast, Apple Pay lets its flick between whatever payment cards have been loaded onto the wallet. "Apple Pay is multi-card and it could reduce the lock-in effect that is a barrier to switching between banks," Mr Sims said. "The whole switching argument is very big in terms of why there isn't more competition in banking". Related Quotes 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating... Last updated: Updating...

Mr Sims, who is speaking this week at The Australian Financial Review Banking & Wealth Summit, also said the ACCC was also concerned that if Apple was to open its NFC to the banks it would be forced towards the operating model for Google's Android phones. "Who are we to say that we should force Apple to compete in the same way Google has decided to present its offering?" he said. The ACCC was also not comfortable assuming mobile phones would become the dominant way of making payments in the future. With the retail sector backing the banks' application given its own interest in developing digital wallets, Mr Sims said offers to shoppers could be made in ways other than using NFC at the time of payment, such as GPS tracking. "We've decided not to intervene here. Let's see how it plays out. We will be as fascinated as everyone else to see how that happens." magazine.afr.com BEN WBC NAB CBA Share Share via Email Share on Google Plus Post on facebook wall Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit Advertisement Advertisement Related articles New hope for active investing 1 hr ago Ex-Xero boss to lead financial adviser platform ASIC eyes interest-only lending Contains: Infographics APRA can't stop landlord nation Contains: Infographics Bank chiefs back loan curbs to help keep brakes on RBA Contains: Infographics Latest Stories Let's be honest about start-up failure 4 mins ago Keep faith says new Healthscope CEO 6 mins ago 1-Page shows ASX investors start-up dysfunction 8 mins ago More Lang Walker gambles on $100m Fijian paradise How Jose Neves built a fashion unicorn Fashion that fuses East and West 43 little accessories to stash away Why chefs need a fashion makeover Nominate a True Leader for the 2017 BOSS list Forget the robots, hire old people 3 signs that your leadership is failing Why startups don't need corporate advisers How to foster team chemistry You're not special but so what?

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Apple iPhone X news: Anniversary mobile tipped to come with iPad Pro screen feature; spike in manufacturing cost expected With True Tone display in place, Apple iPhone 8 ( & also iPhone 7s series) owners will have less eye strain while reading on the device, even it is in low-light condition. Rohit KVN   April 2, 2017 14:49 IST An Apple iPhone 7REUTERS/Regis Duvignau Now, that Samsung's new Galaxy S8 is launched, the media attention has turned its focus on Apple's anniversary mobile –iPhone X aka iPhone 8. As per latest report, the upcoming device is expected to feature iPad Pro-like display. Apple is reportedly incorporating iPad Pro-like True Tone display in to iPhone X and also the generic iPhone 7s and the iPhone 7s Plus models, Investment bank Barclays analyst, citing reliable company insider, told his client investor. Also read: Apple iPhone turns 10: Better bring anniversary mobile (aka iPhone 8) with game changing innovation or else face Dodo's fate! The Barclays research analyst note, now available with Mac Rumors goes on to say that the iPhones' display will have a full spectral sensing ambient light sensor to change the colour of the screen, just allowing the right percentage and intensity of white light the user need while reading. This will drastically reduce the strain on the eyes and particularly the improve viewing experience for the user, who whilst reading on the iPhone, moves around the house or any other place with a different lighting set. This is really a valuable addition to the iPhone X and the iPhone 7s series. But, it comes at a cost though. Due to the additional integrated sensors, True Tone Display might make new iPhones a bit costly. It is said to be procured from the same Austrian semiconductor manufacturer AMS, who supplied displays for the iPad Pro, and would cost $1 for each iPhone unit. [Note: normal display panel, used in previous iteration, is used to cost around $0.60 a piece] Apple iPhone X: What we know so far As per the latest reports, Apple's anniversary mobile, the iPhone X, is said to have OLED-based display with state-of-the-art wrap-around technology, wherein key components such as earpiece, FaceTime camera and Touch ID fingerprint sensor will be integrated right into the display panel, thus increasing the screen-to-body ratio and offer a true edge-to-edge display for immersive viewing, experience without increasing dimensions of the device. Apple is also expected to incorporate facial and gesture recognisable laser sensor with front-camera to help authenticate the owner's face and also scan the eyes' iris pattern to unlock iPhone screens. Further, the front-camera will be 3D-capable, wherein the iPhone X users will be able to play AR (Augmented Reality) games on their devices with a protagonist featuring 3D image of their own face. Other expected features include a new generation Apple A11 Fusion CPU, higher RAM and battery capacity. As far as the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus are concerned, they are expected to have an identical design language as seen on the current iPhone 7 series, but with incremental upgrades in terms internal hardware, which includes new A11 series Fusion CPU backed by 3GB RAM and bigger battery.

Based on our first impressions of the device, the simple naming makes sense. The 9.7-inch tablet presents an experience that's so typically iPad that there's not much to remark about. This tablet replaced the iPad Air 2 in Apple's tablet lineup, and just by looking at it, it would be easy to get the two confused. The refreshed-for-2017 version maintains the same size display as well the familiar aluminum form factor that all iPads have. The overall body dimensions of this iPad and its Air 2 predecessor are within millimeters of one another, and its dimensions are identical to those of the original iPad Air (2013). The new iPad is essentially a rebooted iPad Air 1 with some internal updates. Sick of Ads? More than 700 New Atlas Plus subscribers read our newsletter and website without ads. Join them for just US$19 a year.More Information Knowing some thickness and weight was added since the Air 2 (presumably to fit a bigger battery and boosted internals while keeping on budget), I wanted to see if a return to the iPad Air 1's heft was problematic. I do think it could stand to be a little lighter, but then again, if it were much lighter, it would be strikingly so. That's not what we're expecting from Apple's least expensive tablet ever (US$329). So far, my most notable takeaway was a disappointment – after becoming accustomed to last year's premium devices, this iPad's display leaves something to be desired. Large photos on social media feeds look a bit grainy, but the color accuracy (or lack thereof) bothered me more than resolution. Colors seem off, and perhaps a little oversaturated. This iPad has boosted internals over those of the aging Air 2, but those minor changes aren't easily perceived. (After all, this tablet uses a last-generation Apple A9 processor – it's nothing we haven't seen before.) The entire experience of setting up, handling, and web and app surfing on this tablet doesn't throw any curveballs. Based on a short session, the iOS 10 experience was nothing to complain about, but nothing to get excited about, either. Of course, a closer look might reveal some more insights on what Apple's entry-level tablet gets right, and what it gets wrong. How does it fare through day-to-day demands and more rigorous use? How much does the unimpressive display detract from the experience? Stay tuned for a full-length review. The 2017 iPad is available now, starting at $329 for a Wi-Fi only/32 GB storage configuration.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Business Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Strong iPhone 7 sales saved Apple’s manufacturer from record decline Chris Mills @chrisfmills March 31st, 2017 at 7:04 PM Share Tweet The fate of Apple and Foxconn, its gargantuan Chinese manufacturing partner, are closely linked. When iPhone and iPad sales flatlined a little around the iPhone 6s era, Foxconn slipped into decline. From Q3 2015 to Q3 2016, Foxconn’s revenue was declining on a year-by-year basis. With little structural change in the business, a decline was expected for the fourth quarter of 2016. But once again, analysts underestimated the iPhone 7. Don't Miss: It turns out the Galaxy S8’s best new security feature isn’t very secure at all Net profit was up 30 percent for Foxconn compared to the same quarter in 2015, a major jump by any measure. The fact that it beat analysts’ predictions of a loss — and beat it by $660 million — shows how far off some predictions were. Net profit was T$68.77 billion ($2.26 billion), up from T$52.93 billion in Q4 2015, according to Reuters. The turnaround was mostly attributed to increased iPhone sales. Apple drives about half of Foxconn’s profits, so it makes sense that Apple’s record shipment of iPhones in Q4 last year would see Foxconn turn around sharply. Other investments, such as Foxconn’s in-house manufacturing robots division and its purchase of screen-maker Sharp, are also starting to pay dividends. With a strong 2016 final quarter on record, Foxconn is now well set up for a record year. Apple is expected to release three new iPhone models this year, including updates to the iPhone 7 generation and an all-new iPhone 8 (also referred to as the iPhone Edition or iPhone X). Those updates promise a growth in the number of iPhone sales overall, and if the iPhone 8 actually sells for more than $1,000 as has been rumored, the profit margin on every iPhone could also go up. Add in a revamped iPad line with a new budget model, and things are looking rosy for Foxconn.

According to a Japanese newspaper on Saturday, US tech firms Apple, Google and Amazon threw their hats into the Toshiba bid. Currently, there are 10 bidders including the world’s third largest NAND flash maker Western Digital, Korean chipmaker SK hynix, Taiwanese tech firm Hon Hai and US chipmaker Broadcom. Toshiba decided to sell its lucrative chip unit last month to make up for the loss of its US nuclear unit Westinghouse, which filed for bankruptcy protection. Apple’s interest in bidding has gained attention as it is a key client of Toshiba and Samsung’s mobile NAND flash. If the world’s largest smartphone maker is capable of supplying NAND for its smartphones, Samsung will lose its main client. As to the internet firms, Google and Amazon, they may want to buy NAND makers as they can make their own data servers without relying on chipmakers in the upcoming cloud and artificial intelligence era, experts said.  “The US tech firms -- Apple, Google and Amazon -- have become the next attractive bidders following Western Digital as Toshiba can have stable supply chains (for smartphones or data servers) from them,” an industry source told The Korea Herald. Western Digital is currently the most attractive bidder as the US chip giant and Toshiba have long maintained a close relationship by jointly running Toshiba’s key NAND flash production base in Yokaichi. “Then comes SK hynix, which can create synergy with Toshiba as the same chipmakers. Hon Hai is the least attractive bidder as Toshiba and the Japanese government do not want to sell the firm to Chinese companies because of the technology leak concerns,” the source added. Asahi Shimbun and Yomiuri Shimbun said when Chinese and Taiwan companies acquire Toshiba, that could lead to Toshiba’s memory chip technology being used in military technology. If SK acquires Toshiba, it will become the world’s largest NAND flash maker. Currently, Samsung is the largest provider with a 37 percent share, followed by Toshiba with 18 percent, Western Digital with 17 percent, Micron Technology with 10 percent and SK hynix with 9.6 percent. However, even if SK hynix buys the chip unit, it may suffer from the winner’s curse, Daishin Securities said. SK hynix reportedly has 4 trillion won ($3.5 billion) in cash asset, much lower than the 20 trillion won of the estimated bidding price. If the firm excessively borrows money for the acquisition, it may face a financial struggle when the boom of the chip business slows down.  By Shin Ji-hye (shinjh@heraldcorp.com) 영어뉴스를 통한 ListeningㆍReading 실력 향상 단기 학습 프로그램 [NEST] 1.

Maybe you downloaded and still play the original Flappy Bird. Those old apps still work, but not for long. There are over 2 million apps in iTunes but hundreds of thousands of these apps haven't been updated in years. The developers abandoned them. Late last year Apple sent them an ultimatum: Update or get ousted from the App store. With the 10.3 iOS update, time's up. iPhone users just got a notification that it's time to update your iPhone. iOS 10.3 includes a new filing system which means when it is installed, apps that were built on the old system will stop working. After I updated Monday night I noticed a few old apps crashed when I tried to open them. Others gave me a warning that the app needs updating and to contact the developer. If an app hasn't been updated in years it has already been removed from the App Store. Even if you paid for them they no longer work. You shouldn't blame Apple though, the developer simply left the app dying on the Apple vine. A majority of dead or abandoned apps are free games and trying to convince or even reach the developer is next to impossible. Since the apps aren't profitable for the company they have no interest in spending money to update it. Apple has added a section to the settings menu to quickly identify apps that are causing a problem with the new update. In settings go to general and about. You'll find a new tab here called "App Compatability." It shows a list of any problem-producing apps installed on the phone. A click will take you to the apps listing in the App Store where you can find information on possibly contacting the developer. Don't get your hopes up for an answer. Those developers abandoned the apps 5-6 years ago. Abandoned apps that Apple has already identified are no longer listed in iTunes and even if some continue to work with iOS update 10.3 it is likely they won't work as Apple begins rolling out post-update updates. × Post a comment as Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

It can help alleviate a host of skin and hair problems, from soothing acne, to cleaning make-up brushes. As compiled from Elle magazine, here are seven great uses of Apple Cider Vinegar that you might not have heard about before. 1. Foot spa Know someone with a smelly-foot problem? Suggest a night in with an apple cider vinegar foot soak to them. The acid in the liquid makes it quite good at neutralising bad odours and also helps in dealing with warts and fungus too. You can make your own vinegar soak by mixing 1/4 cup of the stuff in a small tub of warm water. 5 weird beauty hacks you need to try right now 2. Acne aid This is super tough to deal with, especially as a teenager. But we bet you didn’t know that apple cider vinegar could help with your acne? It has been known to kill bacteria and balance out the skin’s pH levels, while also absorbing some of the excess oils from its surface. Mix one part vinegar to three to four parts water, apply the solution directly to skin with a cotton wool pad and leave it on for ten minutes before rinsing. Try doing this three times a day if you can. 3. Hair affair Some hair treatments use scary ingredients like formaldehyde and are expensive. Not to mention, most of them will add yet another layer of product onto your already product-heavy hair. If you’re looking for a cost-effective way of stripping them back out of heavy locks, look no further. The acetic acid in apple cider vinegar will balance your hair’s pH levels, stimulate your scalp and strip off some of the product build-up and residue. Dilute some with four cups of water and massage into your hair post-shampoo.

Stories about Rita Hepper, Crystal Hanseth, Glenn Vest and Kevin Worden will be printed in the Sunday, April 9 edition of the H&N.  Humility is a quality that runs strong in the eight Crystal Apple Awardees of 2017. When asked about receiving the recognition, all either said they preferred to work in the background, or could think of other educators more deserving. “There are tons of people who are more deserving than I am,” said special education teacher Stephanie Harris. “We all love working with kids.” × Advertisement “I was shocked. It’s such an honor,” said Brittany Carr, kindergarten teacher at Stearns Elementary. “I work with such amazing teachers, not only in the building, but I collaborate with so many phenomenal kindergarten teachers in our district.” “Knowing there’s so many people out there that are working with kids and could be receiving this honor, and here I was selected,” said Glenn Vest, special education paraprofessional at Brixner Junior High. “I’m just really humbled.” “I’d rather stay in the background,” said Kevin Worden, attendance secretary at Henley High School. The Klamath County School District is honoring its best this April with the fifth annual Crystal Apple Awards. The eight awardees for 2017 are: Jody Beake – advanced math teacher – Lost River Jr./Sr. High School Brittany Carr – kindergarten teacher – Stearns Elementary School Stephanie Harris – special education teacher – Mazama High School Ashley West – first grade teacher – Henley Elementary School Rita Hepper – instructional coach – Chiloquin Elementary School Crystal Hanseth – print shop – KCSD District Office Glenn Vest – special education paraprofessional – Brixner Junior High School Kevin Worden – attendance secretary – Henley High School The Klamath County School District is proud to showcase the amazing work these teachers, staff and all-around educators do for children in this community. “The Crystal Apple Awards celebrate educators who inspire and encourage students in the classroom and in the community, every day,” said David Wehr, Shasta Elementary principal and Crystal Apple organizer. “We know you change kids’ lives. This celebrates the few who represent the many.” The Crystal Apple Awards Gala will begin at 7 p.m. on April 18 at the Ross Ragland Theater. Staff and families are welcome to come celebrate the good work of the entire district. The Klamath County School District Honor Choir will be performing at this event as well. Below are profiles of four of the eight 2017 Klamath County School District Crystal Apple awardees. Jody Beake Jody Beake has been teaching math for more than three decades. In all, she has 34 years’ teaching experience, and 28 of them have been at Lost River Jr./Sr. High School. “I have taught doctors and lawyers. I have taught firemen. I have taught five teachers in this district. I have taught my principal, who is my boss. I have taught the mechanic that fixed my car,” Beake said. “It’s nice to know if you stay in a community long enough, you get to find out what they do after they leave.” Her impact is felt throughout the Merrill and Malin community, including by her principal and former student, Jamie Ongman. “Jody builds a learning environment that promotes a willingness to take intellectual risks and the ability for all students to succeed,” Ongman said. “She fills her lessons with fun activities and stories to keep students interested and engaged.” Beake teaches all the higher level math classes students in grades 10 to 12. She is part of the math PLC group, has previously been on the Lost River site council and senior project committee. She is also an active member in her church, Hope Lutheran. Brittany Carr Brittany Carr wakes up every morning excited to get to school and see her kindergarten students grow. “I’m so excited to be a part of their lives and part of their journey,” she said. “I hope the work I’m able to do with them makes an impact for them. They certainly make an impact on my life.” Carr is in her seventh year of teaching kindergarten at Stearns Elementary. The whole school sees the impact of the work she does in and out of the classroom. In addition to wrangling a classroom of 5-year-olds, Carr is a member of the Collaboration Grant Committee, the P-3 Committee, the Stearns Leadership Team and she is the FIT Team Leader for Stearns. She helped organize the 2016 Holiday Craft Bazaar and helped Migrant Summer School Principal Ruben Paschal in developing pre-kindergarten classes for that program. She previously participated in the Stearns Booster Club and the KCSD Kindergarten Math Team. Outside of the school she is a “key spouse” volunteer with Kingsley Field for deployed service members and their families. “Brittany Carr is the type of kindergarten teacher that you want every child to have,” said Stearns Principal Beth Clark. “Mrs. Carr has high learning expectations for every student in her classroom. She is a kind, caring and highly skilled teacher.” Stephanie Harris When Stephanie Harris sees her students walk across the stage at graduation, it’s the best feeling in the world. “It’s what I live for,” she said. “What I work for. That’s what it’s all about.” Harris has worked in the district for 11 years: first at Fairhaven Elementary, then Merrill and Malin elementaries. Six years ago she switched to teaching older students at Mazama High School. Harris teaches special education classes as a Learning Specialist and co-teaches English with Jennifer DeForrest. “She is dedicated to her students: not just in the classroom, but also in their everyday lives,” Mazama Principal Steve Morosin said. “She is a staunch advocate for their rights, helping other staff members to accommodate their individual needs.” In addition to teaching, Harris facilitates Individual Learning Plans, 504 plans (for student medical needs), FAIR plans and helps develop curriculum. She is part of the English Professional Learning Community (PLC), Co-Teaching PLC, and Special Services PLC. She is an adviser on the Mazama Kindness Club and volunteers with the Mazama Sparrow Club. And she volunteers at school events. Ashley West Ashley West enjoys spending each working day surrounded by first-graders. “I feel lucky to work with these smart, funny students every day,” she said. “I love to see their faces light up when they understand something and to be able to help them grow as learners.” West is in her 11th year of teaching first grade at Henley Elementary School. School activities and professional development are important to West. At Henley Elementary she is an English language arts Core Reading expert, on the school’s Response to Intervention team, on the Collaboration Grant team, a Safe and Civil team member and on the emergency committee. She is also a Career Pathways Chair Leader and on the First Grade PLC. And she is on the Henley Booster Club and participates in student mentoring. “Ashley West shares her enthusiasm for learning with her students and co-workers,” said Henley Elementary Principal Janell Preston. “She inspires everyone to do their very best.” Tags Stephanie Harris School Education Teacher Brittany Carr Kindergarten Jody Beake Ashley West Student Trending Fatal crash south of Klamath Falls claims 1, injures 6 Chiloquin man accused of raping a minor Chiloquin teen raises ALS bar for family friend Innovation, excellence & investment Who will wear the crown?

Nomad Soul / Igor Lateci / Shutterstock / Katie Martin / The Atlantic Most Popular It's Not Over Yet for Donald Trump David Frum Apr 1, 2017 The Management Myth Matthew Stewart Jun 1, 2006 A Satisfying Finale for Big Little Lies Christopher Orr Apr 2, 2017 What Is an Elite College Really Worth? Derek Thompson Apr 1, 2017 Putin Likes to Pretend 1917 Never Happened Mikhail Zygar Apr 1, 2017 Megan Garber Mar 23, 2017 Culture Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size A recent ad for the InterContinental hotel brand, a lush video set in London, features an interview with Kathryn Sargent, the first woman master tailor to open her own shop on Savile Row. “The whole experience of making a beautiful garment for someone,” Sargent tells the camera, as she expertly marks a piece of wool, “empathy is at the heart of that.” The video is titled, for YouTube purposes, “Stories of the InterContinental® Life Presents: Empathy—A Bespoke Connection”; it is accompanied by the “Rewards of Empathy” episode of InterContinental’s podcast, which features another discussion with Sargent and culminates in, as the episode’s notes put it, “a chat with a pair of philosophy experts about the rewards of empathy in our daily lives.” Related Stories Why Funny TV Commercials Work Why Good Advertising Works (Even When You Think It Doesn't) The Reality of Those 'Real People, Not Actors' Ads Hotelier, atelier, the Rewards of Empathy—you could, certainly, question whether an observation about suits makes full sense as an observation about society. But that, of course, would miss the point. “Empathy” has been ported over from psychology and moral philosophy to become an ethic of the moment not because of its literal meaning (strictly, the experience of—and the ability to experience—the feelings of others), but because of its broader connotations, in a time so anxious about civility, and inequality, and inclusivity, and ethno-nationalism: To invoke “empathy” is to insist that the stuff of human connection will triumph over the stuff of everything else. Which is probably why it is being used, so commonly, to sell stuff—and why InterContinental has a good deal of company in its attempt to reap the Rewards of Empathy. Apple concluded a recent ad with a call to “open your heart to everyone.” Starbucks capped its “Year of Good” TV spot—a commercial that quantifies all the social good the company did over the year 2016, from the hiring of 8,000 veterans to the funding of more than 300,000 ethically sourced farms—with an entreaty to “Be Good to Each Other.” Amazon touted the human-connective capabilities of its vast warehouse (and the religious pragmatism of kneepads) by featuring a priest and an imam playing out a wordless, piano-tracked version of a modern-day O. Henry story. Hyatt featured scenes of people initially divided, suspicious of each other, until, as the tempo of “What the World Needs Now Is Love” crescendos, they come together, joyously, as the tagline “For a World of Understanding” pops up onscreen. It’s a sentiment shared by another recent ad, one whose voiceover insists to its viewers, “We can be one. And all it takes is the willingness to dare.” It was an ad for Cadillac. * * * Heady promises, warm feelings, better things for better living—it’s on the one hand the extremely typical stuff of ads, so longstanding an element of commercial messaging that we can safely assume that Neanderthals, once they realized they could rent out space in their caves, spread the news about Lairbnb via grunted renditions of “We Are the World.” But when InterContinental summons the InterPersonal to sell its hotel rooms (or when Cadillac summons the same to sell cars; or when Expedia airs ads celebrating the aiding of refugees; or when Honey Maid, maker of graham crackers, airs spots promoting cross-cultural understanding; or when Panera, the fast-casual purveyor of Bacon Turkey Bravo® Sandwiches, adopts as its tagline, “Food as It Should Be”), what is being invoked is not merely blithe aspiration, cultural ideals fit to be transformed into corporate profits. The ads are, instead, profoundly political. And they are explicitly moral. They are making claims not just about what we should buy, but about what we should be. This is a moment of pervasive political awareness in American life: Politics are infusing pop culture, high culture, and commercial culture. And so, this moment of anxiety and creativity and cultural fracturing and political engagement and political apathy has brought a slight plot twist to the long and winding story of American advertising: It has gone and grown a conscience. The commercials that are ascendant at the moment are selling not just what ads so long have—power, prestige, beauty, glamour, sex—but also, more broadly, a vision of how those things can serve society. They are substituting claims about what is desirable for claims about what is right. They using their particular bully pulpit to moralize and sermonize and offer up, in the end, that most American of reassurances: that a better world can be achieved, because a better world can be bought. * * * The global ad firm J. Walter Thompson recently conducted research into Americans’ attitudes toward commercial brands that take stances on political issues. In a cross-generational group of respondents, 88 percent agreed with the firm’s proposition that corporations have the power to influence social change; 78 percent of them agreed that companies “should take action to address the important issues facing society.” And Millennials were particularly pro-action. As Lucie Greene, the worldwide director of the Innovation Group at JWT, summed things up to me: “In these times, actually, it’s becoming more important for brands to take a point of view.” Not just because brands have the power to effect change, but because people want them—expect them—to use it. It’s an insight on display in ads that conclude with entreaties to “open your heart to everyone”; it’s also on display in the spate of recent commercials that have functioned as overt (if also sometimes covert) political advocacy. During the 2017 Super Bowl, Airbnb aired a spot—and an accompanying hashtag—featuring a series of different faces flashing onscreen as a background to text that read: “No matter who you are … no matter where you’re from … who you love … or who you worship … we all belong. The world is more beautiful the more you accept.” That ad aired on TV around the same time as the Budweiser commercial that celebrates immigration. And the 84 Lumber ad that (maybe?) did the same. And the Audible ad that features Zachary Quinto reading a line from Nineteen Eighty-Four: “If he were allowed contact with foreigners … the sealed world in which he lives would be broken.” The spots are subtle in their messaging; they operate with enough ambiguity to allow for a kind of plausible deniability. (“We all belong” is both stridently argumentative and, seen in another way, entirely meaningless.) But the ads are doing what JWT’s research suggested brands should do, to win converts: They’re taking a stand, and an expressly political one. It’s hard not to interpret the Amazon ad featuring the priest and the imam, wordless though it may be, the way The Daily Beast did: as “a total repudiation of Trumpism.” It’s hard not to read something similar into Samsung’s Super Bowl ad for its virtual-reality technology—the one that aired VR footage of Donald Trump’s inauguration followed immediately by footage of the women’s march on Washington. And the Expedia spot that follows a woman around the world, as she aids refugees? The company arranged the ad’s premiere, tellingly, to drop during CNN’s coverage of the new president’s inauguration. When marketers act as arbiters—of goodness, of rightness, of us-ness—does that say something profoundly optimistic, or profoundly cynical? This is a moment of pervasive political awareness in American life: Politics, and more specifically political conversation, are infusing pop culture, and high culture, and commercial culture. During a time that finds late-night variety show hosts doubling as advocacy journalists and sitcoms airing episodes that grapple explicitly with Donald Trump’s presidency, it’s perhaps unsurprising that self-consciously commercial messages would follow suit. JWT’s report hints at a broader truth: To be relevant in America, right now—whether you are an artist or a journalist or a copywriter at Wieden+Kennedy—will often demand explicit engagement with American politics. In that sense, it makes sense that commercial messages are putting the “ad” in “advocacy.” Of course the CEO of a fast-casual bakery chain sees fit to declare, “If you share our values and share that philosophy, then yeah, come on in.” Of course a Starbucks ad, starring a Marine veteran who is now employed as a barista, culminates with the reminder not just to “Be good to each other,” but also to “Be 🇺🇸  to each other.” * * * It is a truth universally acknowledged, and then silkscreened onto a t-shirt you can buy on Amazon: Everything—politics, protest, feminism, the ephemeral warmth of interpersonal connection—will get commercialized, in the end. We buy the products; we are the products; that those two facts are intimately bound up in each other is part of the agreement American culture has made with its unique kind of capitalism. Brands will be #brands, and all that; Starbucks serving extra shots of empathy along with its caramel macchiatos is in one way simply another extension of the #brand-being. It’s notable, though, that morality-via-marketing is trending during a time that has also brought “fake news” and “alternative facts” and general epistemic panic to the minds of many Americans. Public faith in “the media” and its institutions is, at the moment, extremely low, in some part expressly because that media and its institutions have engaged in the kind of subtle sermonizing these ads are now engaging in. And companies, at the same time, are more powerful than ever: Facebook has more users than the most populous country in the world. Its CEO has recently been talking like a presidential contender. “It used to be that brands, by definition, tried to play it safe, or be apolitical,” JWT’s Lucie Greene told me. Now, she said, “we’re looking to brands to be some sort of port in the storm.” We used to look to other things to anchor us as the world churned. And we still, to some extent, do. But what does it say about us—the “us” that the commercials assure us we still can be, together—that brands are now helping to fill that role? What are we to make of ads that engage in the kind of discourse once reserved for pulpits and art and books and op-ed pages? When marketers act as arbiters—of goodness, of rightness, of us-ness—does that suggest something profoundly optimistic, or profoundly cynical, about what it means, at this moment, to be 🇺🇸  to each other? Empathy is with us not just in ads, but also in subtler ways, through snack bars announcing, “nice to meet you, we’re KIND®” Here’s a case for optimism: You could see such commercials as responses to a situation that finds Americans more politically empowered than they have ever been before. Susan Strasser, a historian of American consumer culture, told me that while, on the one hand, today’s expressly political ads have a long precedent in the U.S.—see Kellogg’s co-optation of Roosevelt’s Square Deal in 1913—they are also, at the same time, very much of their time. They take for granted the fact that today’s citizens can make their voices heard not just at the voting booth, and not just at the protest march, but also on social media. People can easily, and instantly, become part of a movement or a boycott. (As Strasser pointed out, “We’re all pretty quick to say, right now, ‘Yes, we’re going to Nordstrom,’ and ‘No, we’re not doing Uber.’”) So while brands can shape public opinion, in the way #brands have always shaped public opinion, they are also shaped by it. Producer and consumer describes an economic reality; it also describes an economic tautology. That mutuality—the expectations people have for companies not just to sell us things, but to sell us ourselves—helps to explain the new trendiness of ethical sourcing, and fair trade, and the rise of the b-corp, and Chipotle’s decision to print literature on its burrito bags. It also helps to explain why empathy itself has become so popular of late, as a commercial ethic as well as a moral one—a fitting corollary to authenticity and inclusivity and other aspirations that are helping to shape the culture of the moment. Empathy is with us not just in ads, but also in subtler ways, through snack bars announcing, “nice to meet you, we’re KIND®”; and social scientists researching whether reading fiction can engender empathy; and socially conscious coders spending time in “empathy bootcamps”; and Mark Zuckerberg vowing to go on an empathy tour of the country—the 2017 version of a “listening tour”—following criticisms of fake news’s complicity in the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Michael Schur, the creator and showrunner of the NBC sitcom The Good Place, told The Times that he wanted the series to explore how to live one’s life in a “self-sacrificing, empathetic way.” An episode of the new podcast Missing Richard Simmons featured a long meditation on the connections between empathy and therapy, attempting to coin the term “empathist” in the process. The American Girl franchise recently released the WellieWishers, a collection of dolls distinguished visually by their wearing of rain boots, but rhetorically by the fact that they are, as the company’s website puts it, “a sweet and silly group of girls who each have the same big, bright wish: to be a good friend.” * * * It’s become something of a cliché to compare this American moment, fraught and fractured as it is, with the 1960s. Some of the chaos of those years, in the United States, arose from television and the particular kind of empathy it enforced: Here, for the first time, were scenes of war, moving and real, brought to people’s living rooms. Here, too, were grave injustices and the protests against them, rendered in sound and image rather than text alone. The right side of history can often double as the more lucrative side of history. And here, at the same time, were companies grappling with how to sell things both through and in spite of TV, during a time that found many Americans deeply yearning to transcend their desire for things themselves. While the counterculture of the American ’60s seemed to be defiant of American commercial culture of that time, the journalist Thomas Frank has argued, the two were in fact deeply intertwined—so deeply, Frank writes in his 1998 book The Conquest of Cool, that the counterculture gave rise to “a new species of hip consumerism, a perpetual motion machine in which disgust with the falseness, shoddiness, and everyday oppressions of consumer society could be enlisted to drive the ever-accelerating wheels of consumption.” It was during this time that Volkswagen, automaker of Nazi Germany, was cannily rebranded with ’60s-friendly insouciance through a series of ad campaigns that emphasized irony, and knowingness, and a wink-nudge approach to car-buying. It was during this time, as well, that Avis ran ad copy reading, “They’ll probably never run this ad.” And that Chivas Regal breezily informed potential customers, as they browsed the pages of Life magazine, “Don’t bother to read this ad.” It was a time in which the real-life Don Drapers of war-weary America—jaded, canny, hungry—realized they could harness the era’s widespread mistrust of consumerism to encourage, yes, rampant consumption. So that’s the more cynical read on the ads of today, messages that smarm and tug on heartstrings and generally put the “sell” in the celebration of human connection. You could read Apple and Amazon and Airbnb and their ilk as being engaged, just as their predecessors were, in a kind of purposeful collusion. You could place them on the through line that gave American TV audiences of the 1960s footage of hand-clasping hippies singing upon a hilltop, their thirsts quenched by Coca-Cola, and, later, that gave viewers of the 1980s spots that invoked Orwellian philosophy to sell personal computers, and, later, that found “Benetton ads” serving as shorthand for a world desperate to see itself reflected in its commercial media. You could group them, too, with the recent Campbell’s ads starring a toddler and two doting fathers (hashtag: #realreallife), and Kohl’s ads using an interracial, same-sex couple as their models, and Mattel ads featuring a boy playing with a Barbie doll, and Oreo, master of social media, making waves (and gaining fans, even those who don’t enjoy chocolate or “creme”) with its “pride cookie.” You could see them all as progressive messages that share a convenient conviction: that the right side of history can often double as the more lucrative side of history. If the broad struggle of the ‘60s was preserving individualism against threats of conformity, today’s may be preserving community against threats of individualism. And you could read the ads as reflections not just of their cultural moment, but also of their technological one. While the counterculture of the ’60s came about in part because of technology—the television, that cool medium that became so very heated—the 2017 version of that era’s love-ins and be-ins has arisen in part, perhaps, because of our own technological revolution: the one that has come by way of the internet and its communications platforms. Blogger and Facebook and Twitter and Tumblr and Snapchat and the like are technologies of, yes, empathy. They have given people unprecedented access to each others’ inner lives. They have meant that a country that was recently bowling alone is now also bowling with everyone, at once. Companies understand that. And they are using that understanding to do what companies always will: to make profits. So, yes. Here is kindness, commodified. Here is that old standby of the classic ad campaign, the clever tagline—“Tastes great, less filling”; “Takes a licking and keeps on ticking”; “Breakfast of champions”; “Don’t bother to read this ad”—replaced with more broad-minded entreaties toward empathy. Here is the logic of “Just Do It,” transformed from a vaguely libertarian message into a vaguely liberal one: “We All Belong.” And here are marketers recognizing that, while a diamond may be forever, even more enduring is the ineffable human connection that has allowed hunks of carbon to be invested with romantic allure in the first place. Love isn’t just “what makes a Subaru, a Subaru.” It’s also a mechanism through which advertising can exert its influence. In 1951, the ever-prescient Marshall McLuhan released The Mechanical Bride, a collection of essays about the increasingly powerful advertising industry, grouping it with the increasingly powerful news media. The subtitle of his book was Folklore of Industrial Man. And it was, of course, a fitting one. Ads are the stories we tell ourselves, about ourselves. They are nakedly self-interested, which is also to say extremely honest. So when InterContinental insists that buying a hotel room doubles as an endorsement of empathy, that is revealing—not just about the brand, but about the rest of us. Just as it’s revealing when so many other commercials make the same rhetorical move. If the broad cultural struggle of the 1960s was the preservation of the individual against the threats of conformity, the struggle of the current moment is, perhaps, the preservation of community against the threats of individualism. Ayn Rand is all around. Selfishness tempts and taunts. Empathy is the easy and obvious solution—the moral rebuke—to that. And Hyatt, after all, is completely correct: What the world needs now, as always, is love, sweet love. The question is what it says about that world, and its current occupants, that a hotel brand is the voice trying to remind us of that.

Twitter Email Most Popular Presented by Adam Hunger / Reuters It's Not Over Yet for Donald Trump David Frum The resources of a determined president are great, and Trump’s enablers are powerful. In the late fall of 1995, the columnist Ben Wattenberg—on tour to promote a new book—received a phone call from an admiring reader. The reader was President Bill Clinton. Over the next hour, Clinton praised Wattenberg’s work as the most accurate criticism of his administration to date. In his syndicated column to be published Thursday, Mr. Wattenberg quotes Mr. Clinton as saying that he was initially too interested in the "legislative scorecard, rather than in philosophy," focusing like a prime minister on shepherding his party's legislation, instead of using the bully pulpit like a chief executive. The column says Mr. Clinton said he was "so anxious to fix the economy" that he "changed philosophically and missed the boat."

If you want to succeed in business, don’t get an M.B.A. Study philosophy instead During the seven years that I worked as a management consultant, I spent a lot of time trying to look older than I was. I became pretty good at furrowing my brow and putting on somber expressions. Those who saw through my disguise assumed I made up for my youth with a fabulous education in management. They were wrong about that. I don’t have an M.B.A. I have a doctoral degree in philosophy—nineteenth-century German philosophy, to be precise. Before I took a job telling managers of large corporations things that they arguably should have known already, my work experience was limited to part-time gigs tutoring surly undergraduates in the ways of Hegel and Nietzsche and to a handful of summer jobs, mostly in the less appetizing ends of the fast-food industry. Continue Reading Maxim Shemetov / Reuters Putin Likes to Pretend 1917 Never Happened Mikhail Zygar How the Russian Revolution became taboo Just over 100 years ago, Russian Emperor Nicholas II abdicated his throne and his vast empire ceased to exist, setting off decades of world-shaking change. Yet this year, not a single Russian television station marked the anniversary. The decision to ignore the centennial arose from a meeting at the Kremlin last year, in which Russian President Vladimir Putin told his advisors that it would be unnecessary to commemorate it. Instead, the occasion should be discussed “only by experts,” he reportedly said. That is, let the experts, the historians, discuss the Revolution; the rest of Russia shouldn’t concern itself with such matters. This order was then conveyed by Sergei Kirienki, the Kremlin’s new political strategist, to the directors of Russia’s state media companies. Russia doesn’t need revolutions—it needs stability, he said, according to those who attended these meetings. The collapse of empire had become taboo for Russian media, and apparently a negligible historical footnote for Putin.

This post contains spoilers for the series finale of Big Little Lies. And so it ends, as it should, not with a bang but a thud. Well, presumably several thuds, receding in proximity but increasing in stickiness. The mystery is solved: A wife-beater on the verge of transitioning to homicide is instead dead at the hands of a group of women brought together in victimization and mutual support. And with that, Big Little Lies, which began as a show about rich, catty moms trying to score social points against one another by manipulating children’s birthday parties and the like, completes its evolution into something much richer and more resonant. I’ll confess, my wife and I saw this coming. (Well, mostly she did, but I adopted her predictions immediately.) As various other tensions and conflicts wound down or petered out, the story of Celeste’s abuse by Perry became the central narrative engine of the show. Yes, tonight’s finale tried to keep a few of the red herrings swimming—Gordon threatened Jane (and Tom!) at the café; Ed spilled a drink on Bonnie; Nathan sang way better than he was supposed to—but it was increasingly clear where this was headed.

Derek Thompson As students around the country await admissions decisions, let’s remember what America’s top colleges are for—and whom they could really help. This time of year, thousands of college applicants await e-notices and auspiciously sized envelopes from schools, under terrible pressure from their parents, friends, teachers, and fretful inner-monologues. To this anxious lot, I offer some advice, which comes not only from a bit of experience, but also a bit of empirical research: just chill out, okay? Many parents and students think there is a world of difference between the lifelong outcomes of (a) an A-minus student who gets into, say, Princeton, and (b) an A-minus student who applies to Princeton but “only” gets into some less selective school, like Penn State or the University of Wisconsin. They assume that a decision made by faceless adjudicators in Ivy League cloisters will mark the difference between success and failure in life.

On Wednesday, the British government began the formal process of exiting the European Union. In a speech to the House of Commons in London, Prime Minister Theresa May said that invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty was a “historic moment, from which there can be no turning back” and “a great turning point in our national story.” For once, May was right. Brexit does indeed mark a momentous point of no return for Britain. But the truth is that she cannot possibly deliver on her 12-point list of priorities for Brexit, which includes building a fairer society, spreading economic opportunity, and facilitating “a smooth, orderly” transition out of the EU. With fresh demands for a second independence referendum in Scotland and a fracturing peace process in Northern Ireland to contend with, it’s far more likely that May’s first order of business will be crisis control.

THE HISTORY Of computers is often told as a history of objects, from the abacus to the Babbage engine up through the code-breaking machines of World War II. In fact, it is better understood as a history of ideas, mainly ideas that emerged from mathematical logic, an obscure and cult-like discipline that first developed in the 19th century. Mathematical logic was pioneered by philosopher-mathematicians, most notably George Boole and Gottlob Frege, who were themselves inspired by Leibniz’s dream of a universal “concept language,” and the ancient logical system of Aristotle. Listen to the audio version of this article:Download the Audm app for your iPhone to listen to more titles. Mathematical logic was initially considered a hopelessly abstract subject with no conceivable applications. As one computer scientist commented: “If, in 1901, a talented and sympathetic outsider had been called upon to survey the sciences and name the branch which would be least fruitful in [the] century ahead, his choice might well have settled upon mathematical logic.” And yet, it would provide the foundation for a field that would have more impact on the modern world than any other. Continue Reading REUTERS/Andrew Kelly The Republican Identity Crisis McKay Coppins A conservative by any other name would still be confused about where they fall on the ideological spectrum in the Trump era. These are confusing times to be a Republican. For the past several decades, members of the GOP have mapped the ideological range found within their party onto a fairly straightforward spectrum—one that runs from “moderate” to “conservative.” The formulation was simplistic, of course, but it provided a useful shorthand in assessing politicians, and in explaining one’s own political orientation. A small-government culture warrior in Arizona would be situated on the far-right end of the spectrum; a pro-choice Chamber of Commerce type in Massachusetts might place himself on the other end. And across the country, there were millions of people—from officeholders to ordinary Republican voters—who identified somewhere between those two poles.

In the days after the 2016 election, an article by David Wong on Cracked called “How Half of America Lost Its F**king Mind” went viral. It listed five reasons why the Donald Trump phenomenon was explicable not by red vs. blue but rural vs. urban, and it relied heavily on pop culture to make its case. “Every TV show is about L.A. or New York, maybe with some Chicago or Baltimore thrown in,” he wrote from downstate Illinois. “When they did make a show about us, we were jokes—either wide-eyed, naive fluffballs (Parks And Recreation, and before that, Newhart) or filthy murderous mutants (True Detective, and before that, Deliverance). You could feel the arrogance from hundreds of miles away.” That tension between city-dwellers and country-dwellers runs so high these days—and is so front and center in the political conversation—contributes to the suspense of the gripping new podcast S-Town. “S-Town” stands for “Shit Town,” the term applied to the Alabama burg of Woodstock throughout the seven-episode documentary series from the creators of Serial and This American Life. Reporter Brian Reed heads there from New York City off a tip that there’s been a covered-up murder; his investigation encounters meth use, open racism, and devastating poverty—realities that pop culture so frequently uses as grist. The series shifts shape time and time again but one constant is the dynamic of Reed’s crisp, radio-ready tones contrasting with the drawls and profanity of the people he meets.

Photo: AP Topic Apple Going local: how Apple got back into Indonesia’s smartphone game The company’s planned US$44 million R&D facility is a small price to pay to take part in Southeast Asia’s largest economy By Resty Woro Yuniar 2 Apr 2017 Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Share on LinkedIn Share on Google Plus Share on Sina 0Comments Apple is investing in a research and development facility in Indonesia. Photo: AFP The resumption of iPhone sales in Indonesia is being lauded as a boon not only for consumers – but as a milestone in the country’s efforts to become Southeast Asia’s top tech investment destination and a demonstration of what governments can achieve in demanding firms “go local”. Apple officially resumed iPhone sales this week at six retailers across major cities in the country, after months of being barred from the market, having won over Indonesian authorities with a commitment to building a US$44 million research and development facility in Southeast Asia’s largest economy. That sweetener was enough to meet “local content” regulations that have since January required all 4G handsets to feature local content of at least 30 per cent – a rule that can be met in terms of hardware, software or (as in Apple’s case) an investment commitment. “Apple can now sell smartphones in Indonesia because it has committed to invest here,” said I Gusti Putu Suryawirawan, the director general of electronics at the industry ministry. Apple plans to build three innovation centres in Indonesia over the next three years. The first facility in Tangerang, on the outskirts of Jakarta, will start operating at the end of the second quarter this year and will employ up to 400 staff, according to the ministry. The tech giant’s re-entry into the Indonesian market is a key victory in Jakarta’s three-year battle to encourage foreign firms to take a greater stake in developing its phone manufacturing industry. Those efforts have in the past had mixed success. The government introduced the “Made in Indonesia” rules in 2014. In their early version, the rules focused heavily on requiring firms to set up local manufacturing facilities and left little room for flexibility. That caught many foreign vendors off guard: China’s Oneplus reacted by exiting the market in 2015, while Xiaomi responded by disabling the 4G capability on its Redmi Note 3 Pro phones. But since then, companies have slowly adjusted as the government has introduced more ways of compliance, such as investment. As a consequence, 65 per cent of the mobile phones sold in the country of 250 million people are now manufactured domestically, according to the Hong Kong-based research firm Counterpoint. Global brands that have set up facilities in Indonesia include BlackBerry, Samsung, Huawei, and Lenovo. Xiaomi announced last month it was ready to assemble phones in the city of Batam, some 1,000km from Jakarta, employing 1,200 workers to produce 500,000 smartphones per month. “There are 34 brands that have made phones in 20 facilities in Indonesia,” Suryawirawan of the industry ministry said. Overall, analysts estimate Indonesia had a capacity output of 39 million units last year. Other Asian countries have also introduced policies to boost their positions in the global smartphone value chain. India’s similar “Made in India” regulations help it earn investments from Chinese smartphone makers such as Xiaomi and Lenovo. Apple is also reportedly looking to make the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S models at its facility in Bangalore. While the policy has boosted investment into Indonesia’s smartphone industry, analysts said the country’s manufacturing ecosystem was still not as developed as in neighbouring Vietnam, Southeast Asia’s phone manufacturing hub that hosts facilities run by the world’s largest smartphone maker, Samsung. Phone-component shipments into Indonesia were valued at US$379 million in the first half of 2016, exceeding the total value for all of 2015, which stood at US$202 million, underlining how companies still import parts from first-tier suppliers in countries like China or Vietnam due to weak supply-chain ecosystems. As is probably true for its competitors, Apple’s latest investment in Indonesia could prove strategic; the nation is poised to be the world’s fourth-largest smartphone market by 2020 with nearly US$1 billion in total sales, according to research firm Euromonitor International. Apple’s share in the market was less than 1 per cent in the fourth quarter last year, according to International Data Corporation, leaving plenty of room for growth – Indonesia’s middle class is expected to grow in the next few years. “While the move may not yield immediate results ... in the long term it gives Apple an opportunity to understand closely the changing device trends [in Indonesia] where smartphone penetration by users is still around 45 per cent,” said Tarun Pathak, senior analyst at Counterpoint. Why Chinese phone makers find India a good call To comply with the regulations, Apple appears to have picked the investment route that requires companies to spend at least 550 billion rupiah (US$41 million) in Indonesia to automatically clear the 30 per cent threshold. Firms choosing this avenue need to carry out their investments within a year and renew the commitment annually – failure to comply would cause annual sales permits to be revoked. Apple had pledged to invest in the country until 2019, officials said. Next year, that threshold will rise to 40 per cent. Uber, Grab refuse to yield to taxis, from Jakarta to Bangkok Analysts said that tax incentives and business-friendly policies that favoured exports to other regions could help Asian countries attract investments from smartphone companies. Vietnam, for example, is offering tax incentives such as a 30-year tax holiday that puts just a 10 per cent tariff on mobile phone manufacturing, and a VAT exemption on technology transfers. “The underlying trend is that the biggest countries in Asia outside China are all looking to boost their domestic manufacturing,” Counterpoint’s Pathak said. “We estimate there will be a very strong competition between India, Indonesia and Vietnam to be an export hub.” ■ Resty Woro Yuniar recent articles Would a fatwa stop Indonesia’s ‘fake news’? 24 Mar 2017 1 Comments Ride-sharers refuse to yield to taxis on streets of Jakarta, Bangkok 20 Mar 2017 1 Comments Newsletter Sign-up Asian insights and analysis direct to your inbox.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Monday April 3, 2017 News Local News Larger / SmallerNight Mode Apple festival’s juicy success Elanor Watt 2 Apr 2017, 10:57 a.m. Crowds flock to Spreyton for a slice of the Apple Festival. The pick your nose game stall, the food and the cook-off were some the highlights from this year’s Spreyton Primary School Apple Festival, according to school principal Toni Douglas. “The pick your nose stall, featuring a giant paper mache nose that you can pick prizes out of, is something you do not have to spend a lot of money on to get some enjoyment out of, and the cook-off between Ben Milbourne and Devonport Mayor Steve Martin was very popular as well,” she said. FRESH PRODUCE: Amelia Willis, of Shearwater, enjoyed a fresh Spreyton apple at the Spreyton Primary School Apple Festival. Picture: Elanor Watt The former MasterChef contestant cooked up a rhubarb and apple crumble out of the mystery box ingredients given to the two on the day and Alderman Martin made a vegetarian stir fry with crispy skin salmon. Mrs Douglas said the new attractions, stalls and entertainment enticed people from across the Coast to get a taste of the action. “The weather was perfect, the crowds came and kept coming, probably a few more than what we have had in previous years, and I suspect it was because of a combination of a beautiful day and also the number of activities on offer,” she said. Mrs Douglas said she thought the school was just as crowded as it had ever been on Sunday and they were on target to raise as much money as previous years. “We rely on this to raise the funds we need for all sorts of resources for our school and our students – things we wouldn’t be able to buy otherwise,” she said. “I would like to thank our organisers who put it all together, along with the staff and volunteers  - we are really lucky to have such a positive and supportive community and thanks to them for coming out and making the day a success.” Click here to see snaps from the festival.

Ciara Lee reports. Video Transcript A bite size victory... in a global fight. Apple has won its bid to stop banks from introducing their own contactless payment services on its devices in Australia. The decision by Australia's competition watchdog, the first of its kind, will stop the banks from introducing their own mobile applications on iPhones and Apple Watches. The banks had hoped to avoid transaction fees and get customers to engage more frequently with their own apps. And that would have been lucrative. Australia's contactless payment market is worth an estimated $84 billion a year. The banks involved - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac, National Australia Bank and Bendigo & Adelaide Bank- have yet to allow use of their cards with Apple Pay. A win for them would have given them more negotiating power. A loss, making them potentially vulnerable to higher Apple fees. (SOUNDBITE) (English) CMC MARKETS, MARKET ANALYST, MICHAEL HEWSON, SAYING: "Ultimately these four banks, by adopting a court case against Apple, could well find that it actually becomes more expensive for them to actually gain access to Apple's devices. So I think on a long-term basis, this is probably good for Apple, probably not so good for the Australian Banks in the short term." A win might also have sparked similar appeals for access to Apple's systems in other parts of the world. Apple does not allow any of its 3,500 bank partners in 15 global markets access to the technology behind its payment system.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 April 2017 by Military News Apple Makes a Smart Move to Expand in This Huge Market Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has made headlines this year for a flurry efforts to tap the potentially fertile Indian smartphone market. Earlier in 2017, Cupertino executives reportedly met with Indian government officials to discuss duty concessions that would allow it to set up local iPhone assembly operations, followed by reports that it will start manufacturing the iPhone SE there in April. These moves make it clear that it has set into motion a chain of events to make a dent in this market, where annual smartphone sales could double to 200 million by 2020, according to Euromonitor International. It’s no surprise that the latest Apple/India news is that the company has decided to aggressively expand its retail presence to grab a larger slice of India’s smartphone market. The Economic Times reports that Apple has set up „over 100” franchised stores in India and is looking at a big expansion of that number. Why Apple needs a stronger retail presence in India Apple’s global popularity hasn’t penetrated the Indian market, with Morgan Stanley in May of last year putting its brand awareness at a distant 10th position in India. The Cupertino-based smartphone giant trailed even BlackBerry , Sony , and domestic smartphone manufacturers in terms of popularity. Samsung reportedly became India’s largest single-brand retailer, with more than 2,100 stores, in 2015, and it has continued its expansion. Its service network now covers over 6,000 districts across 29 states, giving it an edge over the likes of Apple when it comes to after-sales service. What’s more, even China’s Oppo was ahead of Apple in terms of smartphone sales by value, with an estimated 8% of the market in August 2016 as compared to the iPhone maker’s 5.6%, driven by an aggressive offline sales strategy. The Chinese smartphone company aims to open 35,000 points of sale in India, along with 180 service centers. It has brought famous film stars on board, and has sponsored widely watched sports tournaments to push its brand in the Indian market and grow sales. The good news is that Apple is now taking a leaf from its competitors’ playbook. An Economic Times report says that the iPhone maker has set up around 100 small stores in India based on a franchise model. These stores will be branded as „Apple Authorized Resellers” and will be 450 to 500 square feet in size, according to the publication. What’s more, Apple is reportedly planning a sixfold expansion of these outlets next year in a bid to shore up its retail presence in the country. This is a smart thing to do, considering the progress that its rivals have made with their offline sales channels. Additionally, CEO Tim Cook believes that opening company-owned stores will be Apple’s long-term play in this market, and could help enhance the company’s brand. Another potential catalyst Apple will need to make its phones more affordable to drive popularity in India, making the iPhone SE one of its most important models for this market. The iPhone SE was recently retailing for as low as INR 19,999 (approximately $306 at the current exchange rate) for the 16 GB variant, putting the device in the mid-range segment of the market. This price included a limited-time, cash-back offer that was available to some purchasers. It looks as if Apple is clearing its iPhone SE inventory before an expected production ramp-up of the device in India. Image source: Apple. Mid-range smartphone sales are growing at a fast clip in India, along with a rise in the average selling price. The latest data from CyberMedia Research indicates that the average selling price of a smartphone in India rose 25% year over year in the first quarter of 2016, thanks to increasing demand for features and quality. Apple’s strategy of offering a sub-$400 smartphone through the offline channel clearly indicates that it is trying to drive foot traffic into its stores. It can then work its way up the value chain in the Indian market, as smartphone sales rise and consumer spending grows , paving the way for stronger revenue from this emerging market. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 April 2017 by Military News 3 Top Apple Suppliers to Buy in 2017 Strong earnings growth and the dominance of the iPhone, which more than 700 million consumers use worldwide, have combined to help Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)  stock rise more than 900% in the past decade. Apple is the largest company to trade on any U.S. stock exchange by market cap, and it has by far the most cash of any public company. It’s using that cash pile to make huge investments in research and development. But we’re not going to talk here about Apple. I want to focus instead on what companies have been benefiting from Apple’s success as they help supply the parts and services necessary for Apple’s continued growth. Here, then, are three key Apple suppliers that could also make top stocks for 2017. Image source: Apple. Micron Technology Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU)  is a semiconductor manufacturer that makes products for computers, consumer electronics, the automotive industry, industrial applications, and more. The company supplies the internal processing power of iPhones and other Apple products. Micron’s stock was a great performer in 2016, gaining more than 50% during the year, and looks on track to continue gaining in 2017. Micron’s NAND products, which are advanced rewritable memory devices, seem to have huge potential as cloud computing continues to grow, which could help to diversify and grow sales in the coming quarters. In its most recent quarter, Micron’s sales rose 58% year over year. The company does face some risks, including an increasing threat from major players in the field, including Intel . It also faces volatility in the prices for its products, the same thing that’s sent the stock tumbling in the past. In addition, Micron’s CEO recently announced his retirement, and so far a replacement hasn’t been named. It should also be noted that Micron stock is still off its November 2014 high, which was followed by more than a 70% drop over the next 18 months. Still, analysts expect Micron’s earnings to continue growing quickly, and the stock price looks attractive at less than 6 times forward earnings estimates. Texas Instruments Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN)  is an advanced semiconductor maker that makes chips and processors, including various components of Apple’s iPhone and iPad. The company recently got a major operational boost when it moved to a new type of chip for one of its main products that reduced production costs significantly — as much as 40%. For the full year of 2016, sales rose only about 3%, but earnings per share grew nearly 24%. The company showed strong momentum within its auto and industrial segments, two areas the company has been investing heavily in, and which seems to be paying off now. Sales are climbing faster now than they did in 2016, and management has guided for Q1 sales of as much as $3.43 billion, compared with $3 billion during the prior-year period. As for the stock’s valuation, it looks relatively cheap in its industry, trading at just 23 times earnings. It also comes with a nice 2.5% yield that’s grown very consistently over the past decade and is likely to continue growing, as the company has a payout ratio of less than 50% and strong cash flow. The progression of iPhone generations. The iPhone 8 is expected in fall 2017. Image source: Apple. Broadcom Last, but certainly not least, is Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , which, following the 2016 merger with fellow semiconductor behemoth Avago, is a $94 billion company by market cap. Broadcom is a major supplier of wireless chips used in the iPhone, and there’s been speculation lately that Broadcom and Apple are working together on wireless-charging technology that could be in the iPhone 8, expected to be released later this year. That would be a major positive development for both companies. Thanks to the merger, Broadcom’s 2017 sales are likely to grow substantially from last year, but expect that growth to continue as the company expands its market share. The company’s long-term earnings growth potential looks even better, as it’s expected to grow around 15% annually over the next five years. While the stock looks expensive because of the cost of the acquisition, it’s trading at just 14 times forward earnings estimates, and it also pays a 2% dividend yield. Is it a good idea to invest in companies that might ride Apple’s coattails, or is it better to just invest in Apple itself? That’s a fair question, as Apple already looks like one of the best stocks to own in 2017 , and betting on its suppliers has been a gamble in years past. Apple has a history of squeezing suppliers on prices to protect its own margin, while new entrants in the chip space have left some companies with questionable growth prospects. However, each of the companies we’ve looked at have many more buyers than just Apple, and each also has its own unique growth prospects. Therefore, it wouldn’t be a bad strategy to consider both Apple and these suppliers as good stocks to own going forward. 10 stocks we like better than Texas Instruments When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Originally introduced as a feature exclusive to the iPad Pro, Apple boasts that the technology takes advantage of four-channel ambient light sensors “to automatically adapt the color and intensity of the display to match the light in your environment.” The end result is a display with more natural color tones, making for a more comfortable viewing experience in the process. Don't Miss: Using my iPhone for the next six months is really, really going to suck Barclays’ research note, originally obtained via MacRumors, reads in part: For the expected iPhone 7S models, as well as the iPhone 8, we think ams’s content increases due to the inclusion of its full spectral sensing ambient light sensor, as already seen in the iPad Pro for that device’s True Color screen functionality. We estimate this to be a material step-up in content from the $0.60 range to $1.00. Coupled with the edge to edge OLED display that will reportedly grace the iPhone 8, Apple’s flagship iPhone 8 this year will assuredly boast the most advanced display we’ve seen to date from Apple’s venerable iPhone. All the same, don’t expect the iPhone 8 to feature a curved display a’la the Samsung Galaxy S8. As we noted earlier today, Apple’s next-gen iPhone may feature a slight curve but won’t come close to matching what Samsung pulled off with its S8 lineup. Display technology aside, Apple’s iPhone 8 is shaping up to be a monster of a device that will undoubtedly usher in the most dramatic iPhone upgrade cycle we’ve seen to date. Some of the device’s rumored features include wireless charging, a blazing fast A11 processor, improved water and dust resistance, and much improved battery life. What’s more, the iPhone 8 will reportedly include a number of advanced 3D cameras that will presumably be used for facial recognition and augmented reality purposes. As far as storage is concerned, Apple with the iPhone 8 will finally start giving users more bang for their buck with 64GB said to be the storage option on the entry level model.

Apple's strategy of offering a sub-$400 smartphone through the offline channel clearly indicates that it is trying to drive foot traffic into its stores. It can then work its way up the value chain in the Indian market, as smartphone sales rise and consumer spending grows, paving the way for stronger revenue from this emerging market.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive A Dancer's Pointe expands its artistic offerings Saturday Apr 1, 2017 at 6:51 PM Apr 1, 2017 at 6:51 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — A Dancer’s Pointe Performing Arts Center has planned a grand opening to celebrate the expansion of its services in the form of a newly renovated music and vocal studio. The event — scheduled for 4:30 p.m. Monday — will serve as a meet-and-greet for prospective students, who will have a chance to mingle with the center’s new piano, vocal and guitar instructors, as well as Apple Valley Mayor Scott Nassif. Co-owner Linda Hanley said until the expansion, the performing arts aspect of A Dancer’s Pointe was geared solely toward dance. “We eventually wanted it to become a performing arts center,” Hanley told the Daily Press, “and now we’re hoping our studio will foster all the arts in the High Desert.” Hanley and fellow co-owner Pam Cambridge worked for the previous owner until they purchased the center in 1999, and now — with the recent expansion into the suite adjacent to the dance studio — they’re excited for the new classes that will bolster the center’s artistic offerings. “With dance, I love to give back to the community,” Hanley said. “Now we’re doing it again with music. When children have something the love, it builds passion and that translates to their studies. And music can turn a bad day into a happy one.” Hanley’s husband, Thomas, worked for two months to renovate the suite formerly occupied by CCE Guns & Accessories. He constructed new walls and soundproofed three new rooms to personalize the students’ experience during lessons with instructors who will offer flexible schedules. Linda Hanley started playing music when she was 8 and believes the power of music exists everywhere. “My generation started young,” she said. “It was a big deal. We need to foster that more. I’m really big on Apple Valley and it’s great to give back to the community like this.” A Dancer’s Pointe Performing Arts Center is located at 18355 Highway 18.

The iPhone 5 is getting older which puts a greater importance on each update Apple releases for the former flagship. iOS updates for older devices can have a dramatic impact on performance. Sometimes its positive. Sometimes, unfortunately, its negative. Apple’s latest update to the iPhone 5 is a huge milestone upgrade. Its much larger than the iOS 10.2.1 update that came before it. If you’re making the move to iOS 10.3 from the iOS 10.2.1 update, your iOS 10.3 update will be substantial, several hundred megabytes. If you’re coming from something older than iOS 10.2.1 you can expect your update to be even bigger thanks to the features and fixes from previous iOS upgrades. They are baked into the iPhone 5’s iOS 10.3 update. This roundup will take you through our impressions of the iPhone 5 iOS 10.3 update’s performance and it will guide you through some of the key things to keep in mind as we push toward Apple’s next iOS 10 release. We’ll continue to update this roundup with new details as we get them so keep an eye out for frequent changes. iPhone 5 iOS 10.3 Update: Impressions & Performance   1 / 9 The iPhone 5 iOS 10.3 update is a big one and it'll only take you some time to download and install. It took us about seven minutes to download the update over a fast Wi-Fi speed network. It took a lot longer to install. Due to the file system change and the other features on board iOS 10.3, the iPhone 5's new software update took upwards of 15 minutes to install on our device. That's abnormal for an iOS update and it means you'll need to pay extra attention to the installation process.  We recommend setting aside 30 quiet minutes where you can monitor both the download and installation without distractions. Moving onto the update's performance.  We've been using the iPhone 5 iOS 10.3 update for a few days now and the update has been pretty impressive. We're using an aging AT&T model.  The iPhone 5's battery continues to work miracles. We haven't noticed any abnormal battery drain during our time with iOS 10.3 though that could certainly change down the road. If you do notice weird battery drain, take a look at our list of tips. Chances are, it's not iOS 10.3 causing the problems. We've tested the iPhone 5 and its new update with several different ISPs, routers and Bluetooth devices. We haven't noticed any major issues during our time with the upgrade. AT&T's LTE and 4G networks are working fine as well.  Random reboots were an issue for us on iOS 10.2 but we haven't noticed any during our time on iOS 10.3. That's a big improvement, for us at least.  The most noticeable change, outside of the new features, is to the speed of the device's user interface. Animations and transitions are fast and fluid and we haven't experienced any lag when opening up Control Center.  We also haven't noticed any lag when opening up and closing folders, something we did see on iOS 10.2.1. The movement is crisp. There's still some jaggedness when opening up some apps but hey, this phone is going on five years old. If you're already on iOS 10.2.1, iOS 10.3's features, fixes and security patches definitely make it worth a look. You could also see a boost to your device's performance.  If you're on something older than the iOS 10.2.1 update, make sure you dig into more feedback before you make the jump to iOS 10.3.  For more on the merits of iOS 10.3, see our list of reasons to and not to install the iOS 10.3 update on your iPhone.   1 / 9 6 Responses 12/19/2016 Facebook lite apk Reply i like ios 10.2 more than 10.1. power berry slow lost 02/24/2017 Kent Reply After installing 10.2.1 on my iPhone 5s I started getting random reboots. At least 10 per day. If plugged into the charger, the reboots seemed to go away. 02/27/2017 Jarvis Reply Hi guys, I am using iPhone 5s with ios 9.3.3. I am getting reminders to update to whitetail 10.2.1 I’m not sure though, if I should go for an update or not since Internet is poisoned about 30% battery bug in ios 10. I’m new to iPhone, have almost no past experience of ios. As of now I am pretty satisfied with ios 9.3.3 just sometimes it becomes difficult to click on( x) while trying to close search box with some other minor hiccups, don’t know if it’s a software issue or hardware on my device. I’m kinda liking the health app. Although it is not measuring the floors climbed while it’s counting the steps taken. I am told it will count the floors climbed after I updated to 10.2.1 which kind of sounds weird. Please suggest me the right course of action. By the way what’s Jailbreak? Hoping to hear from you soon. 03/03/2017 Natasha Reply Updated to 10.2.1 yesterday and my phone wont start at all and has been at the Apple logo + loading bar screen for over 24 hours. :( 03/21/2017 Simone Reply I’ve been using iOS 10.2.1 on my iPhone 5c and I’m having really abnormal battery life it’s chargimg really fast and then when I use it for about 10 minutes it’ll go down by 20% I’ve restated and rebooted my phone but my battery life is still really abnormal please fix this 04/01/2017 Rick Devereux Reply I’m wondering if the disappearance of my toolkit with calculaor, flashlight, etc that used appear on first opening with an UP Slide before entering passcode had anything to do with the 10.2.1 software? The only thing I get now when I Up Slide on opening is a Music tool that does absolutely nothing for me as I don’t keep music on this phone. I can’t get rid of it no matter what I try, and I don’t know where to find the calculator, flashlight etc. I feel like I Apple just took my Swiss Army knife. grrr.

This tenth anniversary device will have to answer to a Galaxy S8 release that has delivered arguably the most innovative package that Samsung has ever produced. Thus, it is not surprising that rumors about this critical hardware release are already multiplying rapidly. Ultrasonic sensor The Galaxy S8 is notable for its radical design, and a new patent suggests that Apple may also introduce innovative new features into the iPhone 8. The document indicates that Apple is considering replacing the Touch ID system with an ultrasonic sensor, which will deliver two main advantages over the existing system. cicwdn / Pixabay Apple firstly suggests that the new technology would be unaffected by contaminants such as greece, lotion, and sweat. This is naturally a massive problem; who hasn’t attempted to utilize their iPhone on a crowded beach having applied sunscreen and encountered difficulties? The second advantage, as the consumer electronics giant sees it, is that the new technology will no longer struggle with too much or too little pressure influencing the quality of fingerprinting garnered. There is no news on where this technology could be manufactured for the iPhone 8, but it is possible that Apple could recruit Qualcomm in order to deliver this. Ceramic design Other reports this week suggest that there will be a third iPhone 8 unit released by Apple later this year. This would be a landmark in the iPhone range, as the Californian corporation has never previously released three handsets simultaneously. And the latest leaks suggest that this third iPhone device could actually be ceramic, at least if a report authored by Fast Company is to be believed. This ceramic device would cost in excess of $1,000, with Fast Company describing it as “something like a smooth black monolith, with few visual interruptions to its sleek design”. There still seems to be some disagreement over whether or not all models in the iPhone 8 series will benefit from OLED technology, or whether it will merely be the premium version. But there is broad agreement that this third version of the iPhone 8 will indeed diverge from LCD. Japanese website Mac Otakara is one of the sources suggesting that the most premium and newest features in the iPhone 8 will only be applied to a new version. The East Asian source suggests that this smartphone will be branded as the iPhone 8 Edition, just as Apple released a premium Apple Watch Edition previously. However, this publication also explodes the idea that Apple will release three models simultaneously, instead suggesting that the iPhone edition could be released several months after the standard iPhone 8 handset. 3D sensing linked Elsewhere, rumors of 3D sensing features being included in the next generation of iPhone continue to accelerate. Taiwanese Himax Technologies has reportedly been recruited by Apple in order to form part of the supply chain for the iPhone 8, with the company responsible for providing glass for a module constructed by Lumentum. It is believed that Lumentum, a component supplier, will provide the 3D sensing models to be utilized in the iPhone 8, with the front camera then delivering both 3D sensing and 3D modelling capabilities. Facial recognition will be a natural fit for this technology, while augmented reality and virtual reality functions will also likely feature. Tim Cook has previously spoken of the potential of augmented reality for the iPhone range. According to Digitimes, the module being developed will use technology known as vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser-based DOE (diffractive optical elements). A bit of a mouthful, I’m sure you’d agree! Chip-on-glass construction will also be utilized, with Himax and ChipMOS also involved in the process. This latest report is rather timely, as it follows on the back of Morgan Stanley analyst Charlie Chan writing on the possibility of Himax being involved in the Apple supply chain for the iPhone 8. Other reports suggest that innovative technology developed by the company has the ability to reduce the size of 3D sensing components, making them more suitable for mobile products. Wraparound display Following on from the release of the Galaxy S8, it know seems extremely unlikely that the iPhone 8 will feature a similar wraparound display. Infamous Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has previously indicated his belief that the forthcoming Apple mobile will feature an edge-to-edge screen, enabling the Cupertino-based manufacturer to slim down the bezels included in the iPhone 8 significantly. Kuo also believes that Apple will be increasing the screen size of the iPhone 8 to approximately 5.8-inches, which would make perfect sense after Samsung showed off its latest 5.8-inch S8 release. If Apple does indeed release three models of the iPhone 8 in September, it is likely that the other two releases will retain the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays used in previous iPhone series. There is no word on branding as of yet, but these could also be named differently to the iPhone 8 module, possibly as the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. Wireless charging There is also good reason to believe that Apple will include wireless charging technology in the iPhone 8. One interesting morsel of information that has slid under the radar to some extent was the Californian corporation joining the Wireless Power Consortium just weeks ago. This organisation is responsible for overseeing standards involved with wireless charging technology, indicating that Apple may be about to produce devices that can be charged wirelessly for the first time. Meanwhile, although Apple is expected to embrace curved screen technology in the iPhone 8 generation, its approach may be slightly different to its Korean rival. JP Morgan analyst Rod Hall suggests that the screen in the tenth anniversary iPhone will be slightly less curved that the Galaxy S8, with Hall writing that “current indications are for less use of curved OLED which may result in a slightly less ‘infinity’ screen form factor.” UPDATE: 03-24-2017: We are well accustomed by now to seeing huge queues for new iPhone releases. And this may be even more prominent with the release of the iPhone 8, following news which has emerged this week. Paltry stock Three iPhone releases are expected in September, with the iPhone 8 been accompanied by two iPhone 7S models. But a new report suggests that the initial stock of the iPhone 8 will be so minimal that consumers can expect it to sell out almost immediately once preorders begin. It is noted that production for certain components to be utilized in the iPhone 8 can only commence in the third quarter, suggesting that Apple is likely to have enough stock to meet demand when the device launches. Image Source: iphone8plus.com This prediction is contained in a major new research note from the investment bank Barclays. It suggests that the majority of iPhone 8 stock may not be available until later in Q4. “Suppliers generally had good things to say about the upcoming iPhone 8 launch (for our purposes iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and iPhone Pro) as new features drive a more complicated manufacturing process and higher 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7  - View Full Page Tags: Apple iPhone 8 Load Comments Send us your tips at tips(at)valuewalk.com Latest News From ValueWalk Following Sessions’ Threat, NYC No Longer a Sanctuary City The Lowest Risk Investment (part 2 of 2) – match time horizon, what returns can you make and how?

As MacRumors has covered over the past few years, tech companies love to prank their customers with silly products, out-there announcements, and largely weird press releases meant to highlight the jovial holiday. April 1, 2017 also marks the 41st anniversary of Apple, with Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne having solidified their partnership on this day all those years ago in 1976. Now, Apple itself has become a major target for April Fools' Day pranks, as well as various other companies, apps, services, and accessory makers that are well-known by Apple users. We have collected some of the more interesting hoaxes and jokes into a list below, but remember that some contain mildly NSFW content and language, so you may want to use headphones or watch the videos in a private location. -Siri-Siri is recognizing April Fools' Day in some of its responses today, including refusing to flip a coin upon request.-iFixit's Micro Tech Toolkit-iFixit has announced an all-new toolkit that it says is aimed at the smallest devices on the market, including the Apple Watch and AirPods. The $19.95 Micro Tech Toolkit comes with a magnetized driver handle, easy-to-open tool roll, micro pliers, micro spudger, an iFixit micro opening tool, and three precision bits. Thanks to the vast array of tools being sold on iFixit's online store, the Micro Tech Toolkit is at first a somewhat believable offering from the teardown site. For anyone not yet convinced of its status as an April Fools' Day prank, however, the accompanying launch video has testimony from iFixit's Micro Tech Tool Expert -- Howard the Hamster. Additionally, one repair story on the toolkit's storefront written by Ralph the Mouse appears to be a reference to Beverly Cleary's popular children's book The Mouse and the Motorcycle. -Ms. Pac-Man in Google Maps-Beginning yesterday, users discovered that Google has added a functioning version of the classic video game Ms. Pac-Man directly into its iOS Google Maps app. You can now control Ms. Pac-Man and hunt for ghosts and pellets in a re-skin of the game that turns the streets of your local neighborhood into a maze of Ms. Pac-Man corridors.-Netflix Live-Netflix launched an all-new streaming show it's calling "Netflix Live," allowing customers to receive fascinating tidbits of information about copiers, toasters, and pencil sharpeners from actor Will Arnett. The popular streaming company claims that the "live" show is a new addition to its ever-growing stable of original content, but -- as many have figured out since yesterday -- it's yet another one of Netflix's April Fools' Day pranks. For the morbidly curious, you can watch the 48-minute, not-actually-live burrito commentary series right now on the Netflix streaming device of your choice. If it's anything like last year's John Stamos: A Human, Being "documentary," it probably won't be on the service for long. -AirRings-Twelve South has revealed "AirRings," which the company says will let you "effortlessly transform your AirPods into earrings." AirRings come in different styles for both men and women, including cuffs, bands and drop style earrings, so you can listen to your music on AirPods without sacrificing your style. -USB-Speed of Light by Moshi-If you're tired of the confusing array of USB-Type A and USB-Type C cables, Moshi today announced the one USB solution to end them all: USB-Speed of Light (USB-SL for short). The accessory manufacturer calls USB-SL "the next-next-generation in charging and connectivity," and should top off your MacBook Pro in mere seconds. With the additional USB-SL to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter "the future is truly and literally at your fingertips," providing an internet connection so fast you can catch up on your email and other notifications that have yet to arrive. Similarly, the USB-SL to HDMI Adapter provides the ultimate, crystal clear video experience "from any point in time." -Other Pranks, Jokes, and Hoaxes:- · The T-Mobile ONEsie - a full-body wearable that provides truly unlimited coverage · Google Gnome - a lawn gnome version of Google Home · Petlexa - Amazon Echo's Alexa now understands your pets We'll update this post throughout April Fools' Day in the event that any new pranks surface.Tag: April Fools' Day Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit Entertainment - 3 days ago< > Embed April Fools' Day Early Burger King Toothpaste 00:40 Burger King France got an early start to April Fools' by posting a video Wednesday advertising Whopper toothpaste.

Siri isn’t just about voice control. Apple uses Siri as the predictive engine behind apps in the Today screen and Apple is already using prediction in Messages with the QuickType keyboard that is able to pick up on your conversation style and offer up responses based on the conversation you are having. With iOS 11, you may see Siri come to new places on your phone and across your devices to make it easier to get things done. Expect to learn about iOS 11 in June and see it alongside an iPhone 8 in the fall. A major iOS 11 feature could upgrade Siri. A new report from The Verifier, outlines Apple’s rumored plans to add Siri to iMessage and iCloud. This would bridge the gap between your devices and allow Siri to be more useful on your iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. This new Siri iOS 11 feature could show up in iMessage to help you find answers to questions happening in the conversation. This could be about where to get lunch and then how to get there or a million other possibilities. With iMessage apps and Siri third-party access, this feature seems ready for introduction. Apple already holds a patent Siri in iMessage, which adds to the potential for this to come out this fall. With Siri iCloud integration you could see the predictive abilities of Siri that show you apps you might need on the Today screen expand to cover all of your devices. The report suggests that this will connect with the Mac and iOS devices to deliver actions . and suggestions no matter which device you use. Apple already uses Siri for predictive purposes. Apple added Siri to the Mac with macOS Sierra last fall and the company is already syncing tabs, documents, preferences and even AirPod connectivity across devices. Samsung is going big with a better personal assistant called Bixby on the Galaxy S8 and Google is now available on most Android phones. As Google and Amazon both take over your home with Google Home and the Echo with Alexa, Apple may be planning a takeover with new Siri integrations that sync between all of your devices. 8 iPhone 8 Features We Want in 2017 New iPhone 8 Design to Enable Features   1 / 8 Everyone wants a new iPhone 8 design, but most people don't know what changes they actually want. We're leading off our iPhone 8 feature wishlist with a new iPhone 8 design because it is a key part of enabling new iPhone 8 features. After sticking with a very similar design for three years there is an expectation of major changes for the 2017 iPhone and here are the things we would love to see Apple do with a new design. Shrink the overall size of the iPhone 8 Plus without lowering the screen size. Apple could do this by shrinking the bezels on the sides and bottom of the iPhone some to offer a smaller overall package. Apple could choose to change where you use Touch ID and how the home button works in new ways to make this happen. We definitely don't want a phone that is slim just to be slim, especially not at the price of battery life, but there is something to be said about an iPhone 8 design that trims some fat. The Jet Black iPhone 7 feels different than all the other colors. While it is more susceptible to scratches it is easier to grip, which is something we can definitely see Apple add to the new iPhone 8. KGI Securities Analyst Ming-Chi Kou predicts the iPhone 8 design will look include an all glass front and back with stainless steel metal on the edges of premium models. This could come together for an iPhone 8 design that looks like a cross between the iPhone 4s and the Jet Black iPhone 7.   1 / 8 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement iFixit: Apple’s new $329 iPad is basically an iPad Air 1, but 44 percent brighter 03/31/2017 at 9:58 AM by Brad Linder 2 Comments Apple’s new iPad may not be much of an upgrade from earlier Apple tablets, but with a starting price of $329, it is cheaper… and I suppose there’s something nice about getting the same hardware for a lower price. But the same hardware as what? According to the folks at iFixit, the new iPad is a lot like the original iPad Air under the hood… but it has a newer processor and a brighter screen. iFixit As a repair-focused company, iFixit points out that, like the original iPad Air, the new model has an unfused display assembly makes it easier and more affordable to fix a broken screen. Since the new tablet also has the same physical dimensions and uses some of the same connectors as the original, you can also can swap some parts: The iPad Air digitizer works in an iPad 5 The iPad 5 digitizer works in an iPad Air You can put the iPad 5 LCD in an iPad Air Both tablets also use the same 32.9 Wh batteries. And you can also put the iPad Air LCD into an iPad 5, but iFixit says the screen will be dim and the home button won’t work. Speaking of screen brightness though, iFixit does confirm Apple’s claim that the new screen is brighter. In fact, it’s 44 percent brighter than the original iPad Air’s screen. One other difference? The new model has an Apple A9 processor and 2GB of RAM, while the first-gen iPad Air had an A7 chip and 1GB of memory. But it’s worth pointing out that we’re comparing this tablet to a model that came out in late 2013. But a year later, Apple released the iPad Air 2 which is thinner, lighter, and has an Apple A8X processor. The transition from that model to the newest iPad is more of a lateral move (you get a slightly faster CPU and a brighter screen, but a thicker, heavier case and lose he laminated, antireflective display). On the bright side, not only is the new model cheaper, but I suspect we’ll see iPad Air 2 prices continue to fall on eBay now that Apple has lowered the price of an entry-level 9.7 inch iPad.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Mobile & Tabs No, Artificial Intelligence will not kill the smartphone: Apple’s Phil Schiller No, Artificial Intelligence will not kill the smartphone: Apple’s Phil Schiller Apple's Phil Schiller on why artificial intelligence-based assistants can't replace the mobile screen, just yet Written by Nandagopal Rajan | Bengaluru | Updated: April 3, 2017 10:46 am Apple’s Philip Schiller told indianexpress.com that even as artificial intelligence becomes better, the value of the screen will remain very strong in our lives. There has been far too much chatter on whether artificial intelligence and virtual reality could end up pushing the smartphone, which might still power them, into the background. However, not everyone seems to buy the argument that soon we will not the need a screen to interact with smart devices at all. Philip Schiller, the senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing at Apple, told indianexpress.com that even as voice interaction become more prevalent and artificial intelligence becomes better, the value of the screen will remain very strong in our lives. “I can ask Siri for directions, but seeing the map on the screen helps me understand where I am going,” he explained. He said photography, which was such an integral part of smartphone usage will still need the screen and the written word is also getting more popular. Plus, the gaming, the largest app category, also cannot exist without the screen. However, the apps on smartphones — a segment ushered in by Apple close to a decade ago with the launch of the iPhone — has the potential to change industries that have been around for centuries. “Every company, every business, every education institution has something to improve through software and applications,” Schiller said. He added that with smartphone technology and applications becoming so pervasive in our lives, there are two magical things happening. Also read: We don’t make products cheaper for specific markets: Apple’s Phil Schiller “One, there is a technology adoption by consumers at a scale seen never before — these are almost supercomputers in our pockets; and at the same time you have software that can transform everyday businesses and services that we all rely on in new ways.” In fact, he thinks they have the power to change societies and economies. “One of the huge opportunities is building through technology for people from diverse backgrounds to get opportunities that might not have existed in old industries. Men and women, people from different ethnic and economic backgrounds… there is a great levelling through apps and technology where none of that matters, what matters is how good is your idea, how good is the opportunity you want to create and that increases diversity and the creativity of people from different perspectives.” Schiller adds: “The whole world wins when that happens and the society can often change through that process.” Schiller says Apple sees this with its developer communities that reach people from all over the world. “They get to influence all of us. I think that is a big way that society changes.” He also underlines how software, “often best expressed as the apps on our devices”, has changed the way we interact with our governments, our places of work and places of education. “If you look at it at that scale, we have only just begun… the number of apps that are being created, the number of downloads and the amount of revenue being generated in this sector are all measures of this.” For all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd Tags: Apple artificial intelligence Best of Express J&K: Army jawan with two grenades arrested at Srinagar Airport, was heading to New Delhi EntertainmentIndian Idol 9 winner LV Revanth wins Rs 25 lakh, a car, a Bollywood career: 'My life has just begun' EntertainmentAashiqui star Anu Agarwal meets Aashiqui 2's Shraddha Kapoor as Vishesh Films complete 30 years EntertainmentSunil Grover will never return to Kapil Sharma Show even if Kapil mends his ways: Raju Srivastava EntertainmentPriyanka Chopra is world's second most beautiful woman, beats Angelina Jolie, Emma Stone Must Read SportsWrestleMania Results: Lesnar wins, Undertaker retires SportsAus’ DRS success rate dropped considerably: Saha SportsIn IPL, Rohit wants to put his season of injury behind TechnologyReliance Jio Prime's Summer Surprise: The terms and conditions to note TechnologySony Xperia XZs India launch today: Here's all you need to know TechnologyFive reasons why Samsung Galaxy S8 is not a great upgrade for S7 users LifestyleShooting with the stars Apr 03: Latest News MCD polls: Delhi High Court refuses common symbol to Swaraj India Iran releases 15 Indian fishermen: Sushma Swaraj Sania Mirza-Barbora Strycova stunned in Miami Open women’s doubles final China vows fresh smog crackdown as toxic air shrouds capital WWE WrestleMania 33: John Cena proposes to Nikki Bella in the ring, watch video Nandagopal RajanNandagopal Rajan is Editor New Media.

IMAGE: The new OnePlus ads indicate that the brand is hoping to walk the thin line between premium and mass market categories. Amitabh Bachchan as KBC anchor appeals to the masses. But the ads pitch OnePlus against Apple, Google and Samsung. Photograph: Kind Courtesy: OnePlus. When OnePlus signed Amitabh Bachchan as brand ambassador, there was little doubt that the Chinese phone maker would jog down the beaten track with high-pitched television and hoardings-led campaigns, just like other smartphone brands. The first ads are out and OnePlus has played to the script so far, swinging sharply away from its early days of a digital-only promotional strategy and referral purchases. While the company says this is the best way to tap into the potential of the 25-million-plus smartphone market in India (IDC, Q4 2016), experts ask whether this will help OnePlus make the transition from an exclusive and experential purchase to a mass-market brand. OnePlus believes it can, by spreading awareness about the phone and its features. Vikas Agarwal, general manager, OnePlus India says the brand is using Bachchan to do just that. As a mass market label, OnePlus wants to reach out to new target groups and geographies that have been left out of the brand’s digital net. Bachchan is popular across income and age groups and the brand hopes to ride on his appeal. Agarwal adds, while the company has a new advertising strategy and budget, it is sticking with its online-only sales strategy. OnePlus had created quite a stir with an ‘invite only’ promotional campaign at the time of its launch. The current campaign, Agarwal says, is essentially a scaled-up version of the same referral marketing. Bachchan and stand-up comedian Rohan Joshi of AIB have come together to launch a series of unique activations including a quiz show where Bachchan plays the role of contestant and declares OnePlus to be the best brand through an audience poll. Agarwal says that OnePlus is the third biggest brand in premium segment ($400 or above) in India and the company wanted to leverage the positive feedback shared by actual end users for the campaign. “The Best Smartphone Contest communicates this core message and recognises the contribution of the OnePlus community with rewards that include a grand prize of Rs 1 crore along with numerous other offers and a chance to meet Bachchan in person,” he adds. OnePlus is owned by a subsidiary of the Chinese phone maker BBK which also owns the Vivo and Oppo labels. Many believe that the strategy to go big with ad campaigns could also be an extension of a larger corporate strategy as both Oppo and Vivo are big advertisers. Agarwal looks at it differently. He explains that the referral strategy during the launch was a strategic one as is the current decision to shift into a mass market advertising plan. The company was unsure about the sales volumes when it was launching its phones and the invite system helped manage its supply chain. That it lured customers in with a unique purchase experience was a bonus. “As a new brand, we weren’t sure how well received our products would be. We used the referral system to match supply with fluctuating demand. Fortunately, the system worked well as it helped in keeping our inventory in check while creating a positive recommendation chain that quickly went viral. The invite system made our products exclusive and generated a lot of buzz,” says Agarwal. It is now time to scale up and improve brand awareness. Agarwal says that he wants the new campaign to educate users about the brand and the OnePlus community. “We have expanded the scope to penetrate new user groups and experiment with new marketing channels to check their effectiveness. We have roped in Amitabh Bachchan as he is one of the most consistent performers and is also tech savvy.” The new ads indicate that the brand is also hoping to walk the thin line between premium and mass market categories. Bachchan as KBC anchor appeals to the masses. But the ads pitch OnePlus against Apple, Google and Samsung, thereby positioning it within the premium category. Bachchan walks the same line as a superstar with mass appeal and “his personality resonates well with our brand mantra. With him on board, we are looking to expand our community,” adds Agarwal. IMAGE: Vikas Agarwal, GM, OnePlus India. Photograph: Kind courtesy @Vikas_AGL/Twitter. The company has invested in improving its supply chain and production capacity and has recently started making its phones in India. It adopted a similar strategy in other markets too; in Europe it partnered with carriers like O2 (UK) and Elisa (Finland) to make demand more predictable and stable. Now after three years with operations in over 30 countries, the company has dropped the invite-led sales strategy with the launch of the OnePlus 3 model late last year. However OnePlus plans to continue selling online, the only change being that it will now offer smartphones on its own e-commerce website. Can OnePlus move away from being an experiential purchase and a novelty for first time buyers to the conscious choice of feature-hungry smartphone users? Agarwal believes it can by keeping an unwavering eye on the product. “With a product first philosophy and one premium flagship smartphone a year strategy, our products are synonymous with our brand. Our constant endeavour is to offer the best device experience and improve engagement with our users. Since inception, our fans have been instrumental in refining products through constant feedback and driving word-of-mouth awareness,” says Agarwal. He is confident that the community-based brand philosophy will continue to drive sales, but then loyalty is a fickle friend in the mass market.

The latest rumours regarding Apple’s upcoming iPhone 7s and iPhone 8 suggest that Apple will be incorporating the iPad Pro’s True Tone capabilities. If you remember, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro introduced a True Tone mechanism where Apple used a more capable ambient light sensor to determine the colour and brightness of the ambient light and adjusted the display to suit it. The technology is best explained with an analogy. Take a piece of paper. It’s white under a tube-light, yellow under a yellow light and red under a red light. In the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, the colour tone of the display would change with the change in ambient light. It’s a subtle change to the way a display works, but experience tells us that it’s worth it. It’s not one of those must-have features, but once you get used to it, the lack of it can be quite a jarring experience. MacRumours got its hands on a report from Barclays which stated that the iPhone 7s, 7s Plus and 8 will have an Oled screen with a “full spectral sensing” ambient light sensor. Apparently, these will be sourced from AMS, an Austrian semiconductor company. Barclays estimates that the cost of the display units will go up by about $0.60 to $1.

Qualcomm Snapdragon 835: The first benchmark results - comparisons to Pixel, OnePlus 3T, Galaxy S7, and more David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/03/22 7:09am PDTMar 22, 2017 45 Plus 1 on G+ 283 Share on Facebook 95 Share on Twitter Total Shares423 Development News Article Contents 1 Introduction 2 Device testing notes 3 Results 3.1 Geekbench 3.2 GFXBench GL Benchmark 3.3 AnTuTu 3.4 3DMark 3.5 PCMark (v1.0) 3.6 Web benchmarks: Octane, Kraken, SunSpider 4 Conclusion Last week, I had the privilege of visiting Qualcomm's San Diego campus to check out the new Snapdragon 835 chip and run some benchmarks using Qualcomm's reference platform for the SoC. You'll never guess what happened next (you will: benchmarks). Full disclosure: Qualcomm paid for me to ride the train to San Diego, which was very pretty, put me up in a great hotel next to Qualcomm HQ for two nights, and took me out to a very nice dinner... with an open bar. There was a taco station with really, really good Mahi-Mahi. The guacamole was also totally solid. We played cornhole. I lost. Repeatedly. Introduction The Snapdragon 835 is the next major evolution of Qualcomm's system-on-a-chip platform, and it's a one you'll be seeing in a lot of smartphones this and probably next year. You can read about the big changes in our initial announcement post right here, but I'll provide a flyover for those of you wanting the short version. Basically every major chip on the 835 is a new part, from the X16 LTE modem, to the octa-core Kryo 280 CPU based partly on ARM reference cores, the Adreno 540 GPU, the Hexagon DSP, and more. The new 10nm fabrication process also brings inherent improvements across the board (literally), especially in efficiency, allowing Qualcomm to fit more transistors onto a smaller die than ever before. The Snapdragon 835 is, in fact, the first commercially-available 10nm SoC on earth. Initially, Qualcomm claimed the 835 would be around 20% faster than the 820, while also capable of being around 25% more power-efficient on the same workload. While the reference hardware we tested on is obviously quite... robust, the results from synthetic benchmarks indicate Qualcomm may have undersold the 835 a bit in some areas, perhaps in case things didn't go as well as they hoped. It's possible that real-world handset performance increases will be more in line with the 20% figure Qualcomm quotes, but with the GPU performance nearly increasing by 40% or more over the 820 in some tests, there's more to it than just CPU here. This is a very fast processor, even if it may not necessarily go toe-to-toe with the best from Apple in some ways (Apple's chips still unabashedly dominate in single-thread CPU performance, for example). The results from testing, and comparisons to production devices, follow. Device testing notes Qualcomm smartphone reference platform running Android 7.1.1 - Snapdragon 835 Google Pixel XL running Android 7.1.1 (release branch) - Snapdragon 821 OnePlus 3T running Android 7.0 (release branch) - Snapdragon 821 Galaxy S7 running Android 6.0.1 - Exynos 8890 Galaxy S7 edge running Android 7.0 - Snapdragon 820 Huawei P10 running Android 7.0 (preproduction) - Kirin 960 I realize the S7 Exynos and P10 I've thrown in here are not ideal because of their OS version in the case of the former and the preproduction status of the latter. Nonetheless, they are valuable points of comparison, and leaving them out would make this post much less helpful. Qualcomm's reference device, pictured here, does not contain any active cooling components (it doesn't have a fan) and, aside from being very thick because of its status as an engineering test platform, runs the same chip Qualcomm will sell to its partners. Qualcomm certainly could tune the device to know to run at peak speed when known benchmarks are detected, but they'd be far from the only company to do this. This is why benchmarks generally should be taken with a grain of salt. I'm not here to sell you these results: I'm just reporting what I observed, nothing less, nothing more. Results If you want to see the raw data for each test, I've placed them in this table (I know, it's not readable, but you can refer back to it after looking at the charts). Device GB4 (1) GB4 (multi) GFXB (Car) GFXB (Man3.1) GFXB (Man3.0) GFXB (T-Rex) Antutu 3DMark (Slingshot 3.1) 3DMark (Slingshot 3.0) 3DMark (Ice Storm) PCM 1.1 Octane Kraken SunSpider Snapdragon 835 2059 6461 1513 2668 3873 6625 181939 3803 4996 38518 8124 14301 2308 237.4 OnePlus 3T 1840 4032 1180 2058 3006 5279 157191 2619 3298 30741 FAILED 9280 2601 531 Pixel XL 1638 4089 1148 1997 2982 5131 137290 2839 3205 27376 5913 9154 2775 576 Galaxy S7 (Exynos) 1866 5358 904 1706 2485 4643 135691 2010 2362 29216 5064 10337 2565 511 Galaxy S7 edge (SD820) 1450 3800 587 1005 1584 2448 130357 2327 2916 18914 5613 4716 4038 651 Huawei P10 1926 5713 748 1403 1851 3690 119618 1910 2230 25066 7222 8947 3159 464 Geekbench First up is the well-known Geekbench suite, version 4. This test is a synthetic benchmark designed to measure raw CPU performance. The Snapdragon 835 fares better than all other devices tested, unsurprisingly, but it's in multithreaded performance where it particularly shines, obtaining a nearly 40% higher score in the multicore test versus the Snapdragon 821. While Huawei's P10 is within shouting distance, the 835 still pretty easily glides past it in this area. This is probably what happens when you double the number of CPU cores, to be fair. Single-core scores have the 835 just marginally faster than the 821, a little over 10% or so. So we're probably not going to see major single-thread performance improvements with the 835. GFXBench GL Benchmark GFXBench contains a variety of Open GL ES 3.1, 3.0, and 2.0 graphics benchmarks. The tests are listed in descending order based upon their complexity, starting with the newest benchmark which tests advanced GL ES 3.1 features. These are all "offscreen" tests, meaning all were rendered at the same resolution regardless of the device's actual, physical resolution. Here we see what is probably the single biggest across-the-board performance boost for Qualcomm's newest chipset, the Adreno 540 GPU. Results from the 835 easily bested the Snapdragon 821 in the most demanding test by around 30%, a lead that translated to pretty much every test in the GFXBench suite. That's impressive. As we can see, Samsung's Exynos and Huawei's Kirin still have a ways to go to catch up with Qualcomm on GPU performance. But Qualcomm seems quite invested in improving Adreno generationally. AnTuTu AnTuTu is a holistic benchmark that combines things like storage speed, RAM, GPU, CPU, and other performance into a single score. While it's not the most helpful in this sense (after all, who knows what kind of storage Qualcomm's reference platform utilizes), it's a very commonly-used benchmark and at least worth throwing up here. The 835 does well here, clocking in at over 181000, but AnTuTu really is the quintessential "my number is bigger than yours" benchmark, full of manipulated results and arbitrary weighting of the test factors. But hey, if you care - the 835 wins. 3DMark 3DMark is an immensely popular graphics benchmark utility on desktops, and the mobile version has picked up steam over the years as well. Our first test is the new OpenGL ES3.0/3.1 Slingshot Unlimited, which uses the same resolution to render the test across all devices at the same resolution. The results here are probably the most stark of almost any, with the Snapdragon 835 besting the 821s of the Pixel XL and OnePlus 3T by nearly 50% on the GL ES 3.0 version of the benchmark, and closer to 40% on the GL ES 3.1 variant. The Adreno 540, it seems, is no joke. We also ran the more commonly referenced Ice Storm Unlimited, which while not as pronounced in terms of the distance between first and second, still was pretty convincing. The 835 bested the next-closest phone, the OnePlus 3T, by a little under 30%. This test tends to bring CPU into the mix a fair bit more, so we also see the Exynos version of the Galaxy S7 faring pretty well, better than the Pixel XL. PCMark (v1.0) For a variety of reasons, we did not test version 2.0 of PCMark with the Qualcomm reference platform phone (it was largely unavailable during our testing, though some did manage to get results), so we're using the older version one platform. PCMark is another holistic benchmark that seeks to recreate "normal" device workloads and measure real-world performance, though it's hard to call any strictly standardized and largely synthetic test representative of "reality." Anyway, here's the chart. Unfortunately, this older version of PCMark would never successfully complete on the OnePlus 3T. The 835 comes out ahead here by a decent margin, but it's not a blowout - PCMark only awards the 835 a score around 10% higher than the Kirin 960 in the Huawei P10. Web benchmarks: Octane, Kraken, SunSpider Web benchmarks like Google Octane and SunSpider measure Javascript performance. Octane, I've found, can be a pretty reliable indicator of a given platform's browser performance, but I'd hardly call it an end-all-be-all. That said, the 835 reference platform demolished anything else. It was a full 40% faster than the next-closest Galaxy S7 Exynos variant, and over 50% faster in the test than either Snapdragon 821 phone I tested. Hopefully this means good things. Next up are SunSpider and Kraken, which measure how long it takes to complete a series of benchmark tests, so a lower score is better for these two, as opposed to higher for everything else in this post.   The 835 comes out on top (rather, bottom) in both tests, though it has a surprisingly strong advantage in the SunSpider test. I'm unsure what build of Chrome the reference phone was running (sorry, that's my bad), so I wonder if we could be seeing some kind of anomaly there. Conclusion Surprise: newer chip is faster than older chips! Sometimes a lot faster. Sometimes a little. I try not to take benchmarks too seriously, because they are definitively unreal experiences - there's very little they tell us that guarantees a particular user experience when a piece of hardware technology is implemented in a consumer product. Of course, we can draw some basic conclusions: the Snapdragon 835 probably isn't going to set the world on fire with its single-core performance, which seems just marginally better, though the switch from 4 cores last year to 8 this year will almost definitely benefit multithreaded workloads. The shrink to a 10nm process will make the chip more efficient while doing the same work when compared to a Snapdragon 821, as well. I think the Adreno 540 is also very considerably faster than the GPU in the 820-series Snapdragons, though Qualcomm was completely mum on how those gains were achieved. We don't even know if it has more core clusters - Qualcomm keeps Adreno under a pretty tight lock and key, so we'll have to wait for microscopic and x-ray analysis to really learn anything about that side of things, probably. All in all, though, I was glad to experience the benchmarking event, and I hope to have a post more about how everything went down for you later this week, as opposed to the cold, dry numbers in this article (which I know many of you want to see, regardless). We also went to Qualcomm's labs to check out things like power consumption, imaging, and virtual reality, so there are things we discussed that I haven't even brought up here. But if you're just in it for the bar graphs and tables, I hope you got something out of this post. This is my first real go at a benchmarking feature, and I realize my graph visuals aren't the best (this week has been insane [see: this little thing], otherwise I'd have given them proper attention for more consistency), so my apologies for that. But I wanted to be sure we got them out there for you. So, anyway, forgive a bit of sloppiness here and there, and thanks again to Qualcomm for having me.

A Person Soon enough these numbers will be a jump from something like 10,200 to 10,800 and the performance bump will go unnoticed. Gustavo Well, if you test on Geekbench 3(that was used back in the day), the numbers should be even higher than from these tests. With Geekbench 4 the numbers are lower. trwnh Psht, remember getting above 5 MFLOPS in Linpack? krazyfrog BenchmarkPi or GTFO Toss3 While those numbers are quite good the thing that matters most is sustained performance and latency when switching between clusters. This is why ARM's new DynamIQ is going to be quite revolutionary. freeper Looks like Exynos is better. That plus the 6 GB of RAM makes me wish that I could get the Chinese, Japanese or South Korean version of the Galaxy S8+. M3D1T8R Nice numbers. But what I'm really waiting to see is battery life info. The remarkable new 10nm process coupled with a large battery like 5 Ah could finally give us true flagship performance without sacrificing great battery life - something that currently requires going with a midrange (14nm) Snapdragon 625. Let's only hope that manufactures don't take the likely impressive efficiency improvements​ of the 835 and give it all away by including smaller batteries in the name of ever thinner devices. Give us Snapdragon 835 and 5 Ah, and we'll have my next flagship. Until then, 625 it is. 835 and a small 3Ah battery will likely perform decent for most casual users, but for great battery life I'll happily take something like a Zenfone 3 Zoom along with $400 left in my pocket. Muzaffar Having 835 SoC and yet we're using it just for WhatsApp, facebook, etc. I'm still using Note 4 exynos version, and still smooth even with 4 multiwindow at the same time. There are some noticeable lag on games (but mobile games are jokes anyway). So you are right, power optimization is much more desirable. Unless Microsoft ready to release Win10 ARM version, then it would be a different story. rafly sadly, Windows RT is a failed project because practically you got no customer software (all I know is some business related), and you can't use x86 software on it. Hopefully after SD835, we're now seeing a full Windows 10 on Tablet/Phone that can be docked crutchcorn Oh, you haven't heard the news? Microsoft got FULL Windows on Snapdragon 835 rafly I know. the reason why I typed hopefully, because I don't think that x86 software can work flawlessly on ARM CPU—not on release at least. crutchcorn https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaSmZzo3Y_c I dunno, this looks pretty smooth to me Mike Nope. Google Windows server on Qualcomm Snapdragon 835. There was a register article on it last week. tansuperman Correct. It's not full windows more like virtual. Muzaffar It's not native windows, but it's fully working. Same like when you play Mario on android phone. Jack Smith Win10? For a phone? Think Windows phone is dead. Muzaffar Have you seen full windows 10 running on SD 820? Jack Smith But without apps why does it matter? Muzaffar It's matter because you can actually run full ms office, adobe photoshop, even Steam and other x86 apps/program. I'm not talking about Win 10 mobile, i'm talking about full windows 10, the same windows 10 that run on your PC or laptop. Ezzy Photoshop on ARM. Good luck. Loved Wait.. What? 835SoC is enough for Facebook???? You're kidding me.. Right? charlie Jason That's precisely what manufacturers are gonna do. Make the phone thinner to "take advantage of" the better efficiency. marcusmarcus2 "Nice numbers. But what I'm really waiting to see is battery life info." Umm, won't that info also be numbers. /s All seriousness, I completely agree with you. john doe It's called replaceable battery ;) Nathan J It's pretty much a given that the SD835 beats other Snapdragon processors, though the Exynos comparison is a good metric, for those who can get that device. I'm curious to see how the SD835 stacks up to the Apple A10. They both smash all the previous Snapdragon processors, that's for sure, but hopefully the SD835 at least catches up to Apple, six months later. Because that was when Android was at its best. When the new iPhone would come out and smash all the Android flagships. Everyone was working so hard to compete then. Today the competition feels stale by comparison. Cakefish Nope, the Snapdragon 835 is nowhere near the power of the Apple A10. D13H4RD2L1V3 Am I the only who's kinda "meh" with the GB scores after experiencing the Kirin 960's CPU on the Mate 9? GPU is unsurprisingly beastly, though. Hoping that the new 10nm fabrication actually gives us some gains in efficiency, and not used as an excuse for a 2000mAh battery in a 5.7" device because its razor-thin.... Eumelanin Knight I'm actually more interested in what QC does with their midrange chips this year. Wouldn't mind an article like this for those. efc64 What details do you have on the test device itself David? Looks like a 5.5"-5.7" phablet, 1440p? What RAM? Any hints as to how much the device throttles? I realise that these are all subjective things but they play a part too in addition to raw benches Tech Writer It's a 5.5" phone with QHD resolution. Since it's a platform testing device, it's fairly thick to maintain cool thermals and not throttle. It has 6GB RAM. -From AnandTech. Ryan J Like others have said, I'm interested to see the affect on battery life and how quick it sucks one dry. Also, what about heat? It is definitely efficient at processing, but how often is it going to get throttled from overheating joseph carmine nero Nice article. Thanks but this emphasize on single core apple is bullshit Martins Nkem why? joseph carmine nero Because it's no longer as relevant as it used to be.Android can now use multicore in almost every app. it's like ignoring the total power of the SOC Kiko Eschobar UX performance is very much tied to single core performance.. Ever wondered why I phones don't stutter nearly as often? Proper UX compensation. Meanwhile, Android is still seeing cores thrown at the problem like dudes throw 20 dollar bills at strippers. I wouldn't be shocked if the iPhone 7 remained the performance king until 7s (8) comes out. joseph carmine nero I don't have any stutters on my Z5 so I find it completely BS.like when people said WP is totally smooth but mine had loading screens instead of lag Curt Hopefully the Pixel 2 will squeeze this in. matteventu Hopefully NO. Pixel will come at end-2017. This is a CPU of 1st/2nd quarter of 2017. I'm not saying it's a bad CPU, but just that they will do something like S820>S821. Not like they did with Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X, using CPUs available since the beginning of the year. I cross my fingers for a Snap836. Cakefish 2nd quarter. Galaxy S8 won't be out until April and it's the first phone with this SOC. charlie Jason SD821 is hardly different from SD820. SD836 will be a similar story if it does exist. What Google really needs to do is start launching their phones closer to April, when the latest SD chips become available, rather than selling flagships that have processors that will become last gen in six months. Duder12 It's better to compete next to the iPhone. You are backpedaling. Google needs to finish their own SOC. Not increase reliance on Qualcomm. Dubs816 Why would it be better to compete next to the iPhone? It would actually be better to get a head start on the iPhone than to go head-to-head with it. That is a battle the Pixel will lose every single time. charlie Jason It's unlikely that their own SoC will competed favorably against Qualcomm's SD flagship. Especially in the GPU department. Jack Smith No reason to do SOC. Instead things like the TPU makes far more sense. wicketr There was a premium for that 821 device. Personally, i wish they would have gone for the 820 and added wireless charging, waterproofing, and stereo speakers for the same price. Duder12 It was for VR and the camera DSP. Middlefinger Looks like Exynos 9 will be faster based on other data ive seen. This is pretty much always the case though in Exynos v Snapdragon hough. Gregory IMO, mobile CPUs have already gotten to the point where additional performance isn't beneficial. I mean, flagship smartphones have been running buttery-smooth for like 2 or 3 years, what else that CPU performance can be used for? An average user isn't going to do anything computationally heavy on this kind of device. Ammar "I mean, flagship smartphones have been running buttery-smooth for like 2 or 3 years" That's a joke, right? Gregory No. SGS6 is smooth, as is Nexus 6P, as is Google Pixel. Rod Nexus 5 was smooth since 2013. Marvin R. And everybody should stop to be innovative when some users feel always ok with the current status? Maybe you think everything is maxed out since years but if you look at complexity of apps (e.g. HDR photos, 4k videos) and competition (iPhone is leading most of the time with CPU power) then there is still room for improvement. And when looking at browsers a CPU cannot be too fast ;) Gregory Faster CPU allows for less optimized code, that's it with browsers basically. Current CPUs handle 4k video and HDR photos just fine. Why don't they already focus on batteries that don't suck? Good_Ole_Pinocchio They have to focus on ALL of it at the same time. Cakefish The first buttery smooth high end phone was the Pixel. Rod I disagree. The Nexus 5 was buttery since it's launch. chris pinkston I'll take all the extra they want to give but I agree. The average user doesn't need more . Look at how powerful the apple A10 is single core compared to sd820/821 yet the iPhone doesn't offer that much different of an experience compared to something like a pixel or OnePlus 3 in typical task. With more processing power though it gives software room to grow. Plus the added multi core power is nice for all we do on our devices at once sometimes. Lars Jeppesen As a mobile web application developer, I have do kindly disagree with you. Web apps/browsers need more GPU performance and raw javascript performance.. there's still some way to go before we have 100% smoothness level compared to native apps. But it's getting close with modern web techniques... Gregory As a native Android app developer, I also disagree with you. Web apps are DOA as a concept. Web technologies aren't suited to build real apps, and I doubt they will ever be. JS will always be slower compared to languages used to build native apps because of the amount of (unnecessary) freedom it gives like dynamic data types or the ability to add/remove fields in an object at runtime. Even if we would have an ideal JIT for both Java and JS, these things are going to severely limit the ways to optimize the runtime performance in JS. Lars Jeppesen Why does that matter if the cpu is fast enough? You're argumenting that Java is DOA because C is much faster, and Java will never be as fast as C. Native apps have their advantages, Web apps have other advantages over Native. They both have their place. Web technologies are perfectly suited to build real apps. I'm not sure if you're joking of just haven't followed much of the Web development for the past couple of years. Dominic81 I'm pretty sure the new Exynos will be superior, again YouNex Yes, unfortunately for us Rod Actually, the S835 just beated it on Geekbench. Dubs816 The Snapdragon 835 just beat the new Exynos on Geekbench in single and multi score? Please share. asrat_24 The new Exynos isn't out yet how could it beat it? He's confused 😕 Rod Sure. http://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Galaxy-S8-Plus-2.png Bojo Talerico Unless there is some unknown issue like overheating on the 810 Lars Jeppesen All podcasts I've been listening to lately say that it doesn't make any difference that the LG G6 comes with the 821 - that the user won't notice any difference and that the 821 is just as capable as the 835... I know most UX is single core, but still - I think we're gonna get all those bloggers to eat their words when the first 835 products hit the street... Ammar "I know most UX is single core" Which is why despite having 8 cores, Android performance is still lightyears behind iOS. Lars Jeppesen At least I get to choose which browser I want to use on Android. krazyfrog Are you not aware that you can install other browsers on iOS? Cheer Chunhao I think he meant he can set the default browser, which from what I last heard, is still not possible on iOS Lars Jeppesen Nope, I meant Apple doesn't allow 3rd party browsers on iOS. All "browsers" are essentially skins on Webkit (Safari's engine) Nuno Monteiro 2.5.6 Apps that browse the web must use the appropriate WebKit framework and WebKit Javascript. From the app store guidelines. All browsers on iOS are essentially a wrapper over the provided WebKit libs. A Safari with a different aesthetic, if you will. So, yeah, you can install browsers to your heart's content on iOS, but they will all be a repackaged Safari, I'm afraid. krazyfrog Didn't know people were so obsessed with the underlying engine of a browser to reduce everything else about it as just an aesthetic. Chrome alone feels wildly different from Safari due to its UI. And Firefox Focus is in a different league altogether. The user couldn't care less that the engine underneath are roughly identical because of their different user experiences, which is primarily what people download different browsers for. Lars Jeppesen Are you not aware that all browsers on iOS are just skins with Webkit as the engine? Apple does not allow 3rd party browsers on their platform. krazyfrog That is some hair-brained pedantry. Didn't know a browser had to have a different engine for it to qualify as a different browser. By that logic Chrome and Opera on desktop are also the same browser with different "skins". Lars Jeppesen Well I believe that there are aspects you are overlooking: 1. Yes, Chrome and Opera are using the same engine. This is a CHOICE made by Opera because they don't have the resources to develop their own. They also used Webkit before Google forked the Blink engine, because they got tired of how slow progress was made. The point being here, that Opera made a choice - and on all platforms except iOS you have CHOICES of other browsers with other browser engines. Apple, on the other hand, FORBIDS other browser engines, meaning that no browser vendor has a choice. Everybody is forced to use Apple's engine. 2. Why does Apple do this? Well, it effectively lets them control implementation of new browser features. This means there is no competition on it's platform (as Safari gets further preferential treatment on the OS level) and no new HTML standards can be implemented on the platform without Apple's approval. 3. Apple uses this to cripple and slow progress of web applications as much as possible, because better and more powerful web applications would become a threat to Apple's control via the native applications. 4. In recent years, Apple has become the "new Microsoft" in terms of being behind on new standards, trying to hold back the Web on it's platform. Revolutionary new technologies like Service Workers, offline Push, offline synchronization, and many many other new standards, cannot be implemented on the platform. 5. Apple demonstrates it's lack of commitment for the web by never ever attending conferences, gatherings, or other communities regarding web development. Something all other browser vendors do - and contribute to. They even work together to ensure new standards are implemented in a good way. Apple doesn't care (about it's customers) because it wants to keep control. I hope you can see that what I wrote was absolutely not pedantic, as it has profound consequences. TegTronix™ Certified Dealer Android performance is actually just as or better than iOS in some ways, and the same shit for iOS. But, comparing the two is like comparing a heavy weight OS like W10 and iOS would be Light running Linux. It just doesn't fare out in the end. I'd like to see a SD chip in an apple device and the A10 in an Android. It probably wouldn't score that well, the A10. chris pinkston Only it's not. Android has gotten really efficient in the past few versions. Ever used a Nexus or pixel? See how smooth and fluid pure Android is running in hardware that isn't as powerful as Apple's A10 chip.. Androids ui and animation smoothness rivaling ios.Performanve even being faster in some areas like opening system apps, light third party apps and web browsing at times. tiger Nor does iPhone kick apps out of memory...despite 2GB RAM. chris pinkston True but does it matter? There are Android phones that have great ram management as well, they have more ram usually but what does it matter when you don't pay anymore for it vs iPhone. tiger You are paying similar money for inferior engineering and design...and lack of future proofing hurts. Ammar "It will perform better in a single heavy workload app" Which is basically 99% of usage for most people. chris pinkston Average usage is light social media apps, web browsing , email and picture taking. High end androids open and execute these task just as fast as the iPhone and I some cases faster. You would have to get into something heavier like to see the single core processing power advantage of the A10. Tech Writer Most UX is not single core. Even simple apps like chrome can utilize all 8 cores rather well. And you are forgetting the background tasks, listeners and multi-window. Not to mention that multi-core processors are often much smoother due to less number of context switches. Lars Jeppesen Unless you ate using Webworkers, Javascript is single threaded Ammar Samsung will still find a way to make this lag like a bitch on their S8. Renan I don't know what you're talking about. My S5 shows no noticeable smoothness while running either TouchWiz or LineageOS. Both feels pretty solid for me. Dash Dillinger Are u running like 0 apps? Renan Nope. All my apps installed, including Facebook. Never had anything to complain about the performance. Randroid You could run Facebook on a phone with 7 of the best processor in the world, and it would still lag because the app is so terribly written. Lord Argyris Well, you're in luck, since I heard that Saygus will be coming out with just such a phone. Gustavo Yeah, but run it for like 6 months or more without wiping on TouchWiz. You will see it lags like shit TegTronix™ Certified Dealer My dad had a Galaxy S6 before switching to the Moto X, due to him disliking the TouchWiz UI, but, nonetheless he had it for about 8 months, and it ran "buttery smooth" I don't know what your phone's problem is, sir, but, you need to manage it. I'm still on a Nexus 6, and it's running like new. asrat_24 Sadly same experience my gf had her Samsung phone was initially great but after a couple months it lagged like hell. Not really sure what triggers it Jack Smith I can factory reset my s7e and still noticeably way more lag than my sons Pixel that never been reset. Touch lag. Justin Every Samsung phone I have used was very stuttery after like 2 months... Except for the s6 edge which used exynos. I am currently using the pixel and it's way smoother than any samsung. I wont buy another Samsung phone unless it's an exynos variant which they refuse to sell in the U.S. Jack Smith Same on buying Samsung. My s7e is first and last! Pixel 2 is my next phone. TegTronix™ Certified Dealer Then you, sir, don't know how to use an Android. If it's lagging, you need to delete some shit/stop some apps. And, also, it could just be the bloatware from certain carriers(I.e. T-Mobile or AT&T) The exynos variants are always much more stable because the chip was precisely made for that phone, AND why it isn't as good with SD is merely because the device was built to be used with Exynos. Atleast that's what I think. needa You don't have to close apps anymore. Haven't for quite some time. Bloatware doesn't really do a whole lot either nowadays, as background processes are much more efficient in Android, not to mention the power of the soc. And exynos most certainly is not made for the Galaxy. They are two separate divisions within Samsung. They actually bid and sell their chips to the mobile side. I run an extremely clean OnePlus One. And I still get lag from time to time. It is the nature of the beast. More so with Samsung, as they do a ton of their own stuff. Rod That mindset is exactly what kills Android. The user doesn't need to do anything. The system has to take care of itself. Ever heard of anyone having to kill apps on the iPhone? Mike Yes. Maybe many users just use iPhones for web and messaging, but I left iPhone for Android a few years back because iOS crashed just as much, but I could get a more powerful and configurable Android for less. DragoCubed It's in response to the "you dont know how to use android" part. so basically saying everyone needs to disable, delete and force stop apps, which you don't. Not Everyone tiger You do realize that iPhones maintain 60 fps in pretty much everything...from UI to high-demand gaming. Yielar1 I'll have to borrow my nieces iPhone sometime Rod It doesn't matter what the user does with his phone. iOS limits background usage, so you can rest assure your battery won't be eaten by some rogue app. TegTronix™ Certified Dealer I don't have to force stop apps since marshmallow I'm on 7.1.1 and my battery has been just swell. No lag in gaming either, such as Mobius FF, and Asphalt Xtreme But it's just that it annoys me when some are bitching about their battery and they have over 20 apps downloaded, all being social media which tend to be battery eaters. Rod The problem is not planned battery usage. It's rogue apps. I know that Whatsapp, Snapchat, Facebook, Telegram and whatnot will continously use power to ping the servers. But what I didn't count on, was Flynx eating 40% of my battery while the phone was in my pocket, because I had a website that auto-reloads loaded in it. Left me stranded for the rest of the afternoon. TegTronix™ Certified Dealer Funny, I mentioned that in a new comment. But yeah, I agree with that as well. Yielar1 Yes, coworker's are having to kill apps constantly to save battery. Rod Ridiculous. Cakefish Can you define 'lag' please? I see the same complaint posted around the internet everywhere, but I don't think I'm interpreting it the way the original posters intended. I can safely say that my Exynos Galaxy S7 does not lag much at all. The UFS storage means that apps launch quickly from a cold state and reload quickly from the multitasking view. It never seems to miss letters out in the keyboard. Loading websites is fast in the browser. So instances of genuine input lag are very few and far between. However, what it doesn't do very well is keep a consistent 60fps refresh rate when drawing UI animations, such as scrolling through menus and between screens as well as within apps etc. It skips frames a lot throughout the UI. This is what makes the Pixel and iPhones feel so smooth and fluid as they can maintain 60fps on a much more consistent basis throughout the UI. So I'd say my Galaxy S7 doesn't lag but definitely has trouble maintaining a solid 60fps refresh rate throughout the UI. chris pinkston Yes that is what most people see as "lag". I'd don't like it and that's why I left Samsung a long time ago. My Nexus 6p is so much smoother and consistent In It's ui, animations and such. Having stuttery UI, keyboards and such just makes the expensive device feel lacking even if it's fast. Cakefish I'm going to go for the Pixel 2 (or whatever Google call it) this year to replace my Galaxy S7. I'm going to skip the Galaxy S8 for that same reason, it just isn't capable of maintaining a smooth fluid UI most of the time. Again, that's not the same thing as input lag, I wish people would stop mixing the two up. Kelderic I was going to get a Pixel to replace my Galaxy S4, but first it was sold out, and then I had to pay for a car fix. And now, we're halfway to Pixel 2. Plan now is to do the same as you, wait until P2 comes out and get that. Yielar1 Pixel is mediocre at best compared to other flagships. What's with the huge bezels and lacking camera features? I'm a Google fan but they missed the mark on the og Pixel. Samsung isn't going to pull any punches this year on the S8 and Note 8. Probably why they anticipate a larger preorder than the popular S7. Going to be a great year for flagships especially if they increase battery mah..since thinner hasn't been a request for 5 years or more. tansuperman Sammy makes the very best hardware, but once again they will have horrible software and heat issues. Heat issues were not just from the note 7. Every Sammy phone has had it. bekifft Heat issues != spontaneous combustion. Kind of a different class of problem. Yielar1 No heat issues with my S7 Edge or my Note 7 I had to surrender. I did have issues with my Note 4 but things seem to be much improved with the Grace UI. bekifft Thinner hasn't been a request for a long time, yet for the last five years they always tout it like someone asked for it. At this point I feel they are all completely deaf to it. I guarantee you most phones with this processor will be thinner than anyone wanted and have smaller batteries than anyone asked for. I mean everyone loves a camera hump right?! Jack Smith Pixel camera is incredible. I am tired of Samsung lag personally and my #1 desired feature. But no heat issues with my S7e just lag, lag, lag. Impulse_Vigil Or we could accept input lag isn't the only kind of lag... You can call it frame skipping, stuttering, whatever, but it's just semantics in this context. Cakefish I suppose, but I believe that lumping any and every kind of performance issue all under the term 'lag' doesn't reflect on the true nature of the issue. I guess I just need to accept that the are differing definitions of the word. Impulse_Vigil If one wanted to be accurate, I agree, for me lag also recalls something slightly different (connection induced lag is the earliest exposure I remember to the word, much closer to input lag)... Fighting common online vernacular is like swimming upstream tho. Shoot, people didn't wanna know why/how even when absolutely all Android phones featured the same kind of graphical issues (and to a greater extent) while iOS had the most heavy handed animations to mask any slowdown. They shouldn't have to either tbh... Jack Smith Same for me. Gave my son a Pixel and i have a S7 Edge. Never again. The S7 lag drives me crazy. I know a 1st world problem. But when you use both back to back the Samsung lag is very noticeable! I am getting a Pixel 2 and would love to get on a wait list today. Justin Still trying to brag about Nexus 6P? The battery life is absolutely terrible. period. 2×4 big paragraph to say it can't maintain fluidity (60Hz refresh). yes, that's called lag it’s me tim-cock. That is not lag bra! Avieshek Rajkhowa Bra? Cakefish I was asking for their definition of 'lag' because different people have differing definitions of that word. Some people use 'lag' as a generic term to describe any kind of performance issue, but I don't. Rod https://www1-lw.xda-cdn.com/files/2016/08/SmartSelectGIF_2016-08-22-07-42-41.gif skitchbeatz The spikes you're seeing are a product of a poorly written app. Still funny though. krazyfrog This is from the S7/HTC 10 comparison. Same app worked fine on the HTC 10. Cheer Chunhao Then I guess android itself is poorly written then. I have seen a lot of spikes even just scrolling the system UI (notification shade and settings, for example). skitchbeatz ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Prithvi Boinpally So then why aren't those spikes on the Pixel, OP3T, or other close to stock phones? Cheer Chunhao I guess I should have mentioned that my statement is based on my experience with a Nexus 6, which is my daily driver. They are usually smooth, but there will just be occasion that its not, my point is, its not consistent. tansuperman Android is very poorly written. Always has been. Ammar You'll hardly see that kind of lag on a Pixel phone. It's a product of a poorly written and useless OEM skin. Major Sceptic They all lag at times mate , anyone that tells you different is full of it . MicroNix "They all lag at times mate , anyone that tells you different is full of it " So true. Nexus/Pixel owners will always say their sh*t don't lag but watch when a news item comes up saying Google released a fix for jank on a Nexus and suddenly, and just for that news story only, they all crawl out of the woodwork and start talking about their horror stories of having to reboot their Nexus devices sometimes daily or they slow down to a crawl. I had my Exynos S7 Edge go 58 days without a reboot and no lag whatsoever. Major Sceptic Indeed my friend , I also have a 6p and while it's not a bad device , it certainly has its share of slow downs , certainly over the years phones have improved considerably , pixels , I phones it doesn't matter non are perfect despite some claims they are. Senrab Nala Woopy do that's not long. Ive had my note 5 since they came out and it's been shit after about 8 months now it's none stop problems. Jack Smith Actually not the Pixel. Samsung also gets worse over time. Major Sceptic I remember a fellow doing a review saying that very thing , one second later the device had a major lag , then after a cut in the film and an edit it was back to lag free pixel viewing , I so laughed my head off , anyway as for the Galaxy phones mine have actually gotten better as time went on , and they did not suffer from Bluetooth issues, wifi issues , scratchy speaker , scratchy glass back, flare problems in the camera , microphone problems . But If you're happy with yours mate , that's great , I hope it stays that way for you . For me though I just think there are better devices out there that are not over inflated prices . Cakefish I look forward to getting either a Pixel or an iPhone later this year. Preferably a Pixel if Google can deliver a worthy 2017 phone. Jack Smith That is the big question. Can Google ramp up and fill Pixel 2 demand? There is already a lot of buzz so they need to make a lot. Plus more carriers in the US. I buy unlocked phones but many is the US do not. Cakefish I don't care about what Google do with carriers as I too plan to buy unlocked. Rod So why didn't the other ones lag? Senrab Nala I got Pixel and it lags aswel. Rod Contrary to what everyone says.. Rod On rare occasions, I believe. Cakefish I believe what those bars are representing are dropped frames, am i right? I've just tried it myself, I'm not seeing as many bars as in the screenshot above. Is that screenshot of the Snapdragon S7 by any chance? I'm also using Gboard if that makes any difference. Still, I never claimed that the phone could consistently maintain 60fps without any dropped frames. In fact, I claimed the opposite! Rod The bars represent how long it took to draw a frame. The green horizontal bar represents 16ms. For the UI to achieve 60FPS, all the vertical bars must be equal or shorter than the horizontal line. makapav How does one enable that view? Rod Developer settings > GPU profiling Joey Sfb How does GPU profiling related to Android OS being poorly written? It just a indicator for the device GPU draw speed vs its current rendering load. The rendering load could come from the Android processes, OEM customisation, App processes etc... Till someone set a reference point its not an effective measurement to compare even between two devices. Rod Use a Pixel and a Samsung with GPU profiling enabled, and you'll see the difference. Ammar Lag means slowness in launching apps and general stuttering and hiccups in animations or scrolling. If your S7 does that, which you say it does, then it lags. Cakefish No I don't get any delay in launching apps. Just occasionally stuttery animations and a lack of consistent 60fps scrolling. Ammar You don't see a delay because you're not comparing it with anything. Put it alongside an iPhone 7 and see. Cory S My definition is when I take it out of my pocket, and the lock screen chops away slowly over 15 seconds, and then I click on an app and have to wait another 5-6 for it to load, or when the keyboard is 3-4 letters behind me when typing. Cakefish My S7 certainly doesn't suffer from that, thankfully. Jack Smith Also have a S7 Edge and until replacing the Samsung software like touchwiz with Google had lag. Was a pain. Most frustrating was it wanting me to create a Samsung account but finally ended it nagging me. Suresh Aryal This "Samsung lags" BS has to stop. Every phone lags period. By the way my Exynos S7 on Nougat is faster than anything I have ever seen including my friend's Nexus 6P and OP 3T, memory management is top-notch (in fact better than Pixels), has great battery saving features (I could put it on max power saving mode and make it run for a couple of days). The only bad thing about this phone is slow updates and average speaker. Rod BS? https://www.xda-developers.com/with-the-note-7-samsung-still-delivers-embarrassing-real-world-performance/ charlie Jason These Samsung defenders need to start accepting the fact that Samsung stutters even when using fast processors. OnePlus and Pixel are simply way smoother. Bob Marley iPhone is smoother than OnePlus/Pixel too. charlie Jason That is true. Paul Hansen The Note 7 was actually usable unfortunately we couldn't actually own one Yielar1 Loved my N7 Paul Hansen Me too... Still have it in a drawer Jack Smith Did the Note lag as bad as the S7e? Or was it like the Pixel? Talking touch lag. Paul Hansen somewhere in between Yielar1 If you want an ugly phone and subpar screen and camera Rod This Jack Smith Totally agree. Use a Samsung and Pixel back to back and you will never appologize for Samsung again. dazed1 When you use the gpu rending script, it makes the lags! they do NOT exsist otherwise, i have tested this many times. Rod What script? It's a system's native tool. dazed1 The native tool itself makes the lags. Justin Galaxy S7 speaker is good enough, it's only softer by a little bit compared to Galaxy S6. I owned a Nexus 6P and the battery life is rubbish. Ammar "By the way my Exynos S7 on Nougat is faster than anything I have ever seen including my friend's Nexus 6P and OP 3T, memory management is top-notch (in fact better than Pixels)," LOL. Suresh Aryal LOL? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w-HYw-y0BI Watch this. tansuperman That's very believable. Lol Jack Smith This is NOT true. I have a s7e and gave son a Pixel. Ever since my s7e drives me crazy! Use both back to back and tell me there is no a diffrence. Btw, i have factory reset the s7e multiple times! Once you feel the diffrence it changes everything. I am talking touch lag. Jack Smith Replace the Samsung software like Touchwiz with Google and solves lag. Player Slayer Maybe the 835 will finally be able to run The Trail on something higher than low graphical settings! -Pixel XL user Marvin R. I know this is Android Police. But why not putting the latest iPhone also in the charts just for comparison (Apple is one of the best mobile CPU semiconductor)? chris pinkston They don't manufacture anything. They design now but don't manufacture. MJ Why? It would be irrelevant as the Ax series chipset doesn't run Android. Marvin R. But many of the benchmarks do run on iOS. I also don't care much of iOS but I'm interested in the technical standpoint and how far mobile CPUs have developed (I also don't like to ignore one of the biggest competitor). Apple mobile CPUs have often the highest benchmarks and Qualcomm is playing catchup game with them (this is the usual cycle in mobile CPUs for years). crutchcorn Hint: Apple murders everything else MJ I wasn't saying the benchmarks don't run on iOS. I said it's irrelevant... The Apple chip can be 50x faster but as I have no interest in the platform so it's irrelevant. chris pinkston True but when people see what's possible they want that in their device of choice. I prefer Android and would like a chip just as powerful as the A10 available for an Android phone. That said, I'm ok with the snapdragons because software for the most part doesn't exceed the capabilities of any of these flagship chips. Plus snapdragon 835 will only be inferior in single core cpu performance. Multi core cpu, GPU, wireless connectivity and features will be better on snapdragon Cheer Chunhao Yeah, it's pretty pathetic to see the difference between the single core performance of iPhone 7 vs even the 835. Winston Battery is the one I'm looking out for Rod Moto Z Play Winston Im tempted by the battery. But I've tried it and the camera AF is still utter garbage. Used a Moto X 14 and learnt how bad a camera could possibly be now. Its a shame too. The standard Z camera didnt have the same issue in my testing. Rod Yeah. I hope it's sucessor will keep it's battery life and improve on the rest. Winston If the Z2 Play gets the Pixel camera and same battery, plus a better FP sensor design, its my next phone. Rod I doubt it'll have a camera as good as Pixel's. It's a mid-range phone. The best camera will be on the Z. Cakefish In terms of CPU performance it's not a significant jump from the Exynos 8890. The focus appears to be mostly on energy efficiency rather than just raw CPU performance with this SOC. Cesar Cardoso For the use cases Qualcomm is apparently targeting the 835 (Samsung DeX, Windows 10), the SoC...er...platform looks promising, with enough firepower and a good hope of a great battery life (all hail 10nm). Let's see how it plays in the hands of the OEMs. Badelhas The most important thing at the moment is battery life. It sucks having to charge our phones during the afternoon or we wont make it through the day. Why do we only have 5000mAh batteries on cheap or mid range phones from some Chinese brands? Why cant we have a super high-end smartphone with a decent battery? I don't get it... needa Weight. Derik Taylor They could probably do that, but don't complain if the cost of the phone comes close to $1000. Max Johnson It'll also be huge with big bezels and no headphone jack. Rod Get a Moto Z Play Raj Will speak to my colleagues at HTC and see what we can do. charlie Jason My guess is that a huge battery only pleases the power users. But extra thickness and weight will turn off the average consumers. Alexis Urena I think the fact that its paired with the x16 modem is way more interesting than the fact that's its slightly faster than the already decent 821. needa TBH all I really care about are the browser benches. It is nice to see Qualcomm catching up to Apple in the aspect. 90% of my mobile usage is Chrome and Assistant. tiger Not in Google's own Octane benchmark.... Rash For argument, faster processor makes better response on phone. But often software underneath and real-life usage may not show much differentiation in user experience when comparing Snapdragon 821 vs 835 in phones. It definitely good for marketing touting benchmarks and possibly show some improvement in hardcore games. But, for most users, it ain't make any difference in daily usage and most even don't know what processor the phone is running on. So, look at your real needs and upgrade accordingly and SAVE money to spend on better things.

Rod It can. https://www1-lw.xda-cdn.com/files/2016/08/SmartSelectGIF_2016-08-22-07-42-41.gif https://www.xda-developers.com/with-the-note-7-samsung-still-delivers-embarrassing-real-world-performance/ reggjoo That's not lag, you have a hardware, or software conflict. Either something is going bad with the hardware, or some software isn't right. I had that happen to me, when I had a LG G3, it started doing that, and when I would plug it up to a pc, that was off, for some reason it would start the pc, or attempt to. In the end, it got the demigod error, and eventually would buzz very loudly, through the speaker, and freeze, then go back to the demigod error. Hope your phone's not going thru a death spiral. Rod That's lag. The UI is taking too long to render the frames. reggjoo Ok, you win, that's why the author of this article should do a article on this. Cakefish I find the problem with the term is that it's too vague. It could mean a time delay between touching the screen and seeing a response (my own personal definition of smartphone lag) or it could mean stuttery animations across the UI or it could mean a general inability to maintain 60fps update schedule when drawing elements of the UI, such as when scrolling etc. Leonardo Baez If anything... i'm impressed by the Huawei first attempt on soc performance. br_hermon "Newer chip is faster than older chips!" So then the REAL news here is just how flippin awesome of a job OnePlus did with the 3T. *Slow Clap* Roberto Virga I'm sorry, I cannot trust anyone who has tasted Qualcomm's Mahi-Mahi. From what I've been told, it's irresistible, and it causes reporters to lose all their objectivity. Why this press event? In a few weeks, Samsung will announce the S8, and we will have the chance to test the 835 performance on our own. We've witnessed in the past OEMs cheating by disabling throttling in benchmarks, so these numbers coming from Qualcomm don't mean much to me. TegTronix™ Certified Dealer I'm surprised Google hasn't bothered removing all those rogue apps that crash alot, don't work at all, or lie. They give Android a bad name. That's one of the core reasons iOS users won't move to Android, due to application stability. I don't see how someone is intrigued by Apple's design, tbh. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'm holding out for the SD975 it's supposed to be 5839274 better Marcelove "Qualcomm certainly could tune the device to know to run at peak speed when known benchmarks are detected, but they'd be far from the only company to do this." What makes every company doing this untrustworthy and the whole article pointless ( aside with benchmark values "per se")... Real tests? Those where we check browsers loading webpages, many apps being launched one after other and total time wasted, fps of games, etc... meyerweb And yet the S8 with the Exynos SoC appears to still be faster than with the 835. Why is Qualcomm always a half step behind? Cakefish I'd guess that it could be because Qualcomm dedicate more resources to the GPU instead of the CPU. It's well known that Qualcomm GPUs are the fastest in the Android phone world. Every SOC has a thermal and power budget and I'd guess that these limits are very similar between Snapdragon and Exynos, as both are and have been manufactured on the same process node in the past and present. So, if the GPU takes up more of that budget, it leaves less room for the CPU to stretch its legs, so to speak. Billy William W. Phillips Cornhole? Kind of a little too much info bud...:) modeless > Single-core scores have the 835 just marginally faster than the 821, a little over 10% or so. So we're probably not going to see major single-thread performance improvements with the 835. So disappointing! Single-core performance is where Apple is absolutely spanking Qualcomm (note they didn't let you benchmark against A10) and they're not doing anything about it. Single-core performance matters a lot more than the number of cores, and the entire Android ecosystem is suffering because of it. Anzhel Bozhinov AnandTech proved that Android works perfectly with HMP: http://www.anandtech.com/show/9518/the-mobile-cpu-corecount-debate/18 Shamoy Rahman This year isn't a crazy rush, it isn't a need for speed, instead Qualcomm is focusing big time on significantly cutting power consumption and heat buildup, something consumers have been demanding more than speed. Of course performance isn't going to stay stagnant, there will be a slight boost for the clock speeds for an ~20% speed improvement over the 821 and possibly 10% more transistors but the graphics are a lot more powerful more powerful and power efficient. Games running on the same settings on both the 820 and 835 will see significant differences in power consumption, heat buildup, and ultimately performance. The flaw with the Snapdragon 820/821 was that while it doesn't overheat like the 810, it gets fairly warm and after 15-30 mins of using a phone with an 820/821, you can see some small thermal throttling and slight performance dips, though its not a major issue. After 1 hour you might experience more thermal throttling on an 820/821 but this issue has been brought to the light and Qualcomm has finally brought us something we've been asking a while for. Heat buildup will be almost 50-70% less than that of the 820 which would result in much more consistent performance from long use and standby. So Qualcomm has really made the Snapdragon 835 perform a lot better than the 820/821 not by increasing IPC (clock speed, # of transistors) but by reducing heat buildup which eliminates the need for such frequently thermal throttling and performance inconsistencies. This is also thanks to 10nm LPE (which is not true 10nm, its just Samsung's mixed version of 10nm with a 14nm/20nm BOEL, basically its like partial 10nm). Though the Kryo 280 is a semi custom core based on the A73 and may not be based the Kryo, to me the 835 is just a Snapdragon 821 with slightly improved speed but the beauty lies in huge battery life improvements and much more consistent performance. This year I'm actually a lot more excited for Snapragon chips and I think they'll be able to give Exynos a much better fight. The gap between Snapdragon and Exynos is shrinking and maybe this year or within the next 2 years, their differences in speed may become insignificant. The gap between the 820 and 8890 was smaller than that between the 810 and 7420. Phones like the Sony Xperia XZ, Google Pixel and OnePlus 3T have shown excellent performance on the 820/821 all simply from software tweaks. So software is evolving too, this year we could see phones with Snapdragon 835 giving us a solid 12 hours off a single charge on medium/heavy usage and 30-40% less time to open apps. These benchmark numbers look very promising but there's nothing to conclude from that until we see real world performance in effect but I have no doubt that things are getting a lot better this year. james fuston That sunspider score is very encouraging. Brett Schulte Nice disclosure, wish more people did that. Thought I wouldn't have said you got corn-holed by Qualcomm if I were you.

(AAPL) Stock Owner Should Worry About AAPL stock is backed by a mountain of cash and some of the world's greatest tech minds, but it's not without risk Mar 31, 2017, 9:03 am EDT  |  By Vince Martin, InvestorPlace Contributor Get AAPL alerts: Submit Source: Shutterstock     View All   There’s a lot to like about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) at the moment. Since the beginning of 2017, AAPL stock has gained a whopping 25%, adding a cool $150 billion in value in less than three months. Along the way, it has repeatedly set all-time highs. Investors are looking to the launch of the next iPhone, likely in September, as the beginning of a new growth cycle for Apple. Corporate tax reform — most notably a tax holiday — could allow Apple to repatriate cash held overseas. And the Galaxy Note 7 troubles at rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) have strengthened Apple’s competitive position. However, investors have (whether they know it or not) reasons for relative concern when it comes to shares, particularly from a long-term perspective. Even AAPL stock bulls should understand — and be on the lookout for — these four risks to their positions: #1: iPhone or Bust I’d argue that the iPhone is the most successful consumer product of all-time. Only the Model T from the Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is in the discussion. It’s the iPhone that has taken Apple from the brink of bankruptcy 20 years ago to the world’s most valuable company. But the iPhone’s unparalleled success also makes the rest of Apple’s portfolio pale by comparison. And when Apple stock has struggled, it often has been because of worries about whether the rest of the business can support any growth. The iPad was a huge hit early on — but sales are declining. Apple Watch would have been a major success for pretty much any other company. But it barely moves the needle when it comes to sales and earnings. AAPL has struggled to find a consistent growth driver beyond the iPhone. Non-iPhone revenues have been almost bizarrely stagnant for the last five fiscal years: 2012: $77.8 billion 2013: $79.6 billion 2014: $80.6 billion 2015: $78.7 billion 2016: $78.9 billion The Mac laptop and desktop business has been relatively consistent. But the iPod has faded away, due largely to iPhone innovations. iPad sales are in steady decline. Services like iTunes and Apple Pay have picked up some of the slack, but not enough to grow non-iPhone sales. That leaves Apple (and AAPL stock) extremely dependent on the iPhone. In the long run, that could become an issue. The iPhone “Moat” Apple investors kept a close eye on Samsung’s launch of the Galaxy S8 this week. The Note 7 problems and the recent arrest of its vice chairman have no doubt hurt Samsung’s competitiveness. As one analyst pointed out on Wednesday, any errors with the Galaxy S8 launch could leave the Korean conglomerate permanently behind Apple. The long-term concern is that Samsung won’t be the only competitor. Low-cost Chinese competitors, such as Huawei Technologies, have their eye on the global smartphone industry. And as cameras and processors improve and become cheaper, over time, Apple’s edge seems likely to narrow. Just as HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) and Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DVMT) saw their dominance — and pricing power — fade in PCs, Apple will face the commoditization problem … someday.

View All Posts U.S. stock futures are headed lower this morning, as Wall Street prepares for the end of both March and the first quarter. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on pace for a roughly 5% gain for the quarter — its sixth consecutive positive quarter. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite is up nearly 10% on the quarter, with the S&P 500 Index adding about 5.8%. However, this morning isn’t’ looking anywhere near as bright, with Dow futures off 0.06%, S&P 500 futures down 0.12% and Nasdaq-100 futures lower by 0.04%. On the options front, things remained rather tame on Thursday, with about 13.7 million calls and 11.2 million puts crossing the tape. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio bounced back from Wednesday’s one-month low to finish at 0.58. The 10-day moving average, meanwhile, held at 0.64. Driving Thursday’s options volume, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) is making a comeback as Trump trade fears wane and Merrill goes through restructuring. Elsewhere, Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) was hammered following a poor fourth-quarter earnings showing, and Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX) is back in the bulls crosshairs after ending a strike at its Peruvian mine and nearing an export deal with Indonesia. Bank of America Corp. (BAC) Is the Trump trade in the banking sector back on? BAC stock traders seem to think so. The shares rebounded more than 2% yesterday, with sentiment bolstered by positive restructuring at Merrill Lynch designed to streamline the unit’s integration with BofA. Traders are hopeful that, despite the failure to repeal Obamacare, Donald Trump’s agenda of lower taxes, less Wall Street regulation and economic stimulus remain achievable goals. On that front, BAC stock options traders piled into the shares on Thursday, sending more than 1.02 million contracts across the tape. Calls made up roughly 75% of the day’s take. Looking at data from Trade-Alert.com, we find that Thursday’s biggest block trade was centered on the April $26 call, with a block of 28,700 contracts trading at the ask price of 3 cents, or $3 per contract. However, BAC stock would need to rally more than 9% for the April $26 call to trade in the money — that’s quite a bullish bet.

Print comment Reuse article Share: share on twitter share on facebook send by e-mail more... Mar 24, 2017 - 11:53 Visitors to the Baselworld watch fair, which runs through March 30, take in the latest models( KEYSTONE / GEORGIOS KEFALAS) With his shaved head, black shirt and relentless optimism, Jean-Claude Biver looks as if he might own a US west coast tech start-up. In fact, Mr Biver is at the forefront of the Swiss watch industry's reaction to tech-enabled smart watches, which industry executives believe is no longer the sort of existential threat once feared.  This week, Mr Biver, president of Tag Heuer and LVMH's wider luxury watch division, passionately defended traditional watchmaking at Baselworld, the 100-year-old exhibition for Swiss timepiece manufacturers on Switzerland's border with France and Germany.  "I don't want to criticise these people," Mr Biver says of his consumer electronics rivals. "I suppose that they sell just technology, and that is not enough, because on the wrist, people want emotions, people want dreams."  Swiss watchmaking remains locked in a steep downturn. Exports fell almost 10 per cent last year - largely the result of a spluttering global economy, overstocking in Hong Kong and a crackdown on the "gifting" of luxury watches in China. But, crucially for the industry, the fall in sales is not being blamed on the sort of structural shift in the market towards smartwatches that some analysts had predicted. In fact, makers of such wearables are now nervously looking at their own sales in a market for connected devices that has not take off as quickly as forecast.  This year's Baselworld strengthened the conviction among Swiss watch makers that consumer electronics rivals are not their biggest threat - and may even help a turnround in demand for finely crafted mechanical timepieces.  When first launched, the Apple Watch divided observers in the Swiss industry, which accounts for 95 per cent of watches retailing at more than SFr1,000.  "Three years ago, Apple didn't have to pay for a stand [at Baselworld] and they were the talk of the town," recalls Benjamin Berghaus, luxury industry specialist at the University of St Gallen.  The worst-case scenario was that US or Asian-designed electronic fashion and fitness icons would threaten a similar near-death experience for Swiss manufacturers as the arrival of Japanese quartz watches in the 1970s.  That has not happened. Sales of smart watches stalled last year - units shipped fell by 51.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2016 compared with the same period a year earlier, according to IDC market intelligence. Wearables pioneers such as Fitbit and Jawbone have struggled.  Smart watches were "quite interesting for people who do sport," says François Thiébaud, president of Tissot.  But wristwatches are emotional products.

Swiss watchmakers play long game as smartwatch sales slow
Ralph Atkins in Basel, Financial Times
Mar 24, 2017 - 11:53

With his shaved head, black shirt and relentless optimism, Jean-Claude Biver looks as if he might own a US west coast tech start-up. In fact, Mr Biver is at the forefront of the Swiss watch industry's reaction to tech-enabled smart watches, which industry executives believe is no longer the sort of existential threat once feared. 

This week, Mr Biver, president of Tag Heuer and LVMH's wider luxury watch division, passionately defended traditional watchmaking at Baselworld, the 100-year-old exhibition for Swiss timepiece manufacturers on Switzerland's border with France and Germany. 

"I don't want to criticise these people," Mr Biver says of his consumer electronics rivals. "I suppose that they sell just technology, and that is not enough, because on the wrist, people want emotions, people want dreams." 




Swiss watchmaking remains locked in a steep downturn. Exports fell almost 10 per cent last year - largely the result of a spluttering global economy, overstocking in Hong Kong and a crackdown on the "gifting" of luxury watches in China.

But, crucially for the industry, the fall in sales is not being blamed on the sort of structural shift in the market towards smartwatches that some analysts had predicted. In fact, makers of such wearables are now nervously looking at their own sales in a market for connected devices that has not take off as quickly as forecast. 

This year's Baselworld strengthened the conviction among Swiss watch makers that consumer electronics rivals are not their biggest threat - and may even help a turnround in demand for finely crafted mechanical timepieces. 

When first launched, the Apple Watch divided observers in the Swiss industry, which accounts for 95 per cent of watches retailing at more than SFr1,000. 

"Three years ago, Apple didn't have to pay for a stand [at Baselworld] and they were the talk of the town," recalls Benjamin Berghaus, luxury industry specialist at the University of St Gallen. 

The worst-case scenario was that US or Asian-designed electronic fashion and fitness icons would threaten a similar near-death experience for Swiss manufacturers as the arrival of Japanese quartz watches in the 1970s. 

That has not happened. Sales of smart watches stalled last year - units shipped fell by 51.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2016 compared with the same period a year earlier, according to IDC market intelligence. Wearables pioneers such as Fitbit and Jawbone have struggled. 

Smart watches were "quite interesting for people who do sport," says François Thiébaud, president of Tissot. 

But wristwatches are emotional products. "The first watch you ever received, you never forget. You don't usually keep the first smart watch you get," says Mr Thiébaud. 

"Why would you put a computer on your body?" asks Mr Biver. 

Nick Hayek, chief executive of the Swatch Group, told journalists last week that compared with Swiss watches meant to last generations, some new products had "life cycles of just six or 12 months, and then the supplier has to write off their investment". 

But watchmakers are still mindful of the need to bring elements of this market into their own ranges, with executives pointing to the lower price bracket in particular being fought over by younger, sportier Swiss bands. 

Tag Heuer launched a connected watch ahead of Baselworld. Meanwhile, Swatch, the company behind brands such as Omega and Tissot as well as the eponymous mass market watches, revealed last week it was developing an operating system to rival Apple's iOS and Google's Android. This would enable its own "eco system" of miniaturised products.

Mr Hayek also insists that Swatch's connected devices "must stay a watch. We don't want to be part of the consumer electronics industry."

Earlier this month, the tech giant released a few ads focusing on the Apple Pencil combined with the iPad Pro as a revolutionary new way of taking notes. Besides that, the ad also showed how easy and convenient it is to own an iPad Pro, which can be used to replace scanners, pads of paper and even laptops. And now, the three latest ads released by the company focus on showcasing exactly how an iPad Pro is better than a laptop. Why Is an iPad Pro Better than a Laptop? The question of everyone’s lips naturally will be: exactly how is an iPad Pro better than a laptop? The three videos venture to answer it by using Tweets to illustrate various customer opinions. For instance, the first video shows a Tweet of a user complaining about the weight of their laptop, and the solution naturally would be to get an iPad Pro, which can do all the same things as a laptop and even more, and still be light as a feather. The second video follows the concept of how to optimize your school work on your iPad, and it’s called “All your school stuff” (quite the fitting name, actually). The video displays a tweet of a student complaining about not being able to do their schoolwork adequately in their dorm room. Apple thus comes to the rescue through the versatile iPad Pro, which can be used to write assignments, do projects, and hold any sort of textbook or notebook. The moral of the story is is that, with an iPad, you can study anywhere. The third and final video caters to a very common issue most laptop users encounter and constantly complain about, namely batter life. This time, the tweet features a user that had the unfortunate experience of their laptop battery dying mid-flight, leaving them stranded on an island of boredom. However, according to the ad, an iPad’s battery can last an entire day, so there’s no risk of it running out in the middle of any activity.

The LG G6 and Samsung Galaxy S8 are both rocking big displays with an aspect ratio larger than the 16:9 you're used to on your phones, television and desktop displays. These phones have some of the widest aspect ratios ever seen on a mobile device. Is this the future of our smartphones or just another fad (like modular handsets)? We'll guide you through the ins and outs of aspect ratios and explain why the 18:9 display is one to watch out for in the future. What aspect ratio is, and why you should care The 3:2 Samsung Galaxy Tab S3. (Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo) Aspect ratio is the relationship between the height and width of a rectangular display. Your laptop has one, your tablet has one, and your smartphone has one — it's a measurement of how tall or wide a screen is. You'll usually see it expressed as a ratio, like the 4:3 ratio on older TVs, or the widescreen 16:9 ratio on new ones. It's also sometimes written as a decimal with the larger figure divided by the smaller (4:3 is 1.33 and 16:9 is 1.78). It doesn't tell you how big a screen is, just the proportional relationship between the height and the width, so on a 16:9 screen there will always be 16 pixels in one direction for every 9 pixels in the other. Of course this makes a pretty big difference to your user experience, as you'll know if you've ever tried to watch a widescreen movie on an ancient TV and seen the screen get swallowed up by huge black bars at the top and bottom. The 18:9 LG G6. (Image: Michael Nunez/Gizmodo) For just about any gadget, from a television to a smartphone, its aspect ratio is driven by what's being shown on it: for most hardware that's video content, which is why widescreen displays have become the standard. But for many tablets and laptops, apps and web browsing also need to be considered. In portrait mode you're talking about a display that's taller than ever, and in landscape mode you're going even wider than widescreen. LG and Samsung have fired the starting gun and it's going to be an interesting year for anyone who likes to keep an eye on smartphones or aspect ratios (or both). If some kind of substantial shift does happen - if the 18:9 display in the G6 or the 18.5:9 display in the Galaxy S8 become defacto, than OS makers and app developers are going to have to make adjustments. A brief history of smartphone aspect ratio Image: Brian Barrett/Gizmodo The launch of the first iPhone is a good a starting point as any when it comes to charting smartphone history, and that particular device arrived with a screen resolution of just 480 x 320 pixels — that's an aspect ratio of 3:2, which you'd be hard pushed to find on a phone today, but which is now showing up on 2-in-1s like the Samsung Chromebook Pro and the Surface Pro 4 from Microsoft. Even as Apple upped the resolution of the iPhone, the aspect ratio stayed the same, until the iPhone 5 in 2012, which featured a 1,136 x 640 pixel, 16:9 screen for all your widescreen movie and gaming needs. Both the latest models have more pixels but that same 16:9 aspect ratio. Outside of Apple, the trajectory is less easy to track, but it follows a similar pattern. You might not be surprised to hear that Samsung went 16:9 the same year Apple did, with the Galaxy S III (back in the days when they used Roman numerals). Meanwhile the Nexus line switched to widescreen in 2011 with the Samsung-made Galaxy Nexus, after the first two models opted for an older 1.66:1 standard. The first 16:9 Samsung phone. (Image: Brent Rose/Gizmodo) There have been too many phones launched since 2007 to mention them all individually, but the broad trend has been towards widescreen, 16:9 aspect ratios since the turn of the decade, first at 1,920 x 1,080 pixels (Full HD) and then at 2,560 x 1,440 pixels (Quad HD). At least part of the reason for that has been video: while TV and cinema have used widescreen formats for decades, it was only really at the turn of the 2010s that we started watching this kind of content on our phones (YouTube went widescreen in 2009), and so 16:9 makes sense to keep those letterboxing effects to a minimum. The next logical step would be to follow TV sets into the realm of 4K — and the same 16:9 aspect ratio — but that's not necessarily a given. Cinema and television formats could be on the verge of another serious shift, and that in turn might mean that 18:9 is going to be the future of our smartphones. The LG G6 and super-tall phones Image: Michael Nunez/Gizmodo LG kicked off 2017 with the launch of its unusually tall, 18:9 aspect ratio LG G6, running at a resolution of 2,880 x 1,440 pixels, and the Samsung Galaxy S8 was announced this week offering a slightly larger 18:5 2960 x 1440 display. Besides bezels almost completely disappearing, what's going on? Part of the thinking, as LG has openly explained, is to do with the proposed Univisium 2:1 format put forward by Italian cinematographer Vittorio Storaro. It's not been broadly accepted as yet, but it's designed to find a happy compromise between the competing widescreen aspect ratios of television (typically 16:9) and movie theatres (typically a wider 2.20:1). It was first suggested in 1998, but Univisium is now starting to gather momentum — new shows on Amazon Video and Netflix have already been shot using this aspect ratio (or very close to it). That's video covered, but it also makes more sense for multitasking with apps on bigger screens. With an 18:9 aspect ration you can have one app on top of another in portrait mode or use them side-by-side in landscape mode. There's also more to see on webpages and in those ubiquitous endless-scrolling apps where the content never stops, like Twitter and Tumblr. Stranger Things was shot in the new 18:9 aspect ratio. (Image: Netflix) Right now it's just too early to say whether 18:9 will take off, but if LG and Samsung commit themselves to the standard then it's got a great chance of getting a foothold in the market. Getting the entertainment industries to switch over may well be a longer process, but existing video formats still look fine on a 18:9 screen. As noted in our LG G6 review that extra height (or width, depending on how you're holding it) is something you quickly get used to. LG has been pretty clever with how it's used the extra space, one example being the way your most recent shots stack up at the side of the shutter window in the camera app. With two of the most popular smartphone makers leaning into this super aspect ratio this year there's a good chance 18:9 could be the new trend in smartphone displays — particularly those found on Android devices. But Apple and Google still have to announce their new phones in the fall. Which means these super wide phones might still just be a super fad. WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments ManualFunky @rickmyrundies Apr 3, 2017, 10:51am Why can a cinema ratio be 2.20:1 yet an LG phone has to be 18:9, instead of 2:1? Maybe, they could call it 2.00:1 to try and make it look more impressive, rather than trying to disguise the fact. Reply 1 horsesauce @horsesauce Apr 3, 2017, 11:39am I feel I'm alone in this but I try my best to avoid media consumption directly on my phone so I'm glad phone manufacturers are looking at other aspect ratios if they offer more utility for other features. (I also dislike the constantly increasing screen size for the same reason). A phone is mostly a tool for me, something to make my life easier and simpler, but not a device for *direct* media consumption. (I'll note that I have no issue with using a phone as a media host/pass-through, I listen to music through headphones and cast video from phone to T.V.) Reply 0 skrybe @skrybe Apr 3, 2017, 11:44am There have been too many phones launched since 2007 to mention them all individually, but the broad trend has been towards widescreen, 16:9 aspect ratios since the turn of the decade, first at 1,920 x 1,080 pixels (Full HD) and then at 2,560 x 1,440 pixels (Quad HD). Maybe you meant 1280x768 at the turn of the decade. Full HD: 1920x1080 didn't arrive until December 2012 and wasn't widespread until 2013. I thought the Sony Xperia Z was the first Full HD phone and it was Feb 2003. Although according to Wikipedia HTC Butterfly was the first released in December 2012, though it was Japan only. As for whether 18:9 (2:1) will be the new trend, maybe in high end. The low/mid range is unlikely to move that way anytime soon and that's where the bulk of sales are. The problem at the low/mid range becomes cost. 18:9 is ok at the high end when you're eliminating bezels and making crazy expensive devices. It's less effective when you're shaving dollars from the manufacturing costs. I suppose it'd be possible they've use a lower res variant with the 18:9 aspect ratio, something like 1280x640, maybe even 1920x960 but it would likely end up with a weird looking phone that still has large bezels and a tall, skinny screen. Reply 0 EasyBeezy Guest Apr 3, 2017, 1:28pm Full HD: 1920x1080 didn't arrive until December 2012 What? I bought my first 'big' TV in 2008, and got a 720p because it was on sale. They were liquidating stock because the 1080p TVs were coming in. I specifically remember people bugging me over the fact I'd bought a 720p when 1080p was the new thing. I'm pretty sure my Xbox 360 was capable of 1080p content in 2009 / 2010 as well. Reply 0 targeting compoita @poita Apr 3, 2017, 1:23pm Goddamnit!

But imagine if the NBN skipped your house or business because it wasn't easy enough?

It was his favorite setting for thought. Apple Park captures his spirit uncannily well,” said Laurene Powell Jobs. “He would have flourished, as the people of Apple surely will, on this luminously designed campus.” “Steve invested so much of his energy creating and supporting vital, creative environments. We have approached the design, engineering and making of our new campus with the same enthusiasm and design principles that characterize our products,” said Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer. “Connecting extraordinarily advanced buildings with rolling parkland creates a wonderfully open environment for people to create, collaborate and work together. We have been extremely fortunate to be able to work closely, over many years, with the remarkable architectural practice Foster + Partners.” CategoriesUncategorized TagsPress Release Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Apple takes supplier clean energy program to Japan Next PostNext Apple’s WWDC returns to San Jose June 5-9, 2017 Search Recent Posts Now Itchy.net.au Launches a Series of Natural Skin Care Products News “Designed by Apple in California” chronicles 20 years of Apple design Free Hour of Code workshops December 5 through 11 at every Apple Store Apple turns (RED) with more ways than ever to join the fight against AIDS Business Contacts Business Directory Proudly powered by WordPress
Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 April 2017 by Military News Apple joins RE100, announces supplier clean energy pledges Apple is already powering its operations in the US, China and 21 other countries with 100 percent renewable energy; and, in 2015, powered 93 percent of its operations around the world with renewable energy. The company continues to invest in high-quality, clean energy projects to help it meet and maintain its goal, and Jackson announced today that Apple has completed construction on its latest renewable energy project — a 50-megawatt solar farm in Arizona. Apple worked with local utility Salt River Project on the solar array, which will provide renewable power to Apple’s global command data center in Mesa, Arizona. That’s equal to the energy use of over 12,000 Arizona homes.

ITSHOW 2017 Search for: Home > Apple > All Three New iPhone Models This Year Will Feature True Tone Displays, Claims Report AppleNewsSmartphones All Three New iPhone Models This Year Will Feature True Tone Displays, Claims Report Babu Mohan April 1, 20170312 According to a new Barclays research note, all three iPhone models this year will be equipped with True Tone displays. Apple debuted the True Tone display feature with the 9.7-inch iPad Pro model that it released last year. Basically, the True Tone display uses four-channel sensors that adjust the white balance of the display to match the color temperature of the lighting around you. It not only works indoors, but outdoors as well, helping improve sunlight legibility further. On the iPhone 8, iPhone 7s, and iPhone 7s Plus, Apple will reportedly be using a “full spectral sensing” ambient light sensor to accurately gauge the color temperature of the surroundings. These sensors will be supplied by AMS, an Austrian semiconductor manufacturer. In addition to the new iPhone trio, the True Tone display feature is also expected to make its way to the second-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro model that is expected to be unveiled later this year. Based on rumors and reports available so far, the iPhone 8 will be equipped with an OLED display and could feature a high screen-to-body ratio with very thin bezels on all sides, similar to the recently announced Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. The regular iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models will retain the same IPS LCD displays as their predecessors and are rumored to be very similar in terms of the design as well.

With more and more applications being available for the device, increased use of its camera and background task-supporting applications such as Siri, battery life consumption also increases. Here are 5 tips that could help you save battery life on your iPhone: Popular Searches Rio Tinto PLC RIO ▼ 40.68 -0.40 -0.97% CSL Ltd CMXHF ▼ 94.50 -1.05 -1.10% Fortescue Metals Group Ltd FSUMF = 4.75 0.00 0.00% Lotte Shopping Co Ltd L9S ▲ 8.93 +0.07 +0.73% Turn off “Hey Siri”: The iPhone’s voice assistant Siri is always keen to listen to you. By default, it keeps working on the iPhone in the background, which means it also consumes battery. In case you don’t have the need for it, you can actually turn it off. To do so, navigate to Settings > General> Siri or Settings > Siri and then just switch the feature off.  Stop apps from refreshing in the background: Background App Refresh is a machine-learning feature, which helps apps learn when you frequently check them. It allows them to predict when you will check them next and lets them be prepared with the latest data. Since these apps run in the background, the feature uses battery. You can turn it off by navigating to Settings > General > Background App Refresh and switching it off. Start reducing screen brightness manually: Auto-brightness on the iPhone is a handy feature, but it again takes a lot of battery. It is advisable to set the brightness manually according to your needs. To set the maximum value of screen brightness available to the feature, you will need to navigate to Settings > Display & Brightness and reduce the brightness using the slider. Disable dynamic backgrounds: Dynamic backgrounds is a motion-based feature present in iOS devices — they are wallpapers that provide the user with the feeling of a little motion in them. In case you don’t have use for this feature, you can disable it by navigating to Settings > Wallpaper and choosing a wallpaper without such effects like the ones in the “Stills” section. Disable motion effects: Every iPhone user might be aware of the parallax effect, which makes the icons shake when you move your device. The effect provides icons with visual depth but also eats into the battery. To turn it off, you can navigate to Settings > General > Accessibility > Reduce motion and switch it off.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software New iOS 11 Concept Imagines a Completely Reinvented Home Screen By Uzair Ghani Mar 31, 2017 9Shares Share Tweet Submit An exciting new iOS 11 concept has emerged that imagines Apple’s new mobile OS with a brand new, redesigned home screen. New iOS 11 Concept is All About What Matters the Most Since the launch of the original iPhone, not much has changed in the iOS home screen department. But a new concept aims to reimagine everything we know about the iOS home screen so far. It not only brings new features to the table, but adds on top things that are essential to an even better mobile experience. Take a look at the images below and see for yourself what we are talking about. Related iOS 11 Messages App Will Have Deep Siri Integration, Will Learn User Behavior, More It all starts with the app icons themselves, which you are absolutely free to place wherever you want. And if that doesn’t sound good enough, Apple Watch like Complications can be placed on the home screen as well. This means all your key information is just a glance away. Widgets, no longer live in the Today view, and are free to be placed anywhere on the home screen, the way it should be. Notifications get a huge upgrade as well, and users are no longer required to look at badges. Instead, they’ll be greeted with a slightly more detailed view so they know exactly what they’re dealing with even before they launch the app. Advertisement Siri is getting a lick of paint as well, and comes with a dedicated button right on the home screen. Tapping that launches the Siri interface with all the useful information right at your fingertips. App Suggestions from Siri are imagined to be far more useful as well. This means you are no longer met with hit or miss suggestions given your location or your current activities. There’s a lot of focus on Siri in this iOS 11 concept, and we dig it a lot. But the question remains: will Apple share the same taste in functionality as the designer himself? Well, we can’t say at all. What we can say is that WWDC 2017 is just around the corner, and we will know in a while what the Cupertino giant has in store for us.

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States Streaming Music Is Top Music Industry Revenue Generator By Paul Ausick March 31, 2017 10:15 am EDT Print Email Tweet Just over half (51.4%) of the music industry’s 2016 $7.7 billion in revenues were generated by streaming services like Spotify and Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) Apple Music, and by streaming radio services like Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: SIRI). Streaming revenues rose 68% year over year to a total of $3.9 billion. Offsetting the increase in streaming revenues, sales of digital downloads fell by 22% year over year to about $1.8 billion and sales of physical products — CDs and vinyl albums — dropped 16% to $1.7 billion. The data were reported Thursday by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), which represents the country’s largest players in the recorded music business. The RIAA report noted: Although our 2016 revenue report catalogues substantial overall improvement for the industry, revenues are still only about half what they were in 1999, and revenues from more traditional unit-based sales (physical products and digital downloads) continued to decline significantly. Since 2011, industry revenues from streaming have risen from 9% to 51%, with the largest year-over-year jump occurring between 2015 and 2016 when the percentage increase rose by 17%. The number of paid streaming subscribers has risen from 3.4 million in 2012 to 22.6 million last year, and year-over-year growth in paid subscribers was more than 100%. RIAA Chairman and CEO Cary Sherman noted that it remains to be seen if streaming revenues will be able to offset losses in downloads and sales of physical products. He took special aim at Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) YouTube: The unfortunate reality is that we have achieved this modest success in spite of our current music licensing and copyright laws, not because of them. That’s not the way it should be. For example, it makes no sense that it takes a thousand on-demand streams of a song for creators to earn $1 on YouTube, while services like Apple and Spotify pay creators $7 or more for those same streams. Why does this happen? Because a platform like YouTube wrongly exploits legal loopholes to pay creators at rates well below the true value of music while other digital services — including many new and small innovators — cannot. It may be the same song requested by the user, on the same device, but the payouts differ enormously because of an unfair and out-of-date legal regime. The RIAA has its sights set on revamping the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA) to level the playing field. Ironically, Sherman also pats the RIAA on its back for “years of patiently nurturing a nascent streaming marketplace” that is finally beginning to pay off. The industry has only come around to streaming in the past couple of years, after fighting it for years. Funny how money changes everything.

Top News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter App International Edition Monday April 3, 2017 About Us Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Business Company Focus Africa Middle East Europe Americas Asia Global Markets CEO Talks Samsung's Bixby in tough challenge to rivals By Rob Lever, AFP  Monday, April 3, 2017, 12:07 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet A- A+ 中文 Washington -- Samsung's Bixby is the new kid on the block of personal digital assistants and is likely to face a rough reception in a neighborhood dominated by tech sector rivals. Bixby — introduced at Samsung's unveiling of Galaxy S8 smartphones — aims to help the South Korean giant break into a surging market for voice-activated virtual assistants, which includes Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana. The latest personal digital assistant distinguishes itself from competitors by using voice commands rather than touch to control handsets or applications, factoring in location awareness and image recognition. The integrated camera function allows users to identify buildings, such as popular tourist sites, to access their websites and other information simply by snapping a photo. The photo recognition technology can also help users decipher menus in foreign languages, or find places to shop for specific items they photograph. "It impressed me that they were doing image recognition and context awareness," said Bob O'Donnell, analyst and consultant with Technalysis Research, who attended the presentation. "It adds some new twists we haven't seen before," he said, noting Bixby's ability to make recommendations. Yet Bixby is still a work in progress — the virtual entity did not speak at the New York demonstration. It has yet to be infused with technology from Samsung's recently acquired Viv, a company founded by creators of Apple's Siri. "It's not talking yet," O'Donnell said. "They have room to expand and grow." Tough Competitors Bixby will face competition from established players — even from Samsung's own phones, where users can choose to use Assistant, Cortana or Alexa. Richard Windsor, an independent analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog, said Bixby may face problems because the "best-in-class Google Assistant" will be on the home button of the new phone, which is powered by Google-backed Android software. That means Bixby has a "fearsome competitor" on its own flagship device, according to the analyst. "Bixby is trying to do things a little differently but careful assessment of what Samsung demonstrated shows a service that has very little intelligence at all," Windsor said. 1|2|Next Page>> NEXT ARTICLE Panama Papers: a boost to the battle over tax, but no silver bullet Facebook Twitter Google+ Write a Comment Terms Enter your comments - 3000 characters max Type in image code  Receive our promos  Respond to this email Submit MOST POPULAR OF THIS SECTION 1 Now that the US is out, Beijing authorities may be interested in attending TPP talks 2 Reports of TSMC's US plant rattle Taiwan 3 TSMC still considering plans for 3nm chip production 4 Why analysts believed TSMC was looking elsewhere 5 China trims 2017 growth target, warns against trade controls 6 Nintendo Switch console goes on sale across world 7 Invest in Taiwan, President Tsai urges Taiwanese businesses in N.

According to my estimates, there are 100M users still using older iPads (iPad 1, iPad 2, iPad 3, iPad 4, iPad mini). A significant portion of these users are using devices that don't even support the latest iOS release. Management thinks simpler storytelling and an aggressively low $329 price will entice these users to upgrade to the new 9.7-inch iPad. The fact that 100M people are still using older iPads demonstrates that the product provides value. Apple is also confident that users will see the significant improvement between the latest iPads and models from five to seven years ago. As for PC users, Apple thinks the iPad Pro line is capable of handling the vast majority of tasks currently given to laptops. Apple looks at the iPad Pro line, which includes Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard, as a better solution for consumers than even the Mac. This is quite telling as to management's long-term motivation. Strong iPad updates in this year's iOS release would certainly help Apple steer the iPad's narrative in a new direction.

Tech Apple Science Cars Baselworld 2017 Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     IPhone 8 Will Feature True Tone Display Posted: Apr 2 2017, 11:11am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Apr 2 2017, 9:17pm CDT, in Rumors | Apple     With Samsung Galaxy S8 officially announced, all the concern has now shifted to iPhone 8. Resources fight over authenticity of each other’s reports while numerous other rumors keep surfacing daily. One rumor which is unanimously agreed upon by most of the resources is that Apple has 3 new iPhone models in their line-up this year. iPhone 7S, iPhone 7S Plus, and the iPhone 8 (or iPhone X) being those three. Don't Miss: Find a Nintendo NES Classic in stock Of these three, iPhone 8 is expected to be the real horseman out of these three models. Not only that, even the rumors specifically point to iPhone 8 as this year’s most advanced handset in Apple’s line-up with high-end features, top-notch performance and fancy design. For instance, the “truly bezel-less” front panel in iPhone 8 eliminates even the remotest possibilities of a physical home button, while rumors highly suggest that a function bar (or function area) will take place under the screen where the physical button used to be. Many popular analysists second these rumors of a function area feature in the upcoming iPhone 8. Barclays specifically, also highly suggests that iPhone 8 will also be featuring a “complete spectral sensing” system for its display. Those who are unclear with the terminology, the spectral sensing system is the core component required to achieve “True Tone” display. True Tone display is basically a brightness/contrast management system which inputs the light data from the environment using these sensors. The system then configures the sharpness, brightness, contrast, and temperature of the display screen to match with the lighting of the environment. It’s really an amazing feature in the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and people who have experienced it would unconditionally fall in love with iPhone 8 if it features the True Tone display.

The photo-recognition technology can also help users decipher menus in foreign languages, or find places to shop for specific items they photograph. "It impressed me that they were doing image recognition and context awareness," said Bob O'Donnell, analyst and consultant with Technalysis Research, who attended the presentation. "It adds some new twists we haven't seen before," he said, noting Bixby's ability to make recommendations. READ: Samsung voice-assistant Bixby to debut with new phone Yet Bixby is still a work in progress -- the virtual entity did not speak at the New York demonstration. It has yet to be infused with technology from Samsung's recently acquired Viv, a company founded by creators of Apple's Siri. "It's not talking yet," O'Donnell said. "They have room to expand and grow."  Tough competitors  Bixby will face competition from established players, even from Samsung's own phones, where users can choose to use Assistant, Cortana or Alexa. Richard Windsor, an independent analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog, said Bixby may face problems because the "best-in-class Google Assistant" will be on the home button of the new phone, which is powered by Google-backed Android software. That means Bixby has a "fearsome competitor" on its own flagship device, according to the analyst. "Bixby is trying to do things a little differently but careful assessment of what Samsung demonstrated shows a service that has very little intelligence at all," Windsor said. Roger Kay of Endpoint Technologies Associates said Bixby might face challenges catching up with its rivals, which have been deployed for some time. "You can't build these things overnight," Kay said. "It would take years to create something as developed as Siri." Still, he noted, it is important for Samsung to be in the game. "These are table stakes," Kay said. "You can't not deal with voice. It's hands-free and can summarise a lot of things quickly." READ: Apple, Samsung vow to fix flaws after CIA hacking report Amazon appears to have impacted the sector the most with its connected speakers using Alexa. The service allows users a wide range of voice interactions for music, news, purchases and connects with smart home devices. "Alexa is the top dog," Kay said. "Amazon has done the best work from a commercial perspective. They took it out of the theoretical to put it to work for things people want to do."  Beyond the phone  Samsung has also promoted Bixby as a remote hub for connected devices, which is another challenge as it takes the software beyond the smartphone. Patrick Moorhead, analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, said Bixby's success in the connected home may depend on how much data it can collect. "Machine learning gets better the more training it gets and the more data it gets," Moorhead said. While Bixby cannot benefit from the large databases of competitors Apple and Windows, it could potentially sync with Samsung electronics and smart home appliances through Samsung's SmartThings platform. "Samsung ships so many devices from phones to Chromebooks to washing machines, it is picking up a different set of information, so it might end up being smarter than Siri," he said. "Siri doesn't know what's in your refrigerator, Samsung does." The app faces an uphill battle in a fragmented market where competing platforms don't always work together. Moorhead said tech companies are jockeying for a position in order to "get access to data - by using this interface they can build detailed profiles on you."     AFP Comment Now!

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile New 9.7-Inch iPad Teardown: Is This Just Another iPad Air From the Inside? By Omar Sohail Mar 30, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple is not known for announcing cheaper products, but with the $329 9.7-inch iPad 2017, it looks like the company might be looking into other strategies to revive the tablet market. However, with the base model being priced at $329, there were obviously some trade-offs that the tech giant had to make in order to sell you the slate at this price. Fortunately, the dexterous crew at iFixit managed to get their hands on a unit, revealing some very interesting things about the product. New 9.7-Inch iPad Is Very Difficult to Repair and it Looks Like the Innards Are Near-Identical to the iPad Air During the teardown process, iFixit revealed that the slate looks very similar to the original iPad Air from the inside. In the image posted below, it has been detailed that the iPad Air features a bigger Wi-Fi module as opposed to the 2017 iPad. Other than that, the slates have virtually no differences between them. Even with its $329 base price tag, Apple is attempting to make this product difficult to repair as the repairability score came to 2 out of 10. What this means is that some parts of the slate are easy to remove and repair or replace, while others are a complete nightmare. Related SoundCloud For iOS Gains Support For Chromecast, Shared Playback And More The conclusion from iFixit has been detailed below regarding which parts were difficult to remove and which ones weren’t: “The LCD is easy to remove once the front panel is separated from the iPad. The battery is not soldered to the logic board. We’ll give it that. Related Apple’s Free App Of The Week Is A Popular Puzzler – $0.99 Value Advertisement Just like in previous iPads, the front panel is glued to the rest of the device, greatly increasing the chances of cracking the glass during a repair. Gobs of adhesive hold everything in place. As with its Air 1 predecessor, this ranks among the most difficult battery removal procedures we’ve seen in an iPad. The LCD has foam sticky tape adhering it to the front panel, increasing chances of it being shattered during disassembly. You can’t access the front panel’s connector until you remove the LCD.” Other details revealed in the teardown mention 2GB of LPDDR4 RAM and a 32.9Whr battery (8,827mAh) being parts of the hardware specifications. We are assuming that these were some of the contributions why the iPad’s price tag starts at $329, but honestly, we were expecting at least 3GB of RAM. After finding out several things about the slate, would you still want to purchase it? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.

According to the Japanese newspaper, there are now 10 bidders looking to buy Toshiba's lucrative semiconductor operation, which accounts for 20 percent of the NAND market. Nikkei reported on Friday that U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake and U.S. chipmaker Broadcom offered Toshiba about 2 trillion yen ($18 billion) for the unit. Other bidders include frontrunner and world's largest NAND flash maker, Western Digital, with Apple suppliers Foxconn and TSMC having been named early on as potential suitors. "The US tech firms -- Apple, Google and Amazon -- have become the next attractive bidders following Western Digital as Toshiba can have stable supply chains (for smartphones or data servers) from them," an industry source told The Korea Herald.On Thursday, Toshiba shareholders agreed to split off the NAND flash unit and sell it, in order to raise at least $9 billion to cover U.S. nuclear unit charges that threaten the conglomerate's future. Both Apple and Samsung are major clients of the unit, while Google and Amazon want to buy the NAND maker to supply their own data servers, rather than having to rely on chipmakers. Prices on the flash memory market remain high, while Apple's interest in acquiring the unit has only increased as it continues to boost the storage capacity of its iPhones and iPads. Buying the unit would not only provide Apple with the ability to design and make its own flash memory, but it would also mean Samsung losing its main client. How much Apple's offer amounts to remains unknown, however.

Don't fool yourself. Apple wants it to increase profits, not to increase base storage in their devices. Rating: 11 Votes 69Mustang 13 hours ago at 11:08 am I hate to break it to you, but in business terms, it's called Vertical Integration. And it would indeed mean a change in strategy. Study business or get an MBA and you'll understand. I hate to break it to you, but in this case, vertical integration does nothing for Apple. It would simply mean they are tied to their own NAND chips for the foreseeable future. Unless their plans include entering the NAND market as a vendor, then this deal would make even less sense. Fabs are cash intensive, low margin properties. They typically subsist on volume. Apple's volume might be great, but if they are solely supplying themselves then the fab is nothing but expensive overhead with no appreciable benefit. A stake in a bidder makes more sense. Studying business or getting an MBA won't overcome the generalities in your quote. The specifics of Apple's business model carries far more weight than studying generic business principles. Rating: 10 Votes Glassed Silver 17 hours ago at 07:19 am The three biggest tech firms, in their respective category, Apple, Google, Amazon, changing their strategy at the same moment and moving into owning semiconductor fabs? Colour me skeptical. What do you mean by change of strategy? All three of them have solid reasons to cut the middleman and create their own NAND. Amazon and Google operate a lot of cloud infrastructure. Apple is trying to expand the amount of self-managed cloud infrastructure and at the same time could use the NAND for the many devices they sell. Amazon and Google are OEMs as well, so partially that reason applies to them as well. We've seen for quite some time now that NAND is incredibly important to keep at low price price points, the more you can do to achieve that the more of an edge over your competitors you have. Apple continues to become more generous with storage prices on iOS devices, I hope this would mean we could potentionally see the same come to the Mac.... if they win the bidding war that is. I don't think generous is the right term when you consider how much they milked the 16GB cow and similarly 32GB now (on "Pro" models nonetheless).

If they wanted to win, they could. Rating: 6 Votes wigby 13 hours ago at 10:51 am Apple NEEDS to win this. There's no excuse for it not to with the largest market cap and massive treasure trove of liquid cash that it's just sitting on and doing nothing with. If Apple doesn't win this, then heads do need to roll. There has been too many high profile missteps, and executive cluelessness, and stifling corporate group think , all while key competitors are surpasing Apple in existing markets and beating them handedly in new markets and technologies. Controlling the NAND chip market could buy them some time in playing catch up. You're overreacting and know nothing about the details of this purchase. They are probably still trying to determine if it's a good for for them and maybe just trying to drive up the price for others. Apple already does control the NAND chip market in a sense. They place the largest orders and have the most money. That means they get the best prices and their orders are prioritized. It also means they suck the air out of the room and make competitors choke for supply. Buying into a large fab business like this isn't all upside. Remember the debacle for a small acquisition like the sapphire plant? [doublepost=1491155959][/doublepost] Meaning they decided to bid in order to then deliberately fail? Sorry, but I understand neither your point nor why Aston441 upvoted it. They're not bidding anonymously on EBay. Bidding directly against competitors changes not only the dollar amount but the rational behind the bidding.

Controlling the NAND chip market could buy them some time in playing catch up. Quatsch. Nobody ever controlled a market with 20% share of anything. Apple's only interest here is ensuring flexible and diverse long term supply of such memory or its technological successor at the lowest possible price from as many suppliers as possible. Once you buy your own, you are wedded to it even if a better or more affordable alternative emerges. Wedded until the pain becomes too great that not moving to that alternative endangers your main business. A great part of Apple's success has been its ability to play multiple suppliers off against each other to get the desired component at the best price. It is Apple's interest to continue that arrangement. Only if the argument can be made that Apple is better off acquiring a company due to a strategic opportunity offered by its tech will it go the vertical integration route. If the price goes too high and there is no strategic IP that Apple risks losing, watch Apple rightly walk away. Rating: 4 Votes newyorkone 17 hours ago at 07:13 am We all know Apple won't win this.

"Apple," shouts one man from a tiny boat in the Atlantic. "Avocado," replies a crewmate. "Uh...banana," the third man answers. This may sound like the rantings of three men who have lost their minds - perhaps they are castaways, set adrift after some terrible disaster? But no, these three men, one of them from Plymouth, are attempting to cross the second largest ocean on Earth. Completing this imaginary alphabetical shopping list is an attempt to keep the boredom at bay. In just a few weeks they will complete the Talisker Whisky Challenge as it's officially known - making history as the first British trio to successfully cross the Atlantic unsupported. Amidst a cacophony of victory flares and cheers from the crowd as they reach the coast, they will become world record holders. Looking back on it all now, sat in a quiet cafe in the city centre, Plympton's Andy Sacker is awe-struck by the whole experience. "I'm privileged to have done it," he says. "It feels a bit surreal. When we came back there was the madness of the media. We sat down in a bar in Antigua and was just this nice feeling to know we just quietly had this world record. "It was mind-blowing. I would definitely do it again and I'd want to cross the Atlantic on my own - it would be great to conquer it independently." Andy is full of stories of his time at sea - rowing through shoals of flying fish, pushing an oar through bio-luminescent plankton in the dead of night and watching them ripple and glow, waves taller than two men lifting their boat up and dropping it as if they were on a rollercoaster. In order to enjoy any of that though, Andy first had to overcome extreme seasickness. He suffered so badly beforehand that a skipper on a sailing exercise once questioned if he needed medical help. "He thought I had a virus, that I needed a doctor," Andy says. "I had to find a way to overcome it. It was a great feeling when I finally went a day without being sick on this expedition. Then it was two days, three days, and I felt myself getting better. "All those things that happen - the sickness, my crewmate cut his ankle quite badly - all of it was worth it. You can have a rotten day getting battered by the water, next minute you see a pod of dolphins and it's not so bad." Andy would need to dig deep into the mental well of positivity when the boat's power failed on just the second day. "The naviagation let us down," he says. "We should have had lights that came on and automatic steering which is so much easier. "You're on your bum, doing your rowing and there's an LED display a long way in front of you. It's got lots of information on it, but you can only really see your speed at that distance. "When that went kaput one of us went to the steering position, one of us rowed and the other rested." Andy has previously trekked to the North Pole, but admitted this challenge was tougher for him than anything the arctic chucked at him. "Our duty officer said 80 per cent of this challenge his upstairs," Andy points to his head. "Yes, you need to know your sea survival, your navigation - the important stuff. But you need a good mindset too. If you can have a really bad day, but have a good attitude you'll be ok. "This challenge wouldn't be for everyone. For me it keeps your heart beating and it's an incredible feeling, out in the elements, doing your things." Getting back on dry land was an equally strange experience. After the media storm, Andy retreated to his hotel room and stared out across the ocean he had just conquered. "You have that isolation and then suddenly you're surrounded by people and noise. It was madness. We had a beer and a meal and then went to our hotel. "I got cleaned up and went for a walk along the resort and sat in a chair for about an hour just taking it all in. I was just thinking how we'd crossed that. "I would go back there right now if someone gave me £50,000." There were a lot of people who advised Andy not to go ahead with this challenge, but he doesn't think in terms of proving them wrong. "It's not a case of saying, 'Up yours, I've done it," he laughs. "All of us have challenges, it could be something as simple as getting out of bed. I guess maybe I'm thinking if people know what I've gone through it might give them the extra courage to do better. "I want to inspire people. There's nothing you can't do if you put your mind to it and gain the skills you need."

With more and more applications being available for the device, increased use of its camera and background task-supporting applications such as Siri, battery life consumption also increases. Here are 5 tips that could help you save battery life on your iPhone: Turn off “Hey Siri”: The iPhone’s voice assistant Siri is always keen to listen to you. By default, it keeps working on the iPhone in the background, which means it also consumes battery. In case you don’t have the need for it, you can actually turn it off. To do so, navigate to Settings > General> Siri or Settings > Siri and then just switch the feature off.  Read:  Apple Might Integrate Siri in iCloud Stop apps from refreshing in the background: Background App Refresh is a machine-learning feature, which helps apps learn when you frequently check them. It allows them to predict when you will check them next and lets them be prepared with the latest data. Since these apps run in the background, the feature uses battery. You can turn it off by navigating to Settings > General > Background App Refresh and switching it off. Start reducing screen brightness manually: Auto-brightness on the iPhone is a handy feature, but it again takes a lot of battery. It is advisable to set the brightness manually according to your needs. To set the maximum value of screen brightness available to the feature, you will need to navigate to Settings > Display & Brightness and reduce the brightness using the slider. Disable dynamic backgrounds: Dynamic backgrounds is a motion-based feature present in iOS devices — they are wallpapers that provide the user with the feeling of a little motion in them. In case you don’t have use for this feature, you can disable it by navigating to Settings > Wallpaper and choosing a wallpaper without such effects like the ones in the “Stills” section. Read: iOS 10.3 Drains Battery On iPhone 6S Disable motion effects: iPhone users might be aware of the screen motion effect, which provides icons with visual depth but also eats into the battery. To turn it off, you can navigate to Settings > General > Accessibility > Reduce motion.

Opinion Op-Ed Op-Ed Your way of life would not be remotely possible without Wall Street Wall Street Frank Franklin II / AP The New York Stock Exchange building in New York. The New York Stock Exchange building in New York. (Frank Franklin II / AP) William Cohan At $500 million in box office revenue and counting, we sure love Disney’s new movie “Beauty and the Beast.” With more than 1 billion sold, we sure love Apple’s iPhone. The same goes for Netflix, Chevy pickups, wide-screen televisions and grocery store aisles stocked high with fresh fruit and vegetables. But for some reason, we hate the one entity that brought all these things within reach of most Americans: Wall Street. Our way of life would not be remotely possible without the interstitial role played by Wall Street. It’s the left ventricle of capitalism. Yet Wall Street has become shorthand for everything that is wrong with the American economic system. And yes, Wall Street is partly to blame for its reputation. It constructed a black box around itself to keep what it does hidden from prying eyes. What happens there is not actually that complicated, but Wall Street wants you to think it is. It’s easy to hate bankers. But if we want to actually fix what’s wrong with Wall Street, we will need to stop mindlessly villainizing it. Wall Street also exacerbated the 2008 financial crisis and was not held accountable. Worse, at the same time that American taxpayers bailed out big banks to the tune of trillions, Wall Street’s bankers, traders and executives helped themselves to billions in bonuses. As a result, one politician after another has lambasted Wall Street for every imaginable evil. Right after Wall Street CEOs helped themselves to those bonuses, President Obama reminded some of them in a now-infamous April 2009 meeting that his administration was “the only thing between you and the pitchforks.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has made a career of attacking high finance, going so far as to block Antonio Weiss, Obama’s nominee for Treasury undersecretary, from confirmation by the Senate merely because he worked on Wall Street. (Of course, she made no mention of the $1.6-million advance she received for her 2014 book, “A Fighting Chance,” a sum that would be inconceivable without Wall Street’s willingness to finance her publisher.) Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont based his entire presidential campaign on decrying Wall Street and the awful people who work there. And Hillary Clinton jumped all over Wall Street to secure the Democratic nomination — despite having taken some $10 million in speaking fees from financial firms after finishing her term as secretary of State. Perhaps the biggest hypocrite of them all, President Trump criticized Wall Street to no end during his presidential campaign, only to then surround himself with Wall Street bankers and lawyers after winning the election. With so much sanctimony on the national stage, it’s easy to hate bankers. But if we want to actually fix what’s wrong with Wall Street, we will need to stop mindlessly villainizing it. In the most basic terms: Wall Street provides capital at a fair price to people who want it, by borrowing it from people who have it and want to invest it. It’s a simple service, and without it, we might as well go back to the Middle Ages, when people never ventured far from their tiny villages and spent their days worrying about their next meal. Wall Street put the Internet at our collective fingertips. It’s the reason more than 160 million Americans have credit cards and access to an unsecured line of credit anytime they may want to use it. It democratized jet travel, which now allows average people to get halfway around the world in the time it used to take a fisherman to get his cod to market. Few people who have these things would be willing to give them up. The problem with Wall Street is its incentive and compensation system, which encourages bankers, traders and executives to take big risks with other people’s money. It rewards greed and recklessness without imposing accountability. This system was a main cause of the 2008 financial crisis. Wall Street bankers and traders were rewarded with huge bonuses for packaging shoddy mortgages that they knew, or should have known, would never be paid back into securities and selling them off as investments around the world. They did so because that’s exactly what they got paid to do. We need a new incentive system on Wall Street, one that encourages risk-taking, innovation and creativity, while also holding the people who work there accountable where it hurts — in their wallets — when things go wrong, as they inevitably will again. Trump and the Republicans in Congress seem determined to gut the financial regulations implemented after the financial crisis — the very rules designed to prevent another one from happening. In truth, the financial reform legislation is flawed. The length of the Dodd-Frank law alone, some 848 pages, is evidence of this, and so is the difficulty that small- and medium-sized businesses still have in getting access to capital. But this moment requires a scalpel, not a sledgehammer. Some provisions of Dodd-Frank are worth preserving, including requirements that banks have more capital. It’s a good thing that many complicated derivatives — financial bets on how the price of copper will move or whether a GE bond will default — are now traded on exchanges, where their prices can be more easily discovered. But other parts of the regulatory regime should be scrapped. For instance, it’s beyond ridiculous that one bank employee in five is tasked with monitoring what the other four do all day, and that big banks must endure the laborious and expensive annual process of creating “living wills” and withstanding “stress tests.” These are bureaucratic exercises with no practical usefulness. If a bank fails because of poor risk management, so be it. Let’s toss the notion of “too big to fail” into the dustbin of history, where it belongs. Although he has little political capital left after the healthcare debacle, Trump should move toward a grand bargain with Wall Street. In exchange for repealing regulations that gum up the works, Trump should demand that Wall Street change its compensation system to reward prudent risk-taking and accountability. A combination of smart regulation and smart incentives will insure that Wall Street can play its essential role while also penalizing bankers, traders and executives if they dare to blow things up again. William D. Cohan, a former Wall Street investment banker, is a special correspondent for Vanity Fair and the author most recently of “Why Wall Street Matters.” Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Big Sur's broken bridge means a return to the quiet place it once was.

The stock also surpassed a per-share price of $1,000 when adjusted for Apple's 7-for-1 stock split in June 2014. Apple now has a market valuation of over $750 billion on its path towards becoming the world's first trillion dollar company. The milestone comes as longtime Apple analyst turned venture capitalist Gene Munster told CNBC that now remains a "golden opportunity" to buy Apple stock. Munster's new firm Loup Ventures has a $180 to $200 price range for AAPL, and he expects "clear sailing" for Apple investors in the months ahead. Apple analyst Brian White of brokerage firm Drexel Hamilton maintained his "buy" rating for AAPL today, with a price target of $185. He continues to believe that Apple remains "among the most underappreciated stocks in the world" and that "Apple has Samsung on the ropes like never before in recent memory." An excerpt from White's latest research note obtained by MacRumors: With Apple operating on all cylinders and a strong iPhone launch expected this fall, combined with the rise of more China-based competitors, we believe the pressure is on Samsung to deliver a strong upgrade without any missteps. We believe if Samsung stumbles again, the company's position in the smartphone market could be permanently impaired.Apple analyst Steven Milunovich of investment bank UBS has maintained his "buy" rating for AAPL as well, with a price target of $151 set in late February. In a bullish scenario where Apple has "caught the next major trend," he believes the stock's price could reach $200 within the next two years or so. Apple is widely expected to benefit from another "supercycle" of iPhone upgrades this year, given a "larger than ever" base of existing customers with an iPhone 6 or older device. Apple's stock price has also been fueled by excitement surrounding a rumored 5.8-inch iPhone with an edge-to-edge OLED display. Update: AAPL closed at $144.12 on Wednesday, setting yet another all-time high.

People have been saying this for the last 5 years. Well, the last 10/15 years. People always waiting for it to go down, then snap it up. But the shares over the long term have just gone up and up. If we bought shares a few years ago when the prices were through the roof and everybody thought it'd plummet, we'd still have made a wicked profit by now. Apple are going to become infinitely more wealthy in the next 5 years. That much I can guarantee. They've got their fingers in so many pies, with technology that is in its infancy and has so much potential to grow. If anybody's on the fence, I'd just say buy now and hug the stock for the next half-decade.

Is Apple planning to reintroduce the MagSafe connector? by Joe Roberts 21 hours ago 0 shares Read Comments Apple's latest MacBook updates were undoubtedly sleek-looking machines, especially the ones with the fancy new Touch Bar strip above the keyboard. But as is the fashion these days, the company decided to do away with a load of ports and connections in the pursuit of an ever slimmer chasis. And one of the casualties in this latest round of porticide, much to the dismay of users around the world, was the beloved MagSafe connector. The power port design used magnets to ensure if someone tripped over the charging cable, it would simply disconnect rather than bring the laptop tumbling off the desk. Related: iPhone 8 But Apple opted to add a load of USB Type-C, or Lightning, ports to its latest round of MacBooks – though, it now seems the erstwhile MagSafe connector could make a return in the future. That is, if Cupertino follows through with this latest patent (via) which details what it refers to as a "magnetic adapter”. The device in the patent is a MagSafe connector design with a Universal Serial Bus Type-C connector insert, which basically means you would be able to add the MagSafe port to a MacBook by just plugging in this small adapter. Interestingly, the charging cable shown in the patent diagrams is an older design. What that means remains unclear – is this an adapter that can only be used with older charging cables? If so, why on earth would Apple want to limit it like that? Of course, there's no guarantee this device will ever make it to the production phase, as Apple files for patents all the time that never come to anything. But we'd expect such a device to do quite well were it ever released, so we're hopeful that we'll see the MagSafe adapter arrive in the future. Let us know if you'd like to see the MagSafe connector return in the comments. 0 shares Read Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Free Newsletter Get TrustedReviews' award-winning reviews, opinions and advice delivered to your inbox for free!

Home Technology Consumer & Gadgets April 2, 2017 Samsung's assistant Bixby in tough challenge to rivals April 2, 2017 by Rob Lever The new Samsung S8, incorporating its virtual assistant Bixby, seen on display in New York Samsung's Bixby is the new kid on the block of personal digital assistants and is likely to face a rough reception in a neighborhood dominated by tech sector rivals. Bixby—introduced at Samsung's unveiling of Galaxy S8 smartphones—aims to help the South Korean giant break into a surging market for voice-activated virtual assistants, which includes Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana. The latest personal digital assistant distinguishes itself from competitors by using voice commands rather than touch to control handsets or applications, factoring in location awareness and image recognition. The integrated camera function allows users to identify buildings, such as popular tourist sites, to access their websites and other information simply by snapping a photo. The photo recognition technology can also help users decipher menus in foreign languages, or find places to shop for specific items they photograph. "It impressed me that they were doing image recognition and context awareness," said Bob O'Donnell, analyst and consultant with Technalysis Research, who attended the presentation. "It adds some new twists we haven't seen before," he said, noting Bixby's ability to make recommendations. Yet Bixby is still a work in progress—the virtual entity did not speak at the New York demonstration. It has yet to be infused with technology from Samsung's recently acquired Viv, a company founded by creators of Apple's Siri. "It's not talking yet," O'Donnell said. "They have room to expand and grow." Sriram Thodla, senior director of services and new business at Samsung, speaks about the new voice assistant named 'Bixby' that is featured on the new Galaxy S8, in New York, March 29, 2017 Tough competitors Bixby will face competition from established players—even from Samsung's own phones, where users can choose to use Assistant, Cortana or Alexa. Richard Windsor, an independent analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog, said Bixby may face problems because the "best-in-class Google Assistant" will be on the home button of the new phone, which is powered by Google-backed Android software. That means Bixby has a "fearsome competitor" on its own flagship device, according to the analyst. "Bixby is trying to do things a little differently but careful assessment of what Samsung demonstrated shows a service that has very little intelligence at all," Windsor said. Roger Kay of Endpoint Technologies Associates said Bixby might face challenges catching up with its rivals, which have been deployed for some time. "You can't build these things overnight," Kay said. "It would take years to create something as developed as Siri." Still, he noted, it is important for Samsung to be in the game. "These are table stakes," Kay said. "You can't not deal with voice. It's hands-free and can summarize a lot of things quickly." Amazon appears to have impacted the sector the most with its connected speakers using Alexa. The service allows users a wide range of voice interactions for music, news, purchases and connects with smart home devices. The new version of the Samsung Gear 360 camera is seen on display during a launch event for the Samsung Galaxy S8, in New York, on March 29, 2017 "Alexa is the top dog," Kay said. "Amazon has done the best work from a commercial perspective. They took it out of the theoretical to put it to work for things people want to do." Beyond the phone Samsung has also promoted Bixby as a remote hub for connected devices, which is another challenge as it takes the software beyond the smartphone. Patrick Moorhead, analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, said Bixby's success in the connected home may depend on how much data it can collect. "Machine learning gets better the more training it gets and the more data it gets," Moorhead said. While Bixby cannot benefit from the large databases of competitors Apple and Windows, it could potentially sync with Samsung electronics and smart home appliances through Samsung's SmartThings platform. "Samsung ships so many devices from phones to Chromebooks to washing machines, it is picking up a different set of information, so it might end up being smarter than Siri," he said. "Siri doesn't know what's in your refrigerator, Samsung does." The app faces an uphill battle in a fragmented market where competing platforms don't always work together.

SEOUL: Samsung’s Bixby is the new kid on the block of personal digital assistants and is likely to face a rough reception in a neighbourhood dominated by tech sector rivals. Bixby was introduced at Samsung’s unveiling of the Galaxy S8 smartphones, it aims to help the South Korean giant break into a surging market for voice-activated virtual assistants, which includes Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant and Microsoft’s Cortana. The latest personal digital assistant distinguishes itself from competitors by using voice commands rather than touch to control handsets or applications, factoring in location awareness and image recognition. The integrated camera function allows users to identify buildings, such as popular tourist sites, to access their websites and other information simply by snapping a photo. The photo recognition technology can also help users decipher menus in foreign languages, or find places to shop for specific items they photograph. “It impressed me that they were doing image recognition and context awareness,” said Bob O’Donnell, analyst and consultant with Technalysis Research, who attended the presentation. “It adds some new twists we haven’t seen before,” he said, noting Bixby’s ability to make recommendations. Yet Bixby is still a work in progress the virtual entity did not speak at the New York demonstration. It has yet to be infused with technology from Samsung’s recently acquired Viv, a company founded by creators of Apple’s Siri. “It’s not talking yet,” O’Donnell said. “They have room to expand and grow.” Bixby faces competition from established players, even from Samsung’s own phones, where users can choose to use Assistant, Cortana or Alexa. Richard Windsor, an independent analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog, said Bixby may face problems because the “best-in-class Google Assistant” will be on the home button of the new phone, which is powered by Google-backed Android software. That means Bixby has a “fearsome competitor” on its own flagship device, according to the analyst. “Bixby is trying to do things a little differently but careful assessment of what Samsung demonstrated shows a service that has very little intelligence at all,” Windsor said. Roger Kay of Endpoint Technologies Associates said Bixby might face challenges catching up with its rivals, which have been deployed for some time. “You can’t build these things overnight,” Kay said. “It would take years to create something as developed as Siri.” Still, he noted, it is important for Samsung to be in the game. “These are table stakes,” Kay said. “You can’t not deal with voice. It’s hands-free and can summarise a lot of things quickly.” Amazon appears to have impacted the sector the most with its connected speakers using Alexa. The service allows users a wide range of voice interactions for music, news, purchases and connects with smart home devices. “Alexa is the top dog,” Kay said. “Amazon has done the best work from a commercial perspective. They took it out of the theoretical to put it to work for things people want to do.” Samsung has also promoted Bixby as a remote hub for connected devices, which is another challenge as it takes the software beyond the smartphone. Patrick Moorhead, analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, said Bixby’s success in the connected home may depend on how much data it can collect. “Machine learning gets better the more training it gets and the more data it gets,” Moorhead said. While Bixby cannot benefit from the large databases of competitors Apple and Windows, it could potentially sync with Samsung electronics and smart home appliances through Samsung’s SmartThings platform. “Samsung ships so many devices from phones to Chromebooks to washing machines, it is picking up a different set of information, so it might end up being smarter than Siri,” he said. “Siri doesn’t know what’s in your refrigerator, Samsung does.” The app faces an uphill battle in a fragmented market where competing platforms don’t always work together. Moorhead said tech companies are jockeying for a position in order to “get access to data by using this interface they can build detailed profiles on you.” AFP Sunday Magazine sunday magazine aaj kal Business Plus TGIF Zaiqa TV Company Financials Investor Information Contact us Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions © 2017 DailyTimes - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Powered By opustech.co

Macs & Mac OS X | 28 Mar 2017 | Print  | Comment (10) iWork Updates Bring New and Returning Features by Michael E. Cohen Apple’s avalanche of updates on 27 March 2017 included new versions of its iWork apps — Pages, Keynote, and Numbers — for the Mac, iOS, and iCloud (see “iOS 10.3 Adds New File System, Find My AirPods, and More,” 27 March 2017 and “Apple Releases macOS 10.12.4, watchOS 3.2, and tvOS 10.2,” 27 March 2017 for detailed coverage of the avalanche). As with previous iWork updates, all the apps received some nearly identical new capabilities, while simultaneously acquiring individual refinements. Also, like the previous updates, the Mac apps gained the fullest set of new features, the iOS apps got a generous subset of those, and the iCloud apps were limited to a handful while still retaining compatibility with their more sophisticated siblings. And, of course, as has been the case for some time now, the latest versions of the Mac and iOS apps require the current version of the operating system on their respective platforms: macOS 10.12 for the Mac iWork apps and iOS 10 for the iOS iWork apps. iWork on the Mac -- The updated Mac apps — Pages 6.1, Numbers 4.1, and Keynote 7.1 — have these new features in common: Leader lines in pie charts A quick menu to replace fonts globally in a document Touch Bar support for opening password protected documents with Touch ID The capability to incorporate up-to-date stock values and currency prices in documents Options to customize dates, time, and currencies for languages or regions In addition, each app has its own set of special enhancements: Pages: Two features, missing since the transition from Pages ’09 to Pages 5.0, have finally returned: intra-document bookmarks and import and export of RTF documents. Hooray! (About time!) Keynote: The presentation app now provides an object list that provides quick access to each object on the current slide. A new low-light option for presenter notes has also been included to make it easier to read them when the room lights are low. Numbers: Apple’s spreadsheet has gained a “My Stocks” template that takes advantage of the new stock and securities capabilities to allow users to track their portfolios. You can also now cut, copy, add, and paste sheets in shared documents. To keep track of it all, you can consult the cumulative update notes on the Web for each of the Mac apps: Pages, Numbers, and Keynote. iWork in iOS -- The updated iOS apps include most of the new and enhanced capabilities of their Mac siblings, but with typical iOS flavor. Pages: The capability to see, add, and navigate to bookmarks works in iOS as well as the Mac, though how you access these features is different. You add bookmarks from the contextual menu that appears when you select something in a document, and you can view and navigate to bookmarks from a popover provided from the More menu (the three-dot icon on the document toolbar in Pages for iOS). Also new are font formatting features previously limited to the Mac app, such as superscripts and subscripts, ligature control, and background color for text. You can view the cumulative iOS update notes for Pages here. Numbers: You’ll appreciate much-improved formula and cell editing features, such as an optional popover with editing options when a cell is selected. The keyboard shortcut bar has acquired special shortcuts for formula editing, and the app now provides the capability to edit rich text in cells. Go here for the cumulative update notes for Numbers in iOS. Keynote: You can now change slide masters and customize the background with options on the formatting popover (the paintbrush icon on the toolbar), and the options for rehearsing your presentation can now show the slide, your notes, and the timer all in one view. And if you have some ancient presentations knocking about that you’d like to update, Keynote can now import Keynote 1 presentations. See the full list of enhancements for Keynote in iOS here. iWork in the Browser -- Keeping with tradition and the limitations of browser technology, the iWork updates available at icloud.com provide only a subset of the new features, and many of those on the other two platforms don’t make it to the browser. Nonetheless, documents edited in the browser apps remain fully compatible with the iOS and Mac apps. For example, though you can’t add or even view bookmarks in Pages for iCloud, any bookmarks you have added on, say, the Mac, are not harmed by editing the document in your browser (unless, of course, you delete the text that was bookmarked). Similarly, you can see existing leader lines for pie charts in the browser apps, even though you can’t create or edit them there. All the browser apps have had a user-interface facelift, and their toolbars are now color-coded to match the iOS color palettes for the iOS apps: orange for Pages, green for Numbers, and blue for Keynote. More interestingly, the toolbar of each browser app now has a button that you can click to open the current document in its native app on the Mac. This feature, however, is only half-implemented, because doing so does not close the document in the browser, which means you’ll see conflict warnings if you make changes with the Mac app without manually closing the document in the browser app first. Concluding Thoughts -- Apple has updated the iWork apps over the last several years at a leisurely pace, and the improvements that have arrived with each update have been modest. Nonetheless, this conservative approach has meant that the apps seem to remain stable and exhibit few interoperability conflicts across platforms. What’s more, while not completely restoring features lost when iWork ’09 was superseded (such as the much-mourned disappearance of linked text boxes in Pages), the current updates bring the apps closer in capability to their ancestors.   Create a website to showcase your work.

Cohen   2017-03-28 17:49 I haven't checked lately, but as of Pages 5.5, AppleScript support for mail merge was available. https://www.takecontrolbooks.com/blog/mail-merge-and-labels-in-pages Reply barefootguru   2017-03-29 00:17 Thanks for the article! The link for Numbers in iOS goes to Pages. Reply Michael E. Cohen   2017-03-29 01:12 You're welcome. And the link has been fixed. Thanks for letting us know. Reply John Baxter   2017-03-29 00:31 I don't see the macOS updates as updates on my El Capitan machines. And clicking Update in the Featured listing does not update (nor does it object...it just greys out the update button. That probably means these updates are Sierra (and later) only. Reply Michael E. Cohen   2017-03-29 01:18 Yes, that has been the case since Apple retooled iWork apps for cross-platform compatibility on Mac, iOS, and iCloud a few OS releases back: the latest versions of the iWork Mac apps require the latest version of macOS and won't install or run on earlier releases. Similarly, the iOS apps require the version of iOS that is current at their release. Reply juandesant  2017-03-29 06:37 I'd like to mention the new equation editing features using LaTeX and MathML, that are also present in iBooks Author. Reply Andreas Frick  2017-03-29 10:58 iWork 09 already lacked many features of AppleWorks 6 or 5. Hyphenation was much better. Still there is no database, no draw and noch paint program which can read AppleWorks files. I'm still waiting for an improved version of Pages 4.3 with better pdf export incl. bookmarks and better outliner. AppleWorks was a nice program suitable for most daily tasks. I can't understand, why there is no comprehensive successor. Reply David   2017-03-29 12:19 Because MS already owns that sector of the market, and Apple clearly decided not to try and recreate the monster that is Office. Reply Andreas Frick  2017-03-30 05:44 A true replacement for AppleWorks would be sufficient for me.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Rumor All Three iPhones Coming in September Are Rumored to Feature True Tone Displays – Here’s What That Means By Omar Sohail Mar 31, 2017 18Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple’s True Tone display is exclusively present in the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, but according to the claims of an analyst, it looks like the iPhone 8, iPhone 7s, and iPhone 7s Plus are going to ship with the same display. Here Is How the True Tone Displays Running on All Three iPhone 8 Models Will Function The feature that separated the 9.7-inch iPad Pro has been rumored to be found on all three iPhones, according to an analyst from Barclays. According to details obtained by MacRumors, the following has been stated about the new feature present in the upcoming mobile devices. Related Upcoming iPhone 8 Could Look a Lot Like the Galaxy S8 That’s Getting Announced Today “For the expected iPhone 7S models, as well as the iPhone 8, we think ams’s content increases due to the inclusion of its full spectral sensing ambient light sensor, as already seen in the iPad Pro for that device’s True Color screen functionality. We estimate this to be a material step-up in content from the $0.60 range to $1.00.” So if you want to know how this feature will work, let us provide you a little scenario so that you can understand better. Suppose if you are sitting in a room or surrounded in an environment that has little to no source of light, the ambient light sensors present in the iPhones will automatically adapt the color and intensity of the display to match the color temperature of the light in its surroundings, and this is going to take place whether you are using the device indoors or outdoors. Advertisement Using the phone in a dimly lit room will switch the display to appear warmer, or in other words, more yellowish. This will also aid to reduce eye strain if you are attempting to use the handset for a longer set of hours. It will definitely be interesting to see how the ‘OLED touting’ iPhone 8 sporting this feature will function. Related The iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus & iPhone 8 Will All Feature Wireless Charging; Apple Watch 3 Will Support LTE – Apple’s Supply Chain Reports OLED panels give off vibrant colors with a high contrast ratio, so we will see if the True Tone display helps to reduce eye strain for the user or not. What other benefits do you feel will emerge should all three iPhone models sport such a display? Let us know your thoughts down in the comments.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software iOS 10.3 Fixes Bug Causing iPhones To Call 911 Repeatedly By Ali Salman Mar 31, 2017 8Shares Share Tweet Submit Earlier this week, Apple had seen fit to release its next in line update, iOS 10.3 that brought quite a handful of new features to the table. While there were some serious forward facing features in the update, it also carried various bug fixes for a much smoother experience. Back in October of last year, it was first reported that iOS carried a bug that caused some iPhone models to call 911 emergency services repeatedly. Now, as reported by The Wall Street Journal, the issue has been resolved in iOS 10.3. Let’s dive in to see some more details on the subject and see if the update fixed any other issues prevailing in the firmware. iOS 10.3 Resolved An Issue That Allowed iPhones To Call 911 Emergency Services Repeatedly Previously, iOS was repeatedly calling 911 emergency services on some iPhones. The issue was discovered by an 18-year old who, in his finding, details that a Javascript can be used to force iOS devices into issuing pop-up alerts remotely. This allowed the devices to make calls and even open other apps as well. The person was later arrested for elaborating how serious the scenario was as he created a code that forced some iPhones to dial 911 repeatedly. Related SoundCloud For iOS Gains Support For Chromecast, Shared Playback And More As we have mentioned earlier, The Wall Street Journal has now reported that the iPhone-maker has resolved the issue in its mobile operating system in a new iOS 10.3 update. The update went live earlier this week, so if you haven’t updated to the latest iOS 10.3 firmware and are a victim of the issue, be sure to update your iPhone.   Advertisement “The code only triggered 911 calls from iPhones, exploiting a feature in the smartphone’s software that allows users to click on a phone number and immediately initiate a call. Apple says the update supersedes that capability and now requires users to always press a second confirmation before initiating a call.” Apple’s iOS 10.3 also introduced the company’s new Apple File System or APFS which has enhanced performance on older as well as new devices. The new file system on different iPhone models allows them to  boot up faster and also launch apps faster compared to iOS 10.2.1. If you’re interested in checking out more details, check out how iOS 10.3 stacks up against iOS 10.2.1 in a speed test comparison.

S. retail stores: Big, boring, expensive By BARRY RITHOLTZ Bloomberg This article was published April 2, 2017 at 1:51 a.m. Comments aAFont Size America is having a retail moment--and it's not a good one. It's easy to blame all of the industry's woes on the online giant Amazon. There's little doubt that the fifth-largest U.S. company by market cap has been disrupting traditional retailers. But online is far from the only source of retail's problems: The large chains, the malls they usually find themselves in, and even flagship urban stores have failed to adapt to rapidly changing consumer tastes. This lag has been readily apparent for more than a decade. Note that this is not the product of hindsight; during the financial crisis it was clear to me that retail shopping will emerge from the recession with a much smaller footprint than before. In 2010 I reiterated those views, observing that "the United States still has too large of a retail footprint--40 square feet of retail space for each person; that is the most per person in the world ... that needs to come down appreciably." My present views are even less optimistic. We are probably closer to the beginning of that transition than the end. This is a generational realignment in the way consumers spend their discretionary dollars, and the ramifications and economic dislocations are going to last for decades. This year alone there will be several thousand store closings. Hold aside for a moment the debacle that is Sears/Kmart--that has as much to do with complex financial engineering as anything else--and consider the ongoing changes in retail sales trends. Many factors are driving weakness in U.S. retailing: Too much retail. The United States has more retail square footage per capita than any other nation. By some measures we have six times the footage per person than the United Kingdom does. TAG Group's Dana Telsey describes many retailers as still "over-stored." The likely solution to this will be a combination of additional store location closings, further consolidation, and even more bankruptcies. Last summer, Macy's CEO Terry Lundgren called the situation "ridiculous," noting that the U.S. has 7.3 square feet of retail space per capita versus 1.7 square feet per capita in Japan and France. While the United States has more land and open space than those nations do, U.S. retail stores are over-concentrated in cities and suburbs. America's huge amounts of land in rural and exurban areas aren't what's driving this metric. The build cycle. One aspect of the over-stored issue is the mismatch between retail trends and the construction cycle. Trends change much faster than permits can be issued, buildings constructed and subsequently rented. That lag can be consequential. Look at the growth in big malls since the 1990s. Forbes notes that "since 1995, the number of shopping centers in the U.S. has grown by more than 23 percent and the total gross leasable area by almost 30 percent, while the population has grown by less than 14 percent." All of the retail construction reflected a very '90s shopping perspective, one that's considerably different today. It is more than just the rise of the Internet: Sport shopping, retail therapy, and conspicuous consumption offer less prestige today than they once did. Bor-ing! Shoppers are looking for more than just a place to shop. They want experiences more than just stuff. These changing consumer preferences reward some firms while punishing others. The wild success of the nearly 500 Apple stores provides lessons for other retailers. At $5,546 in sales per square foot, Apple sells more goods at retail than any other store in the world. The same exact products can be purchased at Best Buy, at Amazon, or even Apple's own website. Yet the company has hit upon a formula that sends more than 1 million visitors per day worldwide into Apple's retail locations with money to spend. (Surveys have shown that putting an Apple store in a mall increases sales 10 percent for all the other retailers.) Millennials shop differently. Retailers have an even bigger problem coming at them: the 20- and 30-somethings who make up the millennial generation. They have little affinity for cars, preferring to Uber wherever they go. So far, they have not been big buyers of homes (though that may change). We see this in mediocre durable goods numbers this decade. More than anything else, they value experiences over things. Mark-ups and pricing. One last issue: price. Thanks to "showrooming"--checking out stuff in stores only to buy online after finding out how much less it costs --consumers have learned how stiff mark-ups can be in retail. When customers believe they're overpaying, it does not lend itself to repeat business. There are some notable exceptions to the retail malaise, as specific firms such as Costco, Porsche, and Home Depot have done well. Outlet centers have been strong performers, as consumers still bargain-hunt. For every retail out-performer you can name, there are many more under-performers. Those warnings about excess retail space are almost a decade old. If anything, the existential threat to the consumer retail industries are even more acute today.

PHOTO: AFP WASHINGTON: Samsung’s Bixby is the new kid on the block of personal digital assistants and is likely to face a rough reception in a neighborhood dominated by tech sector rivals. Bixby — introduced at Samsung’s unveiling of Galaxy S8 smartphones — aims to help the South Korean giant break into a surging market for voice-activated virtual assistants, which includes Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant and Microsoft’s Cortana. The latest personal digital assistant distinguishes itself from competitors by using voice commands rather than touch to control handsets or applications, factoring in location awareness and image recognition. The integrated camera function allows users to identify buildings, such as popular tourist sites, to access their websites and other information simply by snapping a photo. The photo recognition technology can also help users decipher menus in foreign languages, or find places to shop for specific items they photograph. 5 features that make Galaxy S8 the next iPhone killer “It impressed me that they were doing image recognition and context awareness,” said Bob O’Donnell, analyst and consultant with Technalysis Research, who attended the presentation. “It adds some new twists we haven’t seen before,” he said, noting Bixby’s ability to make recommendations. Yet Bixby is still a work in progress — the virtual entity did not speak at the New York demonstration. It has yet to be infused with technology from Samsung’s recently acquired Viv, a company founded by creators of Apple’s Siri. “It’s not talking yet,” O’Donnell said. “They have room to expand and grow.” Bixby will face competition from established players — even from Samsung’s own phones, where users can choose to use Assistant, Cortana or Alexa. Richard Windsor, an independent analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog, said Bixby may face problems because the “best-in-class Google Assistant” will be on the home button of the new phone, which is powered by Google-backed Android software. That means Bixby has a “fearsome competitor” on its own flagship device, according to the analyst. “Bixby is trying to do things a little differently but careful assessment of what Samsung demonstrated shows a service that has very little intelligence at all,” Windsor said. Samsung announces Bixby ahead of the Galaxy S8’s unveiling Roger Kay of Endpoint Technologies Associates said Bixby might face challenges catching up with its rivals, which have been deployed for some time. “You can’t build these things overnight,” Kay said. “It would take years to create something as developed as Siri.” Still, he noted, it is important for Samsung to be in the game. “These are table stakes,” Kay said. “You can’t not deal with voice. It’s hands-free and can summarize a lot of things quickly.” Amazon appears to have impacted the sector the most with its connected speakers using Alexa. The service allows users a wide range of voice interactions for music, news, purchases and connects with smart home devices. “Alexa is the top dog,” Kay said. “Amazon has done the best work from a commercial perspective. They took it out of the theoretical to put it to work for things people want to do.” Samsung has also promoted Bixby as a remote hub for connected devices, which is another challenge as it takes the software beyond the smartphone. Samsung unveils new flagship smartphone Galaxy S8 Patrick Moorhead, analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, said Bixby’s success in the connected home may depend on how much data it can collect. “Machine learning gets better the more training it gets and the more data it gets,” Moorhead said. While Bixby cannot benefit from the large databases of competitors Apple and Windows, it could potentially sync with Samsung electronics and smart home appliances through Samsung’s SmartThings platform. “Samsung ships so many devices from phones to Chromebooks to washing machines, it is picking up a different set of information, so it might end up being smarter than Siri,” he said. “Siri doesn’t know what’s in your refrigerator, Samsung does.” The app faces an uphill battle in a fragmented market where competing platforms don’t always work together. Moorhead said tech companies are jockeying for a position in order to “get access to data — by using this interface they can build detailed profiles on you.” Read more: Artificial Intelligence , Bixby , Samsung Read full story Recommended Stories Google, Amazon eye Toshiba's chip unit: report Toshiba has reportedly completed the first round of bidding for its prized memory chip business Trump has finally replaced his 'unsecure' android device Trump's decision to transition from his Android device is positive for security, but still a target for hackers Samsung store catches fire day before Galaxy S8 launch A fire broke out at the storeroom of Samsung Experience Store in AMK Hub Samsung plans to sell refurbished Galaxy Note 7s Company also plans to recover and use or sell reusable components such as chips and camera modules Facebook Conversations Leave Your Reply Below Click here to cancel reply.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ hands-on: Samsung finally out-designed Apple’s iPhone Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Zach Epstein @zacharye March 29th, 2017 at 11:00 AM Share Tweet After months of countless leaks and rumors, it was starting to feel like this day might never actually come. Believe it or not, however, it’s finally here: Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are finally official. No more specs leaks, no more renders, no more spy shots on Weibo, no more dummy models being compared to rival smartphones, and no more guessing. Samsung on Wednesday finally took the wraps off of its next-generation Galaxy S flagship phones. We spent some time with the new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ earlier this week, and there’s really only one thing you have to know: You don’t know anything about these phones. You’ve seen all the leaks and you’ve read all the rumors, but nothing you’ll ever see on a computer screen or a smartphone display can properly convey just how stunning Samsung’s new flagship phones truly are. Don't Miss: Trump’s Android phone has been repealed and replaced Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR We’ve obviously got plenty of Galaxy S8 coverage lined up for you today, but in this post I’m going to focus on one thing in particular: Samsung’s design. First, let’s quickly run through the specs. Aside from the displays (5.8-inch QHD+ Super AMOLED vs. 6.2-inch QHD+ Super AMOLED), the batteries (3,000 mAh vs. 3,500 mAh), and the overall size, the new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are identical. Both phones are powered by the new 10nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset in the US, while the global models pack Samsung’s own Exynos 8895 SoC. Both phones also pack 4GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage, microSDXC support, a 12-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, IP68 water- and dust-resistance, and Android Nougat. Both phones also share what is unquestionably the most stunning smartphone design of all time. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are an evolution of the design we’ve seen on other recent Samsung phones like the Galaxy S7 edge and the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7. The similarities are obvious, but the S8 and S8+ look and feel brand new in the hand. Samsung removed the oblong home button on the face of the phones and reworked the phone’s guts, which allowed the company to design two smartphones with displays that occupy a staggering 83% of the phones’ faces. The look is incredible. While it will still be quite some time before any company launches the all-screen smartphone we’ve all been waiting for, Samsung’s Galaxy S8 is as close as any mass-market device has come. Because the narrow bezels that remain are a deep, glossy black that matches the display itself, distractions seem to fade away and content takes center stage more so than on any other phone. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Like the S7 edge and Note 7, the sides of the phone are curved on both the front of the phone and on the back. As a result, the Galaxy S8 feels impossibly thin. I was really looking forward to using a phone with a nice big 5.8-inch screen crammed into a handset that is barely bigger than the iPhone 7, but I might actually prefer the larger Galaxy S8+ to the smaller model. It’s unbelievably comfortable in your hand thanks to the curved edges. Even though the phone is about the same size as the iPhone 7 Plus, it feels much smaller. Of note, there is a new virtual home button that appears on the bottom of the display where the old physical home button used to be, and Samsung has included its own take on Apple’s 3D Touch haptic feedback that offers localized vibration feedback when you press the button. For those wondering, it’s not even in the same league as Apple’s solution. It does the trick in that you feel some feedback when you tap the home button, but it’s nothing like Apple’s Taptic engine. When you press the virtual home button on the iPhone 7, it feels like you’re clicking a real button. When you press the virtual home button on the Galaxy S8, it feels like the phone is vibrating.

Here’s another shot without the iPhone in the image: Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR As you can see, the Galaxy S8 and LG G6 are about the same size, though the Samsung phone is far more comfortable in the hand thanks to LG’s peculiar design snafu that I wrote about recently. Both phones feel like the future, though. Smartphone design had become stagnant in the past few years, but this new leap toward all-screen phones brings some much-needed freshness to the market. There’s plenty more to cover, of course, and we have much more Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ coverage lined up for you today. We’ll dive into the phones’ software and performance much more in that coverage, but there are a few things I wanted to touch on briefly in this post. First, Samsung’s new Desktop Experience is flat-out awesome. Either phone can be connected to Samsung’s new DeX dock to instantly power an Android desktop experience alongside a connected monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Several of Samsung’s apps like the browser and email app have been optimized for the new Desktop Experience, though every first- and third-party app on the phone can be used in desktop mode. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR I haven’t spent time diving in yet, of course, but so far I’m very impressed. The experience is lightning-fast (apps open so much faster than they do on my MacBook that it’s a little depressing, to be honest) and it’s great for multitasking. I could easily see Samsung’s Desktop Experience replacing the need for a PC or Chromebook for many users, especially if some big-name third-party developers get on board and optimize their apps. Microsoft has already done so with its Office suite, in fact, and more announcements should come soon. In fact, Samsung even partnered with VMWare, Citrix, and Amazon to enable all three popular Windows 10 virtual desktop experiences on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. In other words, if you want, you can use your new Android phone as a Windows 10 desktop. Image Source: Zach Epstein, BGR Bixby seems like it will be another highlight, though I haven’t yet spent much time testing it. Samsung’s answer to Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant can be called upon with a voice command or by holding down the dedicated Bixby button on the left edge of the phone, and it will support a very wide set of features at launch. In terms of core functionality, Samsung said anything that can be done with a touch in any app can also be done with your voice using Bixby. The new virtual assistant is also context-aware, and a nifty feature called Bixby Vision brings the camera into play. Bixby Vision can recognize objects or points of interest and give the user info, and it can also recognize text and translate more than 50 languages in real-time. If Bixby isn’t your speed though, don’t worry — Samsung also included Google Assistant in the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. Simply press and hold the home button to pull up Assistant, just like you would on any other Android Nougat device that ships with Google Assistant. Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will be released on April 21st, and preorders open tomorrow, March 30th, at 12:01AM from all major US carriers. The phone will be available in black, gray and silver in the US, and preorders will include a free next-generation Gear VR headset with Samsung’s new wireless remote and a free Oculus game pack.

Related Samsung launches Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus with voice-assistant tech Bixby Move over, Siri! Bixby voice-assistant to debut with Samsung Galaxy S8 smartphone WASHINGTON: Samsung's Bixby is the new kid on the block of personal digital assistants and is likely to face a rough reception in a neighborhood dominated by tech sector rivals. Bixby -- introduced at Samsung's unveiling of Galaxy S8 smartphones -- aims to help the South Korean giant break into a surging market for voice-activated virtual assistants, which includes Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana. The latest personal digital assistant distinguishes itself from competitors by using voice commands rather than touch to control handsets or applications, factoring in location awareness and image recognition. The integrated camera function allows users to identify buildings, such as popular tourist sites, to access their websites and other information simply by snapping a photo. The photo recognition technology can also help users decipher menus in foreign languages, or find places to shop for specific items they photograph. "It impressed me that they were doing image recognition and context awareness," said Bob O'Donnell, analyst and consultant with Technalysis Research, who attended the presentation. "It adds some new twists we haven't seen before," he said, noting Bixby's ability to make recommendations. Yet Bixby is still a work in progress -- the virtual entity did not speak at the New York demonstration. It has yet to be infused with technology from Samsung's recently acquired Viv, a company founded by creators of Apple's Siri. "It's not talking yet," O'Donnell said. "They have room to expand and grow." Bixby will face competition from established players -- even from Samsung's own phones, where users can choose to use Assistant, Cortana or Alexa. Richard Windsor, an independent analyst who writes the Radio Free Mobile blog, said Bixby may face problems because the "best-in-class Google Assistant" will be on the home button of the new phone, which is powered by Google-backed Android software. That means Bixby has a "fearsome competitor" on its own flagship device, according to the analyst. "Bixby is trying to do things a little differently but careful assessment of what Samsung demonstrated shows a service that has very little intelligence at all," Windsor said. Roger Kay of Endpoint Technologies Associates said Bixby might face challenges catching up with its rivals, which have been deployed for some time. "You can't build these things overnight," Kay said. "It would take years to create something as developed as Siri." Still, he noted, it is important for Samsung to be in the game. "These are table stakes," Kay said. "You can't not deal with voice. It's hands-free and can summarize a lot of things quickly." Amazon appears to have impacted the sector the most with its connected speakers using Alexa. The service allows users a wide range of voice interactions for music, news, purchases and connects with smart home devices. "Alexa is the top dog," Kay said. "Amazon has done the best work from a commercial perspective. They took it out of the theoretical to put it to work for things people want to do." Want stories like this in your inbox?

South Korean Ex-President Park Arrested Home » Falcon 9: SpaceX makes history with relaunch of a rocket Falcon 9: SpaceX makes history with relaunch of a rocket Sun, 2017-04-02 09:14  editor United Kingdom Hemantha Abeywardena writes from London… The launch of Samsung Galaxy S8 somewhat disappointed those who recently became Samsung converts, in search of a credible alternative to Apple’s iPhone, while watching the event live online: the changes were just evolutionary; it is neither revolutionary nor a game changer. It goes without saying that the absence of a revolutionary leap in the smartphone industry is directly related to the absence of visionaries at the helm of biggest players in the sector. In short, we can only dream that a man of late Steve Jobs calibre would appear out of the blue, in the form of a digital messiah, in order to change the stagnating technological sector beyond recognition. Against this backdrop, the bold step taken by a great visionary of our time, in an equally significant realm, is both commendable and a breath of fresh air. Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX , could hardly hide his excitement during a press conference after the successful relaunch of Falcon-9 rocket from the Kennedy Space Centre – KSC – on Thursday. Not only did his team successfully relaunch the rocket, but also managed to put a commercial satellite into orbit and bring the rocket back to the Earth, while erecting yet another milestone in space travel. Falcon 9 has been in space before: it carried cargo for the astronauts stationed in the ISS – International Space Station – in April, last year. Once the mission was accomplished, it managed to land on a robotic ship in the Atlantic Ocean, maintained by SpaceX, the private space exploration company owned by Mr Musk, a co-founder of PayPal. Rockets, once sent into space, are usually substantially damaged; the only alternative in these circumstances is to invest millions of dollars to make a new rocket – a serious challenge to a private company, when the return of investment hinges on a series of factors beyond the control of the technical team that include being at the mercy of gravity. Mr Musk has been contemplating on the reuse of rockets for some time; his optimism sees no bounds: “The cost of space travel could be reduced by a factor of a hundred,” he once said in his own blog. History has always been awash with doubters, when bold, risk-taking men with come-what-may attitude tried to make a breakthrough. The ridicules and mild insults aimed at Mr Musk were no exception. With the remarkable achievement, Elon Musk proved how the magical combination of vision, determination and assembling the right technical team is much more worthwhile than wasting time and energy on silencing or taking on the critics on PR front. The cost of launch of Falcon 9, according to SpaceX website, is $62 million. Of course, a part of the cost may have paid by the company that owns the satellite that was put into orbit. SpaceX has been trying to bring its rockets back to the Earth for a few years with the probability of success standing at 8 out of 13; so, odds are fairly in his Mr Musk’s favour. Elon Musk is not the only man who is trying to conquer space with daring innovating steps. Jeff Bezos, the founder of online giant, Amazon, is also in space race with endless experiments with new form of rockets. It’s not clear whether the two men see eye to eye on the relaunch of rockets. They, however, have one thing in common; both defied critics when the latter thought their innovative ideas would never move beyond their respective imaginations. If the relaunch of the rockets are as successful as Mr Musk anticipates, they will in turn certainly bring the cost of putting satellites into orbits down substantially, which could potentially bring in countless benefits to mankind. - Asian Tribune- Tweet Login or register to post comments News Headlines 1,750 Sri Lankan expats granted dual citizenship Rajiv Gandhi assassination case A G Perarivalan, files second petition , seeking explanation on actor Sanjay Dutt’s, early release Trump White House: Insensitive to Human Rights Concern Time to rethink our nuclear arsenal policy Falcon 9: SpaceX makes history with relaunch of a rocket Lyca, send legal notice to regional party head for defamatory comments India’s linguistic imperialism: Tamil Nadu resents central imposition of Hindi on them!

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > New version of Google Calendar makes the most of… New version of Google Calendar makes the most of the iPad's larger screen By Kyle Wiggers — March 29, 2017 1:06 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you If you've been holding out for an iPad-optimized version of Google Calendar, we've got some good news: It's finally here. Better late than never. On Wednesday, Google launched a new version of Google Calendar, its popular web-based planner, for Apple’s iPad. It’s basically like the Google Calendar app for iPhone, but optimized for the iPad’s larger screen. Bigger icons make dragging and dropping calendar appointments a little easier, and enlarged text simplifies the process of adding new appointments. More: Your fitness goals from Google Fit and Apple Health now show up in Google Calendar It’s a little more intuitive, too, than the built-in Calendar app for iOS — especially when it comes to syncing Google Calendars. Normally, syncing multiple Google Calendars requires supplying your Google Credentials to Apple’s Calendar settings, signing into your Google account, and checking the individual boxes beside the calendars you want to sync with your device. With the new Google Calendar for iOS, you only have to sign in once. Otherwise, the new Google Calendar for iPad boasts all of Calendar’s existing features. One of those is Smart Scheduling, which suggests meeting times and available rooms based on participant’s availability and room preferences. Goals, meanwhile, intelligently schedules goals that you want to achieve in the upcoming weeks and months — if you set a goal to go running at 6:30 a.m. every other morning but don’t actually start running until 7:15 a.m., Google will reschedule future events automatically. More: Learn to keep your calendar organized with our best Google-Fu The new Calendar app is built into iOS Spotlight search — you can search for appointments and meetings from the iPad’s home screen. And it ships with a new Today View Widget that shows upcoming events in Notification Center (and in the future, on the lock screen). The release of Calendar for iPad comes on the heels of fitness app integration. In January, Google linked Apple’s Health app and Google’s own Fit to Google Calendar. Fitness goals you’ve scheduled in either show up in Google Calendar, and once you accomplish them, marks the events as done. More: How to sync multiple Google Calendars with your iOS device In April, Google Calendar gained support for reminders on desktop. When you set a reminder with apps like Inbox by Gmail, Google Keep, Google Now, and through the Google Calendar app, it will sync with the web client. Unlike calendar entries, reminders are present until they’re complete, and appear at the top of your calendar each day.
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Google's updated Search app comes with… Google's updated Search app comes with Gboard, Google's third-party keyboard By Kyle Wiggers — March 29, 2017 2:04 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you The new Google Search app with Gboard makes it easier to find emoji, GIFs, and more. Android may be Google’s operating system, but that doesn’t mean the search giant’s ignoring its second-largest market: Apple’s iOS. This week, Google rolled out a string of updates to one of its most popular iPhone products: Search. Starting this week, the Google Search app for iOS now includes Google’s third-party Gboard as part of its download — you will see the option to enable Gboard in the Google app’s settings. More: Google updates iPhone Search app with a smarter Google Now and customized alerts Gboard, Google’s third-party keyboard for iOS, already boasts an impressive number of features. The headlining feature is a built-in Google Search bar that lets you send weather forecasts, videos, images, news, restaurant recommendations, emojis, GIFs, and anything else Google’s servers manage to find. Gboard’s support for glide typing lets you compose replies by swiping a finger across the keyboard (a faster alternative to tapping out the letters individually). And voice transcription’s on board, too. The new Search app for iOS also boasts “Trending on Google,” a widget that features breaking news and other topics based on trending searches across Google. Tapping on an item launches the Google app, so you can read more. Apple’s 3D Touch features heavily in the new update. A 3D Touch on the Search app’s icon surfaces up options to start a voice, image, or incognito search, and a tap on the ‘G’ icon at the bottom of the screen quickly starts a new search. A 3D Touch on the search results themselves, meanwhile, shows a preview of the content in question. More: The new and improved Google app makes it easier to keep track of recommendations, reminders, and interests The new widget’s easy to add. Tapping on the Edit button from the button of the Notification Center brings it up, as does a 3D Touch. Increasingly, Google’s Search app is becoming a one-stop shop for the search giant’s services. Two years ago, Google rolled out an update that added conversational voice. Basically, it put voice questions in context — asking, “What’s the weather like?” and immediately following up with, “How about this weekend?” will show results tailored to the second query. Last year, Google rolled out a streamlined Search app that broke results into two categories: Current Topics and Upcoming Events. News, sports, weather, and other topics populated the former and info about calendar appointments and important emails took up the latter.
Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Android apps could rake in more cash than iOS this… Android apps could rake in more cash than iOS this year — but there’s a catch By Adam Ismail — March 29, 2017 2:22 PM Subscribe Share bloomua/123RF Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you With higher revenue numbers, Android could attract even more developer support, potentially leading to higher quality apps and more innovation on the platform. This year is slated to be a pivotal one for app sales, according to a report from App Annie. The analytics firm projects Android app revenue to overtake that of iOS for the first time ever by the end of 2017 — but there’s a catch. Apple’s App Store should pull in $40 billion, by App Annie’s estimation. This would make for an increase of $6 billion over last year’s numbers. Google Play, on its own, is expected to deliver a little more than half that in 2017 — $21 billion. So where’s the other $20 billion coming from? More: Google Play celebrates anniversary with lists of its most popular apps App Annie If you combine Google Play’s revenue with that of other Android app stores, like Amazon’s, Samsung’s, and SlideMe, app spend on the platform could overtake iOS by roughly $1 billion, the report claims. While Google on its own may narrow the gap to Apple over the next five years — App Annie says by 2021, Google could be earning somewhere around $42 billion a year, compared to Apple’s $60 billion — the company will likely continue to lose significant sales to third-party marketplaces for the foreseeable future. What makes Apple’s performance especially impressive is that the company managed less than half the app downloads Google achieved last year — 29 billion to 63 billion, respectively — and still raked in double the sales. App Annie attributes this to Apple’s relatively more affluent customers, but Android could somewhat compensate for this with its more dominant market share worldwide and rapidly growing install base in emerging markets like India, Brazil, and Indonesia. Such markets are expected to play a major role in the growth of the app economy — particularly China, which is beginning to mature. The country far and away leads the rest of the world in terms of downloads, but App Annie sees this trend slowing in the next few years. At the same time, revenue from Chinese users may actually increase. The report predicts China could eventually account for as much as 41 percent of worldwide app spending by 2021.

Bixby — introduced at Samsung’s unveiling of Galaxy S8 smartphones — aims to help the South Korean giant break into a surging market for voice-activated virtual assistants, which includes Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant and Microsoft’s Cortana. The latest personal digital assistant distinguishes itself from competitors by using voice commands rather than touch to control handsets or applications, factoring in location awareness and image recognition.

They took it out of the theoretical to put it to work for things people want to do.” Beyond the phone Samsung has also promoted Bixby as a remote hub for connected devices, which is another challenge as it takes the software beyond the smartphone. Patrick Moorhead, analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, said Bixby’s success in the connected home may depend on how much data it can collect. “Machine learning gets better the more training it gets and the more data it gets,” Moorhead said. While Bixby cannot benefit from the large databases of competitors Apple and Windows, it could potentially sync with Samsung electronics and smart home appliances through Samsung’s SmartThings platform. “Samsung ships so many devices from phones to Chromebooks to washing machines, it is picking up a different set of information, so it might end up being smarter than Siri,” he said. “Siri doesn’t know what’s in your refrigerator, Samsung does.” The app faces an uphill battle in a fragmented market where competing platforms don’t always work together.

The flaw was discovered by an 18-year old who found a way to use Javascript to remotely cause iOS devices to open popup alerts, open apps, and make phone calls. In an effort to show the severity of the problem, he created a code that caused iPhones to dial 911 repeatedly. All in all, he ended up being arrested and charged with four counts of computer tampering after causing thousands of accidental 911 calls. It appears that Apple has worked with app developers to examine the issue and close the loophole. The code only triggered 911 calls from iPhones, which exploited a feature in the underlying software that allows users to tap on a phone number and immediately initiate a call. Apple says the update supersedes that capability and now requires users to always press a second confirmation before initiating a call. The issue follows a report issued earlier this month in which cybersecurity experts pointed out a vulnerability in which a 911 call center could be in “immediate danger” of losing service due to an overwhelming volume of calls. iOS 10.3 was released earlier this week and includes a host of new features, both user-facing ones as well as a variety of security fixes. Apple had originally said that it was working to fix this 911 exploit, but now that it’s officially available as part of iOS 10.3, that’s all the more reason to update. Apple also started beta testing iOS 10.3.2 this week, leading credence to speculation that iOS 10.3.1 is right around the corner. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Candidates vow to break record: 'Man About Town' nominees are raising funds for Phoenix Foundation Saturday Apr 1, 2017 at 6:47 PM Apr 1, 2017 at 6:49 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — The High Desert Phoenix Foundation kicked off its annual Man About Town fundraiser with a special ‘50s theme celebration. Dressed in leather jackets, white T-shirts and sunglasses, a group of nominees who are competing for the honorable title of Man About Town gathered for the fifth annual kick off event at Los Domingos Mexican restaurant on Friday. Julie Norton, the nonprofit’s co-founder, told the Daily Press nine men will try to beat last year’s “record setting amount of $30,162” for the foundation that helps families in the High Desert who have lost loved ones as a result of an accident or a crime. This year’s Man About Town candidates will attempt to win the crown by trying to win $1 votes during the voting period that ends April 20. This year’s candidates include High Tech Lending Mortgage loan originator Brad Smith, C.A.R.S. body shop owner Carlos Sarmiento, Little Caesars franchise owner Pat Orr, Apple Valley Communications president Gabe Lovato, Kona Ice co-owner Tony Colver, Arch Angel Financial CEO Chris Martin, co-owner Thompson Family Plumbing and Rooter John Thompson, Q Marketing owner Sergio Quesada, and Realtor/sales representative Dave McConnell. Kick off master of ceremonies Chris Ackerman announced to supporters gathered at the restaurant that the group has vowed to raise $40,000 for the foundation this year. “I’m voting for all of them because they’re all my friends,” said business owner Dana Hernandez, as the group enjoyed food and conversation at the eatery. Wearing his gold crown, former Man About Town winner Thurston “Smitty” Smith said winning crown is about “bragging rights,” but the money raised goes toward a worthy cause. Some of the candidates have already scheduled fundraisers such as a “Gabe Roast” for Lovato, a “Cadillac Ranch BBQ/Carwash” and “Carlos’ Family Feud Night” for Sarmiento, a “Taco Tuesday Fundraiser” for Thompson and a Little Caesars’ pizza special. These events can be found by searching Facebook. Business leader Jeff Patterson took home the crown last year, with Victorville City Manager Doug Robertson finishing second and Hesperia Mayor Pro Temp Russ Blewett rounded out the top three. “I feel honored that I was the one who raised the most amount of money,” Patterson told the Daily Press, last year. “I definitely believe in this organization and I’m grateful to be involved in such a worthy cause in helping the High Desert.” Votes can be cast through noon on April 20. A grand finale and coronation of the Man About Town winner will be held at 6 p.m. on April 22 at Sunset Hills Memorial Park located at 24000 Waalew Rd. in Apple Valley. The event will include refreshments, prizes and music by the Alley Cats. Online voting, candidate bios and general information can be found online at www.hdphoenixfoundation.com. Votes can also be sent by mailing a check or money order in the foundation’s name to P.O Box 803 Apple Valley, CA 92307. Please include the candidate’s name on the check’s memo line. Checks must be received by April 20. For more information, call 760-247-2290. Rene Ray De La Cruz may be reached at 760-951-6227, RDeLa Cruz@VVDailyPress.com or on Twitter @DP_ReneDeLaCruz.

According to a khaleejtimes.com report, citing Arabic daily Emarat Al Youm, the UAE’s Ministry of Economy stated that only specific iPhone 6s which contain defective batteries made in China during September and October 2015 will be recalled. Apple has recently expressed that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. If you have experienced this issue, the firm has urged residents to use the serial number checker (www.apple.com/ae/support/iPhone6s-unexpectedshutdown/) if your iPhone 6s is eligible for a battery replacement, free of charge.

Say I’m dreaming about getting to the airport, or finding the room with the final exam I haven’t studied for. When an alarm goes off, I snooze it: I am on a very important mission and cannot be interrupted. That is why I need this evil, terrible alarm clock app. The Laziest, Cheapest Way to Circumvent Your Snooping ISP Congress decided that your ISP should be allowed to sell off your private browsing data, but the solutions to get around this are a bit complicated, costly, or just a pain. What’s a lazy-internet person to do? Use Opera. iOS 10.3 Introduces a New File System, Adds In-App Reviews, and Find My AirPods Apple’s released iOS 10.3 today, which isn’t a particularly interesting update, but it does have a few minor improvements, including a new file system, that are worth mentioning. Night Shift, Apple’s Automatic Screen Dimming Software, Is Now Available For Your Mac If you’re a fan of Night Shift on your iPhone, or F.lux on your Mac, you’ll be happy to know that Apple’s rolling out an update to macOS today that adds the time-based color-shifting feature to your Mac. This App Sends Your Message to Your Congressperson’s Voicemail—And Also to The Entire World If you’re having trouble getting calls through to your member of Congress, an app called Stance says it can help.

How to Anonymize Your Browsing with a Tor-Powered Raspberry Pi Hotspot If you’ve been thinking about trying out Tor to anonymize all your web browsing, you could just download a browser and give that a spin, but it’s much more fun to make your own highly portable proxy that you can easily connect to on a whim.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BOTS Guest How your voice will help you understand data analytics Hira Saeed@heerasaeed April 1, 2017 4:41 PM Tags: ai, bots, chatbots, data analytics, machine learning, voicebots Above: Amazon Echo Image Credit: Carlos Delgado By Christmas 2016, Amazon’s Alexa was in 4 percent of American homes. Apple’s Siri handles more than 2 billion voice queries each week. And approximately 20 percent of Google search queries on Android devices are executed by voice. Increasing adoption of voice interfaces like these point to a fundamental shift in how we interact with our devices. In the span of just a few years, we’ve gone from the tyranny of the wired desktop mouse to mobile’s portable touchscreens. In workplaces, we have shifted from manual record-keeping to voice-enabled automated time and attendance management. Not only this, we have also shifted customer relationship officers to the conversational command prompts of chatbots. Now it seems that we’re transitioning again, this time to conversational interfaces synced to the services and data we use. With the growth of productivity platforms such as Slack, chatbots are especially well-positioned to become common voice interfaces, particularly in the enterprise space. This is great news for people who rely on complex data to do their jobs. Easier access to the services that enable business has led to an explosion in the amount of data flowing from these interactions.This, in turn, fuels a growing demand for more efficient ways to collate, process, analyze, and access that data. The answer, increasingly, is not to be found in apps at all, but rather in emerging voice interfaces and chatbots that are fast becoming strong business intelligence allies. Apps as redundant intermediaries “The product is no longer just an ‘app’ or a ‘website’,” wrote Betaworks’ Matthew Hartman in a recent column. “It’s the brain behind many different instantiations.” Thanks to the rise of APIs and embeddable components, a new generation of technology companies are developing solutions that provide functionality and information access and are platform-agnostic. Instead of being required to operate in one siloed environment, today’s users have access to a variety of data sources and back-end services that, in many cases, we’re not even aware of. Speech recognition and machine learning interpret plain language queries and deliver results in a variety of formats. In the past, if you wanted to access complex data analytics in order to make informed decisions, you had to use a variety of services and collate disparate datasets. This process was simplified somewhat with a range of dashboard products that imported this data and delivered a consolidated, visual perspective on your data. Moving into a post-app world The next evolutionary step is to leverage machine learning and natural language processing to enable professionals to query these data analytics services by voice or through conversations with chatbots. Services such as Sisense Everywhere, meanwhile, have integrated their complex data analytics engines with Amazon’s Alexa and Slack, using Sisense’s BI bot framework. The benefits of this approach include being able to request specific data points using a variety of interface options without needing to scroll through various screens and reports. Demand for platform-agnostic BI is high, with 51 percent of respondents to a recent Sisense study indicating that they’re interested in accessing analytics via voice-activated virtual assistants. In addition, 47 percent were interested in accessing data via productivity tools, and 12 percent via augmented reality. There is, of course, a big difference between using voice commands to query data and relying on a completely non-visual environment. “Via voice you’re going to get a very thin interaction,” Steve Wilson, Citrix’s VP of core infrastructure, recently told MIT Technology Review. “If you want to go in-depth, you’ll have to look at a screen.” Users have a tremendous amount of choice when it comes to apps. Each of the major app stores offers literally millions of products. And yet, according to ComScore’s 2016 US Mobile App Report, nearly half of all users download zero apps in any given month. To make matters worse, app market share is dominated by Facebook and Google, which, between them, account for almost 70 percent of app usage. This leaves a minuscule market share for all other developers to compete over. The apps that will thrive are those that deliver the most convenient interfaces to the data services that users already favor. Hello, data As voice interfaces and chatbots deliver access to a growing array of data-rich services, apps, and even screens, will become less dominant. These trends will become commonplace in the business environment, too. The proliferation of data that businesses increasingly rely on to make decisions will necessitate more efficient and smarter interfaces to distill useful data points to inform these decisions. You could be talking to your data sooner than you thought. Hira Saeed writes about AI, chatbots and Big Data. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

Himax will provide the glass component design, featuring chip-on-glass (COG) technology, which will fit into Lumentum’s 3D-sensing module for the iPhone 8. The front-facing camera will have a VCSEL (vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser)-based DOE (diffractive optical elements) that will support both 3D-sensing and 3D-modeling capabilities. Thus, the iPhone 8’s cameras might beat the Galaxy S8 when it comes to 3D capabilities that can enable augmented (AR) and virtual reality (VR) features in apps, while also offering better security. One of the obvious uses for 3D cameras in a phone is AR and VR, with recent reports claiming that Apple is more interested in the former. Furthermore, a front-facing camera with 3D-sensing powers would also be able to offer secure unlocks based on face recognition. By scanning the depth of field, such a system would be less prone to photo hacks, such as is the case with the Galaxy S8. Samsung’s new flagship phone also supports face unlocking, but the facial recognition software can be hacked with just an image. Samsung knows this, and that’s why it won’t let users use this security feature for Samsung Pay payments.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones HMD Global's Nokia 9 key specification leaked; tipped to boast 3D OZO Audio, Iris scanner, Carl Zeiss lens and more Leaked specifications hint that HMD Global's Nokia 9 will be a formidable rival to compete with Samsung Galaxy Note8, the Galaxy X and also Apple's iPhone X. Rohit KVN   April 3, 2017 11:02 IST [Representational Image] HMD Global’s Nokia 9 key specification leaked; tipped to boast 3D OZO Audio, Iris scanner, Carl Zeiss lens and more In Picture: Nokia 6IBTimes India/Sami Khan HMD Global Oy, the official licensee of Nokia brand, was rumoured launch flagship Nokia 9 with mid-tier Nokia 6, 5 and 3 series, but it never materialized. Now, key features of the Nokia 9 have surfaced online evoking excitement among fans. The upcoming Nokia 9 is said to house biometric technology-based Iris scanner in the, similar to the recently launched Samsung Galaxy S8 series, Nokia Power User (NPU) reported citing sources. Further, HMD Global Oy is also said to use Nokia OZO Audio system, which promises 3D audio experience on headphones and optimized spatial audio playback on Nokia 9. This also indicates the phone will come with special hardware with three mics for 3D audio recording while shooting videos and support VR (Virtual Reality) head gear for games and videos. Another notable feature of the Nokia 9 is that it will come with Carl Zeiss-based 22MP dual-lens primary camera on the back and an equally impressive 12MP front snapper with FFC (Flat-Field Correction) system, which helps in capturing high quality in digital images. With FCC, the distortion in 2-D images that are caused by variations in the pixel-to-pixel sensitivity of the detector or by distortions in the optical path can be removed. Other expected features of Nokia 9 include 5.5-inch QHD (1560x1440p) OLED screen with IP68 water-and-dust resistant certification, fingerprint sensor, Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 octa-core CPU, Android 7.1.2 Nougat OS, 6GB RAM, 64GB/128GB storage, a 3,800mAh with Qualcomm Quick Charging 4.0 technology. All the aforementioned details of the Nokia 9 do seem practical for a flagship, considering the fact that the device is slated to make its debut in coming months and have to directly compete with Samsung Galaxy Note8 (& also Galaxy X) and Apple's anniversary mobile – iPhone X (aka iPhone 8).

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Monday April 3, 2017 Sport Local Sport Larger / SmallerNight Mode Gold Cup field strongest in recent memory: Pilossof 3 Apr 2017, 2:13 p.m. Towac Park will welcome a host of gun gallopers this week. A SHOT: After running third in the prelude race, Hirokin (No.2) looks a real chance to claim this week's Orange Gold Cup at Towac Park. Photo: MATT FINDLAY If you ask Racing Orange executive officer Gav Pilossof, Friday’s Orange Gold Cup meeting is set to be one of the best days of racing Towac Park has seen in “quite some time”. He explained there’s almost $300,000 in prize-money up for grabs, with the obvious highlight being the $65,000 Craig Jaques Surveyors Orange Gold Cup (2100m) – Racing Orange’s marquee event each year. “(We also have) the Steeline Cup Day Sprint (1000m) and the CSR Lightweight Systems Silver Apple,” he said. “All races on the day will have a minimum of $30,000 prize-money, which is a great incentive for owners, trainers and jockeys in the central west.” The Orange Gold Cup is one of the oldest and most prestigious country races in NSW, the first was run in 1870 – almost 150 years ago. The 2017 edition has already welcomed a blockbuster set of nominations too, headlined by last year’s champion trainer Bjorn Baker. The Warwick Farm trainer has two chances to claim a second consecutive Orange Gold Cup in Forreel and Crossley Hotshot. “Forreel is undoubtably a horse with untapped potential winning three of her 10 starts and no doubt she would be the best bred and most valuable horses running around on Friday,” Pilossof said. “Forreel is a half sister to the inaugural Championship winner It's A Dundeel who is now standing at stud. “No doubt her future will be as a valuable broodmare but a win in the Orange Cup would do no damage to her breeding credentials.” Other nominations in the feature race include multiple metropolitan race winner Chaquinta, which has won five races after a rather inauspicious start to her career. The five-year-old bay mare, trained by Joe Cleary, broke her maiden status in a 2100m race at the Orange picnic meet two years ago, since then she has raced in Group and listed company. “Citations, from the Greg Hickman stable at Warwick Farm, has enjoyed great success at Orange recently and is coming off a last-start at Canterbury and should be extremely competitive,” Pilossof said. “Hirokin, also from Warwick Farm, ran a great third in the Orange Cup Prelude and the gelding looks to be crying out for the 2100m distance on Friday. “Orange trainers are represented with Brad Draper nominating Eva Jean for the [feature race].” Racing will commence on Friday at 12.45pm, tickets are available online.

Enda Curran As Donald Trump prepares to go head to head with Xi Jinping on trade, China’s consumer power is kicking Asia’s export engine into gear, moving the world’s fastest-growing economies. Photo: Reuters Hong Kong: Philippine bananas, Indian cotton and New Zealand lamb have at least one thing in common. They’re all objects of resurgent Chinese demand. As Donald Trump prepares to go head to head with Xi Jinping on trade, China’s consumer power is kicking Asia’s export engine into gear, moving the world’s fastest-growing economies. Shipments to China from around the region have risen sharply in both value and volume, ending what economists at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group described as Asia’s two-year trade recession. Higher commodity prices are lifting export values for countries like Indonesia and Malaysia while rising oil prices have boosted Singapore and India. The planned launches of Samsung Electronics Co.’s new Galaxy S8 and Apple Inc.’s iPhone 8 are fuelling demand for semiconductors and other components made in South Korea and Taiwan. “Asian exports have staged a significant rebound,” said Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist at IHS Global Insight in Singapore. In Japan, exports are underpinning a modest economic recovery, with shipments to China, its biggest customer, jumping 28% in February, helping total exports rise the most in two years. South Korean exports rose the most in five years during the same month, thanks to accelerating shipments to China, which jumped by nearly a third from a year earlier. Indian exports to China rose by nearly half in December from a year earlier, driven by shipments of cotton, ores and zinc. The figure compares with a 5% drop in overall Indian exports, and pares the 7.7% decline in Indian exports to China for the full year. “Non-oil exports from India have really perked up over the last six months,” Arvind Subramanian, India’s chief economic adviser, told Bloomberg Television in an interview. “It’s a steady upward trend.” New Zealand’s shipments to China grew 12% in the three months to February, driven by demand for beef, lamb and milk powder, according to ANZ. There’s more to come. New Zealand wants to upgrade an existing trade deal with China and neighbouring Australia has signed a beef-export pact with China. In Southeast Asia, Thailand and Malaysia’s exports to China in January rose by nearly a third from a year earlier. Indonesian exports to China jumped almost 44% in February from a year earlier while Singapore’s soared 65% the same month. “China has more than doubled their imports of bananas in the last few months so, we’re OK,” Philippine finance secretary Carlos Dominguez said in an interview. To be sure, the sustainability of the export recovery is far from assured. Though volumes are up, much of the rebound reflects higher commodity prices and seasonal effects can provide a gloss to overall numbers. Beijing is faced with a challenge as it tries to rein in excessive debt and leverage while shifting the economy away from a reliance on stimulus. “You should expect China to slow this year,” said Mark McFarland, chief economist for Asia at Union Bancaire Privee in Hong Kong. Then there’s Trump. While he’s toned down threats of dramatic trade action against China, his administration appears committed to shrinking a yawning trade deficit through tariffs on the country’s goods or other punitive measures. Heightened trade tensions between the two largest economies would spill over to the rest of Asia given the region’s tightly knit supply chain and the US position as by far the worlds’ largest consumer market. “We’re a little worried about the US,” Dominguez said. “We’re not sure where they’re going.” A reluctance among companies to invest, excess capacity, and rising levels of debt also limit the prospects for a full-blown, export-driven recovery. Still, firming demand in East Asia is consistent with global trade volume growth of more than 5% on year in February, the fastest pace since 2011, according to Capital Economics. The China-driven rebound in exports is part of the reason Asia’s expansion will probably exceed 5% in 2017 and 2018, compared with about 3.5% for the world, according to the International Monetary Fund. China’s weight as a consumer is also being felt in Papua New Guinea, the resource-rich Pacific island nation. Prime Minister Peter O’Neill said exports are improving. “Asia is still the engine room of global growth,” O’Neill said in an interview. “I’m very positive.” Bloomberg Enda Curran Topics: China export India shipments Donald Trump More From Livemint READ MORE Apple sparks row with pledge to drop Imagination Tech graphics App Radar: Cool new apps for Android and iOS March PMI touches five-month high on new orders, output growth First Published: Mon, Apr 03 2017. 10 31 AM IST Editor's Picks Infosys promoters, board at odds over COO Pravin Rao’s salary hike Will Reliance Jio’s latest free offer salvo force Competition Commission’s hand?

Reuters/Carlos Barria CEOs of some of the world's biggest companies fight back against the policies of US President Donald Trump, claiming they’re un-American and bad for business. Business leaders are specifically against the president’s takes on climate change and immigration, which both have prompted major public outcry. General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt was among those who condemned Trump's climate policy.  He reportedly said Trump's executive order to start rolling back Obama-era fossil-fuel regulations does not alter what the company stands for- that climate change is real and has to be addressed on a global basis. Last week, Deere CEO Samuel Allen told CNBC that "any form of protectionism or nationalism," which the POTUS has advocated is not beneficial to their company. ExxonMobil has urged the White House not to ditch Paris climate accords, a multinational deal from which the new administration reportedly considers to withdraw. Meanwhile, Apple, Google-parent Alphabet and Facebook slammed Trump's original executive order that bans seven Muslim-majority countries. Coca-Cola Co. CEO Muhtar Kent had also expressed disapproval against the travel ban while Starbucks Corp. said it will hire 10,000 refugees over the next five years. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. also pushed back against the president’s policies. Meanwhile, some companies, such as Uber, offered assistance to employees affected by the travel ban. The company's CEO, Travis Kalanick, is part of Trump's economic advisory group. Darrell West, vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said the POTUS altered the thought process for businesses due to the amount of backlash his policies face. He noted that there have been boycotts for company executives that get too close to the president. West added that it becomes easier to publicly push back on a commander-in-chief when he has poor approval rating. Based on a Gallup poll, Trump had 35 percent approval rating last week after Republicans' failed effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, more popularly known as Obamacare. West’s claim was backed up by Michael Cohen, interim director of the political management program at George Washington University. "With his approval rating, he's not exactly going to scare anybody in the business community,” CNBC quotes him. Cohen added that Trump’s tweets are not proven damaging to the reputation of a business. For example, since he tweeted at Boeing on Dec. 6 criticizing the price of its Air Force One contract with the government, the company’s shares rose about 17 percent.
