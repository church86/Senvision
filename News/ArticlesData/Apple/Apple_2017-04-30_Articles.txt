Josh Smith03/10/2015 “Which Apple Watch size should I buy?” is the most common question we’ve heard in the last 24 hours from potential buyers who already know which Apple Watch model they want, but are having trouble choosing the right Apple Watch size. We’ll help you with a short and to the point guide to picking the right size Apple Watch for your wrist. The right Apple Watch size isn’t about being a man or a woman, it comes down to the size of your wrist and a few other factors. The small Appel Watch size is 38mm and the larger is 42mm. Read: Apple Watch vs Moto 360: Features & Price In terms of the actual size of the Apple Watch on your wrist this is 38 x 33.3 mm and 42 x 35.9mm. Both of the Apple Watch sizes are 10.5mm thick. How to pick the right Apple Watch size. Keep in mind that while we can help you pick an Apple Watch size, you can also go into an Apple Watch store on April 10th to try on the various Apple Watch sizes and models and pre-order before the Apple Watch release date on April 24th. You don’t need to wait though. Apple Watch Size Guide You can use an Apple Watch size guide at home to see what the two Apple Watch sizes look like on your wrist. You’ll need an iPhone or an iPad and the free Apple App Store app. Use the iPhone app to see the Apple Watch sizes on your wrist. Open the Apple App Store App and tap on Apple Watch and then Tap on one of the Apple Watch models. Next Tap on View Pricing in the upper right. In the middle of the next screen is a link to Compare case sizes. Tap on that to see the actual size of the Apple Watch on your iPhone. While you cannot see through the screen to your wrist, you can hold this up on your wrist to get a better idea of the Apple Watch size that best fits your wrist. This won’t replace actually trying an Apple Watch on at an Apple Store, but it is very handy. Print Apple Watch sizes true to life and try them on. The next best thing you can do is print the Apple Watch size guide from Kirkville, that delivers actual size Apple Watch photos from the App Store that you can cut out and put on your own wrist. Download the PDF and print it at 100%, don’t let your computer fit to page or any other scaling, and then cut out the watch face and set it on your wrist. What’s the Right Apple Watch Size? Is there a perfect watch size for men and a perfect watch size for women? We couldn’t find a straight answer about the best watch size for men or the best watch size for women that could help people choose the right Apple Watch size. Read: Apple Watch Price Details A Blog to Watch tells readers to buy the right watch size for your wrist, explaining in more detail what a good rule is for a man’s watch, “First, ensure that the lugs of a watch (those things that hold the strap) don’t extend over your wrist when wearing the watch. This can vary a lot because the same watch case size can have a lot of different lug sizes. The opposite is also true. If the lugs are no where near the ends of your wrist then the watch will appear dainty and feminine or child-like, and you don’t want that as well” In a poll on their site most men preferred a watch between 40 and 44 mm in size, which points to the larger Apple Watch size as a good bet. On Ask Men, the Watch Snob says that 39mm is the right size, which points to the smaller 38mm Apple Watch so there really is no perfect answer. According to JomaShop, the most popular woman’s watch sizes are from 26 mm to 36mm. This suggests a look at the smaller 38mm Apple Watch size, but there is also not a clear-cut best watch size. Apple Watch Band Size Guide Use this guide to pick the right Apple Watch band size. In addition to picking the right Apple Watch size you need to pick the right Apple Watch band size. Apple includes two bands in the Apple Watch Sport box so users can try the medium and large bands on. Read: The Do’s and Don’ts of Apple Watch Etiquette Once you graduate to the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition, or if you want to buy a new Apple Watch band for your Apple Watch Sport, you will need to look at the various sizes Appel offers. To figure this out, you need to measure your wrist circumference and see how it compares to the Apple Watch band sizing guide. It’s best to measure in mm, as Apple uses this on the listing. 30 Exciting Things You Can Do With the Apple Watch Answer Calls on the Apple Watch   1 / 30 You can answer a call on your Apple Watch using it as a small Bluetooth speaker phone.

(Image: Siddharth Safaya/News18.com) The government wants iPhone maker Apple to consider a new manufacturing scheme offering duty benefits to set up its plants in the country. "Apple had asked for a set of concessions. For a period of 15 years all the components that Apple imports, they want them to be free of duty. We have a phased manufacturing programme (PMP) because we want more and more value addition to come to the country. We want them to understand how this PMP will work and how they can dove tail into that," Ministry of Electronics and IT secretary Aruna Sundararajan told reporters.

IT and Law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has approved PMP and the government set to notify it. "Right now the value addition is minimal. We want to take it up. For that purpose we have just announced phased manufacturing programme for mobile phones," Sundararajan said. According to Indian Cellular Association, the PMP is expected to increase local value addition in mobile phone manufacturing to increase to 39-50% in next 3 years. Under PMP, the government has already imposed additional duty on import of mobile charger, battery pack and wired headset in 2016-17. In 2017-18, key components like mobile microphone and receiver, USB Cable, key pads will attract duty benefits. Components like camera module, mobile antenna etc will be given incentives or duty benefit in 2018-19 if procured locally by handset makers. Mobile phone makers will get benefit of tax or incentives on the touch panels, mobile screen, vibrator motor or ringer from 2019-20 onwards under the program. The phased manufacturing programme was proposed by a joint panel of the industry and the government - Fast Track Task Force. The panel set up under the MeitY has set target of 500 million handset production by 2019 and export target of 120 million mobile phones by 2019-20, taking annual manufacturing output in the range of Rs 1.5-3 lakh crore. In 2016-17, total value of mobile phone to be produced in India is likely to reach Rs 90,000 crore from Rs 54,000 crore in 2015-16.

Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. will in the coming days add evidence that tech behemoths command an ever widening share of consumer time and spending. Amazon’s revenue soared as shoppers favored it over brick-and-mortar stores, while Google parent Alphabet reported surging quarterly profit that highlighted the ubiquity of its search advertising business -- especially on smartphones. "Each has built unique moats that allow them to continue to dominate,” said Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie. “For Google, no one can catch them on search because of the technology and intellectual property. For Amazon, scale is their friend and no one can compete on selection, price and fulfillment capabilities.” The companies have vast networks of complementary products that feed off one another to generate more sales, making it ever harder for competitors to keep up. "Given the strength of Google and Amazon, we think Facebook is likely to look similar," Schachter said. On Wednesday, Facebook is expected to report first-quarter profit of $2.57 billion, up 70 percent from a year earlier, while revenue climbs 45 percent to $7.82 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. When Apple reports fiscal second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, sales are expected to climb 5 percent to $53 billion. Revenue from the App Store and other services such as Apple Music will likely jump 20 percent to $7.2 billion, according to UBS analyst Steven Milunovich. "The general theme that the big are getting bigger" applies to Apple’s self-feeding ecosystem, Schachter said. Every time Apple sells an iPhone, the customer buys apps and other services, feeding data such as photos and contacts into the device, making it harder to swap for a competitor’s device. Higher margin service revenue then feeds back into Apple’s development budget, helping it build more advanced products to sell to the same consumer. Google’s advertising business is very different, but has similar self-feeding qualities. The company got 97 percent of mobile paid search clicks in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2017, according to client data from digital marketing firm Merkle Inc. That was up from 82 percent in the same period in 2014. With more searches, Google gets more ad dollars to reinvest to keep its search engine ahead of the competition -- mostly represented by Microsoft Corp.’s Bing. Google also gets more data on what results people click on, which can be used to improve its software even more, and keep people coming back to find information. "There are clear benefits to that scale," Mark Ballard, senior director of research at Merkle, said. "There’s that feedback loop." For advertisers, Google’s large online audience makes it one of the first places to go to run online marketing campaigns. The other is Facebook. Merkle client spending on Facebook ads was up 71 percent in the first quarter, from a year earlier. These advertisers get about 70 percent of their online traffic from Facebook and that hasn’t changed in recent years despite the rise of competitors like Snap Inc., Ballard noted. Facebook and Google captured 77 percent of U.S. digital ad spending last year, up from 72 percent in 2015, according to a recent analysis of data from the Interactive Advertising Bureau by Pivotal Research Group. For advertisers it’s “easier to concentrate budgets with a smaller number of players. It’s easier to manage,” said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal. Marketers have long griped about the "duopoly" atop digital advertising. But they keep giving Google and Facebook money. That’s largely because few other places offer wide reach, channels for targeting consumers and better returns. Those advantages only multiply as the tech companies expand. Verizon Communications Inc.’s new Oath ad business "may figure out a special sauce, but they will never be the first port of call," Wieser said. When Google and Facebook get those calls first, they see what advertisers plan to spend elsewhere and can sell them other services and tools, according to the analyst. Advertisers disagree about what company could offer a viable third alternative. Some suggest another internet titan: Amazon. The largest online retailer isn’t a leading digital advertising destination yet, but on its earnings call last week, Chief Financial Officer Brian Oslavsky reported "consistent growth" from that business. Research firm EMarketer expects the company to generate more display ad revenue than Twitter Inc. by next year. Even so, most of Amazon’s first-quarter revenue gains came from grabbing retail market share as more people shop online, rather than in stores. That shift is fueling a record pace of retailer bankruptcies this year, despite a growing U.S. economy and solid consumer spending. What began with bookstores, movie rental outlets and electronics retailers like Borders, Blockbuster and Circuit City, is spreading to apparel and sporting goods chains like Aeropostale Inc. and Sports Authority Holdings Inc.

Sign Up Once online spending in a category passes 20 percent, it’s tough for brick-and-mortar retailers to survive and easy for Amazon to gobble up market share, said Guru Hariharan, chief executive officer of Boomerang Commerce Inc., which designs software for large retailers. Amazon has been disciplined about only pursuing retail categories that are already shifting online, giving it momentum against competitors playing defense, he said, adding that more apparel bankruptcies will come in the next two years. Like Google, which has introduced the Pixel smartphone to help secure its direct relationship with consumers, Amazon has introduced the Echo smart speaker to encourage customers to buy services and products from its website. The software makers are expanding into hardware to feed their money machines. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

In a paper posted online on Thursday, April 27, Facebook security researchers said the company will monitor the efforts of those who try to hurt âcivic discourseâ on its service. It is also looking to identify fake accounts, and says it will notify people if their accounts have been targeted by cyber-attackers.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) Credit: Courtesy HEAVY COMPETITION: Jeff Bezos, left, Mark Zuckerburg and Apple have all recently come up with apps to compete with Snapchat. prev next comments This is shaping up to be the year that Wall Street giants tripped all over themselves to compete with Snapchat, rolling out new apps and gadgets that span the gamut from weird to winners. Apple, Amazon and Facebook are the biggest bandwagon jumpers, clamoring to steal a bit of the Snapchat magic and satisfy investors who fear an exodus in advertising revenue and attention. Most recently, an ingenious new device from Amazon takes a page from Snapchat’s selfie-obsessed handbook and feeds it to a machine-learning algorithm contained in the software of the upcoming Echo Look. It’s a new version of the hardware line powered by Amazon’s virtual assistant, Alexa — except now she’s judging your look. Those machine-learning algorithms are combined with advice from fashion specialists, according to Amazon, to form a new virtual opinion service called Style Check. Although most of the tech media has bought into the Amazon narrative that this is part of CEO Jeff Bezos’ play for a bigger chunk of fashion retail — and that’s certainly part of it — this is also another piece of technology that follows the Snapchat equation: take a selfie, get told you’re fabulous. I fully expect some Snapchat-reminiscent features to come to the Echo Look, like face filters and fashion “stories,” to name a few. Apple’s answer to Snapchat came last month: a free app called Clips that provides on-the-fly video sharing. With cheeky little sayings and filters that can be applied to any video, it’s like app designers borrowed some of what they thought made Snapchat cool, and then plopped Apple’s user interface on top. It’s not a bad app, it just doesn’t seem to fit in with anything else that Apple has done recently — almost as if a decree came down from on high in Cupertino to “get in on this Snapchat thing,” and it was built just to satisfy that decree. But the most egregious Snapchat copycat is, of course, Facebook. First Facebook-owned Instagram launched a Snapchat-like Stories feature last year, then the largest network in the world rolled out a shameless knockoff of Snapchat’s core feature, My Story, in the form of Facebook Stories. As it turns out, users are more loyal to the features of Snapchat than to Snapchat itself. The launch of direct competitor Instagram Stories was like a fatal blow to Snapchat’s user growth rate. Snapchat growth users were growing at 17.2 percent in the first quarter, then by just 7 percent in the second quarter as the new Instagram feature launched. Even worse: In quarter four, Snapchat’s growth rate dipped to a dismal 3 percent, according to federal filings. Facebook is also cornering the international market, going after developing world markets on which Snapchat hasn’t had a chance to focus. The launch of an abridged version of the app, Facebook Lite, in countries like Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Cuba and even North Korea, is making Snapchat’s job harder by the day. The ending to this Wall Street fable is: Whatever you do, don’t compete with Facebook. Don’t even try.

By Kiko Antonio https://twitter.com/kikoTBB on May 1, 2017 11:55 AM Augmented reality and virtual reality computing are becoming more mainstream these days. At least that is true for virtual reality. Since the introduction of the Oculus Rift and many more products after that, many companies have seized the opportunity to jump onto the bandwagon. Now, it seems like Apple is doing the same on the Mac Pro 2018 as detailed in a recent patent filing. According to Patently Apple, the latest trademark filing from Apple about the Mac Pro includes reference to augmented reality. In the said document, Apple has also mentioned its patent for an augmented reality display. Mac Pro on VR and AR Since last year, there have been a number of reports suggesting that Apple is veering to the VR and AR side of computing. It’s upcoming iMac line of desktops is said to feature VR-ready graphics for today’s processing intensive virtual reality games and media contents. However, augmented reality is a different thing altogether. Microsoft Hololens AR headset (via microsoft.com) In the plainest sense, virtual reality is quite restrictive. All the environments within the virtual world are generated inside a computer. On the other hand, augmented reality requires inputs from the users’ surroundings and superimposes information upon the said environment. Applications for augmented reality are varied. Nevertheless, most of these applications center on machine learning and artificial intelligence. When used in conjunction to machine learning, the possibilities of augmented reality are boundless. Unfortunately, this would also mean the computer specializing in augmented reality will require immense processing prowess. And this is where the Mac Pro 2018 will fit in. Mac Pro hardware specs Apple has already announced that it will revisit the modular design for the next-generation Mac Pro. This means that it will be, once again, open to upgrades from third-party hardware providers. Users will soon be able to swap in a more powerful graphics card like they used to on older Mac Pros. Furthermore, there could also be an option for an extra CPU on the motherboard; something that is absent on the current-generation Mac Pro. While these are nothing but speculations, no one can deny the raw power that the older Macs are capable of. For now, consumers can expect the same raw power that they come to know from a Mac Pro. With modularity in mind, users stand a chance of putting extra compute power on future Mac workstations. Perhaps, this time around, consumers could be looking at dual processor towers like it used to ten years ago. Current generation Mac Pro (via apple.com) With regards to graphics, Apple has two options. It could either go for NVIDIA or AMD when it comes to high-performance GPUs. The current Polaris lineup, with its Titan X line and GTX 1080 Ti graphics cards, NVIDIA is a good choice for Apple. On the other hand, AMD with its Radeon RX Vega graphics cards, due to release soon, is a fair candidate. With the prospect of modularity, perhaps this issue would not matter anymore. Users can probably swap in a graphics cards of their choosing any time they want. This will be exceptionally easier especially now that NVIDIA just released the macOS drivers for its Polaris-line of graphics cards. Nevertheless, with the current lineup of notebooks and desktops, there is a strong chance that Apple might go for AMD. On other hardware specs, rumour has it that the Mac Pro 2018 will support a minimum of 16GB RAM. This size is expandable to 64GB and of course, since a server-grade processor is on-board, ECC-type memories are also expected. In terms of storage, a faster NVMe drive is also on the table. That, along with Thunderbolt 3 as a replacement to the old Thunderbolt port. For more tech updates on the Mac Pro 2018, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumour Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Contact Us The Bitbag Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumors Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Reviews iPhone iPhone 8 Specs, Price & Release: 10th Anniversary Phone Won’t Have S Version By Necta Casiple on May 1, 2017 12:24 PM PHOTOGRAPH: YouTube/ConceptsiPhone | What Apple plans to call its next-generation iPhone remains up for debate, but speculations are rife it will make a huge break from its usual naming traditions. Regardless, the upcoming device famously dubbed the iPhone 8 today is reportedly skipping the “S” version too, rather sticking to a single, high-end model. From what we’ve gathered from an assortment of credible rumors, the tech giant’s 2017 iPhone lineup actually consists of three distinct models: an iPhone 7s, an iPhone 7s Plus, and the unnamed high-end iPhone. But since the latter is in celebration of Apple’s 10th anniversary, it seems unlikely to receive an “S” name. Over the years, we’ve come to realize that any succeeding model with the moniker “s” is merely a plain upgrade over the predecessor. The iPhone 6, for instance, may have been the first ever to ditch the signature 4-inch screen and have a massive design overall. However, its “S” edition looked pretty much the same with only some incremental upgrades under the hood. This is why all the hype has been on the so-called iPhone 8, despite reports that a 7s and 7s Plus are also underway. It could replicate the iPhone 7 and bring some upgrades that may seem worthy, but not meet the high expectations of fans and critics alike. Now, since it’s an anniversary model, Apple will definitely introduce major changes to the premium iPhone. That said, it could also very well opt to skip directly to the next full number, simply naming it the iPhone 8 or whatever it decides to name the handset. To keep you updated, here’s a full list of how the tech giant named its smartphone line over the years, courtesy of Mac Rumors. 2007 – iPhone 2008 – iPhone 3G 2009 – iPhone 3GS 2010 – iPhone 4 (new design) 2011 – iPhone 4s 2012 – iPhone 5 (new design) 2013 – iPhone 5s 2014 – iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus (new design) 2015 – iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus 2016 – iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus 2017 – iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, iPhone 8 (tentative) Naming: What will the next-gen iPhone be called? At this point, the most popular moniker of the iPhone 7 successor is, of course, iPhone 8—a reflection of the fact that the device will introduce a brand new form factor. However, if Apple releases it alongside two iPhone 7s models, the numerical naming scheme alone would immediately make the two brand new iPhone 7s models appear outdated. Sure they are new devices, but the two upgrades standing next to the iPhone 8 would seem like old news. So, what would be a more logical name? So far, there are two other suggestions that experts think are more likely to make it to the cut than “iPhone 8.” iPhone Edition – It’s a clever name for Apple’s upcoming device as it designates the iPhone as a premium device without diminishing the appeal of the iPhone 7s. In effect, the iPhone 7s would be positioned as the MacBook to the iPhone Editon’s MacBook Pro. iPhone Pro – The name has a similar effect as the moniker “Edition” but complements Apple’s other premium products like the iPad Pro and MacBook Pro. Since the next-gen iPhone is said to be a high-end device, calling it the “iPhone Pro” seems logical. But there’s a catch. Apple updates the iPhone every year, so numerical suffixes are essential for both consumer comprehension and Apple’s advertising efforts. Should the company decide to ditch the numbers, what happens when it releases out a new model the next year, or the year after that? Chances are the models will be distinguished through its year of launch similar to the MacBook and iPad line. But it would effectively be sacrificing long-term clarity for short-term simplicity. What features are coming to the new iPhone? Whatever the name is, we can expect the iPhone will have top-notch specs and massive changes if the rumors are anything to go by. We’ve rounded up the likely features coming to the device below: 5.8-inch screen 2800×1242 pixels Edge-to-edge OLED display iPhone 4S-esque glass body Touch ID sensor embedded on the screen USB-C support Wireless charging support AR support 3D, Vertical Dual Camera system Gigabit LTE A11 processors (matching the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835) Apple-manufactured GPU IP68 water resistance rating Advanced biometric features such as facial recognition or iris scanning Increased storage space, possibly in 64 and 256GB options 3GB RAM 2,700 mAh L-shaped two-cell battery Enhanced Siri functionality True Tone Technology for Mood Lighting How much will it cost? We can expect the OLED iPhone is going to be pricey. Analysts predict it could sell beyond $1,000 which is a good deal more expensive than previous models. But more recently, a UBS analyst theorized that the 64GB entry-level model would start at $850—similar to the new Samsung Galaxy S8+—and that the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus would cost $649 and $749, respectively. Alleged iPhone 8 dummy by Benjamin Geskin. When will it hit the shelves? With the radical design changes Apple plans to incorporate in the new model, rumors have been suggesting there will be serious supply constraints. Assuming the annual announcement tradition continues, the iPhone 8 release date will be in September 2017 at the earliest. However, there is a chance it won’t be released until one or two months after its introduction. Alternatively, the tech giant may roll it out in small numbers, with the majority of people unable to get their hands on it until the first quarter of 2018. Note though that none of the these has been verified so far. Apple isn’t the type to reveal anything about its upcoming products prior to their official releases so take the aforementioned with a grain of salt. But as we creep closer to September and start to see the first batch of leaks, we should have a much clearer picture of what to expect from the premium iPhone in the coming weeks at least. We’ll be sure to update you here at The BitBag, though, should there be fresh news about the device. In the meantime, let us know what you think of the current iPhone rumors.

Photos Videos Topics Live WI 286/6 (89) - PAK (Yet to bat) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Narendra Modi Donald Trump Bahubali 2 Exam results 2017 IPL 2017 News World News Investors, South Korean tech suppliers brush off N.Korea threat Shares1 Fri, 28 Apr 2017-09:40am , Reuters Growing tensions with North Korea should worry global electronics firms such as Apple Inc as they source key parts from South Korea, but investors are brushing off such concerns and snapping up shares in key exporters, heartened by robust earnings and big investment plans. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday in an interview with Reuters that a major conflict with North Korea is possible in the standoff over its nuclear and missile programs, though he would prefer a diplomatic resolution. South Korea, a U.S. ally and home to major electronics parts makers such as Samsung Electronics, LG Display and SK Hynix, would be particularly vulnerable to any military attack from its northern neighbor. Any interruptions to operations could significantly disrupt global manufacturing of smartphones, televisions, computers and tablets. South Korea supplies more than half of components such as memory chips and flat screens. Despite escalating tensions, investors are pouring money into South Korea's financial market, and companies are flocking to the stock market to raise billions of dollars. "This is mainly just chest-thumping behavior on the part of North Korea and President Trump, but I don't think it will be anything more than that," said Geoff Pazzanese, a senior portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York. Pazzanese, who owns large positions in Samsung and chipmaker Hynix, said he would be a buyer if the market sold off as a result of a North Korean nuclear test, partly because the Trump administration has reaffirmed its military support for South Korea. Seoul's stock market has climbed 9 percent so far this year to near record highs, helped by strong earnings by major exporters including Samsung Electronics, which rose 3 percent to a life-time high on Friday after reporting its highest profit in more than three years. Earlier this week, Hynix and LG Display, both Apple suppliers, reported record quarterly profits and sounded upbeat for the remainder of the year. "The tension might mean some sentimental risk more than fundamental risk," said John Teng, an equity analyst at Janus Capital Group in Singapore. "It might potentially push their customers to restocking earlier, in terms of component inventory. Memory suppliers, they are very disciplined in terms of capacity expansion." Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic advisor at the Allianz Group, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Friday that investors should take a more critical look at their exposure, but had been conditioned to set aside such risks. "And they have been rewarded well by markets for doing so." he added. South Koreans have grown used to the threat of conflict with the North after decades of bellicose rhetoric from Pyongyang, and the companies remained unruffled on Friday. "We think talk of conflict is speculative, and we do not have any plans to react to the current situation," LG Electronics said in a statement. Hyundai Motor, the country's top automaker, said it had detailed contingency plans to ensure business carried on under various situations but couldn't disclose them. RATIONING Any military conflict on the Korean peninsula could have a dramatic effect on the memory chip market in particular, as Samsung's and Hynix's main operations are clustered in South Korea. The pair control nearly 50 percent of the flash memory market, and almost two thirds of DRAM chips, widely used in computers, making it almost impossible for customers to find alternative supplies quickly. As supply of those chips are already tight, any interruptions to their manufacturing operations might cause large customers such as Apple and Lenovo to trigger a contractual term known as an "allocation" to get more of their suppliers' limited supply, according to industry executives. Those fights often get ugly, with corporate giants throwing their weight around with suppliers, said Trevor Schick, a former supply chain executive at H-P Enterprise and Motorola Mobility. "In the memory world, the minute things go into allocation, everyone is in a fight for who gets into the allocation. Scale plays a big role in that," Schick said. "Most contracts have a formula for how the allocation happens. But when it does, everyone from the big companies gets on planes to Asia to get in front of those CEOs and lay out their case as to why they should get the memory." Samsung, Hynix and LG Display declined to comment. Apple declined to comment. The ultimate beneficiaries of supply interruptions in South Korea would likely be Japan's Toshiba Corp, and U.S. firms Micron Technology Inc and Western Digital Corp . Toshiba's production is mostly in Japan, while Micron's is clustered in the United States and Singapore. But the geopolitical wild card could be China, Schick said. "If something did happen in Korea, the massive impact would be in China. Most of that memory goes from Korea into China to be made into tablets, phones and computers," Schick said. The vast majority of Apple's iPhones, for example, are manufactured in China by its partner Foxconn.

(Callie Jones / Sterling Journal-Advocate) Jen Janes, English teacher at Peetz High School, accepts her Crystal Apple Award at a banquet Friday. (Heather Thomas / Sterling Journal-Advocate) The mood was jovial as teachers and staff from Logan County's four school districts — RE-1 Valley, Merino, Fleming and Peetz — as well as Northeastern Junior College gathered for the Journal-Advocate's inaugural Crystal Apple Awards held Friday at the Sterling Elks Lodge. Merino Superintendent Rob Sanders served as the emcee for the event. He started the evening talking about the struggles all four school districts in Logan County have suffered due to the negative factor, a method the legislature has used in recent years to reduce the Amendment 23-mandated increase in school funding. Since 2010, the four school districts have lost a combined $22 million due to the negative factor. That's money that could be used for a variety of things, including helping to keep programs running and to better pay teachers and staff. Carol Clark, maintenance member at Fleming Schools, accepts her Crystal Apple Award at an awards banquet Friday. (Heather Thomas / Sterling Journal-Advocate) Sanders discussed the difficulty the school districts face in trying to attract quality educators, as they must compete with neighboring states whose school districts often offer salaries that districts in Northeastern Colorado cannot match. He also commended teachers and staff for the excellent job they do providing a quality education to students, despite the many challenges that schools face in funding and other areas. The invocation was given by Journal-Advocate Publisher Julie Tonsing, who recalled her brief stint in teaching and commended the educators for doing what is one of the most important jobs there is, preparing their students to become responsible citizens of this country.

Latest smartphone stats: Chinese brands gain, Apple and Samsung fall Chris Keall Monday May 1, 2017 Share Oppo's flagship R9s, just released in New Zealand exclusive to 2degrees and JB Hi-Fi Related Audio: IDC analyst Chayse Gorton on Oppo's push into NZ (March 14) Play Log in or subscribe to listen to audio. Pause Add to MyNBR Radio 0 0:00 0:10 Play NBR radio on Market leaders Samsung and Apple have fallen slightly in IDC's latest worldwide smartphone shipment figures, while a trio of Chinese brands – Huawei, Oppo and Vivo – have gained. The latest figures for New Zealand also show Huawei making strong gains. Late 2016, it benefited from Samsung's firephone woes and Apple holding off until later this year for its next major redesign of the iPhone. Vivo is a peripheral presence in New Zealand. Oppo has just launched locally, initially exclusive to 2degrees and JB Hi-Fi. IDC says phone companies shipped a total of 347.4 million smartphones worldwide in the first quarter of 2017 as the market grew 4.3%, ahead of its previous forecast of 3.6% growth. Huawei, Oppo and Vivo have all outpaced market growth for over a year now. And as these companies gain share in new territories, the potential to continue this trend is high. None are as trendy as Apple or Huawei but all offer a lot of features at a keen price. And although many of their (invariably Android) models are aimed at budget buyers, Huawei and Oppo are also now producing handsets designed to compete head to head with Apple and Samsung's top-shelf product. "Although we have seen an abundance of premium redesigned flagships that just entered the market, moving forward we still expect most of the growth to come from more affordable models in a variety of markets," Anthony Scarsella, research manager with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, said. "Despite all the popularity and media hype over premium devices, we continue to witness a shift in many companies' portfolios geared toward affordable devices with premium-type styling compared to flagship models. Companies have started to implement a single premium design language that ultimately blurs the lines between the high-end and the low-end, allowing the average consumer to jump on the brand without a hefty upfront investment." Click to zoom  RAW DATA: IDC's Smartphone Company Highlights  Samsung regained control as the leader in the worldwide smartphone market despite a flat first quarter (zero year-over-year growth). Substantial discounts on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge helped move last year's flagships as they make way for the new S8 and S8+. Outside the high end, the product mix continues to shift toward more affordable models. The J-Series and A-Series drove significant volumes in both emerging and developed markets thanks to flagship-like design at more affordable price points. A refreshed A7, A5, and A3 earlier this quarter, along with a recently updated J-Series, and new flagship S8/S8+ should give Samsung a well-balanced portfolio across all regions in the second quarter. An early positive response to the recently launched S8 and S8+ looks promising as it may have finally put Samsung's Note 7 fiasco to bed. Apple remained essentially flat with shipments reaching 51.6 million units in the first quarter, up slightly from the 51.2 million shipped last year. The strong holiday fourth quarter carried into the month of January as the larger iPhone 7 Plus returned to stock across most channels in numerous regions. Apple introduced a refreshed iPhone SE with more storage capacity (32GB and 128GB) that puts the mid-tier device in line with the rest of the iPhone portfolio. The Cupertino-based giant also refreshed its flagship smartphone by bringing (Product)Red over to the iPhone, which paints both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in a new red finish. Finally, rumours of a special edition 10th anniversary iPhone continue to grow as a pending new design, screen size, and performance upgrades all look to be in the works for the fall. Huawei sustained its dominance in China growing nearly 22% as shipments climbed from 28.1 million units last year, to 34.2 million units in the first quarter of 2017. Huawei once again demonstrated its stable position in the premium market with the P and Mate Series, and a strong presence in the affordable sector with its Y Series and Honor brand. Although Huawei announced earlier in the month the Mate 9 has sold over five million units since it launched in November, in the US the device, as well as the brand, has failed to grab consumers' attention. This US attention is something they will need if they aspire to displace the two market leaders. The launch of the new P10 flagship and the new P10 Plus at the very end of the quarter presents consumers a valid third option (outside Apple and Samsung) for the coming quarter thanks to both premium design and similar performance. OPPO's mid-range, camera-focused R9s was a crucial model in China that helped it to see strong shipments in the market. OPPO's growth has in fact been stronger outside China, with nearly a quarter of shipments from international markets. In the rest of Asia and to a smaller degree in the Middle East and Africa regions, its strong retail presence has helped it to grow further in its business. It has been aggressive in both above-the-line and below-the-line activities in India, and stepped up with its after-sales service efforts in several Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia by increasing its number of service centres. Vivo also relied on a key model with the x9 in China that continued to generate a lot of hype around its selfie camera features, targeted at the under-30 crowd. It stepped up with its marketing efforts in India and was a sponsor of the Indian Premier League 2017, helping to increase Vivo's brand presence in the market, while also increasing the number of exclusive stores in India. In Southeast Asia, it continues to have its own promoters aggressively pushing its phones in the market. In Indonesia, it has also promised consumers single-day phone repairs as a differentiator to the competition.

By TimMullaney Writer In the predictions biz, it’s inevitable that you’re wrong sometimes. Or “early,” “premature,” “half-right,” or the other excuses we use. But here’s a prediction I’d thought I’d stash in a dark corner of my archive of 2015-era foolishness, which suddenly looks correct after all: Apple AAPL, -0.10%   may still hit $1 trillion in stock-market value in 2017, and second-quarter earnings May 2 may make this even clearer. That, at least, is the analysis of Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha, whose report last week said Apple’s worth $170 to $176 a share. The higher number works out to $935 billion in market valuation, up from above $754 billion at Friday’s close — close to the $1 trillion target. The best part: None of the weaker parts of 2015’s Trillion-Dollar-Apple case have to come true to make it likely. Back then, I was skeptical of all three members of the Holy Trinity of the Fanboy Case. Apple Pay is, as I predicted, a rounding error in Apple’s greater scheme, while the Apple Car program is still vaporware (despite the company asking for permission to test driverless cars on California roads). And the Apple Watch sold an estimated $2.6 billion worth of watches in the holiday quarter, a pace for about a third of what bullish 2015 estimates supposed. Instead, Garcha says Apple’s services business, which includes Apple Pay but also the much larger App Store and iTunes businesses, is the driver; he says it can double revenue, to $52 billion, though he’s vague about when. Other analysts, and me, think the stock’s real driver is the iPhone 8, with new features like wireless charging and an all-glass front surface sparking forecasts that the initial production run will top 100 million units. What I missed back then was the drop in sales to Greater China that would slam Apple shares last year. I said Apple’s value would hit $1 trillion in early 2017; thanks to China, now it looks like the fourth quarter, or early 2018. That’s not the worst mistake: Calculating when markets might stop ignoring flaws, like China’s debt load, that have long been apparent is more art than science. At least I didn’t predict 2018 Watch sales of $26 billion like Deutsche Bank. My calculation then was that Apple needed profits to boost its operating business’ valuation to about $750 billion from $600 million, while its then-$140 billion cash pile grew to $250 billion. But Apple has generated so much cash since then that the job has gotten easier: It looks likely to have $350 billion in cash by year-end, so the operating business only needs to be worth $650 billion. That’s not difficult: Garcha’s says Apple will make $73.7 billion this fiscal year before non-cash charges, taxes and interest. A $650 billion valuation is 8.7 times that, modest even for a relatively mature company, let alone one boosting EBITDA by double digits this year and next. So what happened to let Apple maybe hit the target after all? A few not-very-complicated things. First, China stabilized. The 47% drop in the Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +0.08%   from June 2015 to January 2016 helped Apple’s Greater China sales drop 17% in fiscal 2016. But it ended, as market panics tend to do. You don’t have to think China’s stocks are now undervalued — I don’t — to believe that an economy growing 6%-plus per year can let local sales stabilize, or even make up some losses. Second, iPhone sales have been pretty good. Even with China’s problems, iPhone sales rose 5% in the first quarter. Third, Apple’s cash pile grew faster than I expected. As Apple had $247 billion of cash and securities on Dec. 31, matching the $250 billion I thought it would have this year. Given that Apple had almost $24 billion in free cash flow in the December 2016 quarter, the idea that this could be $350 billion by December isn’t far-fetched. That’s because… Fourth, the iPhone 8 got closer to market. With all those cool new features. Sure, Apple could still fall short. Garcha’s analysis assumes Apple builds its high-margin services business through high-profile acquisitions like Disney DIS, -0.21%   or Netflix NFLX, -0.57% which are speculative. China is debt-ridden and untransparent, as ever. And putting Apple’s offshore cash to work — say, to buy Disney — depends on President Donald Trump getting a corporate-tax bill through Congress. But the real case for Apple, blurred by the mad love of its trade press, is that the iPhone’s a machine, the services businesses grew 22% last year, and cash is real money. Investing should always be so straightforward.

You may be a sheeple. Some companies envy how Apple fans show devotion to Apple’s products. They’re sometimes called “Apple fanboy or fangirl” But Merriam-Webster weighed it in. In a tweet last week, the company used the word “sheeple” to describe Apple fans. First, the company describes it as “people who are docile, or easily influenced.” Then, it showed how this word could be used in a sentence: “Apple’s debuted a battery case for the juice-sucking iPhone—an ungainly lumpy case the sheeple will happily shell out $99 for. — Doug Criss” Apple didn’t comment on this report. A lot of people are wondering whether it’s just a way for M-W to grab headlines. In March, the dictionary poked fun at President Trump after he repeatedly misspelled “hereby.” It shared the definition for the word. Trump misspelled such word repeatedly in his tweets about an investigation surrounding Nancy Pelosi. Trump wrote, “I hear by demand a second investigation.” But such tweet disappeared and replaced it with the same tweet, but this time it used “hearby.” However, this tweet, too, disappeared and it was replaced with the same tweet but with the correct spelling of “hereby.” Merriam-Webster has the habit of needling Trump on Twitter. It mocked the president’s frequent misspelling of several words and defined those non-existent words. But the dictionary doesn’t just ridicule the president. It also mocked Ivanka Trump after she said in an interview that she didn’t have no clue about the meaning of “complicit.” During an interview with Gayle King, she addressed critics that she and her husband are complicit with the president. “I don’t know what it means to be complicit, but I hope time will prove I have done a good job and that my father’s Administration is the success I know it will be.” After she said that, Merriam-Webster tweeted that the word “complicit” was trending. Then, it included a link to the definition of complicit. As for the sheeple word, M-W isn’t the first dictionary to recognize its significance. This word is on Oxford English Dictionary, too. But the word sheeple existed before Apple did. It was fist used in 1945. Some people find the description about “Apple fans” funny. Others, however, aren’t happy. Apple fans might just have to laugh it off. But who’s behind the viral tweets of Merriam-Webster? Lauren Naturale is the person behind those viral tweets. She’s the dictionary’s social media manager. However, the voice of the dictionary on social media is inspired by conversations that the team had in its office. Her team decides what to tweet based on what words people are looking up online. It’s the reason of its Trump-related posts. Its goal is to report that a public figure is using a language that provokes curiosity of Americans. Then, it sends its followers to the dictionary’s website for information on the meaning or usage of the word. So, if you’re a devoted fan of Apple, did you like the word “sheeple” to describe Apple fans?

Thanks for reading and your comments.        See you all again tomorrow morning from 9. 4:43pm If the Reserve Bank was still retaining its narrow focus on keeping inflation between 2 and 3 per cent per annum, it would be cutting interest rates at its May meeting on Tuesday. Futures traders and economists are almost certain it won't, and will, instead, keep rates steady for the ninth straight month when it meets tomorrow. Market economists are glad for the RBA's ability to look beyond inflation rates when setting the interest rate – though opinions differ on what exactly it should be focusing on. The domestic economic is growing, but still weak. And the currency is still high – factors that some say should lead the RBA to cut rates. But record-low interest rates, others argue, have added oomph to booming housing markets in Sydney and Melbourne, leading them to conclude raising interest rates would be the most effective way to address this. "I think they should be cutting," said Market Economics' Stephen Koukoulas, an economic adviser to former prime minister Julia Gillard. "We had confirmation last week that underlying inflation has been stuck below the bottom of the target band for what, 18 months, and shows few signs of picking up. "We've got no prospect of underlying inflation moving into the target. "Add to that unemployment edging up, underemployment high, retail sales weak ... to me those criteria would suggest that we need lower rates." If the RBA were solely concerned with inflation-targeting, it would be cutting to 1 per cent, said Capital Economics' chief Australia/New Zealand economist Paul Dales. The Australian economy, he said, would benefit from a lower currency.  "One thing [RBA] governor [Philip] Lowe has communicated effectively is his growing concerns about financial stability. That's why economists are thinking on these lines – governor Lowe himself said he's concerned about dealing with a mess in five years' time when the housing market pops. "I think interest rates should be around where they are – and should stay there for a long time. It's not an ideal situation ... but now is not the right time to keep going [at inflation]."

Housing prices, which have in Sydney doubled since 2009 and are contributing to high indebtedness of some households - a topic RBA Governor Philip Lowe is due to give a speech about on Thursday. Photo: Bloomberg 4:38pm Shares have ended at the session's high and now within 50 points of the elusive 6000-point level after news late morning suggested US congress had managed a deal that would avoid a government shutdown helped push Wall St futures higher and helped the ASX overcome its early wobbles. OK, that's a long lede, but stay with us. The ASX 200 added 32 points or 0.5 per cent to 5956, preparing for another assault on the 6000-mark - a threshold it tried and failed to overcome on four different occasions some 2 years ago. Its looking increasingly likely the banks will push us over the brink thanks to what are expected to be strong earnings numbers in the coming days. They moved in and out of favour this morning before ultimately pushing higher: Westpac added 0.7 per cent, ANZ 0.6 per cent, NAB 0.3 per cent and CBA 0.1 per cent. Macquarie added 1.2 per cent. Only one in four of the top 200 names were lower, reflecting the day's gains was more than a financial sector story. Telstra's 0.9 per cent gain was a help, as was a 1.4 per cent jump in Wesfarmers and a more modest 0.6 per cent gain. BHP added 0.7 per cent, but Rio and Fortescue lost 1 per cent. South32 fell 2.2 per cent. Mayne Pharma was the worst performer in the top 200 after announcing lower than expected sales from its generic drugs portfolio. Outside the bigger names, footwear retailer RCG Corp plunged 27 per cent on an earnings downgrade. Winners and losers today in the top 200. Photo: Bloomberg 4:18pm In our latest instalment of "healthcare stocks behaving badly" (allegedly): Australia's largest private hospital operator Ramsay Health Care is being accused of threatening to reduce surgeons' access to operating theatres in Coffs Harbour if they became involved with a competitor. Competition regulator ACCC brought a Federal Court claim against Ramsay on Monday, alleging misuse of market power and exclusive dealing. ACCC alleges when Ramsay became aware that a group of Coffs Harbour surgeons were planning to establish a competing private day surgery facility in Coffs Harbour, senior Ramsay executives told these surgeons if they became involved with the competitor Ramsay would substantially reduce or withdraw their access to operating theatre time at Baringa Hospital. It is alleged the surgeons suspended their plans to establish a competing day surgery as a result of Ramsay executives' threats. Ramsay operates Baringa Private Hospital and the Coffs Harbour Day Surgery, the only private hospital and private day surgery facilities in the Coffs Harbour region. "New independent day surgeries in other areas have increased competition, reduced waiting lists and costs, delivered greater choice, and improved access to surgical procedures. It is vital to ensure such competition is not stamped out by established operators," ACCC chairman Rod Sims said. "Misuse of market power and other anti-competitive practices can cause significant harm to consumers, other businesses, and the competitive process more generally, which is why we believe this is an important case for us to take," he said. ACCC is seeking pecuniary penalties, declarations, compliance program orders and legal costs against Ramsay. Ramsay said in an ASX statement it intends to vigorously defend the matter. "As the matter is now before the court, Ramsay will not be making any further comment ont he allegations other than as required to keep the market informed in accordance with its continuous disclosure obligations." Ramsay shares fell 1.4 per cent today to $70.70. 3:37pm Mayne Pharma buried its bad news a long way back in its presentation to investors today but when shareholders caught on their reaction was sharp. The company's shares plunged more than 10 per cent after it revealed sales for a flagship suite of US generic drugs would not meet guidance. The news was buried on on page 107 of a 110-page oupdate released to coincide with an investor day the company was holding today. The company said in the investor update that tougher generic drug pricing was behind the revised guidance for the suite of drugs called the Teva portfolio. Mayne bought the portfolio of drugs from pharmaceutical giant Teva Pharmaceuticals last year for $845 million. The aquisition saw Mayne's first-half profit soar 278 per cent to $72.7 million in February. Mayne, which is worth more than $1.8 billion, re-affirmed its full-year profit guidance only a few weeks ago during its first half results in February. Chief executive Scott Richards said at the time that the outlook for the group "continues to be positive with significant growth opportunities from recent acquisitions, new product launches, further business development activities and transaction-related revenue and cost synergies." He said the generic product division would benefit in the second half from a full six-months' contribution from the Teva product acquisition. Mayne shares also dived in December on the back of a US price fixing lawsuit. The civil complaint filed by 20 US states accuses six companies – including Teva and Mayne – of conspiring to artificially inflate prices on an antibiotic and a diabetes drug.

The company's bad news was buried at the end of a 110-page update. Photo: Josh Robenstone Back to top 3:10pm US House and Senate negotiators reached a tentative bipartisan deal on Sunday night (Monday AEDT) on a $US1.1 trillion bill to keep the government open until the end of September, according to Republican and Democratic aides. GOP leaders eager to focus on health care and tax overhauls bowed to Democratic demands to eliminate hundreds of policy restrictions aimed at curbing regulations from the bill, leaving the Trump administration with few victories. The White House sought funding to begin building the border wall, a well as $18 billion in cuts to domestic agencies, and both demands were rebuffed. The spending deal includes money for Planned Parenthood, despite Republican demands to defund the group over its provision of abortions. The deal's provisions were described by aides on condition of anonymity ahead of a formal announcement. President Donald Trump will be able to point to a $15 billion boost for the Pentagon, although $2.5 billion of that money is contingent on the administration delivering a new plan to fight Islamic State. Trump also will get a $1.5 billion for border security, but it can't be used for the border wall or additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, according to a congressional aide. There are also no new restrictions on money going to so-called sanctuary cities that don't fully enforce federal immigration laws. "This agreement is a good agreement for the American people, and takes the threat of a government shutdown off the table," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Sunday night in a statement. "The bill ensures taxpayer dollars aren't used to fund an ineffective border wall, excludes poison pill riders, and increases investments in programs that the middle-class relies on, like medical research, education, and infrastructure." Donald Trump will be able to point to a $15 billion boost for the Pentagon. Photo: AP 2:33pm The backer of a Chinese joint-venture in advanced talks with Quintis to become its new preferred buyer in China is a former director of the Australian sandalwood grower. Graeme Scott has held board seats on Quintis' finance arm Arwon Finance, Quintis Forestry, Quintis Leasing and the parent Quintis, which was known as TFS at the time. Those directorships concluded in 2005 and 2006 and he remains a shareholder of the Perth-based group. Mr Scott is one of the parties behind a joint venture in China that is in negotiations with Quintis to become potentially its biggest buyer in China, following a disclosure in March that Quintis' largest buyer had yet to place an order this year amid a crackdown on duty avoidance by mainland importers. In an update on Monday, Quintis told shareholders that it struck an agreement with a mystery plantation investor at the eleventh hour to extend the life of a put option worth more than $30 million. The put, which if exercised forces Quintis to buy back immature sandalwood trees off the investor at a fixed price of previously $33.9 million, was due to expire on April 30. It is the second time it has been rolled over. Under the new terms, and "in light of the current corporate activity", it can be exercised between either July 10 to 14, or December 11 to 15 this year. If the investor exercises their option in the July window, the value of the contract is unchanged. If the investor elects to exercise in December, the value of the put increases by 6.25 per cent, a sweetener of 15 per cent on the equivalent annual rate. Quintis became a target of intense short selling when a contested research report published by US hedge fund Glaucus argued that Quintis shares were worth zero and likened the business to a Ponzi scheme, claims that the company consistently disputes. The subsequent fall in its share price was followed by the exit of its founder and chief executive Frank Wilson, who declared a plan to partner with a backer and take back the company. 1:57pm In an up-and-down day the ASX is once again pushing higher, with fluctuating interest in the major lenders accounting for much of the action. The ASX 200 is up 17 points, or by 0.3 per cent, to 5941. As mentioned, the big four banks are the swing factor. After starting all higher, they copped some selling later in the morning but are now mixed.  Westpac and ANZ are up a touch, NAB is flat, while CBA is off 0.3 per cent. Rio and Fortescue are down, but BHP has climbed. South32 is down 2 per cent, Wesfarmers is recovering from its trading update last week, up 1.7 per cent, while Woolies is 0.3 per cent ahead. One of the worst performers is Mayne Pharma, down 10 per cent as it lowered it sales guidance in its Teva generic drugs business. 1:50pm The flood of Israeli-based start-ups listing on the ASX is showing no signs of abating, with secure communications technology company Elsight the latest planning to go public on the exchange. The company is raising $6.5 million at 20¢ a share and a valuation of $18.17 million. It has met with a range of institutional investors and family offices on a roadshow in Australia this month. It joins the likes of Israeli firms Votiro Cybersec and CyberGym which are also listing on the ASX this year. Chief executive and co-founder Nir Gabay said the stock market in Israel was "weak", so firms had started looking for other options. "The next option was the NASDAQ, but you need to be a $1 billion company to list there, then you look at Hong Kong, but even then you need to be a $150 million company," he said. "But there is a good relationship between the ASX and Israel, so that was the best option for us." As part of the listing, Elsight has created a new Elsight Limited Australia company which will acquire the assets of Elsight Israel. The Israeli company is already profitable, having made a net profit of $US98,000 ($131,000) for the full year to December 31 and $US932,000 in revenue. Elsight's technology is designed for in-the-field communications and allows video and other data streams to be sent securely over multiple networks simultaneously, increasing bandwidth and allowing video to be streamed from the other side of the world in almost real time. It works by splitting the data into packages, encrypting these and then transmitting them via multiple sim cards, WiFi, LAN or radio networks and then reassembling it at the other end. The company was founded in 2009 by Mr Gabay and Roee Kashi, with the men having come from the Israeli special forces and military intelligence. Until recently Elsight had been prevented from selling internationally by the Israeli government. Elsight currently has customers in Israel, South Africa, Singapore, Vietnam and Malaysia. The capital raised through the listing will go towards research and development, as well as marketing, as it expands into other industries such as logistics, transport and media. Elsight co-founders Roee Kashi and Nir Gabay are taking the company public on the ASX. Photo: Paul Jeffers 1:17pm "It always feels odd talking in 't's and 'trillions' not 'b's and 'billions'," Duncan Burns says. "But we never lose sight of the fact that its our clients' money and they have entrusted us to manage it."   The former Wall Street investment banker and hedge fund trader probably oversees more money than just about any portfolio manager in Australia, but he's an unlikely subject for a profile. If Burns has any views on the market, compelling stock tips or diatribes about the stupidity of central bankers and politicians, he's not willing to share them. Instead, Vanguard's head trader wants to talk about how he and his team invest and trade hundreds of billions of dollars trying to track the region's stock market indices at the lowest cost. Last year he said, his team traded $100 billion of stocks in the region. "If we can save one basis point through more efficient trading on that $100 billion, that's $10 million saved in investors' accounts, right where it belongs." The one dominant trend in funds management is how every day, billions of dollars are given up on trying to beat the market, and moving from active funds to lower-cost passive funds. Vanguard, by virtue of its ultra low costs, has captured much of this flow and has swelled its assets under management to $5.4 trillion, of which $2.9 trillion are tracking equity indices around the world. The portfolio managers and traders based in Melbourne are responsible for $93 billion of funds across the Asia-Pacific region. As Burns explains, they're some of the toughest and highest cost equity markets in the world and when the objective is to track the stock market at the lowest possible cost. It's a daily challenge. "Indexing is really simple to understand and implement. However, it requires a lot of behind-the-scenes work to execute well. "The benchmark indices are calculated without the frictional cost of transacting in the real world – so right out of the gate we are behind as an indexing community." Read more at the AFR. Vanguard portfolio manager Duncan Burns doesn't give stock tips. Photo: Pat Scala Back to top 12:44pm Footwear retailer RCG Corp has slashed full-year profit guidance by 11 per cent – the second downgrade in three months – after sales of brands such as Skechers, Vans and Doc Martens remained weak in March and April. RCG, which owns Hype DC, The Accent Group and The Athletes Foot, now expects underlying EBITDA for the year ending June to come in between $74 million and $80 million, compared with $60 million in 2016. RCG shares have plunged 19 per cent to 67¢ in early trade on Monday, taking losses since February to 50 per cent. RCG cut its guidance in February from $90 million to between $85 million and $88 million after like-for-like sales at Hype went backwards in the eight weeks after Christmas and sales growth slowed in the Accent division.  RCG's co-chief executive Hilton Brett said trading conditions had been challenging in the last two months, confirming anecdotal reports that discretionary spending had remained lacklustre since consumers snapped their handbags closed after Christmas. Mr Brett said like-for-like sales in the Accent Retail and Hype business in March and April were flat. Whilst this was an improvement on trading between Boxing Day and mid-February, when Hype like-for-like sales fell 2.8 per cent, sales had not met management's expectations. The Athlete's Foot failed to grow sales, despite gains at rival chains such as Super Retail Group's Rebel Sport, while same-store sales at RCG's vertical retail business had fallen 5 per cent since mid-February and wholesale sales were below expectations. The latest downgrade is likely to fuel fears that the athleisure trend has peaked after five years of strong growth. "The slowing sales that RCG is experiencing are in line with our view that the growth rates experienced by athleisure footwear will moderate as the cycle matures," Citigroup's small cap consumer analyst Sam Teeger said in a recent report. The struggles at RCG Group may have to do with the waning of the athleisure trend more broadly. Photo: BrettHemmings.com 12:37pm Chinese gas distributor ENN and private equity firm Hony Capital now jointly hold a 12.81 per cent of embattled oil and gas group Santos after ENN revealedtoday that it was "acting in concert" with Hony. The move comes just days before the Santos annual general meeting scheduled to be held on Thursday. ENN, which is itself controlled by Chinese billionaire Wang Yusuo, became a big shareholder in Santos in March 2016 when it bought an 11.7 per cent stake, which had previously been held by Hony Capital. Hony bought up extra shares of its own accord in late 2016 and there has been much speculation in the market that the two had been working in unison. That has now been formalised by the Chinese duo, with the signing of an "Acting in Concert" agreement, which stretches for the next 24 months. There has been speculation from time to time about whether the Chinese firms may eventually seek more control of Santos. Hony originally became a shareholder in late 2015 when it took up a large chunk of shares in Santos as part of a share placement and equity raising. That capital raising and placement followed the rejection by the Santos board of a separate $7 billion takeover bid by an entity called Scepter Partners which was backed by the royal families of Brunei and the United Arab Emirates. ENN in late 2016 sent a letter to Santos chairman Peter Coates expressing annoyance at being denied a seat on the board after it pushed for a directorships because of its large holding. A substantial shareholder notice lodged with the ASX on Monday showed that ENN's stake in Santos was now 12.81 per cent, up from 11.82 per cent in the previous notice given by ENN to the ASX on May 2, 2016. Santos has been under the pump in the past week because Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is putting in place by July 1 a mechanism which will allow for the imposition of export controls to be placed on selected gas companies when there there is a shortfall of gas supply in the domestic market. Santos shares are 0.7 per cent lower at $3.46, and have plunged by more than a quarter of the past 12 months. Chinese gas distributor ENN now holds 12.81 per cent of Santos. Photo: Supplied 11:51am Prices in Sydney and Melbourne slowed in April mainly due to falls in apartment prices, but more data is needed before a cooling is confirmed, CoreLogic said in its April Hedonic Home Value Index. There was no increase in Sydney's overall house price in April while Melbourne's house price rose a small 0.5 per cent. Canberra posted the largest fall in prices among the capital cities of 2.8 per cent.  "The two hottest housing markets in the nation have shown signs of slowing down in April, with the CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index recording a rise of just 0.1 per cent over April, the lowest month-on-month rise in capital city dwelling values since December 2015," head of research Tim Lawless said. "The moderation in growth was due largely to a slightly negative April result in Australia's largest capital city housing market, Sydney, where dwelling values were broadly flat over the month." "The market is slowing down but we need to see a few more months before we make a a conclusion that the market has peaked. It's [still] coming down from such a high base." "We need to be cautious in calling a peak in the market after only one month of soft results. April, in particular, coincides with seasonal factors including Easter, school holidays and ANZAC day long weekend." Mr Lawless classified the fall in prices in Canberra and even a rise in prices in Darwin as "noise". But the impact of APRA's tightening on investor loans should not be disregarded although property agents said the impact of cooling measures would take time and over several months. "The softer results should also be viewed against a backdrop of an ever evolving regulatory landscape s which is firmly aimed at slowing investment and interest-only mortgage lending," Mr Lawless added. "Testament to this is mortgage rates which have been edging higher, particularly for investors and interest-only loans, as well as rental yields which have been hovering around record lows. The higher cost of debt, as well as stricter lending and servicing criteria, has likely dented investment demand over recent months." Sydney house prices have risen more than 70 per cent since 2012, but there has been a slowdown in April.  Photo: Wolter Peeters 11:30am Photo: The Wall Street Journal A year ago, many investors had given up on Apple, whose stock price had fallen more than 30 per cent from its 2015 peak. Apple's once-unstoppable growth had come to a crashing halt: the number of iPhones sold was down 13 per cent, and the company posted its first revenue decline in 13 years. Today, Apple's business remains sluggish, but that hasn't stopped investors, including the famously tech-averse Warren Buffett, from falling in love with it again. Shares of the tech giant - the most valuable company in the United States by market value - have repeatedly hit new highs this year. On Friday, they closed at $US143.65, up nearly 60 per cent from last May's trough. What's driving the stock, say sceptics and fans alike, is hope - hope that the new iPhones due in September, after the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone's introduction, will be dazzling enough to inspire existing iPhone users to upgrade and prompt others to switch from Android phones made by Samsung, Huawei and other manufacturers. "Everyone expects Apple to cure cancer with their next product launch," said Kevin Landis, chief executive of Firsthand Funds, who has managed tech-focused mutual funds through many ups and downs. Investors will get more data about Apple's performance, and perhaps some clues about its future, on Tuesday (US time), when the company reports its results for the financial quarter that ended in March. Analysts expect the company to report a slight increase in iPhone sales and overall revenue. Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal says Apple is expected to report that its stockpile of cash has topped a quarter of a trillion [US] dollars, an unrivaled corporate hoard that is greater than the market value of both Wal-Mart and Procter & Gamble and exceeds the combined foreign-currency reserves held by the UK and Canada combined. Apple is expected to make more updates in its next high-end iPhone, including a high-resolution screen that covers the phone's entire face. But the company has also suggested that much of its future growth will come from services like Apple Music, Apple Pay and the cut that Apple takes from application sales and subscriptions in the app store.

Despite uncertainly around foreign investment rules, Chinese companies pumped $15.4 billion into Australian deals last year with commercial property, infrastructure and agriculture the most popular. Now in its sixth year the report, Demystifying Chinese Investment in Australia, found that mining, once the backbone of the investment relationship, had dropped to sixth place with deals worth $839 million last year, down 35 per cent from 2015.  Co-author of the report, Doug Ferguson from KPMG, said Australia's investment relationship with China continued to diversity with a record number of deals in 2016, while more of these than ever before were done by private companies. Just under half the value of Chinese investment in Australia last year was conducted by private companies, although many of these would have received financing from state-owned banks and retained strong links to Beijing. "Despite the impact of uncertainties about Australia's foreign investment review regime, Chinese investment ... continued to diversity and records were smashed," said Mr Ferguson. He said Chinese investment in Australia was starting to "mature" and that parties from the mainland accepted they often needed to form local joint ventures and take minority stakes for high profile deals. This attitude saw property develop Shanghai CRED team-up with Gina Reinehart and accept a minority stake in the purchase of the Kidman cattle empire. But while Australia retains its second place behind the United States in the aggregate value of Chinese investment since 2007, another of the report's co-authors warns that others were catching up. While forecasting strong outbound investment over the longer term, the reported noted efforts by Beijing to moderate capital outflows to keep the yuan relatively strong may impact deals this year. "Real estate, hotels, films, entertainment and sports clubs are among the industries singled out as exhibiting a tendency for 'irrational' overseas investments," the report said. "This is expected to impact investment flows to these sectors in the future." Chinese investment in Australia is at its highest point since the 2008 global financial crisis, according to a new report. Photo: Rolex Dela Pena Back to top 10:33am Shares have shaken off a soft overseas lead to open firmly higher in early trade as investors bet on solid bank results amid a broad uplift. The ASX 200 is up 21 points or 0.3 per cent at 5945 points. Investors are still happy to push banks higher ahead of earnings numbers, Westpac up 0.4 per cent, while ANZ and CBA have added 0.3 per cent. NAB is only marginally higher, while Macquarie continues to push towards its pre-GFC highs, adding another 1.3 per cent. Gains in Woolies, Wesfarmers, Tesltra and CSL are all bolstering the index as it climbs towards 6000 points. Mining and energy stocks are the drags, with BHP off 0.2 per cent, Rio down 0.3 per cent and Rio 1.2 per cent despite Friday night's strong increase in spot iron ore prices. Yesterday's weaker than expected Chinese factory activity indicator may have had something to do with the weakness for the sector. South32 is down 0.5 per cent. In energy, Origin's 1 per cent drop, Santos's 0.7 per cent loss and Oil Search's 0.6 per cent is weighing against the morning's gains. Among the morning's biggest movers is Platinum Asset Mgt, which has dropped 4.4 per cent, while gold miners feature strongly in the best performers. Winners and losers in the ASX 200 this morning. Photo: Bloomberg 10:07am The combined profits of Australia's big four banks likely exceeded $15 billion in the first half, as lenders started to benefit from a round of late 2016 interest rate hikes and strong home loan growth. Big four investors have enjoyed share price gains of more than 6 per cent so far this year, and half-year results from three of the big four in the coming weeks are expected to show profits also ground higher across the industry. Even so, there remains a question mark about whether NAB and Westpac can sustain their dividends, as the industry prepares for looming rules that may force lenders to set aside billions more in capital. ANZ will kick off the half-year bank reporting season tomorrow, with analysts tipping a $3.5 billion cash profit in the six months to March, and a flat interim dividend of 80¢ a share. NAB on Thursday is tipped to deliver earnings of $3.25 billion and also keep its dividend flat. Macquarie Group, whose share price last week closed at $93, not far off its 2007 record high of $97.10, is tipped to deliver a full-year profit of more than $2.1 billion on Friday. That would exceed last year's record of $2.06 billion for the investment bank, which will be among the biggest local winners from promised company tax cuts in the United States. Next week, Westpac's profits are expected to exceed $4 billion and CBA, which reports on June financial year, will post a quarterly update, after it notched up half-year profits of $4.84 billion in February. Profits have likely grown across the industry on the back of housing credit growth of 6.5 per cent in the last six months, analysts believe, propelled by higher house prices in Melbourne and Sydney. There are few signs of distress in banks' loan books, and a round of interest rate hikes targeted at property investors in late 2016 may have also helped earnings. "We expect near-term earnings to be well supported by mortgage repricing benefits, investor-led credit growth, benign credit environment and solid trading income," said Macquarie analyst Victor German.

The market expects solid profit growth when half-year results from ANZ, NAB and Westpac are delivered in May. Photo: Paul Rovere 9:56am on 1 May 2017 Late last week the S&P 500 volatility index, or VIX, hit its lowest level since 2014, and its second lowest level this decade. "The Vix has plummeted below 11, just as we see the big drivers of the rally beginning to lose steam. Indeed, our derivatives strategy team recently noted that several asset classes were pricing a 'world almost free of risk'," a Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategist said in a note late last week. One of your Eds wrote on the topic over the weekend: After years of falling interest rates and central bank support investors have become comfortable buying high and selling higher. Perhaps it's a new bubble: in complacency. What will pop it is anyone's guess. Investors are quick to shrug off worries – France is so last week – and are prepared to buy high in order to sell higher. This is classic bullish behaviour. No surprise there; we are, after all, in a global bull market. Apparently there is no obvious reason for investors to make any dramatic portfolio decisions. Sure, equities are pricey, as are most assets after years of falling rates and central bank bond-buying. But the European Union is not about to break up now that we've decided Le Pen has no chance of winning the second round of French voting. And the global growth upswing is still looking solid. Meanwhile Reuters numbers tell us that listed US companies are having their best quarter of profits since 2011. A global fund manager recently told me that his biggest worry, at least over the short term, was the potential for a big policy mistake in China. The Chinese government has plenty of levers it can pull to maintain growth and stability. The real concern, this fundie said, is that it will pull the wrong ones, or perhaps the right one at the wrong time. That said, a slump on the Shanghai bourse in recent weeks has barely registered globally, despite the falls being driven by a regulatory crackdown on leverage in the Chinese sharemarket. Granted the losses in mainland Chinese shares are not too dramatic, but they have been out of step with the rest of the emerging world, as well as the pro-risk mood more broadly. It suggests investors are not as worried as they were in late 2015 and into 2016 when ham-handed policy interventions sparked a massive wave of anxiety across global markets. Read more at The Financial Review. Investors are apparently not worried about anything much, according to the VIX.  9:44am on 1 May 2017 SPONSORED POST There's something for everyone in markets this week, writes IG strategist Chris Weston: The ASX 200 financial sub-sector needs to hold and build on its break of 7000 and from here make an assault on the 2015 highs which is a mere 2.8% away. Interestingly, the all-time high for the sub-index (from 2007) sits 7.8% away, which seems far more attainable than the broader ASX 200, which needs to appreciate 15.6% to print a new all-time high. The idea of "sell in May and go away" is certainly being talked about, but let's not forget last May the ASX 200 gained 2.4% and despite the average loss over the past decade being 1.6%, most of that can be explained by poor monthly performances in the years between 2010 and 2013. June is actually a far worse month historically to be holding ASX 200 exposure, falling 2.2% on average. We have central bank meetings from the RBA, the Federal Reserve and for FX traders one can also look at the Norges Bank. We have the Fed funds futures pricing at 64% chance of a June hike (from the Federal Reserve), but that pricing mechanism could also easily change given we have pretty much key piece of US economic data being released. Here we see ISM manufacturing (tonight at midnight), core PCE, vehicle sales, services ISM and non-farm payrolls on Friday (consensus 190,000 jobs). We also have the small affair of the French presidential elections on Sunday, and while many see this as a fait accompli, some are showing concern that Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, a first round candidate, has formally endorsed Marine Le Pen and this may provide her with a few extra votes. The market doesn't seem too concerned by this though and still see a fairly comfortable victory for Macron, with implied volatility still subdued and EUR/USD nicely supported into $1.0850. Read more. Play Video Replay Video Will bank earnings drive the ASX 200 towards 6000? With ANZ, NAB, MQG and WBC all reporting earnings in the days ahead, will the numbers and outlook breathe further life into a sector that is clearly outperforming. (This video was produced in commercial partnership between Fairfax Media and IG Markets). 9:37am on 1 May 2017 Photo: CBA Growth in China's manufacturing sector slowed faster than expected in April, an official survey showed on Sunday, as producer price rises lost steam and authorities moved to tackle risks in the property market and credit growth. The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 51.2 in April from the previous month's 51.8, which was the strongest reading since April 2012. Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted a reading of 51.6, the ninth straight month above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. Growth in China's services sector slowed slightly to 54.0 in April, compared with the previous month's reading of 55.1, which was the highest since May 2014. Despite the lower PMI figure, the "drivers of industrial recovery remain intact", CBA China and Asia economist Wei Li said. "We expect industrial production growth to register 6.9 per cent year-on-year in April, compared with an average growth rate of 6.8 per cent in Q1," Li wrote. China's economy grew a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent in the first quarter, boosted by higher government infrastructure spending and a gravity-defying property boom. Chinese leaders have pledged to shift the emphasis to addressing financial risks and asset bubbles, which analysts say pose a threat to the world's second-largest economy if not handed well. President Xi Jinping last week called for increased efforts to ward off systemic risks to help maintain financial security, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Some analysts believe China's economic growth may have peaked in the first quarter but that it's on track to hit a target of around 6.5 per cent this year. CBA's Li is more bullish, forecasting the country's GDP to expand by 6.8 per cent in 2017 - the same pace as last year. China's producer price inflation cooled for the first time in seven months in March as iron ore and coal prices tumbled, while property sales growth slowed in the first quarter despite robust property investment.

With Apple executives Phil Schiller, Craig Federighi, and John Ternus directly stating that the most recent incarnation of the iMac would be released in the near future, speculations and leaks about the upcoming machine have started to gain steam. If these rumors are any indication, it seems that the iMac 2017 would be Apple’s best all-in-one desktop yet. One thing that has caught the attention of numerous Apple fans is the executives’ statement that a powerful iMac “Pro” would be released this year. Federighi even elaborated further, stating that the Cupertino-based tech giant has “put a lot of energy behind” the upcoming server-grade all-in-one desktop, according to a MacWorld report. With these statements in mind, numerous speculations have emerged stating that the iMac Pro 2017, the most powerful variant of the all-in-one desktop, would be released sometime around July to October 2017. Rumors about the device’s launch are many, with some stating that the machine would be launched sometime in Q4 and others predicting that it would launch during WWDC 2017 instead. Overqulified or thorougly upgraded? That's the question!..https://t.co/PlPrTXWZz7#iMac2017 #Apple #rumors pic.twitter.com/9kumVstU2F — iGotOffer (@iGotOffer) April 24, 2017 Considering Apple’s release history, both timelines are possible. The Mac Pro, one of Apple’s most formidable desktops in recent years, was released in WWDC 2013, while the MacBook Pro 2016, the latest line of laptops from the Cupertino-based tech giant, were launched in October. Since the iMac Pro is all but confirmed for a 2017 launch, it appears safe to expect the device to enter the market sometime during the second half of the year. While the release date of the iMac Pro 2017 is all but certain, the features that the upcoming desktop will be equipped with are an entirely different matter. Since its existence was confirmed by Apple, various rumors about the iMac Pro 2017 have emerged, focusing on the device’s processors, memory, and unique features. Needless to say, these recent rumors paint a picture of a formidable computer that appears designed to breeze through any task, regardless of how intensive it might be. The processor of the iMac Pro 2017 has been a focus of rumors over the past few months. While an Intel Kaby Lake chip is all but confirmed for the all-in-one desktop, only a handful of speculations have emerged about the actual processor that the all-in-one would be equipped with. According to a MacRumors report, however, rumors have recently emerged stating that the iMac Pro 2017 would be fitted with a Kaby Lake E3-1200 v6 Xeon processor, a formidable chip that is yet to be shipped by Intel. iZenica is tracing the journey of innovation and the #iMacEvolution! Witness the iMac Retina 5K Display. Visit https://t.co/HZg67X2wIx pic.twitter.com/2WJGf1D3Oc — iZenica (@iZenica) April 30, 2017 Xeon processors are pretty new to the iMac line, considering that only the Mac Pro has used a variant of the chip. Nevertheless, if these rumors prove true, the iMac Pro 2017 would most definitely be a powerhouse. Coupled with a rumored 64GB ECC RAM and up to 2TB of flash storage, the upcoming all-in-one definitely appears to be the machine’s most powerful iteration to date. Another rumored feature of the iMac Pro 2017 that has attracted the attention of numerous Apple fans is its keyboard. The current iMac line uses Apple’s Magic Keyboard 2, which is a capable enough keyboard on its own. For the upcoming iMac Pro 2017, however, rumors have emerged stating that the device would most likely feature a keyboard “with adaptive input.” The actual nature of this particular keyboard remains unknown, though the patent for the accessory suggests a design that is remarkably similar to the MacBook Pro 2016’s Touch Bar. The iMac Pro 2017 is steadily building up to be one of Apple’s most formidable desktop computers. With a renewed sense of purpose in the professional content creation market, the Cupertino-based tech giant definitely appears to be sparing no expense when it comes to the development of one of its most iconic products.

The new program, dubbed OSX/Dok by researchers from Check Point Software Technologies, was distributed via email phishing campaigns to users in Europe. One of the rogue emails was crafted to look as if it was sent by a Swiss government agency warning recipients about apparent errors in their tax returns. The malware was attached to the email as a file called Dokument.zip. What makes OSX/Dok interesting is that it was digitally signed with a valid Apple developer certificate. These certificates are issued by Apple to members of its developer program and are needed to publish applications in the official Mac App Store. Applications signed with an Apple-issued developer certificate can also be installed on the latest versions of macOS without triggering security errors or requiring manual overrides, so it's not hard to see why this would be valuable to a malware program. It's not clear if Dok's creators paid to obtain a developer certificate by joining Apple's developer program with a fake identity or if they stole the certificate from a legitimate developer. Once installed on a Mac, OSX/Dok displays a fake and persistent notification about a system security update that needs to be installed. Users who agree to install the update will be prompted for their administrator password. Once the malware obtains elevated privileges, it will make the active user a permanent administrator so the OS will never ask for the password again when the malware executes privileged commands in the background. Dok will also modify the system's network settings to route web traffic through a proxy server controlled by the attackers andÂ located on the Tor anonymity network. In order for this to work, it also installs a Tor client that's started automatically. The reason why web traffic is routed through a proxy server is to perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack and decrypt secure HTTPS connections. This is achieved by installing a rogue root certificate on the system that is then used to decrypt and re-encrypt HTTPS connections when they pass through the proxy. With this method, users will continue to see the SSL visual indicator in their browser when they access HTTPS websites and the browser will not complain about untrusted certificates. The ability to snoop on HTTPS traffic allows attackers to steal sensitive information like passwords for email; social media and online banking accounts; credit card details entered on shopping websites; personal and financial information entered into web forms; and more. With more than half of all web traffic in an average user's browser now encrypted, it's not surprising that attackers are resorting to man-in-the-middle techniques to capture sensitive data. This and other capabilities make Dok one of the most sophisticated malware programs targetingÂ macOS to date, not counting spy programs created or used by nation states and law enforcement agencies. "We have been and still are in direct contact with Apple [employees] who are very helpful and responsive," Yaniv Balmas, Check Point's malware research team leader, said via email. "With Appleâs cooperation, we believe this specific campaign is now futile and does no longer pose any threat to Mac users." Check Point is looking for related attack campaigns and other possible variants of this malware that might have remained undiscovered until now. "The best way to avoid being infected with this and similar type of malware is to stay alert while opening emails and files from untrusted or unknown sources," Balmas said. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Why peer-to-peer Apple Pay is a great idea Dan Moren 1 May, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News Even in 2017, paying for things is still mostly terrible—even more so now that a multitude of options seem to confront us every time we step up to a register: Do I swipe? Insert my card? Enter a PIN? Sign my name? When Apple Pay launched in 2014, it came with the promise of reducing much of that complexity. Just tap your phone or Apple Watch to the reader and you’re done. That hasn’t exactly panned out, thanks to both the fragmentation of payment methods and less-than-universal adoption of Apple Pay. Still, given the inroads that Apple has made in paying businesses, it’s somewhat surprising that the company hasn’t yet jumped headfirst into person-to-person payments. However, if a report in Recode this week is any indication, Apple may be eyeing just such a move. And the benefits for its users could be tremendous. The pay app gap Recently, a few friends and I went on vacation for a week and a half. Of course, that meant incurring a lot of expenses that were shared among us, so we used the handy Splitwise service to sort them out. But when it comes time to pay, how do you handle that? There are no shortage of services these days: Venmo, PayPal, and Square Cash, just to name a few. The biggest downside with any of those is making sure that the person you want to pay has the same service. If they don’t, you have to go through the whole rigmarole of downloading an app, creating an account, linking it to your payment method, and so on. It’s enough to make you want to pull out the old checkbook. Having person-to-person payments integrated into Apple Pay would make things considerably easier, in the same way that having iMessage built in to iOS simplifies communication: by establishing a standard that anybody with an iPhone or iPad has access to. You wouldn’t have to worry about whether the other party will be able to get your payment. However, like iMessage, such a system would presumably be for Apple customers only. So if you want to fire off payment to an Android-using friend, you’d have to fall back on a third-party service. But to Apple that may not be a problem at all. The company would likely see it as a competitive advantage that will help attract more people to its platform. Dollars and sense The Recode report suggests that Apple’s P2P payment system might work by creating a virtual debit card linked to Apple Pay. (Square Cash has a similar option within its app.) When others send you money, it would be credited to that debit card, which you could then use to purchase things without waiting for money to go through your bank. It’s unclear exactly how the mechanics of the person-to-person transactions would work, but Apple’s existing technology would provide a good foundation. For example, iMessage already has access to your contacts, so Apple could make it easy to attach money to a text message, just as you would a picture or video. Plus, Apple likes to tout iMessage’s end-to-end encryption, which would keep payments secure. Services like Square Cash already let you send payments via iMessage, thanks to the new iMessage apps that debuted in iOS 10, but Apple could no doubt streamline the method even further if it were simply integrating its own services. It could even add an API to allow third-party apps to take advantage of this system. That way, the next time my friends and I use Splitwise to total up what we owe each other, we could just tap a button to have that payment sent via Apple Pay, authenticated via Touch ID. Doesn’t get much easier than that. Paying dividends As for what’s in it for Apple, P2P payments would probably not be a big revenue source for the company. As Recode points out, most of the P2P payment services offered by big companies are free. They’re intended to draw more people to the platform, in the hopes that they’ll move to transactions that are more profitable for those companies, like buying things from companies. Apple certainly doesn’t need to make money from person-to-person money transfers. It’s already pretty comfortable offering free features as incentive for people to buy into its ecosystem. And if the company did offer a debit card that you could then use to, say, pay for iTunes purchases or buy things from Apple, well, that’s just keeping it in the family. More to the point, I think simplifying person-to-person payments—and cutting through the mess of financial institutions—would appeal to Apple’s philosophy of trying to make complicated systems easier to use. Person-to-person payments that don’t involve cash are a pain point that we haven’t really solved yet, and it seems like just the kind of achievement Apple would like to have under its money belt.

By Chris Duckett | May 1, 2017 -- 00:52 GMT (17:52 PDT) | Topic: Mobility Taiwanese electronics giant Foxconn, the maker of Apple iPhones, has announced that it's in talks with the United States government to boost investment there. The world's largest maker of electronic products for international brands said in a statement that it is studying a major expansion in the US. Latest news on Asia India 'anti-colonial' to its economic detriment: Marc Andreessen in incoherent Twitter rant LG Pay will be a no show at MWC: Report Singtel shrinks net profit by SG$16m Facebook withdraws Free Basics project in India Samsung to provide public safety network in South Korea Foxconn Technology Group thanked the White House's Office of American Innovation, created by President Donald Trump and directed by Jared Kushner, for its efforts to pave the way for the company's negotiations with the US government. This statement follows a two-day visit by Foxconn president Terry Gou to the White House. Gou told the media that Hon Hai planned to make a "capital intensive investment" in the US market. "We are planning a series of investments in America. This project will include capital intensive investment and skilled labour and high technology," Gou said. Media in Taiwan said Gou, accompanied by a delegation including Foxconn vice president Tai Jeng-wu, visited the White House and met with Trump. Foxconn in late January said that if its customers like Apple cooperate, it could make investments in the US worth more than $7 billion. Apple makes up approximately half of Foxconn's revenue. The Taiwanese company has manufacturing facilities in China with more than 1 million employees. Foxconn began talks to expand into the US last year, and followed a 2014 examination of a move into the country. Back in November, reports said Apple approached its iPhone manufacturers, Foxconn and Pegatron, to move operations into the US. Foxconn reportedly told Apple that such a move would more than double the cost of an iPhone. At the start of 2016, then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he would force Apple to bring its manufacturing back to the United States, and he would levy a tariff on imports. "We're going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries," Trump said. For 2016, the company announced $136 billion in revenue, a drop of almost 3 percent and its first revenue fall since it went public in 1991. In August last year, Foxconn completed its acquisition of debt-ridden Japanese electronics manufacturer Sharp for around $3.5 billion. As part of the acquisition, Sharp's president and chief executive officer Kozo Takahashi has stepped down from the role, with Tai Jeng-wu, vice chairman of Foxconn, named as his replacement.

Apple Watch Chargers, Docks & Accessories - griffintechnology.com Advertisements Apple Watch is popular with consumers as it helps track their health and fitness levels. Apart from these, the smartwatch is equipped with an SOS feature that can aid one in an emergency as a 22-year-old college student from Maryland discovered recently. For Casey Bennett, his #Apple Watch was literally a life savior when the student met with an unfortunate accident. Advertisements What happened to Bennett? The incident happened on April 6 when Casey was hanging out with his friends. They went to Target and got a bag full of jelly beans before heading toward the campus. After dropping one of his female friends, Casey was driving home when his Jeep was hit by another car.. Advertisements Casey’s vehicle flipped over badly, resulting in the airbags getting deployed. He found himself dangling from the front seat with the seat belt holding him. His iPhone fell from the center console of the jeep, directly on his nose. While he was trying to figure out how to get out from the mangled car, he pressed the side buttons of his Apple Watch for around six seconds. The incident happened near one of the busy intersection in Catonsville. Apple Watch the savior What happened when Casey did this was that the SOS feature on the device activated. It automatically called 911 and the smartwatch also sent a text to all the emergency contacts on his list. Apple Watch informed the recipients about the emergency and his location. According to him, someone else had called 911 and informed them about the accident. After six minutes, the team came to the spot. The firefighters helped him to climb through the sunroof of the tilted jeep and he was taken to the ambulance.. Advertisements The emergency message which was sent from his smartwatch had already alerted his father who was near his home. He rushed to the location to meet him and accompanied Casey to the hospital. Due to the accident, which kept him restrained to the front seat, Casey suffered a bruise on his chest. He also hurt his knees after getting hit by the side door. Emergency feature The emergency SOS feature was introduced for the smartwatch in 2016, with the watchOS 3 update. By holding the side button on the wearable for a few seconds – like Casey did – one can alert 911. One need not go via several apps to alert one’s emergency contact that they are in a concerning situation. After the incident Casey sent a message to Apple’s CEO Tim Cook, thanking him for including the emergency option in the Apple Watch. Apple responded that they were glad he was safe. #Apple Watch Saves Life #Apple Watch Emergency SOS feature Chosen for you Apple is reportedly developing its own smart speaker Xander Juliano Sergio Canavero’s first head transplant patient is a Chinese Vittorio Hernandez The top five most needed apps today Dash Digital Advertisements ﻿ Advertisements Chosen for you Nintendo confirms no live E3 presentation again Arianne Gift Nintendo preparing itself for console domination Vamien Mckalin 'Injustice 2' introduces Brainiac and Darkseid to the supervillain roster Vamien Mckalin Nintendo reveals why NES Classic Edition was discontinued Xander Juliano Blasting SA, IDI CHE-247.845.224, Palazzo Mercurio, Piazza Colonnello Bernasconi 5 - 6830 Chiasso (Switzerland) - © 2013-2022 The Blasting News Data Security and Privacy | Editorial policy | How to contact us About the author of the news Anks Mantri A.

The two go way back; Iovine signed the musician when he was running Interscope Records. The music legend loved will.i.am's idea, a Shark Tank-style competition for new apps, and before long he'd persuaded him and TV producer Ben Silverman to pitch it to Eddy Cue, who runs Apple Inc.'s services business and is the company's conduit to Hollywood.   Will.i.am bailed on a meeting with a TV network and headed for Cupertino, Calif., where he met Cue and soon after agreed to make the program for Apple Music, the tech giant's two-year-old streaming service and an increasingly important part of the Apple universe. With iTunes sales in decline and streaming services such as Spotify on the rise, Apple wants to see if it can turn its music app into a one-stop shop for pop culture—and keep customers tethered to their iPhones.   Iovine said that 'A music service needs to be more than a bunch of songs and a few playlists. I'm trying to help Apple Music be an overall movement in popular culture, everything from unsigned bands to video. We have a lot of plans.'   Apple Music's foray into video programming could be a temporary dalliance, but if Iovine succeeds, the world's wealthiest company could increase its investment, routinely competing for top projects. Iovine added that 'We have the freedom, because it's Apple, to make one show, three shows, see what works, see what doesn't work until it feels good.'     Apple Music could release as many as 10 original series by the end of the year, including will.i.am's Planet of the Apps and several documentaries. Iovine won't say what they are, but people familiar with the matter say two are about the legendary hip-hop labels Bad Boy Records and Cash Money Records while another is about music impresario Clive Davis. 'For a music streaming service," Iovine says, 'we're building a very decent slate.'"   Bloomberg notes later in their report that "Some ideas get Iovine into trouble. He's taken meetings with artists and made arrangements to release music without telling anyone in advance, frustrating colleagues. He's persuaded artists to release music exclusively with Apple, frustrating record labels. But no one doubts his knack for bringing people together.   He met Corden at a party at music manager Guy Oseary's house. Iovine expressed his admiration and asked the late-night comedian to stay in touch. Soon enough, Corden and producer Ben Winston were over at Iovine's house for breakfast. Iovine expressed interest in working together even though Apple wasn't making TV shows at the time. When Carpool Karaoke took off on YouTube—it's been watched more than a billion times—Winston and Corden contemplated a spinoff. So CBS Corp. called Apple, and Winston called Jimmy " – and the rest is history.

By Caitlin McGarry Staff Writer, Macworld | Apr 27, 2017 10:15 AM PT Credit: Apple More like this Why peer-to-peer Apple Pay is a great idea The Week in Apple News and Rumors: Today at Apple, iPhone 8 rumors, ‘Carpool... Report: Apple Pay's Venmo-like feature could be integrated into iMessage Video Hands-on with Apple's new video-editing app, Clips There are already a zillion ways to send money to people: banks, Venmo, Square Cash, Google, and even social networks like Facebook and Snapchat have gotten in on the act. But Apple is reportedly looking to build a money transfer feature into Apple Pay so iPhone users can send money to each other. According to Recode, Apple has been in talks with payment processors and banks about a Venmo-like service for two years, but nothing has happened—yet. Those talks are back on, and we may see an Apple Pay money transfer feature as soon as this year. Apple would approach money transfers a little differently from existing services, Recode reported. In recent talks with Visa, Apple pitched the idea of a prepaid Visa debit card linked to Apple Pay’s wallet—so not physical cards, just digital ones—that would make transferred money immediately available to spend. When you transfer money to a friend with Venmo, for instance, it takes a few days for the cash to clear their bank account. Apple would solve that problem. Venmo Venmo lets you easily transfer money to pay for festival tickets, drinks, and even rent. But it’s unclear if Apple would incentivize Apple Pay users to sign up for yet another card when they already have debit cards with their banks. Recode says those banks are wary of Apple’s money transfer service precisely because of that debit card plan, which would put Apple’s card above existing cards in the Wallet app and position Apple in direct competition with its banking partners. But that’s not necessarily the case, particularly if Apple doesn’t offer any reason to switch cards. iPhone users trust Apple’s dedication to privacy and security and might be more likely to use Apple Pay to transfer money versus a service like Venmo or Square Cash. An Apple Pay money transfer feature would almost certainly boost adoption. While Apple Pay is quick and easy to use for in-store payments, people still aren’t using it very often, at least not in the U.S. They are, however, using Apple Pay to shop online. A money transfer feature would add another element to Apple Pay and increase users’ comfort level with the mobile payment service.

Published on April 27, 2017. 0 Apple iPad Mini 4 with Asus Zenpad 3S 10 are two tablets that have been released in 2015 and 2017, respectively. Today we will compare them and allow you to decide if you should purchase Apple’s “old” tablet or the new one that Asus has just released. Designs The Apple iPad Mini 4 measures 203.2×134.8×6.1mm and weights 299 grams (Wi-Fi) or 304 grams (3G/LTE). Like any other Apple tablet, it has an aluminum body with a minimalistic design, curved edges and a rear camera located in the upper left corner. On the other hand, the Asus Zenpad 3S 10 is thicker and heavier, as it measures 242.3×164.2×6.8mm and weights 490 grams. It’s made of metal, but it has an elegant styling, with double, diamond-cut edges and dual speakers at the bottom. Displays The Apple iPad Mini 4 features a LED-backlit IPS LCD display of 7.9-inch that supports a resolution of 2048×1536 pixels at 324 ppi. The Asus Zenpad 3S 10 has a bigger IPS LCD display of 9.7-inch that supports a resolution of 2048×1536 pixels at 264 ppi. Processors, Graphics Cards & RAM The Apple iPad Mini 4 features an Apple A8 chipset, a dual-core Typhoon processor clocked at 1.5GHz, a PowerVR GX6450 graphics card and 2GB of RAM. The Asus Zenpad 3S 10 has a more powerful Qualcomm MSM8956 Snapdragon 650 chipset, a quad-core Cortex A53 processor clocked at 1.4GHz and a dual-core Cortex A72 processor clocked at 1.8GHz, an Adreno 510 graphics card and 4GB of RAM. Storages The Apple iPad Mini 4 has been released in four storage variants of 128GB, 64GB, 32GB and 16GB, which you are not able to expand. On the other hand, the Asus Zenpad 3S 10 comes with an internal storage of only 32GB, but don’t worry because you are able to expand it up to 256GB using a microSD card. Cameras Both tablets sport a primary camera of 8MP that features geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, HDR and panorama. However, the Apple iPad Mini 4 has a weaker secondary camera of only 1.2MP when compared to the 5MP one that the Asus Zenpad 3S 10 features. Batteries The Apple iPad Mini 4 is powered by a non-removable battery of 5124 mAh, which is weaker than the non-removable battery of 7800 mAh that the Asus Zenpad 3S 10 has.

Nicholas Gray, The Australian’s CEO, said the service did not drive subscriptions or revenue. “The Australian’s number one digital priority is driving subscriptions, and unfortunately the Apple News service did not drive meaningful new subscriptions, nor meaningful revenue, for us. We had no reason to believe this was going to change any time soon,” he said. According to the most recent audited figures, The Australian has 83,833 digital subscriptions. The news comes just a week after The Guardian withdrew from Apple News and Facebook Instant Articles. Nicholas Gray: The Apple News service did not drive meaningful new subscriptions, nor meaningful revenue, for us Gray announced The Australian was launching subscriber content on Apple News at Mumbrella’s Publish conference in September last year, telling the room the News Corp brand had previously made the conscious decision to stay away from Apple News, Facebook Instant Articles or Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages platforms, and instead concentrate on paid content rather than reach. “It is an inescapable truth that these three companies have created technology which has reshaped the world. They are all, after all, incredibly impressive global organisations with excellent consumer experiences and who have created compelling network effects and they have generated two trillion Australian dollars of market cap, that is the equivalent of our nation’s entire superannuation pool, between them,” he said. As of today, The Australian will only distribute a limited number of unrestricted, publicly available stories on Apple News. Impacted subscribers have been pointed towards The Australian’s mobile and tablet apps where all subscriber-only stories will be available. The broadsheet has never used Facebook Instant Articles while the only content from the publication available through Google AMP is content that is not behind The Australian’s paywall.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Apple announces environmental progress in China Lens Technology has committed to power all of its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by the end of 2018, as part of Apple’s industry-leading supply chain clean energy program announced last year. Lens is the first supplier to make a clean energy commitment for all of its Apple production, and will meet its goal through an unprecedented power purchase agreement with local wind projects. Apple is working with suppliers to help transform the environmental landscape in China, and is proud to announce all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The UL standard certifies all of their manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or, when necessary, converted into energy. Since the program began in January 2015, the sites have diverted more than 140,000 metric tons of waste from landfills. “We want to show the world that you can manufacture responsibly and we’re working alongside our suppliers to help them lower their environmental impact in China,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. “We congratulate Lens for their bold step, and hope by sharing the lessons we’ve learned in our transition to renewable energy, our suppliers will continue to access clean power projects, moving China closer to its green manufacturing goals.” “Our power purchase agreement is the first of its kind in southern China and we hope it will serve as an example for other companies looking to transition to cleaner, more economical sources of power,” said Lens CEO Zhou Qunfei. “We’re pleased to be the first supplier to commit to covering all of our Apple production with renewable energy, and proud to source from local Hunan wind farms to power our facilities in Changsha.” Lens’ manufacturing with Apple currently includes two facilities in Changsha, Hunan province. Wind energy will cover 100 percent of the energy consumed producing Apple products at Lens facilities by 2018, avoiding nearly 450,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, equivalent to the energy use in 380,000 Chinese homes.

ST FILE PHOTO Singapore AS Apple Pay marked its first anniversary in Singapore in April, observers said that mobile payments have in the last year gained significant traction here, with the real power of mobile wallets now going beyond just payments. They are rich customer engagement platforms. Forrester analyst Ng Zhi Ying told The Business Times that Apple Pay's launch had triggered the other mobile payment providers Samsung Pay and Android Pay to rapidly roll out such services in Singapore in 2016 - offering consumers here a plethora of mobile payment choices. Ms Ng said: "Today, an increasing number of Singaporean consumers are getting more familiar and comfortable with paying with their mobile phones, enjoying the convenience of not having to pay with their wallets." sentifi.com Market voices on: Piruze Sabuncu, head of South-east Asia at payments company Stripe, said that Apple Pay has enjoyed quick adoption in Singapore as it reduces "all the friction" to making purchases on mobile devices, and enables secure transactions for both consumers and businesses. SEE ALSO: S-E Asia a 'homogeneous' region for startup investing "Mobile conversions are a challenge for most businesses. While mobile constitutes 60 per cent of online browsing, it accounts for only 15 per cent of purchases. Cumbersome mobile checkout flows are the worst offenders, requiring customers to pick out a zillion credit card and shipping details to complete a purchase." Apple Pay considerably improves the online purchase experience for both consumers and businesses by allowing the entire checkout process to be completed with a "simple tap of the thumb", Ms Sabuncu said. She shared that retailers last year reported that Apple Pay users were 92 per cent more likely to complete a transaction. Indiegogo saw its conversion rates grow by 2.5 times after introducing Apple Pay, while Instacart said that its customers checked out 58 per cent faster using Apple Pay. Eric Gnock Fah, co-founder of travel concierge app Klook, said that as a mobile-first platform that focuses on travel activities and services, payment partners such as Apple Pay play an important role in "facilitating bookings" for Klook customers both pre- and in-destination. For one thing, Klook users can instantly access and book activities such as a ride on the Hong Kong Airport Express, as well as last-minute skip-the-queue tickets outside Universal Studios Japan - by just using Apple Pay, he said. He added: "Speed and mobility are simply too important to ignore in today's fast-paced environment, where customers demand instant fulfilment and flexibility." Ernest Sim, chief technology officer of local healthy food startup Grain, affirmed that integrating Apple Pay onto its platform has been good for the business. "The implementation helps remove at least two taps off our checkout experience, and allows customers to have a more seamless checkout experience." Mr Sim also noted that the integration of Apple Pay - which Stripe helped Grain do - was "really simple". He said: "We ran an extremely lean tech team of only two people then, and the ease in developer integration freed up valuable time that could be better concentrated on core business features." Forrester's Ms Ng pointed out that aside from Apple, Samsung and Android, a few companies have started experimenting with mobile contactless payments with wearables, such as EZ-Link's Garmin smartwatch. The research house believes that the real power of mobile wallets lies beyond just mobile payments. A new study by senior analyst Wang Xiaofeng found that while mainstream Western mobile wallets primarily focus on payments, pioneer mobile wallets in China have taken aggressive steps and become powerful customer engagement tools. Ms Wang cited WeChat's social gifting service, as well as Alipay's augmented reality (AR) coupons and red packets. "Their mobile wallet innovations span the customer life cycle." She added that market-entry obstacles such as dissimilar business cultures, consumer behaviours and regulations make it unlikely that Alipay and WeChat will operate directly in other markets beyond targeting Chinese travellers. "Mobile wallet players have been inspired by the success of Alipay and WeChat wallets. Emerging mobile wallets like PayTM in India already look like early versions of Alipay. We expect other third-party players like Apple and PayPal to morph their mobile wallets into more powerful customer engagement platforms." Meanwhile, activity in the mobile payment space continues apace. Last month, Alibaba's financial affiliate Ant Financial said that it has acquired Singapore-based helloPay, as part of efforts to boost its Alipay brand and presence in South-east Asia. helloPay is the payment subsidiary of e-commerce firm Lazada Group (which, after a US$1-billion deal last year, is majority-owned by Alibaba) and will be rebranded as Alipay. apple pay samsung pay android pay mobile payment startups Singapore startups Purchase this article as republication.

Now, the Cupertino computing giant is giving customers an extra two years of coverage in case that expensive watch face pops off. Owners Of The Fourth Generation iPad Could Get An Upgrade If They Need Service If you've held back on getting the latest iPad since 2012's fourth generation, you could be in luck. According to an internal memo obtained by 9to5 Mac, users who need service on that model could walk out of the store with a shiny new iPad Air 2. Read more It's unknown just how widespread the battery swelling issue is. Users have reported issues and posted photos on Reddit, Apple's official support forums, and Twitter. Here's what it looks like when that battery swells up. Beware of exploding #AppleWatch! After 6 months the screen randomly popped off while wearing the watch- @Apple HK blamed a "swollen battery" pic.twitter.com/7qxtHw7Zje — Stephanie Linker (@steph_linker) April 16, 2017 An internal email to Apple Authorised Service Providers was first obtained by 9to5 Mac that notifies specialists of the warranty extension. The full warranty will now cover the Apple Watch for three years instead of one. That's just in time for the second anniversary of the first generation of the device. Since Apple has not made a formal announcement to consumers, the battery swelling issue is not believed to be widespread. It appears that the company is simply playing it safe and getting ahead of any negative reports by ensuring that a repaired or replacement device will be available for anyone who experiences that telltale cracking in the display. Users should not necessarily be worried about Samsung Note 7 style explosions. Battery swelling can be caused by overcharging, overheating, and other damage that occurs. It doesn't appear that the Apple Watch will suddenly set your wrist on fire. So, if you have an Apple Watch that's getting older or is already broken, you may have just gotten a new lease on its life. [Apple Insider, 9to5 Mac] Comments Almost Guest May 1, 2017, 10:20am If I spent a lot of money on a watch and the face fell off of it after a year I wouldn't be celebrating the warranty. I would go to the store to return is and to ask for a refund on an obviously poorly made device. I don't mean to sound like a troll but to me the square watch design with rounded corners is so "last year". Reply 1 baabaa5 Guest May 1, 2017, 12:58pm the battery may be swelling but its not from being able to hold a charge. Reply 0 WiseHacker @wisehacker May 1, 2017, 3:04pm Seems to be a common theme with Apple. Last year, I had the battery in my first ever MacBook Pro (2011 model from memory) for the same reason. The battery swelled up and was forcing the track pad out of the housing. But this is just insane. What is it about batteries of late that has Apple and even Samsung getting it wrong?! It's 2017, batteries are not new tech and they should have processes in place to check the chemical formulation to find these problems long before they go to market. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

Samsung Galaxy S8: The Gizmodo Review Mario Aguilar 30 Apr 2017 7:00 AM With the exploding Note7 battery fiasco, Samsung inadvertently did something that's increasingly difficult these days. It made smartphones interesting for a flickering moment. Super interesting, in fact. Besides the intrigue of the mournful saga of Note7, whose embarrassing recall cost the company billions, Samsung also set up a dramatic release narrative for the Galaxy S8. This wasn't just another smartphone -- this was a make-or-break device charged with saving a company in the throes of an existential crisis. A smartphone that screams at the void -- yikes!

One of the reasons is because consumers are reportedly getting “bored” of the iPhone, which isn’t helped by the fact that Apple has used the same design for the past three iPhone generations which doesn’t exactly make for a compelling reason to upgrade. However it is possible that for some reason the decline might have stopped. According to the latest numbers from the IDC, it turns out that Apple’s iPhone sales for the first quarter of 2017 has actually remained relatively flat and it might have also increased marginally. The IDC claims that Apple shipped 51.6 million iPhones in Q1 2017, versus Q1 2016 where they shipped 51.2 million. However overall market share for Apple’s iPhones has dropped from 15.4% the same period last year, down to 14.9% in the first quarter of 2017. Continuing to lead the way is Samsung whose shipments have remained flat, but is still way ahead of Apple at 79.2 million shipments and a 22.8% market share in Q1 2017. We’re also seeing Chinese OEMs catching up with Huawei increasing their market share from 8.4% last year to 9.8% this year, Oppo from 5.9% to 7.4%, and Vivo from 4.4% to 5.2%. That being said, next year’s numbers could be drastically different as many are expecting Apple to enjoy a supercycle with the rumored iPhone 8. Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about iPhone.

Apple’s once-unstoppable growth had come to a crashing halt: the number of iPhones sold was down 13 per cent, and the company posted its first revenue decline in 13 years.Today, Apple’s business remains sluggish, but that hasn’t stopped investors, including the famously tech-averse Warren Buffett, from falling in love with it again. Shares of the tech giant – the most valuable company in the United States by market value – have repeatedly hit new highs this year.

After watching iPad unit sales spiral downward for 12 quarters in a row, the company introduced a cheaper model in March to win over schools that were flocking to Chromebooks. Apple is also likely to update its Pro models for businesses this year. Apple also admitted that the striking cylindrical design of the Mac Pro, a personal computer that is important to its most demanding customers, turned out to be a mistake that limited its upgrade potential. A completely redesigned Mac Pro will be released next year, Apple executives said in early April during an unusual meeting with tech journalists to discuss the computer's shortcomings. "We made something bold that we thought would be great for the majority of our Mac Pro users - and what we discovered was that it was great for some and not others," Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president for marketing, said at the meeting. "We're sorry for that, what happened with the Mac Pro, and we're going to come out with something great to replace it." 'Wringing their hands' Investors appear to be relieved that Apple sales have stabilised after last year's drop, said Neil Cybart, an independent analyst who writes about Apple at the website Above Avalon. "There is at least increased confidence in what Apple can do in the future," he said. Kevin Walkush, a portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management who loaded up on Apple shares near last year's lows, is one of those confident investors. "Apple is turning into the big Caddy that's going to cruise down the freeway, and there's a certain class of investors that are really comfortable with that - and we're that kind of investor," he said. Heavy buying of Apple shares by Mr Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, and by Apple itself has also helped support the stock price, accounting for one month's trading volume in the shares, according to Mr Cybart's calculations. Berkshire is now Apple's fifth-largest shareholder, owning 2.61 per cent of the company as of February 27. In recent years, as United States phone carriers have stopped subsidising the purchase of new phones, consumers have been holding on to their old smartphones longer than the typical two-year upgrade cycle. The last time that Apple made big changes to its phone lineup was in 2014, when it first introduced models with larger screens. Expectations are high that the new iPhones coming out this year will have enough improvements to prompt a big wave of new purchases. "People are excited about a feature-rich launch," said Timothy Arcuri, a technology analyst at Cowen & Company. But as Apple pushes the innovation envelope, there are risks. The company has been having difficulty with the new type of fingerprint reader needed for its most advanced iPhone, which is expected to have a screen that runs edge to edge, with no physical home button, Mr Arcuri said. He said Apple had just a few more weeks to work out the kinks if it hoped to meet its traditional September release date. Otherwise, it will have to delay the new phones or put the fingerprint reader on the back of the phone — a clunky solution adopted by Samsung for its Galaxy S8 phone that has been panned by reviewers. "They're wringing their hands," Mr Arcuri said of Apple. Even if Apple's new iPhones fail to deliver a large sales increase, investors are also hoping for changes in tax law that will benefit Apple. Last week, the Trump administration proposed a broad-based cut in the corporate tax rate and hinted at a possible tax break for profits held overseas that could prompt Apple to bring back tens of billions of dollars in foreign profits and distribute them to shareholders. Potential breakthroughs are also in the works. The company is developing augmented reality technology, including eyeglasses, that will overlay real objects with digital ones. Some expect a rudimentary form of augmented reality to show up in the next iPhone. And two weeks ago, Apple received a permit from California regulators to begin testing self-driving cars on public roads. Technological leaps like those would win back sceptics like Mr Landis. "History says that Apple does great but they never shake up the world," he said. "I need them to surprise me." magazine.afr.com The New York Times Share Share via Email Share on Google Plus Post on facebook wall Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit Advertisement Advertisement Related articles Apple patents Wi-Fi charging for iPhones How Apple nearly banned Uber from its store Apple Maps update helps electric car drivers Apple readies iPhone overhaul Apple mulls chipmaking acquisition Latest Stories ASX see-saws higher 3 mins ago Contains: Video China's ENN and Hony muscle up on Santos 3 mins ago How to get enough income to retire 3 mins ago More Advertisement Australia's 50 biggest private philanthropists Giving back to society Meet the 2017 Bulgari Art Award winner The family battle behind the sale of the Kidman empire Why a $350 wine needs a backstory Where the business crowd meets in Hanoi How big companies keep their top performers Dame of Drones' advice for emerging leaders The Wolf of Wall St Corporate stupidity and what to do about it The best new (and fun) luxury gifts David Umemoto's meditations in concrete Travel tip: forget travelling light Coffee a star ingredient in Tokyo fine dining Look inside the best Australian properties Special Reports PRRT changes kicked down the road Five key steps in the life cycle of a vehicle Charting the best maintenance method debatable City of Spectres Telematics industry changing tack Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd © Copyright 2017 Reprints & Permissions Privacy Policy Terms & Conditions of Use Experience afr.com free for 1 month Enjoy unlimited access to Australia's best business news and market insights across desktop, tablet and mobile Find out more Already a subscriber?

The evolving compendium of the English language has garnered headlines recently with its social media swipes at the Trump administration. And now, the dictionary is trolling Apple fans by using them as an example of the term "sheeple". Photo: Getty A Ton Of People Are Looking Up The Definition Of 'Fascism' For Some Reason Read more According to Merriam-Webster: Damn, shots fired. Knowing the ways in which Apple fanboys-and-girls just repeat each other's talking points, this won't go over well. Obviously, Webster's dictionary is living in the past, a time when headphone jacks existed and USB ports were a must-have on a laptop. All kidding aside, I have to say that I switched to PC late last year after being an Apple fanboy for years and I've regretted the decision. Macs are still more convenient and more secure than Windows-based desktops. The gap has gotten smaller but a Mac still just works in a way that PCs don't. What do you PC people have to say to that?! @Tunrip @LauraMullan "Oh but apple products just work" So does every other gadget you sheeple and for cheaper. — Just call me puss™ (@hornblower72) April 25, 2017 Oh. If the decision to throw a trolling example into the definition was Merriam-Webster's attempt at grabbing attention it seems to have worked. But with Alex Jones getting a lot of press lately, the dictionary's PR team seems to have missed out on a perfect opportunity.

This also led me to believe alot of these people just get iphones because its an iphone. not blaming them for not caring but its certainly indicative of the sheeple mentality. Reply 1 WiseHacker @wisehacker May 1, 2017, 3:44pm My first iPhone was a 3GS. I just wanted something to combine my phone and my iTunes library. But I bailed after the iPhone 5. iOS was just a shadow of what it was (screw iOS 7 an later!) and the hardware just didn't feel as well planned out as the prior model. It didn't have the retina display, but I still think the best model was the 3GS. These days, I use an Oppo. Android may have started out as an unethical clone of iOS (hear me out!), but rather than see it as competition, Apple clogged up the courts and let their competitive edge fall to their main (copy cat) competitor. And to make it further clear, I like ColorOS; it is now what iOS used to be. Reply 1 xaqq @xaqq May 1, 2017, 1:31pm "Macs are still more convenient and more secure than Windows-based desktops". "Convenient" is a completely subjective/personal thing. You came from a Mac background so it set your paradigm and you still find it more convenient. At least you disclosed your bias and held out your hand for the trolls to bite :). "More secure" could be argued but I think the argument is a largely moot. Unless you are being incredibly lax with your security you should not have issues. As for the overall "Apple users are sheeple " thesis I think that is the core (geddit) of Apples business model. They know that the majority of their users will stick within the Apple umbrella of products and don't often don't innovate are offer good value. One area I used to praise Apple was their quality assurance and testing process ("it just works"), however they seem to have stumbled in this are quite a bit over the past couple of years. Reply 1 WiseHacker @wisehacker May 1, 2017, 3:40pm "More secure" could be argued Doesn't need to be. Macs have a history at the Pwn2Own (?) conference (and others) as being the first platform to fall. I also happen to be a Mac user and I can safely say that code wise Macs can be insecure. A security flaw was found in NTP at least a year ago and when I checked my system last time I found it still has not been updated. Reply 1 Join the discussion!

Samsung Galaxy S8: The Gizmodo Review Mario Aguilar 30 Apr 2017 7:00 AM With the exploding Note7 battery fiasco, Samsung inadvertently did something that's increasingly difficult these days. It made smartphones interesting for a flickering moment. Super interesting, in fact. Besides the intrigue of the mournful saga of Note7, whose embarrassing recall cost the company billions, Samsung also set up a dramatic release narrative for the Galaxy S8. This wasn't just another smartphone -- this was a make-or-break device charged with saving a company in the throes of an existential crisis. A smartphone that screams at the void -- yikes!

KOLKATA: Apple's iconic offline stores in India is still far away, with the company first planning to set up its own online store by this year piggy-riding on the fact that local manufacturers can have a direct online presence in the country. Apple will initially start its online store by selling iPhone SE which will be manufactured in India and the product portfolio will be expanded as it grows the local production to other models. Two senior industry officials said Apple's online store plans does not require foreign direct investment (FDI) approval in retail since the government allows companies to directly sell online models manufactured locally. The company plans to start assembling of iPhones in Bengaluru by June. "Apple will initially start its online store by selling iPhone SE which will be manufactured in India and will be in line with government policies. The company is hopeful to start the online store in India around Diwali," said one of the executive. It may also sell some accessories which will be sourced from India. For Apple, around 50-55 per cent of the iPhones sold in India is generated from online sales as compared to the smartphone industry average of 30 per cent. Apple will not compete on price with online marketplaces for the products it sells through its own online store. Instead, Apple plans to differentiate its online store in India from marketplaces like Amazon and Flipkart by offering value-added services such as laser engraving to personalise the handset, sell models or variants which are exclusive such as a dedicated model, colour option or storage space, the executive said. An email sent to Apple did not elicit any response till Sunday press time. Globally, Apple operates its online store in 39 countries including several of them which do not have the companyowned offline stores which is present in about 20 countries. The brick-and-mortar Apple Stores in India will be limited in number and the company is looking at 4-5 such flagship outlets over the next 5-10 years. This is due to the fact that such stores require huge space to suit its architectural design and comes up over iconic locations which are far and few. The offline Apple Stores will initially come up in the metroes. Apple's local assembling will start with the iPhoneSE through Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron's facility in Bengaluru. The company has plans to scale it up to few other iPhone models and is also open to start with its other global partner Foxconn which is already operating couple of plants in the country. There are plans to set up a full-fledged manufacturing operation in the country including its component manufacturer base and has sought tax exemptions from the government for that. The government is yet to give its approvals on the concessions sought.

By Rene Ritchie Sunday, Apr 30, 2017 at 9:00 am EDT 98 Comments Do you need AppleCare+ for your Apple Watch or is standard AppleCare enough? Here's the deal! For Apple Watch and Apple Watch Nike+, the free level of AppleCare includes a one-year limited warranty on hardware repairs and 90 days of free technical support. AppleCare+ extends the hardware warranty and technical support to two years and adds coverage for up to two incidents of accidental damage — though there's an additional service fee for those. Apple Watch Hermès and Apple Watch Edition come with two years standard but can be extended to three years with the same two incidents. But is it worth it? AppleCare vs. AppleCare+ AppleCare+ extensions AppleCare+ service fee Who shouldn't get AppleCare+? Who should get AppleCare+? AppleCare vs. AppleCare+ Anyone and everyone who buys an Apple Watch or Apple Watch Nike+ from Apple automatically gets the standard level of AppleCare for free, which includes: 1 year limited hardware warranty 90 days of free technical support Anyone and everyone who buys an Apple Watch Hermès or Apple Watch Edition from Apple also automatically gets the standard level of AppleCare for free, though it lasts much longer: 2 years limited hardware warranty 2 years of free technical support That means, if you run into problems setting up or using your Apple Watch during the first three months of ownership (two years for Apple Watch Hermès or Edition), you can call 1-800-APL-CARE and they'll help you troubleshoot. If any part of the device fails during the first year (two years for Apple Watch Hermès or Edition), and it's not due to accidental or intentional damage, Apple will likewise replace it. For example, if the digital crown stops spinning or the screen won't come on, you're covered. If you drop it and break it or take it in the swimming pool and short it out, you're on your own. Unless you have AppleCare+. AppleCare+ extensions For an additional fee, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Nike+ provides the following: 2 years limited hardware warranty 2 years of free technical support 2 incidents of accidental damage (subject to a $69 service fee) Apple Watch Hermès and Apple Watch Edition get: 3 years limited hardware warranty 3 years of free technical support 2 incidents of accidental damage (subject to a $79 service fee) This way, you get technical support from 1-800-APL-CARE for two full years (three years for Apple Watch Hermès or Edition), and if the strap mechanism gets stuck or the side button gets loose, and it's not due to accidental or deliberate damage, Apple will likewise replace it for two years (three years for Apple Watch Hermès or Edition). But if it is due to accidental damage, like dropping and cracking the screen or soaking and shorting the electronics, Apple will still replace it, up to twice, for the cost of the service charge. AppleCare+ service fee If you use either of the two accidental damage incidents that come with AppleCare+, there's an additional charge. Currently, that charge is: $69 for Apple Watch or Apple Watch Nike+ $79 for Apple Watch Hermès or Apple Watch Edition Perhaps Hermès bands and ceramic are slightly more expensive to service? AppleCare+ vs. credit card benefits Some credit cards offer warranty extensions as an incentive to use them for major electronic purchases. For example, some cards will offer an additional year of coverage — provided by the credit card company, not the vendor — on any purchase made on that card. Some will even cover loss or theft, which is not covered by AppleCare+. If you don't want to pay extra for AppleCare+ and don't mind how the credit card companies handle the extra year of coverage, it's something to consider. Just check your policy carefully and make sure you're fully informed about not only what they cover but how they cover it. Who shouldn't get AppleCare+? If you're tight on cash and simply can't afford it, if you consider yourself exceptionally lucky and have never had a new device fail or get damaged, if you have added protection from your credit card company or another source, or if you plan to buy additional or updated Apple Watches so frequently you doubt anything bad will ever have time to happen, then you might not want to get AppleCare+. Who should get AppleCare+? If you don't mind paying for peace of mind, if you often find devices fail on you or you're always dropping or otherwise damaging them, if you don't have or don't trust credit card company protection, or if you plan to keep your Apple Watch for more than a year, then you might want to get AppleCare+.

I've only needed it once though. I work in a less and perfect environment for an Applewatch, I've hit the watch off concrete hard enough to bruise my wrist underneath, caught the watch against a metal ridge on a wall on site (thought I had really damaged the watch, the sound of the screen grinding on the metal was audible) yet the the watch is still perfectly fine, I'm sure if I used a strong lease I would find signs of damage but it's not noticeable. Would I get Applecare for another Applewatch or any other Apple device in the future? Yes. Sure the chance of the watch failing in the 2 years is low but "I likes my security blankets". 0 2 hours ago Reply iFloridawi I have Apple Care+ for my Apple Watch 1st Gen. My screen has been broken when it felt on the floor. I took it to 3 Apple stores and all said it takes 5-10 days to replace it with a new unit since it's very damaged and can not be fixed! I don't know what is the adding value or the point of buying something you can not use it? It's been 5 months and still can't replace it due to being in a location doesn't have Apple retail store! Thus, if I am going to buy Apple watch again I don't think I will add Apple Care! 0 6 months ago Reply puggsly I have to cry BS! Apple's policy in these cases is to replace the device on the spot with a new/refurbished watch, and even if for some reason they didn't have the replacement watch they would ship it to you or tell you to send the watch into Apple for mail in service. You can opt to mail in (free of charge) your product over the phone. Apple will ship you an overnight box and return it in a similar overnight box. normally you see the product back in 3-5 days via mail in. Finally, Apple is far from the only place you can take in an Apple watch for AppleCare service. Most if not all best buy stores and thousands of independent Apple authorized service centers can handle it. So if you sat on a broken Applewatch for 5 months that was covered under AppleCare plus? You are not the sharpest knife in the drawer. 0 8 hours ago Reply talha wahid Great Info, But i think it costs more than people expect from Apple, Here is a Brief Preview of Apple Watch http://techfumes.com/apple-watch-release-date/ 0 2 years ago Reply CNJBrownBear I put a tweet out to SquareTrade to ask if they had plans to cover AppleWatch and they alluded that something is in the works. https://twitter.com/SquareTrade/status/578700160382971904. While I do have AppleCare on my iMac 5K, I've gone with SquareTrade for my iOS devices and MacBook Air. Sent from the iMore App 0 2 years ago Reply Serajfarabi Just an additional note as someone who buys AppleCare but upgrades frequently, if you're like me you can call AppleCare after you recycle/sell/hand off your previous device if the new owner didn't want AppleCare or you're trading into Apple and they'll prorate you the remaining amount on your protection plan. I've gotten up to 50-60 back when I traded in my 5S and bought a 6+ Sent from the iMore App 0 2 years ago Reply sweetstyle didn't realise that was the case, I will look into this... 0 2 years ago Reply Ttrq2001 AppleCare Plus coverage is probably pretty much a mandatory requirement if you're going to own one of these watches and want to protect your investment...it's not like you will be able to take your Apple Watch into your local watchmaker for repair like you can with high-end Swiss watches. The only option is to pretty much return to the Apple Store for limited repairs or have the store send the watch back to an Apple Service Center for a more complex repair (actually, this is very common for upper-end Swiss watches). Although, it remains to be seen what the coverage schemes and repair/replacement fees will be for accidental damage. And something else to consider is whether the major watch and jewelry insurance firms will elect to provide coverage for the Apple Watch or even if you homeowners insurance company will allow you to add coverage for the Apple Watch. For serious watch collectors, having appropriate insurance coverage is mandatory to cover theft and "mysterious disappearance" which AppleCare Plus or credit card insurance won't cover. BTW, one other thing that nobody is talking about is the use of the Apple Watch in contacts sports. It could very well likely be banned for use during competition in many contact sports as obviously it is just too bulky to have on your wrist during competition and risk potentially hurting yourself or a competitor or teammate flopping your arms around. There is a reason why the small, lightweight Fitbits have become so popular and the Apple Watch in it's current incarnation can't replace them. Also, who is going to want to put their Apple Watch back on their wrist for a formal event or even daily wear after scratching up the case and crystal and smelling up the watch band during exercise. Watch geeks have multiple watches and there is a reason why we like the Fitbits so much. It's not practical to have a single watch for all usages. 0 2 years ago Reply suitcasejohnny Sorry, I meant "overpriced luxury item." :) 0 2 years ago Reply suitcasejohnny If you can't afford AppleCare, why are you spending your limited money on an Apple Watch?? Save for your future, people! Pay of some debts! Do something other than spending an obscene amount of money on a luxury item. In other words, use some common sense. 0 2 years ago Reply jalexand007 Almost everything we own is a luxury item. I know some people go crazy with stuff but Apple-Care for most people on the comments proof to not pay off so it is not worth the cost. 0 2 years ago Reply Gazoobee I think you are making WAY too many assumptions about other folks here. I will be buying the Apple Watch even though it's expensive ($2,000!), but it will be LESS money than my next door neighbour spends on hockey tickets each year, LESS money than my friend spends to keep her car running for even half a year, LESS money than others might spend on booze or even eating out for a single year. You see the way that works? We all actually have DIFFERENT lives, and spend money on DIFFERENT things. Just because you don't want to buy one, doesn't mean it's a bad decision for someone else. It might be the most cost effective thing they bought all year, and their "luxury" spending overall might even be LESS than yours. 1 2 years ago Reply suitcasejohnny I didn't say, don't buy the watch. I said, if you can't afford AppleCare, why are you spending your limited money on the watch?? Obviously, if you can spend upwards of $1000, you can probably shoot the works and get AppleCare. This was in reference to the part in the article about Who Shouldn't Get AppleCare. "If you're tight on cash and simply can't afford it." Well, if that's your situation, you probably aren't, or shouldn't, get an Apple Watch. That's common sense, people. Use it. 0 2 years ago Reply Essayons Solutions Two minutes ago, you were talking about Edition buyers, weren't you? 0 2 years ago Reply suitcasejohnny No, I wasn't... 0 2 years ago Reply bikewolf The idea of getting AppleCare for the AppleWatch seems unnecessary. After watching the videos, it would appear that they are using highly durable materials. I've never had a glass watch crack. Other things have broken, such as bands and hand markers. But never my glass. The only reason I would consider it is because the glass off the Apple Watch juts out more than other watches. Accidents happen, but I would hope that the materials are durable enough to survive average use. Now if Apple added a free battery replacement or AppleCare+ for longer than two years, I'd be interested. I'm still really hoping that they announce some type of plan that will increase the longevity of this product. 1 2 years ago Reply freediverx As someone who wears a watch all the time, I can attest to the fact that they can be subjected to quite a bit of impact in regular usage. My watch holds up just fine but only time will tell if Apple has built their watch with comparable ruggedness. As far as AppleCare goes, I doubt it will be a good deal. The tricky part is that we have no idea what if anything is likely to break and what the out of warranty repair cost would be. 0 2 years ago Reply jalexand007 I agree. When I used to wear a watch I would put it through hell and back and never broke a watch. I went for 25 years without a damaged watch. 0 2 years ago Reply Essayons Solutions And when I was in the Army, I'd go thru a G-Shock a year. Guess "hell" is a relative term. Sappers lead the way! 0 2 years ago Reply jalexand007 True. 0 2 years ago Reply dstrauss As a long time (30 years +/-) Seiko wearer, I'd agree that crystals are pretty sturdy, but I do worry about the flexible OLED they are using with the Watch to enable force touch - that sounds more delicate than a standard screen. 0 2 years ago Reply iPandorum Yes you should get it! Helps with the resell value when you advertise it has apple care on the iOS device as well! With this being a 1st gen I don't feel like running into problems after 30 days or even 1 year. I'd rather have peace of mind! Sent from the iMore App 0 2 years ago Reply jalexand007 That might depend on where you are selling it. I have never been asked if my device as AppleCare. If you go through Gazelle or a similar service that is not a concern. 0 2 years ago Reply iPandorum I usually sell on EBay or Amazon And from experience if you advertise it that device will go for 20%-30% more in my experience. Everyone loves that "piece of mind" Sent from the iMore App 0 2 years ago Reply jalexand007 Glad it works in your favor. I bought Apple Care once then found out for me it was not worth it. Never kept a phone for more that 2 years. 0 2 years ago Reply drewsammie Like my phone I'll just get a great case. -1 2 years ago Reply Gazoobee Cases for a watch are just ridiculous IMO. It's like getting a hat for your glove or something. Don't expect them to be either as common, or as helpful for the watch as they are for the iPhone. Someone rocking a case on their Apple Watch will be quite an anomaly I think. 1 2 years ago Reply dstrauss It's actually more like getting a mitten to cover over your Isotoner glove. 1 2 years ago Reply freediverx That's like covering your furniture in plastic covers. https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/03/13/05/031305e68cb48ec2... 0 2 years ago Reply vrpj My guess on AppleCare Plus for Apple Watch is $59.* And yes, you should get it. (Might be more for the Edition. Might still be $59 and amortized over the cost of all Editions. Probably includes a Genius Bar Butler and an armed guard to pick it up from your NYC penthouse for repair. ...I am not kidding. Clearly those kind of bucks will come with concierge services.) 0 2 years ago Reply Gazoobee AppleCare includes replacement cost though, so the Edition AppleCare, might be as highly priced as the Watch itself. 0 2 years ago Reply freediverx I can't imagine how someone who can afford to blow $10,000-17,000 on an electronic watch that will be obsolete in a few years would be inclined to spend extra money for an extended warranty on said item. 0 2 years ago Reply Gazoobee To me, anyone buying the Edition watch is already in "stupid land" so all bets are off. A person who buys this watch isn't thinking rationally to begin with so who knows what they will or won't buy. I'm sure there is some douchebag out there right now, thinking of buying the Edition watch and simultaneously talking to their jeweller about possibly gluing some diamonds on it. -1 2 years ago Reply Essayons Solutions You could apply the "thinking rationally" part to the entire jewelry and fashion industries. Louis V sells a lot more $6,000 handbags than most people realize. But last time I checked, this was still America. Not sure when everyone became deputized as personal conduct inspectors. 0 2 years ago Reply richard451 " and adds coverage for up to two incidents of accidental damage — though there's an additional service fee for those" - that's not for the Mac line of products. Also your image for Applecare vs AppleCare+ is incorrect for the Mac product as Applecare is three years of support, not two. You also should include warranty plans from Apple retailers such as Best Buy. For the same price as AppleCare you can replace your Apple product for any reason whatsoever. -1 2 years ago Reply freediverx "You also should include warranty plans from Apple retailers such as Best Buy." BestBuy and its GeekSquad subsidiary are horrible. Their technicians are a caustic mix of incompetence and greedy, self-serving deceitfulness. If you look at BestBuy's extended warranty page they're already lying by suggesting that a smartphone display would cost $275 to repair, when Apple actually charges just $109 to replace the screen on an iPhone. BestBuy's basic extended warranty (which excludes loss & theft coverage) costs $160 for two years (compared to $99 from Apple.) Their terms are completely ambiguous about the service fees charged for repairs under their extended warranty, with a stated range of $30-200 per incident (compared to Apple's $79 per incident.) "For the same price as AppleCare you can replace your Apple product for any reason whatsoever"" BestBuy's service contract is a labyrinth of confusing and ambiguous legalese and contains absolutely nothing to support your claim that they will "replace your Apple product for any reason whatsoever." 0 2 years ago Reply richard451 Right.

Read my breakdown of AppleCare+ above and you'l see what a poor deal it is for iPhones. I can't image it will be any more attractive for the Watch. -1 2 years ago Reply pappy53 It is not a poor deal for the iPhone. There are several other things that could happen besides a broken screen, and there is no $79 service fee for them. EVERYTHING on the phone is covered. -1 2 years ago Reply Premium1 You have to pay $79 each time something needs fixed on the iPhone that isn't manufacturer related, hence why the poster said $79 fee. 1 2 years ago Reply pappy53 The $79 fee is only for accidental damage. The entire phone is covered for defects with no fee. If anything in that phone goes bad, it is replaced with no charge. 0 2 years ago Reply freediverx Then you're paying $99 for coverage of manufacturing defects (which excludes accidental damage) which occur after the initial 1 year warranty period expires but before the third year of AppleCare+ coverage expires. So that's really only 2 years of coverage. Anything that breaks within the first year would be covered by the standard warranty. If you purchase your iPhone with a major credit card, many of these will automatically extend your warranty coverage for up to an additional year. In this case, AppleCare+ would really only provide about one extra year of coverage. What else besides the screen is likely to break on an iPhone? The home button? The headphone jack? Neither of those come remotely close to $100 to repair or replace. 0 2 years ago Reply pappy53 Home button- $70 Headphone jack- $70 Battery- $86 Camera- Who knows Only one incident, and you lose money. Any combination of two, and you've spent more than $99. Plus, there are a lot more electronics inside, with no telling what they would cost to fix. 0 2 years ago Reply freediverx Timing is everything. If a component proved defective in the first year, you'd receive no benefit because the standard warranty would apply. If the headphone jack failed between the second and third years of ownership, you would be out $99 while I would be out only $70. Only if two or more items failed, due to defect rather than accidental damage, and only between the second and third years of ownership, would you come out ahead. That's not a very likely scenario. And it wouldn't even apply if Apple announced free repairs outside of warranty, as they often do when a component is found to be truly defective (e.g., the iPhone 5's home button.) On a related note, rather than keep the iPhone for three plus years with the added cost of AppleCare+, one might sell one's iPhone on eBay after 1 or 2 years for a very substantial amount, which can then offset the purchase of a new model, complete with another year of included warranty - in addition to all the new features the new model would bring. 0 2 years ago Reply pappy53 Between the first and second years would be applicable. There is no coverage in the third year of ownership. So, between the second and third years, we would both be out $70. But, for the second year, everything in the phone is covered for mfg. defects, with no service fee, whereas an owner without the coverage is out-of-pocket for anything that goes wrong. Just suffice to say that the coverage doesn't fit you, but that doesn't give it a blanket coverage of "a money-grabbing tactic" for everyone. There are a LOT of people in this country that would have been up the creek without a phone if not for their Applecare+ coverage. 0 2 years ago Reply freediverx "Between the first and second years would be applicable. There is no coverage in the third year of ownership" My mistake, that's correct, which makes it an even worse deal than I thought. I can see how it's tempting if you have a tendency to break your phone quite often. But if not, over a few years you will pay enough into AppleCare+ to replace any damaged phones with money to spare. 0 2 years ago Reply freediverx pappy53: "there is no $79 service fee " Per Apple's website: "AppleCare+ for iPhone $99 - Coverage for up to two incidents of accidental damage, (2) each subject to a $79 service fee plus applicable tax" pappy53: "It is not a poor deal for the iPhone. There are several other things that could happen besides a broken screen" It doesn't matter what breaks, the point is that you're only covered for two incidents of accidental damage and each incident incurs a $79 fee, in addition to the $99 you paid up front for coverage. I used the display as an example because 1) it is the most likely thing to break accidentally on an iPhone, and 2) it is about the most expensive thing to replace on the iPhone. If your screen breaks twice within the coverage period it ill cost you more with AppleCare+ than without it. If it breaks a third time it isn't covered. If it never breaks you wasted $99. Can you describe a likely combination of iPhone repairs due to accidental damage that would incur lesser out of pocket costs with AppleCare+ than without? 0 2 years ago Reply pappy53 "It doesn't matter what breaks, the point is that you're only covered for two incidents of accidental damage and each incident incurs a $79 fee, in addition to the $99 you paid up front for coverage." It does matter. If something in that phone just goes bad, then it is not accidental damage, and will not have a $79 fee. 0 2 years ago Reply Essayons Solutions I have no personal experience with claims thru credit cards. But from friends, it never worked out, because they only paid the $199 and not the full phone price. I don't recall the details, but there were major hoops related to contract termination or reactivation. Maybe someone with firsthand experience can address this. 0 2 years ago Reply Gazoobee Only if you end up using it does it have value though. 0 2 years ago Reply mikezmac You have an internal battery. None hold their charge forever. Before your AppleCare wears out bring the phone in and you'll get a new phone. (Most of these battery's are rated for 1000 charges, over 2 years they wear out and hold less of a charge as time passes) 0 2 years ago Reply Gazoobee Interesting idea, but I tend to disagree. I am currently using an iPhone 5 for example, some of which have a documented battery problem, so after using it for two years already I took it in and got a whole new battery. However, the battery that I had before, despite being on that list of "bad batteries" performed fine and had no charging problems. The new "fixed" battery performs the same as the old. I've also owned lots and lots of devices over the years and never saw any real change in the battery performance over that short a time. I don't think 2 years is any kind of a hard limit to the battery use, and I don't believe most folks will see any change in their battery capacity or it's ability to charge and discharge in that short of a time frame. 0 2 years ago Reply mikezmac All lithium-ion batteries loose the ability to hold a charge over time. Within 500 cycles your battery will only charge up to 80% of it's capacity. This isn't unique to Apple it's how the battery works. This being said after a few years if you are under Apple Care you should take advantage of it and get a new battery (apple has always just replaced my phone). 0 2 years ago Reply Gerryinbc Apple Care is just another word for extended warranty or insurance. In my opinion, the cost of this insurance is always too high no matter what the product is. I always turn it down and have saved a lot of money by doing so. I also consider that if I am buying a reputable brand (which Apple obviously is) then I am also likely paying a premium already for an extra degree of reliability over a cheaper product. Salespeople always push the extended warranty with some vigour and it's obviously because they make money with it. I get a kick out of how they have just sold me on how good something is and now have to tell me how likely it is to FU and so I need the extra protection. My answer to that is "No thanks". If they persist I simply tell them that if I hear another word about extended warranty that I will change my mind about buying the product at all. If you buy something electronic and it is going to FU due to a manufacturing defect, you'll know about it long before the original warranty period is up. IMO, of course. 0 2 years ago Reply freediverx "If you buy something electronic and it is going to FU due to a manufacturing defect, you'll know about it long before the original warranty period is up." That's inaccurate in my experience. I had a $2500 PowerBook G4 that had to be trashed because the logic board went bad after the warranty expired. The repair would have cost about $1000. My early 2013 Retina MacBook Pro has a display defect relating to image retention that only became troublesome after the first year, plus there's some other hardware issue that causes display artifacts and frequent reboots. It's only now that Apple acknowledged the issue and agreed to repair it out of warranty. These would have been covered under AppleCare. Additionally, telephone tech support for three years can come in handy for any computer. That said, I still think AppleCare is grossly overpriced, and i consider it a rather distasteful money-grabbing tactic for a company so awash in profits. 1 2 years ago Reply Gazoobee I've worked in tech for a long time and worked on a lot of Macs, and this statement: "If you buy something electronic and it is going to FU due to a manufacturing defect, you'll know about it long before the original warranty period is up." ... is close to 100% true in my experience (at least for Macs). Very rarely do you get bit in the bum by anything like that logic board failure. Most "bad Macs" I've experienced were either having problems right out of the box, or the user reported problems within a week of first use. If your Mac runs solidly for the first year (the free warranty period), it's likely to stay that way if you treat it properly. I buy AppleCare for refurbished products sometimes, but I don't think I've ever bought it on any product I use myself personally. 0 2 years ago Reply msm0511 I'm on my 3rd logic board on my MBP, all of which failed after the first year. If I didn't buy the extra protection I would've been screwed. Unfortunately, my extra care ran out recently, so if something else happens it's all out of pocket. On the other hand, I've got a white plastic MB I've had for about 6 or 7 years that's never had any problems. 0 2 years ago Reply freediverx That's ridiculous. They should have just given you a new machine. Which model/year was that MBP? 0 2 years ago Reply msm0511 Late 2011. 15 inch. I got an email about the class action suit that said they had to make any repairs up until Feb. 2015. Of course that's already past as well. 0 2 years ago Reply Gazoobee I have some experience in tech retail, and most of the time when you buy an "extended warranty" it's actually an outright scam. Places like FutureShop in Canada (probably the biggest tech retailer) do this, and I'm sure there are more than enough chains in the USA that do the same. The reason it's a scam, is that you are buying the warranty from the retailer instead of the manufacturer, and it's basically worthless. If you do manage to force the retailer to honour it when you need to, it's usually a case of them just giving you a new version of whatever it is they sold you, (under pressure), and they will try to give you returned stock, or floor stock for that anyway. Mostly, they just refuse to honour the agreement and then you find out some tiny clause that let's them off the hook. In these situations, (mostly big-box stores and big-box tech stores), the "extended warranty" is basically the commission that the sales person gets, and the profit the store gets. That's why they sell you so hard on it. The products are all priced down almost to cost levels, because of competition with the other stores so the profit margin for the store, and the sales commission of the floor person is contained within the "extended warranty." Applecare is different from this in that it is from the manufacturer, is good value (if you end up using it), and the sales people aren't on commission so they aren't shoving it down your throat anyway. They also don't play games when you show up with a problem, they actually fix it, and don't give you attitude. So Applecare is not really an "extended warranty" in the same sense as other typical extended warranty's offered in the business. Personally, I believe that ALL insurance of any kind is a bit "scammy" in that it means you are paying money for something that 9 times out of 10 you will never use or need. That rubs me the wrong way so I never buy it, but if you are the type that *likes* the idea of insurance, AppleCare is actually one of the better ones out there. 2 2 years ago Reply freediverx While I wholeheartedly agree that the quality of service you receive from Apple under AppleCare far surpasses what you would receive from a retailer, I can't agree that AppleCare is a good value, especially for an iPhone. If you look at my previous comment I outlined the out of pocket costs if someone requires zero, one, or two iPhone repairs with and without AppleCare+. Unless you can point out where I missed something or goofed up on the math I think I made a pretty strong case against the value of AppleCare+ for an iPhone. 0 2 years ago Reply Gazoobee Agreed. I never use it myself. There are a lot of people who won't be happy until they have "insurance" though, and see a value in it despite the fact that it objectively *isn't* a good value as you say. 0 2 years ago Reply freediverx And just to reiterate how much I do recommend AppleCare for a Mac... Just got off the phone with Apple troubleshooting an issue I'm having with my Airport Extreme router. Result: They are sending me a replacement router at no charge, even though the router is over 4 years old... because it's covered by my AppleCare warranty on my 2013 MacBook Pro. 0 2 years ago Reply Essayons Solutions I've had two laptops and one iMac fry six to twelve months after AppleCare expired. All three times, their techs waived a magic wand and fixed it for free, just because. All three were old age problems, not anything that tipped their hand ahead during the first 36 months. And 2 out of 3 times, they replaced parts with major upgrades (eg, replacing an 80 gig drive with a 160). (Actually, 3 out of 4 times. Had a battery go bad in an 8 gig iPhone 3, gave me a 16 gig 3GS in return.) AppleCare has easily paid for itself in my household, with zero claims due to accidents or personal liability. But maybe it's just that my wife smiles a lot when she drops off the machines. 0 2 years ago Reply mikezmac I've found that with internal batteries it's a smart buy always. Also if you resell your apple stuff it helps re selling. People don't want to buy stuff out of warenty. My iPad i brought in before the AppleCare wore out and had them check my battery, they gave me a new iPad. Battery's don't hold their charges forever. It also covers accidental. With a watch I wear on my wrist I'm getting it for sure. I'm not very graceful and I'm sure I'll smack into something sooner or later. 0 2 years ago Reply T-Will I prefer to put the $180 bucks (premium+deductible) into a savings account to put towards any out of pocket repairs I might need for an incident. Rather than giving Apple $100 that I may or may not use. But if you're not disciplined enough to save the money up front, or you're planning to have more than one repair incident, then AppleCare might be the way to go. ;-) 1 2 years ago Reply freediverx AppleCare+ for an iPhone 6 costs $99 and each incident of accidental damage comes with a service fee of $79. So that's $99 down the toilet if you never need to use the warranty and almost $180 if you do. If you cracked your screen twice, then your total cost of repairs+warranty would be about $258. Alternately, for those who do not get AppleCare+, if you drop your iPhone 6 and crack the display (the most common type of damage) you can get it replaced at the Apple store for just $109. Two such incidents would cost you $218. If your phone is never damaged you will pay $0. So as you can see, purchasing an AppleCare+ policy for an iPhone is a waste of money and a terrible value. (Also, Apple used to give you a new phone, whereas current policy dictates that they will just replace the screen on your existing phone, meaning any wear, tear, and scratches on the frame are there to stay even after paying through the nose for AppleCare+ and repairs.) 1 2 years ago Reply Gazoobee For the record, even when Apple gives you a "new phone," it actually isn't. It's refurbished. I've had this done twice with iPhones because I'm an early buyer and a lot of the first production run is typically flawed in one way or the other. I've had some heated arguments with store staff about this. They insist you are getting a "new phone" but it's actually something called "genius stock" which is composed of refurbished phones that other people have previously returned, that have been fixed up to "like new." When I found out that my $900 brand new phone was being replaced with a refurbished one instead of new, I argued about it all the way up the support chain until they just got tired of me and stopped answering my emails. They will tell you over and over again that it's "not refurbished" but then if you ask them to describe what the stock actually is, they tell you that the phone does not necessarily contain all new parts, that it may be actually made of the parts of several individual iPhones blended together, that it's at least partially assembled by the genius staff at the retail level, and that it's "carefully tested" to make sure that it comes up to the same level as "new stock." In other words, refurbished. 0 2 years ago Reply freediverx "For the record, even when Apple gives you a "new phone," it actually isn't. It's refurbished." This is absolutely correct, but in my experience anything refurbished by Apple looks and feels as good as new. The case and glass are flawless without the faintest signs of previous use. This has not been my experience with other manufacturers. 1 2 years ago Reply T-Will We've had a couple iPhone replacements from Apple, and one time my wife's replacement came with a broken gyroscope/accelerometer. The exchange was fairly painless, except they didn't have the 64GB replacement in stock, so she had to wait a few days to get yet another replacement. 0 2 years ago Reply Gazoobee One replacement they gave me (in store) even had someone else's email stuck in it. It was the email they used for their Apple ID too. I was pressed for time so they just gave me the "raw" iPhone and I was going to sync up my stuff later, but as I left the store I got an email for the guy who's phone it was previously. I'm not even sure how this can happen given that they supposedly reset the entire phone, and re-flash the software, but it did. I deleted the account, but another person might not have been as honourable. Pissed me off though as I had again, just handed them my brand new $900 iPhone which was all of a week old, but had a factory build defect. Then they hand me this PoS used one with someone else's stuff in it. Incredible. 0 2 years ago Reply Quietly Observant Try being handed one of their "new phones" that's scratched all to hell and they look at you incredulously stating its a new phone.

To play the devil's advocate, I think maybe it's the sheer volume of iPhone sales that's got to them. there are often so many units of so many different degrees of acceptability flying between their retail stores, the customers and the factory that they just don't actually know what's going on anymore.

Apple makes great gear but their computers have a history of developing expensive defects relating to the display, graphics subsystem, and/or logic board, only after the standard warranty expires. Any of the above could cost as much as a new computer to replace. And even when Apple admits a defect is their fault, it can take years of complaints and class action lawsuits before they acknowledge the problem and agree to repair or replace out of warranty. For everything else, I consider Apple's extended warranties to be a crappy deal, which is how I feel about most other companies' extended warranty offers. These warranties are priced in a way where, at best, you will be pre-paying for the eventual cost of a likely repair. At worst, you will be throwing away money, and the amount of money you throw away will grow year after year as you purchase AppleCare for every new Apple product you buy. It's a racket. For anyone with a Wells Fargo credit card, if you pay your cell phone bill with their card they automatically cover your smartphone against accidents or theft - at no cost - for up to $600 per claim and up to two claims per 12 month period, with only a $25 deductible per incident. https://www.wellsfargo.com/credit-cards/features/cell-phone-protection/ Now that - unlike AppleCare+ - is a good deal. 0 2 years ago Reply Premium1 Seems like a waste for someone like yourself who upgrades the phone every year. 0 2 years ago Reply cardfan As Apple's first water resistant product (is this right) it'll be interesting to see how they treat water damage.

Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. How does Apple Watch NikeLab compare to the standard Apple Watch Nike+? Take a look! Apple Watch NikeLab is a special edition variant of the regular Apple Watch Nike+, itself a variant of the aluminum Apple Watch Series 2. What makes it distinct, beyond the Nike+ integrations and watch faces, is the currently-exclusive band — in bone and black. Yes, Apple Watch NikeLab is "just" an Apple Watch Nike+ in space gray with a so-far uniquely band color It's a great looking band color, though. "Bone" is a morbid name but accurately describes the way it looks, and the black accents really set it off. The black accents are much more visible on the back than on the front, though it doesn't really matter when you're wearing it. Otherwise it's just like the regular Apple Watch Nike+ that's been available since September The case is exactly the same space gray aluminum with ion-x (ion exchange) glass over the display. It's the bone and black band that's distinct from the black and volt (or anthracite and black) bands available on the standard models. I don't have the silver aluminum Apple Watch Nike+, but I do have the platinum and white band and, while the difference in shades is subtle, you can easily see it when side-by-side. (Especially around the holes.) Perplexingly, the pin isn't matched to the casing, like other Apple Watch combos. The regular space gray Apple Watch Nike+ has a space gray pin. Similarly, the rose gold and gold Apple Watches have matching rose gold and gold pins. Apple Watch NikeLab, though, doesn't. Instead, it has a stainless steel pin like the Nike sport bands sold separately. I wonder if this color was originally supposed to be sold separately as well? And yes, it looks awesome paired with the Apple Watch Edition While it doesn't match as exactly as the platinum and white Nike sport band, the bone and black NikeLab band still looks terrific when paired with the ceramic white Apple Watch Edition. Of course, you currently have to buy both the Edition and the NikeLab to get the set. Fingers crossed bone and black gets sold separately eventually. Any questions on Apple Watch NikeLab?

This should come as a relief to owners of the first-generation Apple Watch, as the company has just added an extra year to the smartwatch’s warranty to cover growing reports of damage caused by the battery. Users don’t need to worry about their Apple Watch bursting into flames or exploding, but a number of users have experienced cases of “swelling batteries,” or when the battery expands inside the wearable so much that it forces the face of the watch to pop off. Examples can be seen on Reddit, Twitter, and even Apple’s own support forums. So, the first-gen Apple Watch is now covered by a two-year extended warranty for battery issued, making for three years total when including the one-year limited warranty. This comes from a recent notice from Apple sent to authorized repair centers, which was obtained by 9to5Mac, and coincides with two years passing since the release of the original Apple Watch on April 24th, 2015.

After 6 months the screen randomly popped off while wearing the watch- @Apple HK blamed a "swollen battery" pic.twitter.com/7qxtHw7Zje — Stephanie Linker (@steph_linker) April 16, 2017 It’s important to note that this expanding battery issue does not seem to be widespread at all, so there’s no need to be alarmed about it happening to you. But if you experience the problem, even if your Apple Watch is over two years, rest assured that you’re covered by the warranty.

The lower revenue and profit outlook — which Qualcomm hinted at recently when it reported earnings for the quarter that ended in March — highlights the rising stakes in the rocky relationship between the two tech giants that shows no sign of improving. Qualcomm now expects revenue of $4.8 billion to $5.6 billion for its fiscal third quarter ending June 30. Earnings are pegged at 52 cents to 62 cents per share under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. For the same quarter last year, Qualcomm posted $6 billion in revenue and GAAP earnings of 97 cents per share. In January, Apple sued Qualcomm, saying it forces smartphone makers to pay too much for use of its 3G-4G standard essential patents, which are required to be licensed under “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” terms. Qualcomm counters that its royalty rates — which top out at roughly 5 percent of the device price — have been negotiated through hundreds of agreements spanning two decades. According to Qualcomm, its licensing business model allowed Apple to enter the smartphone market with little or no investment in core cellular technology. While 3G-4G patent licenses make up only about one-third of Qualcomm’s annual revenue, they account for two-thirds of its annual profit. Apple is the world’s largest seller of smartphones. In a recent research report, Bernstein Research Analyst Stacy Rasgon estimated that Apple could account for as much as one-third of Qualcomm’s royalty business, or more than $2 billion a year. Apple doesn’t directly license patents from Qualcomm. Instead, Foxconn and other contract manufacturers that build iPhones and iPads have license agreements. Apple reimburses them for royalties. Last quarter, Apple withheld some Qualcomm royalty reimbursements to contract manufacturers, but only up to $1 billion. That’s equal to royalty “rebates” that Apple contends it’s owed by Qualcomm under a separate business cooperation deal. When it reported March quarter earnings, Qualcomm wasn’t sure Apple would block reimbursements beyond the $1 billion amount. But now Qualcomm says Apple indicated that it will continue withholding reimbursements until the legal war between the two companies is resolved. As a result, Qualcomm’s new financial guidance assumes no royalty payments from iPhone and iPad contract manufacturers in the quarter. “Apple is improperly interfering with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm’s licensees,” said General Counsel Don Rosenberg in a statement. “Apple’s continued interference with Qualcomm’s agreements to which Apple is not a party is wrongful and the latest step in Apple’s global attack on Qualcomm.” Indeed, Qualcomm’s patent licensing business has come under fire worldwide. Last fall, the Korea Fair Trade Commission fined Qualcomm more than $850 million for allegedly abusing its market power in the way it licenses patents. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission also filed a lawsuit, and Apple launched its legal action shortly afterward. Qualcomm denies the allegations. It has countersued Apple, appealed the South Korea fine and is seeking dismissal of the FTC case on the grounds that it fails to show how Qualcomm licensing practices harmed the smartphone market. In trading Friday, Qualcomm shares rose 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $53.74.

The tech titan has extended its wearable's repair coverage related to battery woes to last two years instead of one, according to a note Apple sent to authorized repair centers that 9to5mac got its hands on. If you include its first year with limited warranty, the device's owners can enjoy three years of coverage, and it's all thanks to a several reports complaining of batteries ballooning inside their timepieces. Some posts on Reddit and on Apple's discussion board talk about how their first-gen Watches' batteries ballooned and displaced the screens like what happened in the image above. It doesn't seem to be a huge issue, and we haven't seen anyone claim that their device exploded or caught fire like Samsung's Galaxy Notes did.

X Apple to report lower than expected second quarter results This week’s major business events: BP results; Irish unemployment rate about 14 hours ago Updated: about 13 hours ago Mark Hilliard Apple is expected to show off its next iPhone with its new OLED display at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Photograph: Yuya Shino/Reuters         Monday Results: BP, Olympus. Indicators: US manufacturing PMI, prices, employment (Apr). Tuesday Results: Apple, Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Geberit (Q1), BNP Paribas, Hilton Worldwide, Hugo Boss, Mastercard, Mondelez International, Pfizer.

Meetings: International Chambers of Commerce (ICC) Ireland hosts morning with Alexis Mourre, president of ICC Court of Arbitration (Dublin Dispute Resolution Centre, Dublin 7); Bovis Homes AGM (details to be confirmed). Concern prior to Apple results Apple is due to report second-quarter results on Tuesday and there are concerns things may not be quite as good as expected at the company that seems to be unable to do wrong. Both JP Morgan and UBS have told investors results could fall short although buy ratings have remained in place given the optimism surrounding the next iPhone. In a statement reported by CNBC, JP Morgan said it remained bullish on the prospects of the new phone “given what we believe is unprecedented pent-up replacement demand” combined with expectations for a materially different product later this year. “Having said that, we believe FQ3 guidance could be somewhat weak assuming Apple also believes consumers will want to wait for new product availability this fall,” it said in a note to clients. It believes there is a “better-than-normal chance” Apple will show off the next iPhone with its new OLED display at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June. In January the company said it had recorded new highs in sales of iPhones, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple Services during its all-important fiscal first quarter. However, sales of iPads were down 19 per cent year-on-year and, despite the reported rise in watch sales, the “other product” category that includes the device saw sales slip 8 per cent on last year. Wednesday Results: LafargeHolcim, Alibaba Group, Anheuser Busch Inbev, Avis Budget Group, Carlsberg, Carlyle Group, Estée Lauder, Facebook, Fitbit, Garmin, Groupon, HSBC Holdings, Kraft Heinz, Royal Dutch Shell, Statoil.

Indicators: Irish services PMI (Apr), industrial production (Mar); Euro zone composite and services PMI (Apr), retail sales (Mar); UK mortgage lending (Mar), consumer credit (Mar), net lending (Mar), services PMI (Apr); German composite and services PMI (Apr); US exports and imports (Mar). Meetings: Project Management Institute conference (Aviva Stadium, Dublin); RTÉ Mojocon international media conference on mobile content creation and new technology (Radisson Blu, Galway). Brexit on the agenda It is likely to become the most common theme of business conferences in the next two years and on Thursday the Project Management Institute conference will tackle the thorny, if still entirely unpredictable, issue of Brexit and its effect on the economy. Up to 400 members of the Irish chapter are expected at the Aviva stadium where speakers will include Cathriona Hallahan, managing director of Microsoft Ireland and Féilim Harvey, partner at PwC, heading up portfolio and programme management practice in Ireland. The PMI is forecasting a 12 per cent year-on-year growth in the number of project managers, or about 20,000 in Ireland by the end of 2020, right in the middle of the Brexit storm. “It’s clear that without effective leadership, the uncharted territory that is Brexit has the potential to cause serious damage for unprepared businesses,” said Niall Murphy, Ireland chapter president, ahead of the meeting. The PMI here has almost 1,200 members while there are currently over 50,000 people employed in sectors including IT, construction, pharmaceuticals and manufacturing. Féilim Harvey said Brexit was creating particular uncertainty around exchange rates, supply chain, access to markets and, for certain financial services organisations, continuing access to the single market. “We are heading into extremely turbulent times,” he said. More on Thursday. Friday Results: Smurfit Kappa Group, Kennedy Wilson Europe, IAG, Amadeus IT Group, Moody’s.

The battery in their units has swollen, thus leaving the device of no use. Apple has come to their aid by informing authorized repair facilities that the Apple Watch swollen battery issue is now covered under warranty. It has extended the Apple Watch service coverage to include the first-generation smartwatches suffering from this issue. Apple has decided to extend the repair coverage for the very first Apple Watch units that have been impacted by this swollen battery issue. The coverage extension provides owners of these units with two years of additional service coverage over and above the one-year free warranty that all customers get for free. It’s not uncommon for lithium-ion batteries to swell and expand when they are overcharged, punctured or generally damaged. The Apple Watch uses lithium-ion batteries like most consumer devices and even though such devices are cleared for use after extensive testing, it’s not uncommon for these issues to come up. It’s unclear right now just how many first-generation Apple Watch owners are facing this issue with their smartwatches. There have been some reports about this on Apple’s official support forums and on Reddit. Users can tell that their battery has expanded when they see a slight displacement in the display or even cracking. Filed in Apple >Gadgets. Read more about Apple Watch and smartwatches.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root gizmodo How to Abandon Android and Switch to iOS David NieldYesterday 1:02pm Filed to: Android iOS mobile 101 5 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Image: Gizmodo Maybe you like the curves of the iPhone 7, maybe you just don’t trust Google with your data any more, or maybe someone just gave you an iPhone as a birthday present. Whatever the reason, here’s how to get your entire digital life from Android to iOS with as little head-scratching as possible. Advertisement For simplicity’s sake, we’ll assume you’re set up on Android with your data plugged into Google’s services (Gmail, Google Calendar and so on). If you’re using something else, like a Microsoft or Yahoo email address, the process will be similar, and often just involves installing the relevant Android-analogous app on your new iPhone. We should also point out that a future Field Guide will talk about moving in the opposite direction, so watch this space for that. Apple’s Move to iOS app Move to iOS has its merits... if you can get it to work. (Image: Screenshot) You can automate much of what we’re about to talk about with Apple’s official Move to iOS app for Android: it handles email, calendars, contacts, photos, videos (taken with the device), and even text message history. Advertisement There are a couple of caveats to consider. One, you need to be setting up your iPhone from scratch, so it needs to be brand new or freshly reset, and two, it doesn’t give you all that much control over the way everything gets switched. It also misses out some of the files and data we’re going to cover below, and as you’ll note in reviews of the app, it can be hit and miss on actually transferring texts. Moving texts SMS Backup+ can send your texts to Gmail. (Image: Screenshot) Moving SMSes is tricky—Move to iOS is in theory one of the cleanest options, as we’ve mentioned, but you need to be setting your iPhone up from scratch, and users report mixed results in transferring SMS history right into iOS Messages. We tried several times to get the app to work on our devices and had to give up as it refused to make a wireless connection, but your mileage may vary. Backing up an archive of your Android texts isn’t too difficult: SMS Backup+ will send them all to Gmail for you, and SMS Backup & Restore can back them up to Google Drive or Dropbox too. A variety of third-party Windows and macOS apps promise to do the job for you as well, but we’d be wary of installing anything unofficial unless it’s been around for a long time, is regular updated, and has a long list of positive user reviews. We can’t vouch for the security or reliability of any of them, except for SMS Backup+, which we’ve been using without any problems for years, and SMS Backup & Restore, which comes from a very reputable software developer. Advertisement Sponsored Unless you can get Move to iOS to work better than we did, replicating an exact copy of your Android SMS history in Messages looks almost impossible—at best you can get some kind of archive exported for future reference. It’s a different story with other instant messaging apps, which we’ll come on to later. Moving emails If you want to keep your Google accounts active, they integrate neatly with iOS. (Image: Screenshot) If you want to take your Gmail account with you over to iOS, you’ve got two options: install the Gmail app for Apple devices, or add your Gmail account to the default Mail app on iOS. The first one is easier but the second helps you cut ties with Google more quickly. First, you need to prepare your Gmail account for the great export. Open the Settings tab on the web (click the cog icon then Settings), switch to the Forwarding and POP/IMAP section, and enable either POP for all emails or IMAP. Are you going to carry on using your Gmail account? Then use IMAP, which gives you two-way access to your Gmail inbox from Apple’s Mail app. Do you just want to download your old Google messages and never look back? Go for POP, which will download all your emails. With that done, open up Settings in iOS, choose Mail, then tap Accounts and Add Account. Choose Google if you’re taking the IMAP approach, then follow the instructions on screen to sign into your Gmail; choose Other if you’re using POP, in which case you’ll need these details to configure access. Moving contacts and calendars  iCloud can accept contacts but not calendars. (Image: Screenshot) You can move your Google (Android) contacts and calendars over to iOS very easily: open Settings on your iPhone, tap Contacts (or Calendar), then choose Accounts. Choose Add Account and Google, or pick the existing Google entry from the list, then log in with your Google credentials to get everything synced over. Advertisement Advertisement That then keeps your Google Contacts and Google Calendars in sync with the native Contacts and Calendar apps on iOS (and macOS)—but perhaps that’s not what you want. If you’d rather forget the syncing aspect and just move your Google data over in a one-time operation, it’s a bit more involved and needs a manual export and import: it’s messier, but it does mean you can get everything natively inside Apple’s apps and leave Google behind. First you export your Google contacts to a .vcf file from the Contacts app on Android (in Settings on the app menu) or via Google Contacts on the web. Select all your contacts then pick More to find the Export link. That .vcf file can then be imported through iCloud on the web or emailed to your iPhone—once you tap on the attachment, you’ll be asked if you want to import the contacts. It’s a similar process with Google Calendar. Here you need to visit the web interface, then export your schedules by clicking the cog icon, Settings, Calendars and Export Calendars. The files you’ve created can’t be imported into iCloud though—you need to add them in the Calendar app in macOS to sync them to an iPhone via iCloud. If you don’t have a macOS machine on hand, you’re pretty much stuck with entering your birthdays and appointments all over again, unless you’re happy with just using Google Calendar for iOS or trying Move to iOS for Android with the caveats we mentioned earlier. Moving photos and videos Google Photos is the most obvious option for photos and videos. (Image: Screenshot) This can be incredibly straightforward or rather messy depending on how you want to do it and where your photos and videos are stored. Assuming you’re taking advantage of Google Photos, the native photo manager for (stock) Android, you can simply install the iOS version to get at your whole library pictures and movies (and to upload anything you take on your new iPhone). Advertisement You go to Settings then Back up & sync and Back up device folders to make sure you’ve got absolutely everything copied off your phone and up to the cloud. Even if you’re abandoning Google services completely, this option will show you all the different folders on your Android device where pictures are stored. If you want to get everything moved, pixel-by-pixel, from Google Photos to Apple’s iCloud Photo Library, more effort is required: we’ve actually done a complete guide to this in the past. Refer to that article for full details, but in summary you need to use Google Drive or Google Takeout to get hard copies of your photos and videos downloaded to a macOS or Windows machine. From there you can import them into Photos for macOS, iTunes on Windows, or iCloud on the web, and from there over to an iPhone. Advertisement If you don’t use Google Photos, you need some other method for getting all your Android photos and videos to a computer, and from there to Apple Photos and iCloud. Dropbox will do it, for example, or you can use the tried and trusted USB cable method. Just be sure that you’ve harvested all the files from all your apps—apps like Twitter and WhatsApp save photos in a different location to the main gallery, for example. Moving music and movies Importing files to iTunes is one way to get them on iOS. Image: Screenshot Android being Android, you might have your music and movies on your phone in all kinds of ways: Netflix, Plex, Google Play Movies & TV, and so on. Just about any video or music app you have installed on Android will be on iOS as well, including those we just mentioned—a lot of the time there are no files to transfer, just logins to manage. Advertisement Any local files you’ve got queued up on Android should work just fine on iOS too. You don’t have to use Apple’s own music and video apps if you don’t want, but if you do then you need to get your local files off your Android device and into iTunes with the help of a macOS or Windows machine. Presumably a lot of the files on your Android device were synced from a computer in the first place, but if not they can be transferred via USB or an app like Dropbox, as with your personal photos and videos. Then from iTunes, choose File and Add to Library (macOS) or Add File to Library (Windows) to import the media. If you run into file format problems we’d recommend using Handbrake to solve them. If you’re heavily invested in purchases from Google Play Movies & TV, there is an iOS version. Image: Screenshot iOS is more restrictive when it comes to syncing music and movies to your phone, and if you don’t want to go through iTunes, you need to use an app that can pull files straight from the cloud or over a Wi-Fi network rather than relying on local storage: the likes of Plex, Spotify and VLC will all do the job. Advertisement If you aren’t cutting the Google cord completely, Google Drive is another good option for watching video on iOS without having to actually transfer any files, because you can stream files straight from the cloud. It’s when you’re switching between mobile OSes that these device-agnostic apps and platforms really come into their own. In short, you’ve got plenty of choices for apps that will play your local, unrestricted, DRM-free music and movie files on iOS, while any digital library app you’ve been using on Android will have an equivalent on iOS, so there’s no real problem there either. Moving apps and games You can’t easily transfer WhatsApp chats, though you can email them to yourself. (Image: Screenshot) There’s no way around the fact that you need to get all your Android apps installed again on iOS, and pay twice in some cases. Though subscription services like Netflix and Spotify just switch straight over (moving between devices is another good reason to live your digital life in the cloud). Advertisement Advertisement Most social media and messaging apps will take everything from Android to iOS for you, though there are exceptions, with WhatsApp being one of the big ones. Unfortunately, WhatsApp’s own backup and restore function only works when you’re going from Android-to-Android or iPhone-to-iPhone. As with text messages, various third-party options are available, but we can’t vouch for any in particular. If you’re happy just having a record of your WhatsApp chats and are ready to start afresh on iPhone, you can email them to yourself. From the WhatsApp Settings screen, tap Chats, then Chat history, and Email chat: you can then pick your conversations one by one and email yourself a copy, with or without attached media. Boom Beach is one game where you can link devices. (Image: Screenshot) We can’t go through every messaging app in detail here but obviously your switch is going to be easier with those apps that store everything in the cloud (hello Google Hangouts). Virtually every instant messenger on Android has an iOS equivalent so it’s a question of exploring the import and export options—you may just have to start again with a blank message history on iOS. Advertisement Another area where you might have trouble is with your saved games and high scores: not only will you need to pay for all your games again, you’re probably going to lose your progress too. Some apps, like Subway Surfers (with Facebook) and Boom Beach (with a code), will let you transfer progress and scores between devices, but again you’ll have to do the research every game you own to be sure. If you can’t find the answers you’re looking for out on the web then contact the developer directly and see if there’s any way for getting your saved games from one platform to the other. The same goes for other types of app if you can’t see an obvious way of moving data between Android and iOS installs. Moving yet more files and data Use a file explorer to look for data you’ve missed. Image: Screenshot We’re not quite done yet! You might want to be as comprehensive as possible in your data switchover—think about any documents or spreadsheets you’ve got stored on your Android device. Most productivity apps will store these in the cloud, so getting at them from iOS should be simple, but it’s wise to double-check. Advertisement Advertisement The vast majority of Android apps can be found on iOS, with the only exceptions being advanced customization tools such as Tasker or the Android launchers, which you’re just going to have to live without in iPhone-land. Other apps should have iPhone equivalents and some kind of mechanism for switching files over—if you’re worried about something getting left behind, use a file manager like Solid Explorer for a deeper look. One of the folders to check is the Downloads folder, which brings us to our final section. Web Browsing If you’ve got Chrome on Android syncing everything like passwords and bookmarks back to the cloud, you can simply install Chrome on iOS and get on with your life, but if you’re determined to use Safari on your new iPhone then you need to jump through a few more hoops. Chrome for iOS will take all your passwords and browsing history with you. Image: Screenshot The aforementioned Move to iOS is one option for your web bookmarks, or you can set up synced versions of Chrome and Safari on macOS and use the respective export and import tools to get everything moved over (and from there to your iPhone). Advertisement If neither of those options appeal, you’re going to have to start from scratch, and the same goes for stored passwords and browsing history (you can at least access your saved Chrome passwords from this page on the web to ease the process of switching over). These elements are just too deeply integrated into Chrome to get them easily over to Safari, so embrace the chance to start afresh. It may not be possible, but ideally you want to keep your Android and iOS devices running alongside each other for a while: it makes it easier to check up on gaps in your transferred data, like browsing history, and helps you spot anything you might have missed (such as a PDF file that’s fallen through the cracks).

Valentina Palladino - Apr 30, 2017 4:00 pm UTC Enlarge Andrew Cunningham reader comments 23 Share this story Apple added one extra year to its warranty for some first-generation Apple Watches, according to a note sent to authorized service providers obtained by 9to5Mac. The company will now cover eligible Apple Watches for three years after the original purchase date. The first-gen devices covered by this warranty are those experiencing ballooning battery issues. Further ReadingReview: The still optional but pleasantly refined Apple Watch Series 2 "Apple has extended Service coverage to eligible Apple Watch (1st gen) models with an expanded/swollen battery to three years after the original date of purchase," the note states. "Eligible devices will be covered for two years beyond the original 1-year Limited Warranty." Customers on Apple forums and Reddit have described these battery problems as far back as November 2016. Some customers reported watch displays being partially displaced from the case thanks to an expanding battery inside the device. This doesn't appear to be a widespread problem and none of the reports detail any Apple Watches catching fire or exploding like Samsung's Note devices, or even similarly to the recent Fitbit Flex 2 situation. But Apple clearly wants to get in front of this issue and provide affected customers with a safe and convenient solution. This warranty update comes just after the first-generation Apple Watch turned two years old earlier this month.

Technological changes, marketing automation, a global shift towards the smartphones, and apps dominating the smartphone industry are changing the app industry in 2017 and beyond. The following 10 app marketing trends are expected to dominate the industry in 2017 and will help you stay ahead of the competition. 1.  Focus on Retention One of the biggest app marketing trends is none other than a significant increase in post-app advertising and remarketing to increase user engagement and retention. Statistics show that as much as 95 percent of app users will be gone 90 days after downloading. In 2016, the average investment on app retention was quite low. However, brands are now focusing more on post-app marketing to make sure that people use the app after installing it. Post-app ads, remarketing, reward programs, cross-sell, upsell, and email marketing are some of the techniques that app marketers will focus on for retention. This is where you should spend your app marketing budget this year. 2.  Media Consolidation According to Apsalar, top 20 best media partners will capture over 80 percent of marketing spend in 2017. App marketers are focusing more on the quality of app installs than on the quantity. Marketers and brands, therefore, are more interested in spending ad budget on partnering and featuring their apps on proven media partners irrespective of cost. Get in touch with a top media in your industry today and partner with it. 3.  Apple Search Ads Yes, search ads by Apple are the new thing in app marketing that is sure to dominate in 2017 and beyond. Brands that are using Apple Search Ads are getting outstanding results. The average cost per tap stands at 50 cents while brands are paying $1 per app install. This is not just cheap but the conversion rate, according to Adweek, is around 50 percent. You shouldn’t miss Apple search ads. Apple search ads will get all the love from marketers and large and small apps in 2017. 4.  Focus on Conversion Optimization App marketers are focusing on conversion optimization. Stats show that 78 percent of app marketers are more concerned about the quality of the installs. This is referred as deeper conversion where marketers try to improve the quality of the install as well as the quantity of the installs. This approach will be adopted by more brands and app marketers in 2017. 5.  Influencer marketing Influencer marketing is the most cost-effective customer acquisition method. This stands true for apps too. Marketing your app to the people who influence your target audience seems to be the best approach that app marketers will use more than ever in 2017. The biggest challenge in influencer marketing is finding the right influencers. The cost associated with influencer marketing is nothing compared to the app awareness and quality of installs that you receive in return. 6.  App Store Optimization (ASO) ASO is the process of improving the visibility of your app in the app store. Just as you do SEO for websites, you should do ASO for apps. ASO will take the app industry in 2017. Statistics show that 63 percent of iOS and 58 percent of android users find new apps by browsing apps in the store. Whether you’re promoting your app on Google or Apple store, you cannot do it without ASO anymore. As of now, the two most crucial ranking factors are app title and keywords. App Search Optimization is clearly one of the major trends where you should work for if you’ve to dominate your industry. 7.  Memory It seems surprising, right? It shouldn’t be. According to a survey conducted by Google in October 2016, high memory consumption is the number one reason for app abandonment. Some 46 percent of smartphone users reported that they will stop using an app if it consumes a lot of memory. Google calls it ‘dealbreaker’. You should consider it the same way if you plan to dominate your industry. Before you do anything else, make sure your app isn’t consuming too much memory. Who knows, Google might include it in their app store search algorithm one day? 8.  Personalized Onboarding Personalized onboarding is expected to be used by a lot of apps in 2017, as predicted by Get Social. Some of the big apps like Clash of Clans, Beats, Evernote, and others have onboarding flows that keep the users hooked but most of the apps don’t have onboarding flows. The idea is to personalize onboarding so that users get to know the real value of the app. Personalizing the onboarding experience should be your top priority in 2017. 9.  Platform-Agnostic Experience Google and Apple are serious about reducing, rather removing, all the experience differences between apps and websites. Android Instant Apps and Apple introducing Siri for the desktop are indications where the two giants are heading – towards a platform-agnostic experience that provides a continuous seamless experience to their users. This is what Google and Apple will work on in 2017 and this is where you should invest your app marketing budget in the current year. Make the user experience your top priority by providing them with a smooth cross-platform experience. 10.  App Localization With the introduction and use of ASO, app localization will dominate the app marketing in 2017. As of now, there aren’t many apps that are using app localization to rank better in-store search. Some 13 percent of apps are using localization. Clash of Clans is one, among a few others. There are several ways you can use app localization for marketing. Use app store localization to target different geographical regions. Build separate personalized local app pages for different regions. It boosts visibility and increases downloads. Localize push notifications to improve app retention and engagement. Localize support pages and make them available in different languages so that users can better understand and interact. Localize app content. This includes everything ranging from time, date, language, units, etc. Conclusion App marketing might be challenging but if you know what’s coming, where the trends are leading, and how to use the trends for your benefit, you’re in the game. Stick to these ten app marketing trends if you’re serious about dominating your industry in 2017 and several years to come.

This smartwatch aims to solidify the dominant position of the consumer electronics giant in the niche, while also addressing some of the bugbears associated with the first release. But is the Apple Watch Series 2 a success, and is it ultimately worth purchasing? Image shot for ValueWalk by Sheeraz Raza Design Even the harshest critic of Apple would have to concede that the corporation has always excelled in design, and thus the original Apple Watch is already instantly recognizable. It is perhaps not surprising then that Apple has not strayed significantly from this design with the Apple Watch Series 2, certainly resisting the temptation to include a circular face. The Digital Crown has this been retained, and it still provides a convenient way of zooming in and out of apps, as well as delivering general navigation functionality. Meanwhile, new features have been added to the button located beneath the crown, transforming it into an engaging way to scroll through the new apps dock. The Series 2 is available in a range of colours: Gold, Rose Gold, Space Grey and Silver, with the gold-plated option having been phased out. But the ceramic appearance of the smartwatch is rather attractive, and it is also notable that the new Apple Watch is significantly more durable than the previous generation. Numerous options are available to consumers, but the smartwatch depicted in this review is the 38mm Gold case with midnight blue band. Strap options are plentiful, and the sport strap is particularly useful for those who intend to swim with the Apple Watch Series 2. Apple also provides an extra strap in the box with this device, which is a welcome addition. One slightly surprising aspect of this second-generation smartwatch is that it is marginally thicker than the previous release. However, this is so fractional that it is only really perceptible when placing the two watches next to one another. Image shot for ValueWalk by Sheeraz Raza Performance Performance is always key to any item of consumer electronics, and with this aim in mind Apple has updated the processes in the Apple Watch Series 2. The dual-core S2 CPU is around 50 percent faster than the processor included in the original Apple Watch, while the GPU responsible for handling the visual display is twice as fast as its predecessor. This means that the everyday operation of common functions is simply more rapid. Testing of a wide variety of applications reveals that the Apple Watch Series 2 loads everything more speedily than the previous generation. It also boots up more quickly, and overall just delivers a slick user experience; probably the best among smartwatches available on the market. Image shot for ValueWalk by Sheeraz Raza Screen Apple has included a new brighter screen with the Apple Watch Series 2, and this makes reading information easier in any lighting conditions. Indeed, the sharpness of the display makes this new smartwatch excellent for pretty much any task that you attempt with it. This is the major alteration with the Apple Watch Series 2, as the screen dimensions are identical to the first release in the series. The 1.65-inch screen is thus retained, with the 390 x 312 OLED display maintaining the attractive visage from the first release. However, with the Watch Series 2 now capable of 1000 nits, the improvement in clarity is certainly tangible. And Apple’s utilization of OLED means that black backgrounds are turned off when not in use, ensuring that the brightness of the display is preserved, as well as the battery life of the device. This detailed display is an outstanding aspect of the Apple Watch Series 2, and indeed the technology used seems to have influenced Apple in eventually including OLED in forthcoming iPhone releases. Image shot for ValueWalk by Sheeraz Raza Waterproofing Apple has paid particular attention to the waterproofing and health-tracking capabilities of the second generation Apple Watch, with the Californian corporation desiring for the smartwatch to be viewed as a fitness device. This was one area where the original Apple Watch could be legitimately criticized, as it was only water-resistant to a depth of one meter for 30 minutes. This new release improves massively on this functionality by delivering water-resistance at 50 meters under ISO standard 22810:2010. Whereas the original Apple Watch could only really be worn in the shower, the Apple Watch Series 2 is a viable swimming companion. The new ‘wet mode’ also unlocks the display of the Apple Watch Series 2 and disables touch functionality when activated. This prevents functions from being inadvertently activated while swimming, for example. In order to acknowledge this, Apple has included two new swimming options in the Workout app. Vastly improving the waterproof capabilities of the Apple Watch Series 2 ensures that this smartwatch instantly becomes more flexible and a superior fitness device. Screenshot of app for Apple Watch Series 2 in iPhone 7 Plus GPS fitness tracking Meanwhile, Apple has also included new GPS fitness-tracking functionality in the second-generation Apple Watch, transforming the abilities of this smartwatch. It was massively disappointing when Apple was unable to include GPS in the original Apple Watch, and it is a blessed relief that this features prominently second time round. The accuracy of tracking in the Series 2 is also somewhat improved over the original Apple Watch. Attempting to trick the tracking system by cycling at different speeds, for example, yields impressive results, as the next generation smartwatch delivers a superior performance in this department to its predecessor. Haptics and heart rate monitoring are also included in the new Breathe feature, ensuring that vital signs and athletic performance can be tracked at all times. Apple had originally featured fitness prominently in the advertising for the Apple Watch, but the Apple Watch Series 2 really delivers on this promise. The combination of an extremely accurate GPS system with vastly improved waterproofing means that this is now a viable fitness tracker, which can compete with the likes of Fitbit. Image shot for ValueWalk by Sheeraz Raza WatchOS3 Apple has also dropped a new operating system for the second generation of its smartwatch, with watchOS3 debuting. The consumer electronics behemoth has already promised to make continual and regular improvements to the operating system, and has done so since the first Apple Watch launched, but the latest iteration takes advantage of this entirely new system. watchOS3 encompasses a wide range of new features and improvements, many of which aim to improve the way that users interact with the Apple Watch itself. New functions such as SOS Emergency attempt to expand the palette of uses that the Apple Watch Series 2 delivers. There is also an increased focus on music, with 2GB made available for storage. Navigation has been made considerably more convenient, while the customization of watch faces is also handled with aplomb. Siri makes a welcome appearance, and delivers the intuitive package that we have come to associate with the personal assistant. In addition, there are several other tweaks and improvements included in watchOS3 that are too numerous to list here. But the overall feeling is of a better user interface and feature set, that enables users to derive far more usage and genuine benefit from this smartwatch. Image shot for ValueWalk by Sheeraz Raza Battery This is one area where Apple could certainly improve on the original Apple Watch, and arguably battery life is even a black mark against the entire range of Apple mobile products. The original Apple Watch had to be charged with far too much regularity, and it is obvious this needed to change rapidly with the second iteration of the series. Thankfully, it can be stated with conviction that the battery life in the Apple Watch Series 2 is much improved over its predecessor. Deriving two days’ worth of charge from the battery included in the Apple Watch Series 2 is perfectly plausible, although the GPS-tracking features do drain the battery significantly more rapidly. By no means does the Apple Watch compare to competitors such as Pebble’s range of smartwatches, which deliver 10 days of battery life on a single charge. But considering the complexity involved, there is no doubt that the Apple Watch Series 2 delivers much better battery life than the original Apple Watch, making it a much more viable everyday wristwatch. Verdict Considering that the Apple Watch Series 2 appears almost physically identical to the first release in the range, it would be easy to think that it represents an incremental upgrade. But in reality this second smartwatch release from Apple is a massive improvement on the original. It scores heavily in both convenience and performance, while the new features and functionality ensure that this is now a credible sports and fitness device, rather than a limited and trivial tracker, as was pretty much the case with its predecessor. Usability has also been significantly improved, and the next generation operating system delivers several nifty bells and whistles. It is also notable that the Apple Watch Series 2 is more durable than its predecessor, while the ability to take it underwater provides welcome additional flexibility. In short, this is undoubtedly the best smartwatch available on the market, and one that will inevitably result in Apple’s existing hegemony of the market solidifying still further.

Catch up on past installments here.  This week’s EduTech is a guest post from Apple Distinguished Educator Michael Cohen, founder of The Tech Rabbi. Apple’s Distinguished Educator program recognizes professionals who are using Apple to “transform teaching and learning.”  When Apple announced the Swift programming language at WWDC in 2014, they aimed to change the way developers program forever. Promoted as a more resilient and flexible language, it was adopted, refined, and for the most part embraced. Less than 3 years later, Apple is set to revolutionize the way we program again. This time it’s not through veteran programmers, it’s through 9-16 year old students. Through programming, coding, and as President Obama put it #CS4ALL, Apple has a chance to redefine and crown itself again as a unstoppable technological force in education. Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover Apple aims to achieve this through a relatively new education platform called Swift Playgrounds. Swift Playgrounds is inspired by current coding trends in education, but in true Apple form has been redesigned to be real world applicable and relevant beyond the platform itself. Swift Playgrounds is a game-based experience that teaches the Swift language and challenges users to masterfully solve a puzzle-like journey, all while programing in the native Swift language. This is unique in the world of coding education. Most programing platforms either lack real program language interaction, or are missing an engaging visual that will show students how their code, even the most basic string, can make things happen. In the words of Apple, they want you to “learn serious code on your iPad in a seriously fun way.” Like any language, coding needs to be learned just like Spanish or Japanese. You need real world expose and practical use. The challenge with coding languages is that stings and strings of code can be left in the abstract until one produces a fully functioning product. In this respect, Swift Playgrounds is taking significant steps towards blending the learning of an authentic coding language through an interactive experience that goes beyond strings of code imputed on a blank screen. It also opens up the world of programming to young, inspired, and ambitious students through the attractive and exciting game experience. Imagine for a moment the median age of a developer dipping into high school because Apple realizes that it needs to invest in 8 year olds, their learning, and their relationship with technology. It also doesn’t end there. Apple isn’t aiming to create a generation of developers, but rather a generation that understands and values what developers, coding, and apps can achieve. These learners will go on to become CEOs, doctors, managers, teachers, and other types of professions that you wouldn’t necessarily associate with “coding.” They will enter these jobs with new skills, insight, and vision for how technology can enhance their professions. This move also solidifies Apple as the company that made this possible. A move that Google and Microsoft are sorely lagging behind even with Microsoft’s acquisition of Minecraft and Google’s mostly unknown Blockly platform. Apple therefore is paving the way for huge adoption of coding in classrooms that will have students ready to create that app or become a masterful problem solver and flaw-finder. By moving beyond the digital experience, programming helps learners develop skills in critical thinking, complex program solving, and creativity. These skills will be vital in a future full of automation, robots, and artificial intelligence. For education, today’s coding apps are going beyond digital experiences and offer creative ways to develop important professional (and honestly, life) skills that are critical for today and tomorrow’s rapidly changing workforce and industry. These skills might even have a chance to develop to a higher degree through programming even if students are not considering it as their professional goal. Even more so, organizations like the World Economic Forum see those skills as prerequisites to thrive in the future workforce – one that doesn’t yet exist. This future is, of course, where our elementary school students will finish college and enter the world of work that we must prepare them for today. Programing is part and parcel of all emerging and cutting-edge technologies. Let’s not undercut the tens of thousands of programming and computer science related jobs that are currently unfilled. On a personal level, the social, emotional, and economic elements of our lives are directly impacted by what programing can achieve. It goes beyond the technological functions, and becomes a catalyst for how people think, envision, and ideate what programming can do to influence and enhance the world around us. Keep in mind, this is just the start. Programming in education and its impact on real-world programing and development is still an developing and the road is mostly uncharted. What is certain is Apple’s leading role in once again changing how we experience, interface, and produce with technology in a meaningful way.

The extended warranty is specific to the battery and does not appear to cover other potential problems that might arise. It does not appear that Apple is notifying registered Apple Watch owners directly about the extended warranty coverage, and is instead making sure that its employees are up to date on the new policy. "Apple has extended service coverage for eligible Apple Watch (1st gen) models with an expanded/swollen battery to three years after the original date of purchase. Eligible devices will be covered for two years beyond the original 1-year limited warranty," Apple states in an internal memo. Source: Apple's Support Forum (w83design) The issue has been documented by users on Apple's support forums. Those experiencing the problem note that the swollen battery pushes the display up. The same discussion can also be found on Reddit, with one user noting he woke up to a pop sound coming from his nightstand. When he picked up his Apple Watch, he said it felt noticeably hotter than usual, though not enough to cause a burn. Batteries in mobile products have been under additional scrutiny ever since Samsung had to recall its Galaxy Note 7 line due to exploding handsets. Samsung now has a new program in place that more rigorously tests for and certifies batteries to prevent future issues, but there is still the concern that burning incidents could happen with any mobile product with a lithium ion battery back inside. In this case, a Reddit user who claims to be an "Apple technician specialist" says that Apple Watch "batteries are carefully designed not to rupture in even of expansion failure" and that it would take the "wrong impact damage to the display enclosure to puncture that thing and spew hot battery goo on anybody." Sounds comforting, doesn't it? In any event, if you own a first generation Apple Watch and notice it bulging, get in touch with Apple about having it replace or repaired.

Earlier this month, reports started circulating about the problem. Owners of the new MacBook Pro, released in 2016, say they're hearing a strange noise coming from their devices intermittently. The issue appears to be primarily affecting 15-inch MacBook Pros, though there have been reports of it happening to the 13-inch MacBook Pro too. It's also not clear exactly how many people are affected, though the issue seems to relatively widespread. There are numerous support forum threads from disgruntled customers online, and after I wrote about the problem two weeks ago nearly half a dozen people emailed me to say their laptops were also affected. Apple, meanwhile, is staying silent. When I first reached out to the company's comms team, a spokesperson said they'd get back to me. After I followed up earlier this week, they said that they've got "nothing to add." In the absence of public comment from Apple, affected users have been left guessing at the possible cause. Some are pointing to heat or thermal expansion of components as a potential reason, noting that it happens when their laptops are under stress. One affected owner said in an email they thought it "didn't seem like anything major to me," but they had "bought a separate hard drive to back everything up [in case] something bad happens. If it gets worse I'll certainly have no choice but to contact them, for whatever good it might do." View photos macbook pro touch barMore salchuiwt/Flickr (CC)Another said it "randomly" happens "everyday" and is "super annoying." A third MacBook Pro owner said it happens "multiple times a day. Notably when i open the laptop — usually after about 30ish seconds, but not every time. And then every 20-100 minutes after that." It's about as loud "as a trackpad click." Users also say they're getting mixed messages from Apple's customer services team. A poster in an Apple support forum thread wrote that when they took their device to Apple's Genius Bar customer service team, a dent on the bottom of their MacBook Pro was blamed, and they had to pay $130 to get it fixed. (Others say their devices are popping even when there's no dent present.) But a poster on Twitter said after they took their MacBook Pro back to Apple, the company replaced it with one that didn't make any weird noises. Another wrote on a support forum they were "working with AppleCare and Engineering now" to try and pin down the problem. There are loads of videos online capturing the noise, like this one: Youtube Embed: http://www.youtube.com/embed/oST0bDjSjDw Width: 560px Height: 315px For now, there's no hard evidence that the popping sound is evidence of a deeper problem — but it's easy to see why it might be alarming to someone who has spent upwards of $2,399 (or £2,349) for their shiny new 15-inch MacBook Pro. If in doubt, it might be wise to talk to Apple Support just in case. Is your MacBook Pro playing up?

Rumors are circulating about an iPhone is basically an edge-to-edge, top-to-bottom device that is screen, all screen, and nothing but a screen. It’s compelling. LG and Samsung have already come pretty darn close. Can Apple cross the finish line? That remains to be seen. But what, then, would happen to arguably one of the most iconic parts of the iPhone – the home button/fingerprint sensor? That’s what we’re here to talk about. Unlike most of our debates, this isn’t a binary choice. It’s not A or B. There are a few different options to consider, and I’m going to do my best to lay those out for you here. What should Apple do with that home button and fingerprint sensor that has been gracing the front of every phone and tablet it has produced in the past 10 years? It’s not an easy decision – not by any stretch. Keep it right there The first option is of course to keep it right where it is. Sure, an edge-to-edge screen would be killer – and a device whose face was all screen would be absolutely luxurious. But this is the squircle we’re talking about here. Sure, the button is just round these days, but getting rid of the button would be a major departure from the most basic design component left on the iconic phone. Evolution has to happen, right? Maybe. But maybe we’re not there yet either. Of course, we could just make the button smaller, and more Galaxy S7 like. Keeping the home button with a rounded rectangle shape might be a decent way to go, allowing for a much more extensive screen, while retaining that design element. Might be a touch too ironic though for the company that has been suing Samsung for years now to suddenly steal its home button. Underneath the skin I’m inclined to think that if the screen is as extensive as rumors suggest, then that home button is toast. So what’s left? There are numerous companies – including Apple – that are working on embedding the fingerprint sensor below the front glass. This kind of sensor would obviously allow for the fingerprint sensor to remain, along with an Android-like home button that is software driven. Heck, the lock screen could even have an image that depicts the famed home button to wake the phone up when needed. Plus, there’s other tech out there that would allow for the entire screen to be a fingerprint sensor. Or, Apple could take a page from other Android OEMs and mount its home button/sensor on the back of the device. Wouldn’t that be something to see? A rear-mounted fingerprint sensor makes a lot of sense – your fingers end up there anyway, especially with a screen as extensive as is rumored. Plus, Apple relies very heavily on its home button – too heavily if you ask me – so it’ll need some way to keep that functionality going. Kill it with fire There is one last option on Apple’s menu – kill it completely. Samsung has shown that phones can be unlocked in a variety of ways – fingerprint, facial recognition, iris scanning. It’s all pretty solid, and if I know Apple, it will get those methods down to a science. It’ll be “automagical and stuff”. I don’t doubt that Apple is capable of making biometric security pretty close to bulletproof, because it would have to be. But these are not waters in which Apple has dipped its toe yet, so it would be a huge risk. But maybe it would be worth it. That’s assuming these rumors are even close to true. This is another way that this debate is a little different – it’s all theoretical. But we’ve had some heavy discussions of late, so maybe we can be a little lighter on this one. What do you think will ultimately happen to Apple’s home button and fingerprint sensor? Will it wind up on the back of the device? Perhaps it will be smaller? Will Apple stubbornly hold on to it come hell or high water? Will Apple kill the whole thing in favor of other biometrics? Sound off below with your thoughts. If you have any other ideas on what it could do, include those as well. All options are on the table, so let’s see if we can figure this out. Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

We’ll offer a few automatic solutions so you can confidently takes photos and now they’ll end up on your laptop or desktop computer within minutes. The key word in this process is “automatically” syncing photos. Anyone can plug their phone into their Mac or PC and back up the photos manually from the phone to the computer. Mac uses the Photos app for this and on Windows you can set it up to back up to Windows. Follow the steps listed on Apple’s support site to do that on either platform manually. Upload iPhone Photos to Photo Sharing Sites You can upload iPhone Photos to photo sharing sites like Flickr, Facebook, 500px and others. Many may not know that a lot of these services offer an automatic back-up for iPhone photos. For example, Flickr is the best service left in the Yahoo universe. The Flickr iOS app has a setting that lets users automatically upload their photos. Install Flickr and sign into your Yahoo account. Then select the last tab on the right across the bottom of the app. It shows your account and photos uploaded to Flickr already. Tap on the settings icon in the upper right corner. The first item in the settings screen says Auto-Uploadr. The next screen shows two settings buttons. Turn them both on so they turn blue. The first one says Auto-Upload photos, which does what it says. The second one does this over cellular. You can keep that off if you don’t want to use your data plan. It will only upload when you’re connected to a Wi-Fi network. Other apps work similarly. Lightroom from Adobe can automatically backup photos to your Adobe Creative Cloud account. It takes some setting up, but works really well. Open Lightroom for iPhone and sign into your Adobe Creative Cloud account. Do this by tapping on the Lr icon in the upper left corner. After signing in, turn on Auto Add Photos. If you don’t want to sync using your cellular data connection, then turn on Sync Only Over Wi-Fi as well. Exit the settings area by tapping on the right edge of the screen. Now tap on the Plus icon in the upper right corner and create a new Collection. Name it something like “iPhone Backup” and tap on OK. Scroll down to the new Collection you just created and tap on the three horizontal dots icon to the right of the name of your Collection. Tap on Enable Auto Add. Lightroom and Flickr offer two great services to automatically backup your iPhone photos. If you use another online service, then you can probably set it up to automatically backup iPhone photos. Facebook stopped supporting this within the Facebook app, but their Moments app still does. Using these services means you can find your photos by going online to the service you chose. If you install Lightroom on your Mac or PC, then the iPhone Backup Collection will sync automatically to the computer or you can use the online version of Lightroom. Let iCloud Handle iPhone Photos Backup to Mac or PC The iCloud Photo sync gives users a simple way to upload and back up photos to Apple’s services. The user can then open their Mac’s Photos app or even sync them to Windows using the Windows iCloud sync client. On a Mac follow our guide to setting up iCloud, part our new Mac setup guide on Notebooks.com. On the iPhone go into Settings and tap on the Apple ID at the top of the screen. Tap on iCloud in the middle of the next screen. The Photos sync settings show up at the top of the list. Tap Photos. Turn iCloud Photo Library to On so it looks green. You probably want to choose Optimize iPhone Storage instead of Download and Keep Originals. This preserves storage space on the iPhone so you don’t over fill it with your Photos library. You can see thumbnails of your photos in the Photos app, but the full-size originals stay on iCloud. You should now turn on Upload to My Photo Stream. This automatically backs up all your photos to iCloud. If you like to take Burst shots (taking multiple shots by holding down the shutter release button in the Camera app) and want to save them, turn on Upload Burst Photos, too. The last item on the list of settings lets users share their Photos by turning on iCloud Photo Sharing. Turn this on if you plan to share photos with others. These settings will keep all your photos backed up to iCloud so you can open them on your Mac or PC. AirDrop iPhone Photos to a Mac If you don’t like the idea of automatically sharing Photos to a cloud service or even iCloud from Apple, then you can manually send photos to your Mac without ever connecting the iPhone via cable. AirDrop does a nice job of quickly moving photos from the iPhone to a Mac. Open up Photos on the iPhone and select some photos. You can tap on the word Select above a group of photos to quickly Select all the photos in the group. Or tap on each photo you want to share using AirDrop. In the lower left corner you’ll see an icon that looks like a box with an arrow pointing up. That’s the sharing icon. Tap it and then find your Mac on the next screen in the middle of the screen. Tap on it and the photos will quickly copy over to the Mac’s Downloads folder. There’s An App for That Multiple apps will also automatically upload photos backing them up to various syncing and backup services. Here’s a list of the most notable apps that include automatic photo uploading and backing up. We’ve already mentioned Flickr and Adobe Lightroom above.

It’s a Bluetooth device, so you should go into the Bluetooth settings, right? Unfortunately, that doesn’t work. Instead we’ll show you how to pair the Apple Pencil with the either the 12.9-inch iPad Pro or the smaller 9.7-inch iPad Pro introduced half a year after the larger iPad Pro. We also show user how to charge it using either the iPad Pro or your iPad Pro charging cable. How to Pair Apple Pencil to iPad Pro Pairing or connecting the Apple Pencil with the iPad Pro is simple. First, turn on Bluetooth in the Settings on the iPad Pro Blue using the steps below. Open Settings Tap on Bluetooth Tap on the switch next to Bluetooth on the Bluetooth settings screen so that it turns green and the switch moves to the right, if it’s not already turned on Tap Pair when it pops up after connecting Apple Pencil to iPad Pro Next, pull the cap off the top of the Apple Pencil at the end with the aluminum band around it. Be careful to place it in a safe place. That thing is going to get lost for a lot of users if they’re not careful. The cap covers the Apple Pencil’s Lightning connector. Plug the connector into the iPad Pro’s Lightning connector. A button pops up on the iPad Pro screen. It reads “Bluetooth Pairing Request” and asks the user if they would like to pair with the iPad. Tap Pair and this pairs the Pencil with the iPad. To check the pairing process, open the Settings app and tap on Bluetooth. You will see the Apple Pencil listed below the Bluetooth On/Off switch. You will need to plug the Pencil into the iPad Pro again each time you turn off Bluetooth. It reconnects instantly, so plug it in again and it will pair in seconds. Leave it plugged in to top off the battery, which brings us to charging the Pencil. How to Charge the Apple Pencil The Apple Pencil includes a rechargeable battery built-in. It usually comes out of the box with enough power to use it for a while. After the battery drains and the Pencil starts behaving erratically, you’ll need to charge it. It doesn’t take long to charge it when it’s dead, thanks to the fast charging ability. Apple gives users two ways to charge it. First, connect the Apple Pencil to the iPad Pro’s Lightning port like you would if you’re pairing the Apple Pencil. Leave it plugged in for a while to make sure you’ve got enough juice to use it uninterrupted for as long as you plan. Apple promises that 15 seconds of charging will give you half an hour of use. Leave it in for a few minutes to get hours of use. Thanks to the fast charging feature we get when connected to the iPad Pro’s Lightning port, it charged my Apple Pencil from about 75% to 100% in a few minutes. It will go from dead to 100% in less than 10 minutes. Open Notifications on the iPad Pro to see the Apple Pencil battery level. To see how much battery power the Apple Pencil has, plug it into the Lightning port on the iPad and swipe down from the top of the iPad Pro’s screen to see the Today screen in iOS Notifications. Tap the Widgets tab as seen in the screen shot above. The Batteries section shows the iPad’s battery power level and the Pencil’s battery power level by percentage. The second way to charge involves using the tiny Lightning-to-Lightning adapter included in the Apple Pencil retail box (see the white object close to the tip in the image below). It’s another tiny thing to lose, so keep it somewhere safe, like plugged into a Lightning sync/charging cable. Use the tiny adapter to plug the Apple Pencil into a Lightning to USB cable. Plug the adapter to the Apple Pencil’s Lightning connector. Plug the other end of the adapter into a Lightning cable. Plug the Lightning cable’s USB connector into a USB port on a computer, AC adapter, battery backup device or a USB car charger. Unless these support fast charging, it will take the Pencil a lot longer to charge to 100%. Charge Apple Pencil with Moxiware Pencil Charging Dock A third way to charge the Apple Pencil comes from Moxiware, makers of some really great accessories for Apple products. Their Pencil Charging Dock ($29.95) looks like a simple Pencil holder, but it incorporates a user provided Apple Lightning cable and the charging adapter mentioned above. The dock gives instructions for setting it up. After the user sets up their Pencil Charging Dock, they can slide the Apple Pencil into the dock and place the Pencil cap in a hole in the top of the dock. This holds the Apple Pencil and charges it. Bonus Tip: Replace the Apple Pencil Tip The Apple Pencil Tip unscrews so you can replace it with the extra tip that comes in the box. The Pencil tip screws off so that the user can replace it. One spare tip comes with the Apple Pencil. It will likely wear out over time, so save that tip in a safe place where you won’t lose it. I suggest leaving both the tip and the charging adapter in the box the Pencil came in. Put the box in a safe place or carry it in your computer bag. Hopefully, someone will create an inventive solution for carrying the adapter, extra tip and the Pencil all attached to the iPad Pro.     5 Responses 01/27/2016 J.

Is it possible to use any charger with any device? It should be possible to charge any device with a standard Micro USB connector using a standard Micro USB charger. By: Samden Sherpa Published: Sunday, April 30, 2017, 17:53 [IST] Today basically all portable devices be it smartphones, tablets, or laptops come with their own chargers. While there are different types of chargers, most micro-USB connectors and chargers that are shipped with smartphones and tablets are standardized. That may not be the case with PC chargers. However, many have been asking the question if the one can re-use the same charger for multiple devices. Or is it good to use the same charger different devices? Well, this topic can be little confusing but we will look at things that can probably clear our doubts. SEE ALSO:  In any case, let's get down to understanding some basic things and figure out if you can re-use the charger or not. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Different types of Chargers Even though most of the chargers are standardized, there are still a variety of different chargers types available. Firstly there are the Laptop chargers. Unfortunately, chargers for laptops are not standardized. The chargers are different and are designed specifically for a particular model. The final say is that you won't be able to plug any charger with any laptop. Secondly you have Apple Lightning Connector. Apple iPhones, iPads, iPod Touches, iPad Nanos almost all the new iDevices use the Lightning connector and can be connected to any Lightning charger certified or developed by Apple. Moreover, Apple also makes a connector that allows you to connect new devices with a Lightning connector to older charges with a 30-pin dock connector. The last one is the Micro USB Chargers. Well if you consider smartphones today most of them including Android, Windows Phone, and Blackberry phones use standard Micro USB connectors. Can Any Micro USB Charger Charge Any Micro USB Device? Well coming to the main question whether any charger can charge any device. The answer to that, well according to the standardization, all Micro USB chargers and devices are supposed to work together. Therefore chargers can be mixed and matched. For example, if you have a device with a Micro USB port and a Micro USB charger, you should be able to plug the device into any charger and charge. However, the main concern that arises is when moving between different countries. If you're traveling internationally, then it is very important to know the differences between voltages and connectors used around the world. Voltage and Amperage This is an important aspect as failing to know this might cause some damage to your device. Moving forward, basically, all USB connections offer 5 volts of power. And what that means is that you will now have to worry about voltage when connecting a charger to a device over Micro USB. On the other hand, Amperage is a totally different matter. Well Amperage is nothing but the unit used to measure current. Therefore the amps details given in chargers provide how much power the charger supplies. For example, the charger that comes with an Android tablet will likely provide more amps than the charger that comes with an Android smartphone. Therefore you should know the charger's amperage as it is the maximum power that the device can take. Safety Concerns Most micro-USB chargers usually come with "UL Listed" logo on them. What this means is that they have been tested for safety, so they won't overheat and catch fire or electrocute you if you use the same charger with different devices. However, sometime even approved chargers can cause problems which might be actually due to having faulty batteries. But in any case you shouldn't use any sort of charger that has been recalled or mostly cloned ones. And chargers that haven't been certified are a major concern. The main point here is that you shouldn't use unofficial batteries ordered directly from factories in China and that you shouldn't use uncertified chargers that haven't been tested for safety. Conclusion The final verdict is that it should be possible to charge any device with a standard Micro USB connector using a standard Micro USB charger. While there's a standard for most of the chargers some devices may not charge with some chargers. This might be because some devices may not be following the standard.

(Staten Island Advance/Claire Regan) By Claire M. Regan STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Move over, Apple CEO Tim Cook. Paul Sebastian Jara wants your job. He may only be 10, but a future in technology is on the horizon for this confident and articulate fourth-grader, a member of the tech squad at PS 21 in Elm Park. Under the direction of media library teacher Patricia Wong, Paul has become as familiar with Google docs, GIFs and links as he is with fractions, adverbs and the American Revolution. "I learned how to type before I learned how to print," boasts Paul, who uses a MacBook Pro at home. "I'm gonna work for Apple because it's No. 1 in technology." Paul Sebastian Jara, a PS 21 fourth-grader, plans to be a computer engineer and work for Apple. (Staten Island Advance/Claire Regan) He and his tech squad pals, Luis Davila and Mario Solis, have decided they will major in computer engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken and room together in the dormitory. Technology is a priority at PS 21, where all teachers use SMART Boards and students work on laptops in a second-floor media library. Next year, every classroom will be equipped with Google Chromebooks and the lower grades will have access to iPads. New SMART Boards for the school are on the way, thanks to funding from Borough President James Oddo and Councilwoman Debi Rose. The auditorium in 111-year-old PS 21 features wooden seats and other historic details. Principal Anthony Cosentino, center, is joined by Allison Graham, left, assistant principal, and Melissa Neglia, teacher and UFT chapter chair leader. (Staten Island Advance/Claire Regan) "We are preparing them for jobs that do not exist yet," says Anthony Cosentino, finishing his second year as PS 21's forward-thinking principal. "We want to give them a wide range of skills for jobs that will be available 20 years from now. We want our kids to be more marketable." The school has built its own website and uses Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to share news and accomplishments. Located on Hooker Place, in the shadow of the Bayonne Bridge and a few blocks from Port Richmond High School, PS 21 was built 111 years ago with separate entrances marked "Girls" and "Boys." A small annex was added in 1996. Zion Tobee and Sariya Harris are kindergarten mathematicians at PS 21. (Staten Island Advance/Claire Regan) Most classrooms are in the original two-story building, which features the perfect mix of modern amenities and old-world charm. A petite auditorium accommodates 200 in vintage wooden seats; the stage has built-in benches with cushions. PS 21's 20th-century architects did not include a gymnasium in the design, but that doesn't bother physical education teacher Melissa Neglia who makes use of the spacious school yard for her classes. NURTURING ENVIRONMENT "Good morning, Mr. C!" the fifth-grade class recites in perfect unison as Principal Cosentino pays a visit on a recent Friday morning. First-graders Alexandra Hernandez-Pavia and Iris Camacho visit with PS 21 Principal Anthony Cosentino, affectionately known as "Mr. C" in the Elm Park school. (Staten Island Advance/Claire Regan) Energetic and athletic, 35-year-old Cosentino logs a few miles every day inside his school building, spending more time fist-bumping his 382 students and greeting visiting parents than seated in his office. His staff includes one assistant principal and 33 teachers. "The staff is a great team," he says with characteristic humility. "They are really invested in what we're trying to do here. I'm very fortunate as a principal." Cosentino fosters a family atmosphere and welcomes "pop-up moms" like Janet Rosa who frequently stop by to check on a child's progress. Janet Rosa gathers with her five children, all students at PS 21. In the front are Elijah DelCampo, Joshua Angelette, Joseph Angelette and Venus Angelette. Standing next to his mom is fifth-grader Aziz Thomas. (Staten Island Advance/Claire Regan) "I peek in (the classroom door) and try to catch my oldest to see what he's doing," explains Rosa about fifth-grader Aziz Thomas. "I watch him interact." "This school is a second home for many kids; they can't wait to come here" she continues. "Mr. C makes kids and parents feel comfortable. If there is an issue, he'll drop what he's doing and address it." "I wish this school went to eighth grade," she adds, noting that Aziz, the eldest of five siblings at PS 21, heads off to junior high next year. Caroline Blake, left, Santiago Barrios and Christopher Espinel learn about right angles in fourth-grade math class. (Staten Island Advance/Claire Regan) Principal Cosentino recently introduced My Hero and Me, an eight-week program that celebrates fatherhood and fosters positive role modeling. Kids and dads bond during a different after-school activity each week, including martial arts, break dancing, jiu-jitsu, woodworking and basketball. "It gets more fathers into the building," says Charles Fernando, who has served as PS 21's guidance counselor "for six happy years." Cultivating good citizens is also a priority at the Elm Park school. After a vigorous campaign season that coincided with the national election season last fall, class leaders were elected in all grades based on the strength of their platforms and speeches. PS 21 fifth-grader Lester Collins joins science teacher Maria Littreal before class begins. (Staten Island Advance/Claire Regan) PS 21 students develop an awareness of the environment in Maria Littreal's science classes where they learn about recycling and organics and how to save energy. PS 21 this year reduced energy usage by 19 percent and won the Green Design Lab Energy Challenge sponsored by the Department of Education (DOE). PS 21 is also a Zero Waste School, recognized by the city Department of Sanitation for its recycling and sustainability efforts. DEGREE IN PHILOSOPHY A native of the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, Principal Cosentino moved to West Brighton with his family when he was 9 years old. Principal Cosentino visits with PS 21 kitchen staffers Monica Bruno, left, Edward Levin and Jeanne Galano. (Staten Island Advance/Claire Regan) He graduated from Blessed Sacrament School and Monsignor Farrell High School and earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Fordham University and a master's degree in education from Wagner College. He later completed the DOE's Leaders in Education Apprenticeship Program and the Advanced Leadership Program for Assistant Principals, sponsored by the Council of School Supervisors and Administrators. Cosentino worked for a year at Geller House, the intervention center for adolescents in Arrochar, then at Monsignor Farrell before transitioning into the public school system with a teaching position at the Hungerford School Annex in New Springville. He served as an assistant principal in Brooklyn for three-and-a-half years and was appointed principal of PS 21 in summer 2015. Third-graders McKayla Rolon and Leanna Collins are eager to see the seeds they planted grow into radishes. (Staten Island Advance/Claire Regan) "We've made a lot of progress in 18 months," he says, referring to a 13-percent jump in English Language Arts (ELA) test scores and a 10-percent increase in science test scores. PS 21 has been recognized by the DOE as a Respect for All School in recognition of its work to promote a community of inclusion. A rich after-school program offers crocheting, Zumba, calligraphy, coding, robotics and cooking. Next year, a college and career readiness office will open at PS 21, sponsored by the Wagner College Port Richmond Partnership. It will be the first of its kind in a New York State elementary school, Principal Cosentino points out, enabling PS 21 to collaborate with Markham Intermediate School and Port Richmond High School, also participants in the Wagner initiative. "When students leave PS 21, we want them to know that college is not just a possibility, it's an expectation," he says.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology Companies Apple urges California to amend self-driving car test policy Waymo, Ford motors, Uber, Toyota and Tesla have also suggested changes in the proposed policy. By Sarmistha Acharya April 30, 2017 13:11 BST Apple urges changes to self-driving car test policyGetty Images/Kena Betancur Apple has urged California to amend its policy on testing self-driving cars. In a letter written to Brian G Soublet, chief counsel at the Department of Motor Vehicles, that was made public on Friday (28 April), Apple suggested a series of changes to the draft policy. It said it wants to work with California and others "so that rapid technology development may be realised while ensuring the safety of the travelling public". In the letter, Apple said California should revise how companies report self-driving system "disengagements". The state requires companies to report how many times the self-driving system was deactivated and the control was taken over by humans due to system failure, traffic situation, weather and road conditions, Reuters reports. The company has asked the regulators to revisit the language to define an autonomous vehicle to clarify that permits are required in advanced systems even when there is a safety driver. Apple said the rules for development vehicles used only in testing could "restrict both the design and equipment that can be used in test vehicles". Apple was granted a permit to test autonomous vehicles in California earlier this month. It has recruited dozens of auto experts. Waymo, Ford Motor, Uber technologies, Toyota Motor, Tesla Motor and others have also filed comments suggesting changes. California has said it would review the comments before introducing any change to the policy that is aimed at allowing companies to test self-driving cars. Tesla said the state should not prohibit testing of autonomous vehicles that are 10,000 pounds (4,535 kg) or more. It said such a move could "still innovation" and bar a company from testing a heavy autonomous vehicle. Tesla also said that California should not prohibit the sale of non-self-driving vehicles previously used for autonomous vehicle testing. Uber said California should allow paying members to ride in autonomous vehicles with drivers. "There is no reason to deny those riders an opportunity to travel in an autonomous test vehicle and provide honest feedback," the company said. Waymo said California should remove its liability proposal. General Motors said automakers should be allowed to reuse autonomous vehicles and parts after testing.

Phone leaker Sonny Dickson tweeted Thursday that the device, which would run using the company’s voice assistant Siri and its AirPlay functionality, would use the Siri voice assistant and AirPlay functionality.  Read: Apple smart speaker in the works? He further said that the device would use the company’s Beats Audio technology and will run on iOS. While Apple is still mum on the device’s existence, let alone its features, there are chances that the company could launch the device at the World Wide Developers Conference in June in San Francisco. Here are five expected specs of the device: Facial recognition tech: According to CNET, the device might have a built-in camera like the Amazon Echo Look to detect multiple users. Voice-based smart speakers such as Amazon Echo and Google Home have a problem doing so and sometimes get confused between voices. A built-in camera would help the speakers respond to both visual and audio input, which means differentiating between users will be much easier.    Beats Audio: Apple’s devices have generally received good feedback for their audio and the company has its own wireless earphones, AirPods, which it sells separately for $159. So, its eventual move towards speakers is not unexpected. The company is expected to employ Beats Audio technology in the speaker, which could have a concave Mac Pro-like design with audio and other controls at the concave top. Beats Audio is the name for signature noise-cancelling technology that Apple uses in its devices to provide its users with clear audio. For the speaker, it might involve the use of components such as high-grade plastic and insulated wires to ensure clear audio. Touchscreen: Unlike Google and Amazon’s devices, Apple is not just making a smart speaker that responds to your voice, but one that is iOS-based. This means that the device will have a touchscreen, which would give you access to multiple apps at once. Say, for example you use the Nike+ running app. You might be able to get the speaker to simply put out your running targets and tell you how far you are from your goal by connecting to the app. Improved Siri: Apple has been expected to have an improved version of Siri for some time to match up with the evolving functionality of the Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, apart from other artificial intelligence based voice assistants such as Cortana. The company could probably unveil an improved version of Siri, which would be designed to support the smart speaker. Read: Apple’s Self Driving Car In The Works? Smart home functionality: The essential reason behind Apple designing a smart speaker is its goal of creating a smart Home, something CEO Tim Cook has indicated many times in the past. The Apple smart speaker is expected to be compatible with its HomeKit framework for communicating and controlling connected devices.        Related Stories What Are Sheeple?

This came only a quarter after the Seoul-based tech titan narrowly yielded its leading status to Apple during the October-December period last year. In the first quarter, Samsung sold 79.2 million smartphones across the globe, with Apple coming in second with 51.6 million, the market researcher said. The gap is expected to widen in the coming quarters, as Samsung's flagship Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus hit the shelves this month. The premium handsets are gaining enthusiastic market responses, posting a series of sales records in the firm's key revenue markets — Korea and the United States. The outlook for Samsung appears bright for the time being, as Apple reportedly does not have plans to unveil its new flagship iPhone 8 until the third quarter. IDC cited Samsung's diverse product lineup as a key driving force for the decent quarterly sales. "The Galaxy J and A series drove significant volumes in both emerging and developed markets thanks to their flagship-like design and more affordable price," said the market tracker. It expects Samsung to continue to report firmer smartphone sales in the second quarter. "An early positive response to the recently launched S8 and S8 Plus looks promising, as it may have finally put Samsung's Note 7 fiasco to bed." Earlier this month, the Samsung flagship smartphones stunned the local mobile industry by setting a record pre-order of some 1 million here. Pre-orders for the S8 and S8 Plus also reported 30 percent growth year-on-year, compared with its predecessor, the Galaxy S7, in the United States. Market analysts here also say that the new smartphones will prop up Samsung to set a record profit in the second quarter. "Samsung Electronics is expected to post more than 12 trillion won ($10.52 billion) in operating profit in the April to June period, driven by a sharp increase in its mobile unit's earnings," Dongbu Securities analyst Kwon Sung-ryul said. Samsung's mobile division reported 2.07 trillion won in operating profit in the first-quarter, down 46.8 percent from a year ago. This reflects the global recall of the Note 7, with Samsung failing to chalk up outstanding mobile profits since the second half of last year. But the S8 and S8 Plus will likely help the mobile unit bounce back in the upcoming quarters, according to observers. Eugene Investment & Securities analyst Lee Jeong said: "Samsung's handset division will report an outstanding profit growth in the second quarter with the arrivals of new flagship devices." He expected the company to report 13.56 trillion won in second-quarter operating profit, up 37 percent quarter-on-quarter. mhlee@ktimes.comMore articles by this reporter N.

More tech earnings: Once again, it’s a big week for tech. Apple is reporting second quarterly earnings on Tuesday, and Facebook and Tesla are both reporting first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Apple has a lot to live up to — after three straight year-over-year sales declines, the company finally started growing again in the first quarter. Since then, the tech giant’s stock hit an all-time high. Tesla’s also been having a good streak. In April, it inched past GM to become the most valuable carmaker in America. And even though Tesla’s earnings have been spotty in the past — Elon Musk’s electric car company doesn’t usually post a profit — its market value remains strong. When we last heard from Facebook, we learned that it’s zeroing in on the two-billion-user mark. Maybe we’ll learn on Wednesday if it’s hit that milestone. Jobs report: The April jobs report is coming on Friday. Since Trump took office, the U.S. job outlook has been fairly sunny. In February, his first full month as president, unemployment fell from 4.8% to 4.7%. That figure fell again in March, down to 4.5%. The rate of hires, however, has been slowing. While the U.S. added 235,000 jobs in February, it only added 98,000 jobs last month. Plus, the economy is growing at a sluggish pace, and in Trump’s first 100 days in office U.S. companies have continued to hire abroad.

(Reuters/Maxim Shemetov) Share Written by Leslie Josephs Obsession Getting There April 30, 2017 In 1913, Henry Ford’s moving assembly line slashed the production time of a Model T—and with it, the price. Ford Motor Company eventually sold around 15 million units of the world’s first mass-market car before it discontinued production in 1927. After World War II, Ford rolled out new models, including trucks, for their increasingly demanding—and wealthier—consumers. This consumer group coveted the vehicles as a luxury, but also needed them to travel from their brand-new suburban neighborhoods to the workplace. The Model T has come and gone, but Ford has held onto its crown as the purveyor of the best-selling vehicle in America for decades. Thanks to Americans’ love of giant cars, Ford’s F-series pickup truck has been the best-selling vehicle in the US for 35 years. But while Ford spent more than a century successfully getting as many cars as possible onto the world’s roads, it’s now realizing that it may have to help take a few cars back off. The auto industry is now challenged worldwide—traffic-and pollution choked cities have led city governments to limit the number of vehicles on their streets. Meanwhile, more and more potential consumers are deciding they just don’t need to own a car. Apple, a company 73 years Ford’s junior, has been down this road before. While Apple originally sold user-friendly computers, it rose to prominence (and value) by diversifying. This means Apple realized it had to do more than just sell products like the (now ubiquitous) iPhone—it needed to branch out into services that could withstand the seasonal market trends of personal electronics sales. And so, over the past 14 years Apple has developed reliable revenue streams from its online marketplaces for apps, music, and other forms of entertainment, as well as its payment platform. Now Ford is refocusing its business in a similar way. “For many years, it was always about how many vehicles you can we get through a certain area, whereas now we flip that on its head, and say how many people can you get through a certain area?” Ford’s CEO Mark Fields tells Quartz. “Our view is that there will be less vehicle density.” To start, Ford is exploring commercial driverless vehicles, ride sharing, and investing in automobile software. It has also invested in the bike-sharing company Motivate. Last year, Ford acquired San Francisco upstart Chariot, an on-demand van for ride-sharing commuters. The company says it expects to expand the service to include eight cities this year. Fields estimates that every Chariot van on the road takes 25 cars off of it. For those with access to a Ford vehicle, Fields envisions more revenue coming from “digital services” like its FordPass app, which allows users to view parking options ahead of time and also schedules oil-change and other maintenance appointments automatically by syncing up with the driver’s calendar. On some models it can even start the vehicle. Now Ford thinks it needs a broader business if it wants to remain relevant in the future. “We’re looking at the increase in pollution and looking at changing consumer habits of people going from the mindset of owning vehicles to owning and sharing, and in many urban areas, having access versus ownership,” Fields says, adding that congestion is an economic threat to cities. Ford isn’t alone in this race to diversify its business. Competitors like General Motors and Audi are similarly launching car-sharing programs and investing in platforms that cater to a generation of consumers that may not have the funds or desire to own a vehicle. “Any business has to look 10, 15 years out,” Fields said. While Ford is changing its business model to look a bit more like Apple’s, it may one day encounter the tech giant on its home turf: Apple recently began testing autonomous-car technology.

Brad Ideas Crazy ideas, inventions and essays from Brad Templeton. Computers, Robocars, Civil Rights, Photography and more. Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars No, Detroit is not winning the robocar race. Submitted by brad on Mon, 2017-04-03 17:30. Robocars A new report from Navigant Research includes the chart shown below, ranking various teams on the race to robocar deployment. It’s causing lots of press headlines about how Ford is the top company and companies like Google and Uber are far behind. I elected not to buy the $3800 report, but based on the summary I believe their conclusions are ill founded to say the least. This ordering smacks of old-world car industry thinking. Saying that Ford and GM are ahead of Waymo/Google is like saying that Foxconn is ahead of Google or Apple in the smartphone market. Foxconn makes the iPhone of course, and makes lots of money at a modest profit margin of a few percent. Apple and Google don’t make their phones, they design them and the software platform. Ford and GM might feel good reading this report, but they should not. I do actually like Ford’s plan quite a bit — especially their declaration that they will not sell their robocar to end-users. I also like Daimler’s declaration that they want to have a taxi style service called “Car2Come” after their Car2Go one-way on-demand car rental service. (Americans giggle at the name, Germans are never bothered by such things. :-) GM does not belong high on the list, other than for its partnership with Lyft. They were wise to acquire a company like Cruise — and I know the folks at Cruise, this is not a criticism of them — but it’s not enough to catapult you to the front of the list. A similar article came out a few months ago, declaring that Silicon Valley was sure to lose to Detroit, because Detroit knows how to make cars, and Silicon Valley doesn’t. The report went further and declared that Google was falling behind because they had said they did not plan to make a car. The author had mistakenly thought Google had plans to make a car — Google never said anything like that — and so decided that the announcement that they would not make one was a big retreat on their part. Companies like Google, Apple and Uber have never stated they wished to make cars, or felt they were any good at it. If they want to make cars, they have the cash to go buy a car company, but there is no need to do that. There are a couple of dozen companies around the world who are already very good at making cars, and if you come to them with an order for 100,000 cars to your specification, they will jump to say “yes, sir!” Some of the companies, the big leaders like Toyota or BMW, might well refuse that order, not wanting to be the supplier for a threat to their existence. But it won’t help them. Somebody will be that supplier. If not a German, Japanese or U.S. company, then a Korean company, or failing that a Chinese company. In fact, Foxconn has said it is interested in making cars, and Apple is designing them, so the Apple-Foxconn relationship may be far more than a metaphor for this situation. When you summon an Uber, you don’t care what nameplate is on the car. When you summon UberSelect, you don’t care if it’s Lexus, or Mercedes or BMW. Uber was your brand, and you aren’t buying the car for 15 years, you are buying it for 15 minutes. Brand plays a completely different role. Companies like Waymo, Apple, Uber, Zoox and others would be foolish to manufacture cars, unless they want a car so radically different that nobody knows how to make it. (Then, they might decide to be the first to figure it out.) The car manufacturers would be foolish to turn down the giant purchase order, or partnerships with whoever has the best technology. The winner of the transportation game of the future will be the company that thinks outside the car. That doesn’t mean the big car companies can’t do that. It’s just harder for them to do. The chart’s not entirely wrong. Honda is pretty far behind — but PSA is even further behind. BMW, Daimler and Ford are among the best of the car companies, but Tesla and Volvo deserve higher ranking. Hyundai is not ahead of Toyota, and Tesla, while not ahead of Waymo, is in a pretty good place. Bosch is a surprising absentee from the list. FCA should be on it, just very low on the chart, along with the smaller Japanese vendors and many Chinese vendors. But be clear. Making the car is essential, but it’s also old and a commodity. The value will lie in those building the self-driving software systems and sensors, and those putting services together around the technologies. The big automaker’s advantages — nameplate and reputation, reliability, manufacturing skill and capacity, retail channel experience — these are all less valuable or commoditized. They have to act fast to move to new business models that will make it in the future. Of course, one plan is to own the important components I name above, and several companies like BMW, Daimler, Ford, Nissan and Volvo are trying to do that. But they’re behind Waymo by a fair distance. » brad's blog My bet is Tesla is leading the race Submitted by Alnair (not verified) on Tue, 2017-04-04 02:16. Because autonomous driving is based on machine learning algorithms (similar to algorithms that use Google for the search engine) and provided the most data you have, the better result you get from those algorithms, a company that delivers 100K cars/year (soon 300K) with all hardware for autonomous driving capable to work in shadow mode gathering data from all his costumers around the world will soon overpass all the competition by large. That company is Tesla. I no doubt Waymo will be the best autonomous car in Palo Alto roads, but world is much more diverse and to learn all possible scenarios you need hundreds of thousands cars, not just hundreds. » reply Often said Submitted by brad on Tue, 2017-04-04 09:05. But if you go around the industry and ask the question, “Which company is the clear leader in machine learning and neural network technologies?” The answer will almost universally be “Google.” So do you really imagine that Tesla would be so far ahead of Waymo on that? That Waymo, even though recently put into its own company, has not made use of that skill? Why would they not? » reply automated transport Submitted by jim (not verified) on Thu, 2017-04-06 11:08. If you rephrase the question as "Which company is likely to profit the most from automated transportation in the next ~15 years? I would respond : Amazon I would think that automating the package delivery business is a better defined and easier problem than automating taxies. And Amazon is well on its way automating the package delivery business. I would be surprised if they don't already have a plan in place to cut the labor cost of delivering a package by a factor of 10 in the next 10 years. » reply Online retail Submitted by brad on Fri, 2017-04-07 09:40. Will indeed profit nicely, but it’s small compared to personal transportation. Delivery services around the world are a few hundred billion dollars. Personal transport is 5 trillion. » reply OEMs are the wrong segment to examine Submitted by Alison Chaiken (not verified) on Sat, 2017-04-29 22:48. The popular press always ranks automakers since the public knows their names and will buy the reports. In automotive ecosystem, this is wrong thinking. The companies that are really developing the technology are not just the Sili Valley favorites, but also Tier 1's and Tier 2's like Continental, Bosch (as you astutely point out) and Nvidia. Both Tesla and Audi run Nvidia's Tegra, making me wonder how different their systems really are. comma.ai also ran with the Nvidia Jetson board. BMW has partnered with Intel and Mobileye. Perhaps if the autonomy gold rush falters, Conti, Bosch, Harman, Nvidia and Intel will profit most. » reply Nvidia as a base Submitted by brad on Sun, 2017-04-30 02:30. Nvidia GPUs are, from this viewpoint, general purpose massively multicore processors. It’s all in the software, so there does not have to be any similarity in how Tesla and Audi and comma.ai use them. Now they are all doing neural networks with them but that’s again a platform rather than an algorithm. Tier Ones are working on it, but OEMs are scared of not owning what may become the more important tech in the car. » reply Comment viewing options Flat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expanded Date - newest firstDate - oldest first 10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes.

Uber seems to dominate business journalism these days only slightly less than Donald Trump dominates everything else. There are endless tales of the glitzy car-service-app provider and its pugnacious founder and CEO, Travis Kalanick, that portray it as the Death Star of the sharing economy. In that regard, “Uber’s CEO Plays With Fire,” in the New York Times, doesn’t break new thematic ground. Yet it’s well worth reading, if only for the scene of Kalanick reprimanded by Apple CEO Tim Cook for violating Apple’s rules by tagging iPhones even after customers had deleted Uber’s app. Some of the episodes described here have been told before, but others—including that Kalanick was bullied as a child and that he once sold knives door-to-door—were new (at least, to me). The article argues that “Travis Kalanick’s drive to win in life has led to a pattern of risk-taking that has put his ride-hailing company on the brink of implosion” and it backs that with solid evidence. Of course, approaching—but not yet disintegrating in—a full-on implosion seems to be one of Kalanick’s defining talents…so far. Bannon, The Businessman Steve Bannon. You need only utter the name of the senior counselor to the president to generate an intense reaction in many quarters. The New Yorker decided to mostly sidestep politics and profile Trump's advisor, focusing especially on Bannon's earlier incarnation as a businessman—an investment banker and producer—particularly during his years on the West Coast. “How Hollywood Remembers Steve Bannon,” by business-profile master Connie Bruck, is utterly fascinating. The article describes how Goldman Sachs brought Bannon out to Los Angeles (he eventually formed his own firm) and raises questions about the already-widely-accepted view that Bannon made millions on the TV show Seinfeld. It also casts doubt as to whether, as others have reported, Bannon brought the prominent Saudi prince Alwaleed in as a bidder for PolyGram in the late 1990s. Nothing is accepted at face value under Bruck’s exacting reporting. One of the most bizarre episodes is Bannon’s role (with one of the Bass brothers of Texas, who are the Kevin Bacons of finance—seemingly connected to so many important people in the investing world) as an investor and later CEO of Biosphere 2. The latter was a prominent project in the 1990s, a glass-domed earth-like habitat that, among other things, was intended to facilitate research on the effects of greenhouse gases on the climate. One passage describes what happened when Ed Bass and Bannon, a former naval officer, decided a management change was needed. They “planned the takeover as meticulously as a paramilitary operation,” Bruck writes. “On April 1, 1994, he and Bowen rode toward Biosphere 2, accompanied by armed U.S. marshals and a phalanx of support people. The marshals went first, followed by investment bankers, accountants, public-relations people, and secretaries. Bannon had placed his younger brother Chris, a former Navy pilot, at the head of the first team. Chris Bannon told Reider, ‘We had to secure the gate out front, get out with the federal marshals, serve the security person at the gate, secure the gate, and then move into the other critical areas that had already been defined in order to insure the safety and security of the Biosphere and its systems.’” Believe it or not, things only get more contentious from there. Two Worlds, 40 Miles Apart For a powerful juxtaposition of the lives of rich and poor when it comes to housing, read "What It’s Like to be a Real-Estate Agent to DC’s Super Rich," in Washingtonian, and then  "Dismissed: Tenants Lose, Landlords Win In Baltimore's Rent Court," in the Baltimore Sun. The former is a profile of Nancy Taylor Bubes, the "grand dame" of Washington residential real estate—"a more Hermès version of Kathie Lee Gifford"—who sold $174 million worth of homes last year. The article is an appealing portrait of a top high-end salesperson and it's filled with fun lines: "Watching Bubes in action is like watching one of those Hindu deities with all the arms." The details are amusing, too, including the time she agreed to sell a $2.9 million house with the terms scribbled on a napkin at a cocktail party, then called the next day to tell the buyer, "You are going to honor your cocktail napkin. A deal’s a deal." Of course, you may not feel the same way about the anecdote after reading "Dismissed," which is filled with wrenching accounts of poor people and how they are at a disadvantage against landlords in Baltimore's housing court, even when the landlords are failing to provide livable properties or to, say, remediate the lead paint threatening the lives of the tenants' families. Some people have pointed out that the article is reminiscent of the superb 2016 book "Evicted," which won the Pulitzer Price recently for its depiction of the housing plight of poor people in Milwaukee, and it's true. The Sun article is filled with  examples of inequity, including what occurs in the highly rare instances in which tenants are able to persuade a judge that the landlord has failed his or her obligations: "In the 54 cases in which inspectors found homes to be 'illegal' or 'unfit' for habitation, landlords won 89 percent of the money." Combined, the two pieces starkly illustrate the income inequality that plagues this country. Spinal Tap: The Lawsuit It’s no revelation that Hollywood’s accounting tends to be roughly as accurate as Enron’s. But “This Lawsuit Goes To 11,” in BloombergBusinessWeek, offers an entertaining and illuminating voyage into the miasma of movie bookkeeping. It chronicles efforts by the creators of “This Is Spinal Tap,” the beloved original ‘mockumentary’ of the ill-fated heavy-metal band of the same name, to try to claim a financial return on the movie more than three decades after it premiered and eventually became a beloved cult hit. Wearing the black hat and twirling its mustache is the giant conglomerate Vivendi, which informs actor Harry Shearer (AKA bassist Derek Smalls, most infamous for a foil-wrapped cucumber) that “Shearer and his three creative partners’ share of total worldwide merchandising income from 1984 to 2006 was $81, and the total income from soundtrack sales from 1989 to 2006 was $98. That’s just dollars, with no zeros at the end. It was Stonehenge all over again: They’d expected feet and got inches.” The article acknowledges this is a hoary form of injustice: … this is Hollywood, where studios have claimed that some of the highest-grossing films—hits such as Return of the Jedi, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and the Lord of the Rings trilogy—somehow haven’t turned a profit. As David Zucker, one of the creators of Airplane!, once said of his own sleeper hit, “It made so much money that the studio couldn’t hide it fast enough.” Usually, I find it hard to muster much sympathy for Hollywood stars claiming studios haven’t rewarded them as richly as they should. But when it comes to the weathered super-annuated lads in this particular faux-metal band, it’s a different matter. In fact, there’s a Spinal Tap song title that I think would properly capture their attitude—and mine, after reading this article—to the movie industry. We can’t print the title in a G-rated newsletter. We'll just quote the fictional Nigel Tufnel, who says the song is “influenced by Mozart and Bach—it’s sort of in between those—it’s like a ‘Mach’ piece…” Nicholas Varchaver @nickvarchaver nicholas_varchaver@fortune.com Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers © 2017 Time Inc.

Image INQUIRER.net stock photo Apple fans may have to wait until much later this year to get their iPhone 8 fix. A reputable Apple analyst, KGI Ming-Chi Kuo, has indicated that mass production of the iPhone 8 may be delayed by one to two months from Apple’s usual release dates, reports 9to5Mac. KGI claims that the possible causes for delay involve production of some cutting-edge major components. These include the custom OLED display, a custom Aple A11 10-nanometer SoC (system on chip), a newly-designed 3D touch module, and 3D sensing cameras. ADVERTISEMENT The delay would also leave Apple vulnerable to competition from its rivals, as more bezel-less Android devices make it to the market.  Furthermore, despite the rumors, Apple has yet to officially hint at what the iPhone 8 will actually look like. Given the trend, it’s fairly safe to assume that it will also be a bezel-less device. It would at the very least put Apple on equal footing with Samsung, Huawei and Xiaomi in that area. KGI has indicated a pessimistic outlook on the sales of iPhone 7 models—interim updates at best that KGI believes will pale in comparison to more recently released smartphones. Until more information gets released directly from Apple, there isn’t much else to do but wait and speculate. Who knows, the iPhone 8 might end up being worth the wait. Alfred Bayle/JB RELATED STORIES: Refurbished Samsung Galaxy Note 7 goes on sale this June Smartphone case helps parents regulate children’s phone usage Customers seeing red on Galaxy S8, Samsung promises software fix ADVERTISEMENT Subscribe to INQUIRER PLUS to get access to The Philippine Daily Inquirer & other 70+ titles, share up to 5 gadgets, listen to the news, download as early as 4am & share articles on social media.

(Source: Reuters) The global smartphone market has registered a growth of 4.3 per cent in Q1 2017, according to research firm IDC. Smartphone vendors shipped a total of 347.4 million units worldwide last quarter, up 4.3 per cent from the 332.2 million units in Q1 2016. Despite the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, Samsung once again shipped more smartphone units than any other player. The company regained the top slot from Apple during the first quarter with shipments of 79.2 million smartphones. Samsung’s position was bolstered by deep discounts on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, which actually helped clear out of inventory and make room for the Galaxy S8 and S8+. The J-series and A-series also drove significant volumes in both emerging and developed markets, the research firm said. Apple, which took the second spot, remained largely flat during the quarter despite the introduction of its new Red iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and refreshed iPhone SE. The Cupertino-based company slipped 0.5 per cent (to 14.9 per cent) as shipments were up by 400,000 to 51.6 million. Apple will officially reveal its iPhone sales for the quarter on May 2. Samsung, Apple and Huawei have retained their top positions with 22.8 per cent, 14.9 per cent and 9.8 per cent shares of the global smartphone market respectively, while Oppo and Vivo rounded out the top five, respectively. “Despite all the popularity and media hype around premium devices, we continue to witness a shift in many companies’ portfolios geared towards affordable devices with premium-type styling compared to flagship models,  said Anthony Scarsella, research manager with IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker. “Companies have started to implement a single premium design language that ultimately blurs the lines between the high-end and the low-end, allowing the average consumer to jump on the brand without a hefty upfront investment,” he added. What is interesting in IDC’s report is that it sees the Chinese OEMs like Huawei, OPPO, and vivo, are the main players boosting smartphone growth. The research firm notes that these companies have “outpaced market growth for over a year now,” which is significant. These players are continuing to grow in double digits, which the overall smartphone market has now slowed down to single digit growth. Oppo shipped 25.6 million smartphone units in this quarter, and saw a yearly growth of 29.8 per cent, while vivo shipped 18.1 smartphones. IDC’s report also notes that both brands have boosted their presence in India, which is one of the most important smartphone markets in the world.

Digital Trends Home > Web > Merriam-Webster lists ‘sheeple’ as a… Merriam-Webster lists ‘sheeple’ as a word, cites Apple fanatics as examples By Lulu Chang — April 29, 2017 7:13 AM Share Le Pich/Instagram Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Merriam-Webster, which has its finger on the pulse of our language, says Apple fanatics are "sheeple." Merriam-Webster understands that its dictionary is a living document, subject to the verbal fashions and colloquialisms of succeeding generations. And as a sign of the times, the respected language source has added the word “sheeple” (a word that our word processor still doesn’t recognize) to the official list of Webster-ordained words. What are sheeple, you ask? Well, as Merriam-Webster would have you believe, they’re Apple fanatics. See? Like we said — a sign of the times. Let us explain further. In a recent tweet, the dictionary announced the addition of “sheeple” to its word bank, an informal word defined as “people who are docile, compliant, or easily influenced” and thereby “likened to sheep.” Now, as dictionaries are wont to do, Merriam-Webster provided some context for the word, placing it in a sentence. The first one is innocuous enough, reading, “James Nichols, who ran the family farm here, stamped dollar bills with red ink in protest against currency and told his neighbors that they were “sheeple” for obeying authority like livestock.” But then, Merriam-Webster takes its gloves off and sharpens its claws (or at least, selects a user-submitted sentence that is quite vicious). “Apple’s debuted a battery case for the juice-sucking iPhone — an ungainly lumpy case the sheeple will happily shell out $99 for,” a portion of the definition reads. And if you’re interested, this example was submitted by one Doug Criss. According to Merriam-Webster, which has been cataloging the English language since 1843,  the first use of the word “sheeple” took place in 1945. That was a solid decade before Steve Jobs was even born, and certainly well before any Apple products came about (and elicited great fandom from sheeple everywhere). So beware, Apple fanatics. You may find yourself the butt of a dictionary joke, but hey, you’ve got your fancy tech products to make you feel better.

Panoramics Photos Rec.humor.funny Joke Site Robocar Bog Twitter Best of Blog Brad's Home Robocars.com Home » Topic » Robocars No, Detroit is not winning the robocar race. Submitted by brad on Mon, 2017-04-03 17:30. Robocars A new report from Navigant Research includes the chart shown below, ranking various teams on the race to robocar deployment. It’s causing lots of press headlines about how Ford is the top company and companies like Google and Uber are far behind. I elected not to buy the $3800 report, but based on the summary I believe their conclusions are ill founded to say the least. This ordering smacks of old-world car industry thinking. Saying that Ford and GM are ahead of Waymo/Google is like saying that Foxconn is ahead of Google or Apple in the smartphone market. Foxconn makes the iPhone of course, and makes lots of money at a modest profit margin of a few percent. Apple and Google don’t make their phones, they design them and the software platform. Ford and GM might feel good reading this report, but they should not. I do actually like Ford’s plan quite a bit — especially their declaration that they will not sell their robocar to end-users. I also like Daimler’s declaration that they want to have a taxi style service called “Car2Come” after their Car2Go one-way on-demand car rental service. (Americans giggle at the name, Germans are never bothered by such things. :-) GM does not belong high on the list, other than for its partnership with Lyft. They were wise to acquire a company like Cruise — and I know the folks at Cruise, this is not a criticism of them — but it’s not enough to catapult you to the front of the list. A similar article came out a few months ago, declaring that Silicon Valley was sure to lose to Detroit, because Detroit knows how to make cars, and Silicon Valley doesn’t. The report went further and declared that Google was falling behind because they had said they did not plan to make a car. The author had mistakenly thought Google had plans to make a car — Google never said anything like that — and so decided that the announcement that they would not make one was a big retreat on their part. Companies like Google, Apple and Uber have never stated they wished to make cars, or felt they were any good at it. If they want to make cars, they have the cash to go buy a car company, but there is no need to do that. There are a couple of dozen companies around the world who are already very good at making cars, and if you come to them with an order for 100,000 cars to your specification, they will jump to say “yes, sir!” Some of the companies, the big leaders like Toyota or BMW, might well refuse that order, not wanting to be the supplier for a threat to their existence. But it won’t help them. Somebody will be that supplier. If not a German, Japanese or U.S. company, then a Korean company, or failing that a Chinese company. In fact, Foxconn has said it is interested in making cars, and Apple is designing them, so the Apple-Foxconn relationship may be far more than a metaphor for this situation. When you summon an Uber, you don’t care what nameplate is on the car. When you summon UberSelect, you don’t care if it’s Lexus, or Mercedes or BMW. Uber was your brand, and you aren’t buying the car for 15 years, you are buying it for 15 minutes. Brand plays a completely different role. Companies like Waymo, Apple, Uber, Zoox and others would be foolish to manufacture cars, unless they want a car so radically different that nobody knows how to make it. (Then, they might decide to be the first to figure it out.) The car manufacturers would be foolish to turn down the giant purchase order, or partnerships with whoever has the best technology. The winner of the transportation game of the future will be the company that thinks outside the car. That doesn’t mean the big car companies can’t do that. It’s just harder for them to do. The chart’s not entirely wrong. Honda is pretty far behind — but PSA is even further behind. BMW, Daimler and Ford are among the best of the car companies, but Tesla and Volvo deserve higher ranking. Hyundai is not ahead of Toyota, and Tesla, while not ahead of Waymo, is in a pretty good place. Bosch is a surprising absentee from the list. FCA should be on it, just very low on the chart, along with the smaller Japanese vendors and many Chinese vendors. But be clear. Making the car is essential, but it’s also old and a commodity. The value will lie in those building the self-driving software systems and sensors, and those putting services together around the technologies. The big automaker’s advantages — nameplate and reputation, reliability, manufacturing skill and capacity, retail channel experience — these are all less valuable or commoditized. They have to act fast to move to new business models that will make it in the future. Of course, one plan is to own the important components I name above, and several companies like BMW, Daimler, Ford, Nissan and Volvo are trying to do that. But they’re behind Waymo by a fair distance. » brad's blog My bet is Tesla is leading the race Submitted by Alnair (not verified) on Tue, 2017-04-04 02:16. Because autonomous driving is based on machine learning algorithms (similar to algorithms that use Google for the search engine) and provided the most data you have, the better result you get from those algorithms, a company that delivers 100K cars/year (soon 300K) with all hardware for autonomous driving capable to work in shadow mode gathering data from all his costumers around the world will soon overpass all the competition by large. That company is Tesla. I no doubt Waymo will be the best autonomous car in Palo Alto roads, but world is much more diverse and to learn all possible scenarios you need hundreds of thousands cars, not just hundreds. » reply Often said Submitted by brad on Tue, 2017-04-04 09:05. But if you go around the industry and ask the question, “Which company is the clear leader in machine learning and neural network technologies?” The answer will almost universally be “Google.” So do you really imagine that Tesla would be so far ahead of Waymo on that? That Waymo, even though recently put into its own company, has not made use of that skill? Why would they not? » reply automated transport Submitted by jim (not verified) on Thu, 2017-04-06 11:08. If you rephrase the question as "Which company is likely to profit the most from automated transportation in the next ~15 years? I would respond : Amazon I would think that automating the package delivery business is a better defined and easier problem than automating taxies. And Amazon is well on its way automating the package delivery business. I would be surprised if they don't already have a plan in place to cut the labor cost of delivering a package by a factor of 10 in the next 10 years. » reply Online retail Submitted by brad on Fri, 2017-04-07 09:40. Will indeed profit nicely, but it’s small compared to personal transportation. Delivery services around the world are a few hundred billion dollars. Personal transport is 5 trillion. » reply OEMs are the wrong segment to examine Submitted by Alison Chaiken (not verified) on Sat, 2017-04-29 22:48. The popular press always ranks automakers since the public knows their names and will buy the reports. In automotive ecosystem, this is wrong thinking. The companies that are really developing the technology are not just the Sili Valley favorites, but also Tier 1's and Tier 2's like Continental, Bosch (as you astutely point out) and Nvidia. Both Tesla and Audi run Nvidia's Tegra, making me wonder how different their systems really are. comma.ai also ran with the Nvidia Jetson board. BMW has partnered with Intel and Mobileye. Perhaps if the autonomy gold rush falters, Conti, Bosch, Harman, Nvidia and Intel will profit most. » reply Nvidia as a base Submitted by brad on Sun, 2017-04-30 02:30. Nvidia GPUs are, from this viewpoint, general purpose massively multicore processors. It’s all in the software, so there does not have to be any similarity in how Tesla and Audi and comma.ai use them. Now they are all doing neural networks with them but that’s again a platform rather than an algorithm. Tier Ones are working on it, but OEMs are scared of not owning what may become the more important tech in the car. » reply Comment viewing options Flat list - collapsedFlat list - expandedThreaded list - collapsedThreaded list - expanded Date - newest firstDate - oldest first 10 comments per page30 comments per page50 comments per page70 comments per page90 comments per page150 comments per page200 comments per page250 comments per page300 comments per page Select your preferred way to display the comments and click "Save settings" to activate your changes.

Photograph: Kiichiro Sato/AP Technology sector Observer business agenda Apple’s addiction to iPhone shows no sign of waning Nick Fletcher The firm would like to decrease reliance on revenue from its smartphone, but it’s not happening yet Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Sunday 30 April 2017 02.00 EDT A vision of the near future: you’re in your driverless Apple vehicle, heading for the new-look Apple Store whose Genius Groves provide space for business meetings, while watching Apple’s exclusive Carpool Karaoke video series on your Apple TV. The present is a bit more prosaic. On Tuesday, Apple’s current dependency on the iPhone is likely to be reinforced when it reports second-quarter results, hence its desire to expand its services businesses. The company is expected to report only a slight year-on-year rise in revenues to about $52bn after a couple of weak quarters, not to mention the first annual decline in iPhone sales last year. And analysts believe Apple’s guidance for the third quarter could be cautious, with JP Morgan forecasting sales of $44.2bn for the three months to June. The problem is that consumers could be keeping their cash in their pockets until the next iPhone arrives (it’s expected in September). Although some reports suggest the new model could be on display at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June, there have also been suggestions the September launch may be delayed because of supposed problems with a new edge-to-edge screen. But despite chief executive Tim Cook being unhappy at some of Donald Trump’s actions, notably the recent travel ban, Apple is set to benefit from the president’s tax policies. Trump plans to give incentives to companies who repatriate their large overseas cash holdings, although no details were given at last week’s tax announcement. A £2.6bn loss? Here, have a £343,000 bonus Pearson has come a long way since it began selling off its crown jewels, including Madame Tussauds, investment bank Lazard and more recently the Financial Times and the Economist, with its stake in book publisher Penguin Random House the next on the block. Unfortunately it has been in the wrong direction, with the company’s concentration on educational publishing proving problematic, particularly in the key US market. It reported the biggest loss in its history last year – some £2.6bn. Still, that didn’t stop Pearson awarding chief executive John Fallon – who has presided over five profit warnings since taking over from Marjorie Scardino in 2013 – a 20% increase in his total pay to £1.5m. To the surprise of many, this included a bonus of £343,000. When the award was announced last month, Sarah Wilson, chief executive of investor advisory service Manifest, said: “Many shareholders are automatically voting against any increased awards and so this will just ratchet up tension.” Something for Pearson investors to consider as they make their way to the company’s annual meeting on Friday. Rolls promises to create more bread Another company which recently recorded the biggest loss in its corporate history, and which is also holding an annual meeting this week, is Rolls-Royce. The aero-engine maker agreed a £671m settlement in January relating to bribery and corruption charges and this, along with a £4.4bn writedown due to the plunge in sterling, helped push it into a £4.6bn loss for the year. Chief executive Warren East said the write-off was “just an accounting measure” and did not reflect the underlying health of the business. The company has a target of increasing free cash flow from the current £100m to £1bn by 2020, which some analysts are unconvinced will happen. Deutsche Bank said: “Although we believe much better cash generation lies ahead … achieving the magic £1bn targeted by management looks to be a stretch too far. The key challenge for management is materially improving the cash generation within large civil engines.” Investors will have the chance to quiz executives on this and other topics at Thursday’s meeting, which takes place at Pride Park, home of Derby County football club. They must hope that, unlike Derby this time around, Rolls will soon be considered a Premier League performer again.

The world’s largest publicly-traded technology company and one of the main suppliers of components to the iPhone, its most important product, have traded accusations of lying, making threats and trying to create an illegal monopoly. The fight involves billions of dollars of technology licensing revenue that, if permanently cut off or reduced, would damage Qualcomm’s main source of profit and help bolster Apple’s margins. Apple told Qualcomm it will stop paying licensing revenue to contract manufacturers of the iPhone, the mechanism by which it’s paid the chipmaker since the best-selling smartphone debuted in 2007, the San Diego, California-based company said in a statement. Qualcomm removed any assumption it will get those fees from its forecast for the current period. Apple doesn’t have a direct license with Qualcomm, unlike other phone makers. “We’ve been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years but they have refused to negotiate fair terms,” Apple said in a statement. “Without an agreed-upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court. As we’ve said before, Qualcomm’s demands are unreasonable and they have been charging higher rates based on our innovation, not their own.” Qualcomm said revenue in its fiscal third quarter ending June will be $4.8 billion to $5.6 billion, down from last week’s prediction of $5.3 billion to $6.1 billion. It’s also short of the $5.78 billion average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings per share will range between 52 cents and 62 cents, compared with the earlier forecast of 67 cents to 92 cents. Minus certain items, profit per share will be 75 cents to 85 cents. For Qualcomm, Apple’s move is a further infringement on its legal agreements with the contract makers of the iPhone, who also make devices for other companies. Those agreements predate Apple’s entry into the phone market and are still legally enforceable. “While Apple has acknowledged that payment is owed for the use of Qualcomm’s valuable intellectual property, it nevertheless continues to interfere with our contracts,” said Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel. “Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade.” He said Apple’s interference with Qualcomm’s agreements to other parties is wrongful and part of the Cupertino, California-based company’s global attack on Qualcomm. Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said Qualcomm’s largest customer has declared “all-out war,” leaving a dark cloud over earnings and its stock price. “Even if one believed this was a worst case scenario, we struggle to see a resolution anytime soon as the parties entrench,” Rasgon wrote in a note to investors Friday. Qualcomm managed expectations around the dispute poorly, he added. Shares fell as much as 4.1 percent to $51.05 Friday morning. It was the lowest intraday price since June. They were trading at $52.91 at 12:16 p.m. in New York. Apple stock edged 0.2 percent higher to $144.12, close to a record. Qualcomm’s lucrative licensing division funds an industry-leading research-and-development budget, which has helped its chips stay ahead of rivals. That strategy, which has helped the company more than double revenue since 2010, is under threat as the dispute with Apple worsens and it deals with regulatory investigations in the U.S., South Korea, Taiwan and Europe. It says Apple instigated those investigations by making false claims to government agencies. Apple’s end goal is to lower the fees, Qualcomm said. When it began it’s suit against Qualcomm in January, Apple accused Qualcomm of monopolizing the market for chips used in wireless devices and withholding $1 billion in retaliation for cooperating with South Korean antitrust authorities. Apple also said it wants back some of the billions of dollars it claims it was overcharged in “Qualcomm’s illegal scheme” to control the market for mobile phone chips. It wants a court to change how Qualcomm charges for its technology. Patents controlled by Qualcomm cover the basics of all high-speed data capable mobile phone systems. It charges a percentage of the total selling price of the phone regardless of whether the device uses a Qualcomm chip or not. Qualcomm had given a wider-than-normal forecast range for the current quarter, reflecting the possibility that Apple may pressure its suppliers, company President Derek Aberle said last week. “We’d expect that they will pay, consistent with their obligations,” he said at the time. “We can’t completely discount the possibility that Apple will continue to interfere and cause them to pay less than they owe.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share via Email In this article: Apple IncQualcomm Inc.

According to the latest report published by IDC, the combined smartphone shipments by the three Chinese firms increased by 15.5 million units on-year to 77.9 million units in the first quarter. During the same period, Samsung and Apple remained essentially flat with shipments reaching 79.2 million units and 51.6 million units, respectively. The combined market share of the three Chinese firms increased by 3.7 percentage points on-year to 22.4 percent in the January-March period, while Samsung and Apple’s share dropped by 1 percentage point and 0.5 percent point to 22.8 percent and 14.9 percent, respectively. IDC said the clear winners in the global smartphone market were currently Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo, which have all outpaced market growth for over a year. The Oppo booth at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain Shin Ji-hye/The Korea Herald “Although we have seen an abundance of premium redesigned flagships that just entered the market, we still expect most of the growth to come from more affordable models in a variety of markets” said Anthony Scarsella, research manager with IDC’s worldwide quarterly mobile phone tracker. The prices of Chinese handsets’ premium phones are around half those of Samsung and Apple. Huawei’s first premium phone P9, unveiled late last year, is sold for around 600,000 won ($520) and Oppo’s flagship model R9 is around 500,000 won. Samsung and Apple’s premium phones are sold for around 1 million won. The report said the world’s largest smartphone maker Samsung’s strong sales were also driven by affordable models. “Samsung’s affordable models J-series and A-series drove significant volumes in both emerging and developed markets due to flagship-like design at more affordable price points,” IDC said. Also, substantial discounts on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge helped boost this year’s flagship models -- the new S8 and S8 Plus, the company said. IDC predicted the global smartphone industry would see a rebound this year after suffering a single digit growth of 2.5 percent last year. Prior to the disappointing 2016, the global smartphone market enjoyed double-digit growth for 9 years from 2007 to 2015. Worldwide smartphone shipments grew 4.3 percent in the first quarter on-year, which was slightly higher than IDC’s previous forecast of 3.6 percent growth. “There is no question that 2016 was a pivotal year for the industry, as growth dipped to low single digits for the first time. However, we believe the industry will show some rebound in 2017, and strong first quarter results certainly support this argument,” said Ryan Reith, program vice president with IDC’s worldwide quarterly mobile device trackers. The report said big flagship announcements from Huawei with the P10 devices and Samsung with the Galaxy S8 devices show that innovation is still possible. Despite any formal announcements from Apple, it is safe to say the industry is highly anticipating this year’s iPhone announcements, the report said.  By Shin Ji-hye (shinjh@heraldcorp.com) 영어뉴스를 통한 ListeningㆍReading 실력 향상 단기 학습 프로그램 [NEST] 1.

Amazon and Google could get some tough competition from Apple in the smart speaker segment. Apple is reportedly developing a smart speaker, similar to that of Amazon Echo and Google Home. The leak comes from prolific tipster Sonny Dickson. “Apple is currently finalizing designs for their Apple competitor, expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device”, Dickson said on Twitter. Apple is currently finalising designs for their Alexa competitor, expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device. — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 27, 2017 He later added: “It is believed to carry some form of Beats technology, and is expected to run an variant iOS”. Dickson told Mashable’s Jen Ryall that the smart speaker will sport a design that’s inspired by the Mac Pro, and the UE Boom’s mesh styling.  Dickson did not mention anything about a release date for the device, or a price. He believes that Apple could launch the device at this year’s WWDC.

However, the surprising part is that speaker speaker will include “Beats technology”. It’s being said that Apple might add Beat’s audio tech into its own smart speaker system. This is not the first time we’re hearing that Apple is developing a smart speaker. Back in May 2016, The Information reported that Apple could launch an “Amazon Eco-like device with a speaker and microphone built-in”. At that time, it was suggested that the device could be launched at the company’s annual WWDC. Two months later, CNET reported that Apple’s Siri-powered speaker would be able to detect the people who are in close proximity to the device using “on-board” cameras equipped with some sort of facial recognition software. In February 2017, however,  Times’s Tim Bajarin said that Apple was no longer interested in developing an intelligent speaker. Instead, Apple is “more interested in turning Siri into an omnipresent AI assistant across devices, rather than designing a single device specifically to serve as a Siri machine”. Amazon’s Echo is perhaps the most popular voice-based smart speaker on the market today. Earlier in the week, the company revealed its latest Echo device, the Echo Look that comes with a built-in camera for taking photos and recording videos. The Echo Look is pitched as a fashion tool. Amazon’s Echo devices are powered by the company’s Alexa assistant. For all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd Tags: Apple No Comments.

By Rene Ritchie Saturday, Apr 29, 2017 at 9:00 am EDT 45 Comments Should you get the aluminum, stainless steel, or ceramic Apple Watch? Here's how to pick! Apple Watch Series 2 comes in your choice of three different materials with distinct properties and price points all their own. There's anodized aluminum — the same material Apple uses for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. There's stainless steel, which is heavier but stronger and a favorite of many watch-wearers. And there's ceramic, which replaces last year's 18K gold on the high end with something even more scratch-proof — and expensive — than steel. So, which should you choose? Price points Heavy materials Scratch and damage resistance Color matches Who should get the aluminum Apple Watch? Who should get the stainless steel Apple Watch? Who should get the ceramic Apple Watch? Price points The different Apple Watch materials all come with different price points, from entry-level to high-end. Aluminum starts at $369. Stainless steel starts at $599. Ceramic starts at $1249. So, if price is your most important consideration, aluminum is priced the lowest. Heavy materials Aluminum weights: 38mm: 28.8g 42mm: 34.2g Stainless steel weights: 38mm: 41.5g 42mm: 52.4g Ceramic weights: 38mm (rose gold): 39.2g 42mm (rose gold): 45.6g So, if you want the lightest Apple Watch possible, you want the aluminum Apple Watch. Scratch and damage resistance Unfortunately, with great lightness does not come great hardness. Here's how the different materials hold up to damage. The aluminum Apple Watch is the "softest" and the anodization could scratch or chip. The stainless steel Apple Watch is much, much harder, especially the black model with diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating. The ceramic Apple Watch is even harder than steel but is potentially easier to shatter if dropped onto a hard surface. So, if resistance to damage is the absolute most important thing to you, the stainless steel watch in general, and the space black version in particular, offer the best combination of scratch and shatter resistance. Color matches Apple Watch comes in a variety of colors, depending on the material. Silver aluminum Space gray aluminum Gold aluminum Rose gold aluminum Polished stainless steel Space black stainless steel White ceramic When you buy additional bands, though, the lugs won't always match the case. Sport bands have colored lugs. Woven nylon have colored lugs. Leather buckles and loops have polished stainless steel lugs. Stainless steel link bracelet and Milanese loop have polished stainless steel lugs. Space gray steel link bracelet and Milanese loop have space black lugs. So, if matching the lugs to the case is important to you, stainless steel offers the widest possible compatibility. Who should get the aluminum Apple Watch? If you're into physical fitness and you want the lightest Apple Watch you can get; if you're going to be rough enough with it — or likely to lose it — and want the most affordable replacement option possible; if you're not sure about Apple Watch and want to try it out at the lowest cost-of-entry; or if you simply love the way the bead-blasted aluminum and those gold and rose gold options look, you should get the aluminum Apple Watch. See at Apple Who should get the stainless steel Apple Watch? If you love watches and want something heavy but not too heavy; classic on the outside but ultra-modern within; made out of strong materials like stainless steel and sapphire crystal; and with the widest range matching bands possible; or if you want a watch but aren't precious about your metals, the stainless steel is for you. See at Apple Who should get the ceramic Apple Watch? If money is no object; if you're into ceramic watches in general, if you want the most scratch-resistant surface possible, if iPod-white is your jam, or if you simply want something that stands out in a crowd, you want the ceramic Apple Watch.

Much harder. The problem is that the aluminum underneath is soft, so the hard surface can be scratched through, if enough pressure is used. I don't know if the Watch is decoratively anodized, or hard anodized. The difference is the thickness. Hard anodization is up to ten times as thick as decorative anodization. It's used on machine surfaces and parts. Anodized aluminum doesn't chip. It's not paint. It can gauge out, if enough force at the right (or wrong) angle is used. It may look like a chip, but it's not. You can tell with a magnifier. The black SS is coated with a microscopic layer of carbon. It's laid on by a gaseous diffusion method. It's effectively black diamond, and is the hardest surface of all the watches, including the ceramic. I've had mine since the first day the Series 2 came out, and there's not one scratch. The regular SS will get fine scratches, but the same is true of all SS watches, and isn't something to bother about. It adds character. The ceramic body is also very hard, though not as much as the diamond SS model. But it's very resistant to scratching as well. While it might break if dropped on a concrete floor, it's very unlikely. All ceramics used for watches are very strong. It could get a tiny chip though. 0 1 day ago Reply jakeair I have the space gray aluminum 38 mm. An anodized aluminum surface is actually harder than stainless steel. Compare an aluminum watch with a stainless steel watch and you'll see the stainless steel watch has many visible scratches; my aluminum watch does not. So for superficial scratch resistance, the anodized aluminum is better. If you tend to drop the watch from 6 feet onto concrete then the stainless steel would be a better choice. 0 1 day ago Reply skellener When Apple revs the watch and creates a big round face, large beefy bezel and is readable in bright sunlight (like my Garmin Fenix 3), I'll have a look at it. Until then, I'll pass. 0 1 day ago Reply melgross Good for you. 0 1 day ago Reply mrkeynes I have the space gray aluminum Apple Watch series 2. I'm happy with it, plus I believe the dark gray/black goes with anything 0 1 day ago Reply andsoitgoes As someone who is trying to exercise more and improve my health, the tie ins with apps like Up and Strata are sure appealing and would certainly be fantastic to have. But while I'm used to dropping $1k on a phone or slightly less on an iPad, I'm finding it really hard to justify extending out over $500 (yay Canada's weaker dollar) to purchase a product with the kind of battery life seen here. But thankfully, as with most Apple products, things improve as the years progress and by the time the 3rd generation releases, the prior generation will be available with better specs and a much lower price point. I just need to convince my clearly weak willpower that I can make do as is. But damn it's a nice watch. 0 2 years ago Reply pbalrog I think it'll be interesting to see what people buy when the "s" comes out in a year. Despite what people say last year's apple watch isn't going to have any real resale value, so do you buy a $1000 watch and make it last two years or two cheap ones? I'm betting the sports model will do better in the second gen. I'll also bet that a lot of nice bands will end up recycled onto cheap watches when it's time to upgrade. Unless of course Apple sell the next version in a band free config. 0 2 years ago Reply jayzero76 The waterproof one! 0 2 years ago Reply bsincick I will go for the Black case with link bracelet. Might even opt for a sport as well. I would like to try the Edition to get a feel of weight. 0 2 years ago Reply decypher44 None of the above. Sent from the iMore App -1 2 years ago Reply Sitar_noise I like the look of the space grey aluminum but don't think it'll look good with anything other than the black band it comes with. Aftermarket bands may take care of this but I think the silver aluminum goes better with different bands from apple. I really want to see in person what the silver aluminum looks like with the milanese loop though. 0 2 years ago Reply Matt Bauman1 Space gray sport would also look good with the blank link bracelet. Sent from the iMore App 0 2 years ago Reply Chaka Jon I also think it would look good with the black leather loop band. The only band available, besides the black link, that has no contrasting hardware. 0 2 years ago Reply winstonsmith39 I would go for the stainless steel with Milanese loop band. I have a Pebble, but I don't wear it because the band gives me a rash, so the Sport bands are probably not an option. I'd have to buy an iPhone first though, and as I don't own or need a mobile phone at present, this is unlikely. So, no Apple Watch for me. 0 2 years ago Reply cisneroscad Has anyone noticed that the Sport comes with 2 bands while the Watch only comes with one? 0 2 years ago Reply Galley It comes with two different length bands, to fit a wider range of wrist sizes. Some of the other bands are sold in different lengths. 0 2 years ago Reply cisneroscad I guess I needed to specify to only compare the models with Sport Band. Apple Watch Sport comes with 2 Sport Band (S/M & M/L) and Apple Watch with Sport Band comes with only 1 (not specified which one) I Just find it curious that you pay more for the watch and get 1 band less, if your wrist is between 150-180 mm for 38mm watch or 160-185mm for the 42mm watch you'd have 2 bands for the life of your watch or you could re-sell one of them to anyone who didn't get the Sport Band. Although the Sizing Guide specifies that the Sport Band come with both bands, I guess we will have to wait until release day to be certain if it comes with 1 or 2. 0 2 years ago Reply Gazoobee The way I see it out of all the watches they offer, there are only two basic models. The Apple Watch (steel) is the watch the way Apple wanted to design it, with the materials that are best for the design. The Sport watch only exists because they needed a "cheap" variant below $500. It's the same Apple Watch, but with all the expensive stuff swapped out for cheap replacements that are only about half as good. The Editions are irrelevant nonsense, but their design is identical to the basic Apple Watch. The only difference is the precious metals, which have all been treated to "behave like steel". The Sport Watch is the only real different one. It's the only one where they made compromises and swapped out all the good materials for lesser ones to lower the price. It's the only one that will perform differently. The one that will scratch and break more easily. The one that might not last as long. 1 2 years ago Reply rey4Christ I'm thinking I'll get the sport with black or white band. Then one day get another band. I don't want to spend to much first in I know once the next one comes out I'm going to want to get it, also I want to know if I would get good use out of the watch. 0 2 years ago Reply cardfan Who should get the Apple Edition? No one. Only consider this if you want to be laughed at. Who should get the Sport? Glass, cheap aluminum, and a cheap rubber band. The watch's equivalent of 16gb or too little RAM. No doubt it'll be the best seller of the bunch. Who should get the Steel? The ones made to look halfway normal due to bands offered. These are what Apple want you to get. They also won't scratch on contact like the cheaper glass and aluminum. 1 2 years ago Reply ultravisitor No one should get the Edition. -4 2 years ago Reply TechShizzle Quit trying to spend (or not spend) OTHER PEOPLE'S money.

I won't truly be able to decide until I can try some of these on. I actually really like the way the silver sports watch looks. But I don't like the bands options. I'll probably get the steel with the black band and see if I can pick up the tan leather sports strap. Hopefully third party bands will come before summer. It would be nice if Apple released some different bands as well. My favorite types of bands are fabric, or nylon bands. -1 2 years ago Reply JasonPrunty No. /end article -4 2 years ago Reply Sax_Derp Hi Rene, you have a typo in the "Strap In" section where you're referring to the gold pin with the Edition Strap.

I have been wearing a steel seiko kinetic for past year. And it is slightly bulkier that an  watch and heavier(?) so, okay in that regard. But if the sport looks good with the Milanese, I may be swayed 2 2 years ago Reply cclauson I don't think it will look terrible, but bear in mind the stainless Milanese is finished to match the steel case, so there will be a slight variation on finishes with the Sport. -1 2 years ago Reply iPandorum Slate black apple watch sport... It's a 1st gen so don't want to splurge just yet. 3rd gen we will see Sent from the iMore App 4 2 years ago Reply Matt Bauman1 Agree. While I'd like the space gray steel, I don't want to pay that price for a first gen device. So I'll go space gray sport with black rubber band. Buy a third party link bracelet when available. 0 2 years ago Reply Galley I'm leaning toward the stainless steel watch because it does have better materials and may have better resale value. If the space black model was available with a black sport band for $599, I would jump on it. I will need to see the stainless steel models in person before I make a decision. I would probably be happy with a space gray aluminum model, though. 3 2 years ago Reply Audizine I really like the black stainless steal also. And wanted with the black link bracelet until I saw the price. So then I wanted with the black sports band. But that's not available. I really want the watch because of the sapphire glass and stainless steal. But looking at the photos. I just don't like the shiny stainless steal. Wish it was a brushed steal or something. I guess I'll have to wait and see it in person. But for now space gray aluminum it is. 1 2 years ago Reply Chaka Jon Hoping Apple has a sudden change of heart by the 10th, and offers the Black Steel with the sport band. That would be my first choice. 1 2 years ago Reply Audizine That would be awesome! 0 2 years ago Reply Chaka Jon Or at the very least, offer the Silver Aluminum Sport with a back band. As we get closer to the 10th, I guess I'll have to make my final choice: Space Gray Aluminum Sport or Stainless Steel with black sport band. I may end up pre-ordering both, then decide which one I want between the 10th-24th, after trying them both on at the Apple Store. 0 2 years ago Reply Matt Bauman1 Me too. Sent from the iMore App 1 2 years ago Reply cclauson Same. My baseline is that I beat the crap out of a 15 year old Rolex with stainless case and sapphire crystal. It shows fine scratches on the case, but the crystal is perfect. I can't tell you how many times I've banged it and expected to find a crack afterward. No issues. I'm sure all sapphire is not created equal, but I've not had luck with the Ion-X display on the 6 Plus. 1 2 years ago Reply Gazoobee Taste is personal, but for me ... I don't see why when given a choice between "nice shiny steel thing," and "nice shiny steel thing painted *black*," that anyone would pick the black one. Apple does the best anodising in the world and their "coatings" are excellent, but a coating is a coating. It's obvious that sooner or later it will get scuffed up and the real steel will be showing through the scratches after a while. This is simply how coatings work. 1 2 years ago Reply anon4777630 I'm in the same boat. I was hoping to get the black stainless steel with the sport band since they offer the normal stainless steel with one. With the black link bracelet as the only option they've priced me out of the market. 0 2 years ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Research firm IDC said overall smartphone shipments grew 4.3 per cent in the first quarter, slightly better than its prior forecast, to 347 million units. “The first quarter smartphone results further prove that the smartphone industry is not dead and that growth still exists,” said IDC analyst Ryan Reith. “There is no question that 2016 was a pivotal year for the industry as growth dipped to low single digits for the first time. However, we believe the industry will show some rebound in 2017, and the strong first quarter results certainly support this argument.” Reith said the 2017 market will feel the impact of the new Samsung Galaxy S8 flagship handset, and a widely expected announcement from Apple for its new iPhone later this year. According to the survey, Samsung led the market in the first quarter with a 22.8 per cent share to 14.9 per cent for Apple, with little growth for the top two vendors. But Huawei’s sales jumped 21.7 per cent to give it a 9.8 per cent share, and fellow Chinese makers Oppo and Vivo, the number four and five vendors, respectively, also boosted their sales. IDC said the bulk of smartphone growth is likely to come from low-cost handset makers. “Although we have seen an abundance of premium redesigned flagships that just entered the market, moving forward, we still expect most of the growth to come from more affordable models in a variety of markets,” said IDC’s Anthony Scarsella. “Despite all the popularity and media hype around premium devices, we continue to witness a shift in many companies’ portfolios geared towards affordable devices with premium-type styling compared to flagship models.” He added that makers “have started to implement a single premium design language that ultimately blurs the lines between the high-end and the low-end, allowing the average consumer to jump on the brand without a hefty upfront investment.” The report is based on preliminary quarterly estimates, with Apple due to report sales figures next week. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week What to expect from Microsoft’s May 2 event Taking steps to avoid phishing scams Here’s a first look at the Fitbit Alta HR (VIDEO) Cyberattacks involving extortion are on the up, says Verizon Deforestation from a tree’s perspective at the TED conference Watch the US$3m 'Dota 2' Kiev Major live from today Interpol-led operation finds nearly 9,000 infected servers in South-east Asia Hands on with the Samsung S8+ Is Spotify working on a mysterious connected device?

(AAP) Previous Next Show Grid Previous Next Hide Grid Image 1/ Video Audio Taiwanese electronics giant Foxconn, maker of Apple iPhones, says it's looking to expand in the US. Source: AAP 30 Apr 2017 - 8:08 PM  UPDATED YESTERDAY 8:08 PM Tweet Taiwanese electronics giant Foxconn, maker of Apple iPhones, has announced it's in talks with the United States government to boost investment there. The world's largest maker of electronic products for international brands, said in a statement that it was studying a major expansion in the US. Foxconn Technology Group thanked the White House's Office of American Innovation, created by President Donald Trump and directed by Jared Kushner, for its efforts to pave the way for the company's negotiations with the US government. This statement follows a two-day visit by Foxconn President Terry Gou to the White House. Gou told the media Hon Hai planned to make a "capital intensive investment" in the US market. "We are planning a series of investments in America. This project will include capital intensive investment and skilled labour and high technology," Gou said. Media in Taiwan say Gou, accompanied by a delegation including Foxconn vice-president Tai Jeng-wu visited the White House and met with Trump. Foxconn, in late January, said if its customers like Apple co-operate, it could make investments in the US worth more than $US7 billion ($A9.3 billion). The Taiwanese company has manufacturing facilities in China with more than one million employees.

The picture of the supposed iPhone 8 case was uploaded by KK Sneak Leaks and was spotted by 9to5Mac. Read: iPhone Wireless Charging: Apple Wants You To Charge Your Device Via Wi-Fi In The Future iPhone 8 News: Vertical Dual-Cameras The leaked photo of the clear iPhone 8 case suggests the smartphone will come with a dual-camera positioned vertically instead of horizontally, different from how it's currently placed on the iPhone 7. The case backs up a recent Bloomberg report that said Apple was reportedly testing versions of the iPhone 8 for better photos by positioning the dual-camera system vertically. This week, a schematic leak suggested the cameras on the 10th anniversary phone will be vertically aligned. Another rumor pointed to a vertical camera module would make the device ideal for augmented reality games. Here’s the leaked schematic of the iPhone 8 released this week: The leaked picture of the iPhone 8 case also shows a longer power button on the bottom of the device, compared to the current lightning port, which is smaller. iPhone 8 Embedded Touch ID Numerous reports have claimed Apple will release the iPhone 8 with the Touch ID embedded in the screen display. However, an analyst said this month that integrating the new Touch ID onto the display was the feature causing Apple the most trouble. Some reports have said Apple will embed the Touch ID on the back of the phone rather than the front of the display. However, Friday’s leaked iPhone case image suggests the Touch ID will be located on the front of the device.

However, some reports have suggested the iPhone 8 could be delayed because of some features. The 10th anniversary iPhone could come with a price tag exceeding $1,000. The three new models this year are expected to measure 4.7-inches, 5.5-inches and a 5.8-inch version. The 2017 iPhones are rumored to come with True Tone display, which is currently available on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. The 10th anniversary iPhone is rumored to come with an array of new features. The iPhone 8, which could also be called the iPhone X, iPhone Pro or iPhone Edition, is rumored to come with an OLED screen display, wireless charging, and a 3D-sensing camera which could allow for augmented reality and virtual reality capabilities. Other rumors suggest the iPhone 8 will feature a Smart Connector for wireless charging and AR and VR accessories.

(File Photo) Shares3 DNA Web Team | Mon, 1 May 2017-10:41am , Mumbai , DNA webdesk After inking a contract to manufacture the iPhone SE in India from June, Apple has set its eyes on selling its phones exclusively through its own online stores in India, according to a report by The Economic Times. This would be possible for the brand without a go-ahead from the government as the current regulations allow companies that locally manufacture products to set up exclusive online stores. Apple has a target of starting local manufacturing from June. It has roped in Wistron, a Tiawanese manufacturer to make its iPhones in Bengaluru. It will first start manufacturing the iPhone SE, which means it will start selling the SE on its online stores first and will then widen the online product portfolio as and when it adds more models its manufacturing capacity in India. Currently, iPhones are sold through the e-commerce platforms in India, like Flipkart, Amazon. They are also sold through offline electronic stores in India, like Croma, others. According to the report, Apple will also sell its accessories online on its exclusive stores. They will also offer other services like engraving, embossing to personalise the iPhones.

The S8+, the G6 and the Mi Mix all aspire for a future where the ideal smartphone would be a long continuous sheet of glass with an edge-to-edge display and no physical buttons. The future is now. Although the Galaxy S8+, the G6 and the Mi Mix have similar goals, their approach to reaching them is strikingly different. While the Galaxy S8+ takes pride in its drop-dead gorgeous looks, the G6 is all about practicality. The Mi Mix, on the other hand, is a concept phone that's for real.  Samsung Galaxy S8+: If looks could kill Calling the Galaxy S8+ gorgeous will be an understatement. The Galaxy S8+. from Samsung, could easily pass as a limited edition device, the kind that only a high-profile fashion company could conjure. And then charge you a bomb for it. Apple and HTC are often credited for making the proverbial smartphone look good. Henceforth, Samsung will be credited for making them look even better. Curvier. The Galaxy S8+ is a hybrid cross between the Galaxy S7 Edge and the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7. It's no surprise then, that it's carved out of glass -- Corning's new Gorilla Glass 5 -- and metal. Only in the case of the Galaxy S8+, the metallic centerpiece that joins the front and back is virtually non-existent. It's also polished in a way that it looks like the whole thing is a continuous sheet of glass. The Galaxy S8+, especially when it's powered down, is indeed a sight to behold. Also Read: Is iPhone SE the best phone to buy under Rs 20,000? The front, in the case of the Galaxy S8+, is clean and sans any physical buttons. Samsung has moved the fingerprint scanner from the front on to the back. The home button, is meanwhile, software-based. It is also pressure-sensitive and gives you haptic feedback when you press it, kind of how it is in the case of Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. But, while the iPhone has a dedicated area -- atop a chunky lower bezel -- to serve the purpose, Samsung's phone employs what you can call an invisible solution. Samsung has also incorporated software-based back and recent keys in its new flagship phone which are also editable. You can now place the back key where it was always meant to be. On the left, of course. On-screen navigation keys are of course no taboo for the world of Android. What is, in fact, a taboo for Android phones are bezels (or rather the lack of them). Those wide unattractive strips (of plastic, glass or metal) that occupy the top, bottom and sides of most smartphones. The Galaxy S8+ has almost no bezels. To be a little more precise, it is all screen and no bezels. To be a little more precise, the phone gives you over 80 per cent of screen-to-body ratio. In a compact form factor. The Galaxy S8+, because it has almost no bezels, occupies a much smaller footprint -- size as well as girth -- in comparison to most 6-inch phones. The Galaxy S8+, for your reference, has a 6.2-inch screen. The iPhone 7 Plus and the Google Pixel XL look like giants in comparison. Even intimidatingly so. Being all-glass, however, has its downsides. The Galaxy S8+ attracts fingerprints and smudge by the millisecond. It can also be super glossy for some. But, it surely isn't slippery. An all glass (and metal) phone that isn't slippery is hard to find. Because, it isn't slippery (enough) you can afford to play around with it without having to worry about accidentally dropping and breaking its glorious curved screen. Should you, however, shatter it, you must know Samsung isn't offering any accidental cover. What it is offering though is a choice of as many as nine different cover accessories that you can buy separately. But whatever you do, don't drop it. Ever. You're allowed to drop it in the shower though because the Galaxy S8+ is IP68-certified for dust and water resistance. LG G6: Form follows function The LG G6, if I was to describe it in two words, is more practical. The G6, just like the Galaxy S8+, is also carved out of glass and metal. Only it differs in implementation. While the back of the G6 is carved out of Corning's Gorilla Glass 5, the screen has a healthy dose of Gorilla Glass 3. The decision to employ different versions of Glass, although hard to understand, stems from the fact that both the versions respond to physical stress differently. Not just scratch-proof, Gorilla Glass 5 will make your phone virtually shatter-proof, according to Corning. Gorilla Glass 3, meanwhile, focuses largely on scratch-resistance, besides being a lot thinner in comparison to the next-generation Glass making it suitable for displays. That's just one opinion. Probably LG was looking to cut cost as well, you never know. In LG's defense, the G6 doesn't require a heftier dose of Gorilla Glass 5, because well, it doesn't. The G6 is built to last long with bending resistant materials and shock-dispersing design, according to LG. It has passed Military-grade MIL-STD 810G tests which include 26 different angle drop tests from chest height, it claims. It's quite reassuring, the G6. While the Galaxy S8+ takes great pride in its gorgeous curves, the G6 takes a flat minimalist approach. LG's phone is as flat as they come, and also it has sharp corners that are a little raised out so the phone could bear accidental drops and yet survive. While the Galaxy S8+ takes pride in its drop-dead gorgeous looks, the G6 is all about practicality. The Mi Mix, on the other hand, is a concept phone that's for real LG doesn't make slim phones. It doesn't make light-weight phones as well. The G6 is no different. I have been using the Galaxy S8 for a while now, and let's just say, next to Samsung's phone the G6 feels rather chunky, but, only marginally. It is as slim as Samsung's phone though. The flat surface and sharp edges ensure it sticks to your hand and stays put, but then, the Galaxy S8+ is an ergonomic marvel as well in spite of all those extra curves. It is super-glossy and a fingerprint magnet. But, so is the Galaxy S8+. Only it takes me a lot longer to wipe LG's phone. I really don't like that, but, that's a small price you pay for an all-glass and metal design. The USP of the G6, however, is its 'big screen that fits.' The phone comes with ridiculously slim bezels allowing the display to take up around 80 per cent of its front side. The Galaxy S8+ is however, a lot more curvier in comparison, and also it offers slightly more screen-to-body ratio than LG's phone. Not only does the LG G6 have an industrial design, it has a perfectly usable fingerprint scanner as well. It's not as weirdly positioned as it is in the case of the Samsung Galaxy S8+ but occupies a more central position on the rear just the way it is in case of the Google Pixel. The LG G6 is also IP68-certified for water and dust resistance. Xiaomi Mi Mix: Warping technology Designed and jointly developed by renowned designer Philippe Starck, the Mi Mix boasts of a full ceramic body and a screen-to-body ratio of over 80 per cent: an almost perfect edge-to-edge to be precise, according to Xiaomi. The phone does not have a forehead, just the bottom. It has a very simplistic yet a very smart and sophisticated design. A design that will be hard to overlook. A design that will stay with you for a long, long time. It is exceptionally well-built as well. Because Xiaomi has employed the same material (and craftsmanship) throughout -- rear and sides -- it looks like the Mix has been carved out of a single block of glass. Even the power button and volume rocker have the same touch and feel. So much so that not an in inch of Xiaomi's Mi Mix feels out of place. There are a couple of obvious downsides though. (a) the Mix is as glossy as they get and (b) it is also very prone to fingerprints and scratches. Xiaomi, however, ships a very premium leather case with the Mix that saves you a lot of trouble. You will have to let go of all that shine on the back, but believe me, you're better off this way because the Mix also doesn't look like it could take a beating. Also, once you power up that screen, no one's going to actually care about the ceramic back anyways. The Mix is mostly flat as a pancake and the display is curved around the corners at the top and the sides. The impression of the screen gradually wrapping around the corners is, for the lack of a better word, a sight to behold. Note that Xiaomi hasn't completely gotten rid of the bezels, as there's still some 2 mm of excess baggage that comes along, but, the Mi Mix is the closest you'll get to it for now. Because, it came before the LG G6 and the Samsung Galaxy S8+, Xiaomi could well be deemed the one that started it all. Also Read: Samsung sold 28 million more phones than Apple in Q1: IDC The Mi Mix uses an ultrasonic proximity sensor and a piezoelectric ceramic driver for the earpiece that work through the display. The technology behind the whole thing -- called Inner Beauty -- is the workmanship of Elliptic Labs. Inner Beauty allows the speaker to be completely invisible by using patented algorithms not only to remove the proximity sensor, but also to hide the speaker behind the phone's glass screen, according to Elliptic Labs. Besides eliminating the hardware sensor, the technology also eliminates common issues with proximity sensors, such as their unreliability in certain weather conditions or in response to various skin colors as well as dark hair, Elliptic Labs claims. Because the proximity sensor and the earpiece lie inside the glass, you can use either side of the Mix to make/receive phone calls, and the screen will automatically turn off on both occasions. You might just want to tone down that volume if you're looking for some privacy though. The selfie camera, in the case of the Mix, is tucked away at the bottom. When you're taking a selfie, you look down or simply flip the phone around. The ultrasonic proximity sensor understands that you flipped the phone, and changes the orientation of the front camera accordingly. And it does this, very fast.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About General Image Source: Niels Epting New iOS 11 details revealed in interview with Apple exec Yoni Heisler @edibleapple April 27th, 2017 at 12:01 PM Share Tweet With WWDC just about five weeks away, iOS 11 is still something of a mystery. This is particularly unusual given that upcoming iOS features often have a tendency to leak out in the weeks and months ahead of Apple’s annual developer conference. Helping illuminate what iOS 11 might have in store for us, a new Bloomberg profile on Apple Music executive Jimmy Iovine reveals that the next iteration of iOS will feature a completely revamped Music app with a more concerted focus on video. Hardly a surprise, Apple hasn’t exactly been shy about its plan to augment Apple Music with a collection of music-oriented programming. Don't Miss: There’s one more reason I could never ditch my iPhone 7 Plus for a Galaxy S8 “A music service needs to be more than a bunch of songs and a few playlists,” Iovine explained. “I’m trying to help Apple Music be an overall movement in popular culture, everything from unsigned bands to video. We have a lot of plans.” “We have the freedom,” Iovine continued, “because it’s Apple, to make one show, three shows, see what works, see what doesn’t work until it feels good.” The report further details Apple’s plan to expand its stable of shows beyond Carpool Karaoke and the Dr. Dre biopic Vital Signs. By the time 2017 comes to a close, the report relays that Apple Music will house upwards of 10 original series, including a documentary on Bad Boy Records founder Puff Daddy and another on Cash Money Records. Another potential vehicle in the works involves a sequel to R. Kelly’s Trapped in the Closet. Even more tantalizing, though, is what Apple may be planning outside the realm of music. Eventually he plans to go beyond music and has discussed possible ideas with his friend Brian Grazer, producer of Empire and Genius, and director J.J. Abrams. “Apple Music is nowhere near complete in my head,” he says. The service, with more than 20 million subscribers, is the second most popular after Spotify, with more than 50 million premium members. As for other iOS 11 features rumored to be on the horizon, we’ve seen reports that Siri will see a massive overhaul and will see tighter integration with any number of other iOS apps and services, including Messages and iCloud. Additionally, with reports that the iPhone 8 will include advanced 3D cameras, it’s also been rumored that iOS 11 will feature exciting new augmented reality features, a concept of which can be viewed below.

The Daily Texan does not guarantee their accuracy. Published on April 30, 2017 at 10:35 pm By Laura Doan Movies like “Back to The Future Part II” and TV shows such as “The Jetsons” have cemented a view of the future as a place with smart-watches, robot assistants and, of course, flying cars. The modern world abounds with the iconography of the future. We now have access to the sophistication of the Apple Watch and the convenience of vacuum Roombas, but the dream of flying cars has always seemed too distant.  No longer.  Uber announced last Tuesday it plans to bring flying cars — known as their “Uber Elevate Network” — to Dallas-Fort Worth by 2020. Uber’s futuristic fleet is advertised to have vertical takeoff and landing capabilities, and is being built to be as silent as possible to abide by noise pollution rules. Additionally, Uber insists that these air taxis will be economically convenient, marketing their “Uber Elevate Network” as “a cheap alternative to building new roads and expanding public transit.”  To some, the idea of ascending rush hour traffic for a convenient price (this so-called convenient price has yet to be advertised) excites. But this Uber Elevate Network is a horribly bad idea. If flying cars must indeed be our future, Uber, with its lack of adherence to rules, is the last company we want leading the way.  Aviation is a field that requires strict adherence to safety standards and regulations, and Uber has shown itself to be a company with little regard for rules. There is a pervasive propensity for overstepping bounds within this company, pushed by their CEO, Travis Kalanick, that should not be tolerated on our roads and much less in our skies.  A recent article released in The New York Times reveals that Kalanick has been dragging Uber employees with him as he criss-crosses over privacy lines and barrels through boundaries. Led by Kalanick, employees were directed to secretly identify and tag iPhones after the Uber app was deleted, flouting Apple’s privacy guidelines. And Uber violates not just the policies of companies, but the law itself. In another example of dangerous tactics, Uber used a program called Greyball, a method of digital concealment, to help drivers hide from law enforcement in places where Uber service was illegal.  DFW has been a place where aviation has flourished for years, with companies like American Airlines, Southwest and Bell Helicopters setting up headquarters there. It makes sense that DFW desires to maintain its status as an air transportation capital and to head the impressive and potentially lucrative field of flying cars. But they ought to pick a different partner. Flying is one of the safest forms of transport because of the wealth of rules enforced by the Federal Aviation Administration and the transponders which help planes communicate with each other to avoid collision. We are entering terribly treacherous territory if we put flight in the hands of a company that has flouted safety rules digitally hidden its vehicles to avoid detection.  If flying cars do indeed happen, we could see such gems as a “Fast and the Furious” movie that takes place entirely in the stratosphere and have the privilege of watching a stream of winged SUVs zoom overhead during rush hour. But, in our excitement for the future of flight, we should not let Uber’s criminal company practices go unchecked. Doan is a Plan II and English sophomore from Fort Worth.  View the discussion thread.

VINDU GOEL SAN FRANCISCO — The New York Times News Service Published Sunday, Apr. 30, 2017 5:48PM EDT Last updated Sunday, Apr. 30, 2017 6:33PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print A year ago, many investors had given up on Apple Inc., whose stock price had fallen more than 30 per cent from its 2015 peak. Apple’s once-unstoppable growth had come to a crashing halt: The number of iPhones sold was down 13 per cent, and the company posted its first revenue decline in 13 years. Today, Apple’s business remains sluggish, but that has not stopped investors, including the famously tech-averse Warren Buffett, from falling in love with it again. Shares of the tech giant – the most valuable company in the United States by market value – have repeatedly hit new highs this year. On Friday, they closed at $143.65 (U.S.), up nearly 60 per cent from last May’s trough. What’s driving the stock, skeptics and fans alike say, is hope – hope that the new iPhones due in September, on the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone’s introduction, will be dazzling enough to inspire existing iPhone users to upgrade and prompt others to switch from Android phones made by Samsung, Huawei and other manufacturers. “Everyone expects Apple to cure cancer with their next product launch,” said Kevin Landis, chief executive of Firsthand Funds, who has managed tech-focused mutual funds through many ups and downs. Investors will get more data about Apple’s performance, and perhaps some clues about its future, on Tuesday, when the company reports its results for the financial quarter that ended in March. Analysts expect the company to report a slight increase in iPhone sales and overall revenue. Apple declined to comment before its earnings report. Mr. Landis sold most of Firsthand’s Apple position near last year’s bottom, but he said he had no regrets despite the stock’s recent gains. He expects Apple to continue churning out incremental improvements rather than shake up the industry. The biggest change in last fall’s iPhone 7, he noted, was the elimination of the headphone jack. Apple is expected to make more exciting updates in its next high-end iPhone, including a high-resolution screen that covers the phone’s entire face. But the company has also suggested that much of its future growth will come from services such as Apple Music, Apple Pay and the cut that Apple takes from sales and subscriptions in the app store. Apple executives have also acknowledged some missteps. After watching iPad unit sales spiral downward for 12 quarters in a row, the company introduced a cheaper model in March to win over schools that were flocking to Chromebooks. Apple is also likely to update its Pro models for businesses this year. Apple also admitted that the striking cylindrical design of the Mac Pro, a personal computer that is important to its most demanding customers, turned out to be a mistake that limited its upgrade potential. A completely redesigned Mac Pro will be released next year, Apple executives said in early April during an unusual meeting with tech journalists to discuss the computer’s shortcomings. “We made something bold that we thought would be great for the majority of our Mac Pro users. And what we discovered was that it was great for some and not others,” Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice-president for marketing, said at the meeting. “We’re sorry for that, what happened with the Mac Pro, and we’re going to come out with something great to replace it.” Investors appear to be relieved that Apple sales have stabilized after last year’s drop, said Neil Cybart, an independent analyst who writes about Apple at the website Above Avalon. “There is at least increased confidence in what Apple can do in the future,” he said. Kevin Walkush, a portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management who loaded up on Apple shares near last year’s lows, is one of those confident investors. “Apple is turning into the big Caddy that’s going to cruise down the freeway, and there’s a certain class of investors that are really comfortable with that. And we’re that kind of investor,” he said. Heavy buying of Apple shares by Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway, and by Apple itself has also helped support the stock price, accounting for one month’s trading volume in the shares, according to Cybart’s calculations. Berkshire is now Apple’s fifth-largest shareholder, owning 2.61 per cent of the company as of Feb. 27. In recent years, as U.S. phone carriers have stopped subsidizing the purchase of new phones, consumers have been holding on to their old smartphones longer than the typical two-year upgrade cycle. The last time Apple made big changes to its phone lineup was in 2014, when it first introduced models with larger screens. Expectations are high that the new iPhones coming out this year will have enough improvements to prompt a big wave of new purchases. “People are excited about a feature-rich launch,” said Timothy Arcuri, a technology analyst at Cowen & Co. But as Apple pushes the innovation envelope, there are risks. The company has been having difficulty with the new type of fingerprint reader needed for its most advanced iPhone, which is expected to have a screen that runs edge to edge, with no physical home button, Arcuri said. He said Apple had just a few more weeks to work out the kinks if it hoped to meet its traditional September release date. Otherwise, it will have to delay the new phones or put the fingerprint reader on the back of the phone – a clunky solution adopted by Samsung for its Galaxy S8 phone that has been panned by reviewers. “They’re wringing their hands,” Arcuri said of Apple. Even if Apple’s new iPhones fail to deliver a large sales increase, investors are also hoping for changes in tax law that will benefit Apple. Last week, the Trump administration proposed a broad-based cut in the corporate tax rate and hinted at a possible tax break for profits held overseas that could prompt Apple to bring back tens of billions of dollars in foreign profits and distribute them to shareholders. Potential breakthroughs are also in the works. The company is developing augmented reality technology, including eyeglasses, that will overlay real objects with digital ones. Some expect a rudimentary form of augmented reality to show up in the next iPhone. And two weeks ago, Apple received a permit from California regulators to begin testing self-driving cars on public roads. Technological leaps like those would win back skeptics like Landis. “History says that Apple does great but they never shake up the world,” he said. “I need them to surprise me.” Report Typo/Error Also on The Globe and Mail Apple CEO Tim Cook takes aim at Trump (Reuters)   AAPL-QApple Inc Latest Price$143.65 0.00 (0.00%) Updated April 28 4:00 PM EDT. Delayed by at least 15 minutes.

Anthony Caruana May 1, 2017, 12:00pm ⋅ Filed to:  Australian Stories usb-c video feature Share As part of my project to find a perfect Windows 10 device for me, I'm currently testing a Dell XPS 13. I'm not going to pre-empt my review as it's still a work in progress. But The Dell, MacBook and several other systems on the market have decided to put all their eggs in the USB-C basket. And that's proving to be an epic pain with suitable devices, cables and other peripherals still relatively hard to get. The case for USB-C There's a lot to like about USB-C connectors. Unlike the more common USB-A, it's an anyway-is-up connector so you don't have to be too careful about which way to poke it into a connector. And it can replace a bunch of other connectors as the one connector is good for power, data and video. So, in theory, you can carry one or two identical cables in your bag and you're set for almost anything. Assuming the cable is well made, the connector is physically robust with no annoying pins to bend or snap. As the connector is very slim, it means devices can be kept slim and therefore easier to carry and a little lighter. The market seems to be the problem The problem I'm finding is many computer makers seem to be of the mind that if a port can do lots of things that you need fewer ports. Apple, of course, is the worst offender with the MacBook with just one port that's meant to manage you peripheral connections, power input and video output. Apple's solution is a very inelegant and expensive array of dongles. Or you can resort to one of the many USB-C docking devices. Or you can buy a bunch of new cables. Neither alternative appeals to me and, as a frequent traveller, dongles and adapters are just one more thing for me to pack and have to keep tabs on when working remotely or organising my kit. Even Apple, who was first to market with USB-C, makes a USB-C to Lightning cable for iPhone connection an extra cost. I'm packing for a week long trip to the US and find myself packing several extra cables and a mini-docking station in order to make sure I can connect something as simple as a USB stick. What should the market do? Apple, Dell and all the other computer makers that offer USB-C only devices should either include USB-C to USB-A adapter or make it a very inexpensive optional accessory - and not $75. At least Dell's option is just $29 - which is still about $24 too much in my view. I know we are in a transitional stage with USB-A connectors still prevalent after a two-decade legacy. But it seems that many hardware makers don't really care and just expect us to re-accessorise completely when we buy a new computer. Perhaps I'm being hypersensitive about this as I'm currently switching computer every week or so so every thing that makes that more difficult tends to get on my nerves a little. Have you had to make the USB-C switch? What were your solutions? This article was originally published on Lifehacker. Comments phil @phil May 1, 2017, 12:33pm Perhaps I'm being hypersensitive about this as I'm currently switching computer every week That's the nub of it. The benefits of USB-C outweigh the slight inconvenience over the next couple of years. And if, as you've pointed out for USB-A, the ports will be around for 20+ years, at least you'll get some decent use out of any new cables etc. Reply 0 skrybe @skrybe May 1, 2017, 12:42pm I've been trying to get USB-C support on any new devices (new mobo, new phones) but to date I don't have any other USB-C gear (like memory sticks, external HDDs etc). So it's a bit of a non-starter. I too like the fact it's practically impossible to get the connector the wrong way round and it's smaller. But it is an annoying daisy chain to connect stuff at the moment. Transferring data from my old phone to the new one needed a cable and two separate dongles :( I understand that it's the way of the future and a "good thing" but it's definitely annoying that some devices are dropping existing connectors entirely. I'd have thought it'd make more sense to have a generation (or two) of devices with both USB A and C ports to make the transition smoother. After USB-C is wider spread and more peripherals are available then drop the older ports. Video cards are a good example of doing it right. VGA has transitioned to DVI, DisplayPort and HDMI but rather than just dropping older ports for the latest they typically have a mix of ports and include adapters. It's much better to plug your existing gear (monitor) into a native port rather than having to muck about with dongles. And if you ARE going to use dongles then they should be shipped with the first couple "transition" products to make customers life easier. And I don't like the idea of having a single (or limited number) port (no matter what type of connection) and expecting customers to swap stuff in and out. It's not so bad on a phone but on a laptop I'd expect multiple ports so I could plug in a mouse and an external HDD/USB stick and be able to charge it at the same time. Shouldn't need to buy a hub/dock unless you're planning to connect a dozen things to it. Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus May 1, 2017, 4:26pm Laptops have always been the bastard stepchildren when it comes to port types. Limited motherboard space usually means they're stuck with just one type of port the same way phones are so if they're going USB-C it's a pain to squeeze some USB-A ports on there as well. That said, any desktop or laptop with only a single USB-C port is stupid and doing it wrong. USB-C seems to be slow to take up on motherboards and cases at the moment which is disappointing, but with basically all the major phone brands switching this year it should be a good kick in the arse to move faster. More case availability will eventually mean more native USB-C devices like memory sticks too. It's slow at the start but once it gets actually moving it'll take off in a flash. Reply 0 tonyintsv @tonyintsv May 1, 2017, 12:45pm I have the Pixel, I got 2 cables in the kit, one USB-C to USB-C and one USB-C to USB-A and an adaptor. I bought another USB-C to USB-A for the car and never had a problem. Reply 0 feroshious @feroshious May 1, 2017, 1:31pm Galaxy S8 came with a similar deal. I think any phone with USB-C does? Apple excluded? Reply 0 mattyman @mattyman May 1, 2017, 3:15pm LG V20 only came with USB A to USB C. Given that there are hardly any devices out there with USB C support yet, I think this was a logical choice. I ended up getting a couple of extra long high quality USB A to C cables anyway. Reply 0 joel_rainor @joel_rainor May 1, 2017, 1:09pm I bought a Pixel and it came is a C to C and a C to A connector. I tried to buy more cables on the Google store for $50 each but they were sold out. Telstra were selling Micro-USB to USB-C adapters for $20. I felt it was steep at the time but I bought two, one for work and one home. I loved these little adapters because it meant I could use my 3m XBox One controller cable to charge my phone. I dread to think how much a 3m USB-C cable is worth. But when the Nintendo Switch came out, the system came with a USB-C to mains power adapter and the pro-controller also came with a USB-C cable. So now I feel like I'm swimming in them. Between all these cables and adapters; I'm never at a loss for power. The only thing I've changed personally is if I'm leaving my house for a long period of time or crashing at a friends house, I make sure to take one of those adapters with me. Most people have a Micro-USB charger so if I'm at their house I can still charge my phone. Reply 0 blake @blake May 1, 2017, 1:48pm Nintendo Switch uses USB-C to charge the unit, came with a USB-C to USB-A for plugging into the dock. Reply 0 ad_mechx_pwa @ad_mechx_pwa May 1, 2017, 2:13pm I like my Razer Book Stealth, 2 USB A ports and 1 USB C (thunderbolt 3) port, all the benefits of having both. Can't say I've used the USB C port for anything other than power. It's sad that 99% of monitors don't support it, when that changes the world of USB-C/thunderbolt 3 will be beautiful. A really important note is to understand the difference between a thunderbolt 3 port and a usb-c port. In technical terms USB-C (3.1) alone offers no real advantage over USB A (3.0) other than the form factor (which is awesome). but Thunderbolt 3 means that you're actually using a PCI-e bus port which is how you can get your sweet 47gbps and run multiple monitors, external graphics cards and other high speed peripherals.

Samsung Galaxy S8: The Gizmodo Review Mario Aguilar 30 Apr 2017 7:00 AM With the exploding Note7 battery fiasco, Samsung inadvertently did something that's increasingly difficult these days. It made smartphones interesting for a flickering moment. Super interesting, in fact. Besides the intrigue of the mournful saga of Note7, whose embarrassing recall cost the company billions, Samsung also set up a dramatic release narrative for the Galaxy S8. This wasn't just another smartphone -- this was a make-or-break device charged with saving a company in the throes of an existential crisis. A smartphone that screams at the void -- yikes!

A true disruptive technology, which shakes up an existing industry (think Apple in music or mobile or Uber in the taxi business) or dominates an entirely new one (think Facebook or Google), is the Holy Grail for investors. But of all the disrupters, two companies—technological innovator Amazon.com AMZN, +0.72%   and financial services provider Vanguard—have had the biggest impact on established industries that employ millions of people. Both have been big winners at key inflection points where online retailing and passive, low-cost investing became the new paradigms. Amazon planned for that for years, while Vanguard was ahead of its time perhaps initially and then in the right place at the right time. Importantly, Amazon, though one of the biggest public companies, couldn’t care less about quarterly earnings, while Vanguard, which is owned by its funds, isn’t even public. That has let both companies build their businesses for the long haul free of Wall Street’s greedy meddling. Amazon may disrupt several industries, from brick-and-mortar retail to shipping. Annual revenue has increased nearly 12-fold since 2006, to $136 billion in 2016. It’s the fourth most valuable U.S. company, with a market capitalization of $435 billion, its share price having risen 50% over the past 12 months. CEO Jeff Bezos is now the second-wealthiest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $75.6 billion as of March 29. That wealth was built on innovation, operational genius and extraordinary attention to customers’ needs. Amazon has launched products like the Kindle, Echo, and Alexa, and sold them aggressively. It keeps pushing the envelope on shipping time—it’s experimented with drones and one-to-two-hour delivery. It’s developed a video service that’s competitive with Netflix and has produced original television shows and motion pictures, like Oscar winner “Manchester by the Sea”. Its lucrative Amazon Prime service may have 80 million subscribers. It dominates public cloud computing. Amazon, which earns half of all dollars spent online, is the leading culprit in the Retail Apocalypse. In the first quarter of 2017, 14 retail chains have announced they’re seeking bankruptcy protection. Retail consultant Walter Loeb calculates nearly 3,600 U.S. retail outlets will close this year. Amazon may top Macy’s M, -0.98%   in apparel sales this year, is opening several experimental bricks-and-mortar stores, and is even selling groceries. The company employs 341,000 people in full- and part-time (many of them low paid) positions and plans to hire 100,000 more. My MarketWatch colleague Rex Nutting calculates that Amazon could kill two million American jobs — more than China did. You can’t get more disruptive than that. Vanguard was a great innovator when it launched in 1975, and since then it’s stuck to the philosophy of low-cost, mostly index investing formulated by its founder, John C. Bogle. Lately, it has become the dominant force in retail investing while making big inroads into the institutional market. In the last three years, The New York Times reported, investors put $823 billion into Vanguard funds vs. a net $97 billion for the other 4,000 fund firms. So more than eight times as much money went to Vanguard as to everybody else. The firm’s assets under management (AUM) have quadrupled over the past seven years and now exceed $4 trillion, second only to BlackRock. Vanguard has been the chief beneficiary of a sea change in investing, accelerated by the rise of exchange traded funds, where it also is runner-up to BlackRock. Index funds now comprise 40% of total U.S. equity fund assets, double their percentage a decade ago (although a quarter of Vanguard’s assets are actively managed). “It’s completely been an outcome rather than a goal,” Jamey Delaplane, a principal in Vanguard’s Retail Investor Group, told me. “We are not doing new and different things to try to grow faster or bigger, absolutely not. We are trying to be very, very focused on the client.” Vanguard’s whole brand equity is being the low-cost provider. “Vanguard continues to do what they do, which is cut costs, cut costs, cut costs, and they’ve been very good at marketing the notion—rightly—that lower costs accrue to the investors,” said Dan Wiener, chairman and CEO of Adviser Investments, which manages more than $4 billion and invests in Vanguard funds. Wiener says the rapid growth has taken its toll—he’s gotten lots of complaints from Vanguard customers about poor service. “They forgot that they needed to invest in infrastructure, invest in people,” he told me. Delaplane acknowledged Vanguard has seen “a slight uptick” in client complaints recently, but said it’s “a very, very small share of our overall client base.” Still, Vanguard plans to hire 2,000 more people in 2017 (it has 16,000 employees now) and it’s also investing heavily in systems and technology—a tacit admission of some growing pains. That’s a good problem to have. As Vanguard and Amazon show, it’s better to be a shark than a minnow. Howard R.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Microsoft Stays Upbeat in Light of Falling Surface Sales in Q1 | Main | Dubai's Crown Prince gets Private Tour of New Apple Store » April 29, 2017 Foxconn to make 'Capital Intensive' Investment in the U.S. that will be revealed at a Special Event this Summer On Thursday Patently Apple posted a report titled "Foxconn's Chairman Terry Gou and President Trump are set to Meet Next Thursday." We noted in the report that The impression was that the meeting would be next Thursday considering that the Nikkei report was dated Friday April 28, 2017." We're learning this morning that in fact Foxconn's chairman was in Washington the very day of our report.  We're further learning that as Terry Gou exited the White House on day two at the White House that he told the press he's planning to make a "capital-intensive" investment in the United States.    More specifically, Gou stated that "We are planning a number of investments in America. This project will include both capital-intensive and skilled labor-intensive and high-tech investment."   When asked how much money he plans to invest, Gou said he wanted that to be a White House announcement. "We're still not final yet," he said. "I think we will share with you in the summer, maybe a few weeks."   Asked if he had met with Trump, Gou said: "I don't want to say yes or no. After we select the location, the White House will make an announcement."   Gou also visited the White House on Thursday, along with senior company executives including Vice Chairman Tai Jeng-wu, who is also chief of Japan's Sharp Corp, in which Foxconn holds a two-thirds stake.   The Nikkei further reported that Foxconn said in a statement after Gou spoke: "We can confirm that we are engaged in discussions with officials at various levels of government regarding our ongoing plans to significantly increase our investments in the United States."   In January Patently Apple posted a report titled "Foxconn Plan Close to Completion for a Massive U.S. Plant in the U.S. to Make LCD Displays and More." In that report we noted that a Sharp executive stated that Hon Hai Precision Industry (Foxconn) and its Japanese subsidiary Sharp have begun studying the possibility of building a liquid crystal display panel plant in the U.S. The plan is "on the table," the executive said. "We will make a decision carefully." Considering that Vice Chairman Tai Jeng-wu, who is also chief of Japan's Sharp Corp, was with Gou at the White House likely indicates that at least one of the deals does in fact revolve around a Sharp display plant.   The photo above was used in the January report clearly showing that when Softbank's Chairman met with President-Elect Trump, the proposal Mazayoshi Son was holding up to the cameras did indeed show Softbank and Foxconn which we were first to point out.   LCD's are still important in the TV display business. We noted back in December that Terry Gou deliberately dropped Samsung as a Sharp customer that sent Samsung into a panic for months. Sharp supplied LCD's to Samsung.   Sharp had announced a goal of roughly doubling current global sales of its Aquos-brand LCD TVs to 10 million units in fiscal 2018.   In the end, the mystery is in Gou revealing that they're planning "a number of investments in America." Will any of these investments relate to Apple? Only time will tell.    About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Better Buy: Infinera Corporation vs. Skyworks Solutions Which connectivity player is the better long-term play at current prices? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Apr 30, 2017 at 4:06PM Infinera (NASDAQ:INFN) and Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) both provide hardware that connects devices across vast networks. Infinera provides fiber optic systems for telecom companies, while Skyworks supplies radio frequency (RF) chips for a wide range of industries. It's widely believed that the number of connected devices will surge over the next few years. Cisco estimates the figure will double from 25 billion to 50 billion between 2015 and 2020, potentially boosting the revenues of connectivity players like Infinera and Skyworks. Image source: Getty Images. But over the past 12 months, Infinera shares have tumbled more than 30%, as Skyworks shares have soared more than 40%. Let's examine both companies to see why the former floundered and the latter flourished -- and whether or not those trajectories will continue throughout the rest of the year. What do Infinera and Skyworks Solutions sell? Infinera mainly provides Long Haul Wave Division Multiplexing (WDM) optical transmission systems to service providers. These systems allow telcos to boost their network capacity over long distances without laying down additional fiber or overhauling their networks. Infinera's proprietary PIC (photonic integrated circuit) manufacturing process gives it a cost advantage against most of its direct competitors in the Long Haul WDM space. The company also recently diversified into the metro WDM and DCI (data center interconnect) markets, which cover shorter distances. Like many other fiber players, Infinera is highly dependent on telco upgrades in China to boost its top line growth. Image source: Skyworks. Skyworks' RF chips are used across the mobile, automotive, broadband, wireless infrastructure, home automation, industrial, and military markets for M2M (machine to machine) communications. However, Skyworks is primarily known as an Apple supplier. Skyworks doesn't disclose exactly how much of its revenue comes from Apple, but earlier estimates by Oppenheimer & Co. claimed that 40% of its top line came from chips for iDevices. Skyworks believes that its dependence on Apple and other smartphone makers will wane over the next few years as sales of RF chips for Internet of Things (IoT) products like connected cars, smart home appliances, and wearables rise. How fast are Infinera and Skyworks growing? Infinera's revenue has fallen annually for two consecutive quarters. Its revenue fell 31% annually last quarter, and Wall Street expects it to finish the year with an 8% decline. Infinera blamed that softness on a "historical overexposure" to the long haul WDM market, which many service providers shunned in favor of upgrading connections over shorter distances (with metro WDM and DCI systems). However, cyclical demand for long haul WDM will likely improve, and Infinera's newer metro WDM and DCI businesses are still expected to grow. That's why Infinera's revenue is expected to rebound 16% next year. Wall Street expects Infinera to post a non-GAAP loss this year, but it's expected to return to profitability next year. Skyworks' revenue rose 10% annually on robust iPhone sales last quarter, reversing three straight quarters of year-over-year declines. Analysts expect Skyworks' revenue to rise 9% this year and 10% next year. On the bottom line, Skyworks is expected to grow its non-GAAP earnings by 12% this year and 14% next year. A $500 million buyback, which was authorized in the first quarter, also indicates that management is confident that the stock still has room to run. Those numbers look solid, but investors should be mindful of Skyworks' exposure to Apple -- if the upcoming iPhone 8 disappoints consumers, the stock could give up its gains very quickly. Dividends and valuations Infinera has never paid out a dividend, and its wobbly earnings growth indicates that it won't likely announce one anytime soon. Skyworks pays a forward dividend yield of 1.1%, which is supported by a low payout ratio of 23%. The company has consistently hiked that dividend every year since introducing it in 2014. Infinera's P/E remains negative due to its lack of profitability, but its price-to-sales ratio of 1.9 is slightly lower than its industry average of 2.2. Skyworks trades at 22 times earnings, which is lower than its industry average of 28, but its P/S ratio of 6 is much higher than the industry average of 3.9. However, the bulls might argue that premium is easily justified by its high exposure to Apple's growth. The winner: Skyworks Solutions Infinera underperformed many of its peers in the fiber optic industry because it relied too heavily on Long Haul WDM over shorter-range technologies. That cyclical market might eventually turn in its favor, but fiber optic component plays like Oclaro and shorter-range players like Acacia Communications are probably better fiber optic plays for now. I personally don't like Skyworks' heavy dependence on Apple, but it's still one of the best iPhone supply chain plays on the market today. Moreover, its stable top and bottom line growth, reasonable valuations, and room for dividend growth make it a smarter buy than Infinera at current prices. Leo Sun owns shares of Cisco Systems.

Starting with the just 98,000 jobs added in March, there was a drop in CPI inflation, weak retail sales and the squishy first-quarter growth of just 0.7 percent, reported Friday. "We know with the 4.5 percent unemployment rate, the economy is at full employment. How bad can the labor market reading be?" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. "If it's another weak report, that would call into question whether March really did have some weather-related issues." Economists expect 185,000 nonfarm payrolls, but many expected more than 200,000 last month and got less than half. "Another weakling jobs report, two in a row would make people wonder about the strength of the economy," said Rupkey. Economists have written off part of the first quarter's softness due to a very warm January and February, followed by winter storms in March. They are mostly forecasting a bump higher in the second quarter, with growth as high as 3 percent or more. But individual economic reports will have to support the turn. So far the stock market has ignored the economic data misses and focused instead on this quarter's super-strong earnings. "It is very important to observe the economic data next week, the point being that the consumer sentiment index actually declined a little bit. There's a very sharp divergence between confidence and economic performance. Our work has shown in that when confidence starts to turn equity market performance and market multiples start to turn as well," said Julian Emanuel, equity and derivatives strategist at UBS. "Very important is going to be the employment data. Obviously with the French election coming on May 7, I don't think [the Fed is] going to change their tone at all." There will also be a focus on geopolitical events. Tensions between North Korea and the U.S. remain in the headlines, as North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile Friday evening which failed. There is also the second round of the French election on May 7. Markets have been trading more calmly since the first round results were announced last Sunday. Centrist Emmanuel Macron is now expected to win the presidency, over Marine Le Pen, a far-right candidate who wants to take France off the euro. Earnings, earnings, earnings By the end of the coming week, most S&P 500 companies will have reported first-quarter earnings. Reports are expected from a diverse group of companies. Apple tops the list Tuesday, but there will also be reports from Facebook, (FB) Pfizer, BP, Viacom, Kraft Heinz (KHC) and MasterCard. The expectation is that S&P companies' profits could be up 13.6 percent or more, based on actual reports and forecasts for companies that have not yet reported, according to Thomson Reuters. Seventy-seven percent of companies reporting have beaten profit forecasts so far. The S&P closed up 1.5 percent for the week, its best week since Jan 6. For the month of April, the index was up 0.9, its fifth positive month in six. "I think the big story behind the U.S. equity market is earnings. We're right smack in the middle of what's going to be the best quarter since the fourth quarter of 2011," said Leo Grohowski, CIO of BNY Mellon Wealth Management. "We have an equity-friendly economic backdrop. ... The economy is not going strongly but it's growing enough to generate earnings growth, and it's growing slow enough to keep the earnings expectations at bay." Emanuel said earnings that beat estimates are not being rewarded at the same degree as those that miss are being punished. "Earnings alone at this aggregate market level is not enough to move the market materially higher. You need policy and you need economic performance." He said the economic reports will take on more importance in the coming week, since they may reveal whether the second quarter is showing improvement or still dragging. Econorama Economists expect to see a recovery in the April employment report, when it is scheduled to be released Friday morning. The expectation for 185,000 jobs includes 13,000 manufacturing jobs, according to Thomson Reuters. Average hourly wages are expected to rise 0.3 percent. Besides the jobs report, there is a whole slate of economic data that are important in the week ahead. On Monday, two crucial measures of manufacturing activity are released — the ISM manufacturing survey and Markit's manufacturing PMI. There are also vehicle sales Tuesday, which could be important after a surprisingly large drop-off in March. There is also personal income and spending Monday, and the important personal consumption expenditures index, Fed Chair Janet Yellen's favorite measure of inflation. "On Monday, we might have some heads turned by PCE inflation. Yellen's looking at core PCE inflation," said Rupkey. "It's possible March data could be a little on the softer side for core PCE inflation, short of 2 percent. I wouldn't be surprised if it's 1.7 percent." Core excludes food and energy, and 2 percent is the Fed's target for inflation. Headline PCE was above 2 percent in the first quarter but core inflation has running behind it. For March, CPI inflation data was also surprisingly weak. With the sluggish growth and softer inflation, the concern is the Fed will be hiking interest rates this year in too soft conditions. Market expectations for a Fed rate rise in June, however, are more than 60 percent, as economists wait for the expected turn up in the economy. "It's a very odd market. You get the fed fund futures saying 64 percent of a rate hike in June, but why aren't 10-year Treasury yields a little bit higher," said Rupkey. The 10-year Treasury (US10Y) was yielding 2.28 percent Friday. Inflation data will be important ahead of the Fed meeting, and for expectations of further central bank rate hikes this year. There are a number of Fed speakers after this week's meeting, with Yellen appearing Friday in a webcast at Brown University. Emanuel said the Fed is not likely to change its tone at this week's meeting, particularly since the data are questionable. "People are waiting to see whether or not over the next several weeks the anticipated pickup in the economy materializes," said Emanuel.

The “cheap-chic” discount chain has signed a lease for a 23,580-square-foot store in the Queens neighborhood that will be part of a new, 80,000-square-foot building being developed by Sun Equity Partners and the Heskel Group, The Post has learned. In an unusual twist, the lease at 40-31 82nd St. specifically singles out rival cosmetics boutiques Sephora and Ulta from opening stores at the project. The move is seen as an effort by Target to try to protect sales of its own makeup and beauty products. In fact, Ulta had been in talks to open a store at the Jackson Heights development — talks that got scuttled by Target’s rider, according to a source close to the deal. As usual, Target’s Jackson Heights lease forbids rival supermarkets, pharmacies and convenience stores, as well as down-market venues like massage parlors, laundromats and second-hand stores. But the rider also specifically bans fulfillment centers for online retailers — likely an attempt to block possible Amazon pickup stores that are in the early stages of development at the Seattle-based Web giant. Target’s deal to open a new store at 112 W. 34th St. across from the Macy’s flagship in Herald Square, first reported by The Post on March 19, also banned Ulta. But a Sephora had already leased in the building. That rider also did not ban online-fulfillment centers. SEE ALSO Massive Target store coming to Midtown 0:0 Macy’s is getting a new neighbor in Manhattan. “Cheap chic”... Target already has several locations in Queens including in Forest Hills, at SkyView Center, Elmhurst and in College Point. The retailer is perfecting its small-store format for urban areas along with neighborhood-specific merchandise. Larger stores can run over 130,000 square feet. The Jackson Heights site previously housed a defunct 82nd Street movie theater that was purchased by the developers for $27 million last fall. “It’s a great endorsement for the mostly Hispanic neighborhood,” said Heskel Elias, CEO of the Heskel Group, of the Target deal. Peter Ripka and Jeffrey Howard of Ripco Realty represented Target, while David Alani and Michael Friedman of Inline Realty worked for the developers. The asking rent was $50 per square foot for the lower-level space with its own ground-floor entrance. The 15-year lease, dated March 31, includes three five-year options to extend.

Apple is exploring charging over Wi-Fi instead. by Cara McGoogan Apple is investigating ways to charge iPhones and iPads wirelessly and without contact using the signal emitted by radio frequencies such as Wi-Fi, a patent filing has revealed. The indication the company is working on the system will raise hopes that the end of having to physically plug a cable into a mobile device in order to charge it could be around the corner.   The filing reveals Apple is looking at ways to re-power its devices using mobile, Wi-Fi and millimetre wave signals. It proposes directing the electromagnetic frequencies, normally used for data transmission, towards device as a "beam" of energy.  Long-range wireless charging isn't a new concept and Apple has been working on different ways to achieve it for a number of years. It first filed a patent for a way to wirelessly recharge an iMac at a distance of one metre back in 2010. A Samsung S6 is charged wirelessly. Bloomberg Last year, Bloomberg reported that the company was working with partners to develop the system for mobile devices. It said it could be introduced to the iPhone as early as this year.  Related Quotes 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating... Last updated: Updating... View full quote Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements While the patent filing is the greatest hint yet that Apple is working on the technology, it only covers the theory behind the method rather than an actual way to do it.  Glass case Rumours suggest that Apple is planning to introduce wireless charging to the iPhone for the first time this year in time for its 10-year anniversary. Adding weight to reports, the company joined an industry group called the Wireless Power Consortium in February.   However, the method of wireless charging that Apple could use is still unclear. It had been claimed that the iPhone would not feature the short-range "inductive" wireless charging used on the Watch and rival phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S8. Instead, Apple was said to be waiting to introduce wireless charging on the handsets only when it had developed a long-range system. But the recent patent appears to be too early stage. Apple patented a separate "inductive charging station" concept for the iPhone last northern autumn, paving the way for short-range wireless charging on the iPhone 8. The upcoming handset is rumoured to come with a glass case that could support the feature.  Wireless charging What is wireless charging? Using an electromagnetic field to transfer energy between two objects (e.g. a battery) When was it invented? Nikola Tesla first demonstrated it in 1891 How does it work? Currently the majority of wireless charging-supported phones work by resting the handset on an inductive charging pad or mat. Which phones currently support it? The majority of high-end Android handsets feature wireless charging, including the Samsung Galaxy S7, LG G4, Microsoft Lumia 1520, Blackberry Priv Z30 and Google Nexus 6. What's good about it? All wireless charging-supported phones can be charged on the same pads or mats, doing away with phone-specific chargers. magazine.afr.com The Telegraph, London Share Share via Email Share on Google Plus Post on facebook wall Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit Advertisement Advertisement Related articles Tech giant SAP goes on Aussie hiring binge Apple surges as investors bet on new iPhones Israeli encryption start-up heads for the ASX Tesla loses consumer reports top rating You can buy a piece of this Sydney flat for $57 Contains: Video Latest Stories ASX see-saws higher 3 mins ago Contains: Video China's ENN and Hony muscle up on Santos 3 mins ago How to get enough income to retire 3 mins ago More Australia's 50 biggest private philanthropists Giving back to society Meet the 2017 Bulgari Art Award winner The family battle behind the sale of the Kidman empire Why a $350 wine needs a backstory Where the business crowd meets in Hanoi How big companies keep their top performers Dame of Drones' advice for emerging leaders The Wolf of Wall St Corporate stupidity and what to do about it The best new (and fun) luxury gifts David Umemoto's meditations in concrete Travel tip: forget travelling light Coffee a star ingredient in Tokyo fine dining Look inside the best Australian properties Special Reports PRRT changes kicked down the road Five key steps in the life cycle of a vehicle Charting the best maintenance method debatable City of Spectres Telematics industry changing tack Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd © Copyright 2017 Reprints & Permissions Privacy Policy Terms & Conditions of Use Experience afr.com free for 1 month Enjoy unlimited access to Australia's best business news and market insights across desktop, tablet and mobile Find out more Already a subscriber?

By TrippMickle Apple Inc. is expected to report Tuesday that its stockpile of cash has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, an unrivaled corporate hoard that is greater than the market value of both Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -0.34%   and Procter & Gamble Co. PG, -0.41%   and exceeds the combined foreign-currency reserves held by the U.K. and Canada combined. The money, more than 90% which is stockpiled outside of the U.S., has drawn fresh attention as President Donald Trump has proposed slashing business taxes and a one-time tax holiday on corporate cash brought home. That could ratchet up pressure on the tech giant to make splashy acquisitions or dole out more money to shareholders.

In the last three months of 2016, it racked up new cash at a rate of about $3.6 million an hour. As of December, the company had $246.09 billion total cash, cash equivalents, and securities. Apple, like many big American companies, parks most of that cash offshore rather than paying U.S. taxes on its overseas profits. An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.

Wayne Cuddington / Postmedia Share Adjust Comment Print NEW YORK — The Ottawa Senators were all business as they headed to the Big Apple Sunday afternoon. They may be up 2-0 in the Eastern Conference semifinal against the New York Rangers after a thrilling 6-5 double-overtime victory at the Canadian Tire Centre Saturday, but the Senators know they haven’t won anything yet. There’s a lot of work left to do if they’re going to win this series with Game 3 set for Tuesday night. The Senators didn’t go on the ice Sunday. They instead met at the MacDonald-Cartier Airport and boarded their Air Canada charter. It was a day to rest, relax and recover before they hit the ice Monday morning for practice at Madison Square Garden. “On my God, we have everything to do,” coach Guy Boucher told reporters Sunday before leaving Ottawa. “It’s not like (their) last series where they won the two games on the road (against Montreal) and they’re coming home. We won at home, games we have to win at home, and now we’re going to play in their barn. “We enjoy playing there. I think we did well there, but at the same time we know the kind of urgency they’re going to bring to the next game. I know they talked about reloading because they’ve got two days off and figuring out what they have to do beat us and I think we have to do the same. We’ve got to get back to the drawing board and make sure we’re not surprised by anything they’re going throw at us.” Yes, the Senators had timely goals Saturday to come back from a two-goal deficit in the final four minutes — especially with the four-goal effort from centre Jean-Gabriel Pageau — but the game was far from textbook. The club went 0-for-4 on the power play, gave up two shorthanded goals and allowed 48 shots on Craig Anderson. The Senators will never be perfect, but they can be improved and that’s why they’re buoyed being up 2-0 in this series. They likely haven’t played their best game, yet they’re sitting in a good position. Mistakes are going to happen in hockey. However, Boucher doesn’t like the kind of chances they’re giving up. Ottawa has had success this year because the team has played with structure and Boucher felt the club did a better job once it went to the extra period in cutting down on the scoring chances on Anderson. “Our overtime was really good. I thought we really looked like ourselves and I thought we cleaned up a few things that we don’t want to see,” Boucher said. After Game 1 Thursday, Boucher felt the Senators would need to record 40 shots per-game on Henrik Lundqvist if they were going to have success. That theory went out the window in Game 2 when Ottawa scored six goals on 28 shots which should bode well for their confidence going into these next two games on the road. “We’re going into their building and we know that they’re going to come (out hard),” said alternate captain Dion Phaneuf. “(Saturday) we got lucky in that we were able to find a way, but we can’t spot them those leads because, when you’re chasing a game, it’s going to eventually catch up to you. “But we’re really happy with finding a way, but we know we have to be better.” The Senators have a great opportunity in the next two games. Not only can they push the Rangers to the brink of elimination with a victory in Game 3, the Senators have never swept a playoff series in their team history. Make no mistake, Ottawa has plenty of respect for the Rangers and Ottawa players know this series is far from being over. The Rangers served notice in the second period Saturday that they’re tough customers. They controlled much of the play, made life difficult for the Senators and didn’t give the home team much. The key for the Senators was their ability to respond and that’s something they’ve been able to do all season. Getting the two wins at home was a huge step for the Senators. “We wanted to cement home ice and we’re fortunate to have home ice in the second round,” said winger Mark Stone. “We weren’t at our best (Saturday), we got a big penalty kill with six minutes left in the game and then (Pageau) made two big plays to get us to 5-5. “At this time of year, you have to find ways to win. No game in the playoffs is easy to win. For us, I think that last four minutes (of Game 1), we kept it quite simple. You look at the goals, none of them were pretty, perfect plays.” The Senators have a perfect record in this series and if they can keep it up, they have the chance to end it quickly. bgarrioch@postmedia.com Twitter: @sungarrioch Jean-Gabriel Pageau Ottawa Senators Sports New York Rangers never saw what hit them Methot is ready for the Rangers' best in New York Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

According to a khaleejtimes.com report, citing Arabic daily Emarat Al Youm, the UAE’s Ministry of Economy stated that only specific iPhone 6s which contain defective batteries made in China during September and October 2015 will be recalled. Apple has recently expressed that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. If you have experienced this issue, the firm has urged residents to use the serial number checker (www.apple.com/ae/support/iPhone6s-unexpectedshutdown/) if your iPhone 6s is eligible for a battery replacement, free of charge.

And at a rally on the steps of City Hall, supporters of the measure are making their case one last time. “Now do it in Arabic!” someone shouts. Demonstrators cheer as a woman wearing a hijab approaches the microphone. But then, everyone freezes. A counter-protester paces in front of them, briefly sending a chill through the crowd. Some people laugh. Others look stunned. The woman is wearing a bright red T-shirt that says “TRUMP 2016.” She has a matching sparkly flower in her hair. She doesn’t say anything. And she doesn’t have to. The hand-written cardboard signs she’s carrying make her message clear: “President Trump says NO! Obey the Law!” “A Sanctuary City is against the LAW of our land.” Two views of the future Valeria Rodriguez Cobos glares at the woman in the Trump T-shirt. She’s frustrated to see her getting so much attention, even though the woman is far outnumbered by pro-immigrant protesters. Rodriguez Cobos has been coming here for months as part of a group of activists pushing for Winston-Salem to become a sanctuary city. The 25-year-old’s mission: using her voice for those who have none. She has a green card, but most of her friends and family don’t. And as she stands on the steps of City Hall tonight, she knows she’s carrying the weight of thousands of people who need help, but aren’t here simply because they’re too scared to show up. The neighbors who panicked when they saw a white van circling their apartment complex, terrified that ICE agents were about to swoop in. The children at her church who went running when police neared their playground. The friend who just asked her to take care of her kids if she gets deported. The counter-protester winds her way into the building. A demonstrator waving a sign saying “HUMAN RIGHTS” follows close behind. The crowd resumes chanting, louder than before. From inside, Joan Fleming can hear them. And it’s making her uneasy. She thinks back to riots she lived through as a child growing up in the 1960s. Her father was a police officer then. She thought of him as she came to City Hall today, carrying an American flag tote bag stuffed with petitions. He raised her to respect the importance of law and order. Back then, when violence flared during protests, she’d wait by the door of her family’s home in Kinston, North Carolina. Every night she feared her father wouldn’t make it back alive. Now as she sits inside the City Council’s meeting room, those fears have been replaced by new ones — growing concerns about what Fleming believes could be just around the corner, and what she feels is lurking in plain sight. She’s already warned the City Council about what she fears will happen if they pass the “welcoming city” proposal: Felons will flock to Winston-Salem. “There are thousands of chances per month for you or your loved one to be killed by a suspected illegal drunk driver,” she told officials at last month’s meeting. Tonight she hopes they’ll remember what she said. Echoes of a larger fight This was the scene on Monday, April 17, in one corner of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, as a controversial vote loomed. But it could be anywhere in America in 2017, as increasingly divisive debates over immigration expose feelings simmering beneath the surface. President Donald Trump made cracking down on illegal immigration a focal point of his administration. He took steps to retaliate against so-called sanctuary cities, vowing to cut off funding to local governments that don’t cooperate with the feds. He doubled down on his message that undocumented immigrants can be a danger to communities, creating an office focused on victims of immigrant crime. Critics say Trump is highlighting crime as a pretext for plans to kick out as many undocumented immigrants as possible, regardless of whether they pose a threat. Since he took office, immigration arrests are up and illegal border crossings are down. But so far, Trump also appears to be deporting fewer people than his predecessor. It’s too soon to say whether these early numbers will translate into a trend. But spend a day in this Southern city, where the salvos of national political battles echo loudly, and you’ll see signs of a deepening shift beyond what’s measured with statistics in spreadsheets. Tensions are high. So are suspicions. And there’s one thing both sides have in common: fear. Sending a message At first, Dan Besse thought his resolution declaring Winston-Salem a welcoming city would sail to approval. The city already prides itself on being a place that’s made immigrants feel at home. Industrial, manufacturing and construction jobs, plus a low cost of living, made Winston-Salem an attractive destination. Now the city that once saw race as a matter of black and white is more than 15% Latino — the largest percentage in any major city in the state. More than 10% of its residents are immigrants. And the Pew Research Center estimates that about 25,000 undocumented immigrants live in the metro area, roughly 4% of the total population. Besse is an attorney who’s been on Winston-Salem’s City Council since 2001. He thought his proposal wouldn’t rock the boat much because it wasn’t creating new rules or overturning any old ones. But he’d heard about mounting fears for immigrants in his city — about parents who were too scared to take their children to doctor’s appointments or leave them in after-school programs, about threats to local mosques. And he wanted to send a symbolic message. “A lot of folks don’t feel safe,” he said, “and they really need this kind of reassurance that their local elected representatives are on their side.” So at a February meeting, Besse unveiled a resolution that he says intended to do just that. It was a compromise move that skirted the word “sanctuary” and some of the more controversial measures activists had proposed, such as a pledge to limit cooperation with federal law enforcement. Among its proclamations: “Whereas, the current national environment of excessive fear and suspicion directed by some toward immigrants, refugees, and other newcomers calls for cities like Winston-Salem to reaffirm our commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive community for all.” In this left-leaning city with a City Council where seven of the eight members are Democrats, it was the kind of message that sounded like an easy sell. Maybe a few years ago, or even a few months ago, it would have been. Besse’s proposal cleared a committee and seemed to be gaining steam among his colleagues. But it wasn’t long before it sparked an uproar. First local Republicans rallied against it. Then state elected officials took aim. At a meeting in Raleigh, they told Winston-Salem to bury the welcoming city measure or risk losing funding. “There will be consequences if Winston-Salem does this,” one state senator warned. ‘Like a rattlesnake’ As she gets ready for the vote, Joan Fleming sits at her kitchen table, staring at her laptop screen. A wood carving of the continental United States hangs behind her, near metal sculpted into cursive lettering that says “Faith” and “Love.” A magnet on her refrigerator says, “Friends don’t let friends vote Democrat.” The lifelong Republican is no stranger to rallying around a cause. Ever since she moved to Winston-Salem in 1990, she’s worked for candidates and campaigns, from Sen. Jesse Helms’ 1996 reelection battle to North Carolina’s 2012 amendment banning same-sex marriage. As she sits at her computer and prepares for a vote she’s very worried her side might lose, she glides her mouse across the elephant on her mousepad that says “Grand Old Party.” Fleming’s phone rings. It’s someone she hopes will be at tonight’s meeting. And she wants to make sure they’ve signed her petition. “I’ve put it on my Facebook about 2,500 times. If you haven’t seen it, you must be living under a rock,” she says. “I don’t know how to put it out there any other way.” Beside her, she has copies of several recent arrest reports — proof, she says, that being too lax about illegal immigration is endangering people in the area. Is it unfair to paint an entire group based on the most severe crimes committed by a handful of people? Fleming doesn’t think so. She suspects the amount of crime connected to illegal immigration is under-reported. And even one crime, she feels, is one crime too many. “It’s a life. It’s a rape,” she says. “If we hadn’t been negligent in letting them in here, it wouldn’t have happened.” She resents it when critics call her and others who oppose Winston-Salem’s proposed welcoming city measure hateful or racist. Fleming says there’s nothing hateful about supporting legal immigration and standing firmly against illegal immigration. “I might like a rattlesnake,” she says, “but I don’t want them in my living room. I lock my doors at night.” If she were a few years younger, Fleming, who’s in her 60s, says she’d head to the Mexican border and build the wall herself. Collecting ammunition Instead, Fleming is spending Monday afternoon on the road, driving around Winston-Salem’s suburbs as she picks up copies of petitions. The vote is only a few hours away, and she knows every signature counts. She heads down a hilly country road, past grazing horses and Baptist churches and an apartment complex called Plantation Place, to collect a stack of papers left for her. The petitions are on top of a Buick parked in a carport with a “Make America Great Again” bumper sticker. She stops in a Chick-fil-A parking lot near a strip mall to get another stack from a friend who’s fallen ill and won’t be able to make it to tonight’s meeting. Fleming doesn’t live inside the city limits. Her home is about a 20-minute drive away, near a golf course in Advance, North Carolina. But most of her family lives in the city. And Fleming says anything that happens inside Winston-Salem will spread. She’s heading to City Hall armed with a tote bag full of testimonials from others who share her views: “I will no longer feel safe as a single female if this happens.” “The safety of our city and our children is at stake.” “Our city is being overrun with aliens. I notice my own neighborhood is being flooded with immigrants. … I don’t feel safe letting my grandchildren play outside unless I am with them. Not the America my children grew up in.” Loud and clear As they chant on the steps outside City Hall, the protesters are sending a very different message: “No ban, no wall, sanctuary for all.” “Fund educations, not deportations.” “Say it loud, say it clear, immigrants are welcome here.” “Hey ya’ll,” Valeria Rodriguez Cobos says into the microphone, smiling at the crowd. Rodriguez Cobos was only a year and a half old when her parents brought her to the United States from their home in Oaxaca, Mexico. For 22 years, she was undocumented. Like many of her family members, she lived in the shadows, terrified that the life she was trying to build could dissolve in an instant. But the 25-year-old is a permanent resident now. Several years ago she was able to petition for legal residency under the Violence Against Women Act after surviving an abusive relationship. Today she’s wearing a black T-shirt with bold white letters on it that say, “free.” Legal immigration status has brought some stability, but she says it’s impossible to feel secure when almost everyone you know is still at risk. Rodriguez Cobos chokes up as she tells the crowd how privileged she feels to have a green card. “It’s something I know my family still doesn’t have,” she says. “So for me, the fight is not over until we’re all safe.” A woman who works with refugees describes the harrowing stories they’ve told her about what happened before they fled their homes. A Wake Forest law professor explains that there’s nothing illegal about the resolution the City Council is finally about to vote on. Besse tells the crowd that whatever happens to his resolution tonight doesn’t really matter. The important thing, he says, is continuing community activism, standing up for what’s right and not letting lawmakers in Raleigh dictate the way the city handles its affairs. “We cannot afford to capitulate to bullying tactics and intimidation, telling us not to speak up and out on behalf of those who are marginalized in our communities.” Pointing toward home Lori Apple watches from a few feet away, wearing a sparkling American flag lapel pin on her jean jacket. The protesters’ words quickly get under the 60-year-old physical therapist’s skin. They seem to be fanning the flames of emotions, she says, rather than relying on facts. Apple, the head of a local Republican women’s association, says the welcoming city resolution quickly drew fire from many people in her party. It’s clear, she says, that the measure is a thinly veiled attempt to turn Winston-Salem into a sanctuary city. That’s extremely unwise, she says, given vows by Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to yank federal funding from local jurisdictions that don’t cooperate with immigration enforcement efforts. And it’s not just federal officials who are threatening to fight back against local measures, she says. State lawmakers in North Carolina outlawed sanctuary cities back in 2015. Then-Gov. Pat McCrory signed the measure in nearby Greensboro. And now, legislators in Raleigh are weighing ways to punish local governments that take sanctuary steps. But Apple says the concerns she and others share aren’t just about the millions of dollars Winston-Salem could stand to lose. She says she’s worried about her family — about the spots they could lose in college, about extra time they could be stuck waiting in emergency rooms, about the ways crime could go up and terrorists could slip in. “I have children and I am concerned with the safety of our community,” she says. “The loud voices of a few drown out the quiet voices of good, hard-working Americans who are not in favor of these kinds of measures.” To sum up her views on immigration, Apple uses her three-bedroom house in Lewisville, about 15 minutes outside Winston-Salem, as a metaphor. There are only so many items in the refrigerator to go around and only so many rooms in the house where there’s space to live, she says. And of course, she keeps the doors locked at night and takes other steps, she says, to protect against intruders. Resources are scarce in America, Apple says. And the country needs to do what it can to keep out terrorists and keep its citizens safe. That’s all the president and North Carolina’s state lawmakers are trying to do, she says. “There’s a lot of anger among people towards Trump,” she says. “But he’s trying to protect us.” ‘I show them safety’ Across town, Carmen is just winding down her day cleaning houses. The 43-year-old undocumented immigrant can’t make it to tonight’s meeting. But she’s been following news of the proposed “welcoming city” measure closely. And she’s hoping the city will pass it. “It would be a safer city,” she says. “It would be a relief for us.” Carmen, who asked to be identified only by her first name to protect her family’s safety, has trouble feeling safe these days. She’s terrified that Trump will end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, putting her three children in jeopardy. She’s afraid jobs for immigrant workers are going to dry up. She’s scared to go out at night. She senses people are giving her hostile glances in stores. It wasn’t like this before, Carmen says. Trump, she says, has planted seeds of hatred across the country. But Carmen says she’s seen love blossoming, too. One day people from a nearby church left signs outside for her church’s largely immigrant congregation. “Somos uno en Cristo.” We are one in Christ. “Dios te ama.” God loves you. “Nos encantan nuestros vecinos.” We love our neighbors. Carmen was overjoyed. She snapped photos of her children with the signs and keeps them on her phone. She’s afraid of what will happen next, but she doesn’t talk about it with her children. “I show another face to them. I show them safety,” she says. “I don’t show them the fear I feel.” A tense wait Inside City Hall, Fleming is one of the first people to arrive in the City Council’s meeting room. It’s already tense. There aren’t enough chairs. Some people whisper. Others glare suspiciously across the room. Fleming settles on a spot in the middle of the third row, then moves to the other side of the room after a man snarls at her for trying to save a seat. Rodriguez Cobos sits with a few friends on the floor of a room upstairs, their eyes trained on a TV screen. So many people have shown up to tonight’s meeting that officials opened two overflow rooms to give them a chance to follow what’s happening. Rodriguez Cobos’ friends are US citizens whose parents are undocumented immigrants, and they’re here to make their voices heard. But as they sit inside the imposing government building, Valeria can see that her friends are spooked. She tries to explain what she knows about city government to them. In between her business administration classes at Salem College and her work at a local credit union, she’s been coming here regularly for months. The pomp and circumstance of a local government meeting is familiar now. The way the clerk reads out the name of each resolution. The way the council members make motions. She wants her friends to feel like they belong here. This is their city, too, even though sometimes it may not feel like it. As tonight’s vote nears, they lean in toward the TV to listen. Caught off guard There’s no fanfare as the clerk announces what’s next on the agenda: “Item G-4, Adoption of the ‘Winston-Salem is a Welcoming City’ Resolution.” This is the moment almost everyone in the building is waiting for. But the mayor makes a surprise announcement that catches many of them off guard. Besse, he says, has asked to withdraw the resolution from the night’s agenda. “He’s working on an alternative thought,” the mayor tells the crowd. Rodriguez Cobos and her friends can’t believe what they’re hearing. She wants to run screaming into the meeting room. How can this be happening? Fleming feels frustrated too. Her rush to get signatures for a petition, her push to save seats inside for fellow Republicans who feel the same way she does — all of it seems like a waste of time. A man rushes to the front of the room, yelling as he heads out the door: “Boo! Cowards!” In the public comment period that ends the meeting, speaker after speaker slams the City Council for letting worries about retribution from state and federal officials stop them from taking a stand. “What we heard today,” one woman says, “was fear.” One man says the move sets a dangerous precedent. “If you allow them to bully you all, then who will they come for next?” Another says he’s tired of hearing people focus on crimes committed by immigrants. “There’s people who look like me who ran people over. There’s people who shot up schools who look like me. Should we deport all of them, too? Are we just going to use fear as our guiding principle?” Rodriguez Cobos is the last person to speak. She says she and others won’t forget how the City Council backed down instead of standing up. “Elections are coming up,” she says, “and people are paying attention.” As Rodriguez Cobos walks to her car after the meeting, she looks over her shoulder. She’s determined to keep speaking out, but she knows it makes her a target. Fleming walks quickly to her car, too. She fears crime is on the rise. And you never know who might be watching. The next battle Winston-Salem’s alt weekly doesn’t mince words in its headline summarizing the council’s move: “Unwelcoming City.” But Besse maintains his proposal isn’t dead. Instead, he says he’s planning to bring it back in a different form. Pulling it from the agenda was a change in tactics, he says, but not a retreat. When he realized the welcoming city resolution wouldn’t have enough support to pass, Besse says he withdrew the measure to avoid sending the wrong signal. These days, he’s carrying a copy of a new document inside his jacket pocket as he walks around Winston-Salem. He’s hoping to convince leaders from across the community to sign on. A joint statement from a broader group touting the city’s welcoming nature, he says, will send a stronger message than any City Council resolution would. Rodriguez Cobos and other organizers with the Sanctuary City Coalition of Winston-Salem say their fight has only just begun. They’ll be marching in an upcoming “day without immigrants” protest. And they’re hoping to take more concrete steps to help protect an immigrant community under siege. One idea: emergency response teams that can report to areas where ICE arrests are taking place. Fleming says she’s keeping a close eye on the City Council in case the welcoming city measure comes up again. And she’s going to keep canvasing for signatures on her petition opposing it. She’s also working on promoting the local Republican women’s club’s next activity: a self-defense class. A family crisis At a church Bible study meeting in northern Winston-Salem, Carmen is looking for answers. The City Council meeting was a few days ago. She’s still hoping officials will change their mind, and she wishes she’d been at City Hall to see what happened. She went once and loved the part where everyone stood together to say the Pledge of Allegiance. But this week, she’s barely had any time to spare. She’s overwhelmed with a crisis that’s shaken her family. Her brother is in a detention center and could be days away from deportation. His devastated 10-year-old daughter is barely talking or eating. All she does is cry. They’re taking her to a psychologist, but Carmen doesn’t know what else to do as she waits for word on whether officials will reopen her brother’s case. “I’m so worried,” she tells the church group, tears streaming down her face. The pastor offers a prayer for Carmen and others at the table. “God, we put our worries and our anguish in front of you. … Touch the hearts of the authorities in this country,” he says. “Touch the hardened hearts that they seem to have right now.” Carmen bows her head. She prays for something she fears only God can give her now. Protection.

Ya Libnan Lebanon News and World News Live from Beirut Featured News Lebanon News World News Opinion Business News Arts & Culture Sci & Tech Video Apple’s cash pile of $250 billion fuels expectations April 30, 2017 by yalibnan Leave a Comment In its quarterly results on Tuesday, Apple Inc. likely will report that its cash hoard has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, an unrivaled milestone for a private corporation that raises a question: Why would any company want to hold that much money? Apple has added to its pile at a blistering pace, doubling it in just over four-and-a-half years. In the last three months of 2016 it wracked up new cash at a rate of about $3.6 million an hour. Its current total, not accounting for debt, exceeds the market values of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and that of Procter & Gamble Co., and outstrips the foreign-currency reserves of the U.K. and Canada combined. The stash has drawn fresh attention recently as President Donald Trump tries to revamp the U.S. tax regime. Apple, like many big companies, keeps most of its cash offshore — some 93% of its $246.09 billion total cash, cash equivalents, and securities as of December — to avoid U.S. corporate taxes that executives consider too high. The Trump administration this week proposed a one-time tax holiday to encourage companies to bring that cash home, and said it wants to slash the U.S. corporate-income-tax rate to 15% from 35% and largely exempt future foreign profits. That could make it easier for Apple to put its money to use, through acquisitions or by doling out more to shareholders. The latter prospect has propelled Apple’s stock to record highs. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook early this year said he was eager to bring cash home if tax changes enable it, and Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said such a move would give Apple flexibility to do more capital returns. Neither has given detailed plans. One possible approach would be a special dividend. Apple could deliver such a windfall, benefitting investors including Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which more than doubled its Apple position in January. Wall Street analysts tend to focus more on companies’ net cash position than the headline number. Apple has racked up some $88 billion in debt to fund payouts to shareholders. But even subtracting that, Apple would be left with more cash than the total stockpile of Microsoft, the next richest tech company, which boasts $126 billion in cash, not accounting for debt. With the exception of financial companies, Apple’s stash exceeds that of any other U.S. company in recent history, said Jennifer Blouin, an accounting professor at University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “I have never seen a company in this kind of extreme position, barring a winding-down,” she said. “Apple’s a cash box right now.” Former executives say Apple’s thrift has deep roots, inspired in part by a brush with bankruptcy in the late 1990s. That forced Chief Executive Steve Jobs to arrange a cash infusion from Microsoft Corp. and set his resolve to keep reserves for future emergencies. Mr. Jobs also believed Apple could better boost its stock price by using its money to develop new products than through buybacks or dividends. His biggest product, the iPhone, has only supercharged the cash machine. Apple has sold more than 1 billion of the devices in the decade since it was introduced, and today claims 91% of all the profits in the smartphone sector. Mr. Cook has been somewhat more accommodating of shareholder desires than his predecessor. He started a dividend-and-stock-buyback program in 2012 that has since sent more than $200 billion to shareholders. And he has invested more in some areas, such as R&D. But the CEO also stared down Carl Icahn in 2013 and 2014 when the activist investor bought a stake in Apple and demanded it increase buybacks. And Apple remains frugal in other realms, such as marketing. It spent less than $1.8 billion on advertising last year — not even half the amounts laid out by smaller rivals Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., according to company filings. Apple also avoids large acquisitions. It bought at a rate of 15 to 20 companies a year over the past four years, generally spending several hundred million dollars on companies it can easily assimilate. Its biggest deal was the $3 billion it spent to buy Beats Electronics LLC in 2014. The swelling war chest has fueled hopes for bigger deals to vault Apple in new directions such as self-driving cars and entertainment. At Apple’s 2015 shareholder meeting, one investor asked Mr. Cook about buying Tesla Inc., which today is valued around $51 billion. The CEO didn’t directly respond. Robert Nichols of Windward Capital Management Co., an Apple shareholder, says it should buy Netflix Inc., valued around $65 billion, to jumpstart its video-streaming business and bolster its position against Amazon. “You can either build [content and distribution] or you can buy it,” and buying would help Apple gain ground where it is behind, he said. With $250 billion, Apple could buy both Tesla and Netflix and still have plenty left over. It also might want to use some cash to pay down some of its debt or look to boost U.S. manufacturing after facing calls last year from then-President-elect Trump to build a plant in the U.S. Either way, there is a growing sense that Apple’s cash hoard has far outstripped its needs. “If this a rainy day fund, they’re saving for a millennial flood,” said Lee Pinkowitz, a Georgetown University professor of finance.   FOX Filed Under: Business News Featured News Gem TV’s Iranian CEO Saeed Karimian shot dead in Istanbul Turkey threatens further strikes on US-allied Syrian Kurds French election: Macron has already accomplished the unthinkable U.S.-backed militias claim big advance against IS in Syria’s Tabqa Lebanon News Speaker Berri proposed the creation of a Senate, to be headed by a Druze chairman PSP warns that sectarian electoral laws may lead to partitioning Lebanon The FPM,Hezbollah, Future, LF and PSP electoral law meeting failed , report ‘Israeli strike’ hits Hezbollah arms depot near Damascus, Syria airport- Report World News Trump: ‘One of the best chemistries I had was with’ Merkel UK snap election: What does it mean?

A few weeks ago, Roberts posted what was expected to be the final update before Apple Park's grand opening, but the campus still hasn't opened its doors to employees with just a few days left in April. Ever since Apple officially announced the name for Apple Park back in February, construction on the site has ramped up rapidly over the ensuing weeks. Today, solar panel installation on the roof of the central "Spaceship" building appears nearly complete, while the courtyard of the building is still seeing major construction related to the large pond and surrounding greenery. Landscaping everywhere on the campus has been expanding over the past few weeks, so much so that Apple has caused tree shortages for other companies in the area. In Roberts' newest video, it's evident that there is still much time left for Apple's landscaping to be finished, which will eventually end with 9,000 native and drought-resistant trees spread across the site. The continuation of landscaping, as well as construction on some of Apple Park's auxiliary buildings, will continue into the summer, well after Apple moves the first employees into the main building. While some of the side buildings are complete -- like the parking garage -- a few still have a ways to go, including the new campus auditorium, which has been named the "Steve Jobs Theater" in honor of the late CEO. Once employees begin moving in, it's estimated to take Apple around six months to move in all the workers coming to Apple Park, which will number about 13,000. Earlier in April, another well-known drone videographer, Duncan Sinfield, shared off a video of what Apple Park looks like when it's lit up at night.

This construction of Apple Park is a small fraction of Apple’s R&D budget, and even smaller percentage of Apple’s overall financial position. Engineers working on new Apple projects have little to with the construction of Apple Park. In fact Apple Park was built to facilitate better communications between engineering, marketing, R&D with a great working environment.

Investors Take Over 365 Data Centers, What’s Next? – The market continues to consolidate, and the new owners are likely to be on the look-out for more roll-up opportunities in “edge” markets. IBM Launches Four Cloud Data Centers in US – Cloud has been one of the few bright spots in the company’s overall picture of declining revenue in recent years as it struggles to adjust to the new world where enterprises are not signing nearly as many big data center hardware and services contracts as they used to, opting instead for cloud services by the likes of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Going Green in Silicon Valley is Expensive, but Not for Everyone – At least one data center provider in Silicon Valley has managed to make buying renewable energy for its campus there easier for itself. And it pulled it off by taking advantage of a window of opportunity that opened only briefly in 2010 and has since been shut. Cloud Giants Disagree on the Future of Corporate Data Centers – We heard two very different perspectives on the future of on-premise enterprise data centers from top executives on this week’s earnings calls by two of the world’s largest cloud providers.

Every organization reflects the values of its leader. A lengthy article in the New York Times last weekend makes Uber founder Travis Kalanick sound like little more than a horse’s ass. The Times puff piece apologizes for poor little rich kid Travis who was cruelly bullied as a child. The suggestion is the experience toughened him up and made him into the clear eyed genius who created the world’s most successful ride hailing business, valued today at somewhere around $70 billion. The fact that a company with an app can be worth more than General Motors or Tesla is a commentary on the bubbling, seething culture of tech startups — a culture that is lampooned brilliantly by the NetFlix series, Silicon Valley. Uber has adopted a highly combative corporate style to fend off any and all attempts by local authorities to regulate it. For years, it has employed a program known as Greyball to avoid surveillance by officials. The program identifies those suspected of being government watchdogs and sends them false or misleading information about Uber cars in their area. Often, the company software ends up cancelling a request for a ride from someone it considers suspicious. Uber says it developed the Grayball software to thwart people who might make its drivers targets of physical harm and to keep competitors from acquiring proprietary information about the company and its operations. Authorities like Ted Wheeler, the mayor of Portland, Oregon, see it differently. Wheeler says, “I am very concerned that Uber may have purposefully worked to thwart the city’s job to protect the public.” Recently, Uber has been torched by allegations that there is a culture of sexual harassment within the company. After initially denying the allegations, Kalanick later yielded to pressure and announced a top to bottom review of company personnel procedures. More recently, Uber stepped into another pile of trouble after Apple discovered it was using a process known as “fingerprinting” to monitor the phones of Uber users who had downloaded the Uber app to their smartphones even after the app was deleted and the phones were restarted. That landed Kalanick in hot water with Apple CEO Tim Cook, who invited him to a private meeting and told him to stop using the process or Apple would block the app from every iPhone in the world, according to the New York Times. Kalanick agreed to do so but has since fired back at the suggestion it did anything wrong. It says the “fingerprinting” process is a common industry practice. Mark Cuban, who is an investor in Uber, tells the New York Times, “Travis’ biggest strength is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goal.” Then Cuban adds, “Travis’ greatest weakness is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goal.” Former colleagues describe him as being “emotionally unintelligent.” He has organized staff meetings to discuss how to take down competitors, including Lyft, Uber’s biggest rival. Kalanick was filmed having a violent argument with an Uber driver earlier this year after the driver suggested the company’s compensation package was inadequate. Uber is known for cutting back on the percentage it pays its drivers. When putative president Donald Trump issued his first travel ban, taxi drivers in New York City called a one hour strike to protest the treatment of immigrants. Uber responded by sending as many drivers as possible to JFK airport, a move that earned it scorn from the public. Millions of people deleted their Uber app as a result. Last week, another storm broke over the company when it was learned that Unroll.me, a free e-mail organizing service, was selling customer data to Uber that would allow it to determine how many people were using Lyft in a given area. That sort of mania for spying on the competition is endemic at Uber. Uber’s business model is to browbeat government officials, competitors, customers, women, and its own drivers into submission as it pursues absolute dominance in the ride hailing business. Elon Musk recently referred to the new Tesla Network that’s coming soon as “the people versus Uber.” Being an overbearing, anti-social jerk may be one way to get a business off the ground, but being loathed by people how have been bludgeoned by the company’s scorched earth policies in the past may not be a good strategy for long term success.     Share: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Tags: Apple user ID, electronic fingerprinting, Greyball technology, Travis Kalanick, Uber ride hailing service About the Author Steve Hanley I have been a car nut since the days when Rob Walker and Henry N.

CNBC: TJ Fabian After returning from the trip, which was organized by NYU and China's Labor Watch, Zeng said he's convinced that U.S. workers aren't going to be shuffling into factories to build iPhones any time soon. How exactly does a student at a prestigious U.S. university end up in China, sitting quietly on a stool, inserting parts into iPhones, one by one? Zeng walked CNBC through his decision to spend six weeks in a factory working 12 hours shifts Monday through Saturday, mostly during the night, and what he discovered along the way. Dejian Zeng "I just showed up" It turns out getting into an iPhone factory isn't that hard. "They just gave me the address of the factory and I just went. I just showed up. When I was there I saw people holding luggage waiting in a long line, so I just stood in the line," Zeng told CNBC in an interview. "When it was my turn they asked for my ID, asked to see my hand and asked me to recite the English alphabet. I got in after that. It took less than 30 seconds. You don't have to apply or have any skills." Dejian Zeng Zeng told CNBC he went to the factory because China Labor Watch was expecting a strike, and it wanted boots on the ground in case a strike occurred to understand how it happened. Zeng said China Labor Watch had done research and had noticed that, while wages weren't terrible, Pegatron's factory was cutting down the subsidies it offered workers on things like food, which ultimately meant workers were getting paid less. As he phrased it, Pegatron was using a bit of a loophole to save money while also meeting wage labor requirements. Zeng also claims he saw several violations, such as mandatory overtime, which he addressed in an open letter to Apple in March. Dejian Zeng Why it can't happen here Now that he's seen how a Chinese iPhone factory operates, Zeng doesn't believe that Apple or other companies will be able to build competitive factories in the U.S., no matter what politicians want them to do. "The first thing I can think of from a labor perspective is that the wages are unacceptable for American workers. So, in the factories, I was getting paid about 3100 yuan, or $450, per month. I don't think American workers can accept those kind of wages based on living conditions and prices here," Zeng said. "Even if they relocate factories to the U.S. they'd replace workers with robots," Zeng said. He said Pegatron already uses robots to apply cameras to iPhones, and to drop batteries into the devices. Robots, Zeng said, are more precise than human workers, and precision is particularly important for those two components. Dejian Zeng The only reason human labor is still used, he believes, is because it's cheaper in some cases. "We are using labor in China instead of a machine because labor is cheaper than maintaining machines. If you relocate factories to the States you need to think of how to manage the workers," Zeng explained. Zeng never saw the strike he was there to monitor, but he believes that sort of strike could easily happen in the U.S. "We don't have labor unions in China. Unions are strong organizations in the States, and that could cause a lot of trouble with management." He added that high turnover and lack of labor leadership makes strikes unlikely in China. "The turnover rate is extremely high, people leave after 2 weeks or a month. For ordinary workers, it's very hard to have a thought that, 'hey I don't like this, we need to organize.' It needs to be middle management, a line manager, someone who holds meetings with you every day and who gives demands, and if they said during a meeting 'we need to strike tomorrow and we need to fight for wages,' I could see that. But that's not happening." Dejian Zeng Even China is getting too expensive Meanwhile, Zeng also said that factories are starting to appear in other countries where human labor costs are even cheaper than in China. "China is developing. Prices for food and housing are increasing, so you have to increase wages accordingly. The government set minimum wages, and wages are going up, so [the] cost for labor is going up. Other places like Bangladesh, the wages are really low. They're shutting down factories in China and moving to where labor costs are lower. Factories used to be in America, then they moved to China, and now they're moving over to Vietnam and Bangladesh." If President Trump wants iPhones manufactured in the U.S., Apple will need to front the cost to pay the much higher wages required in the U.S., which means that consumers will have to be willing to pay more. Either that, or it will have to rely a lot more on machines, which won't create jobs, and might end up taking them.

According to a khaleejtimes.com report, citing Arabic daily Emarat Al Youm, the UAE’s Ministry of Economy stated that only specific iPhone 6s which contain defective batteries made in China during September and October 2015 will be recalled. Apple has recently expressed that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. If you have experienced this issue, the firm has urged residents to use the serial number checker (www.apple.com/ae/support/iPhone6s-unexpectedshutdown/) if your iPhone 6s is eligible for a battery replacement, free of charge.

Posted : 2017-04-30 16:34 Updated : 2017-04-30 17:23 Customers try LG Electronics' flagship G6 smartphone at the Lotte Department Store in Seoul. The company will run G6 experience zones at 16 electronics stores until May. 7. / Yonhap By Lee Min-hyung LG Electronics is preparing for the launch of a compact version of its latest flagship G6 smartphone. This rumor is going viral after overseas media reported that the company is planning to unveil a 5.4-inch handset, tentatively named G6 Mini, equipped with the same 18:9 display ratio as the G6. Nothing specific has been confirmed over its launch, features and price. But leaked images show the new model comes with a very similar design to the latest G series _ including dual rear cameras and a circular fingerprint scanner. "We cannot confirm anything about any product that has not been launched," an LG Electronics spokesman said, Sunday. The company declined to comment further. The move is reportedly aimed at diversifying the firm's mobile product lineups with different display sizes, following the global premium handset trend led by Samsung and Apple. Apple has launched two flagship iPhone models ― based on 4.7- and 5.5-inch displays in recent years. Samsung Electronics also has two different premium lineups ― the Galaxy and Galaxy Note series ― whose key difference is also the display size. Even if LG also uses a two-track strategy by launching two models each year ― the G and V series ― the company has so far failed to leave a strong design identity in terms of display size between the two models. The LG G6, unveiled this February at this year's Mobile World Congress (MWC), comes with a 5.7-inch full-vision display which the firm says offers an optimum viewing experience. The company did not add any eye-catching selling points to the device, but the latest model has so far received the most favorable initial market response in the firm's mobile history. Last month, LG posted a record pre-order of some 80,000 here for the latest G series. LG is pinning hopes on the new device, seeking to revive its sagging mobile unit from years-long failures for its predecessors ― the G5 and G4. The launch of the G6 improved the firm's profitability by a huge margin, with its mobile unit reporting only a 200 million won ($175,000) operating loss in the first quarter. This is an outstanding performance, compared with a quarter ago when the division posted a 467 billion won operating loss. The company attributed the G6 and the firm's realignment of its business structure to the improved earnings. In the second quarter, the company said it would focus on diversifying sales channels of the G6 overseas, in a bid to increase its share in the global premium smartphone market. mhlee@ktimes.comMore articles by this reporter N.

We will recall some of the best phones throughout the years that allowed you to carry massive amounts of data - photos, videos, music and anything else. We start our story in 2005 since thats when phone storage started growing in earnest. So let us re-introduce you to the Nokia N91, which had room for as much as 8GB. That impressive number was achieved with miniaturized computer technology - a hard drive. Yep, spinning platters and moving read heads in something that was likely to be dropped on the pavement. Still, flash was much too expensive then. The worlds first 4GB microSD wouldn't be introduced until 2007! Nokia N91 2005 8GB microSD slot (up to 2GB) The next milestone came with the original Apple iPhone in 2007. It had up to 16GB storage, all of it flash (so no moving parts). The last phone with a micro HDD came out the year before, the Samsung i310. Anyway, the iPhone didnt have a microSD slot, but again, cards back then weren't all that big. Apple iPhone 2007 16GB non-expandable Nokia reclaimed the crown in 2008 with the Nokia N97. It offered 32GB of built-in flash storage, plus up to 16GB more on a microSD card. That same year SanDisk introduced the first microSD of that capacity. Nokia N97 2008 32GB microSD slot (up to 32GB) Then, after a couple of years of being stuck at 32GB, the Finns introduced the Nokia N9, the wonderful MeeGo phone with 64GB storage. A few months later Apple matched them with the iPhone 4s. Neither phone had a microSD slot. That was in 2011 and by then, the diminutive cards had grown to substantial size - 64GB (this time thanks to Knigmax). Nokia N9 2011 64GB non-expandable Then in 2013 Meizu promised 128GB storage on the Meizu MX3, but other than that we were in another storage ice age. Meizu MX3 2013 128GB non-expandable The next increase came in 2015 with the Asus Zenfone 2 Deluxe ZE551ML, the Special edition of which had as much as 256GB of built-in storage. You could double that with a microSD card... not that you could find such a card, as that year SanDisk only managed to fit 200GB on a microSD. 256GB cards showed up eventually, but things have been quiet since - 512GB microSD cards are only demoed, never sold. Asus Zenfone 2 Deluxe ZE551ML 2015 256GB microSD slot (up to 256GB) A few other phones matched the 256GB offer in 2016, but most devices these days dont go north of 128GB. And we think the first 512GB phone isnt coming soon - in recent years, makers have taken to promoting storage speed rather than capacity. Also, vendors try to push cloud storage solutions as an alternative (some going too far). Even the microSD format was bitten by the speed bug - Class A1 cards should offer the kind of performance needed to run apps from external storage. That is an answer to UFS cards, which promise much higher speeds. In the beginning, phones had no storage of their own - they kept the phonebook and SMS inbox on the SIM card. Weve certainly come a long way since (with odd detours like Multimedia SIM cards, which combined telephony and storage).

How can you be angry on a phone that had the best chipset until 835 went out? Reply Hephaestus8 tueZ 5 hours ago Now, we have e-sims and cloud storage. All that sim card and sd card will be useless. Our grandchildren will laugh at the days people still using 'cards'.

Digital Trends Home > Home Theater > Meet MHL, the easiest link from your phone to your… Meet MHL, the easiest link from your phone to your TV By Rick Stella — April 28, 2017 5:20 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Thanks to Google’s Chromecast and a host of other options, wireless streaming from your phone to your TV has never been easier. However, if you’re looking for something a bit more reliable — and with a few more options — you may want to utilize a little known technology called MHL. Using an MHL connection to wire your phone directly to your display via HDMI may not be as convenient as wireless streaming, but for a variety of reasons, it’s an enticing option. The thing is, many people are unaware the technology even exists. For those looking to figure out what those three little letters on your TV or A/V receiver’s HDMI input actually do, we’re here to lay it out for you. The following covers all the basics of MHL so you can take full advantage of the technology and its capabilities. Now let’s get to sending all the coolest stuff on your phone to your TV — the old fashioned way. What is MHL? In 2010, a band of electronics companies, including Sony and Nokia, developed the MHL connection protocol. Short for Mobile High-Definition Link, MHL utilizes a specially equipped HDMI input on compatible TVs and A/V receivers to connect a growing list of smartphones, tablets, and other devices. The standard takes smartphone and tablet content to the next level, allowing you to showcase everything from your phone on your TV with a single connection. How do I use MHL? The most common way to connect for most people is to use an MHL adapter such as the one shown below, which consists of a male Micro USB plug on one end and a female HDMI port on the other. If your phone hosts a Micro USB port, all you need to do is simply connect an MHL adaptor to your phone, and run an HDMI cable from the adaptor to the MHL-enabled HDMI port on your television (the correct port will be labeled “MHL”) and you’re all set. If your phone or tablet does not host a Micro USB port, you’ll also need another adapter, which we’ll discuss in more detail in the next section below. A typical MHL adapter. When MHL first launched, adapters like the one shown above were more or less the primary way to utilize the technology. Now, though, there are lots of different cables that support MHL, including direct Micro USB-to-HDMI cables. The next step is simply plugging in your compatible device, which will allow you to display all of its applications, games, movies, photos, and music right on your TV, with resolution at 4K Ultra HD (and above). Does my device work with MHL? KPG_Payless / Shutterstock.com If you’re thinking about looking into MHL, you should make sure your device and display are compatible with the protocol by checking the official MHL site — found here — for a full list of supported devices. If your display device isn’t on the list, don’t bother buying an MHL adapter — it’s not going to work. If your display device is on the list, but your mobile device isn’t, there are also some other ways to connect. If you’re an Apple enthusiast, your iPhone or iPad does not have the correct output for the default MHL adapter or cable described above. Luckily, there are workarounds for iFans; any device with a Lightning port (most newer iOS products have them) can be used with one of the adapters found here. You can then connect to an MHL adapter, such as the one pictured above, or an MHL to HDMI cable. Some newer Android phones have USB Type-C ports, rather than Micro USB; they’ll need third-party adapters to work with MHL as well. In the same vein, most compatible Samsung phones require a different (eleven-pin) adapter, as the default (five-pin) adapter won’t properly interface. Just like with Apple products, there are also third-party direct connectors for these devices. However, be aware that these won’t charge your phone like standard MHL. Why use MHL? Great question! As mentioned, there are several wireless methods that work for mirroring mobile devices to bigger screens; Apple’s AirPlay for iPhones and iPads, for example, or Miracast for Android devices. And of course, Google’s Chromecast lets you stream video and audio from multiple apps. These methods don’t always offer the same level of video and sound quality as MHL, but the wireless connection is more convenient for many applications. However, there are many use cases where MHL could come in handy. The system is especially useful for those without cable or internet, for instance. In such a case, MHL essentially turns your phone and TV into a full-blown entertainment center, no Wi-Fi required. In addition, there are a few protocol-specific benefits that might make it worth going with MHL. First, MHL connections tout the convenient ability to transmit control data, which essentially means the remote that controls your television may also be able to control the connected device. For mobile gamers, MHL connection also offers zero latency, which allows for lag-free display of your device on your TV during the most rigorous of gaming sessions. The cable also charges mobile devices up to 40W without any subsequent lag while displaying the content. Where else can I use MHL? As we’re sure you’ve surmised by this point, MHL’s most useful function is to send data from a smartphone or tablet to a compatible TV or A/V receiver lag-free. However, MHL also lets you plug your smartphone or tablet into a car’s compatible infotainment system, as well as a compatible computer monitor at home or at work. By plugging a phone or tablet into a compatible car hookup, you’ll have the ability to utilize up-to-the-second traffic reports, charge your device while commuting, and access your personal music library. The system gives easy touchscreen access to all content on your phone right through the infotainment center. Likewise, plugging a smartphone or tablet into a compatible computer monitor can turn your device into a work station, one you can pair with a Bluetooth keyboard or mouse to create a (semi) fully-functioning mini office. How much does MHL cost? Another reason MHL is a viable choice is the fact that an adapter won’t cost you an arm and a leg. Adapters can run as little as $9 (or less), though you’ll still need a long HDMI cable such as this one from Monoprice, which runs another $12-13 or so. Depending upon the adapters or cables you need, getting set up with MHL can cost anywhere from $10 to $40, which is pretty affordable any way you slice it. So there you go. Now you’re ready to get down and dirty with MHL. Time to start streaming to that TV, latency-free!

She had provided these as testimony in the Santa Clara court where her domestic violence case was being heard in March 2017. In one of the clips, he says he would like to stab her multiple times. I could hear their three-year-old daughter’s distressed voice in the background. I have listened to stories of domestic violence before and seen the emotional and physical bruises the women victims bear. Each time, it’s distressing.  This time it was more so because I was hearing the woman’s pleading voice, the words of abuse and the sound of thwacking in real time. Neha Rastogi, a technically qualified NRI ,living in Silicon Valley recorded these audio clips on her iPhone over a period of time. For ten years, she had suffered being beaten and verbally abused by her husband Abhishek Ghattani, the CEO and co-founder of the Silicon Valley startup Cuberon.  One of the recordings is of a beating which she received while they were having a technical discussion about fixing a bug. He uses abusive language on her all through and thrashes her till she says what he wants her to say. “What is a bug?” he asks. “Come on, bi**h! What is a bug?” He beats her without even letting her answer. There is no disputing it.  Domestic violence is all pervasive.  It knows no boundaries of education, location, economic stability or any of the other usual parameters we use for explaining violence of this nature. UN Women highlighted the nature of domestic violence with this ad campaign that made use of real Google search queries Neha grew up in India, married a man picked for her by her parents and migrated to the US ten years ago.  She had a good job at Apple and worked with exciting new products like FaceTime and Maps. She had also worked for companies like Adobe and Cisco. Abhishek also had a good career before he co-founded his own startup. Neha and Abhishek have a three-and-a-half year old daughter. On the face of it, they had the ideal life which would be aspirational for most middle class Indian families.  The rot within remained hidden because like all good Indian women, Neha had been brainwashed into believing a marriage like hers was worth holding on to. Even though the abuse began very shortly after she was married, she hung on and even had a baby. Abhishek was arrested for the first time three years ago when a mailman saw him beating his wife on the sidewalk in front of his house. Their baby was just three months old then. Neha actually went and bailed her husband out and got his sentence reduced because she wanted to save the marriage for the sake of their baby.  She says she honestly believed then that he would reform. It was only when she realised that nothing would change him that she started meticulously and secretly recording the abuse which often took place in front of their child. She was slapped when she was breast feeding her daughter, kicked violently in the stomach, made to stand all night at the foot of his bed when she was eight months pregnant... the list of horrors goes on. She was even forced to give up her job at Apple because of his threats and violence. In July 2016, after a particularly violent round of abuse, she went back to the same police station and filed a complaint with all the audio and video evidence she had collected. But the odds were against her. The Silicon Valley justice system was anxious to prevent the deportation of Abhishek given the present political climate. So, although he faced felony assault and domestic violence charges he reached an agreement with the prosecution and pleaded no-contest to the lesser charges of “felony accessory after the fact” and the misdemeanour of “offensive touching” which invited less than half of a 30-day sentence. The case has been rescheduled for one more hearing after Neha read out her powerful victim-impact statement in court. “Offensive touching!" she exclaimed," Please explain to me is it offensive touching when a 8-month pregnant woman is beaten and then forced to stand for the entire night by her husband, is it offensive touching when a mother nursing her 6-day-old child is slapped on her face by her husband because he thinks she is not latching properly with the child, is it offensive touching when a women is flung to the floor and repetitively kicked in her belly, is it offensive touching when a woman is slapped nine times by her husband until she agrees to everything he is saying and then gets hit again for not agreeing with it sooner?” The Rastogi-Gattani case has garnered so many eyeballs because the players are well educated achievers. For the uninitiated, it is hard to believe patriarchy is really alive and flourishing even in sunny California — the Mecca of middle class India’s dreams. It is harder to accept that an educated career woman put up with this sort of abuse for 10 years. But, it happens all the time around us. The social stigma gets diluted and the perpetrators are forgiven when they are wealthy or are professional achievers.  Domestic violence and misogyny become almost acceptable forms of behaviour when they are coated with a veneer of sugar …  “it was job stress”, or “the poor guy had money problems and she splurged” or she was “disobedient” or “impertinent” or the ultimate  justification — “after all he is a man”. Mani Rathnam's latest film Kaatru Veliyidai, for instance, romanticises misogyny so beautifully. A handsome fighter pilot trained to kill has an affair with a beautiful young doctor who is head over heels in love with him. Under the spell of the fantastic photography and fabulous music, one almost begins to think that the obsessive love affair between the misogynistic hero and the beautiful and sensitive heroine is actually romantic. Why else would she keep returning to him? And the “happy” ending somehow patched together in a convoluted manner reemphasises the message that callous and insensitive behaviour can win a woman’s heart and keep her in a relationship forever. But in real life, misogynists seldom change. The romance quickly sours and the victim wants to escape. Different kinds of violence can exist within a relationship... physical, emotional sexual. In such cases, consent and zero tolerance have no meaning. There are many areas of grey which are impossible for an outsider to fathom. The interpersonal lines are so twisted and entwined that after a while, escape becomes a dream. Add to this the extra sauce of social opprobrium which we get in our society… “What will the neighbors and relatives say?” “Who will marry your sister now?” “Your duty is to put up with him and adjust.” “Who will look after you if you walk out?” “Your children need a father.”  Walking out therefore is not easy. The reach of domestic violence is wide and all-encompassing especially in India where most people find it difficult to accept that it can take many forms. Physical violence is the most obvious, even though often women hide their bruises or pretend they had accidents in order to protect their husbands. Emotional violence is harder to prove. As for sexual violence, forget it! Indian law does not even recognise marital rape as a crime. Yet women stay in bad marriages — often because they have nowhere else to go.  Even if the husband is a bigamist or is having an extramarital affair, they turn a blind eye because putting him behind bars would not serve any purpose. Some years ago, I visited safe houses for Indian women in the UK, Canada and USA. Their problems were of a different order. Many of the women I spoke to didn’t even know the language of the country in which they lived.  They had been married off to men they had never met and brought directly from their small towns to an alien country. One woman told me she had sneaked out of the car while her abusive husband was filling gas and had hidden for two days till she spotted an Indian couple who had brought her to this safe house. But she still lived in terror as she had no papers.  Everything was with her husband. I also met educated women who were working professionals in India but had ended up as brutalised wives without any papers in these safe houses. As a beautiful young software engineer with a big bruise on her face told me, “At least in India I could have walked out and found myself a job. Here, even my education and professional experience is a waste because I am a visa wife.” A woman can be subjected to violence over a variety of “misdeeds” … not cooking tasty food, not controlling the children, being too beautiful, being too plain, being an achiever in her professional life, daring to have a mind of her own, not handing over her salary, being 'dumb'…  and most importantly not bringing enough dowry from her parental home.  Just one visit to the burns ward at any hospital in any town will give you an idea of how many women have their lives snuffed out or permanently impaired because they didn’t bring enough dowry. Women who opt out of a relationship which is turning toxic are also in danger because they can be stalked, attacked with acid or even killed in broad daylight. Domestic violence is a dark and secret activity. Abused partners are subjected to a form of manipulation known as gas lighting.  The perpetrator plays with his victim’s mind, making her question her own memory, perception, and even sanity. No wonder women stay trapped in such relationships until they reach breaking point. #Abhishek gattani#Domestic violence#Fweekend#Neha rastogi#Nri#Physical abuse#Sexual abuse#Techie#Violence against women#Visa wives#Women's empowerment#Women's rights Published Date: Apr 30, 2017 11:44 am | Updated Date: Apr 30, 2017 12:04 pm Also See Women and the workplace: Here's how we can help colleagues who are victims of abuse Dev DD: An unimaginative portrayal of an empowered female protagonist by ALTBalaji Eight-year-old girl raped, murdered by close relative in Maharashtra village; accused held T20 LEAGUE SCHEDULE Match Date Details 1 May 1 MI Vs RCB 2 May 1 RPS Vs GL 3 May 2 DD Vs SRH 4 May 3 KKR Vs RPS 5 May 4 DD Vs GL Full Schedule Top Stories That Vinod Khanna photograph: Obituary on the death of Human Decency and Privacy Rs 600 Cr Per Kilometre: Govt Plans Tunnel Project to Decongest Bengaluru IPL 2017: Sandeep Sharma returns to dismantle Delhi Daredevils as Kings XI Punjab bowlers finally deliver Hindi debate: Union Minister Nirmala Sitharaman rejects DMK's charge of language imposition Multiple credit cards can knock down your credit score — use them well RERA myths busted: No big relief for stuck home buyers, house prices won't rise Turkey president Erdogan urges multilateral approach to Jammu and Kashmir; backs India, Pakistan for NSG Left-led Kerala govt will be first in country to provide insurance, free medical treatment for migrant workers Cricket Scores Current & Recent Upcoming Indian Premier League, 2017 HYD Vs KOL Sunrisers Hyderabad beat Kolkata Knight Riders by 48 runs Pakistan in West Indies, 3 Test Series, 2017 WI Vs PAK Live Now Indian Premier League, 2017 PUN Vs DEL Kings XI Punjab beat Delhi Daredevils by 10 wickets Indian Premier League, 2017 GUJ Vs MUM Gujarat Lions tied with Mumbai Indians (Mumbai Indians win Super Over by 5 runs) Indian Premier League, 2017 PNE Vs BLR Rising Pune Supergiant beat Royal Challengers Bangalore by 61 runs Indian Premier League, 2017 PUN Vs HYD Sunrisers Hyderabad beat Kings XI Punjab by 26 runs Indian Premier League, 2017 KOL Vs DEL Kolkata Knight Riders beat Delhi Daredevils by 7 wickets Indian Premier League, 2017 BLR Vs GUJ Gujarat Lions beat Royal Challengers Bangalore by 7 wickets Indian Premier League, 2017 PNE Vs KOL Kolkata Knight Riders beat Rising Pune Supergiant by 7 wickets Indian Premier League, 2017 BLR Vs HYD Match Abandoned Indian Premier League, 2017 MUM vs BLR - May 1st, 2017, 04:00 PM IST Indian Premier League, 2017 PNE vs GUJ - May 1st, 2017, 08:00 PM IST Indian Premier League, 2017 DEL vs HYD - May 2nd, 2017, 08:00 PM IST Indian Premier League, 2017 KOL vs PNE - May 3rd, 2017, 08:00 PM IST Indian Premier League, 2017 DEL vs GUJ - May 4th, 2017, 08:00 PM IST Ireland in England, 2 ODI Series, 2017 ENG vs IRE - May 5th, 2017, 03:30 PM IST Indian Premier League, 2017 BLR vs PUN - May 5th, 2017, 08:00 PM IST Indian Premier League, 2017 HYD vs PNE - May 6th, 2017, 04:00 PM IST Indian Premier League, 2017 DEL vs MUM - May 6th, 2017, 08:00 PM IST Ireland in England, 2 ODI Series, 2017 ENG vs IRE - May 7th, 2017, 03:30 PM IST Site Index हिंदी फर्स्टपोस्ट About Firstpost Newsletter RSS Twitter Facebook Sections Front Page Politics Sports India World Business Life Entertainment Photos Videos Plus India Open 2017 New Delhi Mumbai Photos Videos FP Exclusives Cartoons Video Room eBooks Weather Others Sample Papers Online Business Technology News MTV India Online Shopping in India Delhi MCD Elections 2017 Results - Live Counting Delhi MCD Elections 2017 South Delhi MCD Election Ward List 2017 North Delhi MCD Election Ward List 2017 East Delhi MCD Election Ward List 2017 IPL 2017 E-Learning Franchise Opportunity Tools RSS Feeds Apps iOS Android Copyright © 2017.

Apple said it had decided to withhold royalty payments to its contract manufacturers until the dispute is resolved in court. The payments made by Apple to its contract manufacturers are, in turn, owed by the contractors to Qualcomm in royalties, according to the chipmaker’s licensing business model. The iPhone maker sued Qualcomm in January, accusing it of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips used in smartphones, is a major supplier to Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for modem chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm’s revenue in its latest fiscal year. “Without an agreed-upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court,” an Apple spokesman said on Friday. Apple also noted it had been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years, but said Qualcomm had refused to negotiate “fair terms”. “Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade,” Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel, said in a statement. Qualcomm said it will not receive royalties from Apple’s contract manufacturers for sales during the quarter ended March 31, and that its forecast for the third fiscal quarter now excludes that revenue. “Even if one believed this was a worst case scenario (for Qualcomm), we struggle to see a resolution anytime soon as the parties entrench,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said. “We suspect this is going to continue to get uglier,” he added. Qualcomm now expects revenue of $4.8 billion-$5.6 billion for its third fiscal quarter, down from the $5.3 billion-$6.1 billion it had previously expected. The company lowered its forecast for current-quarter adjusted profit to 75-85 cents per share, from 90 cents-$1.15 per share. “(Apple’s) contract manufacturers may make some form of partial payment, but initial indications are that any payment would likely be insignificant,” Qualcomm said. Through Thursday, Qualcomm’s shares had fallen 17 percent since Apple’s lawsuit. The stock — the worst performer this year on the Philadelphia semiconductor index — was down 0.7 percent at $52.86 in midday trading.

Two employees of nightlife-rating app Bartrendr claim they were ordered to be pretend partygoers and post constantly in order to make the app seem popular. The now-defunct app encouraged users to post comments on beers and bar scenes in real time. The California bosses were so desperate to drum up business that they ordered workers to adopt “multiple pseudonyms or personas in order to give the application the appearance of more user interaction,” according to a lawsuit filed by Staci Spector, 47, and Lisa Garcia, 46. They often worked more than 80 hours a week but were only paid $1,500 a month, they claim. Spector and Garcia were fired in May 2015 after complaining, they charge in a wrongful-termination suit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court. Social Standards, the company behind the app, didn’t respond to a message.

Join For Free Discover how to focus on operators for Reactive Programming and how they are essential to react to data in your application.  Brought to you in partnership with Wakanda.  You catch the latest TestFlight news just now? This looks pretty interesting: Well doesn’t that just sort a whole lot of issues we routinely run into, am I right? Sure we can play games with app IDs and icon tagging and whatever, not even going to bother linking to our various posts on tips and tricks for that kind of thing, but this looks waaay easier. Mind you, we haven’t actually distributed an app using Apple’s incarnation of TestFlight yet- next one’ll be the first. When they first acquired it the "no iOS 7" thing was a flat out dealbreaker, and by the time that wasn’t well we’d settled into a Crashlytics-centered flow nicely so eh, whatever dudes. The first time it crossed our mind that, "hmmm...maybe we could rethink that," was this post last fall: How Not to Crash #1. Interestingly, these crashes did not appear in our usual crash reporting service, HockeyApp, so it actually took us a while to realize that we had a problem. To be aware of all crashes, developers need to check for crash reports through iTunes Connect, or Xcode too… Well, if we have to check them there, why bother checking other places too? Always like to streamline our process, being awesome DevOps dudes and all. But that wasn’t enough to seriously consider going all in, until a few weeks ago Google gobbled as Google gobbles and we were a tad miffed, you might recall. Clearly this is great if you’ve already bought into the Firebase platform, but if you haven’t, there’s a bit of thinking to do now, especially for those of us in businesses that Google actively competes with, so we have a smidgen of trepidation about handing over our collective user profiles and activity. Paranoid, yes yes, but hey- paranoids have enemies too. So that was enough to prod us into actively researching alternatives. In our considered opinion Bugsee is the best out there right now by a spectacular margin, oooh network logs would rock! But oh, come on dudes, we’re an indie place here (OK, actually these days we’re DevOps at Agoda.com because Bangkok!) You actually think we can pay? Heh, that’s cute. And yes yes, Dear Reader, your favorite is very nice too, but nothing else really struck us as worth the effort to switch to. But this. This here, this actively solves recurring problems! And far as we’re aware — please correct us if we’re wrong — the only actual downside from a dev perspective remaining with TestFlight is that users can opt out of reporting, and then no doubt those that choose to are the exact ones that would get that one weird crash we’d get grumpies 1-starring us with no way to figure out WTF they’re going on about, which would be … suboptimal. But, oh wait, that problem’s sorted now too, so … what’s left as a practical objection to going all in on TestFlight for your iOS platform needs? Why, nothing we can see! If there’s anything we’ve still overlooked, please comment, but at first glance, our verdict is "yep, next project, no Google libs, all in Apple." We’ll update here if any flaws arise in that cunning plan! Learn how divergent branches can appear in your repository and how to better understand why they are called “branches".  Brought to you in partnership with Wakanda.  Like This Article?

Unofficially, the night's festivities have been called many things, including "the party of the year,""the Oscars of the East Coast" (mostly because of the star quotient and the elaborate red carpet, in which guests pose on the grand entrance stairs to the museum) and, somewhat pointedly, "an ATM for the Met," the last by publicist Paul Wilmot. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Rita Ora in silver feathers at the Met Gala. Photo: Larry Busacca The party signals the opening of the Costume Institute's annual blockbuster show, and it is known for its celebrity and fashion hosts. This year, the exhibition is Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garcons: Art of the In-Between, and the hosts are Anna Wintour (the Wizard of Oz for this particular event), Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchen, Katy Perry and Pharrell Williams; honourary chairwomen are Kawakubo and Caroline Kennedy, the former U.S. ambassador to Japan. Q: Why is it called the party of the year? Related Content In praise of Brigitte Trogneux's sexy non 'French woman' style 'Dissent is not enough': Vogue's Anna Wintour on Trump A: Wintour, editor of American Vogue and artistic director of Conde Nast, took over as chairwoman of the gala in 1999. Since then, she has been instrumental in transforming a local philanthropic event into the ultimate global celebrity/power cocktail: Take a jigger of famous names from fashion, add film, politics and business, and mix. It's such a heady combo that President Donald Trump proposed to his wife, Melania, during the gala in 2004. (In case you are wondering: No, they are not expected this year.) It is among the hardest party tickets of the year to get - and thus, intensely coveted. Q: What's so important about Rei Kawakubo? Who is she? Advertisement A: Kawakubo is a 74-year-old Japanese designer who founded her label, Comme des Garcons, in 1969, and she will be only the second living designer to be given a solo show at the Met. (The first was Yves Saint Laurent in 1983.) She routinely ends up on every list of "most influential designers of the 20th century"-  and, now, the 21st-  in large part because she refuses to accept any of the rules that govern normal clothing design: that clothes need to be flattering, for example, or that they need to have armholes. Instead, she is interested in challenging our ideas about what defines beauty, identity and gender. She goes where most other designers fear to tread, which is to say, into the realm of clothes that look really, really weird. (Once, when describing a collection, she said she was trying "not to make clothes.") But she may also finally put to rest the question: Is fashion art? Besides, know this: She also runs a multimillion-dollar international business full of lots of wearable stuff and collaborates regularly with Nike and Speedo.

A: Tickets this year are about $40, 000 apiece, and tables are about $367, 000. The party and exhibition are sponsored, so all of the money from ticket sales goes to the Costume Institute. Last year, about $13.5 million was raised. In past years, there was one main corporate underwriter per show, alongside Wintour's employer, Conde Nast. Last year it was Apple, but this year the burden is being divided among Apple, Conde Nast, Farfetch, H&M and Maison Valentino.

Photo gallery The top 10 stand-outs moments from the Met Gala through the years A: Dream on. Unlike other cultural fundraisers, like the New York City Ballet gala or the Frick Collection Young Fellows Ball, the Met gala is invitation-only, and there is a waiting list to get on the list. Qualifications for inclusion have to do with buzz and achievement (and beauty) more than money. Wintour has final say over every invitation and attendee, which means that even if a company buys a table, it cannot choose everyone who sits at its table: It must clear the guest with her and Vogue.

This can backfire. In 2015, the exhibition was China: Through the Looking Glass, and it created some politically incorrect moments when celebrities and the designers who dressed them got their Asian references muddled. (Lady Gaga, for example, wore a Balenciaga kimonolike look, which seemed to lean toward the Japanese; ditto Georgia May Jagger in Gucci.) Last year, the show was Manus ex Machina, which meant everyone started thinking silver and circuitry. Almost the entire Jenner-Kardashian clan was in sparkling Balmain motherboards. Zayn Malik looked like a Versace version of the Tin Man. All of that may pale, however, compared with what we will see this year. Why? Because, in honor of Kawakubo's own desire to push boundaries ??? this has resulted in dresses that sprouted lumps and bumps on odd parts off the body, dresses that turned women into flat-packed paper dolls and dresses that turned wedding dresses into cages ??? guests are being encouraged to think "avant-garde." Just ruminate on that for a moment.

Kawakubo herself almost always wears a long pleated skirt, white shirt and leather motorcycle jacket. It's unclear if even this black-tie event will be any different. Q: What happens when guests get inside? SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Link Taylor Swift at the 2016 Met Gala.  A: It's a secret! For the past two years, posting on social media has been banned after the red carpet. What I can tell you is this: There is a receiving line inside with the hosts, and guests have to file by and air-kiss them. Then they tour the exhibition on their way to the cocktail party, so they are at least theoretically forced to see the culture. After cocktails, they are called in to dinner, and there is always some form of entertainment. (Last year, it was Rihanna.) This is good, because as the red carpet part of the evening has become a giant marketing event ??? live streamed on a variety of sites and shown on E!, just like the Oscars ??? the fact that the main part of the event is private allows guests to relax and have fun. Or so they tell me.

Image: Supplied Australian cross-border payment startup Airwallex has secured US$13 million ($17.4 million) in a funding round to continue its expansion overseas. Some of the biggest names in global commerce invested in the round, including card issuer Mastercard, tech venture capital firm Sequoia Capital China and Chinese web giant Tencent Holdings. For Sequoia — the 45-year-old firm famous for investing in famous tech brands such as Apple, Google and AirBnB – the deal represents its Chinese arm’s first investment in an Australian startup. “Foreign exchange transactions pose a real challenge for businesses that operate across borders, and Airwallex’s solution has seriously impressed us in its ability to close the gap and allow companies to financially access markets that may have previously been out of reach,” said Sequoia partner Steven Ji. Airwallex is in the enviable position of having access to a licence in China to conduct international transactions, a privilege that many massive multinationals such as Western Union have not been able to secure. Airwallex founder and chief executive Jack Zhang told Business Insider that the company, which already can make payments to 100 countries, will use the cash injection to expand its physical presence in locations such as London, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and Taiwan. “There’s still a lot of improvement we can do to make our product easier to adopt – that’s probably 30% of the money will be used for. The other 70% will be used for market expansion into other countries, especially Europe and Singapore.” FinTech Australia chief executive Danielle Szetho hailed the funding as yet another international endorsement of the local fintech scene. “This announcement is further evidence that Australian fintech companies are regarded as truly world class by top global investors, and of our industry’s increasingly strong links with Asia and China,” she said. The startup also scored $4 million in July last year, in what it calls a “pre-series A” round from Gobi Partners, the investment manager of Chinese ecommerce conglomerate Alibaba, and a group of angel investors. The product at the time was in beta testing, but went live later in the year and the online portal half of the business now has more than 1,000 customers. The other half is an application programming interface, which allows different software to exchange information, that’s used by large corporate clients to facilitate international transfers. Zhang, a former ANZ and NAB foreign exchange solution designer, said last year that foreign exchange was one area of fintech that had not been disrupted because it was such a complicated area involving an enormous amount of regulation. “Armed with a growing number of financial services licences and partnerships across numerous jurisdictions, we aim to make international payments as cheap and simple as domestic payments,” he now said.

The worlds largest maker of electronic products for international brands said in a statement that it was studying a major expansion in the US. Foxconn Technology Group thanked the White Houses Office of American Innovation, created by President Donald Trump and directed by Jared Kushner, for its efforts to pave the way for the companys negotiations with the US government. This statement follows a two-day visit by Foxconn President Terry Gou to the White House. On Friday, Gou told the media that Hon Hai planned to make a capital intensive investment in the US market. We are planning a series of investments in America. This project will include capital intensive investment and skilled labor and high technology, Gou said. Media in Taiwan say Gou, accompanied by a delegation including Foxconn vice president Tai Jeng-wu, who is also president of Japans Sharp Corp. in which Foxconn has a two-thirds share, visited the White House and met with Trump. In late January, Foxconn said that if its customers like Apple cooperate, it could make investments in the US worth more than $7 billion. The Taiwanese company has manufacturing facilities in China with more than 1 million employees.   Enter your email address to subscribe to free headlines (and great cartoons so every email has a happy ending!) from the Latin American Herald Tribune:   RSS Feed [ Home ] [ About Us ] [ Who's Who ] [ Contacts ] [ Help ] Copyright Latin American Herald Tribune - 2005-2015 © All rights reserved

This is Part 3 of a four-part article, published in the March/April 2017 special “Costs of Empire” issue of Dollars & Sense magazine. Parts 1 and 2 are available here and here, respectively.Cross posted from Triple Crisis Structures of Global Production and Trade It is often argued that the rise of new powers—especially China, but also India, Brazil and others—means that the concept of “imperialism” is no longer valid. Yet the imperialist phase of capitalism has always been characterised by the emergence of “new kids on the block,” some of which have gone on to become neighborhood bullies. At the time when Lenin wrote his famous pamphlet Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism, a century ago, the emergence of the United States as the dominant global power was far from evident. Lenin’s claim that, during the imperialist phase of capitalism, “the territorial division of the whole world among the biggest capitalist powers is completed” is the weakest link in his argument, and one which was belied almost immediately. The United States, which was then only a minor player compared to the major European powers, emerged to dominate the world scene from the second half of the 20th century on. The rise of Japan in the second half of the 20th century by no means signified a weakening of imperialist power generally; it merely necessitated a more complicated assessment of such power. The recent emergence of China is being interpreted as a sign that the global economic landscape is completely transformed. It is true that the growing weight of China in world trade and investment has had major effects: China has become the biggest source of manufactured-goods imports for most countries, changed the terms of trade and volume of exports for many primary-product (agricultural and mineral raw materials) producing countries, and brought more countries into manufacturing value chains. It is true, also, that Chinese capital has become a significant player in the ongoing struggle for control over economic territory across the world. Yet there are dangers of exaggerating its current significance. Even now, China accounts for less than 9% of global output (constant 2005 U.S. dollars, nominal exchange rates); its per capita GDP is less than half (around 45%) of the global average, and still just fraction of the average for the economies of the imperialist core. In relative terms, China remains a “poor” country. Many of the hyperbolic mainstream analyses and predictions with respect to China are eerily similar to the predictions for Japan in the 1970s, as an emerging giant soon to take over the role of global economic leadership from the United States. A similar point can be made even more forcefully for other nations that have been ecstatically described as “emerging economies,” supposedly proving that forces of imperialism are no hindrance to the rise of developing countries. Taken together, however, the “BRICS” nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) account for less than 15% of world GDP, even though their share of global population is just under 50%. Announcing these countries as new global powers is very premature, especially when global institutional structures are still very much tilted in favor of the established powers. All this does not mean that there have been no changes in global economic and political power: there have been and will continue to be significant and even transformative changes. However, these changes in the relative positions of different countries on the economic and geopolitical ladder do not mean that the basic imperialistic tendencies that drive the global system have disappeared—indeed, they may even become more intense as the struggle for economic territory becomes more acute. This is particularly evident in the global spread of multinational corporations and their new methods of functioning, particularly with the geographic disintegration of production. Technological changes—advances in shipping and container technology that dramatically reduced transport times and costs, as well as the information technology revolution that enabled the breakdown of production into specific tasks that could be geographically separated—have been critical to this process. Together, they made possible the emergence of global value chains, which are typically dominated by large multinational corporations, but involve networks of both competing and cooperating firms. The giant corporations are not necessarily in direct control of all operations. Indeed, the ability to transfer direct control over production—as well as the associated risks—to lower ends of the value chain is an important element in increasing their profitability. This adds a greater intensity to the exploitation that can be unleashed by such global firms, because they are less dependent upon workers and resources in any one location, can use competition between suppliers to push down their prices and conditions of production, and are less burdened by national regulations that might reduce their market power. Smiling Curve of Exchange Values and Profits This transformation has therefore given rise to what has been called the “Smiling Curve” of exchange values and profits. Value added and profits are concentrated in the pre-production (such as product design) and post-production (marketing and branding) phases of a value chain. These now provide immense economic rents to the global corporations that dominate them, due to the intellectual property monopolies these corporations enjoy. The case of Apple phones is now well known: the actual producers in China (both companies and workers) earn only about one-tenth of the final price of the good; the rest is taken by Apple for product design, marketing, and distribution. The producers of coffee beans across the developing world earn a tiny percentage of the price of coffee, in contrast to the high profits of a multinational chain like Starbucks. Small farmers and laborers growing cocoa beans earn next to nothing, compared to the leading sellers of chocolate, all of which are Northern companies. The economic rents associated with the pre- and post-production phases have been growing in recent years. Meanwhile, the production phase, from which workers and small producers mainly derive their incomes, is exposed to cutthroat competition between different production sites across the world, thanks to trade and investment liberalization. Therefore, incomes generated in this stage of the value chain are kept low. The overall result is twofold. First, this has resulted in an increase in the supply of the “global” labor force (workers and small producers who are directly engaged in production of goods and services). Second, the power of corporations to capture rents—from control of knowledge, from oligopolistic/monopolistic market structures, or from the power of finance capital over state policy—has greatly increased. Overall, this has meant a dramatic increase in the bargaining power of capital relative to labor, which in turn has resulted in declining wage shares (as a percentage of national income) in both developed and developing countries. Implications for Workers These processes imply worsening material conditions, for most workers, in both the periphery and the core. Imperialism has generally weakened the capacity for autonomous development in the global South, and worsened economic conditions for workers and small producers there, so that is not altogether surprising. The growth of employment and wages in China is as a break from that pattern and an example of some benefits of global integration, at least for a subset of working people in the developing world. The beneficiaries, however, remain a minority of the workers in the global South. In other countries generally seen as “success stories” of globalization, like India, the economic realities for most people are much bleaker. The more obvious—and potent—change that has resulted from this phase of global imperialism has been the decline of the labor aristocracy in the North. The opening of trade, and with it a global supply of labor, meant that imperialist-country capital was no longer as interested in maintaining a social contract with workers in the “home” country. Instead, it could use its greater bargaining power to push for ever-greater shares of national income everywhere it operated. This was further intensified by the greater power of mobile finance capital, which was also able to increase its share of income as well. In the advanced economies at the core of global capitalism, this process (which began in the United States in the 1990s) was greatly intensified during the global boom of the 2000s, when median workers’ wages stagnated and even declined in the global North, even as per capita incomes soared. The increase in incomes, therefore, was captured by stockholders, corporate executives, financial rentiers, etc. The political fallout of this has now become glaringly evident. Increasing inequality, stagnant real incomes of working people, and the increasing material fragility of daily life have all contributed to a deep dissatisfaction among ordinary people in the rich countries. While even the poor among them are still far better off than the vast majority of people in the developing world, their own perceptions are quite different, and they increasingly see themselves as the victims of globalization.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 1 May 2017 | MYT 11:00 AM Smart home assistants need assistance to catch on Despite being a hands-free connection to potentially any element of an individual's digital life, the most popular use for DHAs is currently playing music (63%). — AFP Relaxnews Voice-operated digital home assistants could revolutionise the way we interact with technology and potentially any element of the smart home. However, for the moment at least, their appeal appears to be very limited, as is how they're being used. There's a lot of conversation around voice-activated home assistants, however, according to new data from GfK, there is currently very little conversation actually with devices like Amazon Echo or Google Home. People's comfort levels when it comes to consciously talking to a device have never been higher. Thanks to Apple's Siri and Google Now, 69% of US consumers aged between 13 and 64 say that they have used voice commands to operate their smartphone and 21% use the feature on a tablet. However, when it comes to the new generation of smart home assistants that are being aggressively marketed by Google and Amazon, only 11% of GfK's 1,012 respondent sample said that they currently owned one. Even though they've been on the market for almost two years and are very affordable devices – the Amazon Dot costs just US$49.99 (RM215) in the US – uptake is slow. The current split finds Amazon devices five times more popular than Google's and with just 3% of those surveyed indicating they had a strong intention of buying a digital home assistant (DHA) over the next 12 months, it appears as if Google won't be closing the gap in 2017, at least. Yet, even with comparatively low consumer penetration, trends are already beginning to emerge. Despite being a hands-free connection to potentially any element of an individual's digital life, the most popular use for DHAs is currently playing music (63%). Other popular uses include checking weather and traffic information, keeping up to date with sports results and operating other smart appliances such as lights and thermostats. But within the top 10 list of current uses, ordering products from Amazon is in 10th place, something that is potentially troubling to the online retailer who has a track record of selling devices at cost or even for a small loss in order to earn revenues from a device's connected services.

Just fix taxes by Paul R. La Monica   @lamonicabuzz April 27, 2017: 1:02 PM ET Trump's job creation, 100 days in To paraphrase former President George H.W. Bush, Wall Street has a message for President Trump. Read our lips. Just focus on taxes. Yes, the stock market has enjoyed a solid rally during the first 100 days of Trump's term in the White House. The Dow is up more than 6% and not far from an all-time high. Some of that has to do with strong earnings from Corporate America, continued signs of a resilient (if not necessarily robust) jobs market and optimism about an economic rebound in Europe and renewed momentum in China. But several investing experts say that the main reason for the rally is the continued hope that Trump will be able to come up with a plan (that Congress will approve) to lower taxes -- particularly for large businesses. Wall Street is willing to let Trump's failure to quickly repeal and replace Obamacare slide. Many strategists and portfolio managers aren't too concerned that Trump will prioritize building a wall on the border with Mexico and crack down further on immigration. Related: Trump's 15% business tax is lowest for a big economy And ironically enough, investors don't even seem to think that undoing the Dodd-Frank financial reform laws from the Obama administration should be a big priority either. They want to see movement on the tax front. In particular, Wall Street is hoping that any tax changes will allow for big companies with cash overseas to be able to bring back, or repatriate, the money to the United States at a one-time lower rate. Tech giants Apple (AAPL, Tech30), Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL, Tech30), Cisco (CSCO, Tech30) and Oracle (ORCL, Tech30) are sitting on more than half a trillion dollars in cash -- with a big chunk of that sitting in overseas bank accounts. Other large companies, like industrial conglomerate GE (GE), also have a significant amount of cash abroad. Related: Trump's tax plan could cost an estimated $5.5 trillion With the Federal Reserve now looking to keep raising short-term interest rates, Wall Street is turning to Trump to help stimulate the economy. Corporate tax reform could be the answer. And while some fear companies will just increase dividends and buy back stock with the cash -- moves that would help shareholders but not average Americans with little invested in stocks -- some think Trump could force companies to do more. "The repatriation of taxes could help the most," said TD Ameritrade chief market strategist JJ Kinahan. "But companies would have to reinvest a certain percentage of that in infrastructure. Trump has to make companies put their cash to work." Related: How Trump's tax plan would help the wealthy (and Trump) A.B. Mendez, a portfolio manager with Frost Investment Advisors, added that Trump could take it a step further and require that companies use some of the cash to explicitly hire more workers and build new plants in the United States. "Repatriation is an opportunity for Trump to create jobs. He can leverage his business background when he has more meetings with CEOs," Mendez said. "A meaningful part of repatriated cash should be used for capital expenditures, jobs and retraining -- and not just for financial engineering," he added. Investors around the world share that assessment. Luca Paolini, chief strategist with Pictet Asset Management in London, said that global investors think tax reform should be the number one priority for Trump. Infrastructure spending/stimulus and deregulation of the health care and financial industries should take a backseat to taxes. Paolini added that even though getting any significant changes to tax laws will not be easy, he thinks it's a mistake to assume that Trump's inability to kill the Affordable Care Act is a sign that he and Congress can't come to an agreement on taxes. But Wall Street is hoping that Trump will be able to help the little guy as well. Related: Here's Trump's record on the middle class Dave Haviland, managing partner at Beaumont Capital Management, said it will be equally important for Trump to try and simplify the tax code. "If people in the financial industry are having difficulty filling out their tax returns, then the process is way too complicated," he said. So the message from investors seems to be pretty clear. Dear Mr. President. Stop tweeting. Put down the phone. Forget about the wall and attacks on the media. Head over to Capitol Hill and get something done on taxes. "If Trump can get changes in only one area, the hope is that it will be tax reform. That would be doable," said Dan Miller, director of equities at GW&K Investment Management. "Tax reform can drive earnings to an even higher level."

Advertisement – Content Continues Below Brown and other supporters said the spaces offer drug users much more than just a place to satisfy their habit. “They can also access services land resources that are available like treatment, like housing,” Brown said. “Right. Like support, while also driving down disease, reducing overdoses.” Legal safer consumption spaces exist in more than 60 cities in Europe and Canada. However, none exist in the United States. Seattle recently approved legislation to build the first safer consumption space in the U.S. but they remain illegal in all other states, including New York. More than 100 New York City healthcare professionals signed a petition to change that last week as part of a statewide campaign to promote the idea in areas like the Capital Region, which is already seeing opposition to it. “People said, well they're not condoning it,” said Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple. “Well you are condoning it. You know they're in there and you're turning your head.” Apple also said the sites will not stop people from doing illegal drugs. “I don't think allowing people to go in there is the right thing to do because they're just going to continue to fuel their habit and feed their habit and I just have a hard time with that,” he said. “I don't think they're going to go to those places anyway,” said Cody Witbeck of Knox, NY. “If they're available, most drug addicts are going to do it right then and there.” Supporters and critics agree there is no easy answer to such a difficult problem. “How are they going to treat that,” said Aden Matthews of Scotia. “Are they going to wean them off of it? Are they going to keep them supplied with it?” “We still have people who are injecting in public,” Brown said. "We still have people who are homeless and don't have a safe place to use. Right?” Seattle may be the location of the country's first safe consumption space but the idea is becoming more popular in other states like Maryland, Vermont and California. The SAFE SHAPE tour, which raises awareness about the issue, visited the capital region last week and will continue in other parts of the state this week.

Send Feedback. For all that Silicon Valley the show and Silicon Valley the industry is about the unchecked promise of technology, the reality is that it’s more about the unchecked egos of its people. These are people packed into a bubble of constant one-upmanship, getting too much money too fast, high on the idea that they’ve developed something that can revolutionize the world. In the real world, look no further than Uber CEO and uber jackass Travis Kalanick, breaking rules up to the point that Apple’s CEO had to hold a knife to his company’s throat to make him back off. In the fictional world, look to the clashes in the combinations of Richard, Gavin, Peter, Jack, Russ, and Erlich—insults slung, companies slain, and millions of dollars wasted because of the inability to get along for a long period of time. In “Terms Of Services,” the latest war of ego takes place, and the results are a wonderful thing to witness. After setting up a new corporate structure in “Success Failure,” Silicon Valley knocks it down one episode later—but it does so in a way that’s entirely believable and in keeping with the personalities of everyone tangled up in this mess. The fleeting nature of success is one of the show’s core themes, and the sudden death of PiperChat may set a new record for shortest company lifespan. But while PiperChat is not long for this world, “Terms Of Service” does permit us some time to spend with the benefits of the new world order, chief among them being CEO Dinesh Chugtai. As predicted last week, it takes almost no time for the power to go to his head, and reinvent himself in the manner of someone with an Entourage-like view of success: sharkskin blazer, heavily gelled hair, and talking up his company in terms like “so sticky it’s pornographic.” After so long playing sullen and acerbic, you can tell Kumail Nanjiani is relishing the chance to play an obnoxious douche, and that enjoyment from his meetings and media appearances is contagious. Thomas Middleditch (Image: HBO) Where he goes wrong though is in deciding that he has to start fresh, which includes burning the bridges between regimes. The team separation is made apparent instantly, writer Clay Tarver revisiting the Hoberman Switch Pitch game around the table that’s been part of so many celebratory team scenes and that instantly goes quiet as Richard walks in. While Jared tries to handle it politely by promoting “bifurcation” in their conversations, Dinesh is all about solidifying his power, including reminding Richard of the Intersite disaster. Not a bad accusation—Richard was, as noted many times, not the best of CEOs—but it’s making things unnecessarily personal in the name of consolidating a position that Richard was making no moves to threaten. And it feeds back on him, making Richard nastier than he’s ever been and calling the man he handed his company to “a total fucking douchebag.” Yet despite all of that, it’s still Richard who saves Dinesh’s hide. While Dinesh spoke of the importance of building a legitimate company, Richard’s focus has never strayed far from the data, and he identifies the swiftly growing rot in their users. It’s a discovery that leads to the ever-welcome return of Matt Mccoy as troubled lawyer Pete Monahan, now out on work release and considering the law as soberly as he considers his crimes. (“My shame will linger long after my voting rights are restored.”) As he observes, thanks to Dinesh not correctly porting over terms of service, pre-teen users are flocking to PiperChat in vast numbers. It’s a glaring violation of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act—and putting the company on the hook for astronomical fines. So many of Silicon Valley’s best moments take place in Erlich’s living room, and as framed by Mike Judge’s direction this is easily one of the upper tier moments. Dinesh’s absolutely devastated face as he realizes what he’s gotten himself into is paired with the quiet delight brewing on Gilfoyle, popping the champagne he clearly purchased for the post-pride fall. Jared, so readily mocked by the acerbic programmer, now can only offer worst-case scenarios up to testifying against him. (“Jared, I trusted you.” “Oh, trust has nothing to do with it. But thanks for making it official!”) And it all plays out as the cheerful blooping of new users signing up for PiperChat continues in the background, the digital beating of its hideous heart. Jimmy O. Yang, T.J. Miller (Image: HBO) Once again though, it’s Richard who comes through for Dinesh despite the bad blood. It’s a nicely sincere performance from Thomas Middleditch as he tries to talk the other man off the ledge (or out of the tub as it were), a new level of understanding that exists between the two. Richard’s rise and fall and rise to CEOdom is littered with failures, so he understands just how easy it is to misstep and lose everything—including your lunch, into your pants. There’s even a little bit of regret in his actions, knowing that he handed this much power to someone who was the least capable of handling it. And after so long of being lost in the wilderness, he’s the one who’s got wisdom to dispense: “I found it was more about choosing the one wrong answer that you can live with.” Salvation, when it comes, comes from the most unlikely of services. Gavin’s attentions remain focused on Jack Barker, who despite exile to the server basement office remains unfailingly energetic about new business ideas. His increasing paranoia leads him to confide more strongly in Hoover, rattling Denpak and leading to a delightful war of dueling sycophants. These two characters have never interacted before this point, but we’ve had enough instances of their interactions with Gavin to see they know how to manipulate him in the right direction, and little regard for how whatever they say bounces off on anyone who isn’t them. (And the fact that Denpak steals break room creamers is perfect punctuation to that scene. Perhaps like in Better Off Ted, it’s a quiet act of rebellion?) Matt Ross, Christopher James Williams, Bernard White (Image: HBO) The two guide Gavin’s wrath back to one of his favorite targets, Pied Piper, and once again he makes a play to buy the company to get his hands on their video chat logs. Gavin trying to get this company is another long-running Silicon Valley beat, but here it manages to feel fresh because for once his lingering pettiness about being screwed in the courts of law and public opinion has nothing to do with it. All he he just wants to get his hands on video chat logs that may or may not exist he can use in his entirely one-sided war with Jack. Here’s where the true interplay of egos in “Terms Of Service” really pays off, a moment that plays out on Dinesh’s face at the same tie it does the audience’s: it was Dinesh’s ego in comparing PiperChat to HooliChat on all his interviews that gave Gavin his ammunition for a hostile takeover, and it’s Gavin’s ego that’s leading him to speed ahead and acquire the company without any of the due diligence Jared warned he’s famous for. So the acquisition goes through, and the full burden of PiperChat’s legal woes are transferred to a company that can could feasibly afford $21 billion in fines. That revelation makes for a terrific final beat to the episode (and the ever-welcome return of the Hooli focus group) as the mean age of PiperChat/HooliChat’s users is apparent to Gavin within minutes, leading to a rageful expression not seen since he realized that Nucleus was Apple maps bad. Another day, another easily avoided disaster in the world of Silicon Valley. Stray observations: This week’s closing track: “Fun House,” Pregnant Boy featuring OG Swaggerdick and Grip Plyaz. Erlich’s b-plot doesn’t have much to do with the main narrative, but it does contain the same warning of looking before you leap. Thinking that Jian-Yang’s got his foot in the door on VR tech—“the frothiest space in the valley”—he agrees to let Jian-Yang live in the house again with pool privileges and crisper drawer access, before learning he’s developing a Chinese recipe app. It’s also an encouraging sign that they’re letting Jian-Yang be more of an active character, and pushing back on Erlich’s bullying, when for the past three seasons he’s been a potentially racist joke about language barriers at best. Some fun callbacks this episode: Dinesh curled up in the bathtub similar to Richard in “Daily Active Users,” Gavin bringing his own pre-packaged fruit to the Mexican restaurant as he did in “Runaway Devaluation.” It’s a great detail that Big Head both gives Richard what he needs to get into PiperChat’s data (along with his Skyrim cheat codes), and also dooms Erlich by confusing Oculus and octopus. Big Head giveth, Big Head taketh away. Jack compares his basement demotion to the humbling of Disney CEO Bob Iger forcing his higher-level employees to wear the Goofy suit. If Silicon Valley were to introduce a plot that forced someone to wear a Pipey suit, I would not be opposed. Pete’s elbow moves to return Jared the computer are fun to witness. Is he doing that because his hands are soaked from washing cars, because his work release means he can’t touch a computer, or because he doesn’t want his fingerprints on a physical connection to COPPA violations? Your call, viewers. Erlich is smoking both a bong and a pipe during the party scene. “It’s ‘hards-on,’ that’s syntactical error!” “Have you seen the new Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue? The cover model has the most lovely and enigmatic facial expressions.” “Richard entered us without consent.” “He even referred to you as Gavin Smellson.” “It’s basically a Sizzler buffet for the sexually deranged.” “I hope you have a good lawyer.” “He works at the car wash down the street.” “What?” “Now, Carl, you said the new sign-in page made you nervous.” Filed Under: TV, Silicon Valley, Kumail Nanjiani, Thomas Middleditch, T.J.

Tsvangirai goes digital – Nehanda Radio Home News Politics Business Opinion Bizarre Courts Local Diaspora World Showbiz Sports Search 15 C Harare Monday, May 1, 2017 About Us Contact Us Advertising Listen to Radio Privacy Policy Who is Who News Alerts Nehanda Radio Home News Politics Business Opinion Bizarre Courts Local Diaspora World Showbiz Sports Home News Tsvangirai goes digital News Politics Popular Tsvangirai goes digital Apr 28, 2017 64 14163 By Bridget Mananavire MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai has embraced technology by launching an online campaign to rally support ahead of the crucial 2018 election. The long-time President Robert Mugabe rival’s digital campaign includes a website — votemorgan.org — and a mobile application called “Morgan” that can be downloaded on the Apple app and Google play stores. On the website and application, also supported by social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, the former Prime Minister seeks to connect with his supporters through a live chat platform. “As we progress to 2018, I want to assure you that I will be here to share my ideas and thoughts and engage with you as much as possible . . . the website . . . will herald the campaign we are getting into,” Tsvangirai said as he announced the campaign on his Facebook page. Mobile applications will be available to make sure that we keep in touch as much as often in this crucial season,” he said. “You will be able to ask me questions . . . We are also looking for creatives, community organisers, tech-heads and policy experts who would like to volunteer to this campaign,” he added. This comes as MDC has deployed its senior party officials to rural areas to consolidate its support base in the countryside communities, where the majority of people reside. Last week, the party signed Memoranda of Understandings to consummate an alliance with other opposition parties. “In the face of partisan gridlock and powerful, deep-pocketed interests, we refuse to be cynical about what we can accomplish. We have proved naysayers wrong before, and we look forward to doing it again. “In our four years in the inclusive government, Zimbabweans can testify to how we positively changed their lives even though we had Zanu PF as an albatross. “We stabilised the economy, we opened schools and hospitals, we grew the economy and above all, we gave Zimbabweans a new Constitution,” Tsvangirai said.

It is only a fool who will fall for such cheap politics. It is evident that the 1980 government has proved any reasonable doubt that it has failed its citizenry. It does not need a rocket scientist to interpret this calamity. Industry and economy collapsed under their watch and can not extricate themselves from the mess they created . It is not about ego guys but paving way for others with fresh ideas of running the economy and improving the lives of the ordinary citizens.

Nokia and Huawei are among the firms with indirect connections to smelters named in the Reuters report. Photo: Staff Several of the firms named in the report told The Myanmar Times they were responding to the findings. The Reuters investigation claims that several Chinese-controlled firms which source tin indirectly from the Man Maw mine in northeast Myanmar are also listed suppliers for a range of international companies including Apple, Starbucks, Huawei, General Electric and Nokia. As a result, these companies may face the possibility of violating sanctions that the United States placed on the UWSA for suspected narcotics trafficking in 2003, the report said. Several sanctions experts told Reuters the US government was “unlikely to fine companies who unwittingly used the Myanmar tin”, although it could push them to switch suppliers. “The situation illustrates the difficulties facing multinationals in monitoring supply chains that have grown increasingly complex,” the Reuters report said. The Myanmar Times contacted several of the international firms cited in the report. A spokesperson for General Electric said that the company would address the issues and that it “routinely examine[s] the smelters in our global supply chain either through direct audits or those performed by groups such as the [industry group] Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative [CFSI]”. Maggie Qi from the Huawei media affairs team said that Yunnan Tin, which Reuters reported has sourced tin from the UWSA-operated mine, was a “very small supplier to one of [Huawei’s] contractors”. Although Huawei has no direct contract with Yunnan Tin, Ms Qi said her company had the Yunnan firm’s response to the issues raised. Huawei will consider its next step once it receives an answer, she added. “[Huawei] expects all suppliers and their contractors to comply with all local laws and ethics,” said Ms Qi. “We will take all necessary actions when these standards are unmet.” International communications lead at Nokia Spencer Swartz said that although his firm does use Chinese smelting firms mentioned in the Reuters report, they are “are not direct suppliers of ours”. “Tin smelters and refineries only provide a small share of their products to the information and communications technology industry and thus are several tiers away from Nokia,” said Mr Swartz. Nokia recognises the risk that the illegal extraction and trading of conflict minerals may cause human rights violations and environmental degradation, he added. But the firm focuses its due diligence efforts on its tier-1 suppliers, “where we can make the largest impact”, Mr Swartz said. Due to the company’s “relative lack of exposure” to tin, it relies on industry programs like CFSI, he added. Yunnan Tin is among those firms validated conflict-free by CFSI’s Conflict-Free Smelter Program audits, Mr Swartz said. “We have not seen enough evidence that Yunnan Tin would source tin from UWSA-controlled mines,” he said, but added that if further evidence is presented “we will gladly receive it, run further due diligence and then notify our suppliers and escalate the issue as needed”. For some industry experts in Myanmar, the Reuters report is hardly surprising. “Ever since the news started emerging a few years ago of significant tin exports from Myanmar to China, [we] have been alerting commodity traders and relevant companies with whom we are in contact who have tin in their supply chain that this is a human rights risk which they should address in due diligence,” said director of the Myanmar Centre for Responsible Business Vicky Bowman. Ms Bowman said the “involvement of the UWSA as a sanctioned Myanmar organisation should also be on the radar screen for US companies” although if the tin is considered legally imported into China by third parties this is “likely to be very challenging”. She said a new EU conflict minerals regulation, yet to be adopted, would “shake up certification and sourcing programmes” around “conflict tin” and could affect Myanmar. “Most of the areas of Myanmar from which tin is extracted – not only Wa areas – should definitely be considered conflict and high-risk areas”.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Monday May 1, 2017 Opinion Larger / SmallerNight Mode We're slaves to new products, but no closer to happiness RICHARD GRUNER 14 Sep 2012, 7:08 p.m. Economic wheels must turn but how far to go until we feel the burn? We're slaves to new products, but no closer to happiness Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit OPINION You would like the new iPhone 5. That's not even a question. You would. Why wouldn't you? It is new, probably faster, and definitely shinier than your old phone. When the new model is released in Australia on September 21, vast numbers of people are expected to line up outside Apple stores. Some might even sleep out on the pavement the night before. Breakfast TV programs will dispatch journalists to breathlessly report the phenomenon. But at what cost? Perhaps it is time for us to question our perpetual product cravings, and accept that "old", "used", and even "broken" are not dirty words. Only 75 years ago we consumed half as much as we do today, and we were no less happy because of it. What (or who) is it that makes us crave new products and queue up outside the store hours, and even days, before their launch?  Our past experiences of new products - in-your-face advertising, clever marketing techniques, word-of-mouth ploys, and so on - certainly play a role in our behaviour. But that may be just part of the picture. A glimpse at the bigger picture reveals that our product cravings are as essential to our economy's stability as jobs, exports and interest rates. Global financial services company JPMorgan Chase recently estimated that the release of the iPhone 5 could add up to one-half of a percentage point to the gross domestic product growth rate of the struggling United States economy. And that's just one product! Today's consumer culture has been manufactured and composed in response to the very real need for ever higher levels of consumption of millions of products. We now even have the concept of ''planned obsolescence'', where companies intentionally design products with a limited shelf life. This forces customers to buy the same (or similar) product again in the future. (You might consider it the technological equivalent of shampoo companies urging users to ''rinse and repeat''.) Some question the ethics of intentionally designing a product to be obsolete within just a few years - and long for the time when things were built to last - but the economic benefits are undeniable. It's all part of what drives ''infinite growth''. And it's why a lot of companies spend as much on advertising as they do on actually creating new products. Companies have created this perceived ''need'' in their customers. And, conveniently, they are right there to meet these needs through constant innovation. Businesses cannot continue to offer the same unchanged product for very long if they wish to make a profit and continue to grow. Does that mean that our hunger for product innovations is bad? On one hand, it is the lifeblood of companies, our economy and society at large. The world as we know it might just collapse if we stopped designing, making, buying and selling snazzy new products. (At least, so we're told.) On the other hand, what's at stake here might be nothing less than our happiness - a deep happiness that goes well beyond the short-lived thrill of bringing home a new phone, car or computer. For most of us, our sense of prosperity does not depend on owning the latest gadgets. Neither does it depend on other success measures we tend to apply to our lives, such as outperforming a competitor, or having the smartest and fastest kid at school. As contemporary Swiss-born philosopher Alain de Botton tells us, "wealth does not involve having many things". It is more about having what we long for. Wealth is relative to desire. It is not absolute. Every time we seek something we cannot afford, we grow poorer, regardless of how much money we have. And every time we stop our hunt for the new and feel satisfied with what we have, we can be counted as rich. In other words, we are rich in proportion to the things we can do without. Political philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau knew this in the late 1700s - before cars, computers and credit cards - when he said: "Our souls rarely articulate what they must have in order to be satisfied, or when they do mumble something, their commands are likely to be misfounded or contradictory." Perhaps it is time for us to distinguish between what we want, what companies tell us we need, and what we really need. And that's something that no shiny new product, not even one carrying a fruity logo, can do for you. Dr Richard L. Gruner is a marketing research fellow at the University of Melbourne's faculty of business and economics.

Newton was the first mass-produced touchscreen handheld computer made by Apple. It only lasted a few years on the market (1993 to 1998), but that wasn’t because it sucked! A large community of people still love Newton, and this film is an homage to the little device(s) by the people who still remember and even still use one. It’s a 90-minute documentary about the Newton and the community that is still in love with it today.

By Steve Brachmann April 28, 2017 36 Print Article On May 26th, 2016, a panel of administrative patent judges (APJs) at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) entered a final written decision ending the proceedings of a covered business method (CBM) review of U.S. Patent No. 8336772, titled Data Storage and Access Systems. The final decision declared that four of the patent’s claims, including claim 1, were directed to subject matter that was invalid under 35 U.S.C. Section 101. The patent, owned by tech licensing firm Smartflash, covers data storage and access systems, which enable downloading and paying for many types of data, including audio, video, software, games and text. The petition for the CBM review was originally filed on November 25th, 2014, by Cupertino, CA-based tech giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) The ‘772 patent is one of six patents asserted by Smartflash in a patent infringement action filed against multiple defendants, including Apple, on May 29th, 2013, a year and a half before Apple’s CBM petition on the ‘772 patent at PTAB. The Code of Conduct for United States Judges sets the rules judges presiding over federal courtrooms must adhere. In rules regarding the fair, impartial and diligent performance of a judge’s duties, the code of conduct outlines the circumstances under which a federal judge must disqualify himself or herself from a case because of reasonable questions of impartiality. These circumstances include when a judge has a personal bias concerning a party or the proceeding; when the judge served as a lawyer in the matter in controversy; or a judge has a financial interest in either the subject matter or a party in the case. The lead APJ serving on the panel of multiple CBM reviews petitioned by Apple, who also wrote the final written decision on at least one CBM review petitioned by Apple and invalidated claims of the ‘772 patent, was Administrative Patent Judge Matt Clements. According to Clements’ LinkedIn profile, he has served as an administrative patent judge at PTAB since March 2013; up until that time he served as a patent attorney at international law firm Ropes & Gray going as far back to September 2006. While at Ropes & Gray, Clements was part of a legal team that represented Apple in patent infringement cases. According to legal party data made available by Law360, Clements served as counsel for Apple up to December 2012 and served on a team with fellow Ropes & Gray lawyer James Batchelder as well as Eric Albritton of the Albritton Law Firm. Both Batchelder and Albritton were counsel of record representing Apple in the Smartflash infringement case where the ‘772 patent was asserted against Apple. Batchelder and Clements both worked at Ropes & Gray’s East Palo Alto offices, where Batchelder served as managing partner, so there’s a distinct likelihood that Clements reported directly to Batchelder in his work with Ropes & Gray. The November 2014 petition by Apple for CBM review of the ‘772 patent was also filed by counsel from Ropes & Gray including Ching-Lee Fukuda, another one of the lawyers representing Apple in the Smartflash action. These types of relationships would have led to the recusal of a federal judge on a matter, but obviously did not affect the participation and decision making of APJ Clements. When reached for comment on what appears to be a very troubling, actual and direct conflict of interest involving APJ Clements, a USPTO spokesperson declined to comment, saying: “The USPTO does not comment on cases.” In recent years, Smartflash has been the victim of a corporate drubbing at PTAB and has faced a total of 46 petitions for CBM review filed against the patents it has asserted in its infringement case against Apple, including 10 CBMs targeting the ‘772 patent alone. Most of the petitions have been filed by Apple, although Korean consumer tech conglomerate Samsung Electronics (KRX:005930) and Mountain View, CA-based Internet services giant Google, now held by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), have also filed petitions against patents asserted by Smartflash in other patent infringement actions against those companies. Given the fact that a potential conflict of interest exists with at least one of the APJs sitting on the PTAB panel deciding the validity of Smartflash’s claims, counsel representing Smartflash submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for the disclosure of documents and information held by the federal government pertaining to two items: the applications for APJ positions at the PTAB of all current APJs including job applications, submitted resumes, submitted references and records of contacting references; and records pertaining to PTAB procedures for assigning APJs to panels for CBM or inter partes review (IPR) proceedings including standard operating procedures, prior versions of standard operating procedures and records indicating why changes were made to standard operating procedures. On March 17th, 2017, the USPTO sent an interim response to the FOIA request, which included documents pertaining to standard operating procedures for assigning APJs to reviews; the agency was still reviewing documents related to applications for all current APJs. Of the 57 pages of documents identified by USPTO as responsive to Smartflash’s request for operating procedure documentation, a total of 52 pages have been withheld, two pages have been partially redacted and only three pages related to the distribution of cases by trial type and technology are released in full. The two partially redacted pages include e-mails from a sender whose identity remains confidential, including a July 2014 e-mail distributed to America Invents Act (AIA) trial judges which asked those judges to return data on cases in which they were responsible for drafting a decision to institute or a final written decision. In Smartflash’s case against Apple in the Eastern District of Texas (E.D. Tex.), Smartflash prevailed on all of the Section 101 invalidity challenges put forward by Apple in the case. A report and recommendation issued by an E.D. Tex. magistrate judge on January 21st, 2015, in response to Apple and Samsung motions for summary judgment for invalid subject matter under Section 101 found that the asserted claims of the Smartflash patents satisfied step two of the Alice/Mayo framework and thus were directed to patent-eligible subject matter. The magistrate judge’s rejected Apple’s argument that the Smartflash patents were similar to the claims invalidated in 2014’s Ultramercial Inc. v. Hulu LLC, a case in which patents which covered methods for viewing copyrighted content at no cost in return for viewing an advertisement were invalidated. E.D. Tex. officially adopted the magistrate judge’s findings and denied the motions for summary judgment on February 13th, 2015. Apple tried to reopen the Section 101 validity challenge by filing a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b). In a court order filed July 8th, 2015, the court declined to revise its summary judgment, stating that “The § 101 issue has already received full and fair treatment.” Smartflash also prevailed on patent validity challenges raised under 35 U.S.C. Section 102 (novelty) and 35 U.S.C. 103 (non-obviousness) in Apple’s CBM petitions on the ‘772 patent. As the petition for CBM review filed by Apple notes, PTAB had previously denied institution to Apple’s petitions challenging validity under §102 and §103 because the Board concluded that Apple had not shown that it was likely it would prevail in demonstrating that cited combinations of prior art rendered obvious limitations of the Smartflash claims. In switching to its challenges of the ‘772 patent under §101, Apple argued that claims directed to “a data access terminal” essentially comprised a “general purpose computer.” Of course, it doesn’t take a computer expert to understand that general purpose computers in October 1999, the priority date of the application for the ‘772 patent, were not capable of the kind of data access technology covered by the ‘772 patent. It’s also important to note here that the ‘772 claims are directed to a handheld multimedia terminal. If those claims are directed to a “general purpose computer,” then what does that say about the patents Apple continues to obtain which are directed at computer-implemented methods? On February 21st, 2017, Smartflash filed an opening brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in which Smartflash asks the Federal Circuit to consider whether the PTAB erred in determining that its patents were subject to CBM reviews and whether claims directed to a specific network architecture and distribution of functionalities, which enable convenient purchases of digital content while preventing piracy and allowing only permitted uses of proprietary content, are patent-eligible under 35 U.S.C. Section 101. Smartflash’s brief argues that while payment is an aspect of the claims, the inventions themselves are not used in any financial product or service. Further, the claims that have been deemed ineligible by the PTAB as “abstract ideas” actually describe novel distributions of functions among devices in a computer network, teaching specific solutions to technological problems associated with the distribution of content over the Internet. Smartflash’s brief cites numerous cases as a basis for this argument, including Federal Circuit decisions in 2014’s DDR Holdings, LLC v. Hotels.com, L.P., et. al. and 2016’s BASCOM Global Internet Services, Inc. v. AT&T Mobility LLC, et. al. Further, Smartflash argues that the conclusions of the PTAB were legally erroneous by dismissing individual claim elements as conventional without considering the claims as an ordered combination in violation of the standard set by the Federal Circuit in 2016’s Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corporation, et. al. The current incarnation of the U.S. patent system is a nightmare for smaller players fighting legitimate claims of infringement against large, entrenched corporate interests, and every branch of the federal government has been complicit in the destruction of Constitutionally-protected property rights. The PTAB was created by Congress through passage and enactment of the AIA in 2011. The executive branch, which is ultimately responsible for the activities of the USPTO and PTAB, has failed to create a code of conduct which requires recusal and therefore cannot provide any reasonable assurance that justice is actually being served in the face of conflicts of interest. The swell of invalidity challenges under §101 are the direct result of the Supreme Court’s controversial decisions in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International and Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. Normally one dead canary is enough to realize that it’s time to get out of the mine. The floors of PTAB are littered with an entire flock’s worth of dead claims that have been declared invalid, and it appears that those claims might be invalidated more at the behest of Apple and other tech giants than any cohesive rule of law. Readers who are piqued by this story should stay tuned; this is not the last report we’ll have on the legal issues raised by the proceedings in Smartflash v. Apple.

Scott Benning April 28, 2017 4:32 pm So the question it seems boils down to this: Will anyone within the Trump administration care about what is happening here? Are they glad it’s happening? Or perhaps are they unhappy but are too ignorant or lazy to do anything about it? I recall Peter Thiel was an ‘inside man’ with Trump on tech issues; perhaps a little lobbying of Peter might pay some benefits here. My last question is: do small inventors have a voice anywhere within the 3 branches of government? I am completely discouraged that America has lost her way in this too-important area that has in the past made America great. Scott McQuarrie April 28, 2017 6:35 pm Public confidence in the integrity of the judicial system is part of the necessary foundation of democracy. Without it, the judicial branch loses it legitimacy in the eyes of the public. That PTAB is a tribunal, and not part of our judicial branch, does not excuse it from this necessity. To discharge its quasi judicial function effectively requires the same public confidence in its competence and impartiality. Unfortunately, and for legitimate reason, there is no confidence in either. Many parties are complicit, most of all the large corporations (some mentioned in this article) who pushed for AIA knowing they would be able to “efficiently infringe” successfully most of the time and by doing so increase their bottom line. What has been happening at PTAB is appalling, disgraceful and certainly has the appearance of impropriety, if not more. It is harming not only many patent holders, but also, and more importantly, the country as a whole. It is past time for this nightmare to end. Until it does, how much harm (and deprivation of property without due process of law) must occur before our government takes the action necessary to reform USPTO? Paul Morinville April 28, 2017 7:35 pm This is what happens in third world property right systems like the USPTO has become. It’s happening in Venezuela and dozens of African nations. When one person has full control of the creation and destruction of a property right, corruption seeps in. It is not possible to stop it. The only way to fix the PTAB is to eliminate it. Troy April 28, 2017 8:28 pm More melodramatic nonsense from the TMZ of patent law. And the usual cackling hens just eat it up. LOL Bp April 28, 2017 11:58 pm 8. A data access terminal for controlling access to one or more content data items stored on a data carrier, the data access terminal comprising: a user interface; a data carrier interface; a program store storing code implementable by a processor; and a processor coupled to the user interface, to the data carrier interface and to the program store for implementing the stored code the code comprising: code to request identifier data identifying one or more content data items stored on the data carrier; code to receive said identifier data; code to present to a user via said user interface said identified one or more content data items available from the data carrier; code to receive a user selection selecting at least one of said one or more of said stored content data items; code responsive to said user selection of said selected content data item to transmit payment data relating to payment for said selected content item for validation by a payment validation system; code to receive payment validation data defining if said payment validation system has validated payment for said content data item; and code to control access to said selected content data item responsive to the payment validation data. Why didn’t the author of this article actually quote the claims involved in this case? Paul Antonio April 29, 2017 6:20 am What About USPTO Director who served Google for 10 years? anonymous April 29, 2017 9:23 am @4 because this website does not want to have an opportunity to attack the PTAB wasted by something as irrelevant as facts. They prefer a guilt by association story about a judge who has done some work for real world companies before he became he a judge. If you want to recruit judges who know what they are talking about,you cannot (and should not) avoid that they have some history with part of the companies he will see in court. It is only a conflict of interest if he is still payed by Apple and it is only a problem if his decisions are not in line with the facts and the law. This claim is obviously not describing an invention of any sorts. A user selects data items and pays for it. The software validates the payment and allows the user to access the content data item. That’s all. Nothing more. This has been done on computers at least since Musk started Paypal in 1998, and in the real world since at least 10,000 BC. Paul Morinville April 29, 2017 9:36 am Bp @4. The article is about a conflict of interest, which looks pretty obvious to me. The claims have nothing to do with the decision if the kangaroo court is corrupt. The integrity of the court comes first. Anon April 29, 2017 10:15 am Bp, I echo Mr. Morinville’s reply in that you seek to “kick up dust” and switch the focus to some type of “defend the claim” game. To then provide a short and direct answer to your question of “why,”: because the answer you seek (inclusion of claims) is not pertinent to the legal issue being discussed. Gene Quinn April 29, 2017 10:56 am Troy @5- Thanks for the compliment! Obviously, this is not nonsense. Only someone truly ignorant and unfamiliar with the law on even the most rudimentary level would think (let alone say) that this clear breach of ethics is nonsense. -Gene Gene Quinn April 29, 2017 10:59 am anonymous @8- What a truly ignorant comment. APJ Clements acted in an unethical way, full stop! You cannot adjudicate a matter involving a former client. There are thousands of cases filed at the PTAB every year. Clements didn’t represent every stakeholder. It would be EASY for him to recuse himself from matters dealing with former clients. That is what federal judges do every day. It is what attorneys do every day. An attorney who engaged in this type of ethical breach would be sanctioned, period. So you can pretend this is irrelevant, or there are no facts to support what is reported. You are, however, only fooling yourself. Thank god you used a fake name so you didn’t embarrass yourself! -Gene anonymous April 29, 2017 11:33 am @12 As an attorney, you cannot work for Apple and Samsung simultaneously. But you can stop working for Apple and start working for Samsung. Not at day one, and not on the same cases you worked on before, but you can. And it is what most attorneys do. Otherwise they may run out of clients pretty fast. When you switch firms (or when your client does), you have to be able to continue working in the same technical area. Judges are supposed to rule based on facts. When there are serious signals that a judge makes decisions that do not align with the facts, alarm bells should ring and his professional history may indeed become very relevant. But if you want to ring that alarm bell, you should at least show where and how this judge made a wrong decision. In this case, the patent was obviously invalid and the judge clearly made the right decision. Off-topic: the hostility from this website against some companies, public officials, government organizations, judges, the PTAB and anyone else who dares to have a slightly different opinion is becooming quite annoying and does not do a good service to the IP profession in general. When people who express a different opinion on you website don’t dare to use their own name, that could indeed be an attempt to hide their stupidity, but it may also be because the aggressiveness and hostility they know they can expect. Gene Quinn April 29, 2017 12:33 pm anonymous @13- I am happy to have an in depth ethical discussion with you if that is what you want to do. It will not, however, take place with you remaining anonymous. I have no interest in debating with an ethically challenged, anonymous commenter. I’ll just point out the obvious stupidity of your comment. You say: “But if you want to ring that alarm bell, you should at least show where and how this judge made a wrong decision.” That isn’t how ethics work. You do not absolve yourself of an actual conflict by pointing out that substantively no legal wrong occurred. A lawyer should know this. Judges cannot be allowed to decide cases involving former clients, period. It is a very simple concept. One that everyone should understand. And one that you absolutely would understand if an APJ on the panel had previously represented Smartflash. You and so many others like you would be screaming at the top of your lungs that there was bias involved and unethical behavior. -Gene Gene Quinn April 29, 2017 12:39 pm anonymous @12- One more thing… if we are so openly hostile and you can’t stomach what we publish and my comments in particular, why do you keep reading? The easy solution is to stop visiting and go elsewhere. As far as I can tell we are one of the few, perhaps only, publications that challenges the powers that be. You should very easily be able to find all kinds of articles and commentary from those who think patents are evil, the PTAB is brilliant, the Supreme Court is doing a fantastic job on patents, examiners who never issue patents should receive medals, and the Federal Circuit should simply deny all patent owner appeals without explaining why. Seriously, I’m getting tired of trolls like you coming here and lecturing me. If you don’t like what we have to say then stop visiting. Of course, I note that you and others like you can never point to anything we get factually incorrect. Funny how we are hostile yet always factually accurate. -Gene anonymous April 29, 2017 1:06 pm It’s not all black and white, Gene. There are positions possible somewhere in between all out war and thinking that “the PTAB is brilliant, the Supreme Court is doing a fantastic job on patents, examiners who never issue patents should receive medals, and the Federal Circuit should simply deny all patent owner appeals without explaining why” If you were white and that guy at Techrights were black, I’d consider myself off-white. But no matter what my opinions are, I like to also read and discuss others’. Do you only read opinions and websites that you like? That would certainly explain the atmosphere here. Apparently, dissenting opinion are considered trolling here. No problem, I’ll stop commenting here (and I just started). This was the last one. Have fun! See you in court! Bp April 29, 2017 2:01 pm If the claim is not patentable, then apple did not get a preferential decision. the claims are very relevant to the article. There have been numerous software related 101 cases from the fed. cir. during all this. To say that the claims don’t matter when the article asserts that apple is getting “preferential treatment” is….not reasonable. Shawn Ambwani April 29, 2017 2:03 pm Actually, Gene, there are a lot of things that you say that are factually incorrect. I am happy to point them out and have in the past, but they are so numerous it is difficult to sometimes keep up. Also, I am always happy to say who I am and my affiliation, Unified Patents. Have a great weekend. Paul Morinville April 29, 2017 2:21 pm Bp. You can’t take the result to justify the action that brought the result. Perhaps the same result may have been reached had the judge recused himself, but that cannot be proven. What can be proven is the judge should have recused himself because of a conflict. Because he didn’t and he was obviously conflicted, his integrity is in question and therefore the integrity of the result is in question. I’m not a lawyer, and it appears you are not either, but even I can tell that your logic is not sound. Paul Morinville April 29, 2017 2:29 pm Shawn Ambwani, you have been silent until recently. Now you stalk this blog and my LinkedIn posts. You built your company on an obscenely unfair law that has wrecked the capitalization of startups here and sent them to China. You worry that your house of cards is about to collapse and now you arrogantly attack those who bring light to the corrupted system. Thank you for posting and have a nice day. Scott McQuarrie April 29, 2017 3:45 pm Appearances matter. A lot. Why? Because they directly impact the public’s confidence in the integrity of the judicial process. Such confidence is a requisite of the “consent of the governed.” It must never be taken for granted (study history). Regardless of whether corruption (usually concealed and difficult to prove) can be proven, what happened here does not pass the “smell test.” APJs, wielding the power that they have, should be required to avoid putting, and when not required, should instinctively know better than to put, themselves in this situation. Apparently, there is no rule at USPTO that would require an APJ to recuse himself from a particular case where he had previously (and recently) represented one of the parties (not to mention representation of that party in the same field, where similar legal issues and his knowledge, and former advocacy, of his former client’s strategic position regarding those issues could be relevant). Apparently, there is no rule at USPTO that would require that an APJ who recently practiced with a particular law firm recuse himself where that firm (not to mention his former colleagues and supervisor there) represent one of the parties in the case before him. Apparently, the culture at USPTO is not such that an APJ, in the absence of such a rule, would know, or be expected, to recuse himself under either of those circumstances. All of these represent, among other things, an obvious failure of USPTO leadership. An organization’s culture is the responsibility of its leaders. Rules are one important, but not the only, tool. Active communication, and enforcement, of cultural expectations is another. It is shocking that nobody knew any better. Or, did they? This is, at best, a dereliction that should trouble every ethical lawyer, regardless of what side of the bar they practice for. At worst, we are left to wonder. The impact on public confidence on USPTO integrity is unarguable. In the jurisdictions (state and federal) in which I have practiced for 30+ years, none of these would have happened (and I saw sua sponte recusals with regularity). It is stunning that in 2017 this could be happening in any agency of the federal government. Those having oversight responsibility for USPTO surely understand the importance of the public’s confidence in government, particularly where that agency wields so much power over people’s livelihood. Ignoring festering problems such as this, which erode public confidence in the integrity of the judicial process, and thereby infect the lifeblood of democracy, will only increase the temperature in the pot. Action is way overdue. David April 29, 2017 3:58 pm Steve B, If you are interesting in researching this issue further, I recommend the following: Compare the rules governing Article III district court recusals with the rules governing PTAB APJ recusals. Witout a frame of reference, the discussion devolves into finger pointing. Anon April 29, 2017 4:23 pm “Compare the rules governing Article III district court recusals with the rules governing PTAB APJ recusals.” Do you have a link? David April 29, 2017 4:53 pm No anon, I don’t. But perhaps we will after Steve writes the article! Scott McQuarrie April 29, 2017 7:04 pm Here is a start. Code of Conduct for United States Judges. http://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/code-conduct-united-states-judges This applies to Article III judges. Don’t know whether something elsewhere (such as a USPTO regulation) makes it, or something similar, applicable to USPTO APJs. ” Canon 2: A Judge Should Avoid Impropriety and the Appearance of Impropriety in all Activities (A) Respect for Law. A judge should respect and comply with the law and should act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. …. COMMENTARY Canon 2A. An appearance of impropriety occurs when reasonable minds, with knowledge of all the relevant circumstances disclosed by a reasonable inquiry, would conclude that the judge’s honesty, integrity, impartiality, temperament, or fitness to serve as a judge is impaired. Public confidence in the judiciary is eroded by irresponsible or improper conduct by judges. A judge must avoid all impropriety and appearance of impropriety. This prohibition applies to both professional and personal conduct. A judge must expect to be the subject of constant public scrutiny and accept freely and willingly restrictions that might be viewed as burdensome by the ordinary citizen. Because it is not practicable to list all prohibited acts, the prohibition is necessarily cast in general terms that extend to conduct by judges that is harmful although not specifically mentioned in the Code. Actual improprieties under this standard include violations of law, court rules, or other specific provisions of this Code. Canon 3: A Judge Should Perform the Duties of the Office Fairly, Impartially and Diligently The duties of judicial office take precedence over all other activities. In performing the duties prescribed by law, the judge should adhere to the following standards: … (C) Disqualification. (1) A judge shall disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances in which: [(a)-(e) list circumstances that would, by example, fall within this category]” Now, assume you are litigating a case, and the judge to which the case is assigned worked in recent years at the firm of your opposing counsel, with your actual opposing counsel, and was supervised there by one of your opposing counsel, and, while at that firm, represented your adversary party, and did so in the same, substantive (and evolving) legal field as that which is involved in your case. If a “reasonable mind” (not necessarily all minds) could conclude that the judge’s impartiality, under those circumstances, would be impaired, “an appearance of impropriety” exists. “Public confidence in the judiciary is eroded by irresponsible or improper conduct by judges. A judge must avoid all impropriety and appearance of impropriety.” What should happen is pretty straight-forward. The judge should either recuse himself or, if he thinks his impartiality would not be impaired, disclose to all counsel all relevant facts, allow them to confer outside his hearing as to whether all parties waive the potential conflict, and then proceed only if all agree in writing that he may continue (see Canon 3D). If these, or similar, rules do not apply to APJs, why not? Ternary April 29, 2017 8:13 pm I have noticed (on this blog and on the “other” blog) that comments and opinions regarding disputable court and PTAB decisions and procedures on validity of patents are sometimes countered with opinions on the quality of an invention. A response may proclaim that the invention is bad, known, well known, very well known, irrelevant, stupid. The implication seems to be that because of the proclaimed lack of quality of an invention, any violation of rules and procedures is fine, because the invention is undeserving of a patent. As a patent owner I would expect that a judge who worked for an opponent in a case would recuse her/himself automatically to prevent even the slightest whiff of corruption. Why is this even a point of discussion? “Normally one dead canary is enough to realize that it’s time to get out of the mine. The floors of PTAB are littered with an entire flock’s worth of dead claims that have been declared invalid….” The rules are sufficiently stacked against patent owners and independent inventors. We really should not add worries about potentially prejudiced judges to that already toxic mix. Great investigative article Steve. Keep them coming. Anon April 30, 2017 10:42 am “The implication seems to be that because of the proclaimed lack of quality of an invention, any violation of rules and procedures is fine, because the invention is undeserving of a patent.” This has been identified as an “Ends justify the Means” approach. Those employing this approach have been routinely put on notice as to the very view that you are expressing here, and those employing this approach have been asked to NOT use such an approach. Nonetheless, that admonition is actively ignored and the fallacious method continues unabated. One can only summarize that those employing such an approach and continuing to do so after notice provided are NOT interested in anything except spreading propaganda. To anonymous of posts 8, 13, and 16: I for one have championed the use of anonymous and pseudonymous posting – even by those whose positions I find unethical and/or reprehensible. But anonymous and pseudonymous posting is not to be confused with the point that Gene made regarding false data in order to post. To that extent, your reply misses the mark, as there is NO “retribution fear” that accompanies such provisions of false data. This site has been the target of purposefully disruptive people, clearly armed with only a script and lacking any actual knowledge of the topics and the system. The use of false data simply is not synonymous with anonymity or pseudonymity. To pretend otherwise is to merely try to enable attacks on what is being discussed here in a (more) civil and (properly) controlled manner. To say that this sight only wants a certain viewpoint is beyond preposterous given the active courting and posting of views antithetical from any “desired narrative.” One should not confuse the tight leash given to spurious or downright incorrect views with any notion that a “echo chamber” is a desired result. The plain fact of the matter is that not all views are indeed equal. Anyone can have an opinion, but if you insist on having an uninformed opinion and you want to post material that is simply not in accord with facts or law, you should not expect to be able to do so when those around you have attempted to inform you. Gene dutifully provides notice to those truly new to posting here. But by attempting to bypass the proper safeguards and falsifying information that is not posted anyway, people – and I know several in particular – seek to avoid the requirement of NOT spreading mere uninformed propaganda. That is not a bug, but a feature of this blog. I too would be indignant as to those who would lecture on “ethics” and simply get the facts wrong on the very controls in place that govern and help to ensure ethics here. I truly do not mind strong emotions or even strong writings. I DO mind those who employ such and who are also unwilling to employ critical thinking on counter points presented. I DO mind those who employ such and who are unwilling to understand the actual facts and law involved in discussion points. I DO mind those who only want to get up on a soapbox, give their opinion, and then do not want to take in any replies to that opinion. I do mind – and mind very much – the difference between monologues and dialogues. I have no use whatsoever of monologues from people who cannot be bothered with understanding the topic upon which they want to monologue about. I am perfectly willing to hear out people in the first instance and gather new viewpoints. But if the person espousing that viewpoint is not going to bother engaging – and I do mean engaging in an inte11ectually honest manner – then I have very little use for that person, and that person deserves a very short leash. As I have noted, this blog has seen quite the amount of evidence of being targeted by “hit-and-run” posters who attempt to abuse the ability to post anonymously and pseudonymously. I will continue to defend the ability to post thusly, no matter the content of the postings, but make no mistake as to why the attempts to post falsely are distinguished and what those differences really mean. If you truly want to engage, then by all means stick around. if you only wanted to monologue, then your absence will be cherished. Anon April 30, 2017 10:48 am Bp @ 17, Your reply is what is not reasonable. Read again my counter at 10 and realize that you are imbibing in a fallacy of “the Ends justify the Means.” Gene Quinn April 30, 2017 11:48 am anonymous- What is consider trolling is coming here and making really ridiculous arguments and then saying that you don’t know why you come here (but you still do) because all the information is hostile, wrong, bad, etc. If everything here is hostile, wrong, bad, etc. why do you or others come? That is why I characterized what you said as trolling. As far as the substance of what you said, you know as well as I do (if you really are an attorney) that is it wholly inappropriate for a judge on any level to participate in a case where a former client is a litigant, period. That is an egregious lapse of judgment. I’ll also note that your comment lacks substance, asks me about what others think of me and doesn’t take issue with the fact that what we report here and in other articles is factually accurate. Funny. I’d love to see you in court. Can’t imagine why you’d sue me, but if you do let’s rock and roll. At least then you wouldn’t be able to remain anonymous in the weeds. -Gene Gene Quinn April 30, 2017 11:50 am Shawn- You say: ” I am happy to point them out and have in the past…” Interesting… last time you did that I went point by point and provided citation after citation to prove that you were wrong. Hardly shocking coming from an infringer shill like yourself who characterizes all patent owners as NPEs and then characterizes all NPEs as patent trolls. You are wrong about pretty much everything you say, so I get you need to deflect and project. -Gene Anon April 30, 2017 1:17 pm Gene, A post with multiple citations (but no hyperlinks) is being bounced with a message of “page has been moved.” Gene Quinn April 30, 2017 3:32 pm Anon- I’m not sure why that is happening.

As a young kid with a burning drive to consume all things Rock 'n’ Roll, be it every last word written in Creem, Crawdaddy, or Rolling Stone, building my record collection at all cost, every image, lyric or liner note till they were secured by genre in my head (I don’t recommend this path, but I think, much like a mole or birthmark, dear reader, you may scoff at my faculties, but I know I am not alone). So, in summer of '73, I took note of a new of a new British band called 10cc. As it turns out, they were hardly naive or new or to the game. Between the four members, they’d penned hits for The Yardbirds, The Hollies, another charted in '66 with "A Groovy Kind of Love” and was in Wayne Fontana’s Mindbenders, minus Wayne, playing in the band in the film To Sir With Love. Another member built his own studio and one spent two nostalgic years with teen idol Neil Sedaka. The four even sent a finished project to The Beatles’ Apple label, to no avail; just the misadventures of four skilled songwriter/producers who were tripping the same wire for better or worse. Yet, their self-titled debut album came out held the enigmatic homage to The King’s Presley’s "Jailhouse Rock," with a Beach Boys-influence, and a nod to the ongoing troubles in Northern Ireland. “Rubber Bullets” went to number one in the U.K. and scratched the surface of the U.S., where the Attica Prison rebellion and other big house catastrophes were still a-smolder. So, I bought the record and was both engaged and confused by the album as a whole, which was clearly clever and skilled, but somehow missing a certain conviction and depth that I was drawn to. They were sardonic but self-conscious, perhaps too smart for their own good; but, this single, with its lead guitar part, tweaked to sound like mice, could not ruin this gem. The sweet bridge soars, it’s where the prison padre is called in to talk to his boys in falsetto on the act of faith to set them free. It then springs back to the rocking (and glamish) shuffle and reports to the coming glory, a sham, the same ol’ story—Well, we don’t understand why they called in the National Guard/When Uncle Sam is the one who belongs in the exercise yard/We all got balls and brains/But some got balls and chains/At the local dance/At the local county jail. This homoerotic thrust one-upped The King and, even though comical, done with a bridge this beautiful … well, you’ll listen again and again. A subject, now, in most every hip-hop commentary, “Rubber Bullets” leaves a stamp unlicked on a letter long since sent.  Tags: 10cc, Billy Sedlmayr, Elvis Presley, Yardbirds, Hollies, Image, Video

Monday, May 1, 2017 A look inside San Jose politics and culture Twitter Facebook San Jose Inside San Jose Inside is made possible through support by: San Jose Inside (http://_/2017/04/21/study-tech-companies-should-move-near-public-transit/) More News Opinion Investigative Reports The Fly Categories News Opinion Investigative Reports The Fly News Study: Tech Companies Should Move Near Public Transit By Jennifer Wadsworth @jennwadsworth / April 21, 2017 27 SPUR cited Samsung's North San Jose office as an example of smart transit-oriented development. Silicon Valley prides itself on innovating products and culture, but the industry’s growth in the Bay Area perpetuates suburban sprawl and drawn-out commutes. That’s according to a new study by SPUR, a local nonprofit that studies urban planning. The report titled “Rethinking the Urban Campus,” found that barely 20 percent of the region’s tech companies lie within a half-mile of public transit. As a result, more than 86 percent of people in Santa Clara County—the most populous and job-rich part of the Bay Area—drive alone to work. “Recent growth is not reshaping the region,” the authors write. “It is reinforcing existing patterns … where most jobs are in auto-dependent places away from rail.” From the 1950s on, low-rise office parks replaced fruit orchards and pastures, turning Santa Clara Valley into the interminable sprawl of the present. “This environment emerged in an era of wide-open spaces, cheap land and easy mobility by car—an era that is long past,” the study notes. “Today that same environment, built for near-term expedience, is expensive, congested and ubiquitous. Nightmarish commutes and soaring home prices are taking a toll on the Bay Area’s prized quality of life, challenging its long-term competitiveness.” Despite policy efforts to cluster jobs near transit hubs, recent development largely takes the same shape of a 20th century corporate campus or cloistered office park surrounded by expansive parking lots. Apple in Cupertino, Facebook in Menlo Park and Google in Mountain View all lie more than three miles from the closest train station. “The result is familiar and disappointing for the region’s performance on transportation, health and environmental measures as consumption of land, car congestion and time wasted in traffic all continue to rise,” the study notes. Though it’s the largest city in the nine-county region, San Jose has added relatively little office space—virtually none of it near train stations. However, the study does cite Samsung’s Silicon Valley headquarters in north San Jose as an example of smart growth. The two 10-story towers with ground-flood shops and cafes sits adjacent to a light rail station on North First Street. “Because Samsung owns the property, it was not subject to the speculative calculus that has prevented many other projects from embracing the urban ideal,” according to the SPUR report. North San Jose overall ranked poorly in terms of walkability, however. With only three transit stops, 84 percent of the 14,500 workers in that area still commute by car alone. With so many tech workers commuting from San Francisco to offices in the South Bay or along the Peninsula, many of the biggest companies offer free shuttles that span the distance or simply ferry people to and from the nearest transit hub. But those private buses get bogged down in traffic, making the train a more convenient alternative. Another option: convince people to relocate. After adding 20,000 hires this spring, Google announced plans to move 6,000 workers from Mountain View to Sunnyvale because of traffic concerns. Like other leading tech companies, Google also rewards employees for ditching their cars. But incentives alone cannot overcome decades of haphazard development. Silicon Valley cities haven’t built enough housing to meet demand. Builders as well as the California Department of Housing and Community Development blame the shortfall on regulations, permitting costs and diminishing public resources. Another challenge is community opposition and legal opposition to more sprawl and increased density. Meanwhile, trains grow increasingly crowded and funding to modernize them remains uncertain. Plans to electrify Caltrain hit a snag when the U.S. Department of Transportation held off on approving federal funding for the upgrade. BART, which connects the Tri-Valley and East Bay to San Francisco, is stretching southward. A station in San Jose’s North Valley is close to complete and two more stops are expected to open by 2026.

The letters went to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, as well as officials in Chicago, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, Miami, Milwaukee and New York.” Mayor Slick Liccardo got his letter yesterday. Gee, where will you get your settlement money for your Police misconduct and shooting??????????????????????????????????????????????/ Jack Slade The Saratoga Renegade Reply Sister_H Apr 21, 2017 @ 11:03 pm Even though many people assume that the federal government’s relationship to the states, counties, and cities is a master to slave relationship, local governments have rights and are not completely subordinate to the feds or the president (who is not a king, but who must obey the laws of the land.) The Constitution does not allow the federal government to dictate how local governments must spend their local tax dollars. We pay for local law enforcement and we cannot be compelled to spend this money on federal law enforcement. My understanding is that local governments may opt to do so, but cannot be required to do it. Reply Smokey Apr 24, 2017 @ 11:43 am Sister_H, Actually, the Constitution does have a say in how local governments spend their tax dollars. For example, if a local Mayor decided to spend the country’s tax money to promote local violations of our country’s laws, the feds could step in and show him the error of his ways. Likewise, the federal government is not obligated to subsidize a local government that excuses foreigners from abiding by our country’s laws. You are not arguing that our local government is automatically entitled to the taxes paid by the law-abiding citizens in the rest of our law-abiding country, are you? Because that would be crazy talk. The next election should be a referendum on the Mayor’s anti-American priorities, don’t you think? If this Mayor is willing to forfeit quite a large annual subsidy on our behalf in order to protect the daily lawbreaking of people who have no right to be here, maybe he should no longer be the Mayor. Maybe he should be behind bars instead. What do you think of that? Reply Empty Gun Apr 21, 2017 @ 11:07 am LOL, Oh Jennifer looks like you didn’t read the master plan 20 years ago. That plan was to tear down those dirty old factories, nice neat business parks and suburban blight and replace it with hi density environmentally friendly housing for the workers that were coming to take all those low paying factory jobs needed buy the new industry that would emerge as soon as there was enough cheap housing. That housing was to be built within 1/4 mile of transportation corridors like freeway, main roads, like El Camino and Capitol Ave and light rail etc. 1/4 mile being the limit people would walk to someplace like work of a shopping mall. 20 years fast forward we have smart phones, smart cars, Amazon, stay at home offices and welfare for those who don’t want to work and free buses for those who do. We have just what the master builder wanted and you’re just now realizing the new socialist enviro Nazi were a bunch idiots. So tear it all down man or build the factories on top of the houses because the new workers don’t want to walk so far. Shouldn’t BART and light rail go to places like all the airports, meet at light rail, Big Rail, and bus stations. Wow who dropped that ball?…………………………………………………………………………………… Same old same old! Reply SanJose1971 Apr 27, 2017 @ 11:47 am Wow–I bet it felt good to have such a nice, cathartic rant! Did you get it all out of your system yet? Or do you want to throw in something about illegal immigrants while you’re at it? Reply Empty Gun Apr 27, 2017 @ 6:42 pm X 1971, You were 4 years old when I was working in those dirty old factories with illegals and immigrants and citizens that were closed down in the eighties that now have high density housing on them and NOW, how I love this, “Employment Development Office”. Formerly know as the “Unemployment Office”. Worse yet we all lost our terrible jobs. I went to those public meetings and was told all those wonderful little government euphemisms I just explained to you because you missed it watching Romper Room and Spongebob. No I’m not through ranting yet! Shall I take you on a tour? Reply sjoutsidethebubble Apr 21, 2017 @ 12:36 pm > Click here to read the SPUR study. Jennifer: Tell SPUR to go to hell and take you off their distribution list for all their stupid studies and press releases. If your want to read stupid studies and press releases from pointy headed know-it-all activists and bureaucrats just visit the fish markets or pet stores at Berkeley or Stanford and check out the fish wrappers or bird cage liners. Reply John Galt Apr 21, 2017 @ 6:37 pm Sure. Great. Wonderful Idealist idea. Make the tech companies build next to transit centers. I’m sure that, in the same way that overpaying the “Arts Community” to paint several electrical boxes around town has transformed San Jose into the world’s most beautiful city, appeasing these tech giants by giving them tax breaks for locating next to transit centers will totally offset the congestion, traffic, and overcrowding that results from our sanctuary city and affordable housing policies and will make a positive, noticeable difference to the average middle class San Josean. Reply Empty Gun Apr 21, 2017 @ 10:55 pm Perhaps we should put beds and showers in our Tech companies then people will be home and at work and never have to leave, or we could outsource all the jobs to India and Mexico then and we could get rid of commuting all together. We could ban cars and everyone would move back to the USA . There I have solved another problem! Reply John Wolfram Apr 22, 2017 @ 2:56 am Lets face it. The entire zoning issue comes down to 2 things. The Leadership group, Rotary, Chamber, rule the roost. The General Plan of San Jose has been corrupted by rezoning applications decided by the highest bidder. Combined with the overwhelming power of the high density housing developers with the Tech industry’s demand for storage of their economic units (formerly known as humans) is what its all about. The irony to me is Mayor Sam in his 1st downtown neighborhood newsletter upon becoming a councilmen lamented that rezoning industrial parcels to housing negatively impacted the City’s revenues. Just look at what is going on and has already occurred on San Carlos Ave. All chances for enhancing that neighborhood have been destroyed. Transit corridors? What a joke. Few new condo-ites use public transit as stated about. Reply sjoutsidethebubble Apr 22, 2017 @ 8:58 am > All chances for enhancing that neighborhood have been destroyed. Transit corridors? What a joke. The reason that “central planning” and “urban planning” never work out is that people, societies and urban design are much, much more complicated than human beings can grasp, no matter how many urban planning degrees you have from MIT or NYU. People and businesses just don’t make the choices that the urban planners NEED them to make for their neat little plans to look like the desktop mockup. It’s the same reason Dr. Frankenstein created a “monster” instead of a decathalete-rocket scientist- brain surgeon. He just didn’t fully understand how everything worked. It’s the same reason people are queasy about genetically modified foods and geo-engineering to stop global warming. Instinct and experience prompt people to ask the question “what could possibly go wrong”, ant the first answer that comes to mind is: “A LOT”. Reply Empty Gun Apr 22, 2017 @ 1:28 pm I suppose we could send them all Sim City and let them work out the problems on that before they screw up millions of dollars of real taxpayer funds. Reply SanJose1971 Apr 27, 2017 @ 12:11 pm Actually, “urban planning” does work. Even if you put it in quotes to make it look suspect. Consider, SJOTB; you must like some city, right? Look into how that city runs, and you will find an urban planning department. I know, you think they’re all a bunch of “pointy-headed elitists”. But the irony is that very argument you’re evoking here–that maybe the world is a more complex place than we give it credit for–might be applied to your own Dunning-Kruger-esque dismissal of a discipline that you so clearly know absolutely nothing about. Reply sjoutsidethebubble Apr 27, 2017 @ 12:48 pm > Actually, “urban planning” does work. You got an “A” on your term paper in Urban Planning School, didn’t you. Reply TAXPAYER Apr 22, 2017 @ 1:20 pm A bit more critical thinking will be refreshing. SJ’s two largest employers (Santa Clara County & Cisco) are served by VTA rail stations, Virtually all large employers offer free shuttle buses to Caltrain & VTA bus & rail, public transit discounts, plus showers & racks for those that bike. The Milpitas Great Mall is served by VTA rail. Yet their parking lots remain full while free Park-N-Ride lots have ample space. Our public transit is sparsely utilized and paratransit vans are rarely occupied. VTA fares cover only about 12 cents of every dollar they spend. Instead of more failed “If We Build It, They Will Come” hucksterism and profligate spending, isn’t it time to do what works? Reply SanJose1971 Apr 27, 2017 @ 11:44 am By your “12 cents on the dollar” metric, VTA works better than roads–what percent of THEIR costs are covered by actual user fees? Reply Smokey Apr 24, 2017 @ 1:03 pm Study: Tech Companies Should Move Near Public Transit The entirely self-serving SPUR ‘study’ was paid for by a few elitist Social Engineers who believe they know better than the free market. Their Social Engineers were flat wrong: public transportation should move near employment, not vice-versa. As usual, they got it backward. If mass transit was such a good idea, it would make much more sense to use buses that could adjust their routes according to changing employment conditions, instead of building extremely expensive rail lines that cannot ever be altered. But without über-expensive trains, how could unions and construction companies cash in? Now we’re saddled with a fixed rail system that employers are expected to conform to, even though the cost is at least 8X higher than the heavily subsidized fares. Light rail will always be operated at a monumental loss. Therefore, wouldn’t the taxpaying public be much better off if we simply abandoned light rail, and used buses instead? The basic but unspoken premise of the self-appointed Social Engineering contingent is that the proletariat (that’s us) must be forced out of our cars. That’s why we have practically unused bike lanes that take up one-third of our city streets, and ridiculous “urban farms” that benefit only a special few, and a bloated VTA run by incompetent bureaucrats who have zero experience in any real world transportation company, and the rest of this horribly expensive, inefficient nonsense that benefits only a few, while burdening the rest of us who are expected to use their ‘human engineered’ crapola. The SPUR “studies” allowed for no real discourse. There was no discussion of any differences of opinion; no other solutions, or any other points of view—even though, as SPUR admits, most people want to drive, and they avoid public transportation. If there were other solutions allowed in this self-serving ‘study’, SPUR’s stupid ideas would go down in flames. That’s why SPUR did not allow any reasonable discussion: because most folks don’t want to use VTA, or any of their other Soviet-style public transportation ‘solutions’. Their one and only ‘solution’ is that the public must be forced into using existing public transportation. But that can be acheived only by allowing one point of view in their study, and effectively censoring all others. To boil it down: 1. Government is force  2. Good ideas do not have to be forced on others  3. Bad ideas should not be forced on others  4. Liberty is necessary for the difference between good ideas and bad ideas to be revealed There was no free discussion, because SPUR’s ‘solution’ cannot withstand scrutiny. They don’t care what the public wants, because their social engineers know what’s best… for the rest of us.

Just makes me want to play Bernard Getts on VTA, NOT! ” Well don’t you feel lucky Punk?” Reply Steve Apr 27, 2017 @ 10:33 am Anybody notice how the Samsung complex features a large multi-storey car park as shown in the illustration. Since everybody going to Samsung is on light rail, what’s it for? Reply SanJose1971 Apr 27, 2017 @ 11:53 am Right. It’s not possible that SOME Samsung workers take the light rail and OTHERS don’t. That level of complexity can’t be grokked by us trolls.

The new building is ten stories tall, with everything you’d imagine for a giant tech company: gym, cafeteria, even “chill zones.” http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/Samsung-Launches-Silicon-Valley-Headquarters-In-San-Jose-329224451.html Here is the official site plan on file at the City Hall: http://imgur.com/a/8rfq8 Max building capacity: 2,000 employees Number of parking spaces: 1,545 1,545 / 2,000 = 77% Potentially up to 77% of workers drive to Samsung Campus on a daily basis. And you still call it TOD project? Reply Kostya Apr 27, 2017 @ 10:44 am “SPUR cited Samsung’s North San Jose office as an example of smart transit-oriented development.” Parking structure that is as big as the office building located on a light rail line with thousands of brand new residential units within one mile radius is indeed a very smart use of land….NOT Reply Cassidy Kidd Apr 27, 2017 @ 11:35 am Yet another reason for companies to stay clear of the Bay Area and for those companies already here to begin their exodus. It wasn’t the tech companies who made this area unlivable, it was the same planners who your article suggests are “experts” on urban growth. Look no further than Palo Alto where they regulated tech companies to the point where many chose to move along. Unfortunately local politicians and undereducated city officials choose to pander to the nonsense of urban growth planners whose meaningless ideas and studies only prove to highlight their ignorance. What a pity! Reply SanJose1971 Apr 27, 2017 @ 11:56 am Oh, great choice of an example. We certainly don’t want to be like Palo Alto. Terrible quality of life there. Which is borne out by their abysmal real estate prices. Reply Cassidy Kidd Apr 27, 2017 @ 6:30 pm Sanjose1971: Guess your idea of paradise revolves around money. Palo Alto’s status has been reduced to a retirement community after the exodus of tech companies. Guess you can tell your friends you paid $2.5 million and got a 2 bedroom house if that makes you feel good about yourself. The tech companies left and they’re not coming back. The same will happen in other Bay Area communities with urban planners leading the way in over regulation. Guess you weren’t around during the dotcom era. Ignorance is bliss! Reply sjoutsidethebubble Apr 27, 2017 @ 6:47 pm > The tech companies left and they’re not coming back. The same will happen in other Bay Area communities with urban planners leading the way in over regulation. 1.) “There’s nothing so mobile as rich people.” 2.) In the age of the internet, “technology” can be done anywhere. 3.) Even software engineers get tired of living in cars and campers.

My bag contains [my] make up kit, hand lotion and hand sanitizer aside from my other personal belongings like wallet and phone. Nothing beats clean hands! I guess a bag must basically contain things that are useful for our daily activities.  What electronic gadgets are you currently using? For my laptop I am using a Macbook and an iPhone for my phone. It’s a fact that Apple products have always have the good quality and more advanced.  What’s inside your closet? Mostly my dresses from different collections are the major stuff inside my closet. I like glamour office attires, which I can also wear for evening events. I am also into shoes and handbags which occupy the most space in my closet. What is your style of clothing? Talking about my style cannot be defined in one corner. We have to be flexible. For me, it depends on the weather and occasion. Living in Dubai you can see me with fit clothes during summer and you can see me with fur during winter and sportswear every morning as I hit the gym or if I am just at home spending my time painting and  when I am with my music,  I  just merely wear my rugged clothes. What clothing brands do you think closely fit your sense of fashion?  I don’t really have a clothing brand in particular, when I shop, I visit every store and find something that fits my body type. My principle is this: If it looks good on you, buy it! No matter what brand it is, as I shop depending on what makes me look good not just the hype.  That would help you boost confidence.  What is your favorite perfume?  Chloé Eu du Parfum, it has a fresh powdery floral scent which makes me feel happy and boost my self-esteem and femininity. What is your favorite brand of shoes?  I both like Louboutin and Valentino.  I invest in a pair of good quality shoes as those brands produce comfortable shoes, more durable and they last longer especially [since] I always love to wear heels so I need to have a good quality pair of shoes. Are you a shopaholic?  Yes, I was before to be honest, but when I started earning from my own sweat, I intended not to, but I treat myself once in a while. We all have to admit that buying something new (new car, new dress, new shoes, new bags) makes us feel great but it’s only passive. For as long as you are not spending beyond your budget, then that’s totally fine!  What inspires or influences you to buy an item? I normally buy stuff for my basic needs or replacing old items but if I see great deals on the stores, I don’t want to miss the opportunity!              What brands do you trust for your skin care? I use SK-II and Shiseido for my face. I am very careful when buying products for my skin especially since I have acne prone skin. That’s why these two brands stand out for me. I also use Nivea shower gel and Nivea Lotion ever since. What is a Branded Pinoy for you? Branded Pinoy for me is someone who has a positive outlook in life. Our brains are wired to find things we are looking for. If you are always cynical or waiting for things to go wrong, then your life will reflect that. On the other hand, having a positive outlook in life will bring you joy and provide you with inspiration when you least expect it.  Facebook Comments Website Comments free pron March 6th, 2017 Reply HL5bYg Pretty!

It needs users that are active and engaged. It needs to know not just which link you’re likely to click, but also what makes you more or less likely to click it. How does Facebook gather that kind of information? By looking at your daily Facebook activity, for one. Analyzing the posts and pages that you like. And by running psychological experiments. Wait, what? Where the Wild Things Are Image Credit: Shaiith via Shutterstock Yes, Facebook has been conducting social experiments on its users. And yes, chances are you’ve involuntarily taken part at some point. Is there a way to know for sure? Not really. But we’ve put together a list of Facebook experiments on users that are now known to the public. Have a look through these and see if anything rings a bell. 1. Massive-Scale Emotional Contagion When: 2012 Number of people involved: 689,003 What happened: Facebook data scientists manipulated the news feeds of almost 690,000 users, showing some of them more positive updates and others more negative ones. All to see how it affected the users’ moods. If there was a week in January 2012 when you were only seeing dead kittens or cute puppies in your feed, you might have been part of the study. The real mood swing, however, happened when the experiment became public Facebook Experiments On Users, Having Sex With Your iPad, And More... [Tech News Digest] Facebook Experiments On Users, Having Sex With Your iPad, And More... [Tech News Digest] Also, The Internet's Own Boy is worth watching, BlackBerry invites us to check our facts, Photoshop Express lands on Windows Phone, binge-watching is bad, and Apple paints the iPhone as an extra parent. Read More . The study was described by the public as “disturbing,” mainly because of the ethics of the experiment. After all, it involved hundreds of thousands of users unknowingly participating in a study that may have made them either happier or more depressed than usual. What Facebook found out: Our emotions can indeed be affected by what we’re exposed to on Facebook. Did Facebook violate your privacy? Many people say that it did. And we’re inclined to agree. Even if this type of manipulation can’t be classified as a privacy violation, it definitely seems unethical. 2. Social Influence in Social Advertising Image Credit: Chinnapong via Shutterstock When: 2011 Number of people involved: 29 million What happened: In this study, Facebook was trying to find out if the ads work better on you if your friends endorse them. They showed the users two different types of ads — with and without endorsements like “Peter Parker liked this” — and then measured how many clicks those got. What Facebook found out: The stronger your bond with a friend is, the more likely you are to click the link. Did Facebook violate your privacy? No. This is the kind of study that you’d expect Facebook conducting to improve their marketing strategies Stop The Spam: You Can Control The Facebook Ads You See [Weekly Facebook Tips] Stop The Spam: You Can Control The Facebook Ads You See [Weekly Facebook Tips] Are you seeing irrelevant ads from Facebook? Here's why Facebook is showing you these ads and what you can do to influence them. Read More . 3. Exploring Requests for Help on Facebook When: Summer 2012 Number of people involved: 20,000 What happened: Facebook researchers singled out status updates with requests in them, like “Can someone recommend a movie for tonight?” or “I need a ride to work tomorrow.” They were interested in those regularly asking for help rather than whether they actually got it. What Facebook found out: Users who have a lot of friends on Facebook but visit the network less often are more likely to ask for help. Did Facebook violate your privacy? No. The updates the researchers analyzed are public ones, hence, no invasion of privacy really. 4. The Spread of Emotion via Facebook When: Some time before 2012 (when it went public) Number of people involved: 151 million What happened: Facebook was trying to find out if your emotional state affects your friends. They looked at one million users’ status updates, both positive and negative, and then looked at the positivity or negativity of the posts of those users’ 150 million friends. What Facebook found out: During the three days of running this study, the researchers found that the friends of the users with positive updates were suppressing their negative posts and vice versa. If you post something positive on Facebook, one out of every 100 friends (who wouldn’t have otherwise, according to the study) will do the same within 3 days. Did Facebook violate your privacy? Could go either way. This study is believed to have led to the big emotion manipulation experiment mentioned earlier in the article. 5. Self-Censorship on Facebook Image Credit: Igorstevanovic via Shutterstock When: July 2012 Number of people involved: Almost 4 million What happened: Facebook tracked every entry of more than five characters that didn’t get posted within 10 minutes. What Facebook found out: 71 percent of the users “self-censored,” drafting comments that they never posted. Many others edited their posts before sending them out to the social network. Did Facebook violate your privacy? Probably. The fact that Facebook has a record of not just what you post, but also what you don’t post, is at the very least disturbing.

Read More  can help find out what other similar things Facebook might know about you. 6. Selection Effects in Online Sharing When: Two months in 2012 Number of people involved: Over 1 million What happened: The main purpose of this study was to find out whether broadcasting your intention to buy something will have an effect on your friends’ buying interests. Facebook offered special deals, like free items, to certain users. If you accepted an offer, it would either be auto-shared so all your friends could see it or you’d be given a choice in the matter. The second group got a button they could click to choose whether they want their offers broadcasted. What Facebook found out: More offers get claimed when everyone in your friends list gets to see them. Did Facebook violate your privacy? Yes. Auto-sharing is invasive and frankly creepy. The study’s results show that only 23 percent of the users who had the choice decided to share it. 7. The Role of Social Networks in Information Diffusion When: Summer and Fall 2010 Number of people involved: 253 million (half of all Facebook users at the time) What happened: In order to find out how information spreads on Facebook, researchers randomly assigned 75 million URLs a “share” or “no-share” status. The links included anything from news articles to job offers. Those with the “no-share” status wouldn’t appear in your friends’ news feeds at all. Facebook wanted to know if the censored information would still find a way to the surface. What Facebook found out: Big surprise: users are more likely to spread the information that they see their friends sharing. Also, according to the study, your distant friends are more likely to expose you to new information than your close friends. Did Facebook violate your privacy? Definitely. Just imagine how much information Facebook deliberately censored by Facebook during this study. Hopefully it was nothing important. And the fact that they very closely tracked and monitored what you posted and how it affected your friends seems dubiously ethical as well. 8. Social Influence and Political Mobilization Image Credit: Icemanj via Shutterstock When: U.S. midterm elections of 2010 Number of people involved: 61 million What happened: In 2010, just before the midterm elections, Facebook researchers planted an “I voted” button at the top of the users’ news feeds, along with the information about their polling place. You could also see the names of your friends who had clicked the button. The researchers then checked public voting records to see which of the subjects actually voted. What Facebook found out: Can Facebook encourage people to vote? It appears so. Users were more likely to click the “I Voted” button if they saw their friends’ names next to it. Researchers found that people who got the “I Voted” message in their News Feed were 0.39 percent more likely to have actually voted. Those seem like small percentages, but with the number of people involved in the experiment, that makes 340,000 possible votes that may not have otherwise happened. Did Facebook violate your privacy? Maybe not, but it seems highly unethical. This one could have potentially caused an electoral swing if the button was displayed only to select groups. And none of the users realized that they were part of this experiment or that Facebook would look up their names in voting records. Important Conclusions Image Credit: Den Rise via Shutterstock Can Facebook get away with this? Yes. Facebook doesn’t need you to sign consent forms, as you’ve already agreed to the site’s data policy when you created your account. A more important question is, what can you do to protect yourself and your privacy Keep Your Facebook Chats Secure With Encryption Keep Your Facebook Chats Secure With Encryption Facebook wants to take your personal messages and use them as a way to target you with more advertising.

(View our Privacy Policy) Hacker's theft of new season of 'Orange Is the New Black' portends a TV crisis McClatchy Washington Bureau (TNS) McClatchyTribune Sunday, April 30, 2017 6:56pm Print 0 My Edition I want to see more articles tagged I'm already following articles tagged Orange Is the New Black’s fifth season has made its way onto a file-sharing website ahead of its June 9 premiere date. WASHINGTON — After stealing and releasing 10 episodes of the fifth season of the Netflix series Orange Is the New Black a month before its planned premiere, a hacking group is threatening to release shows by four other networks unless the networks pay a ransom. Related News/Archive New Port Richey aims to curb shopping cart thefts 7 Months Ago New black museum prepared to deal with visitors' emotions (w/video) 7 Months Ago Guest lineups for the Sunday TV news shows 8 Months Ago The future is being hacked, and there's no certainty where it might end. Hackers can steal an ever-growing number of secrets. If they can steal unreleased television shows, could they also spoil the Oscar ceremony by stealing and threatening to reveal the winners ahead of time? How about announcements of Nobel prizes? Or product launches from Apple and Tesla? Some people don't want to wait for staged announcements designed for collective suspense. Hackers seek to profit from that desire. For better or worse, they steal — and reveal — the future. A previously unknown entity calling itself "thedarkoverlord" announced Saturday on Twitter that it had released the Orange Is the New Black episodes on the popular file-sharing site Pirate Bay because Netflix refused to pay a ransom. Netflix said the matter was in the hands of "the appropriate law enforcement authorities." The hacking group hinted that its work was only beginning. "Oh, what fun we're all going to have. We're not playing any games anymore," it said in a Twitter post. The hackers said they have unreleased shows from ABC, Fox, National Geographic and IFC and would release them if ransoms were not paid. The Netflix incident began Friday afternoon with a brief Twitter post from the "thedarkoverlord" saying, "Let's try to be a bit more direct, Netflix." The post included a link to a site on Pirate Bay with the first episode of the stolen shows. Saturday morning, nine more episodes were posted. The fifth season of Orange Is the New Black has 13 episodes, but the hackers said they obtained the shows before the final episodes were available. "It didn't have to be this way, Netflix. You're going to lose a lot more money in all of this than what our modest offer was. We're quite ashamed to breathe the same air as you," the hackers said in a statement posted on, then removed from, pastebin.com, a popular site for sharing text. A website that follows developments related to piracy and file-sharing, Torrent Freak, said it had been in touch with the hackers and learned the episodes were stolen from Larson Studios, an audio post-production facility in Hollywood. Larson Studios could not be reached for comment Sunday. Larson Studios also does post-production work on shows like Queen of the South, New Girl, and Chance for Fox 21 Television Studios, Glow from Netflix, Designated Survivor from ABC and Portlandia from IFC. Torrent Freak published excerpts of a "contract" that the hackers sought to have Larson Studios sign in exchange for setting the ransom payment terms. The document called for a payment of 50 bitcoins, which is worth about $66,000. Netflix was scheduled to release the fifth season of Orange Is the New Black on June 9. The hackers did not say which programs from other networks it has obtained.

This guide will help you create your own iPhone ringtones and alerts for free. Apple makes it easy to buy a collection of ringtones and alerts, but if you prefer to make your own ringers and text alerts from movie clips and music, you can do so pretty easily. We’ll assume you have iTunes 10.5 and iOS 5 installed on your computer and on your iPhone. These new ringers can be set to alert you to new calls, texts and other iPhone sounds. How To Create Custom Ringtones and Alerts for the iPhone Find the song or audio clip you want to use. This needs to be a DRM free file. You can use DRM free songs you purchase on iTunes, movie clips you find online and even those you create with your voice. 1. Open up iTunes 2. Find your Song, in this example “santascoming” 3. Right click on it and click on Get Info Click on Get Info to start making a iPhone Alert Tone 4, Click on Options 5. Set the time of your clip. The clip can be no longer than 30 seconds. Choose the length of your iPhone Ringtone 6. Click OK 7. Right click on your song and choose Create ACC version. This makes a shortened version of the clip. Convert your shortened clip to AAC 8. Right click on the new ACC file and choose Show in Finder or Show in Windows Explorer. Rename your iPhone ringtone to .m4r. 9. Copy the file to your Desktop 10. Rename the file, changing the file extension to .m4r Change the file type so iTunes knows this is a ringtone. 11.When prompted, click Use .m4r 12. Remove your converted ACC file from iTunes. (Right Click -> Delete) 13. Double click on the new .m4r file and iTunes will add it as a ringtone. Once you have a Ringtone, iTunes will add this menu. 14. Sync your iPhone with iTunes and make sure you are syncing Ringtones in your iPhone Sync settings. 15. Assign the ringtone or alert in the Settings -> Sounds section of your iPhone. How to choose your new iPhone ringtone. Enjoy your new alerts. Make sure you keep your text alerts short and sweet, otherwise you’ll find yourself back at it in a few days. Even the 9 second clip I created is long for a text alert. If you are on a Mac, you can also create free iPhone ringtones and alerts in Garageband. 119 Responses 10/27/2011 s2c Reply do these same instructions apply for the iPHONE 4G? 03/07/2012 Gottabemobile Reply iPhone 4G doesn’t exist 08/28/2012 BananaCow Reply Although that’s not the specific name, it is the iPhone 4G (4th Generation) 09/26/2012 Slyo Rolan Reply Just wondering iPhone 4G 10/28/2011 Daaneyal Khan Reply I’ve done the above, as I have been doing for year with the previous versions of itunes. For some reason when I double click on the m4r file it doesnt go in to my ringtones folder and I cant seem to add it in there either :( 10/30/2011 Anonymous Reply Have you tried to drag and drop it into iTunes from your desktop? 11/01/2011 Scattered Frog Reply I’m having the same problem as Daaneyal. Specifically, iTunes will only add the m4r as a SONG, even though it says “Ringtone” next to “Kind” in the Summary. Since upgrading to the latest iTunes, creating custom ringtones has been impossible. 11/02/2011 Kobus Strydom Reply Works fine for my iphone 4G on latest itunes. Did you enable sync of ringtones? 01/04/2012 DeniseFelisha Reply how do you enable sync ringtones 01/07/2012 Maytheende Reply When you have your iPhone connected to iTunes, click it. Then you’ll find some tabs. Click on Tones tab, you’ll find sync setting, for all tones or selected. 08/05/2012 bd noir bro u r awesome .. love u… it’s work………. 11/04/2011 Kevin Howe Reply Hi, I have followed all the instructions, managed to sort of get there but its not coming up in my settings on the phone. When i plug the phone into itunes it registers that i have a ringtone but its not in settings??? iphone 4s. 11/22/2011 Mohammed Fuad Reply click at your iphone at the iTunes, then select ringtones tab so there you can select your desired ringtone 03/03/2012 Davross Reply For anyone not seeing the ringtones on their iPhone after converting: don’t use spaces in the ringtones name.  It will appear correctly then.  Good luck. 03/05/2012 Srinibas322 Reply Thanks for your reply. I was scratching my head all the long what’s going wrong. Once I removed the space, it appeared on iPhone4 with iOS 5. 07/27/2012 sanjay Reply i spent full two night just due to the space in ringtone name, finally i got ur valuable tip. Thank u so much 11/07/2011 Miu Reply How come there’s no ‘Ringtones’ in my Library? 04/03/2012 Melfucious Reply  Ringtones or “Tones” as it appears in the Sync page, did not appear for me until I got some ringtones added to the itunes. 11/30/2011 Jefferson5436 Reply ISSUE: I followed all of these steps and I am still not hearing the custom tone when I receive messages. When I get to your step15 (Settings>Sounds>Text Tone) I see 2 categories of tones on my phone: alert tones and ringtones (it’s my understanding that both ringtones and alert tones have the same extension (.m4r)). My custom alert tones that I created following your steps DO APPEAR, but under ringtones. If I select a custom tone I created from within “Settings,” under the ringtones category, I can hear it play and see a check mark by it. But then whenever I receive texts I still only hear the tri-tone alert (even though there is not a check mark next to tri-tone). Note: all of the custom tones I created (8 tones in total) are between 3 and 10 seconds long, and the issue is the same if I were to check any one of them. What is going on and how can this be fixed so I can hear these custom tone when I actually receive texts? Thank you Spec notes: This is an iPhone 3gs and I just updated to iOS-5. Also, my longer custom RINGTONES are about 30 seconds long and those work fine when I receive incoming calls, I have just not been able to hear the custom text alerts. 12/11/2011 Yimechen Reply You need to go to Sound-> Text Tone and select your custom text tone under Ringtones and that should do it. It’s a bit confusing that you should set your tone under Ringtones for your Alerts. 03/11/2012 Aneurysn Reply Had the same problem, this was such an easy solution. Thanks so much! 12/02/2011 S.M. Reply Hey, I have tried to make my custom ringtones for my new iphone4s and I get up to number 10 where I rename with a .m4r after that it is shot to hell nothing, It does not ask me if I want to convert or anything, what am I doing wrong?  s.m. 01/16/2012 Arghmiester Reply I cannot convert it as well… I rename it and it says as a m4a 02/10/2012 Brokent69 Reply Then rename m4a to m4r. double click on file and it imports into itunes in the tones folder. 01/23/2012 Ziz Reply I also can’t get it to change to m4r. What am I missing? The name changes but the extension stays the same. 02/22/2012 Alexandra Irava Reply you cam download a program that converts m4a to m4r from:  http://www.mp3tom4r.net/download/as-iphone-ringtone-maker-428237.exe you will need a serial from: http://syrian-cracker.blogspot.com/2011/06/aiseesoft-iphone-4-ringtone-maker-v3326.html  folow the instruction and the ringtones are ready to be played :-)) 05/17/2013 Bri Reply If you’re using Windows, go to Start>Control Panel>Appearance and Personalization. Click Folder Options. Click on the “View” tab. Uncheck “Hide extensions for known file types.” Click OK. Now you can go back to your desktop and it will let you change it to a .m4r. 12/02/2011 Gelly Reply i managed to sync the ringtone, but it doesnt show up in my settings>sounds ? any suggestions? 12/07/2011 fizzeh Reply I have the same problem as Gelly, I’ve had this problem for some time now, I get to the settings>sounds part an the tone isn’t there. Am I doing something wrong? 12/08/2011 Xmagoon Reply I cant set them as text tones either. no matter how long they are. the ringtones work great though 12/12/2011 Mikasamc Reply i have the same problem.. my custom ringtones work fine under the ringtone category.. but when i get to the text tone part.. i can’t see any of my customed tones.. 12/10/2011 mtbdude Reply I don’t get the Create AAC Version option from iTunes after I make the clip.  Running Windows iTunes v. 10.5.1.4.2. 12/10/2011 D. Reply I had the same problem. I was getting “Create MP3”. Go to your preferences > general > “import settings” next ti When I import a CD > change “MP3 encoder” to “ACC encoder” and now you’ll get Create ACC version.

Works great after one try. Simple and easy instructions 12/15/2011 Randi Judge Reply Thank you so much! Great to know I chose to get an iPhone just in time. I don’t think I could have handled not having custom alert tones. xD 12/17/2011 Babyboo_e16 Reply I have done everything correctly but i don’t see the “Ringtone” icon on iTunes. I just see “Tones” 01/04/2012 DeniseFelisha Reply I have the same problem i can’t seem to get the ringtone onto my phone, it wont sync, is there something that i’m not doing correctly, maybe change the setting of the ringtones on the fone because it does not give me the option on itunes 01/08/2012 felinelovee Reply i cant either im soo disapointed in it maybe i am blonde after all grrrrr 04/03/2012 Melfucious Reply  I’m blond and I had no problem at all… haha 04/03/2012 Melfucious Reply  ….how would we know if you’re doing something incorrectly…we’re not there…and you haven’t said everything you did… ?? 04/03/2012 Melfucious Reply  Tones is it. 12/18/2011 Backlitcanopy Reply I have the same issue as Jefferson5436.  I can set these ringtones as text tones, but do not hear them unless I’m currently using the messages app. It doesn’t give me any sound at all.   If I set a normal text tone, it plays fine when the screen is off, if I’m in the homescreen, or if I’m using another app.  Is there maybe another filename we can change it to besides m4r. ? 01/07/2012 Maytheende Reply I have the same problem. I have successfully created the ringtone, with less than 30 secs. But it won’t sync to the iPhone. I use 3Gs, btw. Please help. I have no problem when I was still using iOS 4.3.5. Thanks in advance. 01/21/2012 Mima Reply SSH peopleeee 01/07/2012 Maytheende Reply I finally can sync the song. It has 12 secs length. 01/07/2012 Maytheende Reply It seems that you have to create a ringtone less than 20 secs. 01/08/2012 Ahnyung91 Reply I followed your instructions and everything worked perfectly. However it seems that the quality of the tone has been sharply degraded compared to the original mp3 file. Is there any way to retain some quality? I found that the bass is severely lacking and the overall sound is “tinny”. Thanks 01/23/2012 Archana Tank Reply it worked perfect!!! thanks a ton :) 01/24/2012 Gaulty1969 Reply How do I copy the file to desktop ? 04/03/2012 Melfucious Reply  I’m assuming you got your question answered by now, but if not… just highlight the file and drag it to your desktop.  what is better, so you don’t clutter your desktop, is create a folder, then drag it into there.  01/24/2012 Pugly1 Reply i have added the ringtone in itunes but when i try to get the ringtone into ringtone sounds on the phone i cannot.  when i click on iphone when in itunes there are no tabs as you say that say tone or ringtone anywere.  where is the tab to sync the ringtone?  i have the ringtone on my phone  but not in ringtone sounds? 01/25/2012 HaremGrrrl Reply Hi!

Probably just a little different on every itunes version. But if you don’t find your newly created ringtones/ alert tones on your iphone, I suggest you adjust the time. Refer to Step 5 again, it should not be longer than 30s. When I adjusted the time, it worked just fine on my iPhone 4s. For text tone, not longer than 3s, i guess. 02/19/2012 Eperre01 Reply this website fill fix the cant convert to m4r from m4a on windows…. http://gnoud.blogspot.com/ 10/09/2012 Peter Kärredal Reply This was My problem and solved solution at the blog, Windows doesn’t Change file extension until the ext is shown for known filetypes. 02/21/2012 Dd Reply make sure you clear out all meta info from the song. this works  02/21/2012 Jeremykting Reply got it to work with both ringtones and texts.  the hiccups were converting the file extensions rather than just renaming the files and syncing the ring tones themselves to the phone through the TONE tab. question though.  when i play my regular songs that i turned into ringtones…the 30 second ringtone conversion supersedes the song so it only plays the segmented clip.  anyone know how to get past this? 02/24/2012 HopeThisHelps Reply When you’re in the GET INFO/OPTIONS window setting your time, there is a selection below the time entry boxes that says “Skip when shuffling” 02/24/2012 NgatiBoy Reply This worked perfect for me (original posting) So following the walk thru steps works as well.  02/24/2012 HopeThisHelps Reply excellent, except double click on .m4r file didn’t automatically do anything, so I drag/dropped the file over LIBRARY on left and it loaded it as ringtone. Then i clicked lower down the list under DEVICES to see it’s listed there too. Then sync phone by clicking on Myname iPhone just below DEVICES, look up at the top of the window to make sure TONES is selected, then choose ALL or SELECTED per your preference. (by the way, on my version it doesn’t list the word RINGTONES, just a bell icon next to TONES in the left nav for both LIBRARY and DEVICES/Myname’s iPhone) 02/25/2012 A tip Reply I had the same problem as a lot of people, when I double clicked on the .m4r file nothing happened. I tried to drag it into iTunes and still nothing… What worked for me was after changing the copy of the file to .m4r, delete the AAC version in iTunes (as instructed). Then before double clicking on the .m4r file, close iTunes down. Then double click on the .m4r file and you should see the file in the “Tones” portion of the library. It worked for me, hope that helps 02/29/2012 Boo BOo Reply I appreciate your easy step by step instructions. I’m usually pretty good with following directions, but for some reason my iphone 4s won’t allow me to sync my ringtones and when I keep trying I get a message saying the song doesn’t exist. What on earth am I doing wrong??? Please, anyone that may be able to assist me with an easy way of getting my ringtones. Tx! 03/09/2012 Christina Reply I have followed all of the instructions and my ringtone appears in my call ringtones, but not my text ringtones. How can I fix this? 03/20/2012 Steve Reply Im running widows 7 im having a problem with changing the file format through renaming how would i fix this 03/20/2012 Jonathan Reply Hi, I followed the steps and everything seemed to work out fine. I assigned one of my new tones to my “text tones” and it everything worked well for about 24 hours. Now when I receive a text the screen lights up but no sound. So I experimented and assigned another custom tone to my text messages and when I receive a text it works. The tone that does not work plays sounds when selected and it even plays when I set the tone to alert me for emails and other alerts. Just not text. I deleted it, did the entire process again and nothing changed. Thinking that the song is corrupt I made a tone using a random piece of the song and it actually worked. Now I am just plain confused. Please help, thank you.  03/23/2012 Jnorman1986 Reply Does this work with iPhone 4s, iOS 5.1, iTunes 10.5??? 03/25/2012 Ziggy Reply No it doesnt work. Apple likes you to buy your ringtones. Only jb iPhones can use custom ringtones 04/06/2012 VelvetFog09 Reply Make sure the file name of your ringtone isn’t overly long. I created a custom one that initially didn’t appear after syncing even though I saw the Ringtone playlist added in iTunes. Saw someone mention you can’t have spaces in the file name, and though perhaps it goes the same with the number of characters you use. After shortening the name and re-syncing I now see the ringtone. Btw mine isn’t jailbroken. 03/27/2012 Christina Lau ♔ Reply This works wonders. Thank you so so much! You saved my life from dying with default ringtones. 03/29/2012 Robbie Reply It is showing all of my custom ringtones in my ringtones folder but only shows a few of them in my settings that i can use for alerts????? 04/06/2012 VelvetFog09 Reply Reminder folks, this process works just fine. If you don’t see the tone you created after syncing check if you either have spaces in the name of the tone you created, or if there are too many characters (long file name). Try shortening it to approx no more than 10 characters, though I’m unsure what the limit is but apparently there is one of some sort. Hope this helps. 04/06/2012 David Salgado Reply Sweet! thank you! 04/07/2012 twimagination.com Reply Just upload your audio file to http://www.Ringer.org and cut it yourself there. 04/18/2012 Esther Reply Trying to convert track and won’t save shortened version.  No + next to price on iTunes.  This method has always been ok with other tracks.  What is going wrong? 05/18/2012 ishwor Reply try iRinger, the best one out there, freeware, easy to create, cuts only 30 secs as required……… http://iringer.en.softonic.com/ 05/22/2012 SLS Reply I was able to sync the .m4r file but it does not show up under the “sounds’ settings.

I got a custom ringtone, and in “sound” I can assign it as my default text tone, but it does not allow me to use it as a custom tone. 10/17/2012 MummaM Reply Thank you so much for these instructions!! I was going crazy trying to work this out for my hubby. These instructions work perfectly for the iPhone 5. Thanks again! 11/14/2012 Susan Reply Using your instructions, I created the ringtone I wanted, so thank you so much, BUT I can’t get my iPhone4 to sync in iTunes. It only shows up as a device in iPhoto. Do I need tech help or is there an easy fix that I’m missing? 11/15/2012 Dee Reply Have just got iPhone 5…first time iPhone user…and can’t believe how STUPID and ANTIQUATED Apple design is with regard to being able to use your own ringtones and text alert tones! On my old Blackberry phones, you simply downloaded your music, clicked on the tone and selected ‘Set as Ringtone’ or Set as Text Alert Tone’. APPLE YOU ARE A BUNCH OF PRATS to make this so impossible and frustrating for your users, whats your problem. Long winded process to create your own ringtone (which I have managed to do, but the time it took was ridiculously slow and unbelievable compared to your competitors), and as to NOT being able to create my own Text Alert Tones, really angry and not impressed. Your own alert tones are CRAP! Do not suit me at all, and I’m totally hacked off that I’m stuck with your stupid system! If I’d known this before I would probably NOT have got an iphone!!!!!! Thought it was the most high tech phone there was….its YEARS BEHIND the rest when it comes to this subject!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 12/27/2012 Olya Grace Reply i still cant get it :/ 12/31/2012 Jungleboy_PG Reply Much easyer way, 4 very easy steps (: 1) download DVDVideoFreeStudio from http://www.freestudio.com and install it 2) choose MP3 & Audio option, Free Audio Converter 3) put in any file what do you want and choose m4r out extension and convert it 4) put that file in iTunes Tone and from that in your iPhone tones or do it directly to your iPhone tones and VOILA ((: Greetings from Montenegro 12/31/2012 Jungleboy_PG Reply Sorry, one mistake: 1) download DVDVideoFreeStudio from http://www.dvdvideo soft.com and install it – that is correct address for download. 02/10/2013 Hiba Reply Thanks a lot for the steps! :) I got stuck, because I could select the custom alert to be my new alert sound and I could hear it play when I clicked it, but if someone actually texted me I’d hear no sound. I restarted the phone and it solved the problem. Made me want to kick myself in the head. iPhone 4 w/ iOS 6.1 02/14/2013 Choice Reply Nice One!!! i tried it once and it worked!!!! 02/23/2013 donald duck Reply This method does not work as described, will lose your itunes tracks 03/18/2013 Sampom Reply Thank you! 04/14/2013 Elno Reply I followed everything you said but it didnt work!!! 05/03/2013 Nadeem Ali Reply its not working 05/23/2013 ahern Reply I’m in tears.
