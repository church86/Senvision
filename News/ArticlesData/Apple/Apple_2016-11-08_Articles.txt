If you're like many people, you have thousands of photos on your phone, long forgotten after you've posted a few on Instagram or Facebook. They don't have to stay forgotten. Apple and Google are both applying a form of artificial intelligence called "machine learning'' to organise your pictures and video - and along the way, help you rediscover last year's holiday, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. Apple's tools are part of last month's iOS 10 system update for iPhones and iPads. The Google Photos app for Apple and Android devices has a digital assistant to automatically organise these memories - and Google has signalled that it will only get smarter.  Here's a look at how they take you down memory lane: APPLE'S MEMORIES Apple's new Memories feature automatically generates video highlights around a theme, such as a trip or birthday party. Individual photos and snippets from video are chosen for you, as is the music, though you can change it to reflect a different mood. This isn't just a slideshow. There's slow zooming and panning, reminiscent of Ken Burns historical documentaries. Some of the photos also come to life, at least on newer iPhones that automatically take three seconds of video with every photo. When you're ready to share, the app creates a standard movie file - so it works on Windows and Android devices, too. Apple offers up to three new Memories a day. You can create more based on photos you add to an album and generate new automated ones by scrolling down to "Related". You can also add or delete images within Memories - in my experience, a few included mundane screenshots I had to get rid of. Nothing will ever replace the human touch. But let's face it, even though I keep meaning to organise my photos, I never find the time. The machine-generated selections aren't necessarily ones I'd choose myself, but with a small amount of tweaking, they're presentable and will tide me over until I get around to catching up manually ... someday. Ad Feedback GOOGLE'S ASSISTANT Google Photos has been at this longer and offers more types of packages. With collages, Google combines smaller versions of several shots into one layout. Animations combine a bunch of photos taken in succession so that they resemble as a moving image. Unlike typical "GIF'' animation files, Google applies its magic to align successive shots, so buildings and bridges look steady - without the shake common with handheld video. Google also offers albums and video highlights, though without the Ken Burns effect. Google's Assistant generates much of this for you automatically. You can edit auto-generated albums and video highlights, but not collages or animation - although you can create your own from scratch. (That does defeat the purpose of letting the robots do the work, though.) Sharing is easy and doesn't require recipients to have Google Photos. The results vary in quality. I tend to take several shots of the same subject, just in case some are blurry. Yet I get collages and animations out of those repetitive shots. The albums and video highlights I got are grouped by location and date, though Google says it will be doing more with themes , such as following a kid growing up. Most of my computer-generated creations are animations and collages. As with Apple, Google's choices aren't necessarily ones I'd make, if only I had the time. But some are good enough that I look forward to alerts for new ones to check out. I also enjoyed a feature called "Rediscover this day". Google will automatically create collages from shots taken on a day, say, two years ago.  SEARCHING Apple and Google are both getting better at image recognition. Apple's version tends to be more conservative. While Apple found four photos in a search for fireworks, Google found dozens. Google also found more photos with hats, though one was actually a strange hairdo and a few were of a headband. Then again, Apple thought an illustration of a hut was a hat. Google is also bolder with face recognition. Its technology is smart enough to recognise the same child at 2 months and 6 years, while Apple often separates the same child into multiple identities (you can merge them, and things will be fine after that). Google has an edge over Apple in part because it taps its powerful servers to process photos. Apple leaves all the machine thinking to your device as a privacy measure. But Apple says it also favours being right more than complete to reduce the work people need to do to fix things. STORAGE To free up space, both services will automatically clear photos from your phone after uploading them to the internet, once you activate the option. You still have a lower-resolution version on the device and can get the sharper image anytime, as long as you're online. Google Photos offers unlimited online storage of photos at up to 16MP and videos at 1080p high definition - good enough for most people. It will compress larger photos, or you can store the original and have it count toward your Google Drive limit, which starts at 15GB for free. Apple's iCloud Photo Library requires paying once you exceed 5GB, which is enough for a few thousand photos.  - AP Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next Apps story: Drowning in a sea of messaging apps Technology Homepage technology headlines Twitter to thwart cyber-bullying Live: 7.5 New Zealand quake Sleeping woman burnt by iPhone PS4 Pro: Hands on review An optimist on the future of energy Consumer drone market slumps Review: Watch Dogs 2 Where did you go Kendall?

National World Business Tech Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Profile Settings Sign Out technology Search Digital Living Gadgets Games Social Networking Apps Apple out of touch with both fans and average consumers TROY WOLVERTON Last updated 09:40, November 10 2016 Reuters Many potential customers have criticised Apple's new computers for being underpowered in terms of their graphics processors and the amount of memory they can support. OPINION: Apple is looking more and more like it's lost its way. Revenue and earnings are falling. Sales of all its major products are in decline. Numerous individual products are getting long in the tooth, waiting years for updates. Even for products that are getting refreshed, the updates are underwhelming. Some of this might be understandable if the company were focusing on new products that will likely pay off big in the future. But the last new product the company launched - Apple Watch - looks increasingly like a dud. Apple's long-baking TV project has amounted to nothing; the company's never released either an Apple-branded television or TV service. And, with every new report that comes out, the company's "Titan" car project looks more and more like an expensive debacle. Apple established itself as the premium brand, the one everyone envied, with an enthusiastic customer base. READ MORE:  * Laptops just got frighteningly expensive * Microsoft unveils new desktop computer  * Review: MacBook Pro * Apple refreshes Mac lineup  Under Steve Jobs, it made a concerted effort to reach out to new customers with lower priced products such as the iPod shuffle or the Mac Mini. Those worked the same way that an entry-level Mercedes does - they get people in the door and attached to the brand. Now it seems to have lost touch, and others are passing it by. Windows laptop makers like Razer recently have been releasing the kind of high-powered but elegantly designed machines that we used to expect from Apple. Microsoft just showed off an innovative touchscreen all-in-one desktop computer that's clearly targeted at the kind of creative professionals who have been loyal to Apple for years. Reuters During a conference call with financial analysts, chief executive Tim Cook bristled at some pointed questions about the company's strategy and direction. And Google, Roku and Amazon are offering digital streaming devices that not only cost less than Apple TV, they support new standards like 4K and high-dynamic range video that it doesn't. During a conference call with financial analysts last month after Apple reported its latest quarterly results, chief executive Tim Cook bristled at some pointed questions from Steve Milunovich, an analyst with UBS, about the company's strategy and direction. "We have the strongest pipeline that we've ever had and we're really confident about the things in it, but as usual, we're not going to talk about what's in it," Cook said. ​When pressed by Milunovich about whether the company had a "strong sense" of how the technology market was changing and how quickly it could respond to those changes, Cook answered curtly: "We have a strong sense of where things go, and we're very agile to shift as we need to." Despite Cook's assertions, Apple, the company that always seemed to know what consumers would want before they knew it themselves, is now making products that may seem cool in Cupertino but don't offer what customers want and are priced beyond what most can afford. "Apple no longer makes anything I care to buy," Seth Lewin, a self-described longtime Apple customer, posted in a comment on a tech blog. "Apple could care less what its customers think or say or want, it seems." Reuters Apple's new iPhones don't have a headphone jack which has irked some fans. We got a glimpse of this last year when Apple rolled out the new Macbook, a laptop that's both costly, at least for its target audience of consumers, and crippled. The US$1300 computer comes with an uncomfortably thin keyboard that's painful to type on and only one port that you can use to plug in things like external drives. You'll almost certainly have to buy some adapters for the computer, because that one port is so new that almost no devices support it yet. Oh, and if the computer's running out of power, you could be in a fix; you have to plug in its charger to the same port. We got another glimpse of Apple's cluelessness more recently when it unveiled the new iPhone, a device that was difficult to distinguish from last year's model, yet still priced the same. Ad Feedback One of the few clear differences: Apple in the new model removed the headphone jack, a decision basically no-one was calling for. It's a move that ticked off many users, worried others - and promised to make many folks' lives more difficult by making it that harder to connect the iPhone to older audio equipment. But the company's recent press event may be the best indication of how out of touch it is these days. In the past, Apple has used such events to refresh its Mac lineup, roll out new iPads or update its Apple TV streaming device. With many of its products in those categories a year or more old - and sales falling in nearly all of them, as best we can tell - you might have thought Apple would have updated several at least, particularly its lower-priced, consumer-targeted models. Instead the company updated one product - the MacBook Pro. That computer line was certainly due for an update. But the MacBook Pro is a relatively pricey laptop targeted at professional users, an important but niche audience. Even if Apple scored a direct hit with them, a new MacBook Pro line by itself won't revive Apple's flagging computer sales. The new computers have a cool feature: a touch sensitive bar called the Touch Bar that will display different buttons and features depending on what program is being used. But right now, the Touch Bar is only available on models that start at US$1800, a pricey sum even for professionals. And even as Apple was adding the new Touch Bar, it was taking away or excluding features that professional want and need. Many potential customers criticised the new computers for being underpowered in terms of their graphics processors and the amount of memory they can support. Others hated the fact that the new computers, like the Macbook before them, only have USB-C ports, which means they'd have to buy lots of dongles to attach their older hard drives, external monitors, cameras and the like. Unlike the older MacBook Pro models, the new ones won't have an SD card slot, so users will have to have another dongle to upload photos and videos saved to one. The take of Michael Tsai, a Mac developer, was typical of Apple's core fans. "I was really disappointed with today's Apple event," wrote Tsai on his blog. "It seems like Apple has either lost its way, that it has lost touch with what (some of) its customers want, or that it simply doesn't care about those customers." And, let's be clear, this backlash was against a product that Apple had actually revamped and had, based on its recent standards, been updating regularly. Other products - and their fans - haven't been so lucky. It would be one thing if the rest of the market were standing still or if Apple's products were so far beyond the competition that the company could afford to stand pat or if the company's sales were continuing to grow gangbusters despite its neglect. But none of those things is true. And that's not to mention all the new markets from smart home products to virtual and augmented reality that Apple is basically ignoring. But, hey, that Touch Bar sure looks neat. I just hope Apple executives aren't shocked when it doesn't spark a rebound for the company.  - MCT Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next Gadgets story: GoPro plummets after recalling 2500 of its new Karma drones Technology Homepage Comments technology headlines Twitter to thwart cyber-bullying Live: 7.5 New Zealand quake Sleeping woman burnt by iPhone PS4 Pro: Hands on review An optimist on the future of energy Consumer drone market slumps Review: Watch Dogs 2 Where did you go Kendall?

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Improvements on the horizon after Measure A’s big win Wednesday Nov 9, 2016 at 3:38 PM Nov 9, 2016 at 3:38 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — One day after nearly 17,000 voters passed a tax measure designed to bolster fire services in the town, the district’s chief vowed that the promise of reopened stations is now on the horizon. Apple Valley Fire Protection District Chief Sid Hultquist told the Daily Press he was humbled and overwhelmed by the support behind Measure A, which voters passed by a wide margin, and said the reopening of two closed fire stations is “going to happen.” “We are going to reopen the Jess Ranch and Yucca Loma fire stations,” Hultquist said, “and it’s going to create much needed relief to the three open fire stations we have. That is our No. 1 priority.” Revenue generated from the new tax, which indefinitely extends and increases a similar tax passed by voters in 1997, will not be available until next July, according to Hultquist, who said the district will work toward preparing for those reopenings in the interim. “In the next few board meetings,” he said, “the district will be working to put together a staffing plan along with timelines with the logistics needed to open those fire stations, which means we’ll be recruiting new firefighters. It’s going to take a little bit of time to get the firefighters and paramedics needed to open those fire stations, but I’m committed to that, and we’re going to start on it right away.” Final unofficial election results released by San Bernardino County show that 16,916 voters said yes to Measure A, accounting for nearly 77 percent of the total vote. “Almost 77 percent said volumes about what the Apple Valley Fire Protection District is doing in our community,” Hultquist said. “We are eternally grateful and thankful. We don’t take that support lightly.” In 1997, nearly 69 percent of voters — 5,531 total votes — passed Measure V, a 20-year tax that’s sunsetting in 2017. The revenue generated from that tax accounted for approximately 30 percent of the district’s revenue, but the Great Recession led to budget cuts that ultimately resulted in the closure of the Jess Ranch — Station 337 — just a few years after it opened in 2007, according to a previous Daily Press report. Yucca Loma — Station 336 — followed suit not long after in 2011 despite attempts to staff that station on a part-time basis. In 2014, Measure G — which would’ve extended current tax funding from Nov. 4, 2017, to June 30, 2034 — was narrowly defeated by voters. Like Measure A, Measure G needed a two-thirds majority vote to pass, but received just over 59 percent approval from about 9,000 voters served by the district. Doug Qualls, former AVFPD fire chief and Measure A’s principal officer, said Tuesday’s crucial win for the district “was not happenstance.” "In 2014, a majority of the people certainly supported (Measure G), but it didn’t reach the 67 percent needed to pass,” Qualls said. “In terms of Measure A this year, really it’s the overwhelming majority that recognized that we needed to beef up our public safety, and the message got out.” As a result, Hultquist said he wouldn’t be surprised if people in Hesperia and Victorville could hear the shouts and cheers coming from Measure A headquarters as the first results rolled in on election night. “It was the overwhelming joy in knowing our community supported us,” Hultquist said, “and it was wives and children knowing that our firefighters have a future. The bottom line is the district hasn’t been able to develop and grow because we had this lingering unseen future as to whether or not we would even continue to exist. That creates a lot of struggles, but now we can move forward.” Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254. Follow him on Twitter @DP_MatthewCabe.

The trouble was, though, there was no way to link to tvOS apps or buy them anywhere other than on your Apple TV. All developers could do was ask potential customers to search for their app on the Apple TV App Store, a cumbersome process that made it difficult to acquire new customers. Apple has been chipping away at the problem all year. In April, it introduced the ability to link to web previews of tvOS apps. The previews didn’t include buttons to buy or download tvOS apps, but it did allow potential customers to read app descriptions and view screenshots. Then in September with tvOS 10, Apple added an automatic downloads option to tvOS. That meant that if a tvOS app was associate with an iOS app, it could be installed automatically on your Apple TV if you bought or downloaded the related iOS app, effectively making the link to the iOS app a proxy for its tvOS counterpart. Apple TV-only apps can be purchased on the iOS App Store and automatically downloaded to your Apple TV. Today, Apple added tvOS apps to its iTunes Link Maker web app and enabled tvOS app purchases on iOS devices, even if the tvOS app is available only on the Apple TV. iTunes Link Maker lets you search for and generate links to iTunes content. tvOS app links generated by the iTunes Link Maker open in iTunes on macOS and the App Store app on iOS where the apps can be purchased or downloaded. If automatic downloads are enabled on your Apple TV, any apps acquired this way should show up on your Apple TV the next time you turn it on. Links generated with the iTunes Link Maker also work with the iTunes Affiliate Linking program. This means that for the first time a customer can click or tap a link and purchase a tvOS app without leaving their Mac or iOS device and have it waiting for them they sit down in front of the TV. This is a welcome change for tvOS-only apps that greatly expands developers’ ability to reach potential customers. The change is not, however, without limits. As of the publication of this article, tvOS apps do not appear to be searchable from the iOS App Store’s Search tab. In addition, tvOS app results are not currently returned when the iTunes Search API is queried, though there seem to have been changes made to the API in anticipation of adding tvOS apps. Notwithstanding those limits, the changes today should help make tvOS-only apps a more viable option for developers. Tags: tvOS Join Now Like MacStories? Become a Member.

Akitio has also published a list of which devices work with the MacBook Pro — and again, it’s not clear why some hardware with the 82 solution work, while others don’t. We have removed the quote from Plugable that implied no devices with the 65982 solution could connect to the new MBPs. Original Story: Well, this is a touch embarrassing. When Apple unveiled its latest MacBook Pro hardware a few weeks back, it declared that USB-C-compatible Thunderbolt 3 ports (and lots of dongles) were the future of the company’s Mac division. We disagreed with that decision, while acknowledging that yes, Apple does have a long history of sunsetting old standards and introducing new ones ahead of the rest of the industry (whether or not this situation is analogous is a topic we discussed). Now, news has surfaced that Apple’s newest MacBook Pro hardware may not be compatible with Thunderbolt 3 peripherals already on the market. First, some context: Thunderbolt 3 is the third iteration of Intel’s Thunderbolt interconnect standard and is the first version of that standard to be physically compatible with USB Type-C connectors. It debuted in early June 2015, and support began shipping with Skylake hardware towards the end of last year. Thunderbolt 3 is used in the external GPU XConnect standard jointly developed by Intel, AMD, and Razer. It’s USB-C compatible (an extremely smart move from Intel) and should be a plug-and-play solution for Apple’s MacBook Pro. After all, Thunderbolt 3 is Thunderbolt 3… right? Apparently, no — not when Apple deploys it. According to peripheral manufacturer Plugable, Intel’s Thunderbolt 3 standard specifically calls for certain TI chips to handle power delivery and alternate mode negotiation. The chip specified by Intel, and used by Plugable (and possibly the entire rest of the industry) is the TPS65982. It’s described by Texas Instruments as: “a stand-alone USB Type-C and power delivery (PD) controller providing cable-plug and orientation detection at the USB Type-C connector. Upon cable detection, the TPS65982 device communicates on the CC wire using the USB PD protocol. After successful USB PD negotiation is complete, the TPS65982 enables the appropriate power path and configures alternate mode settings for internal and (optional) external multiplexers.” According to Plugable, none of its existing hardware currently on the market is compatible with the MacBook Pro because OS X expects all devices to use the second-generation TPS65983 solution. Here’s how the company describes the problem: The version of OS X on the new MacBook Pros (late 2016) will not work with existing Thunderbolt 3 docks and adapters that were certified for Windows prior to the release of the MacBook Pro. These existing devices use first generation of TI USB-C chipset (TPS65982) in combination with Intel’s Thunderbolt 3 chipset (Alpine Ridge). Apple requires the 2nd generation TPS65983 chipset for peripherals to be compatible. Certification of solutions across different device types is still in-progress for this 2nd generation chipset. From the Plugable product line, our dual display graphics adapters for DisplayPort and HDMI (TBT3-DP2X and TBT3-HDMI2X) are affected… We’ve also postponed our TBT3-UD1 Docking Station to update to the TPS65983 chipset and re-certify to make this docking station MacBook-compatible. Our Flagship TBT3-UDV dock with Power Delivery/Charging was already planned to use the next generation controller chip from TI, and will be compatible with the 2016 Thunderbolt 3 MacBooks. Answering compatibility questions We’ve got questions in to Intel about this, but here’s what we know thus far. First, this problem appears to be specific to Thunderbolt 3 peripherals. If you have a Thunderbolt 2 device plugged into a Thunderbolt 3 port via an adapter, it seems to work fine. That limits the amount of hardware likely to be incompatible, since not that many Thunderbolt 3 peripherals have been built yet. The flip side to this, however, is that Apple appears to have asleep at the switch when it comes to the hardware already on the market. It’s one thing to be on the cutting-edge of technology, but declaring that your users are all expected to convert to a new cable standard while simultaneously releasing hardware incompatible with all of the Thunderbolt 3 hardware currently on the market is really, really dumb. What happens to Apple buyers who pulled the trigger on a MacBook Pro and some new Thunderbolt 3 peripherals at the same time? What makes all of this even stranger is that the hardware Apple isn’t supporting isn’t some random Thunderbolt 3 controller made by a third party. These are chips that are part of Intel’s own reference design for Thunderbolt 3 devices. A little digging on TI’s forums turned up several answers, including one from TI employee Brian Berner: “The TPS65983 is a special product for ThunderBolt 3 devices (for example: hard drives, docks, and monitors) that connect to ThunderBolt 3 hosts (such as tablets, notebooks, and workstations.)” That may be true, but Intel’s own release notes for its Thunderbolt 16.2.52.250 driver, released on 9/30, state: ” Added support for TI TPS65983 PD Controller in SW, SDK API and samples.” Other comments from various places in TI suggest that the TI TPS65983 controller wasn’t available until January 2016 at the very earliest. Development support for the chip was still limited to by request only as of April, and the configuration tools TI offers for other chips weren’t available until the very end of March. In short, the bulk of the evidence suggests that full support for the TPS65983 controller has taken 6-10 months to appear and was only recently added to Intel’s own SDKs. It’s also unclear what the actual difference is between the two chips. I’m certain TI is right when it calls the 983 chip a “special product,” but I’ve paged through the data sheets for the 982 and the 983 and found nothing at all to distinguish them. They have identical circuit diagrams, identical layouts, and once you correct for some small variation in verbiage, identical features. How many people are going to be harmed by this? Probably not very many. Thunderbolt 3 is new, the MacBook Pro is new, and new hardware variants will adopt the 983 chip. Nonetheless, this is something Apple could’ve entirely prevented by either supporting the 982 chip in macOS or simply telling people from stage that only new Thunderbolt 3 peripherals would be compatible with the MacBook Pro. But I suppose it was just easier to call the whole thing “courageous” and leave it at that. This isn’t going to put a shine on the new MacBook Pro systems, and it’s an absurd situation all around. The type of controller chip used inside a peripheral interconnect should be of absolutely no regard to anyone looking for a new laptop. Having to juggle which hardware is compatible with which systems when they all support the same standard is absurd. Hopefully Apple will patch support for the TPS65982 chip into macOS.

And in that respect, few are more fearful than Silicon Valley. As we've already noted, Trump has backed a number of positions that go directly against the Valley's interests: from a clampdown on H-1B visas, to proposing tariffs on goods manufactured outside the US, to opposing trade deals. But concerns go far deeper than that. Trump directly and repeatedly attacked both Apple and Amazon. With Apple, he proposed a boycott of Apple products until the iPhone maker agreed to allow a backdoor into its handsets so the FBI could retrieve information, and he singled out the California giant for his proposed trade tariffs, railing against the company's huge manufacturing bases in China. As for Amazon, Trump focused in on CEO Jeff Bezos, seemingly slighted by critical Washington Post coverage of him (Bezos bought the Post in 2013), and argued that Bezos has a "huge antitrust problem because he's controlling so much, Amazon is controlling so much of what they are doing." Attack Trump has repeatedly demonstrated his willingness to go after people and companies that he feels have wronged him, and publicly stated a number of times – including in his victory speech – that he will target those he have been critics of his bid. On Bezos and the Post, Trump said: "He's using the Washington Post, which is peanuts, he's using that for political purposes to save Amazon in terms of taxes and in terms of antitrust." And while Trump has found fame as a successful businessman, he has never touched the tech industry or startup culture, instead working in the traditional field of real estate, as well as a huge branding effort of his own name across industries. As such, Silicon Valley feels that Trump has little or no insight in their business approach. On top of which Trump has held a long persistent belief in a mercantilist economy when nation states protect their own companies from outside forces. That isolationist approach is anathema to tech giants who very success is built on global trade and availability. Perhaps highlighting the feelings of many in the Valley, one notable outburst came on stage at the WebSummit taking place today in Lisbon, Portugal. On the main stage, entrepreneur and angel investor Dave McClure had a full meltdown over the election results. "If you’re not fucking pissed right now, what is wrong with you?" he yelled at attendees - most of whom don't live in the US. "I'm pissed off, I'm sad, I'm ashamed, I'm angry," he ranted. There may be an upside however: Trump has proposed allowing US companies to repatriate the billions of dollars they have stashed overseas by paying just 10 per cent in tax. That would bring a lot of money into the country and undoubtably see big tech share prices jump as a result. Longer term, however, Silicon Valley has much to be wary off from a President Trump. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 61 Comments More from The Register Silicon Valley VCs: We're gonna make California great again – on its own Move over Brexit, this is Calexit 107 Comments British mobile AI 'bot perfecter stalked by Silicon Valley – report Weave.ai rumoured to be AI tech target 6 Comments Euro researchers more loyal and cheaper than Silicon Valley folk Comment DDN hires staff for Paris R&D centre 11 Comments Silicon Valley VCs ranked one to 100 Because nothing says investing like assigning arbitrary numbers Even Silicon Valley rolls its eyes as controversial Zenefits ex-CEO reveals he's back in business Just how far can learning from failure be taken? 3 Comments Australian Greens don't believe Silicon Valley can save the world Election shocker as disruptive meta-disruption comes to Australian politics 30 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

So divided that one state wants to become its own Republic. Susana Victoria Perez (@susana_vp) has more. Buzz60 Donald Trump speaks in New York on Nov. 9, 2016. (Photo: Jim Watson, AFP/Getty Images) SAN FRANCISCO — In his improbable race to the presidency, President-elect Donald Trump treated tech as he did much of the electorate. He trash-talked it in tweets, offering few insights on a $2.9 trillion global industry that's been in overdrive but for which he has no discernible policy. In 140 characters or less, he called for a boycott of Apple when it didn't cave to the FBI's request to hack the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooters. He chided Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos because, he claimed, Amazon didn't pay "fair taxes." And Trump has urged Apple and others to make hardware in the U.S. instead of China to make "America first." USA TODAY Apple's GOP convention snub is tech's latest rift with Trump But Trump has outlined general policies on trade, tax reform, immigration and jobs that could reverberate through the industry and its investors. His hard-line stance against mergers, in particular AT&T-Time Warner, also could weaken the thirst for M&A and IPOs. "We will see far less IPOs and exits in the short term as big tech companies and VCs wait and see what kind of president Trump will be," says Ben Parr, co-founder of Octane AI, a bot-creation start-up in San Francisco. This year is on pace to record the fewest IPOs since 2009, according to market researcher PitchBook. Through three quarters, $7.24 billion was raised for 49 public offerings, down 49% and 48%, respectively, from the same period a year ago. USA TODAY How the tech world reacted to Trump's win Trump has espoused tighter immigration and more American workers, possibly putting a dent in the hiring plans of tech start-ups and dissuading foreign entrepreneurs from establishing operations in the U.S. The H-1B program, a non-immigrant visa program that lets employers temporarily hire foreign workers in specialized jobs, is "threatened," says Mark Goines, vice chairman of Personal Capital, an online financial-advisory firm based in San Francisco. "If we want to keep jobs here, then we have to train engineers here," Goines says. "Trump doesn’t want to impose more programs, so retraining people to become tech workers is critical to restructuring employment in America. It’s not clear if you change the core rules of H-1B that it will actually benefit the American workforce." It is a sensitive topic in tech, where 51% of billion-dollar start-ups in the U.S. were founded by immigrants and 70% of their key hires are from outside the country, according to a non-partisan study on entrepreneurship from the National Foundation for American Policy. Trump’s repeated promise to declare China a manipulator of currency could lead to tariffs of 45% on Chinese imports and 35% on products from Mexico, though some economists expect more modest tariffs. This, in turn, could "negatively" impact the sector, which last year generated a higher percentage of non-U.S. revenues (58% for information technology vs. 44% for S&P 500 companies) than all but the energy sector, according to CFRA Research. Many in Silicon Valley are distressed an economic downturn and drop in funding are inevitable, and that an anti-tech sentiment propagated by Trump against elitists and intellectuals could deepen. USA TODAY What does Trump victory mean for AT&T-Time Warner? "Market turbulence is a concern," says Christopher Mirabile, chairman of Angel Capital Association, an association of more than 13,000 accredited angel investors and 240 angel investor groups based in Overland Park, Kan. It's enough to make tech investors jittery. Shares of Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet and Microsoft dipped on Wednesday. Apple stock was flat. Not everyone is wringing hands over a Trump presidency, however. The Angel Capital Association says a businessperson in the White House could push the Securities and Exchange Commission to reinterpret laws to reduce red tape. His plan to slash the corporate tax rate to 15% from 35% not only is intended to invigorate national businesses but could make the U.S. a more desirable location for multinational companies. Another trade group, one that represents consumer electronics companies, was hopeful the GOP's Congressional wins could help tech companies. "The continued Republican majority in the Senate presents an opportunity for Congress to roll back unnecessary rules, tackle high-skilled immigration reform, reduce patent troll extortion, lower corporate taxes and reduce spending," Gary Shapiro, CEO of Consumer Technology Association, said in a statement. Just don't expect much of a tech presence in a Trump administration. Venture capitalist Peter Thiel was one of the few pro-Trump voices in Silicon Valley. USA TODAY Peter Thiel congratulates Trump: 'We have work to do' The slashing, visceral nature of the campaign — Trump frequently disparaged women, ethnic groups, veterans, those with disabilities and others — elicited a wave of fear and hostility. That's led some to suggest a more radical solution: leaving the U.S. altogether. Shervin Pishevar, co-founder of high-speed tube transportation start-up Hyperloop One, vowed to fund a "legitimate campaign" for California to secede from the United States. Others say maybe it's simply time to relocate their businesses — a decision that's typically governed by worker supply and state tax rates. “I’m a first-generation immigrant who was undocumented back when it was still called 'illegal immigrant,’ and I've never felt this disenfranchised,” says Carlo Almendral, co-founder and CEO of The Data School, which offers corporate training for data science. “I'm taking off and leaving for Canada,” says Alex Konanykhin, a tech serial entrepreneur who runs software firm TransparentBusiness.com. “For aesthetic and business reasons, I refuse to remain in the country ruled by Mr. Trump.” USA TODAY A look at Trump's economic proposals Partisan politics aside, questions linger over the specifics of Trump's policies, both in Silicon Valley and throughout the country. During the run-up to Tuesday's national election, TechNet, a bipartisan organization that represents about 70 tech companies that include Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, reached out to the Trump campaign about its tech policy. It didn't hear back. That's likely to change. "As he brings people into his administration, he will form a (tech) plan," says Todd Thibodeaux, CEO of Computing Technology Industry Association, a non-profit trade association. "It's up in the air on who he will bring in from tech, but he knows people on Wall Street with deep investments in tech."

Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Nov 9, 2016 at 4:27PM Image source: Apple. People are angry and confused right now (and I'm not even talking about the election). There's been unprecedented backlash against Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) over its decision to replace all ports on the new MacBook Pro with USB-C, which is a big ask since it requires Apple's large and loyal base of creative professionals to haul around a handful of dongles as part of their daily workflow. As a testament to the concern, this fan-made parody video has gone viral. Well, the good news is that despite the controversy, demand for Apple's latest and greatest notebooks is soaring. A second opinion We already knew that Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller said that orders for the new MacBook Pro are already higher than any other prior notebook, so that's encouraging. But beyond taking his word for it, it's good to get some third-party data. Slice Intelligence, a third-party analytics company, says that the new MacBook Pro has already garnered over seven times the amount of revenue that the 12-inch MacBook did in April 2015. Put another way, the new MacBook Pro has already generated nearly 80% of all revenue that the 12-inch MacBook has collected since launch, which also dwarfs the PC competition. Image source: Slice Intelligence. Unsurprisingly, there's also a strong correlation among buyers of the new MacBook Pro and early buyers of the first Apple Watch. Early adopters are always happy to try out the newest tech, independent of the form factor. The time is now What we're seeing is a textbook case of a very vocal minority that don't speak for the majority. Relative to the masses, Apple's base of creative professionals is particularly vocal about the newfound inconvenience that they're facing. Considering the fact that there's a meaningful overlap between the media and creative professionals, this voice gets magnified dramatically. What really matters is whether or not Apple has put off the mainstream consumer, which Slice's data suggests it has not. It's true that we're now seeing a blurring of the line between consumer and professional, the same line that Steve Jobs famously demarcated when he came back to Apple. If you were to ignore branding and model names when looking at Apple's laptop lineup, it wouldn't be immediately clear which device is targeted at which segment. This all comes at a time when Apple desperately needs a hit Mac product to reinvigorate Mac unit sales, which have underperformed the already-weak PC market for the past three consecutive quarters, implicitly losing market share in the process. Ignoring the vocal backlash, Apple may very well have produced exactly that. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Both products will soon be available in a color called "Citrus Red," joining other standard color options. Apple's website lists both products as "coming soon" with price points that are the same as standard options. The Beats Solo3 Wireless Headphones in Citrus Red is priced at $299.95, while the Citrus Red Beats Pill+ is priced at $229.95. Apple has a longstanding partnership with the (PRODUCT)RED charity, and all proceeds from the sales of (PRODUCT)RED items go towards the global fight to prevent AIDS and HIV through research and education. Apple often runs (PRODUCT)RED promotions around World Aids Day, coming up in December, in addition to continual (PRODUCT)RED accessory sales. Over the course of a multi-year relationship, Apple has donated upwards of $100 million through (PRODUCT)RED sales. Along with new (PRODUCT)RED options for the Beats Pill+ and the Beats Solo3, Apple also recently debuted urBeats Earphones and Beats Solo 3 Wireless Headphones in an exclusive Ultra Violet color, which is a rich medium purple shade.

National World Business Tech Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Profile Settings Sign Out technology Search Digital Living Gadgets Games Social Networking Apps Apple out of touch with both fans and average consumers TROY WOLVERTON Last updated 09:40, November 10 2016 Reuters Many potential customers have criticised Apple's new computers for being underpowered in terms of their graphics processors and the amount of memory they can support. OPINION: Apple is looking more and more like it's lost its way. Revenue and earnings are falling. Sales of all its major products are in decline. Numerous individual products are getting long in the tooth, waiting years for updates. Even for products that are getting refreshed, the updates are underwhelming. Some of this might be understandable if the company were focusing on new products that will likely pay off big in the future. But the last new product the company launched - Apple Watch - looks increasingly like a dud. Apple's long-baking TV project has amounted to nothing; the company's never released either an Apple-branded television or TV service. And, with every new report that comes out, the company's "Titan" car project looks more and more like an expensive debacle. Apple established itself as the premium brand, the one everyone envied, with an enthusiastic customer base. READ MORE:  * Laptops just got frighteningly expensive * Microsoft unveils new desktop computer  * Review: MacBook Pro * Apple refreshes Mac lineup  Under Steve Jobs, it made a concerted effort to reach out to new customers with lower priced products such as the iPod shuffle or the Mac Mini. Those worked the same way that an entry-level Mercedes does - they get people in the door and attached to the brand. Now it seems to have lost touch, and others are passing it by. Windows laptop makers like Razer recently have been releasing the kind of high-powered but elegantly designed machines that we used to expect from Apple. Microsoft just showed off an innovative touchscreen all-in-one desktop computer that's clearly targeted at the kind of creative professionals who have been loyal to Apple for years. Reuters During a conference call with financial analysts, chief executive Tim Cook bristled at some pointed questions about the company's strategy and direction. And Google, Roku and Amazon are offering digital streaming devices that not only cost less than Apple TV, they support new standards like 4K and high-dynamic range video that it doesn't. During a conference call with financial analysts last month after Apple reported its latest quarterly results, chief executive Tim Cook bristled at some pointed questions from Steve Milunovich, an analyst with UBS, about the company's strategy and direction. "We have the strongest pipeline that we've ever had and we're really confident about the things in it, but as usual, we're not going to talk about what's in it," Cook said. ​When pressed by Milunovich about whether the company had a "strong sense" of how the technology market was changing and how quickly it could respond to those changes, Cook answered curtly: "We have a strong sense of where things go, and we're very agile to shift as we need to." Despite Cook's assertions, Apple, the company that always seemed to know what consumers would want before they knew it themselves, is now making products that may seem cool in Cupertino but don't offer what customers want and are priced beyond what most can afford. "Apple no longer makes anything I care to buy," Seth Lewin, a self-described longtime Apple customer, posted in a comment on a tech blog. "Apple could care less what its customers think or say or want, it seems." Reuters Apple's new iPhones don't have a headphone jack which has irked some fans. We got a glimpse of this last year when Apple rolled out the new Macbook, a laptop that's both costly, at least for its target audience of consumers, and crippled. The US$1300 computer comes with an uncomfortably thin keyboard that's painful to type on and only one port that you can use to plug in things like external drives. You'll almost certainly have to buy some adapters for the computer, because that one port is so new that almost no devices support it yet. Oh, and if the computer's running out of power, you could be in a fix; you have to plug in its charger to the same port. We got another glimpse of Apple's cluelessness more recently when it unveiled the new iPhone, a device that was difficult to distinguish from last year's model, yet still priced the same. Ad Feedback One of the few clear differences: Apple in the new model removed the headphone jack, a decision basically no-one was calling for. It's a move that ticked off many users, worried others - and promised to make many folks' lives more difficult by making it that harder to connect the iPhone to older audio equipment. But the company's recent press event may be the best indication of how out of touch it is these days. In the past, Apple has used such events to refresh its Mac lineup, roll out new iPads or update its Apple TV streaming device. With many of its products in those categories a year or more old - and sales falling in nearly all of them, as best we can tell - you might have thought Apple would have updated several at least, particularly its lower-priced, consumer-targeted models. Instead the company updated one product - the MacBook Pro. That computer line was certainly due for an update. But the MacBook Pro is a relatively pricey laptop targeted at professional users, an important but niche audience. Even if Apple scored a direct hit with them, a new MacBook Pro line by itself won't revive Apple's flagging computer sales. The new computers have a cool feature: a touch sensitive bar called the Touch Bar that will display different buttons and features depending on what program is being used. But right now, the Touch Bar is only available on models that start at US$1800, a pricey sum even for professionals. And even as Apple was adding the new Touch Bar, it was taking away or excluding features that professional want and need. Many potential customers criticised the new computers for being underpowered in terms of their graphics processors and the amount of memory they can support. Others hated the fact that the new computers, like the Macbook before them, only have USB-C ports, which means they'd have to buy lots of dongles to attach their older hard drives, external monitors, cameras and the like. Unlike the older MacBook Pro models, the new ones won't have an SD card slot, so users will have to have another dongle to upload photos and videos saved to one. The take of Michael Tsai, a Mac developer, was typical of Apple's core fans. "I was really disappointed with today's Apple event," wrote Tsai on his blog. "It seems like Apple has either lost its way, that it has lost touch with what (some of) its customers want, or that it simply doesn't care about those customers." And, let's be clear, this backlash was against a product that Apple had actually revamped and had, based on its recent standards, been updating regularly. Other products - and their fans - haven't been so lucky. It would be one thing if the rest of the market were standing still or if Apple's products were so far beyond the competition that the company could afford to stand pat or if the company's sales were continuing to grow gangbusters despite its neglect. But none of those things is true. And that's not to mention all the new markets from smart home products to virtual and augmented reality that Apple is basically ignoring. But, hey, that Touch Bar sure looks neat. I just hope Apple executives aren't shocked when it doesn't spark a rebound for the company.  - MCT Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next Gadgets story: GoPro plummets after recalling 2500 of its new Karma drones Technology Homepage Comments technology headlines Twitter to thwart cyber-bullying Live: 7.5 New Zealand quake Sleeping woman burnt by iPhone PS4 Pro: Hands on review An optimist on the future of energy Consumer drone market slumps Review: Watch Dogs 2 Where did you go Kendall?

It's also been more than two weeks since Apple released macOS Sierra 10.12.1 to the public. Beta testers who have signed up for Apple's beta testing program will receive the macOS Sierra beta through the Software Update mechanism in the Mac App Store. Those who want to be a part of Apple's beta testing program can sign up to participate through the beta testing website, which gives users access to both iOS and macOS Sierra betas. Betas should not be installed on a primary machine due to the potential for instability. In addition to bug fixes and under-the-hood performance improvements, macOS Sierra 10.12.2 introduces support for dozens of new emoji, ranging from those introduced in Unicode 9 to several professions in both male and female genders. Some new emoji include fox face, clown face, selfie, face palm, crossed fingers, owl, shark, eagle, avocado, bacon, croissant, potato, carrot, and more. Apple has also updated the artwork on many existing emoji, adding much more detail.

I am not complaining, just hope the day APFS arrives is sooner than later. Rating: 4 Votes ScooterComputer 5 days ago at 07:28 pm Well said. Given the income and the size of the company and the number of engineers it employs, you have to wonder where the money is going and why the development anything Mac or OS X related has become so seemingly glacial, nor proceeds much beyond version 1. If you're unfamiliar, take a bit of a dive into the history of NeXT. Apple of today has a LOT of the same issues of NeXT of yesteryear, not merely coincidentally. NeXT was FAMOUS for only ever accomplishing 80 percent of what they promised, and then just jumping to something new and letting the old die on the vine. It was so habitual it was a running joke. And it was one of the things that a lot of Apple people who were familiar with NeXT dreaded happening to Apple after Steve Jobs came back and put a lot of NeXT folks in charge; we warned and warned and warned about this, but much of it got swept under the rug because Apple did just enough to keep the fanboys happy. This is what happens when warnings are ignored. The NeXT behavior was so prevalent, that the traditional "80/20 rule"—the Pareto rule—was jokingly referred to with regards to NeXT as the "80/who the f' cares" rule because they'd never EVER seem to fix that last 20% of "polish" that took 80% of the effort. And that was something early Apple prided themselves on, that last 15-20%. This was my experience in higher education in the early 90s; and at the time NeXT was REALLY going after colleges. I had a relative that was in a significant position of power at a very large state university, and Steve Jobs personally courted them trying to get them to buy NeXT… fortunately my relative was on point enough to keep forcing NeXT to meet requirements (or fail to meet them, rather), and this major state university ended up sticking with Apple rather than moving to NeXT (beyond a small number of trial units, NeXT certainly wanted to sell MANY more, but failed miserably). Perhaps ironically, one of the standout issues with NeXT at the time was with the Mail app never quite functioning as promised; Mail in OS X certainly has a heritage. Keep in mind: do a search on "Macintosh Office" (not Microsoft office), a promise that Steve Jobs' Apple made about the Mac in 1985… to this day the closest the Mac ever got was System 7 Pro and AOCE/PowerTalk in 1993. OS X Server is kinda close, but not very coherent, and it changed internals so many times it is ridiculous. That's a LONG time to not deliver. (Windows Server eventually delivered for most people.) Steve Jobs certainly had a "thing", and "finishing" was not a part. He readily admitted he had no interest in the long play, he was always off to "new". No wonder Apple today turned out the way it has. Rating: 3 Votes Porco 6 days ago at 12:07 pm Apple are saying we need a facepalm emoji? Interesting.

Rating: 3 Votes CarlJ 6 days ago at 01:53 pm The best feature of Sierra, APFS (Apple File System) is what I am waiting for. People here complain about little things like emojis but forget that Sierra is one of the most stable OS releases of OS X history, Apple has done an amazing job to get it usable from the first release. I am not complaining, just hope the day APFS arrives is sooner than later. Agreed that Sierra is quite a good release. APFS is not so much a feature of Sierra as an eventual feature of all future Apple operating systems. They've said quite clearly that it won't appear until 2017, and I'm guessing that won't be until WWDC in 2017, so around June (and then only in beta form). Given the seriousness of designing and implementing a new filesystem, which has the potential to literally destroy all of your data in irreversible ways, I hope they take an abundance of time to get it really, really, right, before the first release. Rating: 3 Votes mark-vdw 5 days ago at 02:08 am Which Apps have not been touched in 5 years? Okay, I'll take the bait. First off, I do understand that macOS does get attention from Apple, e.g. they definitely spent a lot of time on Touch Bar, unlocking with Apple Watch, and Apple Pay. But those are motivated by respectively wanting to sell Macbook Pros, Apple Watches, and increasing Apple Pay adoption (for the service revenue and to sell more Apple Watches). But as far as basic feature improvements for basic uses of the Mac, there is a lot of low-hanging fruit that has been hanging there for years. I mainly wish they kept continuously improving the things they released in the past, rather than mostly abandoning them and moving on to the Next Big Thing. That being said, a list of apps I feel Apple has been dragging their feet on for too long... * iTunes (as a media player). For how many years have people been complaining now that iTunes is bloated and needs to be split into a Music app, Podcasts app, Videos app, ... much like on iOS? 7 years? 8? Yet the only improvements Apple does to it is focussed on selling more Apple Music subscriptions. I understand that they need to use their developers wisely, and re-writing iTunes is not going to sell more macs. So from a return-on-investment standpoint, finally fixing iTunes is not a priority for them. But at some point enough has to be enough. Also, handoff of movies / music between devices while continuing playback would be welcome. * iTunes again (as a device manager): linked to the above, iTunes still sort of half fulfills a role as device manager, but in a very half-baked way. Why not move some of that device management functionality to system preferences, or to a seperate "devices" app which could exist on Mac / iOS / iCloud? * Finder. Read some of John Siracusa's old ArsTechnica articles about what he'd like to see in the Finder - those requests are 10 years old and still nowhere near being looked at. Perhaps at some point they will rewrite the Finder in Swift and deliver some extra functionality in the process, but as it stands it seems like Apple decided years ago that anything resembling a File Manager is the wrong approach, and they're keeping the Finder in status quo until they finally figure out what might replace it. * Facetime. People have been asking for group chat and screen sharing for years. This is something iChat used to have. Also, why can we still not sync favorites across devices, or Handover ongoing conversations? Also picture-in-picture facetime while another app is full screen would be welcome. * Calendar. I don't think many Mac users really use the built-in Calendar anymore, replacing it instead by Fantastical, Outlook, or Google Calendar. Compare this to Windows, where everyone I know just uses the built-in Outlook calendar. * Mail. Sure, they've been tweaking it left and right with things like markup, but for basic inbox management it's fallen behind a lot of the more modern mail apps. * Contacts. Okay, not a big app, but basic things like easier group management (also lacking on iOS btw), having VIP contacts on OS level rather than only within Mail, indicating preferred communication method for a contact (e.g. call X by default on Facetime, message Y by default through whatsapp). Also, would like to have be able to better sync contacts between different users (i.e. if I update the phone number for my mom, have that updated on my wife's phone as well). * Reminders. The Reminders app in both iOS and macOS is a joke, left so far behind modern todo list managers that it's not even funny anymore. Adding some basic features would be nice - they deligently update Notes every year, why not Reminders? I really don't get why they treat those two little-but-useful apps so differently. * Time Machine. Time Machine's spacey interface was nice & flashy when it debuted a few years ago, but I don't think they've actually expanded on its capabilities after the initial release. A Time Machine backup to iCloud feature might be nice (assuming it included detailed controls to not backup massive files like movie projects). Encryption would a nice thing to have some native support for, and I've heard that Time Machine and FileVault don't mix well at all. Some other things like spinning down the backup drive outside of the backup times would be nice too. Finally, I also wish it'd let me backup my iPad documents in a similar way, but I guess that'll stay mostly cloud-only. I'm hoping that the advent of APFS will eventually trigger some upgrades to Time Machine. * [B]Photos. [/B]Okay, this was updated recently so not fair to put it on this list. There's things that bother me, mostly the fact that Facetags aren't synced across devices (not in iPhoto, not in Photos, not in the new Photos w/ Machine Learning). The user interface for editing or tagging is getting clunky (why hide all extensions under that awkward "more" button?). And while it's a pretty good app to browse through a large library, i'd say it's still clunky to actually manage those large libraries (e.g. mass updates to geotags, timestamps, facetags, ...). It also doesn't play well with other tools by not embedding the metadata inside the EXIF data of the picture but keeping it in a seperate db - would love for some more interoperability. Also, some more fine-tuned settings about which albums should be shared to which devices (e.g. a screensaver album to be synced to the AppleTV, a Favorites album to keep locally stored on all of the iPhones as part of Optimize Local Storage) would be welcome. Finally, i hope they bring back star ratings instead of favorites, like they did with Music. The fact that 10 photos may be my favorites within a vacation album does not make them my favorites across my 20,000 pic library. * Messages. Again, not fair to add them on this list, I know it's been updated recently. But with the Messages App Store on iOS, it seems like Mac Messages is falling behind - was there really no way to mac iOS Message apps run natively on macOS? I understand AppKit and UIKit are quite different, but for these type of extensions to native apps it sure would be nice if devs could run them cross platform (since a Mac messages app store seems dead on arrival to me). * [B]Podcasts. [/B]This is mostly an iOS gripe, but since macOS could use a podcast app i'll add it in. Apple practically invented podcasting 10 years ago, but they haven't improved the basic features they offer through iTunes since then. Podcast subscriptions, access to older episodes, automatic transcription, easier social sharing, hotlinks to specific points in an episode, better annotation (e.g. URL's appearing at specific points in the episode), ... * iBooks. Launched as a Big Thing in 2010 when they were just launching the iPad, then finally ported to macOS three years later, but hasn't seen any significant updates since. Most people that I know use the Amazon Kindle app instead. * Maps. Slowly getting better, but still a lot of work to do. Indoor maps have been rumored for years, turn-by-turn directions could use improvements, public transit support is limited, flyover is nice but needs more cities, street view, dynamic re-routing in case of traffic accidents, offline maps, ... I also wish they would add a web interface for this one (maps.apple.com?), but I guess that would defeat the point of using the software to sell the hardware. It'd allow them to get more feedback to fix the contents of the maps, though. * Remote. Why is there no Remote app on Mac? Am I the only person who regularly sits on the couch with the laptop, and wouldn't mind being able to control his AppleTV from his laptop? * Health. Again, why is there not Apple Health app on the Mac (or the iPad for that matter)? I understand there are (legal) challenges around syncing the data in an encrypted way, but if you can get data to sync from the Watch to the Phone then surely you can get that data from the Phone to the Mac as well? While the iPhone is nice for entering data, i'd love to have a better Health dashboard on the iPad or the Mac to get a longer term view on how i'm doing. * News. Why no News app on the Mac? (Not that it would matter much to me at this point since Apple News doesn't exist in Belgium yet). I wouldn't mind paying some type of monthly subscription to Apple that got split out into micropayments for certain articles. * And finally... Front Row. Guess you weren't expecting this one :) . Hasn't been updated in 5 years because Apple stopped developing it. But being able to just sit back and use my Mac as a kind of Apple TV was nice (the setup of my living room allows me to watch the Mac on the desk from the couch), and the only reason I can see why they would completely remove that app is to "focus", i.e. look at return on investment of software development and focus on the features that sell more devices. This one would be small but welcome for me.

Sorry to rain on your parade, but all evidence indicates that the APFS you have now is the best you're going to see in Sierra. Apple has stated a release date of late-2017 for the completed article. I'm disappointed too. Rating: 1 Votes Vjosullivan 5 days ago at 01:14 pm ...But as far as basic feature improvements for basic uses of the Mac, there is a lot of low-hanging fruit that has been hanging there for years. I mainly wish they kept continuously improving the things they released in the past, rather than mostly abandoning them and moving on to the Next Big Thing. Well said. Given the income and the size of the company and the number of engineers it employs, you have to wonder where the money is going and why the development anything Mac or OS X related has become so seemingly glacial, nor proceeds much beyond version 1.

November 9 AAPL: 110.88 -0.18 tvOS apps now support direct linking to improve search and sharing for Apple TV Greg Barbosa - 6 days ago @gregbarbosa Apple TV App Store tvOS View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple has published a developer update aimed at making it easier for developers to share direct links to tvOS apps. Originally when developers wanted to share tvOS apps, they would have to instruct users to manually search through the App Store on the Apple TV. Apple’s update today includes an update to the iTunes Link Maker where tvOS apps can now also be searched for and linked to directly. Apple has been slowly rolling out changes to the tvOS App Store over the past year looking to improve the experience overall. Top Charts in the App Store now hide apps you already have installed, and preview videos found their way to the tvOS App Store as well. With App Store categories expanding alongside those changes, Apple was bound to make it easier to download apps onto the TV. Although iOS apps have had the ability to view if apps in the App Store had Apple TV versions or not, users couldn’t explicitly find or download them from their devices. With today’s changes, if a user has automatic app installs enabled on their devices, installing new apps will place them on the Apple TV as well. The update today should make it significantly easier to share Apple TV app links to one another. Universal apps like Twitter that are available on the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and tvOS will share a singular URL for all the devices. When a user clicks this singular URL on their iOS device, they’ll now be shown appropriate screenshots for the iPhone or iPad, and below that the Apple Watch and Apple TV screenshots. Linking to Your tvOS App Product Pages November 9, 2016 Make it easier for customers to view your tvOS apps on the App Store for iPhone and iPad, and on the iTunes Store on Mac and PC with a direct link your app’s product page. Customers who have enabled their Apple TV to automatically install apps can download your app straight to Apple TV from their iOS device or computer. Simply get the link from iTunes Link Maker and use it when promoting your app. Learn more about preparing tvOS apps for the App Store. Apple Developer News and Updates Twitter iOS App Store page Twitter iOS App Store Additional Screenshots Twitter iOS App Store Apple TV Screenshots Twitter iOS App Store Apple TV Screenshots View Apple had launched App Analytics for tvOS a few months ago but at the time developers didn’t have a way to track or easily create links around the web. In combination with iTunes Link Maker and App Analytics, developers can now create links to help track their campaigns and find areas for growth and improvement.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 9, 2016 at 2:17PM In late October, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) unveiled its next-generation MacBook Pro laptops. One interesting feature of these systems is that the company replaced the legacy USB ports with Thunderbolt 3 ports (two on the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro; four on the higher-end 13-inch model with Touch Bar as well as on the 15-inch model). Apple's new MacBook Pro computers use Thunderbolt 3 for connectivity. Image source: Apple.  Per a teardown report from iFixit, the Thunderbolt 3 capability inside of the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro is provided by an Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) JHL6540 Thunderbolt 3 controller. It is likely that the MacBook Pro models sporting four Thunderbolt 3 ports will include two of these controllers, as Intel's specification page for the JHL6540 part says that it only supports two Thunderbolt 3 ports.  In addition to supplying Thunderbolt controllers into Apple's new MacBook Pro systems, Intel also provides the main processors for all current Mac systems.  During Intel's 2015 investor meeting, former Intel PC chief Kirk Skaugen said that the company plans to integrate Thunderbolt into its processors over the "next several years." Let's take a closer look at when we should expect it and what it will mean for Intel and PC makers such as Apple. The implications for Intel Skaugen's comment about Thunderbolt integration came as part of a broader discussion on the reasons that Intel generally integrates functionality previously handled in stand-alone chips into its processors. "We have a history of intelligent integration," Skaugen began. "If you look at audio, Iris graphics, touch controllers, image processing units, sensor hubs, and security, all of these when we integrate we add a little bit to our average selling price, we give a little back to our OEM, and we give a little bit back to the end user." This commentary suggests that when Thunderbolt capability is integrated directly into Intel's future processors, Intel will be able to charge customers more for those processors -- a clear win for Intel. Intel's specification page shows list prices for its Thunderbolt controllers ranging from $6.45 to $8.55. If Thunderbolt integration allows Intel to raise its Core processor average selling prices by just $2 to $3, then Intel could be looking at hundreds of millions of incremental annual revenues. That's not chump change. The implications for personal computer makers Skaugen's comments imply that the cost of a processor with integrated Thunderbolt to a system vendor will be lower than what the cost of an Intel processor coupled with stand-alone Thunderbolt 3 controllers would be. The impact to a company like Apple, which has already gone all-in on Thunderbolt/USB Type C, will likely just be that their systems become a little bit cheaper to build. The savings won't be huge, but most for-profit entities tend to like opportunities to shave off unnecessary costs.  The other system vendors that haven't yet adopted the technology may be compelled to do so once it comes standard with every Intel processor.  Thunderbolt is a marketable technology that offers a significant performance boost over prior-generation USB technology; if some system vendors adopt it, the system vendors that don't could be putting themselves at senseless disadvantages in the marketplace.  Thunderbolt 3 is apparently much faster than prior technologies. Image source: Intel.  Furthermore, if the technology will be integrated into future Intel processors anyway, and if the system vendors are going to pay for those processors whether or not they use Thunderbolt, then why not just implement it?  With a proliferation of systems with Thunderbolt support, it is likely that computer peripheral makers will more aggressively design their products to provide native support for and take full advantage of the standard.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Nov 9, 2016 at 2:20PM Investors didn't react very favorably to Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) latest earnings release, and it's likely that guidance for the coming quarter failed to impress. In this clip from Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and Evan Niu, CFA, discuss the bigger picture and how to interpret the company's forecast. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 28, 2016. Dylan Lewis: In my eyes, pretty solid quarter. They met expectations, they set guidance that put them back on to at least some sort of growth, for at least the next quarter. We had a listener tweet, and I think this is something that probably a lot of people are wondering, you say, "OK, they checked the boxes in a lot of ways. Why are they down 2.5% since they reported?" The initial reaction when you saw iPhone units was positive, and pretty much after that they've fallen off and haven't really recovered. Two and a half percent is nothing to go crazy panicked over, but I think it's a valid question, and it's something a lot of people are wondering. What do you think? Evan Niu: I think it was just kind of in line with expectations. It's always hard to know how the market is going to react. It's not always just about with the actual consensus number is, it's also about the whispered number, which is this abstract concept of what people actually think. That's the way that analysts work. Investors talk up this whispered number, "Oh, this is what I have on my official estimates, but I think they'll probably go lower, or higher." So, it's always hard to gauge what's actually going to happen. Two percent is not a killer move in either direction. I think it was more of just a lack of being impressed, if that makes sense. We talked about the gross margin guide wasn't super great. People just have to start accepting that Apple is just not a growth machine anymore, and that's OK. But some people have trouble with that just because it's kind of boring, for it to not be a growth machine. Lewis: Yeah. And, in fairness, this is a company that has, historically, provided relatively conservative guidance. You almost never see them miss their own guidance marks. They typically meet it or are surprised pretty comfortably. So, to show them projecting growth means they must be pretty confident that that's going to happen. They do have some nice tailwinds to support that, like I said, they have one of the biggest competitors off the market, and they also benefit this quarter from a 14-week Q1 instead of a 13-week Q1. So, that should help them out a little bit, a couple extra selling days there. But, by and large, there's nothing in this report from my end, that really changes my thesis on this company. Niu: They do pretty much always get within their guidance. It's not like the old days, when they would put out this laughably low guidance number, a lowball that you could basically ignore. A few years ago, they changed to really be more honest, to actually give a range that they're pretty confident they'll get within. And, for the most part, they have, every quarter, more or less. I definitely take their guidance at face value these days versus the old days, when you could basically just laugh it off because it was a joke. I think maybe that's another reason why they weren't as impressed. Maybe, like you mentioned, there's an extra week in this quarter. If the revenue growth is because you get an extra week, that doesn't really inspire a lot of confidence in the business. Again, it's not like it's a terrible business. But if you're looking skeptically, you could say, "Oh, you're only going to grow because you had more days to sell in the quarter." Maybe that's another thing people were disappointed in. Lewis: Even then, returning to a flat quarter, in my eyes, is great. We've seen this down trend for such a long time that seeing them get back to, whether it's zero or positive growth, it's pretty fantastic. Dylan Lewis owns shares of Apple.

By Matt Asay | November 9, 2016, 10:07 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: CNET Apple may be the most secretive tech company on the planet, but it's finally starting to open up to open source. While the company has yet to issue its own open source report card, Google style, an Apple software engineer recently noted "at Apple we are doubling down on open source." That's progress, and follows on the heels of the company acknowledging its use of Apache Mesos, as well as updating its open source page to proclaim, "Open source software is at the heart of Apple platforms and developer tools." Is it enough? SEE: Job description: iOS developer (Tech Pro Research) Open is as open does Most of Apple's software isn't open source, of course. From Siri to iOS, Apple keeps most of its code under proprietary lock and key. That's partly legacy, but it's also simply in keeping with how most companies operate, including big open source contributors like Google or Twitter. More about Open Source Open source is not to blame for a lack of industry standards Why Red Hat's OpenShift, not OpenStack, is making waves with developers Subscribe to TechRepublic's Open Source Weekly newsletter Some of this has to do with trying to maintain competitive differentiation, but much of it comes down to effort: It's real, extra work to open source code. Lately, Apple has been warming to more visible involvement in open source projects. Though the company has long used open source software within its proprietary products, it is now starting to contribute back, hosting projects on GitHub and on its own (like Swift). As such, it's impressive to hear Apple's Michael Kjellman open up on Apple's open source ambitions: [A]t Apple we are doubling down on open source. We have tons of code in flight — really big ones in fact — many already out for review. Our list of enhancements we want to do grows all the time so there is no shortage of work to do. Some of that "work to do," as Red Hat's Jason Brooks calls out, could involve less draconian software licensing agreements. However, it's hard to find particular fault in Apple's SLAs, given that SLAs across the industry basically translate to "This software doesn't work and will almost certainly blow up at any moment." Apple's aren't any worse. It's more than code The cynic will argue that Apple is only getting into open source because it has to. In a world fueled by developers, enterprises must speak their language: open source code. As Klint Flinley put it, "[E]ven Apple can only risk alienating the developers on whom it relies for so many third-party apps and services so far. Coders have myriad options available to let them do their jobs the way they want; to keep them in-house, it turns out, Apple has to open up." Finley was referring to Apple's now open source programming language, Swift, but it's true across the board with Apple technology. Apple has proved adept at getting developers to build for its ecosystem (e.g., the App Store), but it will need tighter ties to the developer crowd as it seeks to improve services like Siri that gain resonance as developers extend them (similar to how Amazon's Echo keeps getting better due to third-party integrations). SEE: Apple's Swift programming language: The smart person's guide (TechRepublic) Which brings up a final point: As great as it is that "Apple continues to contribute and release significant quantities of open source code," it's even more important that the company contribute in other ways. As Wes McKinney writes of GitHub, it "overemphasizes the value of commits over the other kinds of important contributions to open source projects, like doing code reviews and discussing bugs and new features on the issue tracker." For me, the most important thing Apple can do is talk about how it uses open source. Apple's taking the stage to talk about Apache Mesos and Siri, for example, is just the sort of thing to lower barriers to entry for less technical enterprises. Developers want to hear from other developers, and the fact that Apple is finally starting to participate in public conversations about open source is a huge step for Apple...and open source.

For those buyers looking for something a little less ubiquitous than the standard aluminium Watch there’s the stainless steel version. Or a version with a posh Hermès strap. Or even the £1250 ceramic Apple Watch Edition. But what if you’re the energetic type and want your Apple Watch to better reflect that? That’s where the Apple Watch Nike+ comes in. In terms of specification this is identical to the standard Apple Watch Series 2, but it does get a couple of Nike-flavoured exclusives in the form of faces and straps. There’s also the new version of the Nike+ Run Club app that, while not actually exclusive to the Nike version of the Watch, is featured as part of the setup, which makes it well worth a look here. How much extra does the dedicated Nike nerd need to fork out for these little tweaks? Absolutely nothing - it costs no more than the entry-level Series 2. The question is whether it’s a free upgrade or a variant to be avoided… Apple Watch Nike+ design: strapped for sport Easily the most striking and most successful element of the Apple Watch Nike+ is its exclusive strap, referred to as the Nike Sport Band. Essentially, this is the standard Sport Band with a load of holes punched through it, which I realise doesn’t exactly sound revolutionary, but the result is a strap that’s even lighter and more comfortable than the already very comfortable standard design. It’s just that little bit stretchier and more flexible, and that means you can wear it just a little bit tighter - that can be a big help for accurate heart rate measurements. If you’d prefer your Apple Watch Nike+ to look a little more subtle than the version I’ve got here, there are three other variants of the strap available. The grey/green version is still fairly attention-grabbing, but the grey/white and black/grey versions both blend in a lot better. And, of course, if you fancy a change at some point you can simply buy a new strap from Apple or a third-party manufacturer, and quickly swap it in. Apple Watch Nike+ exclusive faces As with every version of the Apple Watch, the strap you choose is just the start of the customisation options available to you. At this point there are loads of different watch faces available, and the Nike+ edition of the Watch gets some that aren’t available on any other version. The exclusive options essentially boil down to three basic designs - one digital and two analogue, but each one of those can be customised further by switching between white or Nike Volt (bright green) for many of the elements, and by swapping out the complications. Complications, for the uninitiated, are the little icons dotted around many Apple Watch faces. They’re designed to work as shortcuts to certain apps and in many cases deliver at-a-glance information. The digital Nike+ face, for example, has a column of three round icons to the left of the digital clock that by default represent the Nike+ Run Club app (more detail on which below), the calendar and weather, and a wide badge at the bottom that acts as a shortcut to start a run. These are all complications, and as you can see from the picture above, I’ve swapped some of them so that Apple’s activity rings and my Watch’s battery level are always displayed. The only thing you can’t do is remove the Nike tick, which is the shortcut to the Nike+ Run Club app. Well, you’ve got to expect that really, haven’t you? Even with that concession, I have to say that I’ve found the Nike+ Digital face to be one of the most readable around, so it’s well worth trying out even if you’re not a Nike super-fan. Apple Watch Nike+: the Nike+ Run Club app As mentioned above, the Nike+ Run Club app is not exclusive to the Nike+ version of the Apple Watch, but it has been freshly updated to coincide with the launch of the hardware and you are encouraged to install it as part of the setup process, so it’s worth taking a look at in a bit more detail here. First up (and it’s an obvious one) - Nike+ Run Club is a running app. Unlike Apple’s own Workouts it’s entirely dedicated to pounding pavements and treadmills. It does, however, share one of Workouts’ best features, in that it can utilise the Apple Watch Series 2’s built-in GPS chip so that you can record your runs without the help of your phone. For many people this is a big deal of a feature, and one that other popular fitness apps - such as Strava and Map My Run - don’t yet offer. It’s also a very simple app, and that’s absolutely intentional - the idea is that it gets you started on a run as quickly as possible. Open the app and you’re immediately presented by a big green button labelled ‘Start’. Tap that and you’re given a 3, 2, 1 countdown before your run begins. Too many taps for you? Just say “Hey, Siri, let’s run” into a Nike+ Watch and that countdown begins immediately. Best make sure you’re ready to go. It’s also probably best if you’ve selected the ‘Advanced’ mode before you set off as well, as the default mode only has readouts for distance and time. Even the most undemanding of runners are likely to want to check on their pace and heart rate during a jog, and these are only enabled in Advanced mode. Even then the BPM is a bit small for quick glances and the pace seems a little erratic while you're on the move, but seeing as they don’t make the rest of the info harder to read I’d recommend adding them in. There seem to be a couple of issues in the post-run performance of the app, too. At the time of writing it’s about 24 hours since my last 5km run, and every time I try to check the stats of the run using the Activity tab in the iPhone app I find there are some pieces of info missing, and each time those missing pieces seem to swicth around. At first there were no figures for BPM or elevation, then when I checked back I had an elevation figure but pace was missing. At no point have I logged in to find a full suite of stats. In other words, the new version of the Nike+ Run Club app seems to be pretty buggy right now. That’s not to say there aren’t some good things about the Nike+ Run Club app. Its biggest success is how it motivates you to keep running and keep improving. Just under that big, green Start button on the Watch is a smaller, not green ‘match it’ button, which immediately starts a run that targets the distance or duration of your last run. Or you can swipe right from the main Start screen to get to a page that asks ‘when are we running?’ and offers a list of time slots complete with little icons representing the expected weather at that time. It’s a great way to check for the best time to run and to mentally commit yourself to getting out there and getting on with it. Then there’s the community aspect of the Nike+ Run Club phone app, which offers not only feeds and leaderboards for your friends and the community at large, but also allows you to register for free, paced club runs organised by Nike. Admittedly these club runs are limited to a few cities across the world, but if you’re a Londoner or someone looking for a fun social run while visiting a city abroad (some include a bit of sightseeing, apparently) these are a really neat little added extra. It’s these extra features that make it such a shame that the Nike+ Run Club app has launched with those niggling bugs. Once those have been squashed, though, this should be a very simple, motivating alternative to Apple Workouts that’s especially good for beginners or casual joggers. But remember, you don’t need the Nike+ Apple Watch to get the Run Club app, so it shouldn’t really have an effect on which version of the Apple Watch you buy. Apple Watch Nike+: the verdict You’ll notice I’ve not gone into the general details of the Apple Watch Series 2, and that’s because I’ve already written a pretty exhaustive review of that, which you can check out here: Apple Watch Series 2 review Want the short version? I think the Apple Watch Series 2 is a brilliant device, and the first wearable to really successfully bridge the gap between sports watch and smartwatch. But should you buy the standard edition or the Nike+ version? Seeing as the price is the same, I’d say that if you’re planning on getting all sporty with the Apple Watch the Nike+ version is the one to get, even if you’re not specifically a Nike fan. The exclusive faces are good but not terribly exciting, and the Nike+ Run Club app is available to all Apple Watches. The strap, though, is a real winner. Lighter, more breathable and more flexible, it’s simply more comfortable when working out, regardless of the sport. It’s a fairly minor improvement, for sure, but it’s a minor improvement that costs you no extra money. Now that’s the kind of maths we can all get behind.

Huge salaries, a high concentration of a single industry and a self-referential culture oblivious to how its ideas could do anything but change mankind don't help either. The sight of tech's leaders dining with a Democrat president or rubbing shoulders with bankers and presidents at Davos also contributes to this. The fracas over the Valley's ganging up on billionaire Peter Thiel for backing Donald Trump confirmed this reputation, consolidated by Trump's ability to convince just enough of the US to send him to the Whitehouse. California, home to Silicon Valley, was one of the states to vote for the other "guy". Few residents of that narrow strip south of San Francisco are as well known as Apple and it was they who were held aloft as everything wrong with America. In Trump's view, Apple is emblematic of US manufacturers responsible for killing domestic jobs by buying components made and assembled overseas. The iPad employs chips designed in Britain by ARM, memory from South Korea's Samsung and Japan's Toshiba and Elpida Memory, with assembly by Foxconn in Taiwan. But step back and Trump's economic nationalism extends beyond the obvious target of Apple – it takes in a broad swath of tech firms large and small from "ordinary" US states and places. Over in Trump-friendly Texas, Dell employs Samsung's NAND in its storage devices with Massachusetts-based EMC also employing Sammy's memory. Up in the Hillary-Clinton-supporting northwest, Microsoft uses the Foxconn-like Pegatron in Taiwan to build its Surfaces, which also happen to employ Samsung's SSD. Technology firms across the US, not just Silicon Valley, are plugged into the global sourcing and integration of components. The rise of IoT takes this into newer, smaller devices – no longer just the big stuff of enterprise or the shiny stuff in the hands of consumers. US firms that are part of this global supply chain will pay more in tax. Trump has proposed to tax goods from US companies made abroad and imported with a 35 per cent levy on goods coming from Mexico. He has also talked of a 15 per cent tax on "outsourcing jobs" and an apparent further 20 per cent tax for all imported goods. Trump has also spoken of a new trade deal with South Korea, describing President Obama's existing agreement as "embarrassing" and bad for the US. Trump has put himself forward, too, as his country's deal negotiator in chief. If he is true to his word, US technology that cannot be made or assembled domestically will see its costs going up in the form of increased taxes and new import tariffs. To get around that, firms will need to build infrastructure in the US and take on, presumably, less skilled and more expensive domestic employees. With Brexit in the UK taking down the value of sterling against the dollar we've already seen what happens to US-based technology when prices up. The price is passed on to the consumer, not absorbed by the manufacturer. It's therefore reasonable to expect the price of tech to increase domestically in the long term and for the cost to feed in internationally. There is a "but", however. Donald Trump himself. Given his propensity for verbal pugilism during the presidential campaign, it's difficult to know what words were intended simply to score points and grab the sound bite and which was actual policy in the making. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 108 Comments More from The Register Microsoft Azure sets up shop in France Bonjour, mes fluffy white amis 22 Comments What strange madness is this?

The update is minor enough that it did not warrant a full 10.x.x number change, but it does include an updated build number. iOS 10.1.1 being released today has a build number of 14B150, while the initial iOS 10.1.1 release, which came on October 31, had a build number of 14B100. The new build of iOS 10.1.1 is only available as a download from Apple's servers and cannot be obtained over-the-air at this time for those who have already installed the first version of iOS 10.1.1. The new version of iOS 10.1.1 will likely be provided to those who have yet to install iOS 10.1.1, as it otherwise requires an iTunes connection to obtain. There is no new information in the changelog for the updated build, so it is unclear what minor bug fixes or changes it brings. The first version of iOS 10.1.1 fixed a bug that caused Health data to be unavailable for some users. A minor update, iOS 10.1.1 was released shortly after iOS 10.1, a more significant update that brought a new "Portrait" mode and dozens of bug fixes and feature improvements. Related Roundup: iOS 10 [ 105 comments ] Top Rated Comments (View all) ElRojito 6 days ago at 10:40 am This most likely fixes the problem for users that do not have a screen lock passcode after updating to 10.1.1 being presented a requirement to enter their 4-digit screen lock passcode when they didn't have one set. This has hit two elderly people I know (one with iPhone 5 and one with 5c). It pretty much requires a DFU and a restore from iCloud/iTunes backup to get back running. I'm gonna bet that they're just old and weren't reading the prompts. Rating: 7 Votes pentidoes 6 days ago at 10:42 am How about losing Bluetooth all the time? Fixed?

So another week and another iOS update with the same version number as last weeks but you can't get it over the air... what??.?. Well done Apple, usual iOS quality release there. Uhh because you are not required to update to it. It probably fixes a hiccup in the installation process like 9.2.1 did when they re-released it. If you are on 10.1.1 and everything is working fine, you literally have nothing to worry about and can ignore this. [doublepost=1478720132][/doublepost] Still not seeing the update for my 6s. Is it just for the 7? Anyone update on an older phone? Its not OTA, its iTunes only and its only meant for those still on 10.1. Don't worry about it. Rating: 4 Votes Mlrollin91 6 days ago at 11:02 am WoW! 2,45GB thru iTunes. iPhone 7 Plus. Would be interesting to see what's new. Thats the full installer. I highly doubt you will see a single change. Rating: 3 Votes Morris 6 days ago at 10:55 am My guess is that it fixes a problem that only occurs when updating through iTunes. That is why it is not offered over OTA. If that is the case then there is no difference to the actual OS (and so no updated version number required), only to the installation code. Rating: 3 Votes Xgm541 6 days ago at 10:44 am The build number says Apple fixed/changed 50 things but still keep the version number. I don't think that's how build numbers work, but Icould be wrong. Rating: 3 Votes Mlrollin91 6 days ago at 10:41 am It says it fixes the bug with prevent some people from viewing their health data. Along with some other bugs I am sure but it didn't give details of those. That's what the original 10.1.1 was for.

WSJ's Lee Hawkins explains. By Trisha Thadani Updated Nov. 10, 2016 10:19 a.m. ET Donald Trump’s election victory is seen as a blow to Silicon Valley, putting the presidency in the hands of a vocal critic of several big technology companies and an advocate of policies tech executives have said could hurt the industry’s development. During his campaign, Mr. Trump didn’t offer a specific plan for how he would tackle technology policy—unlike his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, who in June issued a detailed tech platform that executives broadly applauded.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple Apple patents AR maps system for iPhone Apple Apple patents AR maps system for iPhone By Bindu Nair - Nov 9, 2016 While rivals like Google and Microsoft have been going full speed ahead into the world of AR and VR, Apple hasn’t been very active in the scene. Rumor has it that the Cupertino-based brand has been secretly working on augmented reality-based projects, talk which received a significant boost a few months ago when CEO Tim Cook confirmed it was looking into AR. Now a new patent for augmented reality maps has come to light to shed some more clarity on what Apple plans to do with AR. The company was recently granted the patent 6 years after filing it. The system takes advantage of the iPhone’s advanced sensor suite and GPS to present real-time augmented views of a person’s surroundings. This basically means people would be able to see a virtual route on top of a live video feed from their iPhone or other iDevice’s camera when using something like Maps. They may even view street names or points of interest overlaid over the footage. The technology might also tell them if they’re going in the wrong direction with a visual indicator. Also Read: Apple starts selling refurbished iPhones The AR-based system could further pull data from the cloud to perform useful functions like alerting people if they’re going down a one-way street. Apple’s also come up with a neat solution for navigation, allowing iPhone owners to switch between live video and a bird’s-eye view based on device orientation. The AR-centered mapping solution may get integrated as part of a future iOS release if Apple decided to go ahead with it. Prominent analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently claimed that the company could expand its AR plans for mobile to sectors like self-driving cars as well.

Now AI helps you pick out the right Android app Google gets a human hand to help train machines to classify apps by topics to make it easier for users to search for apps with general queries. By Liam Tung | November 9, 2016 -- 14:59 GMT (06:59 PST) | Topic: Artificial Intelligence The vast number of choices on Google's Play Store and Apple's App Store makes finding the right software a challenge for Android and iOS users, as well as for developers. Image: Getty Images Google has developed a neural network to improve the relevance of app search results on Google Play by predicting topics on the basis of each app's name and description. With well over two million apps each on Google's Play Store and Apple's App Store, app discovery remains a challenge for Android and iOS users, as well as for developers. According to Google, about half of the search queries on the Play Store are general topic searches such as 'horror games' or 'selfie apps'. However, for various reasons search has been hindered on each store. Apple and Google have been working to stamp out efforts by developers to game search on each store in a bid to get seen by users. Apple, for example, recently prevented iOS developers from using long app names and irrelevant descriptions to boost discoverability via search. More recently it launched app search ads to help smaller developers stand out. ​Google Play app downloads explode - but money's still with Apple Google may have pulled away from Apple in app downloads, yet iOS continues to outpace Android in purely cash terms. Read More Google offered a similar ad search for apps product last year and recently changed store rules to stop developers using bogus ratings and fraudulent installs to get discovered. Google's latest effort to improve relevance in app search results on the Play Store relies on a deep neural network with a little help from humans, who like their machine counterparts, also needed some training to classify topics for apps. The main goal of the neural network is to automatically predict which search topics should be linked to an app based purely on the app's name and description. Google needed a system that could apply thousands of topics to millions of apps. Finding vast troves of data to train neural networks rarely seems to be a challenge for Google, but when it came to topics for apps on the Play Store, it actually was. So the company's software engineers needed to develop a neural network that could be trained on a lean data diet. "While for some popular topics such as 'social networking' we had many labeled apps to learn from, the majority of topics had only a handful of examples," Google's software engineers explain. "Our challenge was to learn from a very limited number of training examples and scale to millions of apps across thousands of topics, forcing us to adapt our machine-learning techniques." Google says it overcame the shortage by emulating how humans use app descriptions to quickly categorize apps, including ones they've never seen before. The company used several neural networks that when combined were capable of predicting 'share' if presented with the word 'photo'. The design includes a series of app classifiers that link different topics to each app. While the system sufficed at classifying words around popular topics such as 'social networking', it was less adept at smaller topics like 'selfie'. Human app reviewers added a final layer of training by reporting whether they agreed with the system's output. "To evaluate {app, topic} pairs by human raters, we asked them questions of the form, 'To what extent is topic X related to app Y?'. Multiple raters received the same question and independently selected answers on a rating scale to indicate if the topic was 'important' for the app, 'somewhat related', or completely 'off-topic'," Google's engineers said. However, Google found that raters were disagreeing among themselves over which topics were relevant to an app, so Google ended up training the humans too. "Asking raters to choose an explicit reason for their answer from a curated list further improved reliability. Despite the improvements, we sometimes still have to 'agree to disagree' and currently discard answers where raters fail to reach consensus," they noted. Google doesn't say how effective the system is. However, it is good enough for the company to be using it to guide search and discovery on the app store.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Announcement  ⋮  Mobile Apple Has a Refurbished Store That’s Finally Selling iPhones With a Savings Element By Omar Sohail Posted 7 days ago 20Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple has finally introduced a wide range of iPhones for consumers on its refurbished store, thus giving consumers the option to spend less money, while getting a powerful smartphone in return. All iPhones From the Apple Refurbished Store Have Been Stated to Be Tested Thoroughly and Also Come With Extended Warranty If you navigate to the iPhone section where the company has placed special deals for smartphones, you will clearly be able to view the previous generation iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models being offered in a wide range of colors and capacities. The price of an entry-level 16GB iPhone 6s starts at $449, while a 16GB iPhone 6s Plus can be purchased for $529. Keep in mind that the aforementioned prices are actually $100 or so less than brand new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus devices. The 32GB storage variants are priced at $549 for the iPhone 6s and $649 for the iPhone 6s Plus, but they are brand new. Apple states that all refurbished iPhone 6s and 6s Plus models are unlocked and SIM-free, making them fully compatible with all U.S. carriers. This is the time that Apple has offered smartphones aside from iPads and Macs in its refurbished store. Previously, to own a refurbished iPhone, you’d have to search incessantly on different websites, making it an arduous experience indeed. While we will still recommend you to browse other sites to pick the best possible deal for you, at the end of the day, if Apple is offering you a refurbished iPhone, we honestly suggest that you avail the offer. Advertisement The reason for that is simple. According to Apple all refurbished products which also includes the newly added iPhones; they are tested, certified, cleaned, and guaranteed with a one-year warranty. Very rarely do you see warranty being offered on refurbished phones, and these handsets also feature a brand new battery and a fresh outer shell. This is to ensure that there are no scratches or other cosmetic damages visible on any of the smartphones stocked in this section. Apple Could Get Rid Of Its 11-Inch MacBook Air Family For A Much Larger Notebook What do you think of Apple’s approach to introducing used phones to its refurbished online store? Tell us your thoughts right away.

Here is how to install the beta version for users without a developer account.  ( Apple ) Advertisement Apple recently released the second beta for iOS 10.2, an update that introduces several important features and improvements to the company's mobile operating system. The second developer beta version that Apple has released for iOS 10.2 is normally not accessible by regular users, as such versions are meant for developers to give them a head start in developing and tweaking their apps to work with an upcoming iOS update. Often, a public beta is released alongside the developer beta, but because the second beta of iOS 10.2 adds a new app, Apple has held off on launching a public release. Fortunately, for non-developer users who are itching to see what the second beta of iOS 10.2 is all about, there is a way to install the beta version even without an Apple developer account. Install iOS 10.2 Beta 2 With No Developer Account The method to install the second beta of iOS 10.2 without a developer account was revealed by YouTube user iCrackUriDevice. The video shows that users do not even need to connect their iPhone or iPad to a computer. To start the process, users will have to first install the developer beta profile of Apple. The new beta version will automatically be available as an over-the-air update after the installation. What's In iOS 10.2 Beta 2? The biggest addition to the second beta of iOS 10.2 is the new TV app for the iPhone, which is Apple's platform for online video. Through the app, users can browse through all TV shows, movies and videos hosted online through various platforms, though Netflix content is notably excluded. The second beta version also adds a new SOS function, which automatically connects the iOS device with emergency services after five presses on the home button, with the feature to be made available in select countries. The Music app of Apple will also see slight changes to its interface. Other Changes With iOS 10.2 The first beta version of iOS 10.2 revealed that the operating system update will add a Preserve Settings option for the Camera app, which will retain the options that users make when taking pictures, along with a new widget for the Videos app. One of the major additions to iOS 10.2 is the addition of full support for Unicode 9.0, which will expand the choices for emojis in the operating system. Among the emojis to be added along with iOS 10.2 are the facepalm emoji, the shrug emoji and a host of new emojis representing animals and professions.

Many are lost for words and, in such times, a picture - or in this case an emoji - can paint a thousand words. Luckily, Apple has just released the second public beta of its latest iPhone operating system, iOS 10.2, which among other things includes a "facepalm" emoji - how apt! Facepalm is one of the 72 new emoji that were approved by the Unicode Consortium back in June 2016, as part of the Unicode 9.0 update Others include "nauseated face", "wilted flower" and "black heart", all of which might come in handy over the next few days. Unfortunately, as this is a beta release, you can't just download it onto your iPhone. If you want the facepalm and other emoji today, you'll need to register for a developer account. Here's how to do it. You are strongly advised to back-up your device before starting: Go to beta.apple.com on the iPhone or iPad you want to enroll in the beta. Tap on "Sign up". Enter your Apple ID email address and password. Tap "Sign in". Tap "Accept" to agree to the terms and conditions. Once you've registered your account you need to download the iOS 10.2 public beta: Go to beta.apple.com again. Tap the iOS tab. Tap on "Download profile". Tap on "Install" in the upper right corner. Enter your Passcode. Tap on "Install", this time to consent to the beta agreement. Tap on "Install" at the bottom to confirm. Tap on "Restart" to reboot your device. The last stage is to install the iOS 10.2 beta on your device: From your Home screen, tap on Settings > General > Software Update. Once the update appears, tap on "Download and Install". Enter your Passcode. Tap "Agree" to the Terms and Conditions. Tap "Agree" again to confirm. If that all sounds a bit long winded, that's because it is. Betas aren't really meant for the general public, so they're deliberately harder to get. It's also worth noting that only those who have downloaded the beta will be able to see the new emojis, so if you send one to a friend who is still on an earlier version of iOS they will just see a jumble of characters. Getty The official version of iOS 10.2 is coming later this month, so unless you really can't wait for the new emoji, you're probably better off hanging on until then. As well as the new emoji, iOS 10.2 introduces three new wallpapers, a new "Celebration" screen effect for the Messages app, and a new headphone icon in the status bar for Bluetooth audio devices. There's also a new widget for the Videos app, a "Preserve Camera" setting, and a new "Press and Hold to Speak" menu under the Home Button Accessibility settings, as well as a new "Show Star Ratings" option under the Music app. irishmirror Comments Show more comments Previous Articles Apple's next iOS update will bring 72 new emoji to your iPhone - including shrug, facepalm and BACON The next update to Apple iPhone operating system brings a new batch of emoji 72 brand-new emojis have been revealed - and they include some we've wanted for a long time Recommended in Technology Christmas Christmas party dresses 2016 - be the star attraction in these hot looks Louth Watch hilarious moment Louth tot's first quad bike ride doesn’t go to plan Technology Twitter strikes back against internet trolls with new 'mute' and 'report abuse' tools Black Friday Sky are offering new Irish customers a FREE TV for Black Friday Lifestyle Cindy Crawford puts Malibu home up for sale for whopping $60 million Family Why you should NEVER feed your baby water - and how it could be fatal if you do Aer Lingus Aer Lingus has new routes to Miami, Porto and Split as it announces 2017 summer schedule Most Read in Lifestyle Aer Lingus Aer Lingus has new routes to Miami, Porto and Split as it announces 2017 summer schedule Black Friday Sky are offering new Irish customers a FREE TV for Black Friday Black Friday Amazon's Black Friday bonanza starts today - check out the best deals available Technology What is Amazon Prime?

November 9 AAPL: 110.88 -0.18 Irish government formally submits appeal against €13B Apple tax ruling Ben Lovejoy - 6 days ago @benlovejoy AAPL Tax View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit The Irish government is today formally appealing against a European Union ruling that it should have claimed an additional €13B in tax from Apple, which has its European headquarters in the country. The EU ruled that offering Apple a sweetheart tax rate of just 2.5% amounted to illegal state aid. Apple wasted no time in announcing that it would appeal the judgement soon after it was made, but the Irish government understandably took a little longer to announce that it, too, would be appealing. Deciding that it didn’t actually want an additional €13B in tax revenue would not have been the easiest of decisions, but it concluded that keeping Apple happy and retaining its status as home to the company’s European sales was of greater value. The Register reports that finance minister Michael Noonan said yesterday that the government would be submitting its appeal today. The government fundamentally disagrees with the European Commission’s analysis, and the decision left the government no choice but to take an appeal to the European Courts and this will be submitted [today]. It’s not yet known how long it may take for the case to be heard. Whatever the outcome, it now looks unlikely that Apple will be able to continue its practice of funneling all profits from European sales through Ireland, rather than paying tax in the countries in which sales were made. The issue has generated strong views on both sides of the Atlantic, with a marked divide between U.S. and European views.

Comments Computerworld | Nov 9, 2016 5:00 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Apple iOS Smartphones Mobile & Wireless Apple iPhone 7 Comments In yet more proof of the disconnect between the Android-loving media and the iPhone-loving public, the latest data claims Apple’s new iPhone 7 models are the best selling smartphones in both the US and UK. The return of the iOS star Data published today shows a 5.2% percentage point US market share increase for iOS during the third quarter of 2016 to 34.2%. While it remains dominant, Android share declined to 63.4% in the US. In the UK, iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were September’s biggest-selling devices, accounting for 15.1% of sales. iOS accounted for 40.6% of smartphone sales, up 2.4 percentage points from a year ago. The iPhone SE is very popular in the UK, where it accounts for 8.5 percent of sales. In the US, it delivers just 3.5 percent. “In the US, the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models made an immediate impact, becoming the best-selling smartphones in the month of September at 17.1%,” said Lauren Guenveur, Consumer Insight Director for Kantar Worldpanel ComTech in a statement. The data confirms the iPhone 6S remains the second best-selling device in the US in September. That’s interesting as 47 percent of iPhone users who purchased a new smartphone this year cite screen size as the main reason for their purchase. The Apple smartphone’s excellent camera technologies also drove sales, Patently Apple notes. Europe and China remain weak It’s not all great news. iOS market share posted two significant declines, in Germany from 17.5% to 15% and in Urban China from 18.7% to 14.2%. The Oppo R9 has become the biggest-selling smartphone there. “iOS posted yet another year-on-year decline to 14.2% of smartphone sales in the third quarter of 2016,” said Tamsin Timpson, Strategic Insight Director. She sees some signals of recovery for Apple’s fortunes there. “Importantly, this marks a period-on-period return to growth in sales, up from 13.5% in the three months ending in August. Signs of recovery “With supply constrained on the iPhone 7, and particularly the 7 Plus, this positive turn for Apple is a good sign, suggesting that as supply grows to meet demand, Apple will be able to turn the tide in Urban China.” It seems clear the last quarter’s seeming decline in Apple’s fortunes in China reflected the traditional pre-iPhone release slump we see each year. However, lack of new Macs and little movement across the company’s other hardware products combined with that slump to create a relatively week quarter, though expectations were, as usual, surpassed. Sayonara, Samsung Samsung’s decline continues as it faces the backlash of its exploding smartphones. The company posted a year-on-year decline from 36.9% to 33.8% of US smartphone sales in the third quarter, and is expected to struggle in the crucial holiday sales season. That’s really quite likely, given the company’s other products continue to generate problems, it’s too early to tell how this will impact long-term consumer trust in the brand. Even today, Apple suffers the tarnish of the Maps debacle, this will surely be far worse for a company that created life-threatening devices. Samsung also suffered in Europe. While it accounted for 30.4 percent of smartphone sales in the UK on strength of carrier discount deals, its fortunes everywhere else on the continent weren’t so great. Huawei knocked it aside in Italy, for example. Happy holidays What makes the Android versus iPhone marketshare comparisons so meaningless is that while Apple has built a sustainable and profitable business on iPhone sales, competitors have failed to achieve anything like that. Google, meanwhile, is about to consume the market it helped create. It seems clear that the smoke signals suggest iPhone and MacBook Pro will buoy company fortunes in the current quarter. Coming up next year? Presumably new desktop Macs potentially equipped for VR experience creation; and, of course, the next-generation iPad Pro. Apple’s decision to make refurbished iPhones available for sale via its online channels is also likely to be attractive to consumers, particularly in the event the company does not intend upgrading its still popular iPhone SE.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple working on Support app for iOS, looks to offer technical references, Genius Bar booking among features Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Wednesday, November 9th, 2016, 05:51 Category: iOS, News, Software Tweet This could come in handy. Apple looks to be in the process of introducing Support, its new iOS app that helps users find handy support articles as well as book AppleCare services and repairs. The company has offered the following description of the app: Need help? Apple Support app is your personalized guide to the best options from Apple. Find answers with articles tailored to your products and questions. Call, chat or email with an expert right away, or schedule a callback when it’s convenient. Get a repair at an Apple Store or a nearby Apple Authorized Service Provider. Apple Support is here to help. Apple previously included some of the features found in the new Support app in its existing Apple Store app, but recently removed the ability to schedule Genius Bar appointments as it removes the emphasis on the Genius Bar in its stores. Support notes which products are registered with your Apple ID and goes from there. Apple also launched a dedicated Twitter account regarding technical questions easier this year. The new app uses the ability to tell which products are registered with your Apple ID so you can find support for the right hardware too. Apple also launched a dedicated Twitter account for fielding technical questions over the social network earlier this year. Support will likely hit the US App Store soon and requires iOS 9.0 or later to install and run.

Through months of campaigning, Trump has been criticised for not releasing policies on a number of key issues ranging from climate change and science funding to encryption and cybersecurity. ADVERTISEMENT Here, we collect Trump's public statements on such issues and, where available, detail his stated policies. Climate change Trump’s campaign website makes no mention of environmental issues. He’s described man-made climate change as a hoax and in May 2016 said he would “cancel” the Paris Agreement. He opposes environmental regulations, arguing they are economically damaging.

In November 2012 he claimed the Chinese had invented global warming to hurt the United States. The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012 ADVERTISEMENT Read more Donald Trump accuses Google of political bias...again Donald Trump accuses Google of political bias...again By Amelia Heathman Trade When it comes to unfettered free trade, Donald Trump is not a typical Republican. While not opposed to the principle of trade, Trump has said any deals must protect US jobs and industry. He’s against the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and could withdraw from other, similar pacts if he thinks the US isn’t getting a fair shake. In June 2016, he likened the TPP to rape. “It's a rape of our country. It's a harsh word, but that's what it is – rape of our country,” Trump said. He’s accused China of unfair trade practices including currency manipulation and intellectual property theft. Trump’s statements on global trade are closely linked to his policies on domestic job creation. He plans to create 25 million jobs over ten years, having stated that too many jobs are being lost overseas. Reductions in tax and the removal of regulations would also boost job creation, Trump has claimed. Following Trump's win, the FTSE 100 opened 145 points, or 2 per cent lower, effectively wiping £37 billion off the value of top UK-listed companies. However, most of the losses were recovered.

In February 2016 he called on people to boycott Apple until it complied with the US government and unlocked the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters. “First of all, Apple ought to give [authorities] the security to that phone,” Trump told supporters at a rally in South Carolina. “What I think you ought to do is boycott Apple until they give that security number. I just thought of that—boycott Apple.” In a later phone interview with Bloomberg he firmed-up his position. “Tim Cook is living in the world of the make believe. I would come down so hard on him—you have no idea — his head would be spinning all of the way back to Silicon Valley.” Read more MIT's Trump AI uses neural networks to generate accurate nonsense MIT's Trump AI uses neural networks to generate accurate nonsense By Michael Rundle On the policy section of his campaign website, a section headed “Cybersecurity” explains Trump would “order an immediate review of all US cyber defences and vulnerabilities” through the establishment of a “Cyber Review Team” made up of individuals from the military, law enforcement and private sector. Science Trump has been described as “the first anti-science president” in US history by Michael Lubell, director of public affairs for the American Physical Society. Speaking to Nature, he warned the consequences of Trump’s victory for the scientific community would be “very, very severe”. "Tim Cook is living in the world of the make believe. I would come down so hard on him—you have no idea — his head would be spinning all of the way back to Silicon Valley" Donald Trump Again, Trump’s policies on science are thin at best. He’s said the US “must have programs such as a viable space program and institutional research that serve as incubators to innovation and the advancement of science and engineering in a number of fields”, while in the same breath suggested tax cuts will reduce science funding. His policies on immigration could also have a damaging effect on scientific research in the US. Space “I will free Nasa from the restriction of serving primarily as a logistics agency for low-Earth orbit activity,” Trump said at a rally in Sanford, Florida, in October 2016. “Instead, we will refocus its mission on space exploration. Under a Trump Administration, Florida and America will lead the way into the stars.” Trump believes in a “substantially expanded” public-private partnership to increase investment in space and drive economic growth. “Human exploration of our entire solar system by the end of this century should be Nasa’s focus and goal,” he said. Abortion Donald Trump thinks abortions should be illegal. In March 2016 he said women who have them should receive “some form of punishment”. When pressed, he didn’t say if that punishment should be a fine or a prison sentence. He has since done little to distance himself from the remarks, other than saying his position “had not changed” when later asked to clarify his comments. Trump had previously supported abortion rights. In October 1999 he said he was “very pro-choice”. ADVERTISEMENT Immigration and refugees One of the president-elect’s major policy ambitions is the creation of a 2,000-plus-mile wall along the US-Mexico border. He wants a reduction in legal immigration and has called for the forced deportation of more than 11 million undocumented migrants living in the US. In December 2015, in the wake of the San Bernardino terrorist attack, Trump called for a “total and complete shutdown” of the country’s borders to all Muslims. Both San Bernardino shooters are US citizens. On refugees, Trump has said his administration would suspend all immigration from Syria and Libya. Those looking to enter the US would be subject to an “extreme vetting” process, which would include “ideological certification”. Trump claimed the US currently has “no idea” who it’s letting into the country. The current US refugee vetting process is viewed as one of the most rigorous in the world. The screening process takes an average of 18 months to two years.

Strong sales of the iPhone 7 and the lower-priced iPhone 6s, the second best-selling device in the US in September, contributed to an overall growth of iOS to 34.2% in the third quarter of 2016.   Dominic Sunnebo, Business Unit Director for Kantar added that "In Great Britain, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were top-sellers during the month of September, accounting for 15.1% of sales. In the third quarter of 2016, iOS accounted for 40.6% of smartphone sales, a 2.4 percentage point increase from the same period a year ago. It's interesting to note the continued success of the iPhone SE in Britain, accounting for 8.5% of sales in the quarter vs. a share of just 3.5% in the US."   During Apple's Q4 Financial Conference Call, their CFO noted that even though sales were down in China in Fiscal Q4, Apple would return to growth in China in the December quarter and that demand for the iPhone 7 is outstripping supply, especially the iPhone 7. The Kantar report today noted that "with supply constrained on the iPhone 7, and particularly the 7 Plus, this positive turn for Apple is a good sign, suggesting that as supply grows to meet demand, Apple will be able to turn the tide in Urban China."   Samsung in Store for More Pain   In respect to Samsung, Lauren Guenveur noted in today's report that "Despite some sales from the beleaguered Samsung Galaxy Note 7, still technically available through the month of September, Samsung posted a year-on-year decline from 36.9% to 33.8% of US smartphone sales in the third quarter."   Guenveur added that "The holiday sales season may prove to be more challenging than normal for Samsung, who competes head-to-head with Apple during this crucial time of year. Fallout from the Note 7 recall could have an unintended impact on continuing sales of other, similarly-named Samsung devices (chiefly the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge), as consumers may not always understand the difference between the model names. However, deep holiday discounts, as we saw with the Galaxy S6 last year, may counteract any expected negative impact, as the driving reason for choice among US consumers remains finding a good deal on the price of the phone." Though any way you look at it, Samsung is in for a rocky calendar Q4 without a doubt.   Notable 2016 Smartphone Trends   In other research areas of interest, a secondary Kantar report noted that "In 3Q 2014, just before the launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, which introduced the 4.7 and 5.5-inch form factors, 47% of smartphones featured a screen size of less than 4.5 inches. In the most recent quarter, that share is just 17%. More than a quarter of the units sold now have 5.5-inch or larger screens.   With that shift, the reasons people love their smartphones have also changed – 47% of owners who acquired their device in 2016 cited 'the size of the screen' as the main driver of their satisfaction. For those who acquired phones in 2014, 'durability and reliability' was the leading reason for satisfaction, cited by 41% of consumers.   After screen size, Kantar noted that the performance of the camera is the next driver of satisfaction among new smartphone owners, cited by 39% of consumers. While this is not a monumental percentage increase from the 32% who expressed this preference in 2014, it is accompanied by a move up the list of priorities, with camera quality advancing from third to second in importance.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish More Evidence That 2017’s iPhones Could Sport OLED Displays By Tyler Lee on 11/09/2016 03:46 PST There have been many rumors in recent times to suggest that 2017’s iPhone could sport an OLED display. Recently those rumors have been seemingly confirmed by Sharp’s CEO, but now thank to a recent SEC filing discovered by an investment firm, there is more evidence to suggest that 2017’s iPhone could indeed be packing an OLED display. According to the SEC filing discovered by J.P. Morgan, it seems that Apple has placed a purchase order for more than a year’s duration that is worth around $4 billion. The firm believes that this has to do with a huge order of OLED displays that Apple has placed with Samsung for the next-gen iPhone. Given that Apple tends to prefer sourcing from different suppliers, the idea that they might be buying from Sharp and Samsung at the same time doesn’t really come as a surprise. However whether or not this purchase order is for the iPhone remains to be seen. As it stands Apple already uses OLED in some of its products, like the Apple Watch. More recently it was discovered that the OLED displays of the Touch Bars in the new MacBook Pros are being supplied by Samsung, so it is possible that the order could be for that as well. That being said, the shift to OLED is one that is widely expected anyway, but until we get the official confirmation, maybe try not to get your hopes up too high just yet.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple New patent shows Apple pumping AR tech into its base services for iOS devices Kevin Parrish Digital TrendsNovember 9, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Although Apple CEO Tim Cook hasn’t officially laid out the company’s etched-in-stone plans for virtual reality and augmented reality, he has hinted that the company may lean more towards the latter, as AR keeps users visually connected with others in the same room while VR experiences completely engulf each viewer. Support for these technologies begins at the operating system level, and a recent patent reveals that Apple could be currently working on implementing AR into its base iOS services. Published by the United States Patent and Trademark Office on Tuesday, Apple’s new patent is simply called “Augmented reality maps.” It was submitted for approval in February 2010, and lists former Apple employee Jaron Waldman as the inventor. Waldman was responsible for developing the location-based services infrastructure for Maps, CoreLocation, and MapKit for iOS and OS X. He left Apple in 2013 to establish Curbside, a service for finding, buying, and retrieving products from nearby stores. More: Apple patent could force you to put down your iPhone at “sensitive events” Based on the new patent, Apple’s Maps application won’t utilize a special headset that will project augmented map information in the user’s field of view. Instead, the information will be displayed on a mobile device’s screen, and will based on the user’s current geographical location, camera direction, and the tilt of the device. Essentially, users will point their iOS device in a specific direction and a search result will display nearby points of interest in an overlay rendered over the camera’s real-time feed. For instance, the owner of an iPhone may load up Maps and point the device in a specific direction when visiting Washington, D.C. In turn, Maps will render relevant information in a layer drawn over the camera’s real-time video feed displayed on the screen. This information will stay “attached” to those real-world points of interest no matter how the iPhone’s point-of-view is shifted. After that, if the user selects a location on the screen, Maps will progress to display directional information as the user moves toward that location. Apple AR Maps PatentMore That said, the AR version of Maps relies on several factors: a built-in camera, GPS connectivity, a digital compass to determine the camera’s direction, an accelerometer to determine the camera’s tilt orientation, and internet access for retrieving and servicing map information requests based on the area surrounding the current GPS coordinates. That information will include “descriptive” data of features including places, roads, buildings, and other points of interest. Of course, we can’t forget the graphics processor that will generate the augmented information and the real-time video feed on the same screen: “The graphics processor configured to: overlay, on the video image, map data representing each of the one or more identified points of interest and an illustrated portion of a route from the GPS location identified by the GPS device to a selected one of the identified points of interest, the route being determined based on the map data; and update the illustrated portion of the route as the GPS location of the video capture device changes with movement along the route; and the display configured to present the video image that has been overlaid.” If anything, the patent reveals that Apple has tooled around with AR technology for at least six years. Naturally, the advancement of mobile technology makes the patent relevant to today’s devices rather than what powered the iPhone 4 so many years ago. It also shows that Apple is indeed building an AR foundation into iOS, and hopefully we’ll see all that work go live with an upcoming iOS release in the near future.

Apple, of course, has a habit of acquiring smaller tech firms without comment, so the fact no official announcement followed didn’t necessarily mean the rumours were unfounded. And yesterday TechCrunch cited a source who says that Apple did indeed acquire some of Omnifone’s tech, while also licensing some of its patents with an option to buy them in the future. The tech site also noted that about sixteen former Omnifone employees now list Apple as their employer on LinkedIn, so in addition to some technology purchases a little bit of head-hunting went on too, maybe even one of those ‘acquihires’ that idiots talk about. Not able to deny the CVs of its new team members, Apple has now confirmed to Billboard that some former Omnifone staffers are now on its payroll. All this chatter about what happened to Omnifone comes as the founder of that company, Rob Lewis, finally puts live his latest digital music venture Electric Jukebox.

Some might be satisfied with the most affordable deal that will land them a functional one. But the second-hand and refurbished market for iPhones isn’t exactly a worry-free one, but now Apple is swooping in to save you from anxiety, and earn your money as well. Apple has just silently added iPhones to its list of refurbished products for sale, giving aspiring iPhone owners another route to their dream smartphone. It’s not perfect, of course. There’s no going around the fact that a refurbished product, even one sold by Apple, has been previously owned and returned for one reason or another that Apple will never divulge. Of course, refurbished devices that Apple itself sells come with the explicitly guarantee that they have been tested, even “rigorously”, before being resold. It’s not entirely impossible, however, that something might sleep through the cracks. For some, the price cuts might very well be worth the risk. A 64 GB iPhone 6s Plus , for example, goes for only $589, which is a good $110 less than its original price. A 16 GB model, on the other hand, is only $80 less at $449. Both, however, translate to a 15% discount. All color options are available, including Space Gray, Silver, Gold, and even Rose Gold, but only the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are being sold and nothing older or newer. To offer even more peace of mind, Apple gives refurbished products a 1-year warranty, in addition to replacing the outer shell and slotting in a new battery. In other words, they all look brand new and may even behave as such. Refurbished iPhones are all unlocked and SIM-free, which means you can use them with the carrier of your choice.

Many are lost for words and, in such times, a picture - or in this case an emoji - can paint a thousand words. Luckily, Apple has just released the second public beta of its latest iPhone operating system, iOS 10.2, which among other things includes a "facepalm" emoji - how apt! Facepalm is one of the 72 new emoji that were approved by the Unicode Consortium back in June 2016, as part of the Unicode 9.0 update Others include "nauseated face", "wilted flower" and "black heart", all of which might come in handy over the next few days. Unfortunately, as this is a beta release, you can't just download it onto your iPhone. If you want the facepalm and other emoji today, you'll need to register for a developer account. Here's how to do it. You are strongly advised to back-up your device before starting: Go to beta.apple.com on the iPhone or iPad you want to enroll in the beta. Tap on "Sign up". Enter your Apple ID email address and password. Tap "Sign in". Tap "Accept" to agree to the terms and conditions. Once you've registered your account you need to download the iOS 10.2 public beta: Go to beta.apple.com again. Tap the iOS tab. Tap on "Download profile". Tap on "Install" in the upper right corner. Enter your Passcode. Tap on "Install", this time to consent to the beta agreement. Tap on "Install" at the bottom to confirm. Tap on "Restart" to reboot your device. The last stage is to install the iOS 10.2 beta on your device: From your Home screen, tap on Settings > General > Software Update. Once the update appears, tap on "Download and Install". Enter your Passcode. Tap "Agree" to the Terms and Conditions. Tap "Agree" again to confirm. If that all sounds a bit long winded, that's because it is. Betas aren't really meant for the general public, so they're deliberately harder to get. It's also worth noting that only those who have downloaded the beta will be able to see the new emojis, so if you send one to a friend who is still on an earlier version of iOS they will just see a jumble of characters. (Photo: Getty) The official version of iOS 10.2 is coming later this month, so unless you really can't wait for the new emoji, you're probably better off hanging on until then. As well as the new emoji, iOS 10.2 introduces three new wallpapers, a new "Celebration" screen effect for the Messages app, and a new headphone icon in the status bar for Bluetooth audio devices. There's also a new widget for the Videos app, a "Preserve Camera" setting, and a new "Press and Hold to Speak" menu under the Home Button Accessibility settings, as well as a new "Show Star Ratings" option under the Music app. Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @MirrorTech Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On Apple Donald Trump iOS iOS 10 iPad iPhone tech all Most Read Most Recent TechnologyWhatsApp finally launches the feature EVERYONE wants - and it has consequences for Facebook, Google and Apple Video calling has finally been made available on the platform, putting it into competition with Messenger, Duo and FaceTime NintendoNintendo Classic Mini NES sells out in days as gamers rush to buy cheap and cheerful retro console Dodgy Amazon sellers have been jacking up the prices to try and cash in on demand NintendoNintendo Mini NES Classic Edition: Release date, price, games and how to pre-order Mario's nostalgic new console Nintendo is going back to the glory days with this brand new version of the classic NES console - here's everything you need to know about it CGIJohn Lewis Christmas advert 2016: Experts reveal technical wizardry behind nation's favourite commercial Creating a photo-realistic boxer dog and making him bounce on a trampoline is just as tricky as you'd expect SmartphonesMirror Online has a new look - this is what we've changed Mirror.co.uk has switched to a fully responsive design, to give you the best experience whatever the size of your screen Which?Are phone and tablet software updates 'sapping' your battery life and storage space?

Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations TechEye Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations Menu Ireland goes to EU court to stop Apple giving it money Posted on November 9, 2016 by Nick Farrell - Business, News In a bizarre state of affairs, the Irish government is going to the EU court to prevent Apple from having to pay it a huge amount of money. The Irish Finance Minister, Michael Noonan, will bring the debate to the EU court, a move that could trigger a years long court battle. The move comes from  European Commission finding that Ireland had been giving Apple tax breaks, something that has attracted a number of multinational employers to Ireland. The EU, however, has ordered the practices to change. After a three-year probe into Ireland’s relationship with Apple, the European Commission ordered Ireland to collect $14.5 billion in back taxes from the company. Apple has also vowed to fight against the EU decision. It activated its minions in the US Treasury Department says the decision is a threat “to undermine foreign investment, the business climate in Europe, and the important spirit of economic partnership between the US and the EU”. After all big corporations not paying taxs is the American way. The European Commission’s Jean-Claude Juncker, who said that the ruling against Apple is clearly based on facts, argues that the decision is not one against the US, but rather against unfair business practices. Ireland’s corporate tax rate is currently 12.5 percent, however, Apple was paying far less thanks to a deal between it and Ireland that dates back to the 1990s. The deal essentially allowed Apple to record all sales as being in Ireland rather than other countries where Apple products were sold. In return, Apple brought thousands of jobs to the country.   Search for: Recent Articles NHS email system borked by one idiot and 120 pedants The NHS’s email system is under pressure after one idiot decided to send an email to everyone.

An Apple information website based in Japan said the company might have plans to bring out a 'pure white' or 'jet white' version of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The website cited the source as a 'supplier'.

Sources speaking to Japanese publisher MacOtakara said a 'pure white' version of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus could be brought out in the future. 'Apple seems to have a plan to add a pure white model to iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus,' the website said. The website cited the source as a 'supplier'.  'But this information may be unreliable,' the site added. The company currently offers the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in jet black, black, gold, rose gold and silver, while the Apple Watch is already available in a ceramic white. MailOnline contacted Apple for comment on the rumours but, at the time of writing, had not received a response.  Macotakara was one of the first sources to predict the death of the iPhone’s headphone jack.

The stakes for the iPhone 7 were high after sales of the gadget dropped during two straight quarters this year, the first declines in its history.  Apple's new iPhone 7 sold out within minutes of pre orders opening earlier this year, with the new jet black colour being the first to go.

But others have praised the move - which Apple says took 'courage' - highlighting the importance of innovation to the iPhone's enduring popularity. The range of cases available for the iPhone 7 already comes with a white option (shown in the middle) WILL THE JET BALCK IPHONE SCRATCH? The glossy 'jet black' finish on the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus may be more prone to scratching than other colours, says Apple. The frank admission was spotted under the FAQ section on Apple's iPhone 7 web page. The disclaimer reads: 'The high-gloss finish of the jet black iPhone 7 is achieved through a precision nine-step anodisation and polishing process. 'Its surface is equally as hard as other anodised Apple products; however, its high shine may show fine micro-abrasions with use.  'If you are concerned about this, we suggest you use one of the many cases available to protect your iPhone'.  The glossy 'jet black' iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 (left) and  matte 'black' iPhone 7 (right). The new phones feature improved cameras and eliminate the traditional headphone jack in favour of new technology APPLE BACKLASH AFTER DITCHING EARPLUGS SOCKET  After months of anticipation, Apple has finally revealed the iPhone 7 which has controversially dumped the headphone socket.

The committee found that 160 of them are problematic in terms of sexual suggestiveness. 157 were found on the Google Play and the other three were on the Apple App Store."   The committee told Apple Korea to re-rate the three games as well but Apple Korea has not carried it out at all. Both Google Korea and Apple Korea are claiming that the difference between their standards and the committee's yardstick be acknowledged.   According to the Korea Mobile Internet Business Association, Google is currently enjoying a market share of 75% in the South Korean Android app market with 3.2 trillion won (US$2.86 billion) in sales.   The committee explained that it would compel both Google Korea and Apple Korea to follow the local age rating rules by exercising its own authority within 30 days or face criminal charges.   Considering that Apple only had 3 out of 552 games that carried sexually suggestive material for a younger audience, you have to see this move as pure politics. Clearly Apple's review process is vastly superior to most and should have been singled out with a congratulatory note for the excellent track record instead of being publicly chastised.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments. Those using abusive language or behavior will result in being blacklisted on Disqus.   Side Note: It sounds like the report is suggesting that the remaining 392 games must have been attributed to the 'One Store' which I'm unfamiliar with. If you know who owns the 'One Store' please send the name in the comments section below.

The Quaker Oats Company, a subsidiary of PepsiCo, Inc., announced the three finalist Instant Oatmeal flavors vying for a $250,000 grand prize in the brand's first-ever Bring Your Best Bowl Contest: Apple Cheddar Rosemary, Lemon Ricotta Pancake, and Vanilla Chai. Now it's up to America to decide which flavor will win. The three finalist oatmeal flavors are available in a variety pack at stores nationwide for people to try and rally for the one they like best. Through November 19, consumers can vote for their favorite flavor at BringYourBestBowl.com or by using the #VoteAppleCheddarRosemary, #VoteLemonRicottaPancake, #VoteVanillaChai hashtags on Twitter. Once votes are in and tallied, the grand prize winner will be revealed and rewarded with $250,000 in February 2017, along with the chance for their oatmeal creation to hit store shelves for a limited time. "From classic to deliciously quirky, the Bring Your Best Bowl contest encouraged America to whip up some mouth-watering oatmeal combinations," said Tiffani Thiessen, actress, foodie and mom of two, who helped Quaker kick off the contest in New York's Time Square last January. "All three Bring Your Best Bowl finalist flavors prove just how versatile oatmeal can be, and inspire me to keep mixing it up with my oatmeal dishes at home!" In December 2015, Quaker set out to find its next oatmeal flavor by inviting Americans to participate in the first-ever Bring Your Best Bowl contest. Fans across the country helped celebrate the versatility of oats by submitting oatmeal flavors using two to five ingredients, along with their inspirations. From December through March, Quaker received thousands of different submissions, but the combination of flavor ideas and their inspirations pushed Apple Cheddar Rosemary, Lemon Ricotta Pancake and Vanilla Chai to the top. "People had a lot of fun with this contest, and it was amazing to uncover some really unexpected oatmeal flavors and creative inspirations," said Becky Frankiewicz, senior vice president and general manager of Quaker Foods North America.

Ireland this week launched its bid to overturn the European Commission's order for it to claw back €13 billion in unpaid taxes from Apple. Addressing the EU's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee on Tuesday, Ireland's minister of finance Michael Noonan reiterated that his government fundamentally disagrees with the Commission with regard to Apple. In late August, the EC announced the results of an investigation launched in June 2014 into Apple's tax affairs in Ireland. The investigation concluded that the tax arrangements of two Apple subsidiaries incorporated in Ireland artificially lowered the iPhone maker's taxable earnings, violating EU state aid rules. "The government fundamentally disagrees with the European Commission’s analysis and the decision left the government no choice but to take an appeal to the European Courts," Noonan said in his speech, which was published on the Finance Ministry's Website. Noonan said the appeal would be lodged on Wednesday. "Given that the case is the subject of ongoing legal proceedings, I am constrained by what I can say in making any further comment," he added. Apple CEO Tim Cook has defended his company's track record in Ireland, pointing out that it was a bold decision by late Apple founder Steve Jobs to invest in the country in the first place, and that the EC's actions could jeopardise job creation in Europe. "We now find ourselves in the unusual position of being ordered to retroactively pay additional taxes to a government that says we don't owe them any more than we've already paid," Cook said, in an open letter in August.

Stéphane de Chalain, le Chief Stipendiary Steward, du Mauritius Turf Club a rendu public le Racing Steward’s Report du samedi 5 novembre 2016. Racing Stewards’ Report GENERAL A. Jockey S. Bhundoo was injured during the running of race 1 and was unable to fulfill his further riding engagements. The Stewards approved V. Bundhoo as the replacement rider for Captain’s Orders (Race 2) and for Maestro’s Salute (Race 3). B. Jockey Y. Emamdee was stood down by the Club’s Medical Officer after the running of race 5. The Stewards approved B. Bhaugeerothee as the replacement rider for Saarikh (Race 7) and for Halabaloo (Race 8). RACE 1 – THE VELOGIC CONTAINER SERVICES TROPHY Following the running of the race, the Stewards sounded the inquiry sign and viewed the video replays of the race. It was established that approaching the 600 metres Kapiti Coast clipped the heels of Monarchs Emblem, stumbling badly and dislodging apprentice Teetan. Commodus, which was following, was inconvenienced and shifted out, dislodging jockey Bhundoo. An inquiry into this incident will be held when the riders will be available. The start was delayed when shortly after being boxed, Young Royal turned its head sideways with the latter getting its head stuck on the left hand side of the gate and had to be attended to. Commodus, Kapiti Coast, and Magic Jay were slow to begin. Agincourt jumped awkwardly and shifted out. Agincourt then raced wide without cover in the early stages. From approaching the 1300 metres Agincourt commenced to over-race and, when being settled, threw its head, racing ungenerously for some distance. From approaching the 500 metres Fyrkat commenced to give ground and, when being urged forward, failed to respond. Leaving the 450 metres Jullidar was taken out from behind Duke the Duke to improve its position and, in doing so, carried Magic Jay wider on the track. Near the 350 metres Duke the Duke was taken out from behind Lividus to improve its position, carrying Jullidar wider on the track. Leaving the 250 metres Lividus had to be taken out from behind Young Royal to secure clear running and in doing so carried Duke the Duke and Jullidar wider on the track. Lividus hung out from leaving the 150 metres. Apprentice Ramgopal (Lividus) was shown the video replays of the home straight and told that he should straighten his mounts when they shift ground. Monarchs Emblem shifted out from the whip from near the 150 metres, with jockey Emamdee putting his whip away passing the 100 metres and straightening the latter. From leaving the 100 metres Jullidar hung in under pressure. Magic Jay hung in in the home straight. An inquiry was held into the handling of Monarchs Emblem. Trainer Narang explained that when being urged forward to race close to the lead, Monarch’s Emblem has pulled in its races and faded late, as such, he had instructed Jockey Emamdee not to insist at the start and to endeavour to secure a position in 3rd or 4th on the rails and depending on the pace to decide where to move from. Jockey Emamdee confirmed these instructions and explained that after jumping well he had to bring back his mount to secure a position on the rails, he added that from then onwards Monarchs Emblem race relax and passing the 400 metres when Jullidar was taken out to improve its position, he managed to make ground on the rails and eventually secured an inside run in the home straight. He added that despite quickening in the early stages of the home straight, Monarchs Emblem hung out from leaving the 150 metres and stayed one paced over the concluding stages. When questioned Jockey Emamdee explained that he would have had to insist to keep the position behind the leader and that he was apprehensive of his mount pulling as it had done in the past had he insisted. Trainer Narang concurred and added that it was Monarchs Emblem’s best race to date, so he was satisfied with the way the gelding was ridden. After consideration, the Stewards decided not to proceed further. The Club’s Veterinary Surgeon reported that Fyrkat was lame on the near fore leg and that Kapiti Coast was not striding out properly after the race. Routine urine and blood specimens were taken for analysis from Duke The Duke after the race. RACE 2 – THE VELOGIC HAULAGE SERVICES TROPHY Following the running of the race, the Stewards considered an objection lodged by jockey Emamdee, the rider of Apple Pie being declared 3rd, against Al Firenze, being declared the winner, alleging interference shortly after the start. After taking evidence from both riders and Assistant Trainers and viewing the video replays of the incident, it was established that Apple Pie jumped awkwardly and shifted out, brushing the hindquarters of Al Firenze, which became unbalanced and was turned sideways despite jockey Mansour’s attempt to straighten it with Apple Pie being crowded for room and having to be eased. The Stewards being of the opinion that this incident did not materially affect the result of the race, dismissed the objection. Jockey Mansour was shown the video replays of the incident, severely reprimanded and told that in future even if his mount was unbalanced he was to make a greater effort to straighten it. Captain’s Orders was slow out. Prince George jumped awkwardly and shifted out, crowding Plain Of Wisdom onto Fleetfox, which had shifted in on jumping, with Fleetfox then being pushed outwards. In The Trenches raced wide in the early stages. Prince George raced fiercely from leaving the 1200 metres. For some distance leaving the 700 metres Plain Of Wisdom, which was overracing, became awkward close to the heels of Al Firenze. Leaving the 200 metres Prince George was taken out abruptly from behind In The Trenches, which had shifted in despite jockey Fayd’herbe’s attempt to straighten it, and when Prince George was taken out, it inconvenienced Plain Of Wisdom, which was following. Jockey Bardottier (Prince George) was shown the video replays of the incident and told that in future he should show more care when shifting ground from behind horses. When questioned with regard to the poor performance of Moi Power, jockey Winks explained that this gelding had pleased in the lead up to the race, as such he expected a good run from the latter. He said that from its wide draw he had to use his mount to secure a good position with Moi Power over-racing in the early stages, however leaving the 900 metres he managed to get cover, with Moi Power relaxing nicely and when asked for an effort from approaching the 350 metres, it failed to quicken and had a tendency to lay in in the home straight. A subsequent veterinary examination of Moi Power revealed no abnormality. Routine urine and blood specimens were taken for analysis from Al Firenze after the race. RACE 3 – THE AVIOSERVIZI TROPHY Prior to the start being effected Phiri E Kwatile turned its head to the left and whilst the start was effected, the handler was busy attending the gelding to straighten its head. As such, the handler was still holding its near side rein when the start was effected. The Stewards, being of the opinion that Phiri E Kwatile was denied a fair start, acting under Rule 144 (1), declared the latter a non-runner. In view of this, all bets on Phiri E Kwatile were ordered to be refunded and wining bets with bookmakers were paid less 15 cents per rupee, the average price of Phiri E Kwatile being 9/2. Aware jumped awkwardly, bumping Maestro’s Salute on its hindquarter. Nothing Compares stood flat-footed and was slow out. A P Strike raced wide in the early stages and leaving the 1300 metres was urged forward to endeavour to secure a position closer to the fence. From leaving the 1100 metres, when being settled, A P Strike raced ungenerously, throwing its head. From leaving the 800 metres Aware, which was racing fiercely, threw its head and raced ungenerously when being steadied to avoid the heels of Prince Of Wings.

From their wide draws Candy Rock and Beach In A Bottle were taken across to race behind runners. Silver Dice raced wide throughout. Approaching the 300 metres Super Glue was urged forward into a tight gap between Greys Inn Control and Bono Vox, with Super Glue racing tight and becoming momentarily held up when unable to improve from behind Blaze Of Noon. Leaving the 300 metres Candy Rock was taken out from behind Greys Inn Control to secure clear running and raced wide rounding the home turn. Approaching the 200 metres Super Glue was taken to the inside of Blaze Of Noon to secure clear running. The Club’s Veterinary Surgeon reported that Candy Rock was not striding out properly after the race. Routine urine and blood specimens were taken for analysis from Independence after the race. RACE 5 – THE FLYNT INTERNATIONAL FORWARDERS TROPHY Memphis Mafia hesitated at the start and was slow out. Silver Bluff jumped awkwardly. Leaving the 900 metres Ryder Cup was cramped for room between Rear Admiral and Prince Of Thieves. At an inquiry into this incident, it was established that approaching the 900 metres Rear Admiral changed legs and shifted out and was then brushed by Ryder Cup on its hindquarter with Rear Admiral becoming unbalanced and shifting out further, carrying Ryder Cup outwards onto Prince Of Thieves, which was improving around Ryder Cup. Passing the 700 metres Silver Bluff was taken out when awkward close to the heels of Memphis Mafia. Approaching the 300 metres Memphis Mafia was taken out from behind Rear Admiral to improve its position, carrying Ryder Cup wider on the track. The Club’s Veterinary Surgeon reported that Ryder Cup was lame on the near fore leg and that Prince Of Thieves lost its off fore shoe during the run. Routine urine and blood specimens were taken for analysis from Prince Of Thieves after the race. RACE 6 – Velogic–LA COUPE DES PRESIDENTS Diamond Light was slow out. At an inquiry into the handling of Top Jet, Trainer Maingard explained that at its last start, after jumping well over 1500 metres Top Jet had raced closer to the pace than expected and had faded badly. As such for today’s race, taking in consideration the 2200 metres he instructed jockey Sooful to relax the gelding at the back of the field and wait for as long as possible to make his move. Jockey Sooful confirmed these instructions and explained that after jumping reasonably well, he brought his mount back so as to ride as per instructions, however as jockey Rama (Everest) did not insist on his inside, he was caught in a one-off position in the early stages with Top Jet over-racing. He added that leaving the 1800 metres Everest commenced to improve, he then managed to secure a position on the fence behind Everest. He also said that his mount then raced relaxed and, when asked for an effort at the 300 metres, quickened and stayed one pace in the early stages of the home straight before tiring later to finish 3rd. After consideration, the Stewards decided not to proceed further other than to tell Jockey Sooful that it was a fact that the way Everest was ridden in the early stages had a bearing in the manner he rode his horse, however he was told to show better judgement in future. Leaving the 150 metres Jockey Joorawon stood up in the saddle and made excessive celebratory gestures towards the crowd until passing the winning post. At an inquiry, he was shown video replays of the home straight pleaded guilty under for a breach of MTC Rule 53 (j) he was fined Rs 5,000. An inquiry was held into the handling of Everest. Trainer Rousset explained that he instructed jockey Rama to endeavour to settle this gelding at the back of the field as it had raced well when racing in similar manner at its last outing over 2200 metres. Jockey Rama confirmed these instructions and explained that after jumping well and realizing that Top Jet on the outside had jumped better than all the horses, he decided to bring his mount back as per his instructions. He added that he was unable to do as Everest started to over race with Top Jet racing on its outside. He also said that he persevered in bringing back his mount as he was under the impression that Top Jet would eventually improve on the outside and that he would obtain cover from the latter. When questioned, he explained that had he allowed Everest to improve behind Parachute Man, he felt his mount would have pulled too hard and would not have quickened in the latter stages. Mr Rousset concurred and added that in his opinion, no matter how Everest was ridden he would never have beaten Parachute Man on the day. After consideration, Jockey Rama was found guilty of a breach of MTC Rule 160 A (i) for failing to ride Everest to the satisfaction of the Stewards the particulars being that, being the rider of Everest, he failed to ride this gelding to the satisfaction of the Stewards the particulars being, that from approximately 75 metres after the start until near the 1850 metres, he over restrained his mount on numerous occasions resulting in the latter fighting him and at the same time allowing the leader Parachute Man, the odds on favourite of the race, to have a soft lead and creating a considerable gap of approximately 8 lengths when it was reasonable for him to let his horse run in its pace from the start and race closer to the leader. He was suspended from riding in races for one race meeting and fined Rs 10,000. Routine urine and blood specimens were taken for analysis from Parachute Man after the race. RACE 7 – THE TRANSGLOBAL TROPHY Roman Silvanus stood flat-footed and was slow out, losing considerable ground. Near the 1800 metres Aficionado shifted in, crowding Anafesto onto Urbi Et Orbi with the latter then being taken in onto Noordhoek Ice with the latter then having to be checked and losing its position. At an inquiry into this incident, it was established that Aficionado shifted in abruptly with Anafesto shying away from it, shifting in and carrying Urbi Et Orbi onto Noordhoek Ice, which was insisting on its inside. After consideration, the Stewards decided not to proceed further other than to report it as a racing incident. From approaching the 1800 metres Urbi Et Orbi was taken out and allowed to improve its position on the outside of runners. Leaving the 1400 metres Cula was taken out from behind Anafesto to improve its position and in doing so carried Urbi Et Orbi wider on the track.

Near the 150 metres Saarikh was taken to the inside of Anafesto to continue going forward and leaving the 100 metres to the inside of Seeking The Dream. Approaching the 100 metres Aficionado had to be taken out when awkward close to the heels of Urbi Et Orbi. The Club’s Veterinary Surgeon reported that Roman Silvanus was not striding out properly after the race. When questioned, Trainer Henry explained that as Anafesto was wearing blinkers for the first time over 1850 metres and that there did not seem to be much pace in the race, he had instructed Jockey Sturgeon to endeavour to jump well and be positive in the early stages to race close to the lead. Jockey Sturgeon explained that after jumping well he secured a position close to the lead but was cramped for room passing the road and got caught racing 3 wide. He then decided to let Anafesto improve in hand to secure the lead. He added that from then onwards the gelding raced relax and stayed one paced when asked for an effort leaving the 400 metres. Jockey Sturgeon also said that in his opinion it was not a change of tactics as such but that he could not do otherwise that go forward due to racing circumstances. After consideration, the Stewards decided not to proceed further. Routine urine and blood specimens were taken for analysis from Seeking The Dream after the race. RACE 8 – THE VELOGIC WAREHOUSE AND DISTRIBUTION SERVICES TROPHY Shield Of Thunder was slow out and shortly after the start was crowded onto Dark Abbot by Ravatak, which had jumped inwards.

Approaching the 100 metres Nadas had to be eased when unable to improve from behind Dark Abbot and was not tested over the concluding stages. When questioned, jockey Joorawon (Nadas) explained that when asked for an effort leaving the 300 metres, his mount failed to quicken and leaving the 200 metres he elected to improve into a gap on the inside of Ritmo Total and at the same time Ritmo Total hung in badly, carrying him inwards onto the heels of Dark Abbot, which was giving ground, forcing him to bring his mount back.

Picture taken October 3, 2016. Reuters/Maxim Zmeyev More Australian credit card users will soon be able to use Apple Pay. Cuscal, one of the country’s largest card issuers, has signed a deal with Apple, allowing 31 of the banks and credit unions under it to be added to the contactless payment app. Currently, only American Express and ANZ support Apple Pay. But with Cuscal onboard, 31 of its banking partners will also support the digital wallet service. These clients include Bank Australia, Bank of Sydney, Beyond Bank Australia, Credit Union Australia (CUA), Police Bank and Defence Bank. The full list of participating Cuscal clients are listed here. “Ultimately, us doing the work with Apple Pay in providing these connection services over time will enable just over 4 million card holders to have access to that if all of our client organisations opt in,” Craig Kennedy, Cuscal managing director, was quoted by the Daily Telegraph as saying. He also encouraged Australia’s biggest banks to settle their differences with Apple so their customers can use the service. “I hope that Apple and the banks find some middle ground here because I think it would be everybody’s interest if they found a solution for their current stalement,” he said. “The more people use these services and the more cards that are in there, the more common that it becomes and it lifts everybody.” Kennedy was referring to CBA, NAB, Westpac and other banks’ dispute with Apple. The major banks want the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) to allow them to challenge Apple’s monopoly of its iPhone digital wallet and give them access to its NFC antenna. The ACCC rejected their demand for interim authorisation, though the fight is far from over, only delayed.

As expected, Apple appears to be securing OLED panels ahead of the likely launch of the iPhone 8 in September 2017. JP Morgan has dived deep into Apple’s most recent Securities and Exchange Commission 10-K filing, and uncovered a purchase order for what may be OLED panels. The order extends for an entire year, and is valued at around $4 billion. What’s interesting is the the purchase order coincides with an “off-balance sheet obligation” for the same amount from Q3, which – as AppleInsider notes – analysts believe may be related to Apple’s sourcing of panels from Samsung’s display division. Unfortunately, there’s no guarantee that this means the iPhone 8 will use an OLED screen. However, while it’s believed that Samsung is providing screens to Apple, it may not be the only supplier. Japan Display has already confirmed plans to move to OLED mass production, while Sharp’s CEO recently revealed that Apple is shifting to OLED screens. In fact, it’s long been rumoured that Apple would begin using OLED displays on the 2017 iPhone model. It’s expected to be one of many major upgrades that are set to herald the 10th anniversary iPhone release. Apple has never launched an OLED iPhone, despite rivals such as Samsung having already adopted the technology. Unlike conventional LED-backlit displays, an OLED screen uses pixels that emit their own light. This means that individual pixels can be turned on or off, reducing the need for a backlight, and thus improving power efficiency. OLED displays also show deeper blacks, and are generally seen as a big improvement over traditional LCD screens.

Trump's Views on Apple Stock (AAPL) Now that the 2016 presidential race has come to a close, investors are wondering what a Trump Administration would mean for their investments. One company that should worry is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), especially since Apple stock (AAPL) came under fire duringthe campaign. Time and time again, President-elect Donald Trump would cite Apple as a symbol of corporate abuse in America. He would point out their scuffles with tax authorities in Europe or their outsourcing to China as examples of how the rules are rigged.

4 mlm Aussies to be able to use Apple Pay soon Source: Xinhua   2016-11-09 15:41:54 Xinhua Weibo Facebook Twitter Reddit Diigo Delicious Digg Linkedin MySpace Sina Weibo Kaixin Renren Q-zone Tencent Weibo Sohu Weibo NetEase Weibo SYDNEY, Nov. 9 (Xinhua) -- A new agreement that allows 31 financial bodies to start using Apple Pay soon is set to benefit about four million Australians, local media reported on Wednesday. Sydney-based financial institution Cuscal Limited said customers with debit and credit accounts held with the 31 credit unions and banks will soon be able to use Apple Pay to make retail payments from their iPhones. An Apple spokesperson told Xinhua that the service for all 31 merchants would be made available "soon" without elaborating much on the time frame. News Corp has reported that Apple Pay's vice president Jennifer Bailey was elated to note that the tech giants payment platform will be available for more Australians to enjoy. "We are thrilled that customers from more than 30 of Cuscal's banks and credit unions, including People's Choice Credit Union, Credit Union Australia and Teacher's Mutual Bank, will be able to enjoy the convenience, security and privacy of Apple Pay," Bailey said. "Today more than 3,500 banks across 12 countries already support Apple Pay and we think Cuscal's customers will really love using Apple Pay for everyday purchases in stores, apps and on the web," she said. Apple Pay are still in talks with three other major Australian bank's who are insisting on operating their own electronic payment applications on the iPhone. The National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank have filed an application to the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission (ACCC) in August seeking permission to collectively negotiate with Apple for their own electronic payments applications to be featured on the iPhone. The outcome of that application is still pending. So far, none of these banks have been offered a spot under the Cuscal agreement as well. At present, Australians can access Apple Pay through American Express and ANZ.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Measure A: Town voters say yes to fire tax — overwhelmingly Tuesday Nov 8, 2016 at 12:01 AM Nov 8, 2016 at 11:45 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — Voters are saying yes to the tax measure designed to bolster emergency services in the town, according to unofficial election results posted at 10 p.m. Tuesday. With more than 34 percent of precincts reporting, Measure A has received overwhelming approval, amassing 10,364 votes, which translates to 77 percent of the vote, according to the San Bernardino County Elections Office. Measure A needed a two-thirds majority to pass. Doug Qualls — former Apple Valley Fire Protection District Chief and Measure A’s principal officer — told the Daily Press things are “going well” in the district as a result of the voting. “The threshold of reaching two-thirds of the voters is an extraordinary effort,” Qualls said. “To get two-thirds of the people to agree on something, and we far exceeded that expectation, that’s by commitment to the community.” Qualls called Tuesday’s outcome the result of a reality wherein fire stations need to be reopened; currently just three of the district’s seven fire stations are opened, and emergency-response times are below the national averages. “In 1997,” Qualls said, “the fire district promised the voters that they would deliver the best service they can deliver with the resources provided. That has held true for the last 19 years. And tonight’s results indicate that the voters have confidence in the Apple Valley Fire Protection District (and) the service that they provide.” Measure A never met any formal opposition; however, San Bernardino County Fire Department Chief Mark Hartwig expressed concern in October over how his department was being portrayed by the campaign that pushed hard to maintain local control. Then, days before the election, the Daily Press learned that the campaign committee behind Measure A potentially violated election law by not disclosing its finances, which totaled more than $15,000. But there was only joy on election night. After the 8 p.m. results were released, Town Councilman and former AVFPD Fire Chief Art Bishop — who was at Measure A headquarters — said you could hear those in attendance “cheering from four blocks away.” “There were probably 75 people there,” Bishop said, “and I’m just so proud of our firefighters and all the people who voted.” Measure A will extend a sunsetting tax voters passed in 1997. Taxpayer dollars collected are expected to be used to reduce 911 response times, improve AVFPD firefighters’ ability to simultaneously respond to numerous emergencies and reopen closed fire stations in the district.

The update includes the new TV app, an SOS emergency function and more.  ( Apple ) Advertisement Apple has released the iOS 10. 2 public beta 2 on Monday, just a week after it released the initial 10.2 beta. The tiny release gap might be indicative that the company is rushing to get this public build to the hands of developers as fast as possible. Chief among the new features introduced in the initial 10.2 beta release is the addition of an organization system for Apple Music alongside star ratings, a Preserve Settings option for the camera and a host of new emoji. The latest 10.2 public beta packs more than just performance improvements or bug fixes, though, since Apple has brought, as promised, the brand-new TV app the company first showed off during the MacBook Pro reveal event back in Oct. 28. Apple is now pushing out the second public beta of iOS 10.2, and if you aren't enrolled in Apple's Beta Software Program, here are the biggest changes included in the latest release. The New TV App For iPhone Apple's new TV app is Apple's own solution to online video for the iPhone, and while Netflix isn't jumping aboard Apple's new proprietary gimmick, there's plenty of partners present here, with a few examples being HBO Go, Hulu and Showtime Anytime to help users find content they want to stream. The app acts as a centralized hub for users who want to find a movie or a TV show they want to watch, upon which the app links the user to the services mentioned above in order to start streaming. Additionally, the TV app can make recommendations based on your history. SOS Emergency Calls The second public beta of iOS 10.2 also brings a new SOS function that connects the phone automatically with emergency services upon pressing the home button five times. Apple's release notes state that the SOS function is available in the United States and a number of countries including Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain and the UK. A Slight Change To The Music App Slight changes have been also added to the music app. Shuffle and Repeat buttons now feature larger buttons instead of icons in the music interface during playback. Also present in public beta 2 are the new emoji with Unicode 9.0 support from the initial beta, as previously mentioned, along with new wallpapers and a new widget for the Videos app. Those enrolled in Apple's Beta Software Program can head over to Settings, tap General then Software Update. Follow the instructions and the new beta will download over the air. Before you can try the new beta, however, you must have Apple's public beta profile installed.

In August, the EU decided Apple had received €13 billion in “illegal state aid” in the form of the tax breaks. When the investigation ended, competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said at the time the arrangements “allowed Apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of 1 per cent on its European profits in 2003 down to 0.005 per cent in 2014”. In a speech to the EU's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee yesterday, finance minister Michael Noonan said the nation will take the case back to court. “The government fundamentally disagrees with the European Commission’s analysis,” he said, “and the decision left the government no choice but to take an appeal to the European Courts and this will be submitted tomorrow” (9 November, 2016). There's good reason for Ireland to try and stay on the good side of the technology industry: Noonan's speech also saw him reveal he's worried about Brexit, because it poses a “real risk to our economy”, with the two countries exchanging €1.2 billion of goods and services each week. Cases of this sort are complex and can't be sorted out over a couple of pints of Guinness. So Even if Ireland loses the case, it will buy time in which to sort out how it continue to offer technology companies a welcoming home. Which might be the point of the exercise. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 51 Comments More from The Register Brandis' boffin-busting de-anonymisation crime legislation has landed Will Australian privacy researchers still be at risk of hard time? 5 Comments Apple pollutes data about you to protect your privacy.

They can be your friends today, but tomorrow they can be your enemies. Some of the companies in fact will be frenemies, said Bill Ford. Legendary Henry Ford, great grandfather of Bill Ford, revolutionised the car industry at the beginning of the twentieth century with the iconic 'Model T' that aimed at providing personal mobility for each individual. A century later, Bill — chairman of the American auto major — faces dilemma of a different kind — the era of personal mobility is gradually being threatened by the concept of shared mobility, led by ride-sharing companies such as Uber and Lyft and championed by tech majors like Google and Apple. Bill, however, finds an opportunity here, and call the New-Age providers more of 'frenemies', who will be future partners and collaborators. Interview with TOI: The auto industry has gone through many turning points over the past few decades, and now we are talking about connected vehicles and autonomous vehicles. Many see manufacturers like Ford as old world companies and more of hardware providers for Silicon Valley companies like Google, Apple. Do you agree? Around 2011, the industry wasn't looking at mobility solutions, but now everybody is racing to invest in them. One thing we don't want to become is like the (mobile) handset where everybody brings in technology and we provide just the hardware. A few years ago, people have predicted that we would become the handset. But now Silicon Valley has a much bigger appreciation for the intellectual property that we actually control — the amount of software development that we have done and integrate into a vehicle. There has also been an appreciation on how difficult it is to make a vehicle and provide the integration of all software. So, you will see a more of a partnership kind of an approach from tech companies towards us compared to what you would have seen till a couple of years ago. Do you think in bigger cities the days of personal mobility are gone. Gradually people will move to shared infrastructure with Uber and other ride-sharing companies? I think the trend is in that direction. To say that it's gone, however, is an overstatement today. I feel there will be more of a (vehicle infrastructure) sharing environment in cities around the world. Outside of bigger cities, you will continue to see more of traditional ownership. So, ride-sharing companies or tech ones like Google and Apple are not a threat? They could be a threat, but they can also be an ally. There is a term in the Silicon Valley called 'frenemies'. They can be your friends today, but tomorrow they can be your enemies. Some of the companies in fact will be frenemies, depending upon which issue we are talking about, and what problem we are trying to solve. Are driverless cars for real? There are many issues like who takes the blame in case of a crash? Autonomous cars are for real, so are the issues associated with them. We have to sort out a lot of big questions before they get mass acceptance — insurance issues, ethical issues about breaking the law. Technology has got a lot of discussion but the decision-making underlining that technology requires a lot more attention. How do you balance growth and sustainability. In terms of green vehicles, what is your solution — electric, fuel-cell, hydrogen? I think all these have their place potentially , but of course the society can't accommodate all at once. Electrification probably makes the most sense, notwithstanding the fact that fuel cells are still worth working on. But, fuel cells are very expensive and very hard to manufacture. Hydrogen is petro-chemically derived and doesn't store well. The big caveat with electrification is that it doesn't make sense to electrify fleets and then have coal-fired electric plants. What is the problem with Ford's India operations? India is a tough market. We brought European and American cars to India and struggled with that. We are localizing more of our business. So, we have a lot to learn about the Indian market to be successful. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

The telecom giant could offer the streaming devices to people who subscribe to the service, according to a Variety report Sunday based on leaked customer-support documents. Consumers who commit to being subscribers for at least three months will be able to get a free Apple TV; those who pay for a single month earn a free Fire TV Stick. The latest Apple TV starts at $149, while Fire TV Stick costs $40. The service may also include channels from previously unannounced companies like Fox, CBS and Univision. AT&T, Fox, CBS and Apple declined to comment. Representatives from Univision and Amazon didn't respond to messages seeking comment. (CBS owns CNET.) DirecTV Now is slated to launch by the end of the year. It will cost $35 a month and boast more than 100 channels, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said at a conference last month. The report, which may not accurately characterize what DirecTV Now will look like at launch, also indicated that DirecTV Now may have some confusing limits. One stipulation may prevent members from streaming some local TV stations on their televisions (using just the kind of devices that AT&T may be aiming to give away). The docs suggest some local networks' viewing may be limited to computers and mobile devices like phones and tablets. Update, 1:20 p.m. ET: Adds Apple TV and Fire TV Stick retail prices.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Apple is now officially a dongle company that happens to make smartphones and computers (Updated) Apple is now officially a dongle company that happens to make smartphones and computers (Updated) By Joel Hruska on November 4, 2016 at 3:41 pm Comment Update 11/4/2016 3:41pm ET:  In response to widespread complaints about its dongle prices, Apple has released the following statement:  “We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple’s USB-C adapters and cables.” USB-C to traditional USB: $9 (was $19) Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2: $29 (was $49) USB-C to Lightning (1 meter): $19 (was $25) USB-C to Lightning (2 meter): $29 (was $35) Multiport Adapter with HDMI, USB, USB-C: $49 (was $69) Multiport Adapter with VGA, USB, USB-C: $49 (was $69). Third-party USB-C peripherals have also received a 25% price cut, and SanDisk’s SD Card reader was slashed from $49 to $29. None of these changes directly address the issues discussed in the post below, but they do relate to Apple’s overall dongle business and consumer unhappiness over being forced to shuck out so much cash for adapters. Original Story Below: It seems that perfection is attained, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to take away. — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry In the five years since Steve Jobs died, I’ve generally resisted the urge to compare his tenure at Apple with Tim Cook’s. Given the long lead times in product development, it was never fair to arbitrarily pick a point and say that this product represented Steve Jobs’ quintessential leadership, while that product represented Tim Cook. That is, until today. Tim Cook has left his mark on Apple, but it’s not the company’s iPhone, iPad, or Mac products that distinguish him from his predecessor — it’s the dongles. Yeah, it’s about like this. The absurdity of the situation is neatly captured by the following fact: None of Apple’s newest laptops can connect to its own flagship smartphones without using a dongle or purchasing a separate cable that doesn’t otherwise ship with any of Apple’ s hardware. I’ve got nothing against dongles. Over the years I’ve been in computing, I’ve purchased dozens, and hung on to dozens more. I’ve still got a few DVI-to-VGA and keyboard PS/2-to-USB adapters hanging around the house, on the off chance that a friend or neighbor will need to retrieve data off a PC that’s old enough to vote. Twist my arm, and I’ll admit I even have a 3.5-inch floppy drive in storage, along with a few floppy drive cables. Dongles are great. Dongles are useful. But dongles were always the antithesis of what Apple claimed the Macintosh was all about. In the early 1990s, Apple mocked Microsoft and the PC ecosystem for being overly complicated and requiring all manner of clutter to actually make hardware function smoothly. Granted, this was always more a marketing play than a demonstration of technical superiority. Macs, too, could be upgraded and extended, and some of those upgrades were necessary if you wanted to use them for certain tasks. But Apple products have historically focused on offering what you needed or would need without requiring you to carry a cable bag. Of dongles and courage I’m not a Mac owner — apart from a corporate laptop I used back in 2008, I’ve never used a Mac as a daily driver. But I do follow the evolution of Mac hardware, and the biggest trend we’ve seen since Tim Cook took over is the proliferation of dongles in the Mac ecosystem. The late-2013 revised Mac Pro kicked off the trend. The 2012 Mac Pro had 5x USB 2.0 ports, 4x FireWire 800 ports, dedicated digital audio ports, four internal drive bays, a SuperDrive, and dual gigabit Ethernet ports. The 2013 Mac Pro kept the dual gigabit Ethernet and swapped five USB 2.0 ports for 4x USB 3.0 ports, but dumped the FireWire 800 standard, dedicated digital audio, internal drive bays, expandable PCIe cards, and the SuperDrive. In their place, it offered 6x Thunderbolt 2 ports and the dongles you’d need to connect your old hardware to the new standard. The Mac Pro (2013) is impressively tiny, but it traded an awful lot of connectivity for its size. PC workstation manufacturers haven’t fallen over themselves to duplicate it, either. In March 2015, Apple unveiled the MacBook Retina, a new machine with just two ports: A USB Type-C port for charging (and everything else), and a headphone jack. Reviews noted this as a significant limitation of the machine, with some publications declaring that the lack of I/O support was a deal breaker. Apple must have liked what it saw from sales figures, because the MacBook refresh earlier this year added a faster CPU, more RAM, and a new “rose gold” color — but not any more ports. Then, in the last six weeks, Apple dumped the iPhone 7’s headphone jack and got rid of everything but USB-C across its entire refreshed line of MacBook Pros, which brings us to the current ridiculous situation, in which the iPhone 7 doesn’t ship with a cable that can connect to the newest MacBook Pro, while the MacBrook Pro doesn’t ship with a cable that connects to the iPhone 7. Given that Apple tends to run its own ecosystem, we’d lay odds that most MacBook owners are also iPhone owners, but the company’s packaged hardware doesn’t reflect that reality. Apple has a long history of dumping standards long before the rest of the PC industry is ready to follow suit. But Jobs and Cook went about it in very different ways. Under Jobs, Apple phased out certain standards, but it was always careful to either replace them with new technologies (the floppy to CD-ROM shift, for example), or to keep standards that gave customers a relatively simple way to maintain the same level of functionality via widely established standards like USB. Were there dongles? Absolutely — but dongles didn’t wield near-total control over your ability to interface with your own hardware. Tim Cook has blazed an entirely different path for himself, and I agree with Chris Matyszczyk at CNET: There was a time when Apple openly mocked this strategy. Now, it’s embraced it. One way of interpreting Cook’s headlong charge into donglehood is to argue that he’s just doing what Apple has always done, but that he’s been a bit too aggressive about it, pulling capabilities across entire product lines where Jobs tended to keep at least a few options open for a longer period of time. Another is that Cook, who started as Apple’s Senior VP for worldwide operations and has a reputation for cost-cutting and supply chain management, realizes how much cash the dongle and accessory market is potentially worth, and is willing to compromise Apple’s design sensibility in his search for additional revenue. While the total amount wouldn’t be terribly large in comparison to the company’s smartphone and tablet business, dongles have proliferated across Apple products in a way that implies they’re there for a reason — and it sure as heck isn’t because the company’s professional customers have been begging to replace integrated SD card slots, HDMI support, and USB 3.0 ports with dongles. We also doubt they’re particularly thrilled with the 16GB RAM limit on the MacBook Pro — a limit Apple has stuck to since it launched its 2010 MacBook Pro refresh. There’s been some discussion, after last week, on whether Apple and Microsoft have switched places, with Redmond pushing the envelope in terms of what PCs could be, while Apple plays it safe and makes fairly modest changes to its hardware. I don’t really think that’s true — Microsoft is pushing Surface into some of the only niche PC markets that have seen sustained growth in the past few years. Gaming PCs, high-end sales, and business/workstation products have all been relatively strong categories compared with the general market, which has taken a beating. Put simply, Redmond wants to go premium because the mass market is still collapsing. Apple’s Touch Bar may or may not prove to be an enduring invention — this article argues that it’s a useful UI advance that’s designed to work with a laptop’s indirect interface, as opposed to the direct interface on Apple’s iPhones and iPads — but we won’t be able to judge that until we see what developers do with the new capability. For now, Tim Cook’s major gift to the world, his enduring contribution to Apple hardware design, seems to be the dongle. We’d humbly suggest he’s holding it wrong misreading Saint-Exupéry. And there’s no missing the fact that under Tim Cook, Apple’s laptops have grown markedly more expensive. To quote Ars Technica’s review of the $1,499 13-inch MacBook Pro: “The Mac Mini is two years old, the Mac Pro is three years old, and the iMac just missed out on a yearly refresh for the first time since the 2012 models came out. The company is serving its entry-level Mac customers by selling them 2015’s laptops virtually unchanged for the same price as it sold them for last year.” When Steve Jobs unveiled and later improved the MacBook Air, he set the standard that PC ultrabooks would strive to follow and best, with varying degrees of success. So far, no consumer product Apple has launched in 2016 has been anything like an equivalent trendsetter. If the future of PCs is a tiny machine and a lap full of accessories, I’ll stick with the status quo. Yes, in the very long run, we may see a world in which USB-C is used for almost everything — but HDMI, USB Type A, DisplayPort, Lightning, and SD cards aren’t going anywhere anytime soon.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Measures V and W both passing in early returns Tuesday Nov 8, 2016 at 12:01 AM Nov 8, 2016 at 11:58 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — Both measures related to the takeover attempt of Liberty Utilities were passing by wide margins in early election returns, according to the San Bernardino County Elections Office. As of 10 p.m., with more than 34 percent of precincts reporting, Measure V has received more than 69 percent of the vote. Meanwhile, in a closer race, Measure W was passing with nearly 56 percent of the vote. Should both measures pass, the one with the most votes will prevail even if the other reaches the 50 percent plus 1 threshold, according to Town Attorney Thomas Rice. Town resident and Measure V proponent Pat Hanson called the results a sign that “the people of Apple Valley have spoken.” “They’ve made it clear they do not support the Town’s ... waste of taxpayer dollars,” Hanson said in a statement. “The passage of Measure V will ensure politicians are held accountable to the people they serve by guaranteeing our right to vote on debt we’ll have to repay.” Hanson also called for the immediate ceasing of acquisition efforts. “The outcome of today’s election is a clear sign the people don’t want the takeover,” she said. “Further, we call upon John Brown to immediately resign as Town Attorney. The Town has already spent $1.6 million on the water takeover effort that will directly benefit Mr. Brown’s firm, Best Best & Krieger, and enlarge his own pocketbook. This clear conflict of interest is proof the water takeover efforts aren’t being made with the interests of Apple Valley residents in mind.” Meanwhile, Pat Orr said H2OWN — Our Water Now — Measure W’s campaign committee, did its job. “Our goal was to pass Measure W, and it’s passing,” Orr said. “There were no illusions that we were going to outspend (the Measure V campaign) or out-communicate them.” In response to Hanson’s comments related to the town and its attorney, Orr said she’s a citizen and can “call for anything she wants.” “Apparently most citizens are siding with the Town Council,” Orr added, “since they’re re-electing the incumbents by a wide margin.” Passage of Measure V would require a vote of the people prior to the town issuing bond debt in excess of $10 million. Measure W, on the other hand, would require voter approval on any town debt over $5 million. Voting would not apply, however, in instances wherein the Council conducts a public hearing, certifies that revenue from projects will exceed debt payments, certifies that debt will not be paid “by the taxing power of the town” and requires annual independent audits. A future vote on the town’s acquisition of the water system would be excluded from the debt limit and safeguards laid out in Measure W because a yes vote equals a vote for acquisition. Measure V was proposed by Hanson and her late husband Chuck, who passed away just one month after the measure — informally titled the “Right to Vote on Debt Act” — qualified for the ballot. While not Liberty customers, the Hansons grew increasingly frustrated with the Council as acquisition of the company’s water system by eminent domain became a reality. After signatures were turned in to the town clerk on May 10, Chuck Hanson told the Daily Press he believed residents were against acquisition. “These clowns are forcing (eminent domain on) us,” he said. “They're not listening to us, and they’re smart enough to know if they have an election it wouldn’t get the results they wanted. That’s why they don’t want an election.” Liberty paid approximately $50,000 to fund Measure V’s signature-gathering process. The company went on to sponsor and fund the measure’s campaign to the tune of $250,000 leading up to Tuesday’s election. Money the company spent paid for an advertising campaign that permeated the local airwaves. Measure W was voted onto the ballot by the Town Council in July in response to Measure V being qualified by 3,873 town voters. The Council came under fire not long after as opponents claimed the town was using taxpayer dollars to spread advocacy of the alternative measure. The town maintained throughout the run-up to Nov. 8 that what it disseminated in a newsletter and mailers was information on the competing measures. Conversely, H2OWN received just over $18,000 in contributions, and the committee took its offensive to social media as a result.

This is no surprise as Microsoft flagged the end of October as the time that would happen, meaning every new PC will only have Windows 10. This is all part of the Redmond master plan to move everyone to an operating system as a service platform in the near future. This would mean that you won't own any of the MS software on your PC but simply renting it. The analyst IDC is complaining that inexpensive tablet devices are killing the market. Apparently 43 million of them shipped last quarter and for some reason that is not good as it is down over 14% from the same time last year. Only Huawei and Amazon showed an increase. Even with drops Apple is still the market leader followed by Samsung but between the two of them they only have around 37% of the market. My view is that the market is saturated at the upper end and all that is left now is the lower side. Where this goes is still up for grabs but the big tablet growth curve is over, at least for now. Everyone panic, there is a shortage of NAND flash chips. This will affect a whole range of devices including cameras and smartphones for up to four months, with the prediction that it won't start working smoothly again until March. I wouldn't expect good SSD drive prices for this same period as demand and low supply also means that prices will rise over the next months until supply can catch up again. The roll-on effects will affect defect replacements, upgrades and the whole supply chain for devices that used NAND technology. So, a few months after the free upgrades ceased how are Windows 10 sales going? According to those who measure this kind of information e.g. Netmarketshare, StatCounter and analytics.usa.gov, Windows 10 adoption has stalled. Over the past three month the increase in market share has been 1% or less. This also means that Windows 7 has stopped its slide and still holds the majority of OS market share. But as pointed out earlier it will not be growing from now on. If you were wondering, yes XP still has somewhere around 6% of the market. I was talking to a Mac seller recently and they were not at all impressed with the new notebook range from Apple. Yes, they are thinner and lighter but they also are less expandable and more expensive than ever. With the current state of the industry do we really care how much thinner a laptop can get or even how much lighter it may be? You will also need to add up the cost and weight of all the Apple dongles and connectors you need to carry removing any weight savings. The top of the line unit has a max of 16GB Ram and will set you back US$4,300. There are no upgrades and then there is the Thunderbolt/USB-C, which some are describing as a "total nightmare". If you want to connect you new iPhone to your new Apple Macbook, you will need the $30 cable. Ports are unlabelled so you could be plugging in your fast devices into the slower ports (on the right) and not know it. If you plug a device into the USB charger port with the wrong cable you could damage your machine. Apple needs to bump up the Ram to 32GB and drop in a couple of USB 3 ports that aren't just for charging to even come close to making the new range useful. The fastest growing industry for Apple these days seems to be the plethora of connecting dongles you need to buy. FitBit stock dropped quite a bit recently. While I am happy with my Chinese equivalent, how many people really need a band on their wrist that counts steps, can take your pulse and one where you need to press a button to see the time? For those interested in web development, HTML 5.1 has finally been made a specification by the World Wide Web Consortium as a "recommendation". You can access the full spec here www.w3.org/TR/html51/. It includes new features, deleted items and changes to existing features. As an example, one feature that many have been asking for is the tag allowing a browser to select the best image for the screen size. Finally for this week, an Accenture survey found that 75% of 2,000 enterprise security practitioners surveyed representing companies with annual revenues of more than $1 billion, were confident they could to stop all hackers getting into their systems. My only comment is that pride comes before a fall. James Hein is an IT professional of over 30 years' standing. You can contact him at jclhein@gmail.com.

We’ve recently talked about ways you could be wasting money without realizing it 15 Ways You're Wasting Money and Not Realizing It 15 Ways You're Wasting Money and Not Realizing It You're wasting a lot of money, and you might not even realize it. Plug these 15 leaks and save hundreds every year! Read More . Let’s continue this conversation and review some simple ways that you can stop wasting money. Whether in the form of mindsets or software, implementing these little tricks will help you keep more cash in your pocket. 1. Have a Price in Mind for Purchases It’s a basic fact that a sale is made when a buyer and a seller agree on a price for a trade. If Apple is selling a MacBook for $1,500 5 Ways To Save Money When Buying a MacBook 5 Ways To Save Money When Buying a MacBook Apple’s MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, or “the new MacBook”, are some of the best notebook computers you can buy.

Take a minute to think about the price you’d be willing to pay for an item before you see how much it costs. If you walk into the store knowing you need a new sweater and can pay $30, don’t buy anything over that price, because it’s not worth it! You can look elsewhere to find a seller that meets your preference. That one minute could save you quite a bit of money. 2. Delay Purchases to Prevent Emotional Buying Humans are really great at talking themselves into actions, which can lead to problems.

One is the household account, strictly for bills and household expenses. She has her own account and I have my own account. We have our paychecks direct deposit a majority of the paycheck into the household account and the remainder into our other accounts respectively. Whatever we have in our own accounts we can spend however we want. Whatever is in the household must be discussed if it is above and beyond the normal household bills. All household debit cards/checks are left at home. When we adhere to this it works great. We just started doing this partway through 2016 and had an unexpected trip which put us in a not so comfortable financial position, so the goal for 2017 is to get back on track. When we reach a certain level in the household account above and beyond what's needed for bills, we'll transfer a percentage into a savings and/or CD. Also, I have a Google Sheet with everything already budgeted out for 2017 with the known paycheck incomes and bill debits. If we purchase anything unplanned, I can add a new line and plug that in and see how it will affect things in the future. Think of a prefilled check register and I just mark the items that clear and keep track of the current bank account balance. Now it's just up to self control and accountability. Reply Doc November 8, 2016 at 6:10 pm Wow. These all seem to be ways of *tricking* yourself into not spending. If you don't have the willpower to *not* buy something, none of these will help. Reply Ben Stegner November 8, 2016 at 6:35 pm Well, that's kind of the point. I can't force someone to not buy stuff, but I can provide ways to help set them up for success! If you find yourself impulse-buying items online, removing your credit card from those sites helps you slow down and may prevent that purchase.

Trending in Apple Poll: What is your view of the all-USB-C ports on the new MacBook Pro? November 4 AAPL: 108.84 -0.99 Opinion: From the enthusiast to the general consumer, Apple’s recipe for success has become boring Edoardo Maggio - 2 weeks ago @northead Opinion Apple View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit [First of all, I would like to say that this is but my very own take, which is not necessarily shared by my colleagues here at 9to5Mac and therefore not an editorial, staff-wise opinion piece. It represents my view and my view only, so try to keep that in mind.] Up until not too long ago, I used to ask myself a simple question: if I were to pick one company — and one company alone — to rely on for all of my “tech needs”, which one would I choose? The answer would come rather swiftly: Apple. As a critic (by nature more than profession) I have always seen the vast majority of products skeptically, but that didn’t take from the fact that the Cupertino giant made what I considered to be the best smartphone, the best tablet, the best computers and even two of the most valid operating systems around, accounting for a sweet, unified and well-connected package that would make me feel like I didn’t have to look outside of it. It was Apple’s dream of ecosystem lock-in, essentially. However, as my view of this universe has got more and more panoramic — especially in the last year of collaboration with the sister site 9to5Google, which has helped me a lot to gain even more direct experience with Apple’s competition — I started to have a feeling that this bubble was somewhat bursting. And this feeling is something I simply haven’t been able to shake, and one that has brought me, like apparently many others, to think that the well-oiled profit machine Apple Inc. may have lost some of its touch, for what concerns the present and, more importantly, the future… Apple has long been one of the giants that, thanks to its focus on hardware, managed to surprise and delight me; before I actually got into tech, I fell in love with iPods, which slowly got me into the magical world of Apple products. I remember vividly the day I unboxed my iPhone 5, and just how much ahead of the rest of the tech world that product was bringing me. From its famous introduction to my own unboxing and the first weeks of use, I just couldn’t believe how much I was loving that little thing. Less than a year later I finally caved in and bought a Retina MacBook Pro, the same machine I’m still typing this very piece on, and again couldn’t help but repeatedly fall in love with my gear — and indeed, if you’re reading this piece right now, Apple’s efforts have played a big part in pushing me towards the lucky place I am in at this point in time. One thing I’m sure of, in fact, is that Apple is still incredibly competent and absolutely fantastic at what it does — say what you say about its products or controversial moves, but there likely is no other company on Earth that has the influence of Apple, and I am actually thankful for their choice of taking the reins and doing things such as eliminating old technologies and springing us towards the future, no matter how inconvenient that transition may be. I do understand the users’ complaints — more on that later — but I also try to fit into Apple’s shoes, and there is a case to be made for doing what they’ve done. I do not take issue with that. Again, looking at their lineup, it still strikes me how a relatively focussed — albeit expanding — portfolio of products still makes it possible to produce such incredible pieces of hardware: the iPhone 7 could still easily be considered the best smartphone around, the iPad Pros are great machines, the new MacBooks have a lot going for them, the 5K iMac’s display still makes my mouth water every time I go to a store and look at it, and hell, I absolutely love my little 6th gen. iPod touch. Apple Store in London’s Covent Garden I see more Apple products around than any other brand’s — living in central London surely helps with this, but there’s no denying that the company’s reach is enviable, to say the least — and I am fairly sure that a good chunk of its customers are extremely happy with their Apple-logoed machines. And yet, after all this sweet talking, I feel like I have to address the main issue highlighted in the title. And that is: Apple is boring. And let me get this straight: Apple isn’t just boring by its own standards, but it’s being trumped by other companies too, big time — and often by names you most certainly wouldn’t expect. A few years ago — two and a half, to be exact — at their annual I/O developer conference, Google announced its new, company-wide design system to rethink not just how the design issue should be tackled within tech, but also how we should actually think of it. Material Design was (and still is) an incredibly ambitious, ongoing project, which for the first time put the search giant into that increasingly important conversation. While watching the keynote, I was simply stunned. I was very hyped when, just twelve months prior to that, Apple was to reinvent its software design with iOS 7, and while Ive’s introduction video became what I deem to be his masterpiece (because yes, of course Ive’s voiceovers are a thing) it was quickly turned into nothingness, kneeling before the scale of Google’s ambition. Indeed, Apple had long been a tech design keystone in both hardware (predominantly) and software (more or less), but seeing what Google was aiming at made Apple’s new software approach seem childish to my eyes. And, beware: I say ‘childish’ not because of its execution — an entirely different matter — but rather in its scope. From that moment on I started reading about this upcoming post-mobile “cross war” between the two behemoths: is Google going to become good at design before Apple nails services? Almost 30 months later, I honestly feel like the answer to that question is yes. Material Design is not perfect, and as Google itself reminds us, it is “never done”, but seeing where the company — and all of its products, starting with Android — was just two years ago and where it is now is, in my opinion, nothing short of incredible. Consistency needs to be addressed, but in this short amount of time the Mountain View firm was capable of doing what many would have thought of as impossible, which is linking the words “Google Design” with “gorgeous”. No, seriously, go take a look. On the other hand, Apple’s services have done wonders for the company, but none of them has had a truly identifiable “wow” moment in my mind. Their biggest investment, Apple Music, has proved to be little more than just another music subscription service, and both iOS 8, 9 and 10 as well as the last three iterations of OS X/macOS have done very little to genuinely impress and enchant me. If anything, the one thing I was excited about — 3D Touch — is the one I have experienced less, as my go-to iOS device does not support it. All in all, each version of the two OSs has mostly looked like a game of very small and incremental catch-ups to me, which I’ve come to realize increasingly more as I noticed that my usage of iOS and macOS was not being drastically altered. Which brings me straight to Apple’s stronghold: products. Remember the question I would ask myself all the time? That question’s changed. Now it’s more like: when was the last time that I was actually thrilled by an Apple product? And, much to my own dismay, the answer is “I don’t know”. It could perhaps be the 2015 12” MacBook, which indeed, for all its shortcomings, had something special to it, but even that would be a choice driven by exclusion rather than absolute, buzz-led certainty. Have you noticed that I haven’t mentioned the Watch even once so far? Such is its ‘forgettability’, in my view. It’s a product that hasn’t caught my attention at launch and that I still don’t see much agitation around for, not even from Apple itself. It doesn’t really make the case for a compelling device, much less an essential one; something that Apple had always strived for. Perhaps at fault, but when the original iPad came out I did think “Yes, I need this” — or at least “I want this”. It was bold, and ambitious, and beautiful, and new. It was so very Apple. But that doesn’t seem to be the case anymore. It particularly struck me when the iPhone 6s came out: somehow, even weeks after the announcement, my Twitter feed was filled with comments regarding that stupid pink color way more than the decidedly more interesting 3D Touch technology. Did Apple fail to communicate its importance? Or had we all rather become so numb not to actually expect anything from Apple given that it was an “s” model? Honestly, I don’t know. What I do know is that whatever magic used to be there has long been absent outside of Cupertino. You know who’s actually making great products? Microsoft. Yes — the same Microsoft we’ve all laughed at because of Internet Explorer or the buggy, crappy versions of Windows running on that fat, plasticky — and now dusty — black laptop somewhere in the corner of your room. Or, well, not exactly the same company, to be fair. Much like Google, 2014 saw a watershed moment for the Redmond mammoth, with the arrival of Satya Nadella and his more or less complete overhaul of the tore-apart, losing and clueless firm Steve Ballmer had left behind him. And oh boy, how much have they changed. But just for the sake of tying it in with Apple, I will simply recall the moment that has caught my attention the most: the iPad Pro introduction, and Apple’s essential bequest of the “Pro” part to Microsoft. “These guys know productivity,” admitted Schiller last year. And it’s sad to say, but it was one of the most memorable moments of Apple’s keynotes in recent years. After all, which product inspired its very creation? Microsoft has also gotten much more aggressive at Apple’s own hardware game, in fact: look at Surface. They may have not cracked it with the first iterations — or, arguably, yet — but the Pro 3 and Pro 4 are fantastic devices. Bold, ambitious, beautiful and new, dare I say. Rings a bell? And they almost certainly didn’t stop there. Look at the Surface Book: it may, again, not be the “ultimate laptop” Microsoft claims, but it certainly is a far more exciting one than Apple’s latest MacBooks. And yes, you guessed it — the Surface Studio is again a more far-reaching and inspiring product than the iMac. Microsoft, it appears, is making a way better Apple-impression than Apple is. It’s now gotten to the point where Microsoft is seemingly addressing those customers that have long prayed at Apple’s altar, and that the company is now neglecting. The MacBook Pro is actually not a “pro” machine, I hear them say. I read that just about over 100 times in 100 slightly different ways — which is striking, to say the least. And bear in mind that all those complaints come from people who have actually used and loved Apple products likely much more than I have, and whose criticisms therefore have much more weight. But yes, even as a “simpler” Apple customer and lover, this saddens me. And as a more seasoned observer, I struggle to see cohesion: Tim Cook said that the iPad Pro eliminated the need for a PC. “No, really, why would you buy one?” he said. But then Apple has come out with three new Pro laptops, the simpler of which is remarkably closer to the 12” MacBook than to its more powerful peers. And then the Air has been all but forgotten. Then again, you also have the iPad Pro (two, in fact), with too many overlapping features and price points and not enough uniqueness to make me understand what exactly they want to be. Jobs put the iPad clearly in between the iPhone and the Mac; now everything seems blurry, confused. And this is only one practical example. Ironically, Microsoft’s ideas of a ‘tablet that can also be a laptop’ and a ‘laptop that can also be a tablet’ make much more sense, because at least they run the same (great) operating system, and most of all know what they want to be. I’m not saying that they are necessarily better devices — that still largely depends on your preferences and needs — but trying to look at it just from an external perspective, I see the Surface lineup as the clear pinnacle of the current hardware game. Apple may still be a leader, but they sure aren’t the most forward-pushing innovator they were before. There is no doubt that Apple is still a company in great shape and with a lot of good going on for it. I am still faithful that something around the corner may at least bring some of that excitement back. There are so many uncharted territories for them, like VR, AR, AI-trailed products like Amazon’s Echo or Google Home — and then god only knows what else, even leaving the rumored car out of the picture. But as things are right now, I feel like Apple has, at least partially, lost its way. I don’t understand whether the dissonance between its virtually endless (and growing!) customer base and their business decisions has made it so that enthusiasts simply couldn’t be their main target anymore, but recent products — be it because of their price, compromises or just better alternatives from other OEMs — make me question whether even your average Joe is the ideal one. Next year’s major iPhone redesign could indeed bring some much-needed fresh air to the game, and I very much look forward to that — and I still hope that much more is to come. Innovation and competition are the best thing this industry has to offer, and Apple can’t afford to battle only at the box office. So please, Apple: stay hungry, stay foolish.

November 4 AAPL: 108.84 -0.99 Apple iPhone captures 103.6% of smartphone industry profits in Q3, according to analyst estimates Benjamin Mayo - 2 weeks ago @bzamayo iPhone 7 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple has recorded an insane mobile phone profit share in the third quarter, according to analysts at BMO Capital Markets. They estimate Apple captured 103.6% of total smartphone industry profits, with Samsung trailing far behind at just 0.9%. The reason Apple can take more than 100% of profits is because the majority of vendors lost money and recorded losses on their smartphone division, such as LG and HTC. On a units basis, Samsung led with 21.7% of smartphones sold with Apple placing second at 13.2% share. This is the first time Apple has recorded industry profits in excess of 100% thanks to Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 recall blunders and strong demand for iPhone 7. Apple and Samsung have been dominating smartphone industry profits for some time, with Apple sitting in the 90%-95% range for several years now due to the explosive growth of iPhone without lowering average selling price. The report said Apple achieved 90% profit share in the same quarter a year ago. A perfect storm of Samsung product mishaps and the launch of a new iPhone enabled Apple to top 100% profit share for the first time. It is unlikely that Apple will be able to sustain levels above >100% long-term. Nevertheless, it is symbolic of the company’s immense size and monopolistic power on consumer’s wallets. With just 13.2% of shipments, iPhone easily laps its competitors — combined — on a revenue and income basis. The achievement comes at the same as Apple is criticised by investors for struggling to grow; iPhone sales growth is slowing dramatically and the company broke its 13 year streak of record quarterly earnings earlier this year. Apple expects to return to revenue growth in the holiday quarter — largely driven by sales of the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.

November 4 AAPL: 108.84 -0.99 Apple drops USB-C adapter prices after pushback from introducing MacBook Pros without USB-A ports, but not for long Zac Hall - 2 weeks ago @apollozac MacBook Pro USB-C View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit The Apple community has had a hard time being content with the Mac lately. First it was the feeling that the Mac line including MacBook Pros weren’t being updated as often as, say, iPhones. A redesigned MacBook Pro helps resolve that with at least one member of the Mac family. But the new MacBook Pro goes all in on USB-C and drops legacy ports like standard USB-A, and many Mac users believe this move is too aggressive considering the cost attached to this transition. The good news is that Apple is listening and lowering the price of its USB-C adapters in an effort to ease the USB-A to USB-C transition, but you have to act fast… Apple’s lineup of USB-C accessories is changing in price starting now through December 31 with a few exceptions: USB-C to USB Adapter ($19 → $9) Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter ($49 → $29) USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter ($69 → $49) USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter ($69 → $49) USB-C to Lightning (1 m) ($25 → $19) USB-C Charge Cable (2 m) ($19) USB-C to Lightning (2 m) ($35 → $29) 29W USB-C Power Adapter ($49) 61W USB-C Power Adapter ($69) 87W USB-C Power Adapter ($79) While charging accessories are not dropping in price, Apple is discounting third-party USB-C accessories sold through its retail channels, including SanDisk’s $49 USB-C SD card reader which drops to $29. It’s unclear how this will affect sales for adapters that have been made recently, but I would advise following up with customer service if you’ve made a purchase in the last week or two. [Update: Customers who made recent purchases appear to be receiving emails alerting them to credits.] Apple tells us that this is the reasoning for the change: “We are extremely excited about the new MacBook Pro, which is the best pro notebook we’ve ever made. It has the fastest CPU, graphics, memory, storage and I/O, best display, the innovative Touch Bar and more. MacBook Pro uses the most advanced industry-standard connector, USB-C with Thunderbolt 3, to provide maximum performance, expandability and compatibility. “We recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. Through the end of the year, we are reducing prices on all USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 peripherals we sell, as well as the prices on Apple’s USB-C adapters and cables.” Third-party companies like Anker, Belkin, and others offer USB-C accessories at competitive prices if you’re looking for cheaper alternatives. Note that Apple’s discount following the new MacBook Pro launch is not permanent.

November 4 AAPL: 108.84 -0.99 Apple also offers limited time discounts on new LG UltraFine 5K and 4K displays for MacBook Pro users Jordan Kahn - 2 weeks ago @JordanKahn Apple View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Following an announcement from Apple today that it would decrease prices of USB-C accessories to help ease the transition to the all USB-C ports on the new MacBook Pro models, it’s also offering discounted pricing on the new LG UltraFine 5K and 4K displays that it introduced to go alongside the new Thunderbolt 3-equipped Macs. The deals get you around 25% off the newly announced displays made for the new MacBook and MacBook Pro models.  The new LG UltraFine 5K display is currently listed on Apple’s website for $974, down from an original listing price of $1299 when Apple first unveiled it at the MacBook Pro unveiling event late last month. The display isn’t yet available to order and is expected to become available sometime in December. A 4K version of the display has been discounted to $524 down from an original $699 list price and is available to order now with a shipping estimate of 5-6 weeks. The 5K display is compatible with and made specifically for Apple’s new MacBook Pros that come equipped with USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports, while the 4K version will work with the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro via USB-C and likely older Thunderbolt 2-equipped Macs with an adapter. The new 13-inch MacBook Pro model is capable of driving one 5K display with a 5120-by-2880 resolution at 60Hz, or two 4K displays with 4096-by-2304 resolution at 60Hz, while the 15-inch model can handle up to two 5K displays and four 4K displays. Earlier today Apple announced it would offer discounted pricing on a number of its own USB-C accessories as well as those it offers from third-parties through both its online and retail stores. Apple said the limited time pricing will last through the end of the year. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Tim Cook has consistently had to endure accusations that the world’s richest tech company has lost its revolutionary sheen. Last week Silicon Valley serial-entrepreneur Steve Blank continued his tirade against Mr Cook saying his promotion to the top spot was “Steve Jobs’ worst decision”. Mr Blank has frequently compared Mr Cook to Steve Ballmer who took over Microsoft from Bill Gates. While Ballmer made highly profitable short term moves, a lack of vision in certain areas meant Microsoft failed to capitalise on important technology trends such as mobile operating systems, search and cloud computing, costing the company in the long term. It may be true that Apple hasn’t released a really innovative product in a while but many hold high hopes for the 10th anniversary of the iPhone next year. Last month Tai Jeng-wu, an executive at Sharp’s parent company Foxconn Technology Group, made comments that Apple could face an “innovation crisis” if its predicted adoption of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays for the iPhone 8 don’t prove to be a hit with consumers. Foxconn is the company that manufactures iPhones for Apple. Apple has been granted a patent for a foldable iPhone Picture: US Patent OfficeSource:Supplied An image from a patent filed by Apple in June 2016.Source:Supplied “We don’t know whether Apple’s OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn’t walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity,” Tai Jeng-wu said. Dedicated Apple leaks website MacRumours has previously declared the iPhone 8 will include a “radical redesign”. It was a prediction that was bolstered by the fact that Apple filed a patent in June for a curved phone entirely enveloped in glass — a design that can be achieved with OLED display. It’s also rumoured that the new iPhone will have wireless charging and the home button could be replaced by a feature that allows users to scan their fingerprint anywhere on the screen. But whether the new device is different enough to replenish the company’s creative image remains to be seen.

That's particularly true of this historic and unusual election, and particularly particularly true in the final days of a close race. That makes Election Day a great time to drop some news you don't want anyone to see. There's all kinds of important or lighter, anxiety-easing stories that fly by while we're all glued to cable news. We understand. There's long lines, polls to watch and FiveThirtyEight maps to endlessly refresh. That's why we rounded up the biggest stories you might have missed right here. Walgreens sues Theranos According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, Walgreens has filed a $140 million lawsuit against Theranos in light of their completely unsuccessful partnership. The failing healthcare startup was once valued at $9 billion — now, hundreds of employees have been fired, its laboratories are shut down, and its largest investors have already sued for fraud. Ireland appeals to claw back Apple's EU tax bill Remember when the European Commission served Apple with a multi-billion dollar tax bill? In the middle of this ongoing back and forth between Apple, the European Commission and an angry U.S. government, seemingly out of nowhere, Ireland has filed an appeal to claw back the tax bill's entire sum from Apple. According to a report from Reuters, the Irish government is keen on keeping their tax laws attractive to international corporations and investments.  Meanwhile, a report from TechCrunch revealed that Apple silently hired 16 employees and acquired tech resources from the now defunct music streaming app, Omnifone, confirming numerous rumors that started circulating last summer. The report speculates that this had a large role in driving Apple Music's revenue growth. Have Brangelina settled on their divorce? Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie may have finally reached a custody agreement, after news of their divorce broke in September. Angelina Jolie has taken sole custody of their five children, ranging in ages from 8 to 15 — although, as US Weekly reported earlier today, whether Brad is on the same page as her is an entirely different question. As of now, all he has are visitation rights. Gourmet French fries — fresh from the backyard Ever been browsing Instagram, seen someone's delicious-looking food and thought, "I really wish I had that right now"? It's not totally impossible if you're in and around South LA — where there's a quietly growing underground community of African-American chefs who use social media to sell home-cooked meals directly to customers. Craig "Mr. Fries Man" Bastille works a day job at Pepsi, but online boasts a constantly changing menu of his creative approaches to fries — including chicken green chili enchilada, buffalo shrimp and pork belly adobo.  The election brings cheap seats Cable news has been loving this election, but all the debates, conventions and endless coverage have put a serious dent in live sports ratings. That also means if you're trying to see a game, you can get a great deal. Weekdays in November are usually sleepy, but resale sites like SeatGeek posted unprecedented low prices — many for less than $20, some for less than $10.

Reuters/Stephen Lam If reports are to be believed, the Apple Watch 3 2017 could feature a camera though not much change in display and design are expected. The Apple Watch Series 2 has already been launched with an S2 chip, water-resistant features and GPS. Now, speculations surrounding the Apple Watch Series 3 are already making rounds. There are speculations that the Apple Watch 3 will be released in September 2017 and it could well be the wearable counterpart of Apple iPhone 8. However, as per Tech Radar, Apple may not find it necessary to refresh its Watch every year. Hence, the Apple Watch Series 3 may actually come out in 2018. As per certain rumoured leaks, the Apple Watch 3 will sport a 1.65-inch micro-LED Display. The Watch may also be OLED though Apple could be considering the micro-LED panel for the wearable simply to provide a boost to the resolution. Apple Watch Series 2 has a crisp display but it’s not razor-sharp. Thus, Apple could be improving the screen in some way or the other though the resolution may remain 390 X 312 pixels. The overall look of the Apple Watch 3 is not likely to change though new case materials might be added. Some believe that the watch will be slimmer and smaller than current models. This seems unlikely as the company may choose to pack in more tech than reduce the size of the wearable. A FaceTime camera is also expected in the Apple Watch Series 3, writes Mobile & Apps. Earlier it was reported that the Apple Watch 2 will have a camera but it didn’t. Hence, Apple may incorporate the plan into its Apple Watch 3. In terms of battery, a minimum of two days of battery life is expected in the wearable. If the Apple Watch Series 3 released late 2017 or early 2018, it could run on watchOS 4 or watchOS 5. A majorly upgraded processor, such as a dual-core S3 chip may also be included. Cellular capabilities could be the big feature in the Apple Watch 3. It may come with its own SIM card and may not be dependent on iPhone. As regards the price of the Apple Watch Series 3, the device may be priced similar to the Apple Watch 2. The Watch 2 was made available in Australia for $529.

Right now the company is only selling a few models of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. A 16GB iPhone 6s can be had for $449 while the larger iPhone 6s Plus is being offered in two storage varieties: 16Gb and 64GB for $529 and $589, respectively. Both devices are available in all colors including Silver, Space Gray, Gold, and Rose Gold. Those prices are about $80 to $110 less than brand new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus devices, although the regular store only offers them in 32GB and 128GB capacities. A brand new iPhone 6s costs $549 for the 32GB model and $649 for the 128GB variant, while the 6s Plus is either $649 or $749 for the 32GB and 128GB versions respectively. All refurbished iPhone 6s and 6s Plus models are unlocked and SIM-free, meaning they are compatible with all U.S. carriers. Apple says these phones are fully tested, updated with replacement parts for any defective modules identified in testing, cleaned and repackaged with cables and other materials you get when you buy a new iPhone. They come with the same one-year warranty as brand new iPhones, and they also feature a brand new battery and a fresh outer shell with no scratches or cosmetic damage. Apple last sold reconditioned iPhones through its official refurb store back in 2008 with the iPhone 3G and has also used an eBay store front in recent years.

On Friday, Nov. 4, 2016, the Alabama State University Board of Trustees voted to place President Gwendolyn Boyd on administrative leave. Boyd is the revered 22nd national president of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc. Boyd introduced to Alabama State University, their first ever engineering program, the first HBCU Presidents Summit on STEM, she was invited to the Thurgood Marshall College Fund headed by Dr. Johnny Taylor to speak at Apple in California as Apple was coming together to celebrate their first cohort of STEM students from HBCUs. “As a college president and an engineer, I was at the event to talk about how companies like Apple can deal with issues of inclusion and diversity. “My message was that problems are solved by a diverse set of people.  If everybody at an organization was trained at the same institution or similar institutions, they tend to look at problems the same way. But if you bring people together who have been trained differently with the same information, trained to look at things differently, or approach problems differently, you stand a better chance to have new product lines, new ways of marketing, new ways of approaching people about what they want in technology.” Boyd was charged with failure to maintain confidence of the board, Provost Leon Wilson, who will serve as interim president, issued a statement. “At this time, it is important that the Alabama State University family remains focused on our top priority and greatest treasure, which is our students. We will continue our educational agenda, and I, along with our leadership team, faculty and staff, will serve our students to the best of our ability. The most important thing for the University right now is to maintain its stability. I ask that the community keep me and our University in its prayers.” A hearing will be held on Monday, Nov. 14, 2016. The board appointed Provost Dr. Leon Wilson to serve as interim president. It appears the firings are the latest trend among HBCUs. Carolyn Meyers (press photo) Carolyn Meyers resigned from Jackson State University in October.

And now, one week later, the company is pushing out the first update for the beta iOS 10.2 release. iOS 10.2 beta 2 is now available for public testers, one day after the same build was downloadable by registered developers. If you're a member of Apple's beta program, you can grab the new software by going to Settings > General > Software Update. Included in this new beta is Apple's TV app, which is meant to help Apple TV owners find things to watch, as well as easily view their purchased movies and TV shows. This app was presented at the company's October event, when it unveiled the new MacBook Pro line. Also new is an Emergency SOS feature, which will contact emergency services when you press the power button five times. Finally, the Music app gets bigger Shuffle and Repeat buttons. The initial iOS 10.2 beta also brought with it some new emoji, new wallpapers, and a new widget for the Videos app. Camera settings can be saved so that they don't always get reset to Auto when you restart the app, and you have a new option to rate music with stars (one to five).

So for some of those phones left over with 16GB or 64GB configurations that have been returned or opened, Apple is going to sell them as refurbished devices with a full-year warranty as well. The prices are about $100 to $110 cheaper than their sealed-in-the-box counterparts. While the new 32GB iPhone 6S and 6S Plus run for $549 and $649, the refurbished models (though with only 16GB) run for $449 and $529, all respectively. Wed stray away from buying any phone with only 16GB of internal storage, for the simple fact that the iPhone 6S shoots 4K video, which only fits about 34 minutes of footage (before installing any third party apps). This is the first time Apples online store starts selling refurbished iPhones in the US at some decently discounted prices. The company would rather sell you a refurbished device with the manufacturers warranty. Then again, Apple has all these 16GB iPhones they have to somehow put to use. All of the refurbished iPhones are tested, cleaned, certified, and guaranteed by the manufacturer for up to one year. Youll also be happy to find a brand new battery inside, as well as a new housing, ensuring the phone has no cosmetic imperfections. They may as well be brand new devices that were repackaged for this purpose, as many consumer electronics companies do. Oh yeah, and if you wanted to score a 64GB iPhone 6S, youre out of luck. iPhone 6S 16GB - $449  Save $80 64GB  Not available refurbished iPhone 6S Plus 16GB - $529  Save $100 64GB - $589  Save $110 Source: Apple Certified and Refurbished | Via Share Facebook Twitter © 2000-2016 GSMArena.com All brands | Privacy | Terms | Contact us Desktop version

By Wayne Williams Published 2 weeks ago 33 Comments Tweet Last Wednesday, Microsoft revealed, among other things, an updated Surface Book. The following day, Apple introduced a new MacBook Pro. Both devices look great, sport powerful innards and come with a suitably high price tag. Which you go for will likely depend on whether you’re a fan of Microsoft or Apple, but if you’re not firmly entrenched in either camp, and need a little guidance to decide which laptop to go for, here are all the details you need. Obviously, the Surface Book i7 and MacBook Pro 2016 aren’t exactly like for like. The Surface Book’s display detaches, for one thing, and it’s touch screen, but let’s see how they compare generally. Design The new Surface Book keeps the same design as the previous one, including the slightly divisive hinge that means the book doesn’t fully close. The screen can detach from the body and be used as a tablet. The laptop has a magnesium alloy body. The new MacBook Pro is -- you guessed it -- lighter and thinner than previous models. It has an all-metal body, and keeps the same simple, but stylish look, albeit with a few tweaks, such as a much larger touchpad. Size and Weight The MacBook Pro is available in two screen sizes -- 13.3-inch and 15.4-inch. The Surface Book only comes in one size -- 13.5-inch. Because Apple is fixated with thinness, it’s no surprise to see the MacBook Pro is the slimmest product at 0.6-inches, versus Surface Book’s 0.9 inches. As for weight, the MacBook Pro weighs in at 3lbs for the 13-inch device, and 4lbs for the 15-incher. The Surface Book is 3.3-3.6lbs, depending on the model (dGPU models weigh more). Display As I mentioned earlier, the Surface Book’s screen detaches, while the MacBook Pro’s doesn’t. The Surface Book only comes in one screen size -- 13.5-inch, while Apple’s product can be had in 13.3-inch and 15.4-inch sizes. The Surface Book offers a higher resolution display -- 3,000 x 2,000, versus 2,560 x 1,600 for the 13-inch MacBook Pro, and 2,880 x 1,800 for the 15-inch model. The Surface Book has a full touch screen, and you can use it in tablet mode. The MacBook Pro has a Touch Bar, a long OLED Retina display that sits in place of the old function keys at the top of the keyboard. You can use this in various ways, and additional functionality will be added in time. Security The MacBook Pro offers Touch ID, so you can log into your laptop using a fingerprint. Surface Book doesn’t have a fingerprint scanner, but does have Windows Hello, which uses facial recognition to log you in. Processors The Surface Book and MacBook Pro can both be had in a choice of configurations, so you can opt for a sixth-generation Intel Core i5 or i7. The Surface Book offers either Nvidia GTX 965M GPU or Intel HD graphics, while the MacBook Pro has Integrated Intel Iris Graphics 540. The larger 15-inch model adds a Radeon Pro (450 or 455) chip for 3D gaming. Input The Surface Book comes with a Surface Pen, so you can draw on screen. That sort of behavior isn’t possible on the MacBook Pro, but you do get the Touch Bar and a super-sized touchpad with pressure-sensitive Force Touch technology. Battery Life If you’re a road warrior, the most juice you can get out of your laptop between charges the better. Apple’s battery life is not spectacular in this case. The new MacBook Pros promise around 10 hours of battery life, while the Surface Book claims between 12 to 16 hours. Storage and Memory The 13-inch MacBook Pro and the new Surface Book i7 are available in 256GB, 512GB and 1TB storage configurations. The 15-inch MacBook Pro can be had with a 2TB SSD. Memory-wise, both the MacBook Pro and Surface Book can be had with 8GB or 16GB of RAM. Ports Apple has come under some fire for its ports choices with the new MacBook Pro. It offers four USB-C ports -- that double as Thunderbolt 3 ports -- which can be used for Thunderbolt, USB, DisplayPort, HDMI, VGI, and charging. (The basic 13-inch model only has two USB-C/Thunderbird 3 ports). This means you may need a dongle to attach certain hardware. There’s no SD card reader. The Surface Book has two full-sized USB 3.0 ports, and an SD card reader. Software Apple's MacBook Pro runs macOS Sierra, while the Surface Book runs Windows 10 -- It’s Siri vs Cortana here. You could opt to install Windows 10 on your MacBook Pro if you want to, but you can’t install macOS Sierra on your Surface Book. Price The price for the entry-level MacBook Pro starts at $1,499, but you won’t get the Touch Bar for that. If you want the new Touch Bar, you’ll have to pay $1,799, which will get you the 13.3-inch display and the Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. The price for the 15-inch MacBook Pro, with Core i7 CPU, 16GB of RAM, and Radeon Pro 450 graphics, starts at $2,399. The Surface Book starts at $1,349, for which you get the Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD. Opt for the i7 version, with 256GB SSD, and 8GB of RAM, and you can expect to pay $2,399. Choose the 1TB version with 16GB RAM and the price jumps to $3,299. Specs: Surface Book MacBook Pro Processor Intel i5, i7 Intel i5, i7 RAM 8GB/16GB 8GB/16GB Screen Size 13.5-inch 13.3inch/15.4inch Resolution 3000x2000 2560x1600/2880x1800 Graphics Intel HD -- Nvidia GTX 965M Intel Iris/-- Radeon Pro 455 Thickness 0.9-inch 0.6-inch Weight 3.3-3.6lbs 3lbs (13-inch)/4lbs (15-inch) Touch Control Full touch screen Touch Bar/Touch ID USB Ports 2 USB 3.0 Type A 2x (13-inch), or 4x (15-inch) Thunderbolt 3 Battery Life 12-16 hours 10 hours Summary For the money, the Surface Book provides a better all round deal, and the screen can be used as a tablet, which is a welcome bonus. The MacBook Pro is a svelte beast, with good looks, and future-proof ports which might require you to use a dongle or two for now, but which will be standard in the coming years. You also get a choice of screen sizes, which can be useful depending on your needs and personal preference. There's no right or wrong answer when it comes to which laptop you should get, only opinion. If you're thinking of buying one of these laptops, please share your reason for doing so in the comments below. 33 Comments Tweet Got News?

Follow TechnoBuffalo For the first time in the company’s history, Apple is selling refurbished iPhones through its online store. Some models are being offered at steep discounts, making the iPhone cheaper than ever. Unfortunately, Apple’s latest models aren’t yet being offered through Apple’s refurbished store. That includes the iPhone SE, iPhone 7, and iPhone 7 Plus, the latter two of which were released in September. If you don’t mind owning the older models, you’re in for some good savings. An unlocked iPhone 6s with 16GB of storage is selling for $449, which is $80 the regular asking price. Meanwhile, an iPhone 6s Plus with 64GB of storage is just $589. That’s $110 less than usual. It could make a good holiday gift With the holidays on the horizon, Apple’s timing couldn’t have been better. There are a variety of ways to get your hands on older iPhone models but going through Apple guarantees quality. Here is what Apple says on its site: We test and certify all Apple refurbished products and include a 1-year warranty. All refurbished iPhone models also include a brand new battery and outer shell. Supply is limited and availability is guaranteed once we receive full payment. As 9to5Mac notes, refurbished models include a brand new battery and outer shell, so you’re essentially getting a brand new device. The devices also come unlocked and SIM-free. All colors and sizes are being offered through its refurbished store.

Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Nov 8, 2016 at 7:57PM Twenty-five years of progress. Image source: Apple. This happens every couple of years; it's just a lot louder this time around. In the wake of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) release of new MacBook Pros, which were unveiled last month, there has been considerable user backlash surrounding the company's decision to completely transition all input/output jacks to USB-C (Apple's implementation also supports Thunderbolt 3). The criticisms aren't misplaced, as creative professionals looking to upgrade to the newest models will undoubtedly be inconvenienced by the sheer number of dongles and adaptors that they'll need for their daily workflow. The irony is that USB-C's potential as a universal port is precisely why the controversy is magnified this time. Apple isn't just swapping out one old port for one new port -- it's swapping out a handful of old ports for one new port. Apple's fastest growing product category. pic.twitter.com/d1sel4N5Yc — Drew Breunig (@dbreunig) October 28, 2016 But at the same time, the decision was hardly unexpected, as there had been months of rumors that Apple would switch completely to USB-C as the port of the future. It's useful at times like these to go back and revisit how Apple approaches which technologies to invest in. That's what he said Steve Jobs made his final appearance at AllThingD's D8 conference in 2010 and discussed the iPad and the controversial absence of Adobe Flash on the tablet. People were outraged that Apple's new device didn't support the standard web video technology of the time. His response to Walt Mossberg really hit at Apple's broader philosophy: Walt Mossberg: What if people say the iPad is crippled in this respect? Steve Jobs: Well you know, I'd say two things. Number one: Things are packages of emphasis. Some things are emphasized in a product, some things are not done as well, some things are chosen not to be done at all in a product. And so different people make different choices and if the market tells us we're making the wrong choices, then we listen to the market. We're just people running this company. We're trying to make great products for people. And so we have at least the courage of our convictions to say, "We don't think this is part of what makes a great product, and we're gonna leave it out." Some people are gonna not like that, they're gonna call us names, it's not going to be in certain company's vested interests that we do that, but we're gonna take the heat because we want to make the best product in the world for customers. We're going to instead focus our energy on these technologies, which we think are in their ascendancy and we think are gonna be the right technologies for customers. And you know what? They're paying us to make those choices. That's what a lot of customers pay us to do. Is to try and make the best products we can. And if we succeed, they'll buy them. And if we don't, they won't. And it'll all work itself out. So far, I'd have to say, people seem to be liking iPads. We've sold one every three seconds since we launched it. It should be clear that USB-C is a technology that is in its ascendancy, even if Apple's switch is seemingly premature given the immaturity of the USB-C ecosystem. A second opinion There's another quote that's a little more directly relevant here, too. This controversy actually started last year, when Apple launched the 12-inch MacBook, which also only uses USB-C. The main difference is that the move is less likely to attract ire in a consumer laptop, while professionals have greater connectivity needs with their tools and workflow. When asked about the decision in a Mashable interview, marketing chief Phil Schiller acknowledged that these types of transitions are often tough and uncomfortable: "We found that the best thing we could do is push boundaries beyond what's expected, beyond what's comfortable sometimes." From an investing perspective, the real question is whether or not this controversy will prove to be a fading argument like all past instances, or if there will be some type of lasting impact on Apple's Mac business. Assuming that the industry indeed moves toward USB-C, which by all signs it is (slowly but surely), it's pretty difficult to imagine a scenario where this hurts Apple over the long haul. One encouraging data point is that Schiller also confirmed in a recent interview with The Independent that demand is soaring: "And we are proud to tell you that so far our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before. So there certainly are a lot of people as excited as we are about it." So far, I'd have to say, people seem to be liking MacBook Pros. It'll all work itself out. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

Job Listings Apple's job listings help give the outside world a glimpse of what the company is cooking up. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 8, 2016 at 6:24PM It's worthwhile to check Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) job listings on a regular basis. Although no big, game-changing revelations are going to reveal themselves there, observers can get a sense of what types of projects and technologies the company is investing more into. Image source: Apple.  This, in turn, can provide some insight into what the future of Apple's products might hold, at least in broad terms. So let's go over three key insights that can be gleaned from the company's current set of job listings. Apple is still bulking up its chip teams On Nov. 3 alone, Apple posted 11 job listings related to hardware engineering. Of those 11, at least nine -- arguably 10 -- were related to the company's chip-development efforts. Apple AirPods. Image source: Apple. It's likely that most of this hiring is aimed to bulk up its A-series smartphone and tablet processors; after all, Apple's leadership in these technologies certainly serves to build a long-term user-experience competitive advantage relative to its competition. However, Apple has also been investing in wireless system-on-a-chip technology. This development might point to Apple's working to build in-house cellular modem efforts, but there's another potential explanation. At the iPhone 7-series launch, Apple launched a family of wireless earbuds known as AirPods. The AirPods, according to the company, includes an Apple-designed wireless chip known as the W1, which Apple's chief design officer Jony Ive says (via 9to5Mac) "enables intelligent connection to all your Apple devices and allows you to instantly switch between whichever one you're using." Apple's wireless chip efforts could very well be in service of future W-series connectivity chips and, perhaps, other technologies that haven't quite been made public yet. OLED is coming soon to the Apple iPhone Apple has put up a job listing for a "display manufacturing supplier quality engineering manager." The individual who ultimately gets this position "will have direct impact on the quality of the next generations of iPhone and [Apple] Watch." Under the "key qualifications," Apple says that it would prefer to hire a candidate with "OLED process experience and/or flexible display module process experience." So if there were any doubts that curved OLED displays were coming soon to Apple's iPhone product lineup, this should squash them. Apple's investing in 3D Perception tech On Nov. 3, Apple posted a job listing for a "3D Perception Algorithm Engineer." According to the listing, the individual who gets this gig "will implement 3D computer vision algorithms using existing hardware blocks (GPU, dedicated SoC) with an emphasis on performance and power." What's more, the listing goes on to say that this engineer will "evaluate existing hardware blocks and contribute to the definition of new hardware blocks." In other words, this listing suggests that Apple is working on getting these 3D computer vision algorithms to work reasonably on current-generation A-series processors. Then, once Apple figures out efficient algorithms to perform the desired 3D perception and computer vision functionality, it will build specialized hardware that can run those algorithms -- and pretty much only those algorithms -- extremely quickly and in a very power-efficient manner, which is important for battery-life purposes.  This is an example of the ability to integrate hardware and software that Apple often brags about. It'll be interesting to see how these technologies work when they are ultimately introduced into future iPhone and iPad products.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Apple so far has relied on LCD screens for the iPhone, but uses OLED panels in other products including Apple Watch and, most recently, the 2016 MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar. Multiple reports claim that Apple is finally ready to make the jump to OLED screens in its iPhones, and there’s more proof coming in that direction, this time directly from Apple. DON’T MISS: What happens if today’s Presidential election ends in a tie? Apple’s most recent Securities and Exchange Commission 10-K filing contains a detail that seems to back up existing iPhone rumors concerning OLED displays. Apple Insider's J.P. Morgan noticed that Apple placed a purchase order with more than a year duration for the first time. The total amount is quite substantial: $4 billion. Apparently, the order coincides with an “off-balance sheet obligation: for the same amount from the third quarter, believed to be a long-term OLED obligation to Samsung for the future iPhone. Samsung is seen as the primary beneficiary of the first iPhone models that will have an OLED display, but competing suppliers including LG, Foxconn’s Sharp, and Japan Display are also making large investments in OLED display factories. Not only is an Apple contract very lucrative for a supplier, but the OLED iPhone will convince other smartphone makers to adopt such screen technology for their iPhone killers. Apple also made a change in its risk related to component acquisition statement. The company said that it might have trouble acquiring certain components “on commercially reasonable terms.” Several factors, including supply availability and cost, may have prevented Apple from equipping the iPhone with an OLED display in the past, but that may be changing.

Stick It In (or On) Your Ear Analyst Says iPhone SE Was a One-Off for Apple PSA: Please Vote View All Editorials → Analyst Says iPhone SE Was a One-Off for Apple Bryan Chaffin @TMOBryan · +Bryan Chaffin Nov 8th, 2016 2:10 PM EST | The Back Page Apple isn’t planning to update iPhone SE, according to well-connected KGI Securities’ analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. In a research note, Mr. Ming-Chi said the device, which was originally launched in March of 2016, won’t be updated in 2017, as Apple looks ahead to September’s iPhone 8. Ming-Chi Kuo is plugged into Apple’s supply chain fairly well, and his prognostications have a solid reputation. It would be a curious choice to me if Apple didn’t update iPhone SE. iPhone SE The iPhone SE is a 4-inch smartphone in an industry dominated by larger screens. When Apple originally introduced this device, the argument was that Apple was looking for a less expensive entry-level device, and that it wanted to satisfy demand from the subset of the market that prefers smaller screens. OK, great. That logic still stands up, so what’s changed? All evidence says that iPhone SE helped goose sales in the first half of calendar 2016. To that end, Mr. Ming-Chi said that Apple would most likely see a further decline in year-over-year sales in 2017 due, in part, to the lack of a new SE model. From a research note, as published by 9to5Mac. Shipment volume in 2Q16 came in higher than expected thanks to upbeat demand for the iPhone SE. However, in order to keep gross margin at a high level and to avoid cannibalization of high-end models, we do not expect Apple to launch an upgraded iPhone SE in 2Q17. Without contribution from a new model, we forecast total iPhone shipment volume will reach 35-40mn units and fall YoY in 2Q17, lower than the 40.4mn units in 2Q16. Why Change Now? Again, arguing from the standpoint that Ming-Chi Kuo is likely right, it’s hard to fathom why Apple wouldn’t update a device when not updating that device is going to lead to lower sales. Heretofore, Apple’s modus operandi has been to make the devices that satisfy customer needs without worrying about cannibalization. Why change that now? There are still people who prefer the smaller iPhone; and, having a current-generation iPhone with a lower price tag helps Apple reach deeper into the market. So why nuke it? Chaffin’s Razor says there’s missing information. For instance, Ming-Chi Kuo could be wrong. Or, Apple has seen sales for iPhone SE diminish in such a way that it’s clear there is little real demand for a 4-inch form screen. Or, Apple is planning something to replace iPhone SE that will take us by surprise*.   Average Selling Price Unfortunately this move may be nothing more than a concern over average selling price (ASP), as noted by Ming-Chi Kuo. Apple CEO Tim Cook noted that he was interested in raising iPhone ASPs during the most recent quarterly conference call with analysts. Ditching the less expensive iPhone model would do that. I hope that’s not the case, though, because it sure seems like a bean-counter move in the face of their being demand for this product. Steve Jobs was always leery of putting bean counters or marketing people in charge of a product company. While that’s another discussion for another time, few (if any) moves from Tim Cook have felt like bear counter moves. Until this one. Maybe. *Just kidding. There are no iPhone surprises any more. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit Tags: Apple, iPhone, iPhone SE 6 Comments Add a comment geoduck November 8, 2016 I’m not sure what it means: My first iPhone was a 5C. Loved it even though it was a one off orphen model. Updated this year to an SE. Love it, but now it might be heading for orphan status too? November 8, 2016 at 2:50 EST PM TitanTiger November 8, 2016 It could mean that the current form factor is done and that Apple will update the 4″ version to look more like whatever the next model is. November 8, 2016 at 3:09 EST PM paikinho November 8, 2016 3 years ago, my middle aged eyes went from being able to read the smallest text 4 inches in front of my face to not being able to read small text except at an arms distance. Some small text has become unresolvable at any distance. The iPhone 5S was fantastic when I first got it, but it has become inconvenient for me now. When I was slightly younger, i wanted a my phone to be even smaller than the 5S. I would have loved an iPhone Nano. This would still be the case if my eyes hadn’t changed, but to my chagrin, my eyes prefer the standard iPhone 7 size. I still have dreams of getting a foldable iPhone so I can have a phone that easily fits in my pockets. And is well protected from screen damage. That would be more ideal for me. But the screen needs to be the current standard size and not the 5SE size any longer… booooo. November 8, 2016 at 4:33 EST PM jaimecerda November 8, 2016 Maybe Apple wants the market to focus on an “Anniversary Edition”? If true then no worries, a “SE” edition might come back by 2018. November 8, 2016 at 6:51 EST PM Bregalad November 8, 2016 I suspect we’re going to see some touch screen innovations show up in 2017 in the form of an iPhone with touch ID integrated into the screen. Doing that would allow Apple to significantly reduce the size of the top and bottom bezels making a 4.7″ iPhone 8 only a little bit bigger than the 4″ SE. If Apple is right, SE customers will become iPhone 8 customers and Tim Cook will look like a genius. If Apple is wrong then people looking for a phone in the SE’s size/price bracket will be disappointed and either keep their old phone another year or find something new on the Android side of the fence.

Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Nov 8, 2016 at 7:57PM Twenty-five years of progress. Image source: Apple. This happens every couple of years; it's just a lot louder this time around. In the wake of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) release of new MacBook Pros, which were unveiled last month, there has been considerable user backlash surrounding the company's decision to completely transition all input/output jacks to USB-C (Apple's implementation also supports Thunderbolt 3). The criticisms aren't misplaced, as creative professionals looking to upgrade to the newest models will undoubtedly be inconvenienced by the sheer number of dongles and adaptors that they'll need for their daily workflow. The irony is that USB-C's potential as a universal port is precisely why the controversy is magnified this time. Apple isn't just swapping out one old port for one new port -- it's swapping out a handful of old ports for one new port. Apple's fastest growing product category. pic.twitter.com/d1sel4N5Yc — Drew Breunig (@dbreunig) October 28, 2016 But at the same time, the decision was hardly unexpected, as there had been months of rumors that Apple would switch completely to USB-C as the port of the future. It's useful at times like these to go back and revisit how Apple approaches which technologies to invest in. That's what he said Steve Jobs made his final appearance at AllThingD's D8 conference in 2010 and discussed the iPad and the controversial absence of Adobe Flash on the tablet. People were outraged that Apple's new device didn't support the standard web video technology of the time. His response to Walt Mossberg really hit at Apple's broader philosophy: Walt Mossberg: What if people say the iPad is crippled in this respect? Steve Jobs: Well you know, I'd say two things. Number one: Things are packages of emphasis. Some things are emphasized in a product, some things are not done as well, some things are chosen not to be done at all in a product. And so different people make different choices and if the market tells us we're making the wrong choices, then we listen to the market. We're just people running this company. We're trying to make great products for people. And so we have at least the courage of our convictions to say, "We don't think this is part of what makes a great product, and we're gonna leave it out." Some people are gonna not like that, they're gonna call us names, it's not going to be in certain company's vested interests that we do that, but we're gonna take the heat because we want to make the best product in the world for customers. We're going to instead focus our energy on these technologies, which we think are in their ascendancy and we think are gonna be the right technologies for customers. And you know what? They're paying us to make those choices. That's what a lot of customers pay us to do. Is to try and make the best products we can. And if we succeed, they'll buy them. And if we don't, they won't. And it'll all work itself out. So far, I'd have to say, people seem to be liking iPads. We've sold one every three seconds since we launched it. It should be clear that USB-C is a technology that is in its ascendancy, even if Apple's switch is seemingly premature given the immaturity of the USB-C ecosystem. A second opinion There's another quote that's a little more directly relevant here, too. This controversy actually started last year, when Apple launched the 12-inch MacBook, which also only uses USB-C. The main difference is that the move is less likely to attract ire in a consumer laptop, while professionals have greater connectivity needs with their tools and workflow. When asked about the decision in a Mashable interview, marketing chief Phil Schiller acknowledged that these types of transitions are often tough and uncomfortable: "We found that the best thing we could do is push boundaries beyond what's expected, beyond what's comfortable sometimes." From an investing perspective, the real question is whether or not this controversy will prove to be a fading argument like all past instances, or if there will be some type of lasting impact on Apple's Mac business. Assuming that the industry indeed moves toward USB-C, which by all signs it is (slowly but surely), it's pretty difficult to imagine a scenario where this hurts Apple over the long haul. One encouraging data point is that Schiller also confirmed in a recent interview with The Independent that demand is soaring: "And we are proud to tell you that so far our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before. So there certainly are a lot of people as excited as we are about it." So far, I'd have to say, people seem to be liking MacBook Pros. It'll all work itself out. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

Apple starts selling them for 15% off Think iPhones are too expensive? Apple starts selling them for 15% off By Parker Wilhelm Mobile phones   Grab a refurbished iPhone 6S or 6S Plus online Shares Looking to save on a new iPhone? What if you could get one for less than what the Apple Store would charge you – or without having to brave the front lines on Black Friday for a discount – but still get it directly from Apple? Apple has added smartphones to its list of refurbished goods for sale on its online store, meaning users can get a like-new iPhone for less, direct from the maker. This isn't the first time Apple has done this, notes The Verge, but it's clearly been a few years.  In the past, Apple has offered other refurbished goods at its website –  primarily MacBooks and iPads – but now a 16GB iPhone 6S or 64GB iPhone 6S Plus can be yours for $100 and $110 off the factory-fresh price respectively. Good as new? Despite being refurbished – meaning the phones were returned or traded-in by users and then tested and distributed for resale by the manufacturer or vendor – Apple's out-of-box phones come with a few assurances. First off, Apple's refurbished handsets have brand-new batteries and casing, meaning they won't look used, or die out after an hour's use. Additionally, Apple's refurbished phones are unlocked, SIM-free, and include a one-year warranty as a bonus. That warranty alone can take the sting out of getting a non-factory sealed phone, should something go wrong. Refurbished iPhones from Apple are currently only available in the US, though UK and Australian buyers can still snag secondhand iPods, Macs, and even iPads, which Apple has offered for some time. On that note, it appears that Apple's supply of trade-in iPhone 6S handsets may be from the company's recently announced iPhone Upgrade Program, as 9to5Mac points out. If so, that means stock could dry up fast – so get on it quick!

Registered developers can now download the second beta build that is expected to address certain issues found in the first beta build and the official macOS Sierra 10.12.1.  According to Cult of Mac, the new beta build has fixes for bugs that Apple developers have identified since the new Mac OS was released to the public back in September. The new beta is also said to bring performance enhancements to make the user experience of macOS Sierra more seamless.  Registered developers can readily download the new software from Apple’s Developer Center. For those who already have the previous beta installed on their Mac device, they can grab beta 2 directly from the Mac App Store via the software update mechanism.  Related Stories Apple Campus 2 Could Be Done Soon Apple Eliminates Fake Apps From iOS App Store Apple Not Releasing iPhone SE Successor In 2017? The new macOS Sierra 10.12.2 beta is unlikely to come with new features, since the first beta already introduced them when it was launched to developers and public beta testers. As per MacRumors, what users can expect from the upcoming update based on the first beta is the new set of Unicode 9-based emojis.  Apart from the new characters like clown face, face palm, drooling face and fox face, among many others, Apple has also reportedly enhanced the artwork of existing emojis to make them appear more detailed and realistic than the very cartoonish appearance they currently have with macOS Sierra 10.12.1.  The same set of emojis has been confirmed to roll out to the iPhones and iPads via the upcoming iOS 10.2 software update. As previously reported, iOS 10.2 is bringing new Music sorting options and Star Ratings to the Music app. There will also be improvements in the Camera app and Siri, as well as a new widget for the Videos app and a different headphone icon for the status bar.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

For now, only developers and beta testers have the privilege of having access to the features and new implementations the new beta build has in store.  According to MacRumors, just a day after seeding the new iOS 10.2 beta to developers, the Cupertino giant is now rolling it out to authorized public beta testers who are eager to test out and uncover what changes the upcoming update will bring to iOS 10-running devices.  Based on the information gathered after the beta was released to enrolled developers, the second iOS 10.2 comes with the new TV app that was launched alongside the new MacBook Pros during Apple’s Oct. 27 event. The new app serves as a TV guide for users of Apple TV since it is meant to assist users in finding new content based on the TV shows and movies they previously watched.  Related Stories Apple Campus 2 Could Be Done Soon Apple Eliminates Fake Apps From iOS App Store Microsoft Selfie App Arrives In Android Play Store Another new feature that’s been leaked by beta 2 is the SOS feature that allows users to make emergency calls by simply pressing the power button five times. However, this feature will not be available to all, since release notes indicate that it will work only in the U.S., the U.K., Australia, Canada, Russia, Italy, France, Spain, Belgium, Brazil, Hong Kong, India, Japan and China. The second beta of iOS 10.2 also brings changes to the Music app. The changes are not very drastic; they simply pertain to the design tweaks that make the Shuffle and Repeat buttons more prominent in the app’s interface.  Meanwhile, the standout feature of the upcoming update that was actually leaked by the first beta version is the collection of new and enhanced emojis. As per AppleInsider, the new emojis conform with Unicode 9.0. The Apple-centric news site also revealed that certain changes to the Preserve Camera and Accessibility settings have been made. Furthermore, three new wallpapers and a new widget for the Videos app are also arriving via the iOS 10.2 update.  For a hands-on experience with the iOS 10.2 beta, people who are enrolled in the Apple Beta Software Program can download the software over-the-air. Since betas tend to be very unstable and rife with bugs, beta testers are advised to install the software on a secondary device.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

ROGERS Apple MacBook Pro late 2016. Photo courtesy of Apple - + In the days following the announcement of the latest MacBook Pro computers, reports followed the usual pattern. The MacBook Pro misses the boat; Apple is doomed; Tim Cook should be replaced; and there were the usual questions about "what would Steve Jobs have done/said/thought?". An Apple product is like an iceberg: only a small part is visible above the surface; most is hidden. Some questioned the 16GB maximum memory in these Macs. When asked why 32GB was not an option, Phil Schiller said that this was because it "wouldn't be power-efficient enough for a notebook". Many thought this was another example of Schiller-speak, until IT journalists did some research. When Intel releases suitable Kaby Lake processors, things will be different. Although processor speeds have not changed much, components work faster: bus speeds are improved and sequential read speeds for the solid state drives' read/write speeds are 3.1 and 2.1GB per second. Many commented on the provision of USB-C ports only (plus the headphone connector), which means those with older devices will need new adapters or cables. Apple eased the pain a little at the end of last week by reducing prices in the USA of several adapters. There is no information about whether these lower prices will hold here. There are also reports that some older Thunderbolt 3 adapters with Texas Instruments controller chips do not work. Commentators expect this will be fixed with a firmware update. Apart from the higher prices (I will be mortgaged into the next century by the 13-inch model I want), a surprise for me was the lack of a start-up chime. As these new Macs have instant-on capabilities, this was silenced in case anyone starts the Mac up in a meeting, although I have heard plenty of Macs and PCs being booted up here and no one seems to care. Fortunately, the reliable Christian Zibreg (iDownload Blog) outlined the process to bring the chime back using Terminal. This will be one of my first acts after configuration, when I am able to buy one. If anyone in Thailand wants one of these new computers now, the Buy buttons on the Apple site are still greyed out. Orders in the USA are showing wait times of four or five weeks. I am sort of hoping for a late November release here, but I am not a betting man. I am learning more about the Apple Watch Series 2 that I am running, not the least is how to take screen shots. I now hold the watch's side button and immediately press the crown. The iPhone 7 also needs some dexterity with a press to the side (screen off) button, followed by a touch on the Home button. If you press the Home button first, Siri offers to help. I am pleased with the improved battery life of the Watch. With the first version I would expect to see around 50-55% of life at the end of the day; but the Series 2 is rarely below 75%. I am the wrong person to ask about battery life as my iPhone is in constant use all day, especially with messaging: as before, the Apple Watch takes some of the slack there when I am travelling (bus, taxi, BTS) allowing me to filter out less important messages, or reply sometimes with an emoji. There are now more apps that run on the Watch, like my Withings app that displays several health monitoring data items. Information is taken from Apple's Health app and from devices such as the blood pressure measurement unit I use. I have also added a new maths app, 6284 Calc, by Amit Kalra (@AMITNKALRA), a 16-year-old student from San Francisco who fell behind in class. He built the app to help him, which I think is a greater achievement than unsuitable classroom learning. This is still being developed and it is expected more features will be added. Another neat app is Night Sky 4, which shows stars in the sky from whichever direction the watch is pointed. Remember there are some below the horizon: these are shown too. The display on the iPhone is much clearer of course, but on the watch I can see quickly which stars (and constellations) I am looking at. Heart rate, music, phone and calendar are among the apps I have added to the Dock, giving me quick access to these services. I also have Maps directions on the Dock, which can be automatically opened on the iPhone for a better view when I want it. A quick glance at the watch is often enough to help me navigate the streets without constantly looking at the iPhone. Graham K.

Job Listings Apple's job listings help give the outside world a glimpse of what the company is cooking up. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 8, 2016 at 6:24PM It's worthwhile to check Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) job listings on a regular basis. Although no big, game-changing revelations are going to reveal themselves there, observers can get a sense of what types of projects and technologies the company is investing more into. Image source: Apple.  This, in turn, can provide some insight into what the future of Apple's products might hold, at least in broad terms. So let's go over three key insights that can be gleaned from the company's current set of job listings. Apple is still bulking up its chip teams On Nov. 3 alone, Apple posted 11 job listings related to hardware engineering. Of those 11, at least nine -- arguably 10 -- were related to the company's chip-development efforts. Apple AirPods. Image source: Apple. It's likely that most of this hiring is aimed to bulk up its A-series smartphone and tablet processors; after all, Apple's leadership in these technologies certainly serves to build a long-term user-experience competitive advantage relative to its competition. However, Apple has also been investing in wireless system-on-a-chip technology. This development might point to Apple's working to build in-house cellular modem efforts, but there's another potential explanation. At the iPhone 7-series launch, Apple launched a family of wireless earbuds known as AirPods. The AirPods, according to the company, includes an Apple-designed wireless chip known as the W1, which Apple's chief design officer Jony Ive says (via 9to5Mac) "enables intelligent connection to all your Apple devices and allows you to instantly switch between whichever one you're using." Apple's wireless chip efforts could very well be in service of future W-series connectivity chips and, perhaps, other technologies that haven't quite been made public yet. OLED is coming soon to the Apple iPhone Apple has put up a job listing for a "display manufacturing supplier quality engineering manager." The individual who ultimately gets this position "will have direct impact on the quality of the next generations of iPhone and [Apple] Watch." Under the "key qualifications," Apple says that it would prefer to hire a candidate with "OLED process experience and/or flexible display module process experience." So if there were any doubts that curved OLED displays were coming soon to Apple's iPhone product lineup, this should squash them. Apple's investing in 3D Perception tech On Nov. 3, Apple posted a job listing for a "3D Perception Algorithm Engineer." According to the listing, the individual who gets this gig "will implement 3D computer vision algorithms using existing hardware blocks (GPU, dedicated SoC) with an emphasis on performance and power." What's more, the listing goes on to say that this engineer will "evaluate existing hardware blocks and contribute to the definition of new hardware blocks." In other words, this listing suggests that Apple is working on getting these 3D computer vision algorithms to work reasonably on current-generation A-series processors. Then, once Apple figures out efficient algorithms to perform the desired 3D perception and computer vision functionality, it will build specialized hardware that can run those algorithms -- and pretty much only those algorithms -- extremely quickly and in a very power-efficient manner, which is important for battery-life purposes.  This is an example of the ability to integrate hardware and software that Apple often brags about. It'll be interesting to see how these technologies work when they are ultimately introduced into future iPhone and iPad products.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

November 8 AAPL: 111.06 0.65 Apple Pay comes to over 30 new credit unions & banks in Australia, Orange Cash in France Chance Miller - 7 days ago @ChanceHMiller Apple Pay View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple Pay has been slow to gain traction in Australia as Apple fights with the large banks for adoption. Now, however, Apple has signed a deal with payments group Cuscal that will see the mobile payments service come to more than 30 credit unions and small banks in the country. Apple also today added Orange Cash in France to its list of banks that support the service. According to a report from news.com.au, the partnership will see Apple Pay comes to over 4 million users in Australia, with the number of Cuscal customers supporting the platform expected to continue to grow. Notable inclusions are Credit Union Australia, Bank Australia, Teachers Mutual Bank Limited and People’s Choice Credit Union. The full list can be found here. In a statement, Cuscal managing director Craig Kennedy explained that he hopes the partnership will encourage major banks and institutions to resolve their differences with Apple and put the goo  d of the consumer at the forefront of efforts. “I hope that Apple and the banks find some middle ground here because I think it would be everybody’s interest if they found a solution for their current stalemate,” Mr Kennedy said. “The more people use these services and the more cards that are in there, the more common that it becomes and it lifts everybody. “Whenever you’ve got a few people doing it, it’s going to hold back the growth and the acceptance of this sort of behaviour. And I don’t think that’s in the interests of any of the parties that are currently in dispute. “I hope they find a way through all of that.” Apple Pay head Jennifer Bailey also commented on Apple’s partnership with Cuscal, explaining that Apple wants as many Australians as possible to use Apple Pay. Bailey also explained that the partnership will bring Apple Pay not only to retail stores, but also to apps and websites. “We want as many Australians as possible to be able to use Apple Pay,” she said. “Today more than 3500 banks across 12 countries already support Apple Pay and we think Cuscal’s customers will really love using Apple Pay for everyday purchases in stores, apps and on the web.” In addition to the new credit unions and institutions that come as part of the Cuscal partnership, Apple Pay is supported in Australia by ANZ and American Express, while other banks are also working to gain approval to partner with Apple to support the service.

Samsung Rival Patents Advanced Mapping System For The iPhone By Corazon Victorino On 11/08/16 AT 6:52 PM Close Apple has just been granted a new patent for “augmented reality maps” by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. This new patent appears to be a snippet of what the Cupertino giant could have been preparing all along, ever since CEO Tim Cook stated months ago that augmented reality is bigger than virtual reality.  On Tuesday, patent 9,488,488 — filed back in Feb. 12, 2010 — was published on the United States Patent website. Based on the abstract of the document, the patent is for a technology that lets a “handheld communication device” capture and show real-time video stream of the environment upon detection of “geographic position, camera direction and tilt of the image capture device.” Simplifying what the document states, AppleInsider says the technology being described in the patent is a mapping system that presents real-time augmented reality views of a user’s surrounding environment. The Apple-centric news site also indicated that an advanced sensor is used by this technology to gather digital information, such as street names, points of interest and other elements that are overlaid on top of the live video being captured by a smartphone’s camera.  Related Stories Apple Eliminates Fake Apps From iOS App Store Jet White iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus: Apple May Reportedly Add Color Option Microsoft Selfie App Arrives In Android Play Store To use the technology, a user should launch the Maps app and open the AR feature that activates the rear camera. The mapping system then works by correlating data from several components of the iPhone like the digital compass, gyroscope, accelerometer and GPS. The system is also said to provide users with a seamless AR experience when switching from live video to bird’s eye view. In the patent, augmented reality is described as a technology that supplements reality with additional information. The implementation of this technology would be visible in the points of interest and objects that will appear on top of a video feed of the surroundings. In terms of its practicality, the “augmented reality maps” are said to come in handy for users visiting a foreign city.  The emergence of this new patent comes months after Tim Cook exclusively spoke with ABC News’ “Good Morning America” and revealed that augmented reality (AR) is going to be the bigger technology than virtual reality (VR) in the near future.  "There's virtual reality and there's augmented reality -- both of these are incredibly interesting, but my own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far,” Cook said at the time. "Virtual reality sort of encloses and immerses the person into an experience that can be really cool, but probably has a lower commercial interest over time.”   Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

When asked whether the Government was right to appeal the ruling that Apple should pay €13 billion in back tax, 47 per cent said yes, 39 per cent said no. With the majority clearly in hand, Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan will file their appeal with the European Union Court tomorrow over Apple's record 13 billion-euro (US$14.4 billion) tax bill that will potentially triggering years of litigation.   Bloomberg reports that "The nation will file its appeal against the European Commission's decision to force Ireland to claw back alleged tax subsidies, in a case that will test the EU's powers to use state aid law in what governments argue are national affairs."   The challenge at the EU General Court in Luxembourg will join a handful of pending appeals by other EU nations and companies that received similar decisions in the past year, targeting tax rulings regulators deemed to be unfair. The EU's Apple decision was the biggest ever state-aid payback demand.   Earlier today Noonan said at the European Parliament in Brussels that "The government fundamentally disagrees with the European Commission's analysis and the decision has left the government no choice but to take an appeal to the European courts, and this will be submitted tomorrow."   Reuters noted back in September that the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) will also be the court in any appeal that Apple brings forward as well.   "The court usually backs the Commission, but lawyers say it sometimes disagrees in state aid cases where it usually comes up against countries. Some lawyers say ECJ judges are influenced by political considerations and that if the Commission's rulings prompt a major spat with the United States and member states don't support the Commission, the court may hesitate to enforce a tax demand of up to 13 billion euros plus interest.   However, so far, the big guns of France and Germany have voiced support for the Apple ruling. In Apple's specific case, the UK declined comment.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Earlier today, Apple began selling refurbished iPhone models on its U.S. online store for the first time. For those unfamiliar, refurbished items are generally items that have either been returned or subject to repairs. That said, Apple ensures that ever refurbished item it sells is up to par with the company's internal standards for quality and performance. Additionally, refurbished items from Apple come with a one-year warranty. DON'T MISS: Evidence suggests Apple is working on the biggest mobile game-changer since the original iPhone As it stands now, the only refurbished iPhone models available are of the iPhone 6s variety. Still, the savings are such that you might want to take a look at what's available if you're not married to the idea of having Apple's latest and greatest. Specifically, you can pick up a 16GB iPhone 6s for $449, a 16GB iPhone 6s Plus for $529 and a 64GB iPhone 6s Plus for $589. Sure, you can get these devices for a lot less on sites like Craigslist or eBay, but sometimes it's worth paying a bit extra for that warranty, a seamless return process, and in turn, peace of mind. What's more, each device comes with free shipping and free returns. Even better, the wait time for new orders is just about 2 days and all colors are available.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 8, 2016 at 3:16PM Highly respected microprocessor analyst David Kanter recently posted an article on his website, Real World Tech, detailing an interesting discovery. He says Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has finally managed to design its own graphics processing unit (GPU) for integration into its A-series chips used inside both its iPhone and iPad series of products. Image source: Apple.  Perhaps more surprisingly, Kanter says that Apple launched its first custom graphics processor design inside the A8 chip that powered the iPhone 6-series smartphones. The company has presumably iterated upon that original design with the graphics processors found inside Apple's A9 and A10 Fusion chips released in subsequent years. Before building its own graphics processor, Apple relied on designs produced by graphics specialist and longtime Apple supplier Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF). Let's take a closer look at what Apple's custom graphics processor means for Imagination Technologies, if anything. Imagination Technologies still in the loop Kanter begins with an explanation of the three major components of a typical GPU: A modern GPU, like the ones inside Apple's iPhone and iPad, has three major components that must all work together in harmony to render a scene. The first is the fixed-function graphics hardware, which is responsible for tasks like processing API commands, triangle rasterization, and raster output. The second is the shader core, which is the heart of the GPU and executes programmable shaders (e.g., vertex, geometry, pixel, and compute shaders). Last, the graphics driver is the software that runs on the CPU and ties everything together, coordinating the activities of the GPU. According to Kanter, although much of Apple's graphics processor design is custom, there's still quite a bit of technology inside the design that comes from Imagination. Here's Kanter with more details: Apple's GPU appears to still use some of the PowerVR fixed-function graphics hardware. However, based on a variety of public evidence, it is clear that Apple has replaced the programmable shader cores with their own more efficient and higher performance design. To take advantage of the custom shader cores, Apple also developed their own driver and compiler to emit code for its architecture. The overall result is that while Apple's GPU shares some heritage with PowerVR, it is a unique and proprietary design. What's interesting is that Imagination Technologies didn't report anything unusual from a licensing or royalty payment perspective as Apple transitioned from the A7 chip to the A8 chip. Indeed, during Imagination's fiscal year ended on April 30, 2015, the company reported royalty revenue growth of 9%. The company said unit shipments from non-MIPS processors -- in other words, Imagination's PowerVR graphics -- were flat year over year while the average royalty rate in non-MIPS processors went up because of "a better mix." If Apple's move to more customized GPU technology led to a significant reduction in per-unit royalty payments to Imagination Technologies, then the company's average non-MIPS royalty rate should have gone down rather than move up 9%. Apple is a large enough customer of Imagination's that a significant content reduction in Apple's devices would lead to a large drop in non-MIPS royalty revenue. Investment takeaway The conclusion, at least for now, is that even though Apple has built up significant graphics technology expertise in-house, it still relies on valuable intellectual property that Imagination Technologies developed. Since Imagination's PowerVR licensing and royalty performance have apparently been unaffected by Apple's move to a custom graphics processor, it might be reasonable to expect Imagination Technologies to continue to collect royalty payments for the foreseeable future, even as Apple continues to advance its own graphics processor designs.

At KansasFest, internet archivist Jason Scott told me that the people still using Apple IIs do it earnestly, as a “nonironic” expression of their passion for one of the most groundbreaking computers ever created. "The Apple II fanatics here, the programmers of Apple IIs, the people who have Apple IIs that they're just bringing here to have repaired or to learn more, everybody is coming at it with the sense that this is some part of my life,” Scott said. “Either a minor or a major or a forgotten part of my life. And they're here, they're not judged, everyone loves what they're doing. It's not a stepping stone to something else." Image: John Brooks And so the September release of ProDOS 2.4 was huge news in the small but passionate Apple II community. What is ProDOS 2.4? It’s a fanmade operating system update for the computer, the first in 23 years. The operating system runs faster than ProDOS 2.0.3, which Apple released in 1993. It also adds native support for older 5.25” floppy disks on “newer” Apple IIs from the late 80s and early 90s, a hugely convenient feature for a community that is trying to copy and preserve old software before it is lost forever. Apple II users no longer have to dual boot their computers to run those programs and can more easily copy them to USB drives. Making it was a feat of modern programming skill and competency—each and every byte of memory usage had to be allocated precisely due to the computer’s performance limitations, each line of code vetted to make sure it was as efficient as possible. “There’s very little memory ProDOS is available to live in,” John Brooks, ProDOS’s programmer, told me. “It was a scramble to find every byte I could. I was writing functions that would take 50 bytes or something, but I only have 700 total to play with. It had to be rewritten between 150 and 200 times to squeeze everything in there.” Brooks, who used to code Sega Genesis games for Electronic Arts, started coding his own Apple II+ in 1979, when he was 10 years old. He says that he started work on ProDOS out of a sense of nostalgia, and a desire in the community to preserve older programs before the floppy disks they came on degraded. “I have a collection of 1,000 5.25” floppies in a storage room that need to be migrated to modern computers—programs I had written or things that were unique. More and more of them are becoming unreadable because they’re physically deteriorating,” he said. “Those are records of the dawn of an era that we’re never going to get back if we don’t save them. I want to preserve as much of that as possible.” Scott, for his part, said that ProDOS 2.4 is the “OS news of the year.” “This upgrade is a valentine not just to the community who makes use of this platform, but to the ideas of hacker improvement calling back decades before 1993,” Scott wrote in a blog post announcing the release. “The amount of people this upgrade benefits is relatively small in the world.” Topics: Comfort Content, apple ii, internet history, history, apple, Kansasfest, culture Contact the author by email or Twitter.

All three major labels have signed licensing deals with the service, which was originally announced last year, as have independents Merlin, PIAS, Believe Digital and InGrooves.   Magic Works, the London-based company behind Electric Jukebox, says deals have also been signed with all major pan-European publishing licensors, including Universal Music Publishing Group, Sony/ATV, Warner/Chappell Music, PRS For Music and SACEM, and that it plans to rollout out the service into international markets in 2017.      “I’m trying to make music streaming as simple as buying a toaster,” Magic Works CEO Rob Lewis tells Billboard. The first models -- available in three colors, red, blue and charcoal, each with a built in microphone to enable voice search -- go on sale in the U.K. tomorrow (November 09) and cost £169.00 ($209) for the device and a year of access to the company's catalog of music. After that year, owners will need to pay £52.00 ($64) for a yearly ‘premium pass,’ which enables on-demand access to the full catalog. Users who choose not to renew their subscription after 12 months will still be able to use the service, but will only be able to access editorially curated and celebrity playlists, supported by advertising.   Sheryl Crow, Robbie Williams and British TV personalities Stephen Fry and Alesha Dixon are among the ‘celebrity curators’ signed up at launch, all of whom are shareholders in the business. Sheryl Crow has even filmed a cheery, demonstrative trailer of how the Electric Jukebox works for its website.       Prior to launching Electric Jukebox, Lewis was founder and CEO of Omnifone, a digital music company that partnered with Swedish telecoms provider Telenor in 2007 to launch one of the first mobile music subscription streaming services.   Lewis exited Omnifone -- which filed for bankruptcy earlier this year and quietly bled some talent to Apple -- several years ago, and is keen to point out that Electric Jukebox is an entirely different proposition to mobile-based streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music, TIDAL, Deezer and Amazon. Whereas they largely target young, music and tech savvy millennials, Electric Jukebox is after what Lewis calls the casual and older music fans, who have yet to sign up to a monthly subscription service and, he says, are never likely to.   “The reality is that after 11 years of pushing consumers really quite aggressively towards these services, whilst also seeing the number of places selling CDs diminishing quite extraordinarily quickly, there are still a very small number of people in the world who have taken up this idea of music subscription,” says Lewis, contrasting the rate of streaming adoption with that from cassette to CD.    “The whole world moved from cassette to CD very quickly because you bought a CD player, you pressed play and off you went. It was so easy to adopt. I think [a fault of] myself and everyone else who was involved in the early days of streaming is that we failed to make it as fun, easy and simple as the old format changes,” he says.    To that end, Lewis hopes that Electric Jukebox will attract a mass market audience of casual music fans “who like to listen to music at home with the family and at social gatherings, but doesn’t have an affordable, fun and easy way to join this revolution.”   That’s despite it actually costing $50 more than a regular streaming subscription, which is usually not tethered to a TV set or the home, over a 12-month period (£169.00 compared to £119.00). If consumers continue subscribing to the service for a number of years, the price does incrementally fall below that of its competitors, but that’s a stout 'if.'   “We’re not targeting Spotify or Apple Music or Deezer consumers,” defends Lewis, citing independent research conducted by YouGov for Electric Jukebox that says only 8 percent of U.K. consumers currently subscribe to music streaming services. “We’re after the 92 percent of people who have been left out of streaming. Who play old CDs or listen to the radio and haven’t yet found a path to this wonderful idea of having access to all the music in the world.”    “We know that we’re taking on some of the goliaths - the Apples, the Amazons, etc. - and we have to be nimble and entrepreneurial in order to be able to achieve our goals,” he adds, citing a sustainable business model that, like the iPod and iPhone, draws revenue from the sale of hardware as well as subscriptions. That, says Lewis, has generated strong support from across the industry.    “What we have shown the music industry is that we can monetize a massive market of consumers who have failed to adopt to a new format. By bringing them into a world of streaming, we hope to make the music industry bigger.”   FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Comments Magazine Customer Service Subscribe Buy this issue Billboard biz The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.

Apple Releases iOS 10.2 Beta 2 to Public Testers, macOS 10.12.2 Beta 2 to Devs GO The new TV app on iOS 10.2 depends on Videos app Nov 8, 2016 22:00 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  We reported the other day that Apple started seeding the Beta 2 builds of the upcoming iOS 10.2, watchOS 3.1.1, and tvOS 10.1 operating systems to developers enrolled in the company's Apple Developer program. As expected, approximately 24 hours after registered developers were able to install the new Beta builds of iOS 10.2, tvOS 10.1 and watchOS 3.1.1 on their supported devices, now public beta testers can do that as well either by following our in-depth tutorial on how to install an iOS 10 Public Beta or by updating their existing Beta 1 installations. As mentioned in our initial report, the biggest new feature of the iOS 10.2 Public Beta 2 or Developer Beta 2 milestone is the addition of the new TV app that Apple unveiled last month during its "Hello Again" event where the Cupertino company announced new MacBook Pro models. The TV app will be installed automatically on your supported iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch device, along with the Videos app in case you removed it from your device. The TV app can also be removed if users choose to do so, especially considering that it cannot be used in countries where the iTunes Movies service is not supported. macOS 10.12.2 Sierra Beta 2 now available for developers Also today, Apple seeded the second Beta snapshot of the upcoming macOS 10.12.2 Sierra operating system for supported MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, MacBook, iMac, and Mac Mini devices, but only to registered developers. macOS Sierra 10.12.2 Beta 2 is tagged as build 16C41b, and is available via the Sierra Developer Beta Access Utility. Public beta testers will most probably be able to install the macOS 10.12.2 Sierra Beta 2 update as well in the coming hours, but rest assured that we will announce it right here on this space. In the meantime, Apple is yet to announced the second Beta release of its Xcode 8.2 IDE (Integrated Developer Environment) for developers. #iOS 10.2 Beta 2#macOS 10.12.2 Beta 2#macOS Sierra 10.12.2#Apple#TV app subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news iPhone Backups Are 1,000 Times Harder to Hack in iOS 10.2 Apple Seeds Second Beta of iOS 10.2, watchOS 3.1.1 & tvOS 10.1, Adds New TV App Apple Wants to Sell iPhones in India by Any Means No iPhone SE Refresh in 2017, Analyst Claims Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall Hackers Steal FIFA Currency, Buy Houses and Expensive Cars with the Money WhatsApp Announces Video Calling Rolling Out to Android, iOS Users Microsoft Announces Black Friday 2016 Deals: Perfect Time to Go Windows 10 KDE Frameworks 5.28.0 Released with Numerous KWayland Improvements, More NVIDIA Makes Available GeForce Graphics Driver 375.86 - Get It Now Microsoft CEO Meets Chinese Official One Day After Warning on Trump Tax Plan Apple Downplays Microsoft Surface, Says Having Touch on a Desktop Is a Disaster    iOS 10.2 Public Beta 2 released new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Donald Trump’s 45% Tariff on China Exports Could Backfire Against the iPhone more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

The latest round of funding for the Menlo Park, Calif., startup raises its market value to a staggering $1.55 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal, even before it has put a single vehicle on the road. Zoox, which is currently in "stealth" mode, reportedly to keep competitors from learning what it's doing, has attracted high-profile executives from Alphabet, Apple and Tesla Motors who joined the company to help develop its vehicle. Zoox In the Zoox ride-sharing service vehicle -- The Boz -- passengers would face each other. The company was founded by Australian animation designer Tim Kentley-Klay and Jesse Levinson, a Stanford University engineer working with the university's autonomous vehicle team. Levinson also worked with Sebastian Thrun, Alphabet's first self-driving car designer. Zoox initially stated its driverless cars would be manufactured for ride-hailing services like Uber, according to IEEE Spectrum. When the company was initially formed in 2013, it published computer renderings of its gullwing-door concept car "The Boz," a sports car that closely resembles video game vehicles from the movie Tron. "At Zoox what we're creating ... is not a self-driving car any more than the automobile is a horseless carriage. We're not building a robo-taxi service, we're actually creating an advanced mobility service," Kentley-Klay said at the White House Frontiers Conference in Pittsburgh last month, according to the WSJ. "You can really think of it as Disneyland on the streets of perhaps San Francisco, and that means a vehicle which is smart enough to understand its environment but it's also importantly smart enough to understand you, where you need to be, what you want to do in the vehicle and how you want to move around the city." IHS Automotive has predicted that by 2025 there will be 300,000 self-driving cars and just as many driverless vehicles on the road; by 2030, there will be 2.2 million self-driving and driverless cars on the road; and by 2035, there will be 11 million self-driving and 10 million driverless vehicles in operation. As the auto industry races toward shipping fully autonomous vehicles, self-driving technology startups have become attractive acquisition targets for traditional automakers and others. For example, General Motors earlier this year, acquired three-year-old Cruise Automation for its deep software talent and rapid development capability -- a move designed to further accelerate the automaker's development of autonomous vehicle technology. In July, ride-sharing service Uber acquired Otto, a maker of self-driving technology for delivery trucks. Ford Motor Co. plans to begin mass producing a fully autonomous vehicle by 2021 that it will sell for ride-hailing markets such as Uber. Ford's vehicle will be manufactured with no steering wheel, gas or brake pedal. In other words, a driver will not be required.

Resend activation e-mail Infinite Loop / The Apple Ecosystem The complete guide to living a newfangled USB-C (and Thunderbolt 3) lifestyle Finding good, safe cables and accessories takes more work than you'd think. by Andrew Cunningham - Nov 8, 2016 9:35 pm UTC Login to bookmark 202 Enlarge / You're going to need some help if you want to switch from the current array of ports to USB-C and Thunderbolt 3. Andrew Cunningham If you put in an order for a new MacBook Pro, welcome! You’re about to enter a brave new world, one where all your ports look the same as each other but remain totally different from every other port on whatever laptop you were using before. It’s not just the MacBook Pro making this transition. More and more laptops and phones are either including a USB Type-C port or switching to it entirely, and, going forward, this standard is going to get even harder to avoid. We’ve been big fans of the technology’s potential since before we even knew what it would look like. And while in practice it has created more than a little confusion, it should still be an improvement over the jumble of ports that we’ve had to live with previously. That said, the future looks brighter than the present, especially if you happen to have a phone or tablet or laptop that completely forgoes all other ports in favor of USB-C. Dongles, adapters, and new cables will easily be the norm for the next half-decade or so until everyone catches up, and it’s frustrating to have to dig through piles of Amazon listings to find stuff that will get the job done. The list below won't cover every possible use case for USB-C, but it should at a bare minimum help you replace all the ports on your old MacBook Pro. It represents an unexpectedly large amount of research and comparison shopping, not just for cables and adapters that will work with both USB-C PCs and Macs, but also cables and adapters that will do so without breaking your stuff or creating fire hazards. Table of Contents USB Type-A Micro USB Mini USB Lightning Video out: DisplayPort, HDMI, DVI, and VGA Gigabit Ethernet Thunderbolt and Thunderbolt 2 Card readers What if I just want USB-C or Thunderbolt 3 cables? How about flash drives? About USB-C and Thunderbolt docks USB Type-A Enlarge / Monoprice's four-port USB-C to USB-A hub. Monoprice Is there an official adapter? Yup. Apple sells a simple white USB-C to USB-A dongle for $19, and it will be $9 until the end of the year. The company’s VGA and HDMI display adapters also include a single Type-A port for convenience’s sake. What else is there? This is by far the most common type of adapter people are going to need, and lots and lots of companies have stepped up to answer the call. If all you want is a little one-port nub, there are plenty of no-name adapters you can grab on Amazon, and they’re often in a two-pack (handy for when you inevitably lose one). These from Rankie will run you $8 and they’re well-reviewed, and I use this one from Nonda because it’s aluminum and comes in different finishes that match the various MacBooks. If you want to turn one USB-C port into multiple USB-A ports, Monoprice sells a four-port USB 3.0 hub for $17 and a seven-port version of the same hub for $27. These are great for accessories like printers or webcams but less great for high-speed data transfers, since all of those ports are effectively arguing over the bandwidth provided by a single USB 3.0 port. These dongles also only provide USB Type-A; some hubs that we’ll recommend later can also do other things. Micro USB Enlarge / Cable Matters' USB-C to micro USB cable. Amazon The standard USB Type-A connector is the most common one on the host end, but the thing you’re plugging in will often use micro or mini USB (these are technically all part of the Type-B family of connectors, as is the larger one used for USB printers). Micro USB is the smaller of the two, and it’s nearly omnipresent in everything from Kindles to high-end cameras to smart home accessories to older and lower-end Android phones. You can use one of the USB-A dongles above with your current cables, but here are some other options. Is there an official cable? Not really; Apple virtually never used micro or mini USB (the service port on older Apple TVs is the only example I can think of). Apple will sell you Belkin’s version of the cable for a hefty $20 or $14 with the discount—it’s very Apple-like in aesthetics and in price. What else is there? This $7 3-foot cable from Cable Matters has USB-C on one end and micro USB on the other; a longer 6-foot cable costs $8. Reviews and the manufacturer’s product page indicate that this cable supports faster 5V/3A charging speeds, something that some other cables don’t do. If you don’t care about those faster charging speeds, Monoprice offers a similar cable in a variety of lengths and colors for a little less money. Monoprice also sells 3- and 6-foot USB-C cables that have the ugly, bulky “Micro-USB 3.0” connector on the other end. This connector cropped up in some slim external hard drives and very occasionally in phones. If, for whatever reason, you need to convert the other way—if you want to take a micro USB cable and plug it into a USB-C port—Anker sells a two-pack for $8. These have been verified as spec-compliant by Google engineer and USB-C cable testing vigilante Benson Leung. Mini USB Enlarge / A mini USB to USB-C cable. Monoprice It has become rare these days, but you’ll still sometimes run into the larger mini USB connector in DSLRs, external drives, and other accessories. Is there an official cable? No, and there’s not an Apple-blessed version of the cable in its online store either. What else is there? The same Cable Matters micro USB cable we recommended above comes in a mini USB version; right now both the 3- and 6-foot versions will run you $8. Monoprice has a 1.5-foot version for $4.49. Lightning Enlarge / Apple's Lightning to USB-C cable is the only one you should buy, for now. Apple The brewing civil war between USB-C and Lightning is probably the most frustrating thing about Apple’s hardware ecosystem right now. Buy a brand-new iPhone 7 and a brand-new MacBook Pro today, and without an adapter or separate cable you won’t have any way to connect them to each other. The latest versions of all of Apple’s external mice, trackpads, and keyboards all charge via Lightning, too. Is there an official cable? Yes. Apple sells both 1m and 2m versions of the Lightning to USB-C cable for $25 and $35 respectively, or $19 and $29 with the discount. This is expensive, but Apple gave me one of these with our MacBook Pro review unit, and the good news is that these cables are much thicker and sturdier than the USB-A to Lightning cables that come with iPhones, iPads, and other peripherals. They should be less prone to fraying than the old cables, and hopefully once Apple starts including USB-C to Lightning cables in the box with iPhones and iPads they’ll feel similarly sturdy. What else is there? Again, there are lots of small- and no-name companies out there rushing to capitalize on this brand-new market that Apple has created, and Amazon is flooded with options of questionable quality. Fortunately, we have an easy litmus test to tell probably fine cables from possibly not fine ones, and that’s Apple’s MFi certification program. As of this writing, none of the USB-C to Lightning cables listed on Amazon appear to be MFi-certified, and relatively reliable and respectable companies like Anker, Monoprice, and AmazonBasics don’t offer them either. Not only does this mean that the cables may not comply with Apple’s specs, but your phone or tablet may yell at you for using non-compliant accessories. Honestly, you probably already have a bunch of Lightning cables sitting around—your best move in this case is to continue using those cables with a USB-A to USB-C adapter when you need to plug one into your MacBook or MacBook Pro. It’s annoying, but if you don’t want to pay Apple’s prices, it’s the safest possible option right now. You don’t want to mess around when you buy cables or adapters that you rely on for charging, and I can’t stress this enough—bad ones can damage your devices and be serious fire hazards. Video out: DisplayPort, HDMI, DVI, and VGA Enlarge / It ain't pretty, but this VGA and HDMI dongle will connect your stuff to most monitors. Amazon Are there official adapters? Yes. Apple provides separate HDMI and VGA dongles for $69 each, or $49 with the current discounts. These also include a single USB-A port and another USB-C port that can be used for charging—not something you’ll necessarily need for the MacBook Pros, but handy for the one-ported MacBook. Just note that none of these laptops will be able to drive a 4K display at 60Hz over HDMI. You’ll still need to use DisplayPort for that. What else is there? Let’s start with DisplayPort, since those ports are still the only way to do 60Hz 4K. Cable Matters sells a $29 cable that will run directly from a DisplayPort-enabled USB-C port to a monitor, taking advantage of USB Alternate Mode to carry a native DisplayPort signal over the cable. Google will sell you one for $40 that works just fine with Apple’s stuff, if you’d be more comfortable with a bigger brand name. If you’d rather use an adapter for an existing DisplayPort cable, Cable Matters will sell you one of those for $20. Things get trickier if you’re looking for something to go from your USB-C port to a Mini DisplayPort adapter or cable. Amazon reviews for the products that do crop up are mostly mixed to nonexistent. Odds are your monitor uses a full-size DisplayPort for input rather than mini DisplayPort, so if that’s the case we’d recommend you just replace your cables rather than messing with mini DisplayPort adapters for your current cables. As for VGA and HDMI, Cable Matters will sell you an ugly-ish but well-reviewed and functional dongle that provides both of those connectors plus USB-A and gigabit Ethernet (the Ethernet will work fine without extra drivers in Windows but “may” need drivers under macOS, which is common with USB Ethernet dongles). Aukey has a standalone VGA dongle for $16 and a standalone HDMI dongle for $20. And while USB-C to DVI connectors are less common than the others, CableCreation has one available for $19 (its VGA and HDMI adapters are also $16 and $17, respectively, they just don’t look quite as Apple-y as the Aukey versions).

Comments By Lucas Mearian Follow Computerworld | Nov 8, 2016 1:21 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Car Tech Emerging Technology Computer Hardware Comments Zoox Labs, a two-year-old Silicon Valley company that like Alphabet and Apple is developing a self-driving car from the ground up, has scored another $50 million in funding, bringing its total to $240 million, according to published reports. The latest round of funding for the Menlo Park, Calif., startup raises its market value to a staggering $1.55 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal, even before it has put a single vehicle on the road. Zoox, which is currently in "stealth" mode, reportedly to keep competitors from learning what it's doing, has attracted high-profile executives from Alphabet, Apple and Tesla Motors who joined the company to help develop its vehicle. Zoox In the Zoox ride-sharing service vehicle -- The Boz -- passengers would face each other. The company was founded by Australian animation designer Tim Kentley-Klay and Jesse Levinson, a Stanford University engineer working with the university's autonomous vehicle team. Levinson also worked with Sebastian Thrun, Alphabet's first self-driving car designer. Zoox initially stated its driverless cars would be manufactured for ride-hailing services like Uber, according to IEEE Spectrum. When the company was initially formed in 2013, it published computer renderings of its gullwing-door concept car "The Boz," a sports car that closely resembles video game vehicles from the movie Tron. "At Zoox what we're creating ... is not a self-driving car any more than the automobile is a horseless carriage. We're not building a robo-taxi service, we're actually creating an advanced mobility service," Kentley-Klay said at the White House Frontiers Conference in Pittsburgh last month, according to the WSJ. "You can really think of it as Disneyland on the streets of perhaps San Francisco, and that means a vehicle which is smart enough to understand its environment but it's also importantly smart enough to understand you, where you need to be, what you want to do in the vehicle and how you want to move around the city." IHS Automotive has predicted that by 2025 there will be 300,000 self-driving cars and just as many driverless vehicles on the road; by 2030, there will be 2.2 million self-driving and driverless cars on the road; and by 2035, there will be 11 million self-driving and 10 million driverless vehicles in operation. As the auto industry races toward shipping fully autonomous vehicles, self-driving technology startups have become attractive acquisition targets for traditional automakers and others. For example, General Motors earlier this year, acquired three-year-old Cruise Automation for its deep software talent and rapid development capability -- a move designed to further accelerate the automaker's development of autonomous vehicle technology. In July, ride-sharing service Uber acquired Otto, a maker of self-driving technology for delivery trucks. Ford Motor Co. plans to begin mass producing a fully autonomous vehicle by 2021 that it will sell for ride-hailing markets such as Uber. Ford's vehicle will be manufactured with no steering wheel, gas or brake pedal. In other words, a driver will not be required.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Apple starts selling refurbished iPhones for the first time, iPhone 6s starts at $449 Apple has long offered certified refurbished iPads, iPods, and Macs on its online store, but this is the first time that the Cupertino giant has put up refurbished iPhones on sale.  As first spotted by MacRumors, Apple has updated its online refurbished store (‘Refurbished and Clearance’ section on apple.com) to include certified refurbished iPhones. The company is only selling Unlocked SIM-Free iPhone 6s models for now. These come at a relatively lower price from Apple with full one-year warranty in the United States. Consumers will save $100 on the base 16GB iPhone 6s, although the new iPhone 6s base model now comes with 32GB storage for $549. As of now, Apple is offering different colour options, but only in 16GB and 64GB storage variants. The 16GB iPhone 6s starts at $449, while the 16GB iPhone 6s Plus is priced at $529. Meanwhile in another news, Apple might introduce a ‘Jet White’ variant for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models, as reported by a Japanese blog Mac Otakara. While it doesn’t mention when Apple can add the new variant to the existing lineup and also the source doesn’t seem reliable, so you should take it with a pinch of salt.

By Jason Cipriani | November 8, 2016 -- 20:45 GMT (12:45 PST) | Topic: Apple If you've recently broken your iPhone and don't have insurance or AppleCare, you can save yourself some money and purchase a refurbished iPhone directly from Apple. As MacRumors reported, Apple recently added iPhones to its refurbished storefront for the first time. In the past, Apple has used the same website to sell refurbished Macs, iPads, iPods, Apple TVs, and accessories. The listings are currently limited to 16GB or 64GB iPhone 6S models, all of which are unlocked and will work on nearly any wireless carrier. review Apple iPhone 6s: More than just a speed-bump The iPhone 6s provides major improvements over the iPhone 6 in terms of performance, camera quality and the new 3D Touch technology. Read More When purchasing a refurbished device instead of a new one, your overall savings depend on the model and storage. Apple no longer sells a 16GB or 64GB model of either size iPhone 6S, making it tough to do direct price comparisons. However, you most certainly will save money by going the refurbished route if a 64GB phone will work for you. For example, you can buy a refurbished iPhone 6S Plus with 64GB of storage for $589, or a new iPhone 6S Plus with 32GB of storage for $649. One of the biggest advantages of buying a refurbished phone from Apple is the fact the company thoroughly tests each device and guarantees it with a full one-year warranty from the date you purchase it. Apple also replaces all outer shells and batteries on refurbished devices, which makes the device feel and function like a new phone would. Purchasing a refurbished device from Apple may still be more expensive than buying a used phone off Craigslist or eBay, but at least you have the peace of mind in knowing it has been checked, repaired, and certified by Apple.

Technology 1 0 0 November 8, 2016 MacBook Pro 2016 Shipping: November 11 Soonest ETA For Earliest Buyers? Venus Montalbo The initial batch of MacBook Pro 2016 units is most likely already shipping, with reports that November 11 could be the earliest possible date of arrival of these new Apple laptops to customers. If you pre-order the MacBook Pro 2016 model with Apple Retina Touch Bar display and your credit card was recently charged by Apple, it could mean that the order is now being processed and shipping of the unit is already on the horizon. [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] As Apple prepares for the first batch of shipments of the MacBook Pro 2016 (both the 13-inch and 15-inch models with Touch Bar), earliest customers can expect to receive it this week, specifically starting Friday, according to reports. Those who ordered the new laptop model on the day of Apple’s “Hello Again” launch event (October 27) or a day after were the ones who reportedly received credit card charges on Monday. “Delivery dates for the first batch of shipments generally fall between Nov. 11 and Nov. 17, with some of the first wave reporting a date range ending as late as Nov. 25,” AppleInsider further explained. This week is the shipping date for those who ordered the new MacBook Pro under original 2-3 weeks. I've to wait a month #TouchBarIsComing — Alejo MirandadeLarra (@AlejoMiranda) November 7, 2016 Looks like Apple has started charging cards for the new MacBook Pro line. Hopefully we will start seeing shipping movement this week. — Mark Dalton (@TheMarkDalton) November 7, 2016 My order of the new MacBook Pro is processing. Hopefully shipping shortly. — Aaron Zollo (@Zollotech) November 7, 2016 Website 9to5Mac confirmed reports about the imminent shipping of the new MacBook Pros explaining at the Cupertino-based tech giant usually starts delivering orders soon after charging their customer’s credit cards. However, it seems like the order status has not been changed yet to give an expected delivery day. “Apple usually changes orders from ‘Processing’ to ‘Shipped’ after charging cards, at which time customers should have a more accurate estimated delivery date provided compared to Apple’s original estimated week-long window,” the site noted. More on the expected shipping schedule for the MacBook Pro 2016, it seems like those who ordered the Touch Bar-enabled laptop late will get earlier shipment timeframe. From their original expected delivery time, which is at the end of December, the shipping schedule showing up as of the moment is early or mid-December. [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] The Macbook Pro 2016 is Apple’s refreshed version of its flagship laptop line and one of its significant highlights is the Touch Bar, which is featured on both the 13-inch and 15-inch models. It is a second Retina display located above the upper part of the keyboard, replacing the Fn keys. The power button with Touch ID is also incorporated in this new feature. Pocket-Lint further described Macbook Pro 2016’s Retina Touch Bar display. “This OLED panel supports up to 10-points of touch and is full colour, designed to change its options depending on what you’re doing on your Mac. It will offer things like volume sliders, shortcuts in your browser, text predictions when typing and tools when using more advanced programs.” Although the new MacBook Pro comes with this new cool feature, Apple received a backlash from its followers mostly because of the massive price hike of the devices compared to previous models and for the huge price difference of the Touch Bar-free and Touch Bar-equipped model. The 13-inch Macbook Pro without the Touch Bar is available for $1,499, while the model with this feature is $300 more expensive. Meanwhile, those who wish to get the 15-inch MacBook Pro will have to shell out $2,399 Just ordered the new @apple MacBook Pro.

But we don’t design for price, we design for the experience and the quality people expect from Mac. Sometimes that means we end up at the higher end of the range, but not on purpose, just because that’s what it costs.” If you’re planning to buy the MacBook Pro, its expected availability in Apple stores starts around November 15.

Apple mixed reality ambitions could result in... a revolutionary TV? by Chris Smith 08 November 2016 0 shares Read Comments Apple is working on a new television set that will incorporate ‘mixed reality technology’ according to noted tech evangelist Robert Scoble. Speaking at the Web Summit in Lisbon (via Wareable), Scoble said the new TV set has been in the works since the time of Steve Jobs and will be revealed within a year. He said Apple has a whopping 600 engineers on the project, with the whole deal based around the tech from the PrimeSense start-up it bought way back in 2013. He said: “Tim Cook and Steve Jobs, I believe, sat down and talked about the future of TV and in 11 months they are going to show you the future of TV – because they are building the PrimeSense sensor right into the television, into the iPad and into the iPhone… so you can do this kind of mixed reality. "Apple has 600 engineers working on it. There was a patent released this morning – they've been working on mixed reality, or augmented reality, for five years… minimum.” Related: Apple TV review You may remember PrimeSense as the company that helped Microsoft create the criminally-undervalued Kinect Sensor. Scobel claimed whatever Apple unveils by October next year will “blow even his mind.” The patent he refers to involves an AR mapping system for iPhone, which will offer real time augmented views of a real-life environment. Where this would all tie in with a television set Apple is thought to have abandoned long ago remains to be seen. Does this all seem a little far-fetched to you too?

joshua stein about | projects | rss | e-mail | github | twitter The 2016 MacBook Pro posted to this is not a weblog on nov 8th, 2016 with tags apple, mac, and nerd I've been using an 11" MacBook Air as my primary computer for six years. It's a great computer that satisfied a lot of requirements I had for a laptop: thin, lightweight, small form factor, excellent keyboard and touchpad, mostly silent, but not an Atom or Core M processor. I've done a lot on this little computer, like compiling and maintaining an Android ROM, writing the Rails, iOS, and Android apps for Pushover, creating Lobsters, recording and editing 40 episodes of Garbage, and lots of OpenBSD development. The current model I have is a Mid-2013 MacBook Air with a 1.3Ghz Core i5 with 4Gb of RAM and a 256Gb SSD. These are not terrible specs (unless you are one of those complaining that the new MacBook Pro doesn't have 32Gb of RAM to run your text editor written in JavaScript) but I've recently been bumping up against its limits. I would run out of disk space while editing large podcast episodes in Audacity, and the 1366x768 non-Retina screen has started to feel a bit cramped in Xcode. Certainly using the HiDPI screens on my Samsung ATIV Book 9 and Chromebook Pixel have ruined me for non-HiDPI screens. Compromises When the 12" Retina MacBook came out, I bought it hoping to retain the form factor of my Air and get a larger and higher resolution display. Unfortunately, I returned it after a short while because I disliked the keyboard so much. The key travel was so shallow and would bottom out with much of my key presses, causing pain in my fingers. The basic premise of the 12" MacBook felt like a big compromise: if you were willing to put up with the lack of ports and an uncomfortable keyboard, you could get something very small and lightweight in return. I'm no stranger to such compromises, but this was not one I was willing to make for my primary workstation. As WWDC 2016 came and went with no mention of updated Macs, I anxiously awaited the next Apple event to see what would replace my Air. When the first photos of the new MacBook Pro "leaked", I was disappointed to see that it had adopted the terrible keyboard from the MacBook and replaced the physical Escape key with the TouchBar. As the Air has typically been the cheaper Mac laptop, both in cost and in materials like its screen, I watched the October Keynote hoping the TouchBar and keyboard mess would be confined to the Pro while leaving the Air to "just" a spec bump and a Retina screen. The demos of the Touch Bar made it seem completely impractical for doing anything more than adjusting screen brightness or volume. You can see it in this woman's posture, how awkward she looks hunched over trying to peck at the tiny screen under her finger. And the thought of a DJ actually using that tiny bar to produce music instead of a physical drum machine had me laughing. The Touch Bar seems like a poor solution for problems no one had.   As the Keynote dragged on, I learned my 11" Air not only didn't get a Retina update, but had been completely discontinued. The 13" Air didn't get an update but will probably be discontinued soon as well. While there was good news in that the new 13" MacBook Pro would be available with physical function and Escape keys, it would be considered a low-end model with weaker specs and only 2 Thunderbolt/USB-C ports. Since it was clear my upgrade path had just narrowed to basically one machine, I ordered the "low-end" model with physical function keys, 16Gb of RAM, and a 512Gb SSD for $2,044 (with a USB-C Lightning cable, of course, so I could actually do iOS development with it). New Compromises I used the new MacBook Pro for a couple days, and just like the 12" MacBook, I ended up returning it. Its keyboard, while better than the 12" MacBook, still represents a compromise that I'm not willing to make. I am not cobbling together e-mail replies at a coffee shop. I am a professional software developer and my job requires tons of typing every day. My development environment is completely keyboard-driven, my text editor is completely keyboard-driven, and all of the work I do on remote servers is entirely keyboard-driven. I need my keyboard to work reliably, I need to be able to make keystrokes (which include arrow keys, key modifiers, Escape, etc.) accurately, and I want the keyboard to just work without thinking about it or having to change my typing habits depending on which computer I'm on. The 2016 MacBook Pro's keyboard does none of that for me. The keys have very low travel, which results in a hollow, unreassuring feedback when typing. Since its keys are very close together and also very short, it can be hard to find accessory keys (like the arrows or backspace) quickly by feel. 2015 MacBook Pro 2016 MacBook Pro Aside from the keyboard, the 2016 MacBook Pro also introduces a number of other compromises. The magnetic MagSafe power connector is gone, replaced by an all-purpose Thunderbolt/USB-C port. I'm no stranger to USB-C, having a 2015 Chromebook Pixel that can charge via USB-C, but I'd still take the proprietary MagSafe over a standard USB-C charger any day. Losing MagSafe also takes with it the LED on its connector, which lets you know when the laptop has finished charging without having to power it up or unlock it. The new USB-C power brick that comes with the 2016 MacBook Pro also loses the little wings on it which serve to wrap the rest of the cord neatly. Much has been said elsewhere about all of the dongles required with the new MacBook Pro since it only has 2 (or 4 on the TouchBar model) USB-C ports with nothing else. No more DisplayPort, HDMI, USB-A, or SD card slot. This doesn't bother me too much since I rarely use any of those ports when I'm not at my desk, but I don't understand why Apple wouldn't include at least one USB-A port on this first model year of the transition. Some tried to reason that if Apple included that legacy port, customers would never transition to USB-C, which just seems silly to me. My Chromebook Pixel from 2015 has two USB-A and two USB-C connectors, and I use them both and have accessories for both types. Conveniently, my Pixel has a USB-C port on both sides, allowing it to be charged from either port depending on where the laptop is sitting in relation to the wall wart. On the 2016 MacBook Pro, the "low-end" model that I got has both of its USB-C ports on the left side with nothing but a headphone jack on the right side (which also lost its optical output). If I have to lose MagSafe, at least give me the convenience of being able to charge on both sides. So now the iPhone 7 has no headphone port and only a Lightning port, and this MacBook Pro which came out after it has a headphone port and no Lightning port. Connecting an iPhone to the new MacBook Pro (which is required for anyone doing iOS development) requires a new cable since the one included with iPhones is USB-A. What a mess. While Apple did eventually lower the price of its adapters after so many people complained, they could have just included a few basic ones (like USB-A to USB-C) in the box especially given its high price. It's pretty standard for PC manufacturers to include adapters with them when they have non-standard ports for things like video out and Ethernet. Remember when the iPhone actually came with a dock in the box? Apple finally removed the startup chime (something I've had to do with 3rd party software for years), and made it automatically power on when the lid is opened, like Chromebooks do. I welcome both of those changes. The new Retina display is brighter than the previous one, and certainly a welcome upgrade from the 1366x768 display on my Air. I didn't get a model with the Touch Bar, but I predict it ends up being just like Force Touch, or 3D Touch on the iPhone. It's an extra feature that developers can write clever functionality for, but because not all users will have the hardware available (or they won't want to use it), developers can't rely on it being used for any critical or even routine functionality in an application. There will always have to be an additional way of triggering that functionality on hardware that doesn't have Force/3D Touch (or now the Touch Bar), so aside from showing it off in some demo videos, it won't get widely used. Once the novelty wears off, users will go back to using the keyboard and touchpad because so many other things will still need to be done through them. The Touch ID sensor addition is nice, though I don't think I'd use it much since I would prefer to keep my Mac locked by a passphrase. If you see photos of the Touch Bar in use, you'll note that the software Escape key shown on the Touch Bar is always offset to the right quite a bit. This is because the Touch Bar's display doesn't actually extend all the way to the right because of the Touch ID sensor, and so for for symmetry, Apple made it not extend all the way to the left either. But rather than just leave that blank space on the Touch Bar, why couldn't Apple have put a physical key there the same width as the Touch ID? You know, like the Escape key, right where the Escape key was before. Too Many Compromises My main gripe with the 2016 MacBook Pro is that so many of these compromises were just unnecessary. The 13" MacBook Air is, as close as makes no difference, the same thickness as the new MacBook Pro, yet the Air has a full-depth keyboard. The butterfly keyboard on the 12" MacBook and now the Pro were created just to solve the problem of how to fit more stuff underneath it in a thinner laptop. It was not created as a superior keyboard, yet it found its way to the MacBook Pro just because it let Apple shave a few millimeters off its height. The touchpad is now comically large and gets touched more while typing. Was anyone complaining that the touchpad wasn't large enough before? The "low-end" Pro only has two Thunderbolt/USB-C ports while they were able to fit four in the same exact enclosure on the "high-end" version, implying that this was purely a cost-saving measure (on a laptop that still costs $2,000). So with all of that said, I was still in the position of needing a new Mac after returning my 2016 MacBook Pro. (For anyone about to say that I should have ditched Apple and got a better laptop from a different vendor: I make my living developing a product that has an iOS app, so I am tied to the Mac platform for much of my work.) A quick comparison between the 2016 MacBook Pro and its predecessor showed that the specs were not appreciably different in terms of performance, storage, RAM, screen resolution, etc. and I would still retain the great keyboard, MagSafe, and accessory ports. 2013 MacBook Air 11", 2015 MacBook Pro 13", 2016 MacBook Pro 13" So with that, I bought an Early-2015 13" MacBook Pro with a 2.9Ghz Core i5, 16Gb of RAM, and a 512Gb SSD, on which I am now happily typing. I'm not terribly happy at having to buy a one-and-a-half year old computer, or having to pay the same price as the 2016 model with the same performance, or knowing that I could have bought this same exact computer a year and a half ago when it came out instead of having to wait all this time with my 11" Air. But at least I'm happy to type on it.

Apple is sharply reducing the prices of its USB-C adapters for its new MacBook Pro laptops after hearing loud complaints from many users about the cost and need for the dongles that will let them use their new machines with legacy peripherals that they already own. In an emailed statement sent to eWEEK on Nov. 7, Apple said it announced the USB-C adapter price cuts that will be good through the end of 2016 to address the concerns of the company's customers. Under the new pricing plan, all Apple-branded USB-C to USB adapters will be $9 instead of $19; while Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapters will sell for $29, instead of $49. USB-C to Lightning cables will be $19 instead of $25 for the 1-meter version, while the 2-meter version will be $29 instead of $35. In addition, the Apple USB-C Digital AV Multiport adapter will be $49 instead of $69. Some 85 percent of Samsung's troubled Galaxy Note7 smartphones have been returned since a massive recall in September and October due to battery fires and explosions. But the company is still working to encourage owners to return the remaining phones as soon as possible. To hasten Note7 returns, Samsung is releasing a software update that will cut the available charging capacity of the recalled handsets to 60 percent so they will have shorter battery lives, the company announced in a Nov. 4 statement. "As of today, nearly 85 percent of all recalled Galaxy Note7 devices have been replaced through the U.S. Note7 Refund and Exchange Program, with the majority of the participants opting to receive another Samsung smartphone," the company said in the statement. Oracle is finally getting its hands on NetSuite, a provider of cloud enterprise resource planning applications. The move is designed to bolster the growth of Oracle's cloud software-as-as-service business and give it greater access to the important midmarket space. Oracle officials said in a statement early Nov. 5 that enough shares of NetSuite had been tendered to enable Oracle to move forward with the $9.3 billion acquisition, adding that the deal will close Nov. 7. The announcement of the deal this weekend came as the Nov. 4 stock tender deadline that Oracle had set was passing. Soon, smaller companies won't have to pay extra for its Access database management application. Microsoft said it's bundling the Access database with its Office 365 plans for small and midsize businesses. Next month, Microsoft will be rolling out Access, which is presently included with Office 365 ProPlus, E3 and E5 plans, to Business and Business Premium subscribers as part of a client software update. The company plans to dole out automatic installations to customers over a two-month period from Dec. 1 through Jan. 30, 2017.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

According to AppleInsider, a few customers who were early purchasers of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar have begun seeing that Apple has now charged their credit cards. This is a sign that a new MacBook Pro may soon be showing up on their doorstep. “Multiple reports collated by AppleInsider and other sources show that Apple is gearing up for the first wave of shipments of the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, in every configuration. The credit card charges being made on Monday seem limited to those who ordered machines on the day of or the day after the Oct. 27 “Hello Again” press event.” #MacBook #Apple – MacBook Pro with Touch Bar shipping status : For those of you that are constantly checking your… https://t.co/oKZU6AHMGg pic.twitter.com/SkEX2PcOaY — Tech Science & Money (@www_appsnews) November 8, 2016 More information on MacBook Pro 2016 shipping was made available by Jordan Kahn of 9to5Mac. According to that report, Apple customers usually receive their products a short time after their credit cards are charged, but as of Monday, orders had not been updated to show an expected delivery date. “Apple typically begins shipping devices shortly after charging credit cards, but so far it appears to have not yet changed the status of orders to provide an expected delivery day. Apple usually changes orders from ‘Processing’ to ‘Shipped’ after charging cards, at which time customers should have a more accurate estimated delivery date provided compared to Apple’s original estimated week-long window.” MacBook Pro 2016 shipping for the Touch Bar model may be just around the corner. AppleInsider reports that the first wave of customers typically receives their shipments between November 11 and November 18, with the wait lasting until November 25 at the absolute latest. AppleInsider also states that customers who ordered their MacBook Pro a little bit later (those who ordered two or more days after the Hello Again event) do not appear to have had their credit cards charged. However, some have seen their expected delivery dates move up from the end of December to mid-December, meaning it could still arrive in time for the holiday season for some who may have purchased it as a gift. For in-store purchases, baseline models are reportedly expected to be available around November 15, but it will be a longer wait for the more advanced models. The news of MacBook Pro 2016 shipping should be a big source of excitement for those who have been excited about the product since it was first announced. When the newest version was first unveiled, Apple marketed it as “the thinnest and lightest” MacBook Pro to date. The 13-inch model was reported to be 17 percent thinner than the last model, and the 15-inch model was said to be 14 percent thinner. Many other exciting features were revealed as well. The biggest element that stands out about the new MacBook Pro is the revolutionary Touch Bar feature. AppleInsider describes the Touch Bar as being “application specific,” giving users “dynamic buttons and input options” and providing fast entry to popular tools. The new model will also feature a Touch ID fingerprint, which enables a user to log into their device or even make payments with only his or her fingerprint. Meet the MacBook Pro’s new Touch Bar with TouchID https://t.co/cCzisxHaBQ pic.twitter.com/qX3A3mJULR — Engadget (@engadget) October 30, 2016 Updates regarding MacBook Pro 2016 shipping and the volume and frequency at which they are going out should continue to be in the news as well. DigiTimes recently reported on how the demand for the product is expected to be strong, and there are market watchers who expect shipments to surpass 15 million units this year alone. “Thanks to the recent rising MacBook Pro shipments, some market watchers expect Apple’s MacBook shipments to reach 15 million units in 2016, with shipments staying at that level in 2017.” The MacBook Pro 2016 with Touch Bar is also very expensive, with prices ranging from $1,789 to over $4,000. But if it is in your price range and you have already made a purchase of this new, state-of-the-art product, it may be time to look for an update. Your MacBook Pro 2016 shipping status could change very soon, especially if you were an early buyer.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Nov 8, 2016 at 2:32PM Services have become an incredibly important part of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) business, which now brings in more revenue than either the Mac or the iPad. Meanwhile, Apple's guidance left a little to be desired. In this clip from Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and Evan Niu, CFA, break down the results from the latest earnings release. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 28, 2016. Dylan Lewis: One of the things I thought was particularly interesting with the commentary from this report was, you look at the services segment, you look at the last couple quarters, you've seen service segment revenue up 20%, and they're really touting this number. Most recently, it was $6.3 billion, which is roughly 13% of revenue. At this point, we're coming up on two full years of them breaking out services as a product segment. Looking backwards, we've seen a huge step change in the fiscal Q1 quarter. In 2015 fiscal Q4, we were at $5.1 billion. That hopped up a full billion dollars in the following quarter, fiscal Q1 2016. So, I'm really curious looking forward what that segment might look like. Theoretically, we should be in the step-change quarter. It'll be interesting to see if they can sustain that growth, or if we're going to continue to see them hum along at more or less flat sequential growth. Evan Niu: Yeah, services is becoming huge. Like you said, it's $6.3 billion. And if you look at the past four quarters, this is now basically a $25 billion business. That's bigger than the Mac, bigger than the iPad. It's their second-biggest business at this point, which is kind of crazy to think about, because Apple is typically not that great at services in general. Particularly because the services revenue, most of it is not coming from a subscription service like Apple Music that bills every month. That's certainly part of it. But it comes back to what we were talking about earlier, which is the whole installed base-related purchases. A lot of that services revenue comes from them relying on their users buying content and apps on the App Store reliably. That's why that number is important, and I'm surprised they didn't give it. Not a whole lot of it is occurring, monthly subscription fees that you can count on every month. So, it is important, but they're doing a really good job of growing that number. It's a pretty big business now, $25 billion. Lewis: It's huge. I think, you hit on the installed base thing, if there are any issues with them growing that installed base, it stands to reason that the services segment won't continue to grow the way that it has. That's kind of the relationship there, and that's why you always see the step change happen in fiscal Q1, because that's when they sell a ton of iPhones. You're going to see those two things move together. That's certainly something that I'm watching in the coming quarter, because they're pointing to it more and more in their conference calls. I think it's an indication of a lot of other elements of their business. Niu: Absolutely. Lewis: Looking forward and looking at the guidance that they provided, for the first time since physical Q1 of last year, Apple is guiding for year-over-year growth next quarter, which I think is a welcome sign for a lot of investors. The company is expecting revenue to come in somewhere between $76 billion and $78 billion. When we say year-over-year growth, fiscal Q1 last year, they posted revenue of $75.8 billion. So, it's not going to be huge, but it is positive growth. Niu: I'll take it.  Lewis: Yeah, at this point, looking year-over-year declines for a little while, it's certainly a welcome trend to see. I think some people are maybe a little disappointed in this guidance, given some of the tailwinds that the business has right now at its disposal. This is something we've talked about in previous shows. One of the major competitors, the Samsung Note 7, being off the market, you would think would be a much larger catalyst for Apple than maybe they're letting on. Niu: Yeah. They declined to give any meaningful comment on whether or not they think they'll benefit, but I think pretty clearly that they will. And now there's even reports that the Galaxy S7 Edge is catching on fire. I don't know if you've seen it, there's not as many of them. But there were reports starting in September. That was a month ago. Again, it's not as widespread, but there are a handful of cases across the world, like in China and the Philippines with the S7 Edge -- which is one of the phones that Samsung is pushing people toward. And here's the crazy part -- one of those phone was a replacement for a Galaxy Note 7. So Samsung gives a customer an S7 Edge to replace his Note 7 that caught on fire, and the S7 Edge catches on fire! It's just a mess. Lewis: That's a bad brand experience there. Niu: I think, going back to their guidance, I do think, the one thing that stood out to me as far as not so great in the guidance was the gross margin guide. The revenue guidance was fine because it'll be nice to get a little growth, even if it's not a lot. We had three consecutive quarters of negative growth up top at this point, so I think anything is nice. On the profitability side, I was surprised, too, because in the fourth quarter, Apple always enjoys a lot of operating leverage when their revenue scales up to these really high levels. Usually, you see margins expanding in a pretty meaningful way, usually to the point where you're at 40%. They're guiding to basically upwards of 38.5%. So, 50 basis points shy of what I would expect them to guide to. And, for what it's worth, last year they did 40%. Lewis: In fairness on that 40% figure, that was also a quarter where they realized $550 million or so in a patent dispute agreement with Samsung. I think that added about 40 basis points to that margin number. I think the true margin number was like 39.6% or so. Niu: But if you go back another year, it was still like 39.9%. It's still pretty close to 40%. And I know it doesn't sound like a lot, 50 basis points, but when you're talking about a business this big, every basis point counts. One basis point is like $7.6 million. So, multiply that by 50, and that's gross profit, coming straight down through the income statement. They've been talking a lot about commodity costs and component costs being very favorable. So, I'm wondering why that guidance wasn't stronger. It's also possible that there are some currency effects, because they've been battling the strengthening dollar for a really long time. That's very much hurting them, because about two-thirds of revenue comes from outside the U.S. The strengthening dollar has been hurting them for many quarters. So, that could also be part of it. I think that might have been why the original market reaction was negative. If you're watching after hours, the stock jumped on the iPhone number as soon as it was released, started getting back those gains as people read through the numbers and started digesting them a little bit.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 8, 2016 at 3:16PM Highly respected microprocessor analyst David Kanter recently posted an article on his website, Real World Tech, detailing an interesting discovery. He says Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has finally managed to design its own graphics processing unit (GPU) for integration into its A-series chips used inside both its iPhone and iPad series of products. Image source: Apple.  Perhaps more surprisingly, Kanter says that Apple launched its first custom graphics processor design inside the A8 chip that powered the iPhone 6-series smartphones. The company has presumably iterated upon that original design with the graphics processors found inside Apple's A9 and A10 Fusion chips released in subsequent years. Before building its own graphics processor, Apple relied on designs produced by graphics specialist and longtime Apple supplier Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF). Let's take a closer look at what Apple's custom graphics processor means for Imagination Technologies, if anything. Imagination Technologies still in the loop Kanter begins with an explanation of the three major components of a typical GPU: A modern GPU, like the ones inside Apple's iPhone and iPad, has three major components that must all work together in harmony to render a scene. The first is the fixed-function graphics hardware, which is responsible for tasks like processing API commands, triangle rasterization, and raster output. The second is the shader core, which is the heart of the GPU and executes programmable shaders (e.g., vertex, geometry, pixel, and compute shaders). Last, the graphics driver is the software that runs on the CPU and ties everything together, coordinating the activities of the GPU. According to Kanter, although much of Apple's graphics processor design is custom, there's still quite a bit of technology inside the design that comes from Imagination. Here's Kanter with more details: Apple's GPU appears to still use some of the PowerVR fixed-function graphics hardware. However, based on a variety of public evidence, it is clear that Apple has replaced the programmable shader cores with their own more efficient and higher performance design. To take advantage of the custom shader cores, Apple also developed their own driver and compiler to emit code for its architecture. The overall result is that while Apple's GPU shares some heritage with PowerVR, it is a unique and proprietary design. What's interesting is that Imagination Technologies didn't report anything unusual from a licensing or royalty payment perspective as Apple transitioned from the A7 chip to the A8 chip. Indeed, during Imagination's fiscal year ended on April 30, 2015, the company reported royalty revenue growth of 9%. The company said unit shipments from non-MIPS processors -- in other words, Imagination's PowerVR graphics -- were flat year over year while the average royalty rate in non-MIPS processors went up because of "a better mix." If Apple's move to more customized GPU technology led to a significant reduction in per-unit royalty payments to Imagination Technologies, then the company's average non-MIPS royalty rate should have gone down rather than move up 9%. Apple is a large enough customer of Imagination's that a significant content reduction in Apple's devices would lead to a large drop in non-MIPS royalty revenue. Investment takeaway The conclusion, at least for now, is that even though Apple has built up significant graphics technology expertise in-house, it still relies on valuable intellectual property that Imagination Technologies developed. Since Imagination's PowerVR licensing and royalty performance have apparently been unaffected by Apple's move to a custom graphics processor, it might be reasonable to expect Imagination Technologies to continue to collect royalty payments for the foreseeable future, even as Apple continues to advance its own graphics processor designs.

Apple Now Selling Refurbished iPhones Online Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Apple Now Selling Refurbished iPhones Online Image courtesy of William Hook November 8, 2016 3:46 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler buy a new old phone apple iphone iPhone 7 devices smartphones trade in refurbished iphones refurbished online sales Before today, you could purchase a refurbished iPad or Mac — but not an iPhone — online from Apple. That’s changing as the tech company is now offering customers the chance to purchase refurbished iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus online.  9to5 Mac reports that Apple’s online refurb store is stocked with iPhones for the first time. The eight phones listed, which cost either $529 or $589, will save customers an estimated 15% compared to purchasing a brand new device. According to Apple’s website, the refurbished phones are unlocked, SIM-free, include a new battery and outer shell, and come with a one-year factory warranty. “We test and certify all Apple refurbished products,” the company says, noting that supplies are “limited and availability is guaranteed once we receive your full payment.” Apple’s decision to sell refurbished phones online comes nine months after Apple began accepting trade-ins of newer iPhones with cracked screens and other dings. Still, 9to5 Mac reports that the phones are probably coming from the company’s iPhone Upgrade Program, which likely saw an influx of iPhone 6s devices with the recent release of the iPhone 7.

The new glossy white color might not seem like a bad idea, and it could boost the sales of the new iPhones, especially considering how popular the Jet Black color is.   However, Apple previously launched new colors for their devices only with the release of the new iPhones with the exception of the iPhone 4 which came out in the new white color a year after the launch.

This should come as no surprise to those who’ve long perceived the Mac platform as inward-looking, limited in compatibility, and generally worse value for money than comparable Windows alternatives. Pros are smart with their tools and their money, after all. But the change with Apple’s 2016 generation of MacBook Pros is that those downsides have been amped up — more expensive and less compatible than ever before — to an extreme that exposes the fallacy of the continued use of the Pro moniker. These are Apple’s premium laptops, its deluxe devices, but not in any meaningful way computers tailored for the pros. A MacBook Pro is now simply what you buy if you’re in the Apple ecosystem and have a higher budget and expectations than the MacBook can fulfill. Those complaining about Apple's current Mac lineup are not haters, they're lovers. They've spent 10+ years and 5+ figures on Macs. — Jeff J. (@lapcatsoftware) October 29, 2016 The backlash from among pro Mac users that’s arisen in the wake of this new product launch is unprecedented, drowning out even the widespread grumbling about the loss of the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 just a month prior. Just take a look at this studious blog post from Michael Tsai, which gathers together the broad negative consensus from among Apple's most passionate followers. The Mac community finds the specs underwhelming, even on the 15-inch model, which uses power-sipping AMD Radeon graphics instead of the world-conquering Nvidia Pascal chips. Emotions are running so low that people are even speculating about whether Apple should do with the Mac what IBM did when it sold off the ThinkPad line to Lenovo. This is partially because Apple hasn’t had a class-leading professional Mac computer for years — the Mac Pro is 1,054 days old now — and the new laptops have given an outlet and reason for expectant fans to vent. Many people were clinging on to their aging MacBook Pros in the vain hope of seeing a major spec and performance upgrade that simply didn’t materialize, and that's been frustrating. Here's how the 15" #MacBookPro 2016 component specs compare to the 2012 model: CPU: +8.9% to +13% MEM: +33% GPU: +53% to +184% /cc @mjtsai pic.twitter.com/uucjBzXe6C— Felix Schwarz (@felix_schwarz) October 28, 2016 The updated MacBooks from Apple have newer chips, but not that much newer, with Apple using yesteryear’s Intel Skylake CPUs and not this year’s Kaby Lake. They have faster storage, which is an indisputable benefit, but they also max out at 16GB of RAM. For consumer or casual use, that’s perfectly adequate, but "for a developer work machine, 16GB is the uncomfortable minimum requirement," as web developer Baldur Bjarnason points out. Apple seems surprised by the predictable backlash at betraying the trust of its most loyal customers Here’s the thing: if these new MacBooks simply didn’t carry the Pro label, we’d all have a lot less to complain about. It’s perfectly okay for a company to craft expensive, niche devices that will only match the particular needs of a select group of people. But over the course of the past decade or two, the entire tech industry has moved away from labeling things as exclusive or luxurious, opting for more inclusive language. If you can’t afford the premium model, that implies you’re not wealthy enough; but if you can’t afford the pro version, maybe you’re just not that into it. A subtle, but important distinction. And so it is, that we’re now living in a world populated by the PS4 Pro, DJI Mavic Pro, Surface Pro, iPad Pro, Beats Pro, Logitech Pro Gaming Mouse, and many others. Those of us old enough to remember ATI, the Canadian graphics card company that was taken over by AMD, will remember it pioneered many of these tags with such historic GPUs as the Radeon 9500 Pro, 9800 SE, X800 XT, and so on. They’re all meaningless as far as the company is concerned, but it just so happens that the "Pro" appendage is more meaningful to users than slapping on a "Plus" or "XL." With the obvious exception of leisure-time devices like the PlayStation console, a "pro" piece of consumer electronics is generally interpreted as a signal to actual professionals that this machine is for them. I'm out of apologia juice for defending Apple going with 4 USB-C ports on the new MacBook over a useful mix and keeping the MagSafe. — DHH (@dhh) October 28, 2016 Apple’s folly is in not recognizing just how passionate and committed its professional audience is. But the company should already know that all the iOS app developers that generate its unparalleled third-party software ecosystem are doing their work on Macs. It should be aware of their RAM requirements and the improvements they most want to see. "Pro" used to mean something when it came at the end of MacBook model names Beyond developers, there are the photographers and video producers that have made Mac computers the central hub of their home and work studios for many years, thanks to Apple’s early prioritization of high-quality displays and intuitive software. Leaving them without an SD card slot or an included adapter runs entirely counter to Apple’s fundamental principles of having a coherent ecosystem and a more user-friendly approach than the (previously) cold and aloof Windows PC manufacturers. Apple used to be a friend to creative professionals, and now that it’s acting against their wishes and interests, it seems surprised at their impassioned negative response. The backlash to the new MacBook Pro is so bad that Apple has slashed its accessory prices and LG's monitors to appease. Seems unprecedented — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) November 7, 2016 MacBook Pros were once professional computers that could also appeal to an aspiring consumer audience. They were pricey for a general-purpose laptop, but justifiable as a luxury purchase or as a device that pays for itself by making its user more efficient and productive. But today MacBook Pros are very definitely consumer devices that only gesture toward a professional audience without truly endeavoring to appease it. The new Touch Bar is not a pro feature. It’s cool, it works really well, and it has tons of potential for the future, but it clashes with professional workflows, many of which involve external monitors and keyboards. Apple showed how DJs might use it, but those same people would probably prefer to have dongle-free USB ports for the rest of their gear and a MagSafe charging adapter in the event of some inebriated clubber tripping over their cables. None of Apple's additions improve professional workflows yet, and its subtractions will lead to plenty of headaches The ultra-flat keyboard with 0.55mm key travel is also not professionally minded. Its purpose is overall thinness, but I know of no app developers, globetrotting businesspeople, or digital artists that had "more thinness" anywhere near the top of their priority list of MacBook Pro improvements. Professional writers might have asked for more tactile response, not less, and Apple's keyboard alterations seem to primarily serve to optimize and harmonize its design rather than enhance any functionality. Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pros carry on the Pro moniker dishonestly. At least we should all hope that's the case — because if Apple actually believes that these new laptops are suitable and sufficient for intensive professional needs, then the company's long and happy relationship with creatives may be heading toward a calamitous breakup.

Our Paper Paper Archive Our Apps Daily Horoscope Home News Sport Showbiz & TV Life & Style Travel Tech Pics Casino Gaming Reviews Tech News Home Tech Tech News If this iPhone 7 rumour is true you might want to wait before buying one If this iPhone 7 rumour is true you might want to wait before buying one APPLE'S iPhone 7 could be getting an all-new colour scheme and it could be the one everybody wants. By Dave Snelling / Published 8th November 2016 APPLE RUMOUR: The iPhone 7 could be getting a new colour scheme Apple's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus only launched in September but it seems the devices could already be getting a new feature. According to Japanese website Mac Otakara, Apple looks set to unleash their flagship smartphone in an all-new "Jet White" colour. The iPhone 7 already ships in five colours including Silver, Gold, Black, and Rose Gold. There's also the new, and extremely popular, Jet Black finish which has completely sold out across the globe. In fact, this model is in such demand even Apple themselves have run out of stock with fans having to wait 4-6 weeks to get one. MacOtakara COMING SOON? Apple could release an iPhone 7 in Jet White So will Apple actually unveil a white model? Mac Otakara has been correct before about features coming to the iPhone 7 including the Jet Black colour and loss of the headphone port. But it's also got a few things very wrong including predicting the iPhone SE would arrive in bright pink. So, for now, if you're hoping for the iPhone 7 in white we wouldn't hold your breath but it certainly looks pretty tasty. EXCLUSIVE: New Apple Store opens in London take a peek inside Thursday, 13th October 2016 APPLE is opening its new flagship store in London and Daily Star Online has had an exclusive tour. 1 / 23 The last time Apple introduced a white colour scheme was when the US tech giant unveiled the iPhone 5c. This device was released on September 20, 2013, along with its flagship counterpart, the iPhone 5S. Three years later the iPhone has been hugely improved with the 7 and 7 Plus now including a bigger display, updated camera, faster processor and water resistant design.

The smartphone’s “jet black” tone has proved enormously popular, selling out across the world. 1 A screenshot from Mac Otakara, showing the rumoured “jet white” colour Now the tech giant is rumoured to be planning to unveil an even shinier colour. A Japanese website called Mac Otakara claimed Apple fans will soon be able to get their hands on an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus in virginal white. However, Apple experts at Mac Rumours warned the “rumours may not materialise and should be treated with a proverbial grain of salt”. The website wrote: “Mac Otakara has accurately leaked information about Apple’s upcoming plans in the past, including the new Jet Black color and no 3.5mm headphone jack on iPhone 7. “It was also correct about several other iPhone 7 details, including its naming, flush Home button, longer earpiece cutout, and lack of Smart Connector.

The update, which can be downloaded by anyone enrolled in the public beta program offers a preview of the new TV app, designed to make it easier to find content across multiple video apps and services. The TV app was announced at Apple’s Mac event last month and will also be present on the Apple TV’s tvOS software. It will allow users to sync content between both devices and pick up viewing where they left off. Related: 7 Common iOS 10 probkems and how to fix them Elsewhere, there’s new Unicode 9 emojis, which include a clown, bacon, a selfie, a cowboy hat face, a sneezing face and a whiskey glass among other completely essential items. The beta also brings some brand new camera options, including the ability to preserve the last-used capture state (e.g. square, video, slo-mo, etc.). There’s also support for an SOS feature which will send out a call for help when a user presses the power button 5 times in a row. The Messages app gets a new ‘Celebration’ effect, while iPhone 7 owners will also be able to enjoy three new wallpapers. The update is certainly more significant than the iOS 10.1 release which fixed a few bugs and added the new Portrait camera mode for iPhone 7 Plus users. Apple released the iOS 10.2 beta to developers last week. The completed version will probably be rolled out to everyone next month. Want an early peak? You can sign up for the beta here. Once registered, you'll need to install a profile granting you early access through Software Updates. We'd advise you to only install on a secondary device that has been recently backed up.

The app closely mimics the design of Apple's dedicated support website, providing a list of the products owned by each user along with options for scheduling repairs in an Apple Store or chatting with Apple's support staff. It also has a section for recent repair requests and other information related to Apple product maintenance. Need help? Apple Support app is your personalized guide to the best options from Apple.

Apple Support is here to help.Apple Support appears to be limited to the Netherlands at this time, but Apple may be testing it in a single market before opting to roll it out to other countries. Rumors late last year suggested a support app was in the works, but it wasn't clear at the time if it would be a standalone app or something built into an existing app. Tag: Apple Support [ 29 comments ] Top Rated Comments (View all) dannyyankou 1 week ago Wow, a new service from Apple that doesn't start out in the US.

While at the same time Apple has announced its own line of Apple Watches. The preorders for the Gear S3 have been available since yesterday, the 6th of November and they will hit retailer’s shelves just before the Christmas season pops up. These devices are going to be available at stores such as Amazon, Macy’s, Best Buy and obviously on Samsung’s personal website. The Samsung watches are going to be available in two different models the Classic model and the Frontier one. The price is going to be the same for both of the versions, and they will cost $350. The only difference being the aspect that they bring and that the Frontier model is going to come with LTE support. The Frontier one is going to come with LTE support because it is an outdoor themed watch, and in case of a sticky situation it might come quite in handy. Samsung’s Gear S3 is going to be quite large in size. They will ship with 42 mm cases, and it will be 0.51 inches thick. Both of the devices are water proof and also dust resistant. The display they will sport is a 1.3 inch display, and they will also come with Samsung Pay compatibility giving the user the option to leave his wallet at home. The smart watches are going to come with 4 GB of internal storage space and they are going to be powered by 380 mAh batteries that can last up to three days after a full charge. The price of the devices might still vary a bit, since they will come in 4G versions as well and that price is going to be decided their network carriers.

With the expected increase in users who would be buying stuff online, fake shopping apps have started to pop up like crazy on Apple’s App Store. To remedy this, the Cupertino giant is doing some purging of bogus apps.  The New York Times ran a story over the weekend about the upsurge of rogue apps in Apple’s iOS App Store. These apps are said to be from developers in China, and they are either relatively harmless or very annoying with the amount of pop-up ads they contain. Meanwhile, others could have been designed to retrieve customer data such as credit card information. Security experts have said that China is the biggest source of fake apps that manage to pass through Apple’s monitors because their developers simply change the names and credentials and resubmit similar apps once the bogus ones have been caught.  One of the producers of fake apps that was identified by Apple is Footlocke Sports. The developer was found to have been the source of bogus apps for Celine, Puma, Nike, Canada Goose and more. Related Stories Jet White iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus: Apple May Reportedly Add Color Option Microsoft Selfie App Arrives In Android Play Store Apple Not Releasing iPhone SE Successor In 2017? The biggest mistake that consumers can make when stumbling upon any of the fake shopping apps is ordering items from them that are never going to arrive. This is reportedly just a trick that is mainly there to capture the attention of users and lure them into purchasing items by entering their credit card info, according to AppleInsider.  In response to the issue, Apple has now removed the fraudulent apps from Footlocke Sports and reassured users users are safe from scams as the navigate the App Store. “We strive to offer customers the best experience possible and we take their security very seriously. We've set up ways for customers and developers to flag fraudulent or suspicious apps, which we promptly investigate to ensure the App Store is safe and secure,” Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said. Since other bogus apps are still lurking on Apple’s App Stores, PhoneArena advises that everyone should be in the lookout for shady apps. The tech news site claims that to easily spot if an app is a phoney, users should check out its description for bad English and find out if its it has questionable reviews. Also, whenever possible, consumers are reminded to check the official websites and trusted online stores of the things they want to purchase. This way, the possibility of getting scammed is very minimal.  This is not the first time that Apple removed apps from its App Stores over certain issues. In September, the tech giant started to evaluate apps for problems and identify which ones were not updated. The difference between then and now is the fact that the cleanup that was conducted before targeted apps that were bereft of updates.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Firefighters knock down structure fire in Apple Valley on Monday night Tuesday Nov 8, 2016 at 11:01 AM Nov 8, 2016 at 11:01 AM Jose Quintero Staff Writer @dd_jquintero APPLE VALLEY — Fire officials were investigating a Monday night carport fire that burned a motorhome, truck and boat in the 9800 block of Mockingbird Avenue. Apple Valley Fire Protection District personnel responded to the blaze a little after 10:20 p.m. after receiving reports of a structure fire. As firefighters were en route to the fire they received additional reports of explosions. Firefighters arrived on scene and found a “large” carport fire that threatened nearby exposures, including a home and garage, according to Capt. Rich Unferdorfer. Responding firefighters went into an aggressive attack and knocked the fire out in under 20 minutes, he said. A nearby office trailer sustained minor “side damage” from the fire, but the garage and house did not sustain any damage. The carport, motorhome, truck and boat were all deemed a complete loss and firefighters remained on scene for extensive mop up until 1:30 a.m. Unferdorfer said three AVFPD engines, brush patrol, prevention officer and a battalion chief responded to the blaze. CalFire also responded with an engine and battalion chief, he said. The cause of fire was under investigation Tuesday morning, Unferdorfer said.

Comparing Microsoft's New Surface Book to Apple's MacBook Pro Apple and Microsoft both announced new notebooks designed to appeal to business and consumers alike. Is the new MacBook Pro or Surface Book right for you? Let's See How the Screen Sizes Measure Up One of the first things to consider before buying a MacBook Pro or Surface Book is screen size. The MacBook Pro ships in both 13-inch and 15-inch varieties. The Surface Book with Performance Base has a 13.5-inch screen. Anyone looking for a larger screen will need to choose Apple's option. Both computers, though, feature outstanding display clarity and quality. Check Out the Processor Options On performance, Microsoft's Surface Book with Performance Base has a slight edge. The device ships with a sixth-generation Intel Core i7 processor and support for a higher-end graphics chip in the Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M. Depending on the version customers pick, the lower-end MacBook Pro models come with an Intel Core i5 chip, while bigger models have Intel Core i7 processors. On the graphics side, Apple offers up to an AMD Radeon 455. Both options top out at 16GB of RAM. The Surface Book Has a Touch Screen If a touch screen is important, the Surface Book with Performance Base is the best option. Apple has decided against a touch screen in the MacBook Pro, saying it doesn't fit well with a notebook. Microsoft, however, believes it's a must-have. Customers ultimately will determine which company is right. The MacBook Pro Has the Touch Bar While the MacBook Pro doesn't have a touch screen, it does have what Apple calls the Touch Bar. The component is a multitouch strip that sits above the keyboard and gives users access to software controls. Apple has opened the Touch Bar to third-party developers to ensure apps come with the software functions users want. Depending on its developer support, the Touch Bar could be either a gimmick or the MacBook Pro's secret weapon. Choose Between a Pure Notebook and a Hybrid PC Customers ultimately will need to decide whether a hybrid is important to them when choosing between the two computers. Apple's MacBook Pro is a standard notebook with a clamshell design. The Surface Book comes with a hinge that allows it to be used as both a notebook and a tablet. The difference is an important one that shouldn't be overlooked. The Surface Book Supports a Stylus Unlike the MacBook Pro, the Surface Book supports a stylus. Using the Microsoft Surface Pen, users can draw on the screen, sign documents and perform other creative actions. Since Apple's computer doesn't support a stylus or any touch input, for that matter, creative professionals might find a more suitable option in Microsoft's computer. Big Battery Life Could Be a Decisive Factor Apple promises 10 hours of battery life in the MacBook Pro, delivering solid mixed-use performance during the day. However, Microsoft is the clear winner here, offering up to 16 hours of battery life. While mileage may vary depending on how the computers are used, the Surface Book is the best option for anyone needing a bit more battery life to get through the day. Neither Model Is Over-Equipped With Ports Neither the MacBook Pro nor the Surface Book with Performance Base is a real winner when it comes to port support. Apple's MacBook Pro comes with four Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack. The Surface Book ships with two USB 3.0 ports, an SD Card reader, a headphone jack and a Mini DisplayPort. Which computer wins depends on the accessories owners want to plug into their machine. Software Compatibility Considerations The Surface Book runs Windows 10 Pro, which is compatible with numerous applications of every description for consumers and business users. It also includes some important security enhancements. The MacBook Pro runs on macOS Sierra, which also works with a huge stock of existing applications. While Apple has done a fine job of adding more support for third-party applications, Windows is still the platform most developers design their apps for first. It All Comes Back to Pricing Inevitably, some customers will choose their computer based on price. However, neither option is cheap. The Surface Book with Performance Base starts at $2,399 and goes up to $3,299 for the highest-end option. Apple's Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro starts at $1,799 for the 13-inch model and tops out at $2,799 for the highest-end version. Customizations to the machine will push the price higher.

First up was Microsoft, which showcased the Surface Book with Performance Base, a new version of its popular two-in-one hybrid computer. Just a day later, Apple announced its long-awaited MacBook Pro update that includes a new Touch Bar feature. Both the Microsoft and Apple computers have nice designs, the latest software and enough processing power to appeal to power users. Both are also compact but come with powerful features that could make them attractive options for home and business users alike. Altogether their specifications are good enough that they likely will be among the most sought-after notebooks during the holiday season. This slide show takes a closer look at the Surface Book with Performance Base and the new MacBook Pro to see if either of these computers has an advantage. Check out the following slides to learn more about the similarities and differences between these two notebook PCs.           Don Reisinger is a freelance technology columnist.
