After last Friday's cataclysmic false-alarm, threads on Reddit are now saying Apple Music representatives are claiming that the LP will be released within "48-72 hours," versus the November 13, 2016 release Ocean's site indicated. For all we know, these Apple employees could have been bots, but Pigeons and Planes tested out the reps themselves, and made them confirm that they were, in fact, human. Uh. It continues... But why would an Apple tech support person know when a clandestine album release would be out? I would tell someone anything they wanted to hear just to get them off the phone; I don't blame them for playing along! Frank, just release it.

Apple is launching iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in 12 regions including Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore, the U.K., and the U.S. (Ken Ishii/Getty Images) No one is expecting the iPhone 7 to smash sales records or even improve much on the current iPhone 6S. The main reason for this is that the iPhone will celebrate its first 10th anniversary in the smartphone industry next year. Part of the expected celebration is undoubtedly a new design. The possible issue with that, as noted by Business Insider, is that 2016 is Apple's scheduled time for a revamped handheld. Since 2008, the Cupertino-based company has been working on a two-year clock that has told the public when exactly to expect a relatively grand redesign. So if the September event does confirm that Apple is holding out a new look for the iPhone 8 instead of the impending iPhone 7, it could indicate an entirely new future for Apple. That is, how and when its dedicated customers will be making purchases. Of course, there is also the possibility that this missed year will be a one-time occurrence only. Apple could very well return to the two-year schedule after the 2017 unit. There is, however, at least one ever-surfacing rumor regarding the iPhone 7. That is, that Apple is ditching the standard 3.5mm audio port. Instead, the iPhone 7 is expected to come with either Bluetooth earphones or one that connects to the Lightning port. Whichever way the tech giant decides to go, it needs to do something soon in order to bounce back from its current slump. As Irish Times notes, Apple's second quarter numbers were about 10 million fewer than the previous year's. And while Q3 2016 figures met the company's expectations, it is still a far cry from when Apple first launched the iPhone in 2007. The road Apple is on is not as smooth as it once was and that is obvious. Samsung, one of Apple's largest competitors, is cashing in on this decline in demand. Samsung's second-quarter sales beat its own expectations.

Home Industry Technology Microsoft most innovative place to work: Study Microsoft most innovative place to work: Study Microsoft's employees are more innovative than Apple's, and Facebook's staff are less creative than most tech workers, says a study led by Indian-origin entrepreneur. By: IANS | San Francisco | Published: August 12, 2016 5:06 PM Microsoft’s employees are more innovative than Apple’s, and Facebook’s staff are less creative than most tech workers, says a study led by Indian-origin entrepreneur. (Reuters) Microsoft’s employees are more innovative than Apple’s, and Facebook’s staff are less creative than most tech workers, says a study led by Indian-origin entrepreneur. The findings showed that Facebook lags behind the others in cultivating a culture of creativity. Microsoft employees are more innovative than those at Apple. “The study data tell us that in terms of adventurousness, Microsoft employees tend to be neck-and-neck with Apple’s, and much more adventurous than Google, Facebook, or IBM employees,” Samar Birwadker, Founder and CEO of Good&CO, was quoted as saying to fastcompany.com on Friday. As a result of being among the first social media platforms on the Internet, Facebook may be considered among the most innovative companies in the world. However, its early successes have resulted in a more conservative effort to sustain them. “They have (Facebook) always had that reputation [of being innovative], and I think that now becomes a subconscious thing, that Facebook is innovative, but the current place they are in as a business doesn’t require them to personally be innovative,” Birwadker said. “They (Facebook) invented social networks, and there’s always been this layer of innovation,” Birwadker explained adding, “but with more pressure on revenue, and especially on mobile and advertisements, I think we are seeing a lot less risk taking and adventurousness by their employees.” On the other hand, Microsoft is often perceived as less innovative, because the more established tech giant has lagged behind the growth of its competitors. Microsoft has always made a lot of money doing things the right, traditional, organised way, the study said. “But with the success of social platforms and companies like Google Microsoft realised that they need to focus on consumer first, whereas they have always been B2B,” Birwadker stated, pointing out that with the arrival of Microsoft’s latest CEO, Satya Nadella in 2014, this wave of innovative energy started. Although the giants of the technology industry have a lock on employer branding by their quirky hiring practices, free food, and other perks that make work “fun”, the analysis of the personalities of their staffs presents a different picture. Companies like IBM, Facebook and Google aren’t necessarily providing the working atmosphere that is reflected in their recruiting materials, the study showed. “You can’t have 10 people in a boardroom deciding what the culture of the company is. It is defined by the people who already work there,” Birwadker noted, revealing that employees who discover that their company culture is different than advertised are more likely to leave. In the study, published by Good&Co, the team analysed the psychometric data gained from anonymous personality quizzes completed by 4,364 tech employees of what they believe are perceived as the five most innovative companies in Silicon Valley: Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and IBM. In total, the two-year-long study also analysed 10 million responses from 2,50,000 users. Questions ranged from thoughts and feelings about networking to how they handle problems at work.

Jonathan Braude Aug 12, 2016 12:55 PM EDT Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride sharing giant that last week drove off with Uber's Chinese cab operations, said on Friday that users across China can now hail rides through their Apple Watches while expensing their fares using automated account management provider Concur Technologies. Didi Enterprise, the Beijing company's travel service, said it had put together a new partnership with Concur, of Bellevue, Wash., allowing Concur clients to connect their accounts with Didi Chuxing, select their trip type and begin booking rides. Once travelers arrive at their destination, an e-receipt will be automatically sent to their linked Concur accounts, where they can directly manage their ride expenses and submit for reimbursements. But if travelers already have an Apple Watch, they can hail rides and get live traffic updates during peak hours to help make their commuting easier. The agreement reached with Apple (AAPL) means they can download or upgrade the latest version of the Didi Chuxing app on the Apple Watch. Users can simply press the "go home" button or the "go to work" button to request a ride on the Apple Watch, once the corresponding addresses are set up through Didi Chuxing's iPhone version, Didi said. Apple's $1 billion investment into Didi earlier this year was thought to have been a factor in the Chinese firm's victory over its U.S. rival Uber. Even after spending $1 billion a year on Chinese expansion, it had become clear that San Francisco-based Uber would not have the firepower necessary to out gun Did chuxing on its home market.

And that means another Primal Blueprint Real Life Story from a Mark’s Daily Apple reader. If you have your own success story and would like to share it with me and the Mark’s Daily Apple community please contact me here. I’ll continue to publish these each Friday as long as they keep coming in. Thank you for reading! I have been an avid reader for about three years now. I have struggled with my weight since I was about 13 years old. I suppose drinking six to twelve cokes a day didn’t help. My heaviest known weight was 240 pounds. Most big people don’t go looking for a scale. I know I was that big because that was when I was diagnosed as a Type II Diabetic. Of course, even that didn’t stop the coke habit because I was in denial. It took several more years of losing 30 pounds, and then finding it again, to get really serious. Even then, the path is never a straight line. Three years ago July, I found an online nutrition coaching program—Precision Nutrition, a year long habit based program. At the same time, my wife told me that an ex-colleague of ours, who at 50 was in fantastic shape, was doing CrossFit and Paleo. I had never heard of either one. When I Googled Paleo I found Mark’s website. Even doing the year long coaching program, I still wasn’t where I wanted to be with my health. While I did remove all processed foods, especially Coke, I still was about 190 pounds. I am 5’10”. I have done lots of reading and research. I learned about leptin from Dr. Jack Kruse. I started to understand how chronic inflammation due to insulin resistance was the root cause of my problems. I also found Dr. Jason Fung—a huge advocate of fasting. While I had lots of information, putting it into practice is always the hard part. On February 7 of this year, I had elbow surgery for a repetitive motion injury from 25+ years of IT work. I knew that Naproxin wreaked havoc on my system, but post surgery you need something to get you through. Eight weeks ago I had a physical. My A1c was 6.6, which is high for me. I was up to 197 pounds and was not happy about it. I decided to do a n=1 experiment where I would utilize fasting and real food. I decided to have coffee in the morning and eat one meal a day for eight weeks. I am now down to 175. My blood glucose has normalized. I am in ketosis and feel great. I have plenty of energy to take on whatever sounds good. I move a lot at a slow pace. A year ago I got a Varidesk and ditched my chair. I have been standing while working for a year now. If I can do this—anyone can. I also signed up for the Primal Health Coach Program the first day it was available. I am proud top say I am number 93.

So inspiring to see people eliminate their health issues through a better diet and lifestyle. I generally fast between dinner (around 6pm) and lunch the next day (around 11am). Back in the days when I was eating a lot of grain products, I’d be munching something two hours later. That doesn’t happen with a Paleo/Primal diet. 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Ryan 3 months 11 days ago Nice job!

I had a chuckle at your “years of losing 30 pounds, and then finding it again.” It points out how odd the English language is with “losing pounds,” like it’s a simple “Whoops, where did THAT just go?” I speak some German, but not perfectly, so I once translated it literally in a conversation and then got a puzzled silence before I realized my mistake. Their way of saying it is commonly “abnehmen,” which is sort of like “to take (away) or reduce.” I prefer the German because it gives a nod to… Read more » 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Monica 3 months 10 days ago This is a great story.

The more (non starchy) vegetable you are eating, the more micronutrients you are getting. Combining them with high quality fat and protein makes for a satisfying meal. I try to eat several servings of veggies with breakfast, lunch and dinner. I’ve never really struggled with my weight or fat loss, but I think the vegetables definitely help me stay on track. 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ marco 3 months 10 days ago Thanks, I mean I figured that they are important but you don’t hear enough how vegetables also help.

The key is to give veggies “love” to make them delicious. I like plain steamed broccoli as much as the next girl, but add a balsamic vinaigrette and now you have deliciousness on a plate. The veggies provide plenty of nutrients and lots of fiber, and by eating several different veggies with a protein, I don’t want anything else. I’ve learned to like almost all vegetables; the trick is what you do with them. Even Brussels sprout haters will like them cooked in garlic butter and served… Read more » 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ marco 3 months 10 days ago I really should say fat loss 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ marco 3 months 10 days ago And congrats on everything, it cant seem to be that simple for me. 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ wildgrok 3 months 10 days ago Hi Rick Congratulations from another IT person with elbow surgery also! 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Vernon 3 months 9 days ago Great job Rick.

By FoxNews.com on Aug 12, 2016 at 7:30 PM Mobile Share This Story Tweet Like Share Submit Shop ▾ Image Source: Apple While the upcoming iPhone 7 is expected to have some welcome improvements, the iPhone that Apple is planning for 2017 could be really different. First, let’s review what’s expected for the iPhone 7. Two recent reports from Bloomberg lay out a lot of the details. It’s expected to debut at an Apple event less than a month from now on September 7, but be physically similar to the iPhone 6/6s, a design first introduced in September of 2014. That means Apple will break from its past practice of doing a physical makeover every two years. The iPhone 7’s improvements and changes are expected to include a dual-camera system (possibly similar to Huawei’s P9 smartphone) on one model, a redesigned pressure-sensitive home button, and no headphone jack. Headphones would be connected via the charging port or Bluetooth. Wait for the iPhone 8? The iPhone 8 should be the device that moves Apple into the future. It may not be a coincidence that 2017 will be the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. So, it’s conceivable that Apple is waiting for that date to bring out an overhauled iPhone. So far, speculation points to a 2017 iPhone that could be based on a glass body, according to a report this week from Nikkei, Japan’s largest business newspaper. “Apple is expected to redesign the iPhone, including giving it a glass chassis,” Nikkei reported. That glass casing could be made by Apple manufacturing partner Foxconn, Nikkei said, citing a source with knowledge of Apple component suppliers in Taiwan. “Foxconn has been trying [to develop a] glass chassis since last year,” Nikkei quoted the source as saying. But probably the most stunning part of the redesign would be the rumored move from the current LCD (liquid crystal) display to an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display, which is a rumor repeated by Nikkei. That would theoretically enable Apple to revamp the iPhone’s physical look-and-feel and— as one possibility— offer a curved display with higher resolution and more vibrant colors. A major redesign along those lines is practically necessary for Apple because Samsung already offers the highly-praised Galaxy S7 Edge with an OLED display that’s curved along the two lengthwise edges of the phone. That gives Samsung a clear technological advantage over Apple. “Right now, the Galaxy Note 7 is far more advanced than what Apple offers and, my bet, more advanced than what the iPhone 7 will offer,” Todd Haselton, a writer for tech media site TechoBuffalo, told Foxnews.com in an email. “Several rumors have suggested Apple is moving toward an OLED display next year, which will be a good first step [toward closing the gap],” he added. Apple could also combine hardware improvements with new software and services, Rushabh Doshi, an analyst with market researcher Canalys, told FoxNews.com. “We expect Apple to focus strongly on service innovation. Artificial Intelligence would take center stage in the coming years as the smart phone becomes a true ‘assistant’ to the user,” Doshi said. “[The] recent acquisition of Turi continues to underline the importance of AI for Apple,” Doshi said. Neither Apple nor Foxconn would comment on the Nikkei report. Related US Air Force’s plan to improve radio communications?

HP’s Spectre, which the company is touting as the world’s thinnest, is one such example. With its high-quality hardware and refined design, the $999.99 Spectre seriously raises the bar for ultra-thin laptops. Still, there are some important considerations to make before picking one up. Here’s a closer look at what it was like to use the HP Spectre. How it Looks and Feels The HP Spectre looks unlike most other laptops out there. Made of aluminum and carbon fiber, the notebook has a sleek black appearance accented with a shiny gold hinge. HP clearly paid attention to the details here: the keys feature a gold trim to match the notebook’s glossy hinge. Meanwhile, the speakers, located to the left and right of the keyboard, look as if they’ve been etched into the keyboard deck. The gold hinge, however, does have the unfortunate tendency to collect fingerprint smudges. At roughly 0.41 inches thin and 2.45 pounds, the Spectre is supremely slim and light. Apple’s MacBook Air, by comparison, is 0.11 inches thin at its slimmest point but 0.68 inches at its thickest, while Dell’s XPS 13 is between 0.3 and 0.6 inches thin. The Spectre has a 1,920×1,080 resolution 13.3-inch screen, which is sharper than that of the MacBook Air but not as dazzling as those offered on some other ultrabooks. Still, for most people, it’ll be more than adequate for watching Netflix or browsing photos. Using It Keyboard quality is arguably one of the most important characteristics of a laptop. A poor keyboard can make it difficult or just plain frustrating to interact with your computer. Thankfully, the Spectre’s keyboard is among the best I’ve used on a laptop. The key travel is deep, providing rich feedback and making it comfortable to type at a quick pace. It’s exactly what should be expected of a premium notebook. The touchpad, however, could use some improvement. I found it to be sluggish and laggy at times, and I had to tweak a few settings to get an enjoyable experience. If you’re seeking a laptop primarily for work and entertainment, the Spectre should be plenty fast. It runs on Intel’s latest processors, and buyers have the option of choosing between a Core i5 or Core i7. I’ve been using the $1,099 Core i7 variant for a mix of web browsing, casual gaming, light photo editing, and streaming Netflix, and I haven’t come across any stutters or hiccups. However, the Spectre’s fans get noisy fairly often, which can be distracting. Those who typically watch TV shows or blast tunes from their laptop will likely be pleased with the Spectre’s Bang & Olufsen speakers, which offer rich and powerful audio. But the productivity-minded should keep in mind that the Spectre offers only three USB Type-C ports, plus a headphone jack. USB Type-C is certainly the future, but for now you’ll need adapters to connect the Spectre to most equipment — like external monitors. I didn’t get great battery life out of the Spectre, but I believe my testing circumstances were part of the problem. The notebook’s battery depleted after about four hours of use, which is unusually low. That said, the Wi-Fi signal in my office kept dropping in and out over the course of writing this review, and the battery may have been drained while the laptop was searching for a signal. It’s probably safe to expect around six hours of battery life out of the Spectre under normal circumstances. Conclusion With its latest Spectre, HP has proven that there is a way to improve laptop design without compromising the computing experience. The HP Spectre is a marvelously slim, attractive machine that tackles all of the basics, offering a sturdy keyboard and fast performance. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t consider other options. If you don’t need a Core i7 processor and don’t mind something slightly thicker, the Dell XPS 13 is definitely worth a look, especially since it’s about $100 cheaper than HP’s notebook and provides a similar experience. Chromebooks, meanwhile, are increasingly compelling options for the budget-minded. But in general, the Spectre is priced fairly considering most ultrabooks cost around $1,000. All told, HP’s Spectre is a top contender among today’s Windows 10 laptops. 4 out of 5 stars Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next A laser pointer from the stands helped the Oakland Raiders beat the Texans BGR News iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech Donald Trump’s advisors are lying to him Quartz T-Mobile has some of the best Black Friday deals we’ve seen BGR News Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network

Related: Apple Watch 2: Everything you need to know Indeed, some of the newer models with nylon straps are also gone despite only being made available this spring. As the report also states, the larger 42mm versions of the standard Apple Watch are on back order, while custom Hermes-branded options are also sold out online. With Apple seemingly no longer replenishing these stocks amid middling sales, it's safe to assume the company is shifting existing inventory ahead of a refresh. See also: watchOS 3.0: The five killer features Most observers are predicting an Apple Watch 2 with improved battery life, GPS technology and faster processing tech. Some rumours have also suggested it’ll boast superior water resistance and a sleeker design.

About Portfolio Photos Blog Pico Facebook Twitter Tumblr Instagram RSS Gruber & I disagree about a few issues about Apple Posted August 12, 2016 by Om Malik My comments (made on Leo LaPorte’s Twit) about Apple, Eddy Cue and the fragile state of iCloud services have struck a nerve, with most disagreeing with me and only a few actually agreeing with the general sensibility of the comments. One of the co-panelists Philip Elmer-Dewitt disagreed vehemently with what I was saying, though he was in agreement about Planet of the Apps as a distraction. This is coming from the so-called celebrity influx into the company, whether it is through the Beats acquisition or Eddy Cue. I mean, look at Eddy Cue. The guy was hanging out at the playoffs when iCloud was burning. For six hours. You know, he wouldn’t have survived a day if Steve was around. I’m sorry, that’s what gets me worked up about this company. They have all these wrong priorities. They want to do entertainment content? Buy damn Netflix and move on from there. Do it properly if you want to do it. Don’t try to do this stupid penny-ante stuff which adds no value to the company. Absolutely none. Today John Gruber (a dear friend and a fellow Yankees fan) and I find ourselves on opposite sides of the spectrum and he disagrees with me as well. He picked up on my argument that Eddy Cue would have struggled to last under Steve Jobs. Here is what John said: I’ll just point out that Eddy Cue started at Apple in 1989, and reported directly to Jobs while creating and running the iTunes Store, App Store, and iLife suite. You’re free to argue that Cue is doing a shitty job, but “he wouldn’t have survived a day if Steve was around” doesn’t hold water. And the whole thing about Cue attending a Golden State Warriors game — game one of the NBA Finals — during an iCloud outage is nonsense. If Cue had skipped the game, the iCloud outage would not have been fixed a minute sooner. Not one minute. I think Gruber is missing the point — attending a game when a division you are responsible for is down for six hours is a clear lack of empathy for the customers, and also is a sign that standards are falling of what used to be an Apple Standard for building products of delight. Sure, things might have taken as much time to fix the iCloud, but the message you would have sent out to rest of the Apple team would have been different. In the wake of Antenna Gate, I distinctly remember reading about the then Apple executive responsible for hardware, Mark Papermaster leaving the company. “From what I’ve heard, its clear he was sacked,” John wrote on his blog. The continuous iCloud and Apple Services challenges are on the same plane as far as I am concerned, as they impact millions of users. If Apple is indeed serious about services and its services business, it needs to own up to the fact that it’s iCloud can’t go down for six hours. This isn’t 1999! And the company’s executive team needs to show with actions and not just words, and that means leader of its services oriented products must prioritize uptime over Steph Curry! Sometimes the game isn’t just a game! *** On another note, Gruber disagrees with my argument that Apple should buy Netflix and writes: … he’s off his rocker on this one. I’m as skeptical as anyone about this Planet of the Apps show and why Apple is producing it. But I highly doubt it’s a distraction for anyone at Apple. It’s not even shooting in the Bay Area; it’s shooting in L.A. Buying Netflix, on the other hand, would be a huge distraction. I’m not saying it could never happen or would certainly be a bad idea, but Apple’s services are built to take advantage of its hardware. Netflix is the opposite — it’s a service designed to be available on any device with a screen. With iTunes, Apple already has a library of movies and TV shows. If Apple wants to produce original content, they could start their own production company for a tiny fraction of Netflix’s $42 billion market cap. A fraction. To me, this reads as Om being bored with Apple, and wanting them to just do something. Actually it not me being bored with Apple, but pointing out what Apple observers constantly miss — Internet services and infrastructure are its Achilles heel. They are in tough competition with services provided by Internet native giants like Google, Amazon and Facebook. Even Microsoft has decided that desktop is their past. Ask around the cloud-circles, and even the most generous souls give Apple’s infrastructure and its growing army a “B” at best. Whether it is Siri or Music or even the always syncing desktops, Apple’s infrastructure has to work flawlessly – and not go off for hours at length. Like this: Like Loading...

AP Images. Trump, Clinton Agree On One Thing The Trans-Pacific Partnership hasn’t had much love from the candidates during this election cycle. Donald Trump came out swinging against the deal from the start of the campaign, and after getting pressure from Bernie Sanders during the primaries, Hillary Clinton also flip-flopped her stance and opposed the deal. This week in Michigan, both presidential candidates gave economic policy speeches and the 12-nation trade deal. Trump called the agreement a disaster and went as far to say “a vote for Clinton is a vote for TPP.” Clinton, in her speech Thursday, took a tougher stance: “I oppose it now. I’ll oppose it after the election, and I’ll oppose it as president.” Not everyone, Trump included, seems convinced Clinton won’t flip-flop again if she’s elected.

In an amicus brief filed with the courts last week, designers including Alexander Wang, Calvin Klein and Nicolas Ghesquière filed in support of Apple. Tech giants such as Facebook, Google and Microsoft have sided with Samsung. The court will answer whether a company violating another’s patents is required to forfeit all profits, when only parts of an item are in violation. Historically, brands will surrender all profits, even for a partial violation. “If you think about it in terms of the fashion industry and footwear, there are hundreds of design patents on different aspects of the shoe, like the sole,” explained IP attorney Aaron Parker with Finnegan. “Should you be entitled to all profits of the entire shoe if we’re only talking about a specific portion of a shoe?” IP experts say if the courts rule in favor of Samsung it would blow open previous precedents regarding patents, force designers to more seriously seek design protection and raise serious questions about the value of design. Another important thing to note: The law as it reads now acts as a deterrent preventing patent and intellectual property theft. South China Seas Heating Up New photos revealed this week appear to show reefs and islands built by China in the international trade thoroughfare are being militarized. The news comes just weeks after the International Court of Justice declared that China didn’t have the right to build islands in the area, and after China’s President Xi Jinping promised not to militarized the zone last fall while visiting the U.S. For footwear, the all-important Asian sourcing route will most certainly be affected by the increased tensions with the Chinese moves.

Department Stores Turned a Corner After months of missed comps, disappointing consumer traffic, high promotions and static inventory, Q2 looks like department stores might be turning a corner for 2016. Macy’s, Nordstrom, JCPenney’s and Kohl’s reported better-than-expected earnings that showed steps toward improvement. Most notably, Macy’s garnered attention Thursday after reporting it would close 100 stores and distribute more resources to improving profitable stores, in-store experience and digital efforts. The share price soared 17 percent. Losses at Nordstrom and JCPenney were smaller than expected as stores became increasingly proactive on cutting inventory levels. Kohl’s also picked up pace. “We see reason for increased optimism for the second half based on sequentially improving comp momentum, clean-ish inventories and easy comparisons,” wrote Cowen & Co.’s Olivier Chen in a note to investors about Kohl’s and Macy’s. Analysts say while the steps are in the right direction, department stores aren’t out of the woods yet. — Sign up for the FN Newsletter — Business, Retail, North America, Apple, Macy's, South China Sea, TPP, Trans-Pacific Partnership Share This Article Email Tumblr WhatsApp LinkedIn Post navigation ← Dr. Scholl’s Introduces ‘Be Energized’ Technology For Spring 2017 Line A Look At Ronnie Fieg’s Next Diadora Collaboration → Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Invasion of the tabtops: The new hybrid tablets reviewed What the Microsoft Surface ‘Hat for Your Cat’ takedown ad really means Video Mingis on Tech: The iPhone 7, Apple Watch 2 -- and the gadget guy! Although Apple has recently implied that its iPad Pro tablet could replace a traditional PC, the nascent ad campaign does not signal an immediate change in the company's strategy, an analyst argued today. "The iPad Pro is not the answer to everything," said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies, in an interview. "I don't believe [Apple] thinks there is not a place for the Mac." Milanesi was reacting to questions prompted by commentary she wrote after Apple introduced a new TV advertisement Aug. 1. In the ad, Apple labeled the keyboard-equipped iPad Pro a "computer," and deployed a tag line that said, "Imagine what your computer could do ... if your computer was an iPad Pro." It was the most explicit portrayal of the iPad Pro as stand-in for a PC since Apple introduced the tablet 11 months ago, even though CEO Tim Cook has constructed more straightforward comparisons when talking to Wall Street. "iPad Pro is ... the ultimate replacement device for customers switching from PC notebooks," Cook contended last month during the firm's second-quarter earnings call. Like Microsoft before it, Apple has attempted to stretch the definition of "computer" or "personal computer." Microsoft has been on that path since it unveiled the Surface portfolio of 2-in-1 devices in mid-2012, just prior to the debut of Windows 8. "The iPad Pro is, of course, not the first tablet trying to convince you it can do what your PC does and more," Milanesi wrote on Tech.pinions this week. "Microsoft has been trying to do the same with the Surface." Milanesi concluded that while the two companies' approaches are quite different, both worked towards the same goal. "They are now fighting a battle on opposite fronts but with one common interest -- changing how people think of a PC," she wrote. The iPad Pro ad was more an attempt to change perceptions -- a chore that by necessity will be a long-term effort -- and much less a statement that the tablet with a keyboard is now a PC replacement. "The more you live in apps, the more you think you can get away with [using a tablet rather than a PC]," Milanesi said. "But I don't think there's a rush [by Apple] to get there. They don't have a hybrid [like the Surface Pro]. And they're not going to put touch on a Mac." Part of her reasoning is a belief that Microsoft's approach with the Surface is flawed. There was no question that the Surface kicked off a new -- and growing -- device category, but its impact was diluted. The Surface was different, but in reality, not many actually thought of it in a different way, Milanesi said. Because the Surface runs a desktop OS, albeit one enhanced for touch, users continue to envision their Surface as a personal computer, a PC, burdening the device with decades of meaning and definition. In fact, Microsoft does, too: When a Surface reboots, the on-screen message reads "Your PC is restarting," Milanesi noted, not "Your Surface is restarting." "It is not surprising the Surface commercials show people using the Surface in their non-conventional businesses, and end with 'I could not do that with my Mac,'" Milanesi wrote on Tech.pinions of Microsoft's emphasis on comparing the Surface to a PC. Apple's ad is different. Rather than link the iPad Pro to "PC," Apple referenced "computer." That was intentional. "They never say that this is a 'personal computer,'" Milanesi said. Nor does the latter term resonate with younger users, she maintained. Ask an elementary school-aged child what an iPad is, and their answer will be "computer." "A 'computer' is whatever window gets you into the Internet," Milanesi said. "And the new generation is more touch prone, more into apps, and might think about an iPad more as a computer." And there's the rub. Apple and Microsoft can try to change the answer to the question "What is a PC?" all they want with devices like the iPad Pro and the Surface Pro 4, but there is no evidence they've moved the definition. Or that Apple is itself convinced that a turn is imminent. "There's no pressure on Apple to get out of the personal computer business," said Milanesi. What will it take to change the concept of a personal computer, or a computer for that matter? More ads? More hybrids? More keyboards stuck onto tablets? "Lots of kids growing up, that's what," said Milanesi. To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

While Apple doesn’t divulge specific revenue figures for how many apps it sells, we can still get a sense of how well the business is doing. Apple includes App Store sales along with other items in its “services” revenue, and during Apple’s last business quarter, Apple reported services sales of $5.98 billion, a 19 percent increase from a year ago, making it the company’s second-largest revenue generator. No. 1, by a wide margin, remains the iPhone. And in four years, there could be more than 5 million apps available on the App Store — double the current number of apps — according to Sensor Tower, a research firm and consultancy that helps app developers get their apps downloaded. Sensor Tower said games dominate on the App Store and are the largest category of new apps that end up in the online shop. How big are games? Sensor Tower said that out of more than 48,000 apps that were added to the App Store in May, almost 21,000, or nearly 44 percent, were games. The category with the next-highest number of new apps added? Education, with almost 2,500 new apps. For historical purposes, think of this: There were just 5,000 apps on the App Store at the end of 2008. That number grew to 1.75 million by the end of 2015. Still, adding almost 2.5 million more apps in four years is a tall order. But the growth rates expected as apps take on more prominence in consumers’ daily lives suggest that such a number is attainable. It would certainly make Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook happy and help the company reach his expectations that services will “be the size of a Fortune 100 company next year.”   Middle Innings: Not to make fun of Silicon Graphics, but, really, when was the last time you really thought about the company that was once one of the kings of the computer server market? (Maybe it was around the last time you thought about Sun Microsystems, another one-time server bigwig that’s been part of Oracle since 2010). Well, enough investors thought about Silicon Graphics to send the company’s shares up by almost 29 percent Friday, to end the week at $7.69. That’s what happens when you’re a company that gets bought by Hewlett Packard Enterprise for $275 million. HPE and SGI announced the deal late Thursday, in which HPE said the acquisition would help it strengthen its place in the high-performance computing market. Maybe HPE will use SGI’s technology for high-end data analytics? In which case, maybe it’ll come to some analysis as to why it bought a company that was last viewed as being on the cutting edge of tech back before Facebook was even a dream in Mark Zuckerberg’s mind. Welcome To The Grotto: Amazon is going to produce a 13-episode docu-series about the history of Playboy and its iconic founder, Hugh Hefner. As the market for original and exclusive programming by online video-streaming companies grows, few brands evoke an immediate feeling of — excitement? sentimentality? — than Playboy, so it can’t hurt to have that name attached to your program lineup. It probably won’t hurt Amazon’s production efforts that the company is said to have gotten access to 17,000 hours of unseen video footage and 2,600 of Hef’s personal scrapbooks. And you know those scrapbooks aren’t just full of articles. Bottom Of The Lineup:  Here’s a look at how some leading Silicon Valley stocks did Friday … Movin’ On Up: Gains came from InvenSense, Oclaro, Rocket Fuel, Nvidia and NeoPhotonics. In The Red: Decliners included Genomic Health, Barracuda Networks, Aemetis, ServiceSource International and Impax Laboratories.   The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.1 percent to 5,232. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average slipped by 0.2 percent to 18,576. And the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index edged down by 0.1 percent to 2,184.

Sections Deseret NewsUtah Utah What still needs to be done for true workforce diversity and equality Compiled by Sarah Anderson For the Deseret News Published: Aug. 12, 2016 3:00 p.m. 6 Comments Apple recently joined other tech giants in announcing it pays employees the same amount for similar jobs and performances, regardless of gender or race, and is also working toward a more diverse workforce by hiring more women and minorities. “We’ve achieved pay equity in the United States for similar roles and performance,” the latest Apple report stated. “Women earn one dollar for every dollar male employees earn. And underrepresented minorities earn one dollar for every dollar white employees earn.” The company reported that it was stepping up its diverse hires, with new women hires up from 31 percent in 2014 to 37 percent today, and “underrepresented” minority new hires up from 21 percent in 2014 to 27 percent, CNN.com noted. Underrepresented minorities do not include Asians, it continued, as they represent 19 percent of Apple’s workforce and 24 percent of new hires. The Huffington Post noted that a previous critic of Apple’s diversity, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, has come out in support of the company’s efforts to increase diversity by recruiting engineers of color from “historically black colleges and universities and scholarship organizations.” “They are clearly setting the pace, making measurable progress for three consecutive years. They’ve acted with intention, not just aspiration,” Jackson said in a statement, according to The Huffington Post. And while welcome, these steps toward diversity are just that — a few steps. As Fortune.com noted, men make up 62 percent of Apple’s leadership, same as last year. And the number of white people in leadership has increased, from 63 percent last year to 67 percent this year. To be fair, Fortune.com noted this may be result of the “undeclared” ethnic category that was eliminated this year. Apple also isn’t the first tech/digital company to announce that it pays its employees equally – Amazon, PayPal and Microsoft made similar announcements earlier this year, Fortune.com noted. But Forbes contributor Tim Worstall argued “even if absolutely every employer in America managed to do this we would still see gender and minority pay gaps.” The issue isn’t solely or mainly about employers discriminating among employees rather a case of “who works where doing what, not how the people doing the same job are treated,” it continued. For example, men and women tend to do different jobs, so pay equality between men and women in the same job may not mean much for overall gender equality. And the pay gap between minorities, such as African-Americans and Hispanics, and whites may be tied to the different educational opportunities each has, Worstall wrote. The numbers of minorities employed by Apple are still small, with 9 percent black employees and 12 percent Hispanic, The Washington Post noted, but it’s still better than others in its industry. As of January, black and Hispanic employees make up 2 and 3 percent of Google’s workforce, it continued. Whereas black and Hispanic employees make up 2 and 4 percent of Facebook’s workforce. It has been suggested by critics that Apple has a more diverse workforce because it employs lower-paid workers in its retail stores, which Facebook and Google lack, The Washington Post said. Still, there was a 1 percent increase for women and blacks in Apple’s technical jobs, it continued.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us CVS Pay mobile payment service added to the CVS Pharmacy app By R Padla - August 12, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter We already knew of the idea that the CVS Pharmacy would be launching its own mobile payment service. We heard it would utilize mainly Apple Pay but this week, the company finally unveiled CVS Pay and no, it won’t be related to anything from Apple or Google. Instead of integration with any existing payment service available, CVS is introducing its own. CVS Pay is yet another mobile payments platform that will be exclusive to payments for CVS Pharmacy transactions much like Walmart Pay is to Walmart. If you may remember not so long ago, CVS once dropped the idea of NFC mobile payments not because they cause problems but because they were part of the Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX). Back then, the latter was once believed to be developing its own mobile payment system called CurrentC. CurrentC has been on beta for quite a while now but it has seen a number of issues. Meanwhile, the new CVS Pay won’t exactly launch as a standalone app but will be part of the already available CVS Pharmacy app. This payment feature adds up to the prescription pickup tools and loyalty program integrated into the app. CVS Pay works similarly with the same services from Android, Walmart, and Apple. Customers need to add their credit or debits cards to the system. A barcode will be shown and then be used to pay for the items and finally finish transaction after some verification measure which can be a signature or a passcode. The CVS Pharmacy app won’t be changed at all. It will only be updated with the addition of the CVS Pay feature. CVS Pay on the CVS Pharmacy app is now available in only a few markets like New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. More states are expected to receive the feature in the coming months or before 2016 ends. What’s good about CVS Pay is that it works on both Android and iOS versions of the CVS Pharmacy app. Credit and debit cards supported include Visa, Discover, MasterCard, and American Express.

Peter Allen Lewis, the Founder and President of Apple Ridge Farm, Inc., is retiring after 40 years of service, and his son, John Russell Faulkner Lewis, has been hired to step into the role of Executive Director. “The Board of Directors is ecstatic to have John transition into the role of Executive Director of Apple Ridge Farm,” said Melinda J. Payne, Board Chair. “With Peter as his mentor, John is sure to blaze new trails.” John Lewis comes to Apple Ridge with more than 17 years of experience working with inner-city youth in the public schools, community, outdoor education and recreational settings. He has served as a Certified Prevention and Health Education Specialist for the Virginia Department of Health in Richmond and Richmond Behavioral Health Authority, where he developed prevention and educational programs for at-risk youth. John is also the founder and former Executive Director of Renew Richmond, a nonprofit organization that promotes sustainable living practices, increased access to fresh, healthy produce and enhanced nutrition education in low-income communities. His work experience has been deeply rooted in organizations that focus on improving conditions for children living at or below the poverty level. John’s proclivity for helping the disadvantaged was established while he worked as a camp counselor and mentor at Apple Ridge Farm from 1999-2004. “I can’t begin to tell you what it means to me to be afforded this opportunity to lead Apple Ridge,” said John Lewis. “The organization would not be where it is today without Peter’s vision, devotion and organizational proficiency…. I learned from and continue to lead by his example.” Peter Lewis, who credits his mother for instilling in him a missionary spirit, moved to the Roanoke area from Washington, DC, in 1975. Soon after moving he purchased a 96-acre apple farm where the camp and conference center now resides. Like both of his parents, Peter was an educator for 34 years. He has worked as a teacher, physical education instructor, coach and was the co-founder, Assistant Principal and Principal of the first alternative education school for troubled students in Roanoke City, present day Noel C. Taylor Academy. He retired from Roanoke City Public Schools in June 2000. It is his belief in adults needing to take responsibility for guiding young people in a positive direction that led him to establish the camp. “Apple Ridge has given me so much joy,” he said. “I will always have a penchant for this place and I’m truly fortunate to have a son who is following in my footsteps.” A retirement party/fundraiser is being planned for Peter in November of this year.

This fall, however, we’re expecting to see a full-on Apple Watch upgrade. Ahead of that expected update, stock of existing models has been depleting gradually over recent weeks. As you’ll notice below, a variety of Apple Watch Sport models are currently listed as “Sold Out” on Apple’s website, though some do list scattered availability in retail locations. Even some nylon band options, which were just introduced earlier this year, are listed as sold out. For the stainless steel tier, all 38mm options are listed as in-stock and shipping on Apple’s website, but a handful of 42mm options are backordered 4-6 weeks, while the Milanese and Link Bracelet options are almost entirely liquidated. Finally, for the Hermès variants, almost all large sized bands are sold out, while a variety of other small/medium options are gone, as well. Hermès availability in-store is scattered, with a few stores here and there showing availability. At this point, it’s unlikely that Apple will go too far out of its way to replenish stock of any Apple Watch variants. Apple Watch 2 rumors have been picking up steam over recent months, with the device expected to feature faster internals, better waterproofing, GPS, and perhaps cellular connectivity. The Apple Watch lineup will likely be updated at a media event in early September, alongside the iPhone. As we told you all the way back in April, it’s not recommended to buy the original Apple Watch at this point, as the refresh is so close.

Although I preferred the minimalism of a wire-free desk, I reluctantly switched back to Apple’s old but still excellent Wired Keyboard to cut “low battery” notices in half, hoping that Apple would leverage 5+ years of Bluetooth and battery improvements to produce better wireless input accessories. Last week, Apple finally released sequels to its three major input devices: the new Magic Keyboard ($99) replaces the $69 Wireless Keyboard, the Magic Mouse 2 ($79) updates the $59 Magic Mouse, and the Magic Trackpad 2 ($129) vaults over the $69 Magic Trackpad. The signature improvement to each is the replacement of AA batteries with integrated Lithium-Ion rechargeable cells, refueled once per month with an included Lightning cable — previously only used for iPad, iPhone, and iPod accessories. Apple also tweaked each of the accessory designs, one more significantly than the others. Having given up mice five years ago (and radically improved a carpal tunnel-damaged wrist in the process), I opted not to test the Magic Mouse 2, but my colleague Dom Esposito discusses it and the other Magic accessories in the video below. My review is focused on the Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad 2, neither of which I’d call “must-have” accessories, though each has a couple of worthwhile assets, and at least one surprising Apple device compatibility limitation. Should you buy Apple’s latest accessories, or go with excellent third-party alternatives such as Logitech’s K811 Keyboard and Rechargeable Trackpad for Mac instead?… (Updated November 2015 and December 2015 with new battery testing results.) Key Details: Long-awaited accessory updates Trackpad 2 adds Force Touch Typically high manufacturing quality, clean designs Each is notably more expensive Rechargeable batteries are late in arriving, use Lightning cables for only decent 1-month power Check out Dom’s video review here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjoHBX7EkJU&feature=youtu.be] Given the growth of Bluetooth keyboards since the Wireless Keyboard debuted in 2007, Apple could have gone in a half-dozen directions with the Magic Keyboard — it could have added multi-device-compatibility and backlit keys like Logitech’s K811, stripped features to go ultra-thin and light, or kept a body as thick as the Wireless Keyboard but with far longer lasting batteries, just to name a few possibilities. Instead, the Magic Keyboard feels like more of a “shrug” of a design, doing just enough to be “better than before” without attempting to push the envelope in any particular way. The Magic Keyboard’s biggest advance over its 2007 predecessor is a built-in battery that can be refueled using an included Lightning cable. Plug the cable into your Mac and the Magic Keyboard into the cable, and the Mac will instantly pair the two together without requiring wireless configuration — a welcome but very minor trick that turns out to be the most “magic” you’ll find with this keyboard. The same trick works with the Magic Trackpad 2 (and the Magic Mouse 2), and all three promise the same one-month battery life on a complete charge, with the ability to run for an extended work session off a two-minute charge. A month of life between charges is short by modern Bluetooth keyboard standards, but based on my early testing, Apple may be understating the Magic Keyboard’s longevity (at least for some Macs).* Update: You can expect around 2.5 months of real-world use on a single charge; long-term testing took my Magic Keyboard from October 19 to December 31 before a “Keyboard Batteries Very Low” warning appeared. Perhaps not surprisingly, Magic Keyboard looks a lot like every Apple keyboard released over the past 8 years: silver aluminum top, matte white keys, glossy white plastic bottom and gray rubber feet. The box and Apple’s web site note that it “requires Bluetooth-enabled Mac with OS X 10.11 or later.” This requirement is fairly specific — note that the language omits “iPad,” “iPhone,” and “Apple TV” — but Apple doesn’t specify either the version of Bluetooth the Magic Keyboard is using, or a mandatory Bluetooth version required by your Mac. During testing, my Bluetooth 2.1 (late 2011) iMac and Bluetooth 4.0 2013 Retina MacBook Pro both paired without complaint; both were running OS X 10.11 El Capitan. If you were expecting the Magic Keyboard to be a lot smaller than the Apple Wireless Keyboard, sorry: they’re very close to one another in size. Still 11″ wide with the same six rows of keys as before — all in the same locations — the Magic Keyboard is now around 4.4″ deep rather than 5.1″ deep, and a hint over 0.3″ tall rather than just over 0.7″ tall, differences attributable to two things: the removal of the prior battery tube, and a noticeable reduction in key depth. Apple has made the F-key row full-height rather than half-height, and updated one icon to match current OS X functionality, but otherwise left the F-keys unchanged from how they’ve been for years. Left and right cursor keys have become full-height as well, mimicking a change some people groaned about in the 12″ Retina MacBook. I personally don’t care much about this change, and was glad that it was the only major modification to the key layout. Keys now hover around 1mm above the aluminum top frame, versus the Wireless Keyboard’s 2mm, a difference in travel that can be felt with every tap of input. If you love the decided “click” of a DAS Keyboard or Apple’s prior classics, Magic Keyboard takes another step away from that sort of pronounced “plunk” in the service of becoming slimmer and quieter. However, the new keys aren’t as soft or low-travel as the controversial ones in the 12″ Retina MacBook, making for a much faster adjustment period and — in my case — typo-free typing within a very short period of adjustment. So far, nothing I’ve mentioned qualifies as “magic,” and unless you think of a rechargeable battery in that way, you’ll struggle to find a justification for either the keyboard’s name or its price. Apple touts the keys, which now use the San Francisco font, as more precise than before, though the average user may well take a few days to reach the same conclusion. I agree with the claim, and have enjoyed typing on the Magic Keyboard 2, though it’s not a night-and-day difference relative to the other Apple and top third-party keyboards I’ve tested. There is one unusual and potentially show-stopping limitation of the Magic Keyboard: its compatibility with devices other than the Mac. How do you pair the Magic Keyboard with an Apple TV? An iPad? Maybe you don’t. The back of the Magic Keyboard has an on-off switch, a Lightning port in the center, and an antenna bar, but there’s no Bluetooth pairing button. Previously, the Wireless Keyboard’s power button could be held down to initiate pairing, but that’s no longer possible. And Apple’s instructions offer no guidance for iPad or Apple TV use: Magic Keyboard’s manual, packaging, and marketing are solely focused on the Mac. (Note: A reader points out that if you don’t pair the Magic Keyboard to a Mac, it will silently sit in a waiting to pair mode that can be seen by the old Apple TV and iOS devices. Apple does not appear to acknowledge this functionality on its own web site.) Logitech’s K811 topped my list of the best Mac and iPad keyboards earlier this year by offering great features such as great backlit keys, the ability to switch instantly between three different Bluetooth devices (say, Mac, iPad, and Apple TV), and a rechargeable cell with up to 1 year of power between charges. The only knock against it was its $100 price, which represented a $31 premium over Apple’s Wireless Keyboard — but with at least three functional advantages that earned that premium. Now that the K811 and Magic Keyboard are peer-priced, there’s little reason save a slightly smaller footprint to prefer Apple’s option. If I was shopping today, I’d almost certainly pick the K811 given its superior features and device compatibility. Manufacturer: Apple Price: $99 Compatibility: Mac with OS X 10.11 (or later) Magic Trackpad 2 With the Magic Keyboard (and Magic Mouse 2), what you see is what you get — there are no subtle frills or happy surprises to match or better options that have been available for years. But the Magic Trackpad 2 is a very different beast. It’s the starkest-looking Apple accessory design to date, taking the prize from the famously button-compromised third-generation iPod shuffle, and yet it’s also the most sophisticated standalone input device Apple has ever designed. I’m not going to tell you that I think it’s a must-have for trackpad fans — yet — but unlike the me-too Magic Keyboard, the Magic Trackpad 2 has a lot to admire under the hood. The biggest visual change from the Magic Trackpad to the Magic Trackpad 2 is the color of its top surface. Apple shifted from the clean all-silver glass and aluminum top of the Magic Trackpad to an edge-to-edge uninterrupted white glass surface for the Magic Trackpad 2. I strongly preferred the prior color, which was mimicked (and improved upon) by the full-glass top of Logitech’s Rechargeable Trackpad for Mac, as white looks increasingly foreign alongside black-and-silver Macs and MacBooks. But given the typical longevity of Apple’s wireless accessories, perhaps the Magic Trackpad 2 is signaling an upcoming trend in Apple industrial design. Measuring 6.3″ long by 4.5″ deep by just over 0.3″ tall, the Magic Trackpad 2 precisely matches the height and depth of the Magic Keyboard, and when they’re put right next to each other, the two Magic accessories are less than an inch wider than the Apple Wired Keyboard without anything else on its side. Like the Magic Keyboard, the Magic Trackpad 2 drops the rear AA battery tube to achieve a shallower profile, instead hiding its rechargeable cell in a glossy white plastic bottom compartment. But it’s actually 1.2″ wider than the original Magic Trackpad, which was already larger than the trackpad surface on any MacBook computer Apple has sold. My first reaction to the Magic Trackpad 2’s gigantic touch surface was that I didn’t need something so big — bigger than the iPhone 6 Plus — for cursor movement or gestures. Several days later, I still feel like it’s unnecessarily large, enough that my whole hand tends to rest on it rather than only the fingers needed for movement and gestures. But “unnecessary” doesn’t mean “unreasonably,” nor “uncomfortably,” as OS X’s touch recognition is sophisticated enough to recognize that a thumb or pinky now lingering on the trackpad’s edge is not there for pinch or other gestures. There’s a lot more going on with the Magic Trackpad 2 than meets the eye. For instance: the Magic Trackpad’s clickable buttons, hidden in the bottom two rubber feet, are gone. Instead, the “click” is mimicked perfectly using basic haptic feedback. Turn off the Magic Trackpad 2 and you cannot click it at all; turn it on and you can not only “click” normally with the anticipated feedback, but press harder to Force Click to a more pronounced level with deeper feedback. The mind-blowing moment is when you open System Preferences > Trackpad > Point & Click and choose “Silent Clicking.” Treble disappears from the click, leaving you with nothing more than the bass and a subtle vibration or two to signal input. After a not-too-extended period of time with the Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad 2, you’ll notice that your Mac is now even quieter than it was before (a goal of mine, as noted in my recent Make Your Mac Run Silent article). The Magic Trackpad 2 will be great for people who enjoy working quietly. I’ll be the first person to admit that paying $129 for a quieter, bigger version of the Magic Trackpad doesn’t make a lot of financial sense, as the last one wasn’t super loud or too small. Similarly, the current state of Force Touch/Force Click on the Mac is pretty underwhelming: deeply pressing the trackpad on a web link lets you open a preview version of the page in a floating window; selecting a word lets you check its definition in the dictionary; in some cases, hitting it on a fast forward/reverse button changes the rate from 2x to 60x based on the pressure you’re applying. OS X Preview’s signature feature can sense differences and using them to make ‘ink’ look thick or thin, as shown here, but like most of the Force features, this is a hidden trick that you need to hunt to discover. Even as someone who has looked forward to using Force Click features on the Mac, I can only describe them as forgettable at this point. One other oddity with the Magic Trackpad 2 is its Mac support. Unlike the Magic Keyboard, which one would reasonably have expected to use on non-Mac devices (only to be disappointed), the Magic Trackpad 2’s stated Mac-only compatibility isn’t a huge shock. But here, the requirement is for a “Bluetooth 4.0-enabled Mac with OS X 10.11 or later,” seemingly denying compatibility to most Macs sold before late 2012, even if they’re running OS X 10.11 El Capitan. I’m honestly not sure why Apple says this, as I was actually able to get a Magic Trackpad 2 to pair with my late 2011 Bluetooth 2.1 iMac without complaint, though I’m not sure whether battery life or pressure sensitivity data transmission work the same on older and newer Macs. Apple promises only a month of battery life between Trackpad 2 charges, but it’s already clear from the battery percentage indicators on my iMac that the Keyboard will last longer than the Trackpad 2 on a charge.* Updated November 2, 2015: After two full weeks of use with my mid-2011, non-Bluetooth 4 iMac, the Magic Keyboard shows 76% remaining battery, while the Magic Trackpad 2 shows 21%. I expect the Trackpad 2 will be out of juice after only three weeks, versus well over the promised month for the Magic Keyboard. Second Update: On November 5, the Magic Trackpad 2’s battery died mid-day, while the Magic Keyboard was at 71%. In other words, expect less than three weeks of Trackpad 2 battery life when not using Bluetooth 4, and easily two months of Keyboard run time. Third Update: On December 31, the Magic Keyboard displayed its first-ever “Keyboard Batteries Very Low” notification, hitting 2%. That’s nearly 2.5 months of battery life on a single charge. Who is the Magic Trackpad 2 really made for? The answer, as I discovered during testing and discussions with Dom Esposito, is “anyone looking for greater input precision.” Unlike the Magic Trackpad, where top-of-surface clicks rarely registered properly, every input from edge to edge registers properly on the Magic Trackpad 2. Having a larger surface can really help during video editing today, and there will unquestionably come a point (say, OS X 10.12) where many apps will take advantage of the added depth and pressure sensitivity of a surface like this. Calling the Magic Trackpad 2 a solution in search of problems isn’t quite right, but it’s certainly a tool that isn’t being properly exploited quite yet. The Magic Trackpad’s $129 price point isn’t really mainstream for an input device, and the Force Click/Force Touch hardware functionality it offers really needs more software support to be truly worthwhile. But unlike the Magic Keyboard, which could easily be replaced with (and bettered by) Logitech’s K811, the Magic Trackpad 2’s technology and design give it additional value — particularly the prospect of greater future value — that I wouldn’t write off. Even if you don’t want to buy it for yourself because of the price, consider putting it on your holiday wish list, because over time, you’re probably going to want to have access to the next generation of Mac input devices, and if history’s any indication, this may be the only accessory to offer it for the next 5 years.

PhilBoogie - 1 year ago Reply If the TP2 works just fine with BT2.1 I’ll get one tomorrow. At €149 I personally don’t think it’s expensive as it’s a great device. It will also keep clientele out of the Apple ecosystem that Apple doesn’t want to cater to in the first place. Thanks for a solid review Dom.

I do think they need to redesign the mouse as the edges are a little on the sharp side and become uncomfortable, and they should have put the connector at the butt of the mouse so we can still use it even while it’s being charged. I think they should figure out a way where spilling liquid on the keyboard won’t mess it up. I have resorted to using one of those silicone skins for my keyboards, which work pretty well if they are made precisely. I don’t know how much Jony Ive is involved with the design of Apple hardware anymore, he seems to be doing more and more publicity interviews than he used to. LikeLike Kevin A. Smith - 1 year ago Reply the charge port is on the centre back – it is not underneath – that would be plain silly design – and it can still be used while charging but it is expensive LikeLike Scott (@ScooterComputer) - 1 year ago Reply Good review, @Horwitz! I’m especially glad you pointed out and dinged Apple on the multi-device issue, and then specially mentioned the Logitech K811. This was the single feature I felt most compelling for Apple to add, and the biggest disappointment not to see. I mean, by using the name “Magic”, the ad copy could have written itself! “A keyboard that works with your iMac, AppleTV, AND iPad. All. Seamlessly. Like Magic!” And I also agree with your take on the Trackpad. I think it is definitely the evolutionary improvement that was expected…but the price jump is just a bit boo much to handle. I’m already having issues getting users to consider using a trackpad over a mouse; the added cost of “just try it” will definitely kill it for Windows switchers. And they seem to hate the Apple mouse too, and the new Mouse 2 won’t do anything to change that. I’d like to see some information about what Boot Camp features Apple has worked on with these devices, too, if any. With Win 10 going “all in” on gestures, how Apple’s devices work in Windows becomes a consideration (I have many clients who are running Mac hardware but booting Windows). The previous generation was wonky at best, the Mouse worst of all with its bizarre touch responses and complete lack of software control in Windows. The trackpad wasn’t Windows aware either, so it became nothing more than a basic input device. LikeLiked by 2 people griffinjar - 1 year ago Reply eject button? Eject what? No DVD drive!!!

But I’m disappointed by the Magic Keyboard, it looks great in my opinion (as does the MT2) but the lack of compatibility with non-Mac Apple products and no backlit keys put me off. The Logitech alternative has everything the MK should of been, even though I don’t like its styling…overall then another dull overtly evolutionary product from Apple. I wish they would pick up the rate of innovation that they used to possess. The competition seem to be speeding ahead. With the exception of the iPad Pro (which I really like!)

Don’t go with superior easy of use. LikeLike telecastle - 1 year ago Reply I disagree with a lot of conclusions made in this review. 1. Magic Trackpad 1st generation can be completely silent. It’s like most folks don’t even learn the new features that Apple comes out with. There is absolutely no reason to click on trackpads. Ever since I started using MackBooks in 2008, all gestures, including moving objects, selecting blocks of text, etc. can be performed without any clicks. Apple even went back and added this feature to 2007 MacBook Pros, which had a previous generation trackpads (with two physical buttons underneath the trackpad). So, when the reviews say that Magic Trackpad gen. 2 is much more quiet, I really don’t understand how anything can be more quiet than silent because my Magic Trackpad gen. 1 is completely silent. 2. I own two Logitech K811 keyboards. The Logitech keyboard has some issues. First, it does not last for a year on one charge. That’s a ridiculous statement. I used to use it in my daily work (with backlighting on), and I had to recharge it every two weeks. Secondly, the backlighting on it is dumb – it’s either always on or alway off. It does not have an ambient light sensor, which is annoying. Additionally, the quality of the key mechanism on the Logitech K811 is not as good as on the Apple’s wireless keyboard. The keys do feel differently and one could argue that the Logitech keys feel more solid, but I noticed that the Logitech K811 keyboard slows down my typing. It seems that the keys travel down and up slower on the Logitech K811 than they do on the Apple’s wireless keyboard. This would only be noticeable by very fast touch typists, so I guess I graduated into the higher league because I definitely notice it, and the difference for me is significant – I can type about 20% faster and more accurately on the Apple keyboard. That’s the reason I switched from the Logitech K811 to the Apple wireless keyboard after using the Logiteck keyboard for 2 years. 3. The author claims that he used to see the “low battery” notification for his Aplle’s Bluetooth Magic Trackpad and Apple wireless keyboard every other day. If this is not an exaggeration, I would recommend getting new rechargeable batteries. I have been using Apple’s rechargeable batteries that come with the Apple’s charger for years now. I use the Magic trackpad and Apple wireless (Bluetooth) keyboard every day, and I am a very heavy user. I have to replace batteries in the Magic Trackpad once every 2-3 weeks, and in the Apple’s wireless keyboard once every two months or so. The Apple’s charger comes with enough batteries to be able to rotate them among the keyboard, trackpad, and charger to always have two fully charged batteries on hand. The replacement of batteries is tool-less, and takes less than 30 seconds. LikeLiked by 2 people Jeremy Horwitz - 1 year ago Reply 1. “I really don’t understand how anything can be more quiet than silent…” A lot of people hate “tap to click.” It doesn’t provide feedback and, depending on how one uses a trackpad, can be less precise because lighter input is registered as a click. That’s why Magic Trackpad 2 provides options that feel like deliberate clicks but are close to silent. That’s also why Apple calls this “silent clicking” and differentiates it from “tap to click.” 2. Logitech markets the K811 as having up to a year of battery life. That said, it notes that the battery life drops dramatically if you keep the keys illuminated, hence your higher rate of depletion. And obviously, every wireless keyboard’s battery life depends on the number of hours of usage. 3. It’s not an exaggeration. Even with completely fresh batteries, the notification would come on after a week or so of use and then persist for 2-3 weeks before the power actually gave out. Once the batteries had been used for a while, I’d get the notification after a few days of use, and it would persist for 2 weeks before the batteries gave out. Using two Apple peripherals at the same time (Wireless Keyboard and Magic Trackpad), the low battery notification for one or the other would be on screen virtually every day. LikeLike o0smoothies0o - 1 year ago What?! Hahah um no. Apple’s new trackpad has haptic for clicks primarily for Force Touch input. I have always just tapped the trackpad too, which in my opinion is far and away superior, and I’d only click the new trackpad for force touch gestures. LikeLike Jeremy Horwitz - 1 year ago It’s great that you have an opinion that something is “far and away superior,” but a lot of people feel otherwise, which is why “Tap to click” is turned off by default. LikeLike telecastle - 1 year ago Jeremy, I use both the Apple Magic Trackpad and the Aple Wireless Keyboard every day for at least 8 hours a day 5’days a week in my line of work. If you are truly having these notifications every other day, something is wrong with your setup. I actually have two sets of these devices connected to two Macs right now, and the experience is very similar on both of them, with the second set being used by my wife (not as extensively as my setup). We’ve used these Apple devices with 2009 15″ MacBook Pro, late 2012 Mac Mini, mid 2014 15″ retina MacBook Pro, and late 2014 retina iMac. We have never had anything close to what you are describing. Magic Trackpad gen. 1 lasts for 2-6 weeks based on the intensity of its use, and Apple wireless keyboard lasts for 1-3 months. The low-battery notifications show up just a few days before the batteries die. As for the Logitech K811, I really think it’s a good product, but have you personally confirmed Logitech’s claim that it could be used for a year without a charge? There’s no way it’s possible. Finally, I love the device switching feature of the K811, but switching to OS X from the Logitech K811 is pretty slow – much slower than switching to Windows. Unless you work on two different computers side by side, this feature cannot really be utilized for anything noteworthy. People used to say they could text on an iPad using this keyboard and then switch to Mac on the same keyboard to do work. However, at this point you can text, iMessage, Facebook, and tweet from OS X, so using an iPad side by side with a Mac makes much more sense as a second monitor, via the Duet app, than as an autonomous computing device. Programming an Apple TV as one of the there devices into the Logitech is convenient, but unless you watch your TV in your office or live in a studio apartment, chances are you will use the traditional input method, using a remote (or a dedicated keyboard that you keep in your living room), rather than go to your office to get the Logitech K811 keyboard off your desk to use it with the Apple TV in the living room. LikeLiked by 1 person Jeremy Horwitz - 1 year ago @telecastle Up until I stopped using the Wireless Keyboard (approx. 6 months ago), I was using them both for around 9 hours a day, 5 days a week, plus some time on weekends. I’ve had a late 2011 iMac since late 2011 and previously used a 2009 or 2010 iMac. Not exactly an unusual setup. The low battery notifications have been persistent and annoying despite routine OS X upgrades, different batteries, etc. It was bad before the Apple Battery Charger was released, and continued after switching to the rechargeables in a predictable fashion (performance declining subtly after X recharges, with X being “way less than 50”). Is it possible that Apple revved the products after initial release? Yes. I bought the Trackpad the day it came out, have had the Wireless Keyboard a long time as well. They’ve both been on the market for what seems like ages compared with most Apple products. Re: the K811, I use it in a very different way with multiple devices than I did with the Apple Wireless Keyboard. If you’re asking whether I personally did a 1-year battery stress test on it, the answer is obviously no. No one does that. But I’ve used the K811 with three different devices at a time and typically found myself wanting to connect it to a micro-USB charging cable every four or five months, just out of habit. The value of the K811 as a switchable keyboard will obviously depend a lot on one’s personal setup. I keep it in a room where I have an Apple TV, a Mac mini, and an iPad that might at various times benefit from it. Switching the K811 between them is a matter of pressing one button and waiting 1-2 seconds. I wouldn’t call it slow, but maybe your setup is different from mine. It works wonderfully here, and the rechargeable battery has made it far easier to deal with than the Wireless Keyboard. LikeLiked by 1 person Steve Lawrence - 1 year ago I’m with Jeremy on point 3. I start getting ‘low power’ notifications for both my Magic Mouse and Apple Keyboard weeks and weeks (sometimes months) ahead of when they actually die.

LikeLike joachim barrum (@JoachimArt) - 1 year ago Reply I completely agree with the review. The prices are silly, completely silly! And it also seem like apple don’t really prioritise batteries the way they should. A keyboard of that size without even lit up keys should last a LOT longer than 1 month (I would say at least 3-4 months) which is what the replaceable battery version actually does. The mouse, I would prefer the old one. The idiotic charging outlet placement, the 1 month of battery time and completely the same design…I would say the previous one is a better product by far! The keyboard has no particular innovation, even if Apple say they do. I can understand the keys they added on the Macbook, with the short travel distance…It was made this way to get the laptop thin enough, but in a regular size desktop keyboard, I assume the experience is just different, not better in any particular way. And thats all the difference there is after all these years?!? Still eject button – even not a single new Mac has a cd drive and no lit keys or anything inventive or cool/useful new features at all… I also agree, the trackpad is the only new peripheral that is actually particularly better than the last one. the larger surface, the haptic feedback and look is an improvement. But the price on the other hand is pretty crazy in my opinion. And that is coming from a person who buys pretty much anything from apple – but Im not buying that one.

As a fellow Wireless Keyboard and Magic Trackpad user, I know for a fact that rechargable Duracell batteries used in each last an average of 2 months, for the keyboard sometimes up to 3 months, as usage is obviously far less than it is for the Trackpad, which is where most computer interaction is done these days. Even a set of cheaper 2100 mAh AA batteries offers 6 weeks – 2 months of energy. As for the popup reminders about low battery power, these only start when the device has 15% charge left. The reminders only increase to “daily” when the charge is closing in on the 5% mark. If a user has 6 batteries, ie. 3 sets of 2, he can easily recharge one set at his leisure and when battery energy in one of his devices becomes low, simply swap those out for the pre-charged ones. No big deal. As for these new, far more expensive devices, you have to use a cable and charge only lasts a month.

For me it’s the most useful when trying “pop” open link without actually going on that page to read or see a picture like on reddit. But for those that sees the price points as a big investment for computer peripherals then I will say that I just got the k380 keyboard and m535 mouse (with this free third party software called smooth mouse) from logitech and those are both also great, except for less than half the price. The keyboard pairs with 3 devices and both devices go for about 40 dollars retail (i got both for about 60 thanks to a coupon and sale at best buy) which is a big difference than 100 and 129 dollars.

But the numbers are improving every year, and a new report from Park Associates finds that more than 25 percent of U.S. smartphone owners use payment apps at least once a month. One of the biggest obstacles to more widespread adoption is that the market has been so fragmented that neither consumers nor retailers have been willing to commit to a single provider. However, it seems that leaders finally may be starting to emerge. More than three-quarters of retailers said last in a new National Retail Federation survey that they would start accepting Apple Pay by the end of next year, and nearly 60 percent said that they’d accept PayPal. Related: Are Apple's Glory Days Over? While Apple may be winning the hearts and minds of retailers, PayPal is the most popular mobile payment app among consumers. More than three times as many consumers use PayPal as use Apple, according Park Associates. It has gotten easier this year for retailers to start accepting mobile payments, since the terminals required to accept the new credit card chips generally can also take payment via near-field communication, the technology used by most mobile payment systems. Among the retailers surveyed by the NRF, 72 percent said that they would have the capability of accepting near-field communication payments next year, but just over two-thirds said they’d only accept one or very few types.

It is slated for a major redevelopment project that includes 2 million square feet of office space. August 8, 2016. Photo by Natalia Nazarova. / free articles read. Subscribe for unlimited access Read FAQ Like other North County communities, Cupertino is a city at a crossroads. Carried for years by explosive tech-sector growth, the city's employers have created about twice as many jobs as the city's housing inventory can support, meaning Cupertino is effectively outsourcing much of its residential needs to other areas. The imbalance is unlikely to end any time soon. Later this year, Apple's new "spaceship" headquarters will open for business, adding an estimated 14,500 new workers. And there's plenty more in the pipeline. A short walk from Apple's campus, the cavernous Vallco Shopping Mall is being pitched for a metamorphosis into a mixed-use district with shops, restaurants, housing, and a massive new office development. Up to 2 million square feet of office space has been provisionally approved by the city, which is expected to create 7,000 to 10,000 more jobs, depending on how you calculate it. Sitting inside a coffee shop on a recent morning, Cupertino resident Liang Chao sipped a cappuccino as she watched a logjam of traffic inching along Stevens Creek Boulevard, one block from Vallco. A former software engineer who is now a full-time political activist, she was sitting with a group of like-minded residents who are waging a campaign to slow down Cupertino's momentum for tech-fueled development, calling themselves Cupertino Residents for Sensible Zoning. While office expansion is providing a windfall for Cupertino's tax revenues, Chao and others described those gains as being outweighed by the long-term costs to the area's services, roads and quality of life. Unlike surrounding cities, Cupertino has no mass transit other than buses, so nearly all of the office workers streaming into town are being funneled into the same overcrowded roads. Saying yes to more offices is simply "crazy," Chao said. "Property taxes simply aren't enough to pay for all these costs," she said. "With every new office project we end up borrowing money from our future." Unlike the typical debates that swirl around development, this controversy is one that will be decided by voters in November. Chao's group has drafted a ballot measure that would force the Vallco project back to the drawing board and restrict what its members see as a City Council too eager to appease developers. Meanwhile, officials at Sand Hill Property, the firm behind the Vallco project, are taking their own countermeasure to the ballot, asking voters to approve the Vallco project as submitted. Cupertino is just one example of how the regional challenges and pressures of tech development, job growth and housing shortfalls are influencing a wave of local ballot measures across Silicon Valley cities. In Milpitas, voters will decide on an urban growth boundary to prevent housing development in the local hills. Farther south in Morgan Hill, residents are wary of being a bedroom community and are looking into a population cap that would last through 2035. And in Mountain View and several other cities across the Bay Area, residents are throwing support behind rent control as a way to prevent tenants from being priced out of town. Part 1 of the Voice's series "Out of Balance" examined the widening gap between job growth and housing construction in Santa Clara County and the impact on Silicon Valley's economy. Part 2 looked into the failure of nearly all cities to meet targets for low- and moderate-income housing development. The frustration caused by those two thorny issues is coming to fruition in the upcoming election. Leslye Corsiglia, executive director of the housing advocacy group SV@Home, said there's a clear groundswell of support by residents throughout the county to do something about the lack of available housing in the region. Local elected officials are following suit, approving higher housing impact fees for developers and finding new ways to finance affordable residential development projects. "People are becoming more aware of the need to act," she said. Spurring housing growth at the ballot box The November ballot is going to be packed this year, but housing advocates are zeroing in on one measure in particular -- Santa Clara County's proposed $950 million affordable housing bond -- as the big-ticket item that could provide relief in an overheated rental market. County officials say the money would go a long way toward easing demand for affordable housing in the region. A vast majority of the bond revenue -- over 80 percent -- would fund residential projects for extremely low- and low-income families, which is exactly the kind of development cities have failed to provide over the last decade, according to reports from the Association of Bay Area Governments. The spending plan for the bond measure, which the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors devised two months ago, is heavily weighted toward the most needy county residents. Of the $950 million, $700 million would help build homes for "extremely low-income" families (households of four people making less than $33,500 a year, for example), as well as permanent supportive housing and rapid rehousing projects that would accommodate some of the estimated 6,500 homeless people in the county. Of the remaining revenue, $200 million would be split evenly for homes for low- and middle-income households, and $50 million to help first-time home buyers. If passed, the housing bond would be an absolute boon for boosting affordable housing funds in the county, Corsiglia said, providing much-needed money for residential development for the county's homeless and low-income families. The bond proposal is coming from an unusual source -- it wasn't too long ago, Corsiglia said, that county officials said publicly that housing was not a core part of their vision. In recent years, the Board of Supervisors has doubled down on affordable housing and homelessness prevention efforts. "It would be a game-changer, particularly for homeless people," Corsiglia said. "There's no way that we're going to respond to our affordable housing needs without money -- it just won't happen." Estimates from the California Housing Partnership show that over 67,000 new homes would need to be built in order to meet the demand for low-income families renting in Santa Clara County. The need for more housing also coincides with rising home prices that reached a median level of $900,000 across the county over the past year, according to real estate analytics used by the county. At the same time, the county's Community Plan to End Homelessness found that it would need to build 3,600 supportive housing units to meet the needs of chronically homeless residents, as well as 2,400 rapid rehousing units aimed at providing short-term housing for people coming out of the foster care system and victims of domestic violence and human trafficking. County Supervisor Joe Simitian told the Voice that the housing would go a long way toward solving the county's homeless problem, and finally help the county make significant progress toward a "Housing First" solution to end homelessness. Projects to be funded, Simitian said, aren't geared toward workforce housing; instead, they could help as many as 4,000 of the most needy county residents. "This bond is essentially focused on the folks who really are at the lowest end of the ladder in terms of their income," Simitian said. "We were very explicit that those funds will be available to dedicate towards tackling homelessness." Simitian noted that there's a clear financial incentive to approve the bond measure. Homelessness costs an estimated $521 million each year in countywide services including criminal justice, health care and social services, which could be greatly reduced by housing and helping the county's neediest become self-sufficient, he said. "It's a little hard for folks to get squared away when they're worried about where they're going to put their head down at night," he said. The housing bond isn't the only thing on the ballot designed to address the region's growing pains. The Valley Transportation Authority is pitching a half-cent sales tax initiative to provide about $6.5 billion for transit improvements. Grassroots efforts for rent control While some ballot measures aim to increase housing, others are intended to stabilize the cost of living in existing homes. In response to skyrocketing rents and high levels of tenant displacement, residents in several Bay Area cities have put rent control measures on the ballot this November. Mountain View, San Mateo, Alameda, Burlingame and Richmond have measures on the ballot that propose some form of rent control. Community organizers have said there's a clear popular sentiment that more needs to be done to protect renters. Jennifer Martinez is the executive director of Faith in Action, formerly Peninsula Interfaith Action, and has helped spearhead the rent control measure in San Mateo. She said faith-based communities have traditionally been involved in efforts to support affordable housing and get out the vote in low-income and minority neighborhoods, but heading a campaign for rent control is a change of pace for Faith in Action. The rent control measure in San Mateo, which glided through the signature-gathering process, comes after four years and thousands of conversations with local residents about evictions and rent increases, Martinez said. In one instance, a family had totally paid off a building they were renting out to tenants, but decided to raise the rent by $1,200 a month in one fell swoop. Tenant advocacy quickly became the No. 1 issue, prompting a real change for Faith in Action. "It's not an isolated incident, it's not one building, it keeps happening again and again," Martinez said. "It became very clear that, though our organization has always supported building affordable housing, it isn't happening quickly enough to address the need." A poll conducted by Faith in Action earlier this year found that 72 percent of San Mateo residents and 68 percent of Mountain View residents support some kind of rent control measure, Martinez said. "I was surprised to see how many people said 'thank you, thank you for doing this,' and told us their stories about how they were evicted, or how they were afraid of being evicted," she said. A statewide override for affordable housing? Perhaps the most radical attempt to increase affordable housing in California is a bill proposed by Gov. Jerry Brown that would streamline the approval process of housing developments, making it much easier for developers to get the green light for new residential construction -- as long as affordable units are included. Proponents of this "by-right" housing bill say it will spur affordable housing development in cities that have traditionally blocked or delayed dense housing projects by allowing developers to sidestep the local approval process. The projects still have to be consistent with the general plan and local zoning and design review ordinances. The by-right housing proposal began as a trailer bill attached to this year's state budget, with an incentive of $400 million in affordable housing subsidies that were contingent on the bill passing. The budget has since been signed and adopted without the by-right housing bill, but Brown has continued to push hard for the policy in the current legislative session. The language of the trailer bill remains virtually unchanged. Brown's proposal comes after a report by the Legislative Analyst's Office concluded that the high cost of housing is caused, first and foremost, by the lack of housing to meet the demand. As of 2015, the average home in California cost $440,000 -- about two and a half times the average national home price -- and average monthly rent is 50 percent higher than the rest of the country, at $1,240, according to the report. Corsiglia said that SV@Home supports Brown's proposal, with a few amendments asking for greater affordability requirements and assurance that there would be community outreach. She said many cities in the Bay Area have zoned for housing and could support residential growth, but it isn't happening because of hurdles at the local level -- something that by-right housing seeks to fix. "If your housing element and your general plan says you can build housing in an area, you should be able to build it." Corsiglia said. The League of California Cities has come out strongly against the by-right housing bill, calling the governor's plan a misguided attempt to revitalize affordable housing development following Brown's own decision to dissolve redevelopment agencies in late 2011. Redevelopment agencies routed roughly $1 billion annually to affordable housing projects across the state prior to dissolution; that amounted to $65 million in Santa Clara County. City agencies aren't the only ones with a bone to pick. A statewide coalition of more than 60 organizations, including community development groups, tenant advocacy groups, faith-based organizations and unions, released a statement earlier this month slamming the governor's proposal. The coalition asserts that the bill will do nothing to truly address the housing crisis in California. Under the proposal, it says, a mostly market-rate development could avoid local review by having a small number of units reserved for affordable housing, and city governments would be unable to control a potential influx of high-cost units that could push out existing residents and further gentrify cities. "Policies that deregulate market-rate housing development have proven in all of California's major urban areas to cause displacement of lower-income communities," according to the coalition's statement. "High-priced housing developments are already destroying existing diverse neighborhoods, displacing residents, small businesses, and jobs." Concerns over initiative overuse In some cases, local elected officials have expressed concerns that making decisions on complex issues by popular vote is a poor way to craft policy. Mountain View officials have criticized the citizen rent-control initiative for being drafted as a charter amendment, which requires another ballot initiative to make any major policy changes. In the case of Cupertino, Councilman Rod Sinks said he was dismayed that both local activists and developers were using ballot initiatives to circumvent the normal government process on the Vallco project. He predicted both measures would fail. "Doing land-use planning at the ballot box is not smart, it's not wise. If anything needs to change with the Vallco process, then we have to go back to voters," he said. "I don't like this process -- you have a small group of people fiercely in favor or fiercely opposed, and then you have a huge pool in the middle." But many opponents of the Vallco project are well past the point of politely laying out their grievances at public meetings. Already, the citizens' group has filed a lawsuit against the city for allegedly mischaracterizing its initiative in the brief write-up that would appear on the ballot. Many members of the same group are also working to recall Cupertino Mayor Barry Chang, who is perceived as having too cozy a relationship with Sand Hill Property and other office developers. Sand Hill officials did not return calls seeking comment for this story.

Comments 13 people like this Posted by george drysdale a resident of another community on Aug 12, 2016 at 5:38 pm Here we go again, number one topic in a basic economics class: rent control. First of all one must be able to do basic math. There is no such thing as "affordable housing" only subsidized housing. With the cost of an average rental unit in Silicon Valley of around 700k (very high land prices) there won't be much "affordable housing" built. Because of the very high educational level and high incomes of Silicon Valley's residents prices have been bid up. Silicon Valley which now includes most of Bay Area is the Manhattan of the west coast. Government is the problem. Cynical politicians go along with what amounts to the mob rule of the renters who want "affordable housing (below market rents)." The key is to dense pack develop building more units per acre like what's happened in cities around the world throughout history. The problem is that Silicon Valley is the scientific capitol of the world attracting avid students of economics. Government is the problem when the politicians fail to even pass high school economics a required subject.

After all, who do you think is going to build new houses if they are going to be saddled with ever higher taxes and infrastructure costs, an inability to charge market rates for their rentals, and a political climate in which cities can impose costly restrictions on housing at any time? People voting for such measures don't have the interests of the community at heart, they simply want others to pay more so that they have to pay less. Of course. These initiatives will raise the cost of housing and make the housing shortage worse and perpetuate it. We shouldn't let these "advocates" or "coalitions" get away with pretending that they are doing this for "diversity" or the good of society; they are simply greedy and selfish. It is, of course, perfectly legal for people to pursue greedy and selfish goals at the ballot box, but we shouldn't let them get away with misrepresenting what they actually want.

Single family homes/condos/town homes are also exempt. I'm ok with a rent control measure, because it only applies to older construction apartments, who benefit hugely from Prop 13 while charging bleeding edge rents for dilapidated units. They hike rents aggressively and don't contribute to school funding, etc. Now, combine this with reduced regulations/permitting overhead, allow taller housing to be built IF it includes ground floor commercial units/grocery. We'll tackle the housing supply issues easily. If you really want to reduce long term rental prices, build lots of condos. Individuals dont have front desks that can hike rents and keep a steady flow of tenants renting. Real people will buy and live in the condo and eventually move in to something bigger. They'll either sell it to a new owner, or rent it out to someone at a more reasonable rate, hoping for long term occupancy.

Ms. Liang Chao has a good point about lack of transportation, but her group has not put forth a credible alternative to the proposed office development. They don't want to build more housing or more transit. Instead, their ballot measure mandates that Vallco remain a shopping center. A successful shopping center creates a lot of traffic. A shopping center that doesn't create a lot of traffic is a vacant white elephant like they already have. At that point, might as well just level the whole place and turn it into a park.

Those being built at 1101 El Camino are projected to be starting at 1.2 for a 2 bdrm & 1.1 for a 1 bdrm. The 4 or 5 "affordable units" are projected to be about 100K less, which still is a million dollars for 1 bdrm! And when the real prices are revealed upon completion, even the so-called affordable units will be much, much more than a million. No one is getting a condo for just over a million dollars. Case in point: "s9uQoMadera," nearby, was projected to be going to rent for $2500/mo. for a 2 bdrm, which actually started renting for $8000/mo. instead!

Charley Locke Culture Date of Publication: 08.12.16. 08.12.16 Time of Publication: 2:26 pm. 2:26 pm Hillary Clinton’s New Podcast Is All About Being Chill Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Hillary Clinton, Democratic presidential nominee, former Secretary of State, and renowned BlackBerry enthusiast, now has one more job to add to her resume: podcast host. Today, Clinton launched With Her, an official campaign podcast co-hosted by Max Linsky. In addition to Clinton and the Longform co-founder, the show will feature VP nominee Tim Kaine, Clinton supporters, and staff along the campaign trail. It will be released irregularly until election day. (The campaign has not responded to a request for comment from WIRED.) For Clinton, the intimacy of the podcast format provides a much-needed opportunity to be personable and casual with American voters. She is often criticized as being stilted and rehearsed. The podcast format encourages the opposite: off-the-cuff chattiness. And Clinton’s thrived in the intimate format before. In October 2015, Clinton appeared on BuzzFeed’s Another Round podcast, and on that episode the candidate often maligned for her lack of likability came across as at-ease, even funny. It’s clear from the first episode of With Her that the campaign hopes it will help portray the candidate as someone who an average American could commiserate with about waking up early or brag to about family photos. In it, Clinton and Linsky chat about her most emotional moments on the campaign trail and how she manages to be “on” all the time. The first thing she says is, “You can call me whatever you want, you can call me ‘Hillary,’ ‘Madam Secretary,’ you can call me ‘Hey You,’ you can call me whatever you want.” She shares that the last thing she thinks about her grandkids before she goes to sleep at night. The podcast also provides Clinton with a platform to have substantive conversations with the electorate about nuanced issues in a thoughtful, uninterrupted way. On Another Round, hosts Heben Nigatu and Tracy Clayton asked her tough questions about Black Lives Matter, reparations, and her experiences with sexism. Clinton fielded them honestly, and she came across as likable and authentic for it. Linsky is a pioneer of the sponsored content podcast: he hosted Brownscast, the insider podcast of the Cleveland Browns, and co-founded Pineapple Street Media in May to develop shows in partnership with organizations including The New York Times, Lena Dunham’s Lennyletter, and now the Clinton campaign. In the first episode of With Her, Linsky self-identifies as a Hillary supporter and a small business owner rather than a journalist, which informs the chatty, complimentary tone of their exchange. If it works, it will provide Clinton with something she sorely needs: a way to showcase her real personality—a thing her Republican counterpart has done so successfully on Twitter. Go Back to Top.

Bill Clinton is now officially the first man to enter a recipe into everyone’s favorite compulsory political bake-off, following in the footsteps of brave fictional hero Ben Wyatt from Parks and Recreation. Today, Bill submitted the Clinton Family Chocolate Chip Cookies into the Family Circle First Lady Cookie Contest, which for his sake, has been re-branded as the Presidential Cookie Poll. Bill’s cookies will go head-to-head with Melania Trump’s Star Cookies in a Facebook poll. You have until October 4 to cast your vote. As saccharine political theater goes, the cookie contest might make you even queasier than usual. Because holy retrograde gender roles, Batman. But in Bill Clinton’s case, it’s also scrumptiously ironic. The whole thing was cooked up as a way to make Hillary Clinton literally spend some time in the kitchen. Here’s the background: During Bill’s run for office in 1992, a reporter asked Hillary about her career choices and she said, “You know, I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession, which I entered before my husband was in public life. And I tried very, very hard to be as careful as possible, and that’s all that I can tell you.” Cue the outrage, from stay at home moms and pundits and, well, everyone. Family Circle Magazine responded by challenging Hillary to a bake-off, and she could hardly say no. And thus a weirdly compulsory cookie contest was born. For some people, having the likely First Dude strap on an apron seems like a victory. OMG BILL CLINTON SUBMITTED A COOKIE RECIPE TO FAMILY CIRCLE THIS IS IT THE PATRIARCHY IS COMING DOWN — Kate Stayman-London (@_ksl) August 18, 2016 Bill’s submission is being met with some outrage, too, though mostly not over the fact that the recipe isn’t Bill’s. (It’s the same recipe Hillary submitted in 1992 and 1996.) No, it’s because Bill is a noted vegan and many people apparently expected him to enter some butter-free, egg-free concoction. Although, honestly, Bill may be a vegan now, but he wasn’t always, and he knows vegan cookies do not a winning bake-off make. Would Bill Clinton's inevitably awful vegan southern fusion cookies trump Melania Trump’s? @jenwgilmore https://t.co/82gL3URezb — Room for Debate (@roomfordebate) July 28, 2016 Cookies for the First Gentleman: A Vegan Chickpea Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe for Bill Clinton https://t.co/IWTv0ZMyEw — Maximum Middle Age (@MaxMiddleAge) August 17, 2016 Clintons camp submitted a "Clinton family recipe" to Family Circles presidential cookie contest. I was hoping for Bill Clinton vegan cookies — Michelle Hackman (@MHackman) August 18, 2016 If you’re having deja-vu, it may because you watched this episode on NBC a few years ago. In the Pie-Mary episode, Parks and Rec writers fan-fictioned a better ending for the 1992 Clinton cookie kerfuffle. What they came up with looked a lot like today. In that episode, while Leslie Knope’s husband Ben Wyatt is running for office, Knope (sounding very Clinton-ish indeed) refuses to join the traditional pie-baking contest. NBC People get mad, and Wyatt ends up competing in Leslie’s place. Bill could have taken a few lessons from Ben—at least he found a way to make the Pie-Mary his own. NBC And to all the people out there saying it’s absurd for dudely Bill Clinton to have to participate in this pageant of domesticity (and they exist), we’ll let Knope take this one: NBC Go Back to Top.

TRUMP: It's time. I'm sick of that old grainy footage. RYAN: TRUMP: Admit it'd be cool to get a look at one! — Owen Ellickson (@onlxn) August 3, 2016 Since June, comedy writer Owen Ellickson (currently writing for NBC’s Superstore) has been imagining Donald Trump’s private conversations in dialogue form—and while mute sidekick Chris Christie, campaign manager Paul Manafort, and Hillary Clinton have all appeared in those conversations, Trump’s perfect comic foil has been Paul Ryan. You can probably imagine, then, what’s happened since Trump refused to endorse the Speaker of the House on Tuesday: Ellickson’s feed has gone from a funny lark to indispensable political satire. (Admit it: on some level, you always knew that Ryan was a Grimm fan.) To filter this in anyway is unjust, so just do yourself a favor and read it all the way through.

Black Friday 2016 TV Deals Frequent Flier Miles Are Kaput—The Game's About Credit Cards Now 3 Hillary Clinton’s social media team has (for better or worse—okay, mostly worse) already embraced emoji as a new method of political discourse. Now, a mobile messaging platform called Snaps is releasing an entire emoji keyboard dedicated to the Democratic frontrunner. It’s called (what else?) the HillMoji Keyboard, and it’s compatible with iMessage, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, KIK, Tango and other messaging apps on both iOS and Android. The keyboard comes fully equipped with Blackberry and sunglasses Hillary and Pantsuit Hillary; it even has GIFs and stickers. But no, says, Snaps founder Vivian Rosenthal, this is not an official campaign product. “The Clinton campaign is not officially involved in the keyboard,” says Rosenthal, adding that she spoke with Clinton’s team about it in advance. “As a female tech founder who’s a supporter of Hillary, I wanted to leverage our messaging platform to support her campaign.” Clinton’s attempt to start a conversation on student debt via emoji may have backfired, but that doesn’t necessarily make the HillMoji keyboard a bad idea. After all, emoji are quickly taking over the way we communicate, with Instagram recently finding that nearly half of all comments on the platform contain emoji. Go Back to Top.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 21, 2015 That Trump chose Twitter for this Q&A is fitting. He’s brilliant at Twitter. After all, Twitter has, to a large extent, enabled his campaign, giving the Donald a microphone from which to shout disparaging comments about his fellow candidates, the Democratic party, the media, and well, pretty much anyone else. In that way, Trump perfectly embodies Twitter’s problem with trolls: It’s easy for them to attract an audience and, once they get started, they’re almost impossible to stop. Then again, Twitter Q&A’s tend to bring out some trolls of their own. We’ll be watching to see whether Twitter gives Trump a taste of his own medicine. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Read Up During tonight’s Republican debate, Donald Trump shocked us all by speaking out against vaccinations…just kidding. That was totally what we expected him to do. Trump linked early childhood vaccinations with high rates of autism in the U.S., and told the story of an employee of his, whose child was recently diagnosed after getting vaccinated with, what Trump so delicately referred to as a needle that’s “meant for a horse, not for a child.” Trump says he has nothing against vaccines, but believes they should be administered in small doses over long periods of time. The only problem is: Science says Trump is flat-out wrong about the link between vaccinations and autism. Dr. Ben Carson tried in his own quiet way to assure the Republican frontrunner of this, saying, “The fact of the matter is we have extremely well documented proof that there’s no autism associated with vaccinations.” He also suggested Trump do some reading up on the subject. So, we made him a reading list. Happy reading, Donald: – Here’s a short history of vaccine panic. Quick read, we know you’re a busy man. – But if you happen to find yourself with some time on your hands, check out this 2009 story on how panicked parents skipping shots endangers us all. – There’s also a piece about the sickeningly low rates of vaccination at Silicon Valley day cares—and why that’s a problem. – What’s that you say? Hungry for more? Well, be sure not to miss this story, in which WIRED contributor and author of the book Neurotribes Steve Silberman discusses the increase in autism diagnoses, often referred to as the autism epidemic. In reality, Silberman says, the increase had to due with a broadening of the definition of autism, which led to a flood of new diagnoses. Hope that clears some things up. Go Back to Top.

Today, the activist investor said he has some strong opinions he’d like to share with the 2016 Presidential candidates—but of course he does. “I’m going to be doing a whole presentation about what I think about the debt and about the market,” Icahn told a group of reporters gathered at a press conference for Icahn’s portfolio company Lyft. The billionaire was light on details about his proposals, but he did admit to having a soft spot for Donald Trump. “I do think a lot of the things he says has to be done in this country or we’re going to have real problems,” he said. “We may have them anyway.” Icahn added that Trump “hit a very important nerve in this country.” “The argument he’s not a politician is in his favor, not against his favor,” Icahn said. But when asked whether he would accept the role of Secretary of Treasury, as Trump has suggested in the past, Icahn said he would decline: “I have my day job.” Go Back to Top.

Now, with a lot of help from interim CEO Jack Dorsey’s other company Square, it’s about to be worth a lot more. This morning, Twitter announced it’s teaming up with Square to allow Twitter users to make a donation directly through Twitter. The goal is to remove some of the friction would-be donors face, by putting a big blue “Contribute” button right in their Twitter feed. To sign up, campaigns must first create a Square Cash business account and email Square. This creates a so-called $Cashtag (essentially a username for Square Cash) that campaigns can Tweet out, automatically generating a Contribute button in user feeds. Twitter users who click the button will be able to input their donation amount, as well as personal information required by the FEC, like their names and addresses. Twitter For campaigns, constantly looking for more lightweight ways to attract new donors, this new tool could be powerful. Sure, users could always click a link and be redirected to the campaign’s donation page on their website, but containing the action within the app removes one additional barrier for people, particularly people who are accessing Twitter on mobile. Figuring out a way to make mobile donations more seamless has been a challenge for campaigns, ever since the FEC approved mobile donations via text back in 2012. That’s because the wireless carriers that enable these transactions often charge campaigns a percentage of the donation. By soliciting donations through Twitter, campaigns can circumvent the fees carriers charge, while still reaching donors where they’re increasingly spending their time: on their phones. As Jenna Golden, Twitter’s head of political advertising sales wrote in a blog post announcing the news, this is an effective way “for campaigns to execute tailored digital fundraising, in real time, on the platform where Americans are already talking about the 2016 election and the issues they are passionate about.” This move is not just significant for campaigns, but also of course for Square and Twitter, which Dorsey has been running side by side since taking over as interim-CEO of Twitter earlier this year. Despite recent calls for him to be chosen as the permanent CEO of Twitter, in June Twitter’s board made it fairly clear that they would allow that to happen if, and only if, he stepped down at Square.

In a lengthy post detailing his plans today, the former governor advocated for increased government surveillance, writing, “The National Security Agency and Cyber Command are on the front lines of defending the United States against cyberthreats. We must stop demonizing these quiet intelligence professionals and start giving them the tools they need.” But Bush is light on details as to what those tools would be. Insert much gnashing of teeth by American tech companies and privacy advocates here. In the post-Edward Snowden era, tech giants like Apple and Microsoft have become increasingly vocal about the need to protect user data from the prying eyes of the government. Meanwhile, privacy experts have panned proposed legislation like the CISA Security Bill, insisting that it creates too many surveillance loopholes for the government. Bush, on the other hand, argues in his new proposal that the President should push Senate Democrats who oppose the bill “to allow this bill to come to the Senate floor for a vote.” Bush is likely all too aware of the reaction these suggestions might receive from the tech world. That may explain why he also included a promise that seems out of place in a plan about cybersecurity: to “remove barriers to innovation in the tech industry.” This appears to be Bush’s way of softening the blow from the rest of his platform. Bush is far from alone in this approach to cybersecurity. During last month’s Republican debates, former HP CEO Carly Fiorina emphasized the importance of tearing down the so-called “cyberwalls” that tech companies put up to protect themselves from government requests for data. And new Jersey governor Chris Christie and Florida Senator Marco Rubio have also called for increased intelligence capabilities. For privacy concerned technologists in search of a conservative candidate, at least there’s always Rand Paul. Go Back to Top.

John McAfee Brian Finke Update: 9:19 am ET 09/09/2015 Several hours after this story was published, John McAfee filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run for President. He also launched an official campaign website. If you didn’t think the 2016 election season could get any more batshit crazy than it already is, now, John McAfee—the self-described “eccentric millionaire,” who founded the anti-virus software company McAfee, and who once played Russian roulette with a loaded gun while WIRED writer Joshua Davis stood by—says he is considering joining the 2016 presidential race. But first, he says he’s hoping to persuade someone who is “smarter and more charismatic” than he is to run with his backing. “I personally am still in a quandary about whether to run myself or find someone else for my party,” McAfee tells WIRED. “My advisors are pressing me to run.” McAfee, who won’t name his advisors or his prospects for stand-ins, says he’s been mulling a run for some time at the urging of his online followers. “I have many thousands of emails saying please run for President,” he says. “It’s not something I would just choose to do on my own.” But McAfee says he does believe the government is broken, largely because its leaders don’t understand technology as well as, well, he does. He points to the recent hacks of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and Homeland Security as proof. “Things like this cannot happen or should not happen,” he says. “It’s clear that the leadership of our country is illiterate on the fundamental technology that supports everything in life for us now, that is cyber science, our smartphones, our military hardware, our communications.” McAfee argues that the fact that the government is urging tech companies like Apple to create so-called “backdoors” into their systems that would allow the government to collect information on users is another sign that public servants just don’t get it. “That means allowing hackers easy access to anybody’s data,” he says. The prospect of a President John McAfee may sound absurd to you. If it doesn’t, please recall that McAfee was once arrested in Guatemala after fleeing Belize, where he was wanted for questioning by local police for the murder of his neighbor. No charges were brought against him in the murder case, but McAfee’s backstory is still a tad colorful for politics, even in the age of Trump. Yet the privacy arguments he’s making aren’t altogether unlike the ones that Apple and other tech companies have been lobbying for in Congress. Like Lawrence Lessig, the Harvard professor who is running for president to push an agenda for campaign finance reform, McAfee seems far more concerned with having his voice heard on one particular issue than with taking a seat in the Oval Office. Which may explain why McAfee is seeking a stand-in for his presidential run. He also said he didn’t want to discuss other elements of his platform until he, er, knows whether he or someone else is going to be candidate. That announcement should come within the next 48 hours, according to McAfee. As for whether Donald Trump’s surprising popularity had anything to do with his presidential ambitions, McAfee said, “I have great respect for the man but he has nothing to do with my decision to run.” Go Back to Top.

But it is pretty generic and, as far as logomarks go, not that adaptable. How on Earth will he ever get that banner on an app button for mobile? Here’s an idea, from astute design observer Matthew Gordon in Boulder, Colo.: why not just co-opt Obama’s campaign logo and make it his own? The Obama logo, designed before the 2008 campaign by Sol Sender, depicts a new sun rising over rolling hills—a symbol of new beginnings and American optimism. If you just flip it upside down and paint it orange, though, you have a symbol of Trump himself—wispy golden mane and all. Sure, it’s a narcissistic logo for a presidential campaign.

Hillary for America Today, there will be no throwback photos of Bill or selfies with Kim Kardashian gracing Hillary Clinton’s Instagram account. Instead, the presidential hopeful’s 238,000 followers will get a glimpse inside a day in the life of Texan native Rusean Pieternelle, who will be taking over Clinton’s Instagram account throughout the day. The Insta-stunt is meant to highlight the importance of Clinton’s so-called New College Compact, which aims to drive down the cost of higher education through, among other things, federal and state investment. According to a Clinton aide, “Pieternelle was chosen to operate the account because his experience coincides with Clinton’s focus on college affordability as a key part of her economic agenda.” Pieternelle is a father of two, who went back to school at the age of 30 to expand his career options. “It’s always a choice between getting the experience to move forward but taking a pay cut, or staying put to try to make enough and pay off debt,” Pieternelle writes in a post that will go up later today. Clinton’s college affordability plan includes a call for scholarships and child care for student parents like Pieternelle. This is just one of many examples of candidates experimenting with using Instagram in what is sure to be the most photographed election season in history. Earlier this week, Bobby Jindal began running political ads on the platform, and Instagram reports there are ads running from prospective candidates from both sides of the aisle, though it did not disclose who. But while this is Clinton’s first Instagram takeover, her campaign has handed over the keys to one of her social media account’s before. In May, a business owner named Mary Jo Brown took over Clinton’s Twitter feed for the day, as a way of highlighting Clinton’s small business platform. Hi there!

But a new report from a group that tracks ad spending shows that digital ads may soon play just as important a role for political campaigns. In 2016, political ad spending will reach a record high of $11.4 billion, 20 percent more than was spent back in 2012, according to Borrell Associates, a research firm. It’s a huge jump, but what’s more notable is just how that money will be spent. About $1 billion will be spent on digital media, a nearly 5,000 percent increase from the measly $22.25 million spent on digital ads back in 2008. And that’s only the beginning. According to the report, spending on digital media by the time of the 2020 presidential election cycle will explode to nearly $3.3 billion dollars. That will still trail the current $8.5 billion spent on broadcast television but not by nearly as much. More than half of the $1 billion budget in 2016 will be spent targeting social media sites, the report predicts. But even with such huge growth, these figures show just how far behind the political world is compared to the private sector. As the report notes, $1 billion is still roughly 9.5 percent of campaigns’ overall advertising budgets. In other industries, digital media often accounts for 30 to 50 percent of the money spent on ads. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. election 2016 online advertising Skip Social.

Melina Mara/The Washington Post/Getty Images Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton has agreed to hand over her private email server to the FBI for examination after government investigators claim that two emails that passed through it contained classified information. That info referenced satellite images and electronic communications, according to the Washington Post, and was reportedly found in emails originating from the CIA. Although the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency says the information was classified, a State Department spokesman disputed this, saying that the top-secret designation was merely a recommendation and that the CIA information had not been marked classified at the time the emails were distributed. What’s more, the official said, State Department staffers had “circulated these e-mails on unclassified systems in 2009 and 2011″ before some of them were forwarded to Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time. The public learned in March that Clinton had maintained a private email server from her New York home during her tenure as secretary of state throughout President Obama’s first term in office. “I saw it as a matter of convenience,” she said at the time. Because she couldn’t send personal emails on her government-issued phone, she set up the server using clintonemail.com as the domain to conduct personal correspondence. Clinton has been accused by Republican lawmakers of using the server to hide her activity as secretary and bypass public records requests. She resisted handing over the server in March saying that it contained personal correspondence with her husband, former President Bill Clinton. “I believe I have met all of my responsibilities, and the server will remain private,” she told reporters in March. She did, however, turn over two thumb drives to the State Department containing about 30,000 emails that she said held work-related information.

Jimi Celeste/Patrick McMullan/Sipa USA/AP Harvard Law School professor Larry Lessig has announced a pretty bonkers plan to extract big money from politics, and it might involve him running for president. You know, if no one better comes along. I've launched the committee to explore a run to be a referendum president. Read all about it: http://t.co/iXiScrVSpJ — Lessig (@lessig) August 11, 2015 By “referendum president,” Lessig means a president that runs on one issue and one issue only. In this case, the issue is campaign finance reform. Last year, Lessig launched a Super PAC called Mayday PAC that backed candidates who supported these reforms. Now, he’s taking that idea one step further. It’ll work like this: Lessig is asking the public to contribute to a crowdfunding campaign to end what Lessig calls a “rigged system.” If the campaign raises $1 million by Labor Day, and if none of the Democratic candidates agree to make campaign finance reform a core issue in their campaigns, then Lessig will run for president. If he wins, he promises to serve for as long as it takes to pass reforms, before handing the reigns over to his vice president. “No doubt, there should be someone better than me,” he says in the video—a phrase that has most certainly never been uttered in a presidential campaign announcement video. “This campaign is not about a person. It’s about a principle—an American principle that we must reclaim.” This campaign isn’t really about winning the presidency, either. Instead, it’s about bringing the issue of corporate involvement in government to the forefront. “Until it is fixed,” Lessig says, “no sensible reform is even possible.” Check out Lessig’s full video below: Go Back to Top.

But during the first Republican debate in Cleveland tonight, the candidates fought not about increasing the number of troops and tanks on the ground, but about how to enhance the country’s cyber security. It started off with Carly Fiorina—widely considered the winner of the night’s earlier debate for the lower-polling GOP contenders—calling for companies to tear down the so-called “cyberwalls” that prevent the government from accessing data from companies like Google and Apple. Fiorina argued that these barriers make it difficult for security agencies to “connect the dots” around potential risks. “I certainly support that we need to tear down cyberwalls,” Fiorina said, “not on a mass basis but on a targeted basis.” And while ISIS was certainly positioned as enemy No. 1 throughout the debate, candidates also discussed recent hacks allegedly carried out by Russia and China as a key threats to national security. During the second debate for the top ten contenders, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said these attacks amounted to acts of cyberwar. Meanwhile, the most talked-about moment of the night, according to Facebook’s data, was when New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul faced off over the issue of government surveillance. MUST WATCH! @RandPaul and @ChrisChristie get into a HEATED debate over the collection people’s records #GOPdebate https://t.co/doLjSdUKLH — FOX & Friends (@foxandfriends) August 7, 2015 While Paul stood his ground as a diehard opponent of government collection of public records, Christie said his experience as US Attorney of New Jersey in the aftermath of September 11th convinced him of the importance of surveillance. As president, Christie said he would push to provide even more tools to these agencies. No matter where the candidates stood, one thing was clear: cyber security is the new national security.

There was, however, one glimmer of hope: the forthcoming fake Chris Christie smooth jazz album. During an exchange with Sen. Rand Paul about bulk collection of phone records under the Patriot Act, the New Jersey governor defended himself against Paul’s comment that he gave President Obama “a big hug” by saying, “You know, Sen. Paul, the hugs that I remember are the ones I gave to the families who lost their people on Sept. 11.” Soon after the exchange, comedian Patton Oswalt asked the Internet to turn The Hugs that I Remember into a smooth jazz album.

There will be liveblogs. There will be thinkpieces. It’s the GOP debate tonight—and everyone on the Internet will have a whole lot to say. One more way to weigh in: The Washington Post is inviting anyone on the Internet to annotate the numbers, the zingers, the truths, and the lies that make their way onto the permanent record. The Post is working with Genius (formerly Rap Genius) to let readers annotate the running transcript of the debate published on the venerable newspaper’s site. Genius will provide the tech overlay that will allow anyone to highlight, annotate, and comment on the words of Trump, Bush, Cruz, and the debate’s seven other participants. “We’re hoping for a civil, constructive discussion,” Cory Haik, the Post’s executive director of emerging news products, says. The Post’s reporters will be adding their own fact-checking and commentary to the transcript, as well. Real Genius This isn’t the first time the Post has run transcripts alongside major political events. “They do really well for us, particularly on social and search traffic,” Haik says. But while in the past the Post has spent the night post-debate poring over the record, tonight they’ll do it in near real-time with the help of the crowd. “It’s cool to read the primary source with the added level of information,” says Ilan Zechory, Genius’ co-founder and president. As with the lyrics that Genius was first launched to annotate, commentators will be able to pull out the “hidden messages, meanings, lies, and exaggerations” that will saturate the debate, Zechory says. To be sure, the Post will be moderating annotations to ensure that they meet the site’s standards of decency. However, it’s up to Genius’ system to determine, which comments get shown and how. Zechory says Genius offers a kind of “upvote” system to highlight the best content when possibly thousands of users will be weighing in at wants. Genius also prioritizes verified users, such as Post reporters or politicians who might chime in. “As a political junkie,” Zechory says, “I’m excited to watch the carnival.” Go Back to Top.

But its latest political ad, which launched today, is just plain bizarre. It’s also completely genius … in an evil kind of way. Sponsored by an organization called Secure America Now, a conservative foreign policy nonprofit, the ad appears to users not as a video, but as a filter—the decals Snapchat users can slap on a photo or video before sending it. Framed by that filter, users are supposed to take a picture that reflects how they feel “about the bad Iran deal.” @PeterKoltak pic.twitter.com/rdfJop2Y4o — Mike (@thekevkoltak) August 6, 2015 Weird, right? Snapchat is full of kids and isn’t known as a hub of discussion on international relations. But the genius here is that the filter gives all those fresh-faced young ‘uns a reason to become the ad—and to spread it by broadcasting the message to their friends. Snapchat has been running other video campaign ads this election season, but the Iran deal ad is the first in filter form. It’s only available to users in Ohio in advance of tonight’s debate in Cleveland. And, according to Vincent Harris, the consultant who designed the campaign for Secure America Now, it’s already being used “more heavily than I even expected it to be.” “Snapchat is the primary source of information for a lot of younger voters,” Harris says. “So it’s the best way to actually educate younger voters about large issues like this.” Of course, not everyone is happy with Snapchat over what they perceive as the platform taking sides. That, or, you know, they just don’t care all that much about Iran. Hey snapchat, idgaf about the Bad Iran Deal — B-rad (@bradkeener82) August 6, 2015 (Translation.) Go Back to Top.

So Should the GOP If Facebook users—which is to say, most of us—had their way, the GOP candidates taking the stage during the debate tonight would have an honest and open conversation about race. And also, they’d all ride into Cleveland on winged unicorns. That type of discussion is, of course, unlikely, but according to new data released by Facebook today, race relations were the most talked-about political issue on the site during the period between May 29th and July 28th of this year. In second place was Mexico, followed by the economy, LGBT issues, and immigration. The rankings are based on how many posts, likes, shares, and comments these topics have received. Facebook, which is co-sponsoring the debates with Fox, provides the network with this data, but that doesn’t mean the moderators will adjust their questions accordingly. Still, they might be wise to. With hundreds of millions of daily active users in the US, Facebook has become a new barometer of public sentiment. And while the Republican candidates have been more than willing to share their thoughts on marriage equality, the economy, and immigration, race is one topic that—with a few exceptions—they’ve skirted almost entirely. It’s no wonder, then, that a discussion on race is precisely what the public craves. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. election 2016 race Republican debate Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

Joe Raedle/Getty Images Airbnb pushed into Cuba back in April, shortly after President Obama announced the start of normalized relations with the Latin American country. And now, Hillary Clinton wants other tech companies to follow. Today, during a speech at Miami’s Florida International University, the former Secretary of State made a case for ending the long-standing embargo with Cuba, arguing that by isolating the country, America is “strengthening the Castro’s grip on power, rather than weakening it.” And she made it clear that the Internet, and tech companies at large, have an important role to play in ending that isolation. As Clinton noted, only about 5 percent of Cubans have access to the open Internet. “We should make it clear, as I did as Secretary of State, that the freedom to connect is a basic human right, and therefore do more to extend that freedom to more and more Cubans,” Clinton said. She called on businesses to build joint ventures with Cuban companies and find ways to expand operations there. “I’m told that Airbnb is already getting started,” Clinton said, noting that Google and Twitter “are exploring opportunities, as well.” Go Back to Top.

Illegal. No ifs, ands, or buts about it,” he said. In New Hampshire, this stance was met with a round of applause. But fear not, tokers. Given the growing support of recreational and medical marijuana throughout the U.S., these threats aren’t likely to give the New Jersey Governor’s already weak polling numbers a boost.

Needed a quick explainer on this #Sharknado3 thing @mcuban http://t.co/MfXqQBelbw — Jeb Bush (@JebBush) July 24, 2015 In a new video, released by his campaign as part of a series called #JebNoFilter, the Republican candidate describes turning on the TV in his hotel to find a shark-infested world in which Ann Coulter plays Vice President to Mark Cuban’s President. “And then I find out, this is the third version of this,” Bush says in a video that appears to have been recorded on a smartphone. “Please help me. Give me some information on what’s going on. I’m culturally illiterate, apparently.” We know just how you feel, Jeb. And that’s the point. This clever campaign move is what we like to call the Mitt effect. It’s pretty widely agreed that Mitt Romney was never more likable than he was in the post-election Netflix documentary Mitt, which captured the Republican candidate when he wasn’t just shaking hands and kissing babies. For Romney, though, it was too late. Now, the Republican party is loading up on the #nofilter moments early. A bit corny, yes, but bless their little hearts for trying. Go Back to Top.

In a Facebook Q&A later in the day, the Democratic candidate responded to McConnell’s comment, arguing, “There is a gender card being played in this campaign. It’s played every time Republicans vote against giving women equal pay, deny families access to affordable child care or family leave, refuse to let women make decisions about their health or have access to free contraception. These aren’t just women’s issues, they are economic issues that drive growth and affect all Americans.” Clinton’s savvy social media team then took that idea one step further, tweeting out a picture of a card that delineates all of those policy changes, accompanied by a new hashtag: #gendercard. If Sen. McConnell thinks fighting for women and families is playing the "gender card"—okay.

That unemployment rate is especially high among young black and Hispanic people. Training plays a role in helping people secure those jobs, but Clinton said we must also ensure that even as technology eliminates the need for some jobs, there are enough new ones to take their place. “The best antipoverty program is a job, but that’s hard to say if there aren’t enough jobs for people to help lift themselves out of poverty,” Clinton said. To increase the number of available jobs, the former Secretary of State laid out a plan to offer businesses $1,500 in tax credits for every employee they hire and train. Go Back to Top.

That was Hillary Clinton’s message to supporters in a speech on economic policy today in New York City. Clinton described a movement of women into the workforce that has effectively stalled in recent years. In the past, she noted, the United States ranked 7th among 24 country in terms of the number of women in the workforce. By 2014, however, the U.S. had dropped to 19th. “We can’t afford to leave talent on the sidelines, but thats exactly what we’re doing today,” she said. “We not only shortchange [women] and their dreams, but we shortchange our country and our future.” Clinton attributed this decline to the fact that other countries have adopted policies to support working mothers, like affordable child care and paid family leave. This was not the first time Clinton has argued for these family friendly policies as economic drivers, and as her campaign continues, you can be fairly confident it won’t be the last. Clinton also decried the “outrage” of women, particularly women of color, making substantially less than their male counterparts in the same jobs. “For far too long these challenges have been dismissed by some as women’s issues,” Clinton said. “Well, those days are over.” Go Back to Top.

Andrew Burton/Getty Images Add Hillary Clinton to the list of labor advocates coming after the gig economy. In her first major speech outlining her economic platform today at New York City’s New School, the Democratic presidential candidate vowed to crack down on “bosses misclassifying workers as contractors.” The promise follows a wave of legal action that’s been taken against companies like Uber recently, which argue that drivers should be compensated as employees. Clinton, who emphasized the need to raise wages throughout her speech, said that businesses that allow people to make extra money by renting a spare room or driving their own car can often threaten solid labor practices. “This on demand or so-called gig economy is creating exciting opportunities and unleashing innovation,” she said, “but it’s also raising hard questions about workplace protection and what a good job will look like in the future.” Go Back to Top.

By Brooke Crothers Published August 12, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print Customers stand in line at the Apple store in Berlin, as they wait to buy the newly released iPhone 6 September 19, 2014.  (REUTERS/Hannibal ) While the upcoming iPhone 7 is expected to have some welcome improvements, the iPhone that Apple is planning for 2017 could be really different. First, let’s review what’s expected for the iPhone 7. Two recent reports from Bloomberg lay out a lot of the details. It’s expected to debut at an Apple event less than a month from now on September 7, but be physically similar to the iPhone 6/6s, a design first introduced in September of 2014. That means Apple will break from its past practice of doing a physical makeover every two years. The iPhone 7’s improvements and changes are expected to include a dual-camera system (possibly similar to Huawei’s P9 smartphone) on one model, a redesigned pressure-sensitive home button, and no headphone jack. Headphones would be connected via the charging port or Bluetooth. Wait for the iPhone 8? The iPhone 8 should be the device that moves Apple into the future. It may not be a coincidence that 2017 will be the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. So, it's conceivable that Apple is waiting for that date to bring out an overhauled iPhone. So far, speculation points to a 2017 iPhone that could be based on a glass body, according to a report this week from Nikkei, Japan’s largest business newspaper. “Apple is expected to redesign the iPhone, including giving it a glass chassis,” Nikkei reported. That glass casing could be made by Apple manufacturing partner Foxconn, Nikkei said, citing a source with knowledge of Apple component suppliers in Taiwan. "Foxconn has been trying [to develop a] glass chassis since last year," Nikkei quoted the source as saying. Related: Is the iPad Pro the future of laptops? Apple thinks so 'iPhone 7' rumor roundup: Better camera, no headphone jack? I've used Apple Watch for one year. Here's what I think But probably the most stunning part of the redesign would be the rumored move from the current LCD (liquid crystal) display to an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display, which is a rumor repeated by Nikkei. That would theoretically enable Apple to revamp the iPhone’s physical look-and-feel and— as one possibility— offer a curved display with higher resolution and more vibrant colors. A major redesign along those lines is practically necessary for Apple because Samsung already offers the highly-praised Galaxy S7 Edge with an OLED display that's curved along the two lengthwise edges of the phone. That gives Samsung a clear technological advantage over Apple. “Right now, the Galaxy Note 7 is far more advanced than what Apple offers and, my bet, more advanced than what the iPhone 7 will offer,” Todd Haselton, a writer for tech media site TechoBuffalo, told Foxnews.com in an email. “Several rumors have suggested Apple is moving toward an OLED display next year, which will be a good first step [toward closing the gap],” he added. Apple could also combine hardware improvements with new software and services, Rushabh Doshi, an analyst with market researcher Canalys, told FoxNews.com. "We expect Apple to focus strongly on service innovation. Artificial Intelligence would take center stage in the coming years as the smart phone becomes a true ‘assistant’ to the user," Doshi said. "[The] recent acquisition of Turi continues to underline the importance of AI for Apple," Doshi said. Neither Apple nor Foxconn would comment on the Nikkei report.

 Apple's pricey data center finally gets the green light Sam Shead Aug. 12, 2016, 11:36 AM 4,087 facebook linkedin twitter email print A computer generated image of Apple's data centre. Apple Apple has been given the green light to build the first data hall for a huge new data center on a 197-hectare site near the west coast of Ireland. Irish planning body An Bord Pleanála gave Apple's first data hall the go ahead on Wednesday despite opposition from a number of individuals and local businesses. The planning body said the data center will provide the area with a significant economic boost, adding that they took into account how hard it is to find sites that are able to accommodate huge data centers that need to be connected to the national grid. Apple has received planning permission to build just one data hall but it hopes to build a total of eight on the site over the next 10-15 years. The iPhone maker will have to apply for planning permission every time it wants to open a new data hall. The facility will be built in the middle of a forest just outside the small town of Athenry in County Galway. It will initially consist of a single data hall, an administration building, and other associated developments. Over 200 people will be employed in the building of the data center, while a significantly smaller number of IT workers and data center technicians will operate the facility when it's built. The data center — which Apple says will be totally powered by renewable energy — will be built on land that state forestry company Coillte used for growing and harvesting non-native trees. Apple plans to restore native trees to Derrydonnell Forest and create an outdoor education space for local schools, as well as a walking trail for the community. Apple Maps/Skitch/Sam Shead Apple's Irish data center plans were approved last September by Galway County Council but they were held up after a number of appeals were made to An Bord Pleanála. Appellants raised concerns over the impact on the local wildlife, the data center's energy usage, and flooding, among other things. Apple wants to use the data center to store European user data and to help power online services including the iTunes Store, the App Store, iMessage, Maps, and Siri for customers across Europe, according to a press release announcing the development in February 2015. The Cupertino company was hoping to have the facility up and running by early 2017 but that target date now looks unrealistic given Apple is yet to start any building work. Some 5,500 of Apple's 18,300 European staff are based in Ireland, which is also home to its European headquarters. The company has pledged to hire an additional 1,000 staff in Ireland before 2017. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have also built data centers in Ireland, and Facebook also has one planned. Elsewhere in Europe, Apple is planning to build a data center in Denmark on the same scale as the one in Ireland. The company does not reveal where all of its data centers are but reports suggest Apple also has data center facilities in Newark, Santa Clara, and Cupertino on the west coast of the US, as well one in Maiden on the east coast. Business Insider contacted Apple about the data center completion date but did not immediately hear back.

But why now? Credit Photograph by Robin Beckham / BEEPstock / Alamy Ads can seem like the bane of the Internet. They take up real estate and slow Web pages while they load; at worst, they splash across the screen for interminable seconds, shout loudly and unexpectedly from an invisible corner, or surreptitiously infest the host computer with malware. Around two hundred million users worldwide have tools to block these ads and prevent them from loading, according to reports from the ad-blocking-circumvention startup PageFair. Blocking ads, however, also keeps the Web sites you read from making money. And so, typically, sites try to earn back this business with appeals to visitors’ empathy: they ask you to please “white-list” the site and let it stay in business. Other sites go so far as to block their content entirely when they detect that an ad-blocking tool has been enabled. Sites including Wired, GQ, and Forbes have used one or more of these strategies to re-monetize readers who were blocking ads. (If you use an ad blocker while visiting newyorker.com, the slots usually filled by ads will contain messages encouraging you to subscribe, which my editors suggest you should do.) It should be noted that ad blockers do nothing to guard against—and perhaps even encourage—other forms of advertising, such as “sponsored content”—articles, photos, or videos that look similar to a given Web site’s content, but are commissioned by advertisers. On Tuesday, Facebook, which has 1.7 billion users, announced that it’s taking this battle even further, in a way that only it can: with the latest version of its Web site, at least on desktop computers, Facebook cheekily defangs blockers entirely and serves its ads exactly where they would have been blocked. The Times claims that Facebook’s site changes will make it much more difficult for ad-blocking tools to identify ads, and that re-blocking them after they’ve been re-served would require a resource-intensive analysis of the ads themselves. Wired noted that makers of the ad-blocking tools are already at work on a counterattack. (Facebook reported that it rolled out the changes on Tuesday, but at the time of this writing, Adblock Plus was still able to eliminate both sidebar ads and sponsored posts in the news feed. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the new version of its site has fully rolled out yet.) Facebook has a strong incentive to end ad blocking; it makes money on ad revenue. In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company noted that ad blockers posed a significant threat to its business. Neutering the blockers would mean protecting its top line. But ad-blocking software has been available for quite some time. The question remains: Why has the backlash cropped up now? To understand Facebook’s motivation, it helps to revisit Apple’s mobile ad blockers, which the company introduced last year. Apple’s mobile ad blockers, which have earned a lot of attention, work only on Safari’s mobile browser. But Apple’s entire mobile platform is built on closed-system apps, not Web-based sites. Ads served within these apps cannot be blocked by anything, not even Apple’s own ad blockers. So, by blocking Web-based ads, Apple’s move would, in theory, drive businesses away from the open mobile Web, where the future of advertising is shaky, and toward apps, where there are fewer business variables. It’s not a coincidence, either, that Apple makes money from apps through both sales and advertising, while it earns nothing from its mobile browser. What was true of Apple then is even more true of Facebook now. Over the last few years, Facebook has seen rapid growth within its mobile app, where blockers don’t work and it can easily control the ad experience in the same way that Apple can control the app experience. This means that features of advertising that frustrate readers are gone (malware, surprise screen takeovers, unexpected noise), but some of it is still very much there (tracking, data collection). Facebook has now shut down ad blockers on nearly all of its domain—first on mobile apps and now on desktops. (Blocking still works on the mobile Web.) This suggests to publishers that Facebook is a safe space where the business of content can be more effectively protected, on the condition that they submit to being Facebook’s vassals. Individual publications, and even some publishers, lack the resources to mount an all-out arms race against ad blockers, not least because they’re unlikely to attract engineering talent when there are so many startups and established tech companies plying potential hires with equity—or at least free meals. Facebook’s ability to protect its revenue stream on the desktop version of its site only strengthens its position as a closed platform, a place where the user is powerless against its technical domination and will be gently served ads, whether they like it or not. This makes it an extremely safe bet as a place for brands to publish content. Instant Articles, while not yet a success, got a deluge of publishers on board because the model seemed straightforward, reliable, and immune to ad-block tampering. It helps that Facebook gives a good home to sponsored placements within its news feed. Publishers are safe there, sort of, for now, although they are also subject to Facebook’s semi-yearly whims, which vacillate between favoring the latest Facebook product (embedded links, videos, news, live streams) and the posts of users’ closest friends and family, as determined by its algorithms. Facebook is still only one platform, but its cavalier attitude suggests the détente between ad blockers and Web properties is coming to an end.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Editorials Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Editorials Sat, Aug 13, 2016 - Page 9　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Once taunted by Jobs, companies are now big Apple customers Apple’s former rival IBM has become one of its biggest boosters, developing more than 100 business-oriented apps using Apple’s iOS that it has sold to about 2,000 companies By Vindu Goel  /  NY Times News Service, SAN FRANCISCO Illustration: Kevin Sheu In the primordial days of computing, IBM machines were so common inside corporations that there was a running joke in the industry: Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM. These days, the same could be said about Apple. Even IBM is promoting Apple gear. Apple’s iPhones and iPads have become the preferred mobile computing devices for corporations, as industries from insurers to airlines aim to ditch bulky PCs and give their employees the ability to do their jobs from anywhere using smartphones or tablets. For Apple, which is struggling to reverse declining sales of its iPhones and Macs and has seen overall revenues drop for two quarters in a row, the corporate market is a surprising bright spot. Sales of high-end iPads to business customers in particular have been strong. About half of all iPads are now bought by corporations and governments, according to the research firm Forrester. “Apple is stronger in the enterprise market with its devices than it is with consumers,” said Frank Gillett, an industry analyst at Forrester. It is a long way from the days when Steve Jobs, Apple’s cofounder and longtime chief executive, derided corporate technology buyers as “orifices” and preferred to focus on building great products that would sell themselves. Pinpointing exact figures for Apple’s corporate sales is difficult. Apple said growth was strong, but declined to disclose recent numbers. During its last fiscal year, which ended in September last year, Apple said it sold US$25 billion in products and services to companies and other large customers. While that was only about 11 percent of the company’s overall revenue, those business sales were up 40 percent from the previous year. That is compared with 28 percent growth for the entire business. Companies are turning to Apple’s products for their tight-knit hardware and software, advanced security features and intuitive interfaces. Aiding Apple’s corporate sales has been a concern that phones and tablets running Google’s Android software, which are generally cheaper and popular with consumers, have lagged in the security technology and the standardization that companies want. For British Airways, which has built more than 40 custom iPad apps for its workforce, switching to tablets has eliminated reams of paper used for flight plans, passenger manifests and maintenance records. Another app allows anyone at the airline to grab an iPad and quickly rebook passengers when a flight is canceled or weather wreaks havoc on schedules. “We can get to customers wherever they are,” said Abigail Comber, who is in charge of the customer experience at the airline. “It’s technology that’s very intuitive. What the team has managed to do brilliantly is take away everything that happens on the back end.” The carrier has so far deployed its apps across 17,000 iPads, and is looking to digitize even more of its business. Apple said it is focused on creating great devices — for all customers. “We’re dedicated to building products that make people’s lives better, often in ways that we couldn’t have even imagined, enabling them to do things that they have never done before,” Susan Prescott, vice president of worldwide product marketing, markets and applications, said in a statement. “Our goal with business customers is the same — to enable them to do something great with mobile and truly modernize and transform their business.” 1 2 3 NEXT › This story has been viewed 2203 times.

Photo: CNA Quanta Computer Inc (廣達) expects its business in the second half of this year to outpace the first half, supported by the upcoming launch of new wearable devices and notebook computers for a major US client, company executives said yesterday. “The client is ready to launch their new products... Performance in the second half is expected to grow from the first half,” Quanta chairman Barry Lam (林百里) told a news conference ahead of an investors’ conference. Quanta, the world’s largest contract notebook maker, is the main supplier for Apple Inc’s MacBooks and the sole supplier for its Apple Watch. It is widely speculated that Apple will introduce its new smartwatch and notebook devices this fall. Quanta vice chairman C.C. Leung (梁次震) said seasonal demand would also help boost shipments of Quanta products in the second half, despite uncertainties in the global economy, with notebook shipments likely to expand 10 percent from 19 million units in the first half. Xiaomi Corp (小米) has also joined the notebook market, adding more pressure on existing players, but Leung said he expects a limited impact on Quanta as Xiaomi mainly focuses on the Chinese market. However, the sharp appreciation of the New Taiwan dollar against the US dollar this quarter pressured the company’s operations, Leung said, adding that the firm will do its best to hedge foreign exchange risks. Quanta’s net income rose 3.8 percent from NT$3.37 billion (US$107.31 million) a year ago to NT$3.5 billion last quarter. The figure indicates a quarterly decline of 3.2 percent due to seasonal factors, the company said. Gross margin reached 5.24 percent, up from last year’s 4.37 percent and the prior quarter’s 4.98 percent, marking the company’s highest gross margin since the third quarter of 2009, according to Quanta’s filings with the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Operating margin improved by 0.22 percentage points both annually and quarterly to 2 percent last quarter, company data showed. In the first half of this year, Quanta’s combined net income totaled NT$7.11 billion, up slightly by 1 percent from last year’s NT$7.04 billion. This story has been viewed 1422 times.

The unit is Apple MFi Approved and has a slot that takes standard Micro SD Memory cards. Traditionally Apple MFi approved iFlashDrives have only had internal memory, with an Apple Lightning adapter on one side and a standard USB adapter on the other. The i-FlashDrive CR8600, has an Apple Lightning adapter and a standard Micro SD Card can slide into it. Gigastone President Michel Hassan says one big advantage is that data residing on a Micro SD Card can easily be accessed from an iPhone or iPad without having to copy the data onto the iPhone. Photos, videos and music files, usually too large to store on an iDevice, can easily be viewed or accessed using the Gigastone CR8600 iPhone Flash Drive Micro SD Card Reader, he adds.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Microsoft Is Most Innovative Place To Work Says Study Posted: Aug 12 2016, 9:58am CDT | by IANS, in News | Latest Business News   Photo Credit: Getty Images   Microsoft's employees are more innovative than Apple's, and Facebook's staff are less creative than most tech workers, says a study led by Indian-origin entrepreneur. Don't Miss: Sam's Club Black Friday 2016 Deals The findings showed that Facebook lags behind the others in cultivating a culture of creativity. Microsoft employees are more innovative than those at Apple. "The study data tell us that in terms of adventurousness, Microsoft employees tend to be neck-and-neck with Apple's, and much more adventurous than Google, Facebook, or IBM employees," Samar Birwadker, Founder and CEO of Good&CO, was quoted as saying to fastcompany.com on Friday. As a result of being among the first social media platforms on the Internet, Facebook may be considered among the most innovative companies in the world. However, its early successes have resulted in a more conservative effort to sustain them. "They have (Facebook) always had that reputation [of being innovative], and I think that now becomes a subconscious thing, that Facebook is innovative, but the current place they are in as a business doesn't require them to personally be innovative," Birwadker said. "They (Facebook) invented social networks, and there's always been this layer of innovation," Birwadker explained adding, "but with more pressure on revenue, and especially on mobile and advertisements, I think we are seeing a lot less risk taking and adventurousness by their employees." On the other hand, Microsoft is often perceived as less innovative, because the more established tech giant has lagged behind the growth of its competitors. Microsoft has always made a lot of money doing things the right, traditional, organized way, the study said. "But with the success of social platforms and companies like Google Microsoft realized that they need to focus on consumer first, whereas they have always been B2B," Birwadker stated, pointing out that with the arrival of Microsoft's latest CEO, Satya Nadella in 2014, this wave of innovative energy started. Although the giants of the technology industry have a lock on employer branding by their quirky hiring practices, free food, and other perks that make work "fun", the analysis of the personalities of their staffs presents a different picture. Companies like IBM, Facebook and Google aren't necessarily providing the working atmosphere that is reflected in their recruiting materials, the study showed. "You can't have 10 people in a boardroom deciding what the culture of the company is. It is defined by the people who already work there," Birwadker noted, revealing that employees who discover that their company culture is different than advertised are more likely to leave. In the study, published by Good&Co, the team analyzed the psychometric data gained from anonymous personality quizzes completed by 4,364 tech employees of what they believe are perceived as the five most innovative companies in Silicon Valley: Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and IBM. In total, the two-year-long study also analyzed 10 million responses from 2,50,000 users. Questions ranged from thoughts and feelings about networking to how they handle problems at work.

report this ad / Cory Doctorow / 7:45 am Fri Aug 12, 2016 How a digital-only smartphone opens the door to DRM (and how to close the door) From the Boing Boing Shop See all deals Popular Posts Follow Us Twitter / Facebook / RSS Fast Company's Mark Sullivan asked me to explain what could happen if Apple went through with its rumored plans to ship a phone with no analog sound outputs, only digital ones -- what kind of DRM badness might we expect to emerge? report this ad Start by understanding this: copyright lets you do a lot of stuff without permission (and even against the wishes) of rightsholders. For example, it let Apple launch the Ipod and Itunes, both of which were bitterly denounced by the record industry at their launch -- as far as they were concerned, "Rip, Mix, Burn" was an invitation to piracy, and Apple was wrong to encourage this behavior. But because copyright has limits -- fair use, and the limits on copyrightability itself -- Apple was able to revolutionize music. Enter the DMCA: in 1998, Congress passed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Section 1201 of which says that breaking DRM, even to accomplish those legal activities that lead to so much improvement and innovation in the entertainment industry (like Itunes and Ipods and Iphones) is illegal. This matters a lot. The Supreme Court told us that the only way copyright -- a government-issued monopoly over the utterance of certain words, sounds and images -- can square up with the First Amendment is through those limits on copyright: fair use and copyrightabaility's limitations. Then the Supreme Court repeated this. That's part of the basis of EFF's lawsuit to invalidate Section 1201 of the DMCA. Until we win that case, though, any digital interface with a thin scrim of DRM on it becomes a copyright no-go zone. Bypassing the DRM opens you up to felony prosecution and punishing civil penalties. That's why, if you have a CD you want to play on your Iphone, Apple provides software that automatically rips the music and seamlessly moves it to your device. But if you have a DVD -- the same kind of disc, but with a creaking DRM that was broken more than a decade ago -- Apple will invite you to buy that movie again on Itunes. The DRM on DVDs has kept them stuck in the 1990s, while the music on CDs has roared into the 21st century. Once all the audio coming out of an Iphone is digital -- once there's no analog output -- Apple gets a lot more options about how it can relate to its competitors, and they're all good for Apple and bad for Apple's customers. Just by wrapping that audio in DRM, Apple gets a veto over which of your devices can connect to your phone. They can arbitrarily withhold permission to headphone manufacturers, insist that mixers be designed with no analog outputs, or even demand that any company that makes an Apple-compatible device must not make that device compatible with Apple's competitors, so home theater components that receive Apple signals could be pressured to lock out Samsung's signals, or Amazon's. What's more, once Apple gets the ability to add DRM, the record industry gets the ability to insist that Apple use it ("A phaser on the mantelpiece in Act One must go off by Act 3" - Pavel Chekov, Star Trek: TOS). In 2007, Steve Jobs published his Thoughts on Music, in which he said, basically, that the record industry had forced Apple to put DRM in its ecosystem and he didn't like it. The record industry is still made up of the same companies, and they still love DRM. Right now, an insistence on DRM would simply invite the people who wanted to bypass it for legal reasons to use that 3.5mm headphone jack to get at it. Once that jack is gone, there's no legal way to get around the DRM. Perhaps worst of all is the impact on security research: because the DMCA has been used to attack researchers who disclosed defects in DRM-restricted technologies, they are often unable or unwilling to come forward when they discover serious vulnerabilities in technologies that we rely on. The Iphone audio interface is two-way: it supports both input and output. A bug in that interface turns the phone to carry with you at all times, to all places, into a covert listening device. A DRM system on that interface makes that bug all-but-unreportable, guaranteeing that it will last longer and hurt more people before it finally becomes public. All these bad outcomes are drawn from the real, ongoing history of DRM: limiting competitors' access to audio to ratchet up prices; limiting users' access to legal features; freezing out competition; cartel-like consortia who conspire with the entertainment companies to prevent new competitors from entering the market with desirable, legal features that they have agreed to eschew, and long-lived, dangerous bugs. So does this mean that Apple -- and every other device company -- should not make digital audio outputs for its devices? No. It means that if they do, they have to take steps now to prevent the bad outcomes in the future. Merely by asserting that the the digital audio output on an Iphone is not "an effective means of access control" under Section 1201 of the DMCA (and the laws just like it, all around the world), Apple could vaccinate itself against future pathological outcomes -- pressure from the record industry, lapses in its own judgment, wariness by security researchers. But unless it does, then going digital-only for the Iphone is a greased slippery slope that leads straight to the hottest fires of DRM hell. Doctorow says record-industry consortia could gather to make "standards" for DRM-locked audio, as the movie and TV companies have done (with Apple's cooperation) at the W3C. Such standards would let big tech companies (like Apple) interoperate with the music catalogs of the big record industry players. But it might prevent smaller upstart tech companies from doing so. "It would prevent upstarts making new, revolutionary technology from entering the market, because all the audio would be locked with DRM," Doctorow says, "so entering the fold would mean toeing the line, or risking DMCA prosecution." He adds: "I believe that Apple will not be the last company to come up with cool ways to experience, organize, and acquire music. It's natural that Apple would go along with initiatives that would stop the next Apple from launching the next iTunes, because every pirate wants to be an admiral." iPhone's Disappearing Headphone Jack Could Be Cause For Concern [Mark Sullian/Fast Company] (Image: Headphone jack 3.5mm, Jud McCranie, CC-BY-SA) SHARE / TWEET / 36 COMMENTS 1201 / apollo / apple / chekov's law / Copyfight / dmca / drm / music / war on general purpose computing report this ad GET THE BOING BOING NEWSLETTER Car Wars: a dystopian science fiction story about the nightmare of self-driving cars Melbourne’s Deakin University commissioned me to write a science fiction story about the design and regulation of self-driving cars, inspired by my essay about the misapplication of the “Trolley Problem” to autonomous vehicles.

The facility will support Apple’s online services for customers in Europe, including the iTunes Store, App Store, iMessage, Maps and Siri. “The planning body said the data centre will provide the area with a significant economic boost, adding that they took into account how hard it is to find sites that are able to accommodate huge data centres that need to be connected to the national grid,” reads the report. Apple has received planning permission to build just one data hall and support buildings. The company wants to build eight data halls on the site over the next 10-15 years but will need to apply for planning permission for each new hall. Over 200 people will be employed in the building of the data centre. Like Apple’s other facilities, this upcoming data center will be powered by renewable energy. The construction site is located in the town of Athenry in County Galway, in the vicinity of the Athenry Golf Club. Photo: Apple’s official rendering of the facility.

The company has launched a CarPlay compatible version of its SEAT DriveApp, which allows vehicle data and servicing information to be checked while still within Apple’s interface. That may not sound like a big deal, but so far Apple has proved fairly restrictive about just what third-party apps and content it’ll allow in CarPlay, something which has extended even as far as the manufacturers of the cars themselves. CarPlay lacks a specific App Store of its own, and there is just a small handful of non-Apple software – like Spotify and Pandora – which gets to put an icon on the big-button display. Even automakers, even as they’ve increasingly moved to support CarPlay, have been kept out of the loop. Until now, the most you’d see of the actual vehicle’s systems was a button to exit Apple’s system and jump back into the native infotainment UI. SEAT’s app, though, can be loaded while you’re still within CarPlay, though right now the uses are fairly basic. From DriveApp owners can see their historical usage of the car, distance traveled per month, and current status of things like the fuel tank level, wipers and battery, and when the next service is due. The automaker, which is part of the Volkswagen group, says that the app is already available in Spain and will roll out in due course to all countries where SEAT cars are sold. While that doesn’t mean much for the US specifically, it does represent a turning point for CarPlay in general. While some car companies, like Volvo, have used workarounds to show both CarPlay and their own systems simultaneously – in Volvo’s case, by splitting the large, portrait-aspect touchscreen in cars like the XC90 and S90 into two, one half showing Apple’s system and the other its own – it now looks like we’ll see much smoother integration moving forward. That’s good news for automakers and, presumably, good news for Apple too: the more you can do within CarPlay’s walls, of course, the more time you spend interacting with your iPhone and, so the research theory goes, the safer you are versus using a smartphone in your hand. Back in May, at Google I/O 2016, Hyundai demonstrated how it would put its own apps into Android Auto, Google’s rival system to CarPlay for those with recent Android smartphones.

So when a Danish company realized my weakness for wood, and sent me the Enveo Chestnut Dock, I switched out the FŪZDock to give it a try … Like many of the charging docks on the market, the Enveo one doesn’t include the charging puck itself – you have to provide your own. What you get is a three-piece assembly. The base is metal, painted either white or black. Despite my general fondness for black, the white version is a better match for the white charger you get with the Apple Watch Sport. The front element is chestnut. To anyone who likes the look of wood as much as I do, this was an instant win, aesthetically pleasing and beautifully finished. The combination of wood and white base gives it a simple, modern feel. The final element is a black silicone surround. This makes it easier to insert the charging puck, but it also has a second purpose: it’s replaceable. That means that if you ever change smartwatch, you’d just need to buy a new silicone ring. The company currently offers these for the Pebble Time and the Apple Watch. I can’t personally see myself ever switching out from the Apple Watch, but it’s good to have the option. Regular readers will know that my love of wood is matched only by my distaste for wires, and that’s where the Enveo dock scores another win: the built-in cable management. There’s enough room in the hollow inner to curl up any excess cable length to keep things neat. It has to be said that persuading the curled wire to stay put as you close the casing is a little fiddly, but it shouldn’t be something you need to do often. Once the wooden front is back in place, it is completely solid. Which is the final thing I like about the dock. The metal base gives it enough weight to stay put, without being excessively heavy (the company previously sent me a prototype model which was much heavier). The one thing that may prove a drawback for some is that the dock is quite steeply angled, sitting back about 30 degrees from the vertical. That works fine in nightstand mode given the relative heights of our bed and bedside table, but if your table is significantly higher than your bed, you may find yourself struggling to see the watch face in nightstand mode. The other issue? It’s pretty pricey, at $69. Considering that a genuine Apple charging puck will cost you around forty bucks more, that means the all-in price is a little north of $100 – a fairly stiff addition to the cost of the Watch if you have the Sport model. If you don’t want to spend this kind of money, the FŪZDock is a solid alternative, and there are even a surprising number of charging stands out there for less than $5! But if you like wood and a contemporary design, and are prepared to pay for it, the Enveo gets a thumbs-up from me. The Enveo Chestnut Dock is available for $69 from the company’s website.

Glorious. Training camp is in full swing and we're underway with the preseason. Hope is in the air and preseason heroes and villains are already taking shape. Sterling Shepard is the belle of the ball and Andre Williams is this year's Markus Kuhn. Before we get into the matchup against Miami, I wanted to share some of my thoughts on how training camp has gone so far. I haven't had a chance to visit training camp this year. It's usually an annual occurrence for me, so that's sad. My information comes from the myriad of reporters there, whether it be Jordan Raanan at ESPN, the fellas over at NJ.com, and of course, our very own Ed Valentine and Chris Pflum over at BBV (which I still read EVERY article, by the way). One quick shoutout as well to Emory Hunt, who has been covering the Giants at Football Gameplan. His videos have a TON of highlights/practice plays from every practice, so you can take a good look for yourself at how some of our players are doing. Given this information, here's 20 or so odd thoughts that have been running through my head: 1) I expect Eli Manning to record franchise shattering numbers this year. Typically, these things come in threes, and it's the third year for Manning in Ben McAdoo's system. Combine that with his performances in practice and he looks totally locked in. A goofy exterior that hides a cold-blooded assassin, Eli is coming. 2) The rookie that I'm most impressed by is not Sterling Shepard or Darian Thompson. It's Eli Apple. Is he a starter? No. Who would be when your top two corners are Janoris Jenkins and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie? All Apple has done is come in and held his own at the toughest non-QB position in the league for rookies. Sure, we see highlights of Odell Beckham torching Apple, but c'mon.... who doesn't Odell torch? Eli, in every clip I've seen has shown good technique, good strength, and good athleticism. His grabbiness has decreased and he's looking like a more nuanced player than in college. 3) The rookie that I'm most disappointed in is Jerell Adams. Let me say that it's way too early (duh), but this is a position that was wide open coming in and he was one that I had personally been looking for as early as the fifth round. He has all the makings of a very good two-way tight end, but perhaps he needs a year or two on the practice squad to try and fulfill that. 4) Much like Rueben Randle (who is killing it apparently in Philly's training camp), Larry Donnell always puts on a show in August. I want to see how he does when the lights come on. Too many mistakes during the regular season, but if he comes in and fixes those mental mistakes, a combo of Donnell-Tye is another explosive weapon for Manning. 5) My vote for biggest surprise/biggest impact is Owamagbe Odighizuwa. He's simply too explosive and too powerful not to make a splash if he stays healthy. A year under his belt and without any health restrictions and he can perhaps show us exactly what made him such a hyped up prospect. If not as a defensive end, he can certainly make waves as a DT in that "Four Aces" package that Spags likes. 6) Odell Beckham is the best player in the NFC East. 7) Every time I hear Andre Willliams' name mentioned, it is how he gets stopped in the backfield. He's the tenuous No. 2 right now, but in year 3 there's going to be more than a critical eye towards him. Pat Traina's article a few days back had Jonathan Casillas mention that the most surprising player in training camp was Paul Perkins. Watch out, Andre. 8) Iron sharpens iron. Nothing has gotten me more excited than looking at some of these matchups: Odell Beckham vs. Janoris Jenkins. Damon Harrison vs. Weston Richburg. Eli Apple vs. Sterling Shepard. This is fun. 9) Olivier Vernon is the worst type of defensive end for Ereck Flowers. and that's a good thing. Vernon is a pure leverage player. He's shorter than your average defensive end at 6-foot-2, and he's got tremendous burst. If you have technique lapses, you're going to get whipped. This should hopefully serve as some kind of motivation/teaching tool. 10) Speaking of Flowers, I will be watching him a lot. Everybody speaks to his athleticism, but it's completely wasted if you don't use it right. Markus Kuhn is a 300-pounder who has a 35-inch vertical, clearly showed that athleticism while he was here (/sarcasm). What good is Flowers' 80 bazillion bench press reps if he can't time or land his punch consistently? What good is his wide body and lower body power if he negates that by lunging at speed rushers? What good is his foot speed if his base is too wide or too narrow for him to move properly? The grace period he's had as a rookie is over. It's time to show something. 11) I want to see teams try and rush against the New York Giants this year. A lineup of Johnathan Hankins and Snacks Harrison inside with Jason Pierre-Paul and Vernon outside should make it easy for the linebacking corps to come up and handle the run game. I am not scared of that Cowboys OL after seeing Hankins and Snacks together in practice. 12) Speaking of the linebacking corps, you hope and pray that Devon Kennard and Keenan Robinson, both oft-injured, stay healthy. They are the lynchpins of that group, with Kennard providing the pass rush and Robinson with the coverage. Jasper Brinkley and Kelvin Sheppard are capable of banging inside against the run in the middle spot. I don't see any room for Mark Herzlich on this team as of right now. 13) I think at some point this season, if not to start the season, Geremy Davis will start opposite Odell Beckham. He's got size and he's shown that he's got the ability to create separation at the catch point, if not anywhere else on the route. And that's okay. The common thread between Beckham, Sterling Shepard, and Davis? They don't have drops. Davis especially has shown the ability to be a big target down the field. 14) Donte Deayon has to make this team. He doesn't look as dimunitive as his measurements suggest and he's just got a knack for the ball like his teammate at Boise State and current Giant starting free safety Darian Thompson. He's quick and he's aggressive. The Giants need more of that. 15) Deayon should be joined by two other undrafted free agents, one of them being Greg Milhouse. The Giants need a penetrator on that defensive front. They've got their two hogs and Jay Bromley has been middling in his attempts to single gap rush. Milhouse can be that stressor along the defensive front, especially if Big Hank or Snacks take up two blockers. 16) The third UDFA should be either Roger Lewis or Darius Powe. I'm honestly not sure who. If the Giants prefer size, Powe would be the answer. Lewis has apparently been slightly more impressive in practice. The preseason games will determine this and it's one of the fiercest battles on this roster. 17) Victor Cruz. Is this the end? After seeing what happened to Hakeem Nicks, I don't think my heart could take it. 18) I don't know if it's Ben McAdoo or if it's this new strength and conditioning coach or if it's just the Football Gods having some form of mercy, but that issue that we will not mention that has crushed this team over the past few years hasn't reared it's ugly head...yet. Let's hope and pray. 19) Speaking of Ben McAdoo, all reports are that the players have bought in. That's all you can hope for at this point. It remains to be seen if he'll FUBAR this thing during the regular season, but the stage doesn't look too big for him and that's reassuring. 20) Lastly, when the Giants go up against Miami, give me one solid opening touchdown drive by the offense and a three-and-out on defense and get the starters the hell out of there. Invictus XI's 53 Man Roster (Starters in italics) This is who I'd pick as my top 53 players. Not necessarily a prediction.

It should be remembered, however, that the Galaxy Note 7 is actually the successor to the Galaxy Note 5. Samsung decided to skip a number in the series to eliminate inconsistencies in its product line, as it released the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge earlier this year. However, the bigger reason is that Samsung thought naming the device as the Galaxy Note 6 will make customers think that it is inferior to Apple's upcoming flagship smartphones, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus are expected to be released by September or October, with the larger model expected to go head-to-head with the Galaxy Note 7 in the cutthroat smartphone market. For customers looking to purchase a high-end, large-display smartphone, should they grab the Galaxy Note 7 this month, or wait a month or two for the iPhone 7 Plus? A quick comparison of the specifications and features of the two smartphones should give customers a better idea on which device they should purchase. It should be noted, however, that with no official announcement yet for the iPhone 7, the details presented below are only rumored ones, though coming from reliable sources. Display The Galaxy Note 7 packs a 5.7-inch dual-curved Super AMOLED display with high QHD resolution, a display that has been tagged as the best smartphone display ever. The 5.5-inch Retina display of the iPhone 7 Plus, meanwhile, is expected to largely be the same as the iPhone 6s Plus, though possibly with an upgraded sharpness to 1,080p. Processor And RAM Powering the Galaxy Note 7 are the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 or Samsung Exynos 8890 processors that were used for the Galaxy S7 line, with the chipset used depending on the region of the smartphone. The Galaxy Note 7 also has the same 4 GB of RAM as the Galaxy S7 line. The iPhone 7 Plus is expected to come with 3 GB of RAM, compared with only 2 GB of RAM of the iPhone 7 and its predecessors iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. The device will be powered by Apple's A10 processor, which is the successor to the A9 chipset used for the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. Camera The Galaxy Note 7 also features the same camera as the Galaxy S7 line, with a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera. The iPhone 7, meanwhile, is said to be featuring a dual-lens rear camera system, which is the reason for the RAM upgrade. Storage The internal storage of the Galaxy Note 7 starts at 64 GB, compared with the native storage of 32 GB for the Galaxy S7. The Samsung smartphone, however, also features expandable memory through a microSD card slot that will add up to 256 GB in storage. The iPhone 7, for the first time in the history of Apple's smartphone line, will drop the 16 GB storage option, making the 32 GB option the lowest option in addition to 64 GB and 256 GB models. The iPhone 7, like all other iPhones, will not feature expandable memory. Other Features Other important features for the Galaxy Note 7 include the trademark S Pen stylus, which has been upgraded to make it water-resistant and more accurate, a USB Type-C connector and an iris scanner for added security. The iPhone 7 Plus, on the other hand, is said to be coming with a redesigned Force Touch Home button, with the 3.5mm headphone jack replaced by a Lightning connector. The antenna lines of the smartphone are also said to have been redesigned to give the device a cleaner look. Price The Galaxy Note 7 will come with a price tag of $849 once it launches in the United States, while the 32 GB iPhone 7 Plus is rumored to be coming with a price tag of around $900. Verdict As always, the final decision comes down to the consumer. The good thing about the decision is that whichever smartphone you decide to purchase, you will surely end up with a high-quality premium smartphone with powerful specifications and the latest features.

The photos show what appear to be the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7s Plus, which is the only model with Apple's Smart Connector port and "S" logo.  ( Weibo ) Advertisement Several new images of Apple's upcoming iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have leaked. The photos provide a close-up look at what is believed to be the new space black color option, in addition to gold and rose gold variants. With each passing year, it's becoming increasingly difficult for smartphone makers to keep their unannounced next-generation handsets out of the public's eye. Whether it comes in the form of leaked specs, new features or actual images of a yet-to-be announced device, tech fans can follow their favorite smartphone maker's future handset on an almost-daily basis. For instance, if you love Google's Nexus smartphones and their guarantee of always having the latest and greatest version of Android, you got your first report that HTC was building Google's next-generation smartphones back in January. Renders of the HTC Nexus Marlin and Nexus Sailfish first leaked in July, and those images were quickly followed up with a video detailing their design later in the month. Most recently, the five-inch Sailfish was spotted on AnTuTu benchmark. iPhone fans got a jump on Apple's upcoming iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in November 2015, a couple of weeks after the company began selling its current iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. That initial report claimed what sounded unthinkable at the time, that Apple would drop the standard 3.5 mm headphone port and instead use its Lightning port for charging, data transfer and audio. Several reports over the last few months have backed up that claim, and most recently, a video showed what are supposedly Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus' Lightning EarPods in action. Smartphone fans also have a pretty good idea of what Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will look like ahead of the company's expected September launch event, as images and videos of the smartphones have been leaking on an almost-daily basis. The latest iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus leak comes in the form of several images, which show the smartphones in various color options. It appears that Apple will introduce a new space black hue to replace space gray. The iPhone 7 Plus' dual-lens rear camera is shown, as well as the larger rear shooter expected on the smaller iPhone 7. The handsets' Apple logo and iPhone branding are also in view. Another set of images show what appears to be space black, rose gold and gold iPhone 7 Plus handsets with Apple's proprietary Smart Connector on the lower rear of the device. As you can see in the image above, these models also have an "S" stamped below the iPhone branding, just like Apple's current iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, leading some to believe Apple may launch three iPhone 7 models: an iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7s Plus. Take these new images with a grain of salt for now, however, as it has also been widely reported that Apple canceled the Smart Connector port from this year's iPhones.

From the dual lens camera and the twin external speakers to the redesigned antenna lines and the missing headphone jack , many of the iPhone 7 's key features have already been leaked. But one question still hanging in the air is when Apple will unveil the long-awaited gadget - and when you'll be able to get your hands on it. There are, of course, plenty of rumours about that too. Read More iPhone 7: Release date, leaked images, price rumours and all the latest news about Apple's next iPhone Apple usually launches its flagship iPhones in the first half of September, and notorious leaker Evan Blass (aka @evleaks ) has predicted the new iPhone will go on sale on September 16 - with preorders starting a week earlier on September 9. Now Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman, who made his name as a famously accurate Apple leaks specialist at 9to5Mac, has named September 7 as the day of the launch event. Read More iPhone 7 launch date CONFIRMED - Apple to unveil its new smartphone next week The date was buried in an article about MacBook Pro upgrades, but spotted by Forbes journalist Gordon Kelly . "The MacBook Pros aren’t likely to debut at an event currently scheduled for Sept. 7 to introduce next-generation versions of the iPhone," wrote Gurman. Read More iPhone 7: Release date, leaked images, price rumours and all the latest news about Apple's next iPhone The dates all fit nicely together, but suggest the iPhone 7 launch timescale could be significantly more condensed than in recent years. Last year, the iPhone 6s didn't hit the shelves until September 25 - two weeks after the launch event on September 9. Meanwhile, the latest leaked photos reinforce previous rumours that the iPhone 7 will feature a pressure-sensitive home button. The pictures, which come from phone repair company GeekBar supposedly show the iPhone 7 display assembly, with part of the standard home button cut-out visible.

However, the consensus is that, if Apple does make this change, it won't be until next year, when the company is supposedly planning a major design overhaul for the iPhone. The addition of pressure sensitivity to the existing home button in this year's iPhone model may be intended as a stopgap, allowing app developers to start experimenting with potential uses for this new feature.

That scored 7/10, and was praised for its smooth, flexible hinge, the slick Chrome OS, and while it's not without its issues, we deemed it stonkingly good value for money. Read our full Lenovo N20 review here What you said: The Lenovo N22 holds an impressive 4.6/5 score on Amazon, based on 68 user reviews.

However, glancing at the spec sheet, we're impressed. The Intel Celeron processor takes care of most day-to-day tasks, including web-browsing, word-processing and Netflix binging.

How good a deal is this? The Lenovo Ideapad 100S usually retails at £229.99, so an £80 saving is nothing to turn your nose up at.

We had this model's little sibling in for review and we really liked it. We particularly liked the fact that at 14-inches it was thin and portable but didn't sacrifice a good screen for the cause. The model we had to test kept up with our needs despite the smaller Intel Core i3 processor. It's even better then, that the Ideapad on offer here has a larger Intel Core i5 processor. Add on the already equipped SSD and this is a seriously speedy machine. Buy now: Lenovo Ideapad 510s for £529 from Very - saving £70 How good a deal is this?

Recover your password Delimiter About Delimiter Contact us Ethics Principles Privacy Site Terms Comments policy Consumer Tech News Apple rejects banks’ proposed mobile payments “cartel” By Daniel Palmer - 12/08/2016 8 news In a strongly worded letter to the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC), Apple has rejected the formation of a mobile payments “cartel” proposed by four major Australian banks. Should the ACCC grant permission for the group’s formation, it would have the right to “jointly negotiate the terms and conditions with third-party mobile wallet providers, including Apple, and institute a joint boycott during those negotiations”, the tech giant pointed out. Further, Apple said, the banks’ application is so full of “factual and legal misstatements” that it has not been able to prepare a comprehensive submission. That will follow at “a later date”, the firm said. In the meanwhile, Apple “strongly” urged the ACCC to reject the request for interim authorisation. If granted, it said, the request would “harm consumers, lead to less competition and less innovation, and create a troubling precedent”. The Cupertino-based firm went on to argue that three of the banks – Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank and Westpac – are three of the four biggest banks in Australia, and that “given their scale and market share”, the applicants are essential to its ability to offer Apple Pay on a “meaningful basis” within Australia. The fourth financial institution in the applying group is Bendigo and Adelaide Bank. Apple further confirmed that it “struggled” to negotiate agreements with the Australian banks when introducing its mobile wallet service to Australia. “Unfortunately, and based on their limited understanding of the offering, the applicants perceive Apple Pay as a competitive threat,” Apple said. “These banks want to maintain complete control over their customers.” “The present application is only the latest tactic employed by these competing banks to blunt Apple’s entry into the Australian market,” it added. Apple’s claim is at odds with comments last December from Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens who said in a letter to a Labor MP that he has not seen “any evidence” that Australia’s major banks are actively boycotting the Apple Pay mobile payments service. Such a boycott would represent a “hard-core breach of the Competition and Consumer Act”, Apple said. Accusing the banks of relying on “innuendo and misstatements” to support their application, Apple suggested the banks have “little direct insight” into Apple Pay or Apple’s terms. To back up the claim, the firm said one of the four banks has “refused” to enter into a confidentiality agreement with Apple to discuss the terms under which it might participate in Apple Pay. The banks’ application to the ACCC for permission to negotiate with Apple as a collective group is aimed to “force Apple and other third party providers” to accept their terms, and allow them to charge consumers choosing to use Apple Pay, Apple said. Innovation would be another victim of the banks’ plans, according to Apple, which said: “It would slow innovation and reduce choices by protecting members of the cartel from competition with each other for the next three years. The banks would have little incentive to compete amongst themselves to develop the best and most innovative payment services for their customers.” The ACCC and its predecessor have never before authorised a collective boycott. While the banks have sought ACCC approval on “public interest” grounds, Apple said it “cannot identify any public benefits that could arise from the boycott”, and further that the banks’ application “lacks any proper evidence that could safely be relied on to substantiate such benefits”. The iPhone maker went on to say that the authorisation is “inappropriate” under the ACCC’s Authorisation Guidelines if it has the potential to be “significantly anticompetitive” and the applicant has not demonstrated “compelling reasons”. “The banks have failed to provide compelling reasons in this case that would justify the significant risks of anticompetitive outcomes,” Apple said.

Let’s not give more money to a company that does everything it can to dodge paying it’s due’s in this country. Daniel Rossi 12/08/2016 at 10:14 pm mobile is a cartel. They collude to protect their insecure white elephant trash from fibre internet. I would never do transactions over mobile whatsoever. Now we’ve just learnt Android is vulnerable to the Linux TCP hole and older phones are now not receiving software security updates. I know mine isn’t. Phones have no firewalls of any kind. Banks are stuffed also. They kill business with their criminal transaction fees. We aren’t a cash economy after all. With IP gateway terminals they should be connected via VPN also not over a public network to the bank. Chris B 13/08/2016 at 9:56 am Apple has precisely nothing to gain from operating services, payments, streaming media, etc, in the corrupt, fragmented and tiny Australian market. They should just sell their gadgets (marked up with a hefty Australian Consumer Law Tax to pay for our political bullshit) and stay the fuck away from “distrupting” our corrupt 1960’s era banking and media sectors. Gavin 17/08/2016 at 12:19 pm What they have to gain is market share in the mobile phone industry. Apple Pay would be a great tool for getting extra people to buy their devices if they are the only recognised brand offering this type of payment service. Daniel 15/08/2016 at 10:31 am I can already picture Apple being forced to pull out of dealing financial business with Australia at this rate. Would this give Australia a bad reputation with other companies thinking about expanding a presence here? Of course its all about money, but they are apparently concerned about customer security and looks like Apple do not want to risk that. Paul 16/08/2016 at 7:48 pm Very surprised by the comments so far. Bigger picture guys! If they can block ApplePay, then they can do the same for Android and any other payment system that they don’t like. This is all about the 3 major banks stopping innovation so that they can control there profits. PeterA 18/08/2016 at 10:31 am Android pay is open enough that they can develop their own competitors on the platform. I already use the NAB app to use my phone as an NFC payment device. Because Android is an open platform that allows that. Apple require all payments to go through their own app. No one can write their own payment system that runs on the Apple hardware. I think both sides of this are scumbags. Apple for holding the banks to ransom and denying them the chance to write their own payment processing (effectively asking for a kickback for letting people use their platform), and the banks, for colluding with the credit card companies to maintain their monopolies (and I haven’t heard great things about the EFTPOS system really… but I am uninformed on this point). Paul 18/08/2016 at 6:04 pm Hi Peter, well I didn’t know that! I believe ApplePay is locked to Touch ID, so they don’t what to seperate it out for security concerns… and if they get to force money out of banks, well that an “unfortunate” side effect! How is the process on an Android phone? Do you have to unlock and open the app to make a payment? Comments are closed.

Interestingly, however, it seems Apple is using variable pricing in these different locations, unbeknownst to many artists and publishers. _______________________ Guest Post by Bobby Owsinski on Music 3.0 If you want to get your music to be heard in every part of the planet, then Apple Music is currently the way to go. Apple recently announced that it has expanded its reach to 114 countries, far more than any other service at the moment. Spotify, which Music Business Worldwide now estimates at 36 million paid subscribers, is only in 60 countries at the moment, and despite the graphic disadvantage, seems to be growing faster than Apple Music. Still, you can’t argue with the footprint that Apple Music has, as it’s now available in in prized territories like China, Turkey, Taiwan and Israel. One of the things that most artists and bands aren’t aware of though, is that Apple Music utilizes variable pricing from country to country. This means that while subscribers in the U.S. pay $9.99 per month, Israeli subscribers pay about $5.20 and Russian subscribers around $3. That means that if most of your streams come from a low paying territory, you’ll be paid a lower royalty as a result. The variable pricing is a result of a “what the market will bear” that Apple also uses for iTunes, which proved to be successful in the past. In the last few years Spotify has also launched in a number of other countries as well, adding Italy, Poland, Portugal, Mexico, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Estonia, Latvia, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Chile, Cyprus and Czech Republic to the list. The company expects to launch in Russia and Japan later this year. Spotify also utilizes variable pricing, but most of the time the price is actually higher than the U.S. For instance, Australians pay $11.25 while Swedes pay the equivalent of $15.22. Poles only pay $6.62 however. What this shows is that streaming is expanding both territorially, and revenue-wise, which can only be good for artists, bands, labels and songwriters everywhere. The problem is that the variable pricing makes it a lot more difficult to determine just how much an average stream is worth, something that will haunt us all for some time.

Share Tweet Share Tags : Apple-Apple+ Display-Display+ A few years back, Apple was tipped to be fronting Sharp a cool $1 billion to retool its existing Kameyama mobile display plant for the high-res displays of the future. Subsequently, Sharp ran into huge financial troubles, and its good but expensive LTPS and other panels never made it en masse to iPhones and iPads, so Apple's investment was in the end said to be around $100 million in total. Fast forward to today, and Apple's iPhone assembler, Foxconn, finally got the green light from the Chinese authorities to acquire Sharp for the no-less cool $3.8 billion. The struggling Japanese company will thus be folded in the sprawling conglomerate of the flamboyant CEO Terry Gou, but not for its excellent phones with the best screen-to-body ratio that are only sold in Japan. In fact, the display know-how of Sharp will reportedly help Foxconn fulfill the future needs of its master Apple, and the rumored shift to OLED displays for the 2017 iPhone, and probably the subsequent ones. Sharp has been rumored to work with Apple on OLED display tech for a while, but for now it doesn't have the money and scale to produce them in mass numbers with the price and quality that Samsung or LG would offer, so it lookс like Apple might stick with Samsung for next year's "disruptive" iPhone edition.  With Foxconn's production facilities, and Apple's money, however, those three might crack the OLED code all on their own, so that Apple can reduce its part supply dependence on its chief rival in the smartphone realm. Sharp is also holding patents on its IGZO display technology, which is very frugal, and allows Sharp phones to easily last two days on a charge, yet is available in 4K mobile screens, so there is plenty of benefits to look forward to from that acquisition. source: FT Editor's pick   iPhone 7 Plus vs $1600 camera: which takes better portraits?   iPhone 8 and GS8 to come with 'edge-to-edge' screens, how is that possible?

While we have only seen design changes coming with the product, a new leak reveals what A10 chipset might look like. Apple iPhone 6s is powered by A9 processor and its natural for the next processor to bear the A10 name. Apple generally introduces a new processor lineup with iPhone and an X variant of the same processor follows the iPad range. The recent iPad range – which includes 12.9-inch iPad Pro and 9.7-inch iPad Pro – are powered by Apple’s A9X chipset. The images of A10 chipset posted on Chinese social network Weibo reveal the die of the new processor along with design of the logic board. The leak doesn’t reveal any details about the new processor but Apple CEO Tim Cook already hinted at the iPhone will be very compelling in terms of performance. Apple is likely to launch three new iPhones at its special event in September (rumoured to be held on September 7) with redesigned antenna layout, a protruding ring to protect the camera lens and a new home button with support for haptic feedback. Apple is likely to follow the leads of LeEco, Motorola and drop the 3.5mm headphone jack and is reportedly working on lightning connected headphones. Earlier we saw renders of lightning connector based Apple earpods leak on China’s Weibo platform.

Apple iPhone 7 is also reported to come in space black colour variant along with rose gold, gold and space grey colour options (Source: Techtastic) A leaked Geekbench listing revealed A10 processor’s single core benchmark score of 3000, which puts it right in the league of A9X processor powering iPad Pro. Apple’s A9X is the most powerful processor ever packed into a mobile device and it is likely that iPhone 7 will be the most powerful smartphone when it launches next month. Apple is also likely to introduce a new space black colour variant this time. Last year, Apple introduced Rose Gold as a new colour option and it immediately turned into a rage among iPhone buyers. This time around, it could be time to go completely black with iPhone 7.

Apple first announced plans for the $950M data center some 18 months ago, aiming to deliver better connectivity to European customers for all its online services. All looked on track as the company was quickly granted planning permission for the facility, but despite the fact that the center will be entirely powered by renewable energy, an appeal was lodged on environmental grounds … The planning body An Bord Pleanála asked Apple to address five concerns, which it did in May. It was announced earlier this week that the inspector responsible for scrutinizing Apple’s response had submitted his recommendations, and An Bord Pleanala has now given the final go-ahead for both the data center itself and associated electrical substation. A number of third party appeals were lodged with An Bord Pleanála against the decision of Galway County Council to grant planning permission for the development. The Board’s decision is to grant permission for the proposed development with revised conditions. A separate application from Apple Distribution Limited was also lodged on 12th February, 2016 to allow for a 220kV electricial substation and a number of towers. This case was also considered by the Board on 10th August, 2016. The Board’s decision is to approve the proposed development. The approval requires Apple to carry out all of the proposals put forward in its oral response to objections, as well as imposing additional conditions. These include reducing the number of car-parking spaces, promptly restoring removed or damaged trees, limiting noise levels, running all external cables underground, ensuring no extra development above roof level and facilitating an archaeological appraisal of the site. Apple had originally aimed to have the center operational by next year, a deadline which now looks unlikely following the significant delays resulting from the appeals process. Apple says that the center will meet the company’s needs for the next 10-15 years.

The ad titled 'The Human Family' is part of the company's 'Shot on iPhone' campaign. It has voice of poet Maya Angelou and seeks to show people from different countries who are competing at the Games. The Apple commercial also has not one but three images from India. While it surely is flattering, there's also a bit of disappointment that the world's most-loved technology brand stuck to cliches. India's representation in the ad is in the form of three sadhus and a famished-looking peasant (who seems to be looking at sky awaiting rains). While Apple sees India as a market with huge growth potential and is said to be upping its ante here, the perception among the top echelons of the company about the country still seems to be that of the 'being a land of snake charmers'. The ad seems to reinforce the popular western view about India. The 'sadhus' in the ad wearing long tikas are surely part of our culture. But, they symobolise our country as much as our journey to Mars -— that too on a shoestring budget. And yes Apple, we are still an agrarian economy and proud to be one. But remember, we also have an army of software engineers who drive the codes at IT behemoths around the world, as do our ISRO scientists, who are good a match to NASA scientists (may be if not better). India also boasts of a diversity far bigger than you can fathom. This 'unity in diversity' is quintessentially India, more than anything else. And so, would have been a wonderful representation of the country. So Apple, next time you decide to include us in your global ads, we will really appreciate if you look beyond our 'Sadhus' and 'farmers'. > RELATED From around the web From GADGETSNOW Recommended By Colombia From Around the Web From GADGETSNOW Recommended By Colombia Comments Sort By:Up VotedNewestOldestDiscussedDown Voted Characters Remaining: 3000 OR PROCEED WITHOUT REGISTRATION Share on FacebookShare on Twitter SIGN IN WITHFacebookGoogleEmail Refrain from posting comments that are obscene, defamatory or inflammatory, and do not indulge in personal attacks, name calling or inciting hatred against any community.

The new Apple data centre will be in Athenry, costing the company some €850m of an overall €1.7bn investment that will see a similar centre built in Denmark. Renewable energy projects are at the core of this build, with the company claiming that it will run the centre on 100pc renewable energy. When completed, the centre will power Apple’s online services, including the iTunes Store, the App Store, iMessage, Maps and Siri, for customers across Europe. To be built on a 500-acre greenfield site in Derrydonnell, the company hopes the new facility will be open by the end of next year. Though despite the financial outlay and the promise of some 150 jobs in the area upon completion – added to the jobs that will be created by the construction work needed to erect the facility – the plan wasn’t to everybody’s liking. However, after considering the objections it received, An Bord Pleanála has given the official go-ahead to Apple. The 24,500sqm Athenry data centre will be the company’s largest data centre project in Europe. In another planning application, Apple sought approval for a 220kV electrical substation and a number of towers. Again, after objections, An Bord Pleanála has given official approval. As part of the deal, Apple has had to sign up to a number of conditions, including providing a €1m fund for ocean energy testing in Galway, as well as committing to the planting of native trees to offset the environmental impact of the build. It is understood that the data centre, which will come online in 2017, will have a 6MW requirement and this will grow to 30MW when it is fully operational. This could grow to 240MW in 10 to 15 years’ time. This all adds to recent assertions, posited by Ronan Harris, head of Google Ireland, that Ireland is the data capital of Europe. A detailed report published by global data analyst group 451 Advisors in 2013 predicted that Ireland’s data centre industry would overtake the UK and mainland Europe locations, with a growth rate of 18pc over the coming years.

 Apple's pricey data center finally gets the green light Sam Shead Aug. 12, 2016, 11:36 AM 4,087 facebook linkedin twitter email print A computer generated image of Apple's data centre. Apple Apple has been given the green light to build the first data hall for a huge new data center on a 197-hectare site near the west coast of Ireland. Irish planning body An Bord Pleanála gave Apple's first data hall the go ahead on Wednesday despite opposition from a number of individuals and local businesses. The planning body said the data center will provide the area with a significant economic boost, adding that they took into account how hard it is to find sites that are able to accommodate huge data centers that need to be connected to the national grid. Apple has received planning permission to build just one data hall but it hopes to build a total of eight on the site over the next 10-15 years. The iPhone maker will have to apply for planning permission every time it wants to open a new data hall. The facility will be built in the middle of a forest just outside the small town of Athenry in County Galway. It will initially consist of a single data hall, an administration building, and other associated developments. Over 200 people will be employed in the building of the data center, while a significantly smaller number of IT workers and data center technicians will operate the facility when it's built. The data center — which Apple says will be totally powered by renewable energy — will be built on land that state forestry company Coillte used for growing and harvesting non-native trees. Apple plans to restore native trees to Derrydonnell Forest and create an outdoor education space for local schools, as well as a walking trail for the community. Apple Maps/Skitch/Sam Shead Apple's Irish data center plans were approved last September by Galway County Council but they were held up after a number of appeals were made to An Bord Pleanála. Appellants raised concerns over the impact on the local wildlife, the data center's energy usage, and flooding, among other things. Apple wants to use the data center to store European user data and to help power online services including the iTunes Store, the App Store, iMessage, Maps, and Siri for customers across Europe, according to a press release announcing the development in February 2015. The Cupertino company was hoping to have the facility up and running by early 2017 but that target date now looks unrealistic given Apple is yet to start any building work. Some 5,500 of Apple's 18,300 European staff are based in Ireland, which is also home to its European headquarters. The company has pledged to hire an additional 1,000 staff in Ireland before 2017. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have also built data centers in Ireland, and Facebook also has one planned. Elsewhere in Europe, Apple is planning to build a data center in Denmark on the same scale as the one in Ireland. The company does not reveal where all of its data centers are but reports suggest Apple also has data center facilities in Newark, Santa Clara, and Cupertino on the west coast of the US, as well one in Maiden on the east coast. Business Insider contacted Apple about the data center completion date but did not immediately hear back. NOW WATCH: How to supercharge your iPhone in 5 minutes Loading video...

It's expecting even more people this year, according to officials at the Cambridge, Mass.-based marketing automation provider. HubSpot Inbound takes place Nov. 8 to 11 at the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center. Last year, HubSpot competed with Content Marketing Institute's (CMI) Content Marketing World in Cleveland, which featured 3,500 attendees. Conferences were held the same week in early September.  They aren't going head-to-head again this year: CMI kept the early-September date for its conference while HubSpot moved it back to November. Interestingly, HubSpot's conference falls on the day Americans vote for a new president: Tuesday, Nov. 8. But HubSpot's helping Americans attending its conference get out their votes. It posted an FAQ that directs them to absentee ballots. HubSpot this week announced the addition of tennis star Serena Williams as one of its guest speakers. She has 22 Grand Slam titles — victories in the sport's four major events: Australian Open, Wimbledon, US Open and French Open. She joins Reshma Saujani, the founder and CEO of Girls Who Code, a national non-profit organization working to close the gender gap in technology and prepare young women for jobs of the future, actor Alec Baldwin and several other keynote speakers.  In other software technology news ... Madison Logic Expands Activate ABM  New York City-based account-based marketing provider Madison Logic announced new attribution and engagement analytics for its Activate ABM platform. Officials said the platform provides B2B marketers with a combination of targeted advertising and content syndication to influence prospective accounts. Marketers can measure the amount of time an account spends with specific content and attributes that exposure to engagement on a website, driving demand — and ultimately leads — to fill the sales pipeline, according to company officials. "With these insights, B2B marketers can now better optimize targeted advertising and content syndication tactics to influence their prospects and ultimately drive revenue," Madison Logic CEO Tom O'Regan said in a statement. "Activate ABM provides visibility into how two previously siloed tactics work together to drive product awareness and pipeline." Carnegie Partners With BlueConic Westford, Mass.-based Carnegie Communications, which provides digital marketing solutions for higher education, announced a partnership with BlueConic, a Boston-based customer data platform. Carnegie has offered colleges marketing and recruitment solutions for 30 years. Through the BlueConic partnership, Carnegie officials promised to provide their clients the ability to track prospective student activity, synchronize the data associated with each individual student and deliver a personal experience across their entire marketing ecosystem — from web, social, CRM systems, mobile apps and analytics tools.  Joe Moore, CEO of Carnegie Communications, said in a statement his company "has always been dedicated to going above and beyond" for clients. He added, "By providing this service they gain a competitive edge in having the ability to understand and to cater to the intent of each student prospect on their site.” Workplace Happiness ... or Not Good&Co released its “Tech Industry: Quantified Culture & Workplace Happiness Report" this week that revealed findings about the corporate culture of some of the tech industry’s biggest players including Apple, Facebook, Google, IBM and Microsoft.  The report used more than 10 million anonymous, psychometric data points collected from more than 4,000 Good&Co app users over the last two years. It quantifies the personality traits that have the greatest impact on employee success at each organization: social boldness, persistence, curiosity, organization and adventurousness.  According to the report: Facebook is demonstrably lacking when it comes to fostering a culture of creativity According to hiring practices, Microsoft is more innovative than Apple, despite being commonly considered the more conservative company of the two The most successful tech industry employees are easily inspired and fully committed Employees at Apple and Twitter perceive their company as it’s actually managed, an insight that is indicative of a good company culture “While each individual, and therefore each workplace culture, is unique, assessing data in aggregate across large samples has provided us with unprecedented insights into what it’s really like to work at some of the industry's most desirable and competitive organizations,” Samar Birwadker, Good&Co CEO, said in a statement.  “Until now, there has been no way to measure company culture and employee fit — two critical success factors for both employees and HR professionals. We put people and culture first again, by quantifying both company culture and fit to re-humanize the recruiting process, fight back against employee turnover and to produce a long-term, positive impact on organizations’ hiring processes.” Facebook employees scored 10 percent lower on intellectual curiosity than Apple employees. Facebook employees were on average 17 percent and 18 percent less adventurous than Microsoft and Apple employees, respectively. When compared to Microsoft, Apple employees were on average 7 percent more intellectually curious, 13 percent more competitive, 13 percent more methodical. Apple employees were also 8 percent less prone to mood changes (or less volatile) than Microsoft employees. Marketers' Priorities Where are marketers putting their energies — and money? To find out, R2i partnered with research firm Clutch to survey mid-market and enterprise organizations across US-based B2B and B2C brands. The survey was conducted with 500 marketing professionals at companies with at least 500 employees. About half surveyed have more than 1,000 employees and more than $100 million in annual revenue.  Here's what researchers found: Multichannel marketing is not an optional strategy for reaching customers into today’s buying environment. While a brand’s website remains the number one channel used by brands to connect with their audience, the majority of marketers need a healthy mix of digital, offline and mobile channels to stay in front of their buyers Brand awareness and customer loyalty rank as close top priorities for marketers yet more and more CMOs are responsible for showing ROI in investments. Capturing the lasting loyalty — and dollars — of a desired audience remains at the top of marketers “to do” list Survey respondents ranked TV advertising as the top priority despite 2015 Nielsen data indicating that more than 40 percent of TV content is now viewed on screens other than a traditional TV While the website for marketers may have previously been simply a brand asset, a digital platform on which to tell the brand story, it is now the most important technology along with an analytics solution, for marketing execution Smooch Raises $10 Million San Francisco-based Smooch, which helps companies facilitate customer conversations over messaging and communication platforms, announced this week that it has secured about $7.7 million in an institutional seed round. The financing is a co-investment led by Real Ventures and iNovia Capital, with participation from TA Associates and Smooch’s founders. Smooch will use this financing round to expand its support for consumer messaging channels and business software vendors, and to continue to build its team. The company is currently hiring for more than 20 positions in San Francisco and Montreal, including senior sales, product marketing and engineering positions. Smooch features a unified messaging platform, the Smooch Conversation CloudSM, that is designed to allow companies use to their existing business software and processes to have conversations with their customers through messaging apps and SMS, to websites, mobile apps and more. Smooch integrates with consumer messaging channels such as Facebook Messenger, LINE, WeChat, Kik, Telegram, Twilio and others. Cision Appoints Global CEO Cision, a global media intelligence and communications solution provider and portfolio company of GTCR, announced that Kevin Akeroyd has been named global CEO. Akeroyd succeeds Peter Granat, who will transition to chairman of the Cision Board of Directors. Akeroyd has more than 25 years of experience in digital, social and mobile marketing globally. Most recently he was general manager and senior vice president at Oracle Marketing Cloud. Prior to Oracle, Akeroyd held senior leadership positions at companies including Data.com, Salesforce.com and RR Donnelley. “Peter Granat has been an innovative leader with a proven track record of success, and I am grateful for his work to bring the company to such an elite position of strength in the industry,” Akeroyd said. “I look forward to working with Peter and the entire Cision team in the company’s ongoing efforts to deliver innovative products and services to marketing and communications professionals.” Under Granat, Cision has grown from $130 million in revenue to more than $630 million in revenue, and has completed five acquisitions in the last two years.

Random-Apps makes it easy for iOS users to discover cool and exciting apps that they might normally not encounter via the App Store. The app presents a random listing of quality 4 and 5-star apps directly from the App Store, and because the apps are presented randomly, there's no bias towards displaying apps from developers that have the deepest pockets. Since the early days of the App Store, Apple's iTunes Store and App Store have been the only convenient way to discover apps. Unfortunately, app discovery via those apps has long been broken. While the big boys can easily buy attention for their new apps by advertising, running big contests, and gaining a prominent position in the App Store, the little guys are left to fight for attention. Random-Apps' random presentation system guarantees equal discovery for all the best apps in the store, no matter who the developer is. "We love discovering new apps, but Apple's app discovery system has long been broken. When the App Store first launched, Apple touted that every developer had a level playing field, however this is no longer the case. The bigger your marketing budget the better your app will do on the App Store," says Hi-Voltage Director Tony Tanevski. "The App Store has many hidden gems that most users never really get to see. We wanted to create a unique and friendly way for users to discover these hidden gems. With Random-Apps users can discover a plethora of great apps that they normally might never have found!" Features: * Discover hundreds of thousands of cool apps * Only the best apps with a 4 or 5-star rating are selected * Apps are shown randomly, without any developer bias * Scroll through a seemingly endless list of great apps * When a user finds a cool app they like, they can share it with their friends * Displays both free and paid apps * Clean, easy-to-use interface While Random-Apps presents apps in a random listing, users do have options to allow them to control what they will be viewing. The app offers the ability to view all types of apps, view only games, or view only apps. If the list of apps for the United States doesn't interest them, a user can tap the App Store option in the Settings menu and set the app to display a random listing of the apps in another country's App Store. Also, Hi-Voltage prides itself on listening to its users, so they've included a handy way to send feedback from directly within the app. "If you're a user that's tired of seeing apps from the same big developers every time you visit the App Store, then you should download Random-Apps today," continues Tony. "Random-Apps is the only way to truly get a unique and fair sampling of the best games and apps that are available in the App Store, and we're proud to offer it free to the iOS user community." Device Requirements: * Compatible with iPhone and iPod touch * Requires iOS 8.3 or later * 4.0 MB Pricing and Availability: Random-Apps 1.0 is free, and is available worldwide exclusively through the App Store in the Reference category.

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software MacBook Pro will Soon Receive its Biggest Update in Years August 12, 2016, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts Useful Tips to Make Your MacBook Pro More User-Friendly GoPro Unveils Telemetric Addition for Footage Captured Through Hero 5 It’s been a while since MacBook Pro has been updated with some heavy features. In fact, over these four years since its arrival, we haven’t seen a single update to the device that has made the MacBook Pro stand apart from its previous versions. But it’s time, says Apple, as the company is now gearing up to put some beefy updates on table for the MacBook Pro. According to Bloomberg, Apple has been testing a new MacBook Pro since the beginning of 2016, and it includes a fresh design that would narrow the thickness of the device noticeably. Along with this comes the trimming of the bezels around the display, which will also yield a smaller frame for the MacBook Pro. The best part of the new MacBook Pro is that it will be replacing the physical function keys on top of the keyboard with a narrow touchscreen OLED display. Basic laptop functions could be controlled using this strip of OLED display. There is no info on what all additional functions and shortcuts Apple will include on the touchscreen. The updated MacBook Pro is also likely to house the Intel Skylake processor that should improve the performance and power consumption of the device. Besides, MacBook Pro is also said to be arriving with the new AMD Polaris GPU. On the outside, MacBook Pro will have its USB ports replaced with USB Type-C ports. This could also replace the MagSafe port and Thunderbolt ports, given that USB-C ports support the Thunderbolt protocol. Despite having the redesign nearly completed for the MacBook Pro, it looks less likely that we will be having the new MacBook Pro launched during their iPhone 7 event scheduled on September 7. Apple could push the launch of upgraded MacBook Pro to October, following which it will be made available on the markets the same month.

The main house on Rana Creek Ranch in Carmel Valley has only one bathroom and two half-bathrooms, but it’s linked via a walkway to a guest wing with two bedrooms and there’s also another two bedrooms in a separate guest house. The working cattle ranch also boasts its own private 2,900 ft landing strip and a lake. It was previously listed for sale in 2013 for $59.95 million, according to the Wall Street Journal. But Markkula, 74, and his wife Linda paid just $8million for the house and 9,000 acres in 1982. ‘We were the first one to look at it and we bought it on the spot,’ he told the Journal. They refurbished the houses over the years, converting one room in the main house into a ‘cowboy bar.’ ‘We’ve enjoyed it, we’ve loved it, but it’s time to move on,’ Markkula added.  Markkula invested in Apple in 1977 after being introduced to Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. He was the company's CEO between 1981 to 1983 and served as chairman from 1985 until 1997.

He would be right, the iPhone 7 is, but it is not the leap of technological advancement that many of the fanboys would have liked or hoped for. Indeed, the iPhone 7 is more the refinement of a phone that is been nine years in the making. But even if Apple is playing it safe, safe is a great place to be. Here's why the iPhone still cuts it in today's market. Apple iPhone 7 review: Similar design with some tweaks The new iPhone might come in a similarly designed chassis to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S models, with the same 4.7-inch screen, but it looks noticeably different thanks to the more subdued antenna lines. Oh, and there are two new finishes - glossy "Jet Black" and matte "Black" - which join the gold, rose gold and silver colour options also available. We have the glossy black model on review, which is a fingerprint-magnet of a model - reminiscent of the iPhone 3G. The deep black colour hides the newly designed antenna incredibly well, while the new finish also makes the transition from metal to glass almost impossible to see. It is "proper shiny". In contrast, the new "regular" black model is more the stealthy option. The finish, which replaces the "Space Gray" option of the previous 6S range, is less likely to be prone to smudges and scratches (those old enough will remember that issue made the iPhone 3G look rather tatty by end of its first year), and it is a much blunter finish compared to the whimsical rose gold and gold options. It is on those models that the new antenna design is more apparent - it now cuts around the top edge of the phone rather than intersecting top and bottom. New finishes aren't the only design changes. The headphones socket has been dumped (yep, no 3.5mm jack here) and replaced with a speaker grille, while the physical Home button has also been changed from a solid state one to one that doesn't move. Apple iPhone 7 review: No headphone socket At the iPhone 7 launch hysteria quickly settled in that Apple had lost the headphone jack and that it would be the end of the world as we know it. Turns out it wasn't, and it makes barely a jot of a difference. Pocket-lint In the iPhone 7's box you get a set of in-ear headphones that connect via the phone's Lightning port instead. If these aren't for you then there are so many brilliant wireless headphones on the market. But we realise that, for some, that might mean the prospect of buying new cans all over again, and sucking up the expense, or using the included adaptor in the box to convert Lightning to 3.5mm. READ: Best Bluetooth headphones 2016: 10 of the best on- and over-ear cans for wireless listening During our testing we've been using the rather controversial-looking but quick-pairing AirPods (which aren't included in the box, they're £159 extra) and a range of other headphones. All work seamlessly. Apple iPhone 7 review: New Home button The iPhone 7's Home button is the part on the phone you probably interact with the most, and upon hearing Apple was ditching the physical "click" element and replacing it with the same technology found in the Apple Watch and MacBook trackpad, we were worried.  In practice, though, it works amazingly well. Like the MacBook trackpad that uses the same technology, you get the feeling that the button is moving when "pressed" - without anything physically moving. Pocket-lint Tap the Home button, and the so-called Taptic Engine inside the phone makes it vibrate gently - making you believe that the button is moving when in reality it isn't. Removing the physical element means there are less parts and less things to "stick". It's all-round neater. The Home button offers three sensitivity settings to make it as responsive as you prefer. It still allows you to flawlessly use it for double-tapping or Touch ID fingerprint recognition. Although Apple says that Touch ID hasn't been upgraded, it feels a lot more responsive to our touch in the iPhone 7 - even with sweaty hands after a run. Once you try it, you'll wonder why Apple hadn't changed the Home button earlier. Apple iPhone 7 review: Water-resistance Apple has made the iPhone 7 water-resistant to a rating of IP67 - meaning it can be immersed in a metre of water for around 30-minutes without drowning. Pocket-lint Yep, dropping your phone down the toilet or in the swimming pool isn't going to be the major headache it once was. We nervously ran ours under the tap and it continued to work just fine. It's not going to allow you to take pictures under water in a pool, because the screen won't necessarily operate properly, but it should protect you from any accidental dunks. Apple iPhone 7 review: Taptic Engine The same Taptic Engine as used to convince you the Home button is physically moving is also used to greater affect across the new iOS 10 user interface. Pocket-lint Playing Codemaster's F1 2016 game, for example, it adds vibrational nuances when crashing into the barriers or going over bumps. Likewise, the rather dull Zombie Gunship showcases the technology too. In both cases it's as if the whole phone is vibrating rather than just a part of it. "Feeling your phone" is going to be a thing now. Apple iPhone 7 review: Stereo sound The space where the headphone socket was in the iPhone 6S is now replaced with a speaker in the iPhone 7, meaning the new phone offers stereo sound from the two speakers at the bottom. There's an extra speaker at the top, too. Pocket-lint The audio enhancements certainly make a difference: the iPhone 7 produces a richer sound that the iPhone 6S. It's not as good as the speaker setup on the iPad Pro, nor will it be loud enough to fill the room with music, but it's ideal for watching a YouTube video or Facebook Live stream around the house (if you're not plugged into the Lightning port or making the most of wireless). Apple iPhone 7 review: Upgraded cameras  The iPhone 7 has a camera update on both the front and back. However, it misses out on the dual-camera offering and wide-angle lens of the iPhone 7 Plus. READ: Apple iPhone 7 Plus dual camera tech explained Pocket-lint Instead the iPhone 7 offers a new 12-megapixel sensor and an improved lens, plus an improved 7-megapixel front-facing camera for FaceTime and selfies. Apple has also added a new flash for better skin tones and plenty of processes in-camera to make sure your photos zing. The camera protrudes out the back of the iPhone 7, just as it has before, and sports a more accentuated circular design - meaning your old cases are unlikely to fit. That's something else for the shopping list. The protrusion is visible, but it's not enough to warrant any concerns and certainly not enough to make the phone wobble when laid on a desk or table. Although you don't get the dual lens technology, the iPhone 7's camera isn't to be sniffed at. It's very good in all situations and noticeably better than the already very good camera on the iPhone 6S. At a team meeting we snapped some side-by-side comparisons to get a closer look and the new camera produced sharper-looking results in all cases. Pocket-lint That's partly thanks to the new f/1.8 aperture lens and the addition of optical image stabilisation (previously OIS was only available on the 6S Plus), but we also suspect a lot of the image processing Apple is able to do with the new more powerful processor on board. The colour in all our test shots looks just natural; the camera auto-detects and handles exposures for different situations well (back-lighting, neon strips, faces, etc); there's detail in the close-up shots we've snapped; and that f/1.8 aperture doesn't overdo things - so further-away subjects remain crisp, while close-up subjects get that lovely blurred background effect. However, we can still see grain in some areas (we're talking when zoomed to 100 per cent) and we've found that images look better on the phone at smaller scale than they do on a larger computer monitor. Some processing does smear away some detail, too, such as the thread in a shirt, as one example. Pocket-lint For those really wanting to take things to the next level, you can now shoot raw, but Apple has held back from adding that capability to its own Camera app, so you'll need a third-party app to get access to that feature. Unlike previous years, there aren't any new camera modes to play with the iPhone 7, and it won't be getting the Portrait mode that the iPhone 7 Plus will be getting later in the year. Apple iPhone 7 review: Speed and performance A new iPhone means upgraded speed. The iPhone 7 gets the new Apple A10 Fusion processor that promises to increase the power and performance over previous models. Pocket-lint Ultimately, it means your phone will be able to load things faster, process things faster, and generally not be in any way sluggish. That's exactly what we've found in our testing to date: games load almost instantly and graphics are rich. The screen - which is the same 4.7-inch size and 1334 x 750 resolution as the iPhone 6S - also feels a lot brighter (it's 25 per cent brighter and comes with a greater colour gamut according to Apple). It's not the Tru Display technology found on the iPad Pro 9.7, though, so no ultra-high resolution to be found here still - but that ought to help battery life. Apple iPhone 7 review: Battery life Apple made a fairly big song and dance over how the battery life had improved for the iPhone 7 following efficiencies in processor and software performance. But we've not really seen those in our tests. After the initial few days using the iPhone 7 and trying to catch-up (the Photos app blasted our battery trying to work out what to do with the 15,000 images we've taken over the years) and we've still not seen the huge improvements promised. Pocket-lint The iPhone 7's battery still lasts a whole day, but it soon drains away - especially if you use social networking or chat apps. A full day in London when using GPS, camera, Slack, Twitter, Facebook, and Mail meant that 13-hours in, by 6pm, we had around 20 per cent battery left. For us that's not improved over our iPhone 6S experience. As always, how you use your phone will determine how long the battery lasts. Play Pokemon Go and you probably won't make it past breakfast, let alone dinner. Apple iPhone 7 review: iOS 10 The new iPhone comes with the latest operating system, iOS 10, as standard. Like the hardware refinements, this new software experience is a subtle change over what users will have seen in iOS 9. iOS 10 comes with a number of new features like a dedicated Home app to allow you to control and manage your HomeKit accessories, a much more advanced Messages app that bring things like apps and stickers, and Widgets to the lock screen so you can quickly grab information snippets from your favourite apps (if they are supported). READ: Apple iOS 10 review: Bringing more complexity and features to your iPhone and iPad The notion that iOS is a simple operating system is now a long and distant memory, given the complexity it opens up for power users. In iOS 10 Apple has focused on layering the experience with even more complexity and depth than ever before. In the same breath, if you're not a phone geek it's still a breeze to use. Verdict The iPhone 7 is not the overhaul that Apple usually presents us with every two years, but there is enough here to keep those upgrading from the iPhone 6 happy. At first glance, however, it's perhaps not the phone to draw in iPhone 6S fans who might be upset that their phone is now old and needs to be replaced - for the iPhone 7 could almost be seen as an "S" version of the iPhone 6S. The removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack may remain briefly controversial, while the odd-looking AirPods (£159) have also raised some eyebrows. But this biggest point of change isn't really going to impact most users as much as it might sound. Ultimately it's the iPhone 7's other, more subtle changes - the new Home button and glossy/matte black finishes with better hidden antennas - that add to the refinement, without tearing up the rule book and starting again. It's also these technologies that continue to ensure the iPhone 7 is a state-of-the-art smartphone. So Tim Cook is right: the iPhone 7 is the company's best iPhone yet. It's just that the best is only slighter better than what we've already had for the past year.

Samsung’s Note 7 steals the thunder from Apple Hindustan Times 12-08-2016 Korean smartphone-maker Samsung might have stolen the limelight with the launch of its new phablet - Galaxy Note 7 - just days ahead of Apple’s annual event which is speculated to be held between September 7 to 12. “Samsung already has an advantage over Apple as consumers are no longer excited about Apple’s new iPhone 7 launch in September. People are only expecting incremental changes in Apple products this year rather than a complete overhaul in the smartphones space,” Tarun Pathak, senior analyst, Counterpoint Research, said adding that Samsung took the lead in sales with changing design aesthetics, camera and the stylus. “Samsung performed way better with the S7 Edge than the normal flat S7 and this goes to show the success of its design,” Pathak said. © Provided by Hindustan Times Samsung on Thursday launched the new Note 7 priced at Rs 59,990 along with two wearables -- Gear Fit 2 for Rs 13,990 and Gear IconX for Rs 13,490 -- and the new Oculus Gear VR which is 23 grams lighter than its predecessor. The Note 7 comes with an octa-core processor, 4GB RAM and 64GB memory expandable to 256 GB. “The water and dust resistant design of Samsung along with its price of Rs 60,000 will help Samsung against Apple, which will be dependent on its huge install base globally to reap profits,” Patak explained adding that history shows that Apple products are steeply priced than any other in the market which might work as a deterrent. According to a report from Strategy Analytics, Apple is loosing marketshare to Google in India as its pie dropped to 2.4 percent in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 4.5 percent in the corresponding period last year. The report also showed that Apple’s iOS fell 35 percent annually and the company just shipped 0.8 million smartphones in India in Q2 2016 compared to 1.2 million during the same period last year. “Apple’s smartphone marketshare has halved from 4 percent to just 2 percent in India during the past year. Apple iOS will need to reduce iPhone pricing to cheaper levels, attract more operator subsidies and enlarge its retail presence through Apple stores or online channels if it wants to regrow significantly in the future,” Woody Oh, director at Strategy Analytics, said. In the September event, Apple is expected to launch a new iPhone, a new Macbook and two watches. Leaked images of Apple’s upcoming flagship smartphone have both models -- iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus -- featuring larger cameras, bigger batteries as compared to their predecessors -- iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. Other changes includes the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack and inclusion of two speaker grills that suggests stereo sound output. However, Faisal Kawoosa, telecom lead at Cybermedia Research thinks that Apple still stands a chance although he said that the price of the new Samsung Note 7 will add potential to the device in terms of sales. “iPhones have a niche and most iPhone users upgrade. However, the last iPhone didn’t do so well in emerging markets for who it was designed. This might be a red flag for the country if it is looking for growth,” Kawoosa explained. Android currently dominates the India market with 97 percent market share followed by iOS at 2.4 percent. “Android dominates the India smartphone market and looks unbeatable right now, due to its deep portfolio of hardware partners, extensive distribution channels, and a wide range of low-cost apps like Gmail,” Neil Mawston, executive director of Strategy Analytics, said.

The timing couldn’t be better, as Apple recently released iOS 9.3.4 and is expected to close the iOS 9.3.3 signing window in the near future. Cydia Eraser for iOS 9.3.3 With Cydia Eraser now in full support of iOS 9.3.3, those who have jailbroken their iOS 9.3.3 devices with Pangu, whether it was with the Chinese Windows jailbreak tool, over the web in the Safari web browser, or with the English Pangu jailbreak tool that utilizes Cydia Impactor, now have a way to remove the jailbreak and put their device back to a stock non-jailbroken installation of iOS 9.3.3. Saurik officially re-branded Cydia Impactor into “Cydia Eraser” last month just before the English Pangu jailbreak tool was released that used an app called “Cydia Impactor” to sign and install an IPA for jailbreaking your device. When the name change occurred, Saurik only noted only partial support for the dated iOS 9.0. So the added support for iOS 9.3.3 this week is very welcoming without a shadow of a doubt. Cydia Eraser effectively removes all traces of the jailbreak you currently have and allows you to restore your device to the firmware it’s already on without having to connect to iTunes to “restore and update” your device. The major benefit to using this tool over iTunes is after you use it, your device can be re-jailbroken on the firmware it’s on if you so desire to try again. This tool is also useful for anyone who has a jailbroken device they’re trying to sell, because it lets the seller sell the device as a “jailbreakable” device, which may add value to it if it gets sold to the right buyer. How it works Cydia Eraser appears to take advantage of the OTA update system. Saurik explains how it works in Cydia, and we’ve included the excerpt below: Eraser uses the firmware archives provided by Apple for its “over the air” update feature. These files are ~2GB large, so Eraser goes to extreme lengths to minimize the amount of data it needs to download: most recoveries will require less than 10MB of transfer. First, the update’s “bill of materials” is compared against the files on your device, generating a list of changes. Then, all files on your device that have been modified or otherwise destroyed are downloaded directly from Apple. In a series of carefully calculated file migrations, all new files are moved to the user partition, and all system data is moved back to the system partition. Up until this point, the idea is that no changes to your system have been made that are “unsafe”: at any point, if Eraser fails/crashes or your device reboots, you can just run it again later. Finally, all of the staged changes to the filesystem are “committed”, all user data is deleted, and iOS is told to run its “reset all content and settings”. The idea is that this “critical window” lasts only the final few seconds of a process that lasts for multiple minutes. (That said, I still highly recommend not at all “messing with” the app while it is running, and maybe if you have a lot of data this will take longer than I expect.) When the device reboots, it will look as it did when you first turned it on; it will also no longer be “jailbroken”: if you want to jailbreak it, you will need to do so using a desktop jailbreaking tool. Simple enough? Well, maybe not for everyone, but to summarize, it’s a very clever tool that exploits the OTA system so that your device gets all the resources it needs to replace the modified files on your device with factory-fresh ones from Apple. As a result, you get a factory-fresh installation of your current iOS version when you run the tool. As a last resort only Cydia Eraser is to be used as a last resort only if you are having trouble with your jailbroken device, such as when you are having frequent stability issues or when you’re absolutely sure you want to sell or re-jailbreak your device. This is because Cydia Eraser effectively erases your files and settings from iOS. When it finishes running, your device will behave just how it did when you pulled it out of the box after buying it. You’ll have to set it up, activate it, and reinstall all your apps and apply all your old settings again manually. When you’re done, you can either put it back in the box to sell, or you can attempt to jailbreak the device again and hope for the best the second time around. Whatever you’re using it for, it works wonders, so if you need to un-jailbreak your device and you don’t want to update the firmware, Cydia Eraser is the way to go. Wrapping up With Cydia Eraser now officially supporting iOS 9.3.3, those who jailbroke with the Pangu jailbreak tool can now un-jailbreak their devices without being prompted to update to iOS 9.3.4 in iTunes. Although iOS 9.3.3 is still being signed as of this writing, Cydia Eraser is the safest way to un-jailbreak your device at this point in time. IF you need to use it, you can download it from Cydia right now. You’ll find it in the Cydia/Telesphoreo repository. Are you excited to finally see iOS 9.3.3 support in Cydia Eraser?

Blip dude No. And if they make the suggestion to update (Best buy tried pulling that crap on me with an an iPod Touch once), just simply say you’ll do it on your own time period. Rowan09 9.3.3 is still being signed? Gabriel Anaya At the moment yes. Anthony Bouchard Yes, for now. mama’s boy Lets say i used cydia eraser and i wanted to update my phone to 9.3.4 how am i supposed to do that? Joshua The-Legend Wiebe Does this support the latest devices? Anthony Bouchard Yes diggitydang Does this work on 9.0.2? I think I’m staying downgraded but want this ability to unjailbreak at this version. Anyone know? Guilherme  Yes, according to the source. diggitydang Cool, thanks! Tom M Will this work if i updated to 9.3.3. over the air before? I went from 9.3.2 to 9.3.3 OTA, and then jailbreaked. will cydia eraser cause any trouble, or will i have a “fresh” 9.3.3.? Anthony Bouchard It doesn’t matter how you updated. David Gow Sweet. Thanks AndreG Same question just confirming. I’m currently on 9.0.2, and have some issues, can I use cydia eraser for a fresh start and re-jailbreak staying on 9.0.2 and will it work. Anthony Bouchard Saurik said it works for iOS 7.1-9.3.3. 9.0.2 falls in between, so I assume yes, but no guarantees. AndreG Thanks Anthony nova voter Is there a tutorial on iDB for how to backup and restore JUST iMessages/SMS? I like to do clean restores, but I dont want to lose my messages. the only “normal” way to do it is through a full restore from backup which I don’t want to do. I used to have a link to a good guide on which files to save and put back, and how to change the security settings after putting them back on the restored phone, but I can’t find it. Anthony Starr So do I install it now from Cydia, and sit on it as a “just in case” tool that is in my settings? Or does it begin erasing immediately after install? This isn’t clear. Rei That’s what I want to know! Ghaith Al Hami i used it and now am stuck at the icloud activation screen Dplumber I recently jailbroke my phone with pangu.

Used with permission MediaTek has revealed an upcoming Helio X30 system-on-chip (SoC) that will likely be one of the first 10nm fabricated SoCs to arrive when it ships in mid-2017. The deca-core mobile SoC will also be one of the first to use ARM’s new Cortex-A73 successor to the Cortex-A72, according to PhoneRadar, which based its story in part on an EETimes China interview [translated] with MediaTek CTO Zhu Shangzu. Manufactured using TSMC’s 10nm FinFET process, the mobile-focused Helio X30 has a tri-cluster design with two 2.8GHz, Cortex-A73 based “Artemis” cores, as well as four 2.2GHz Cortex-A53 cores and four 2.0GHz Cortex-A35 cores. The X30 also sports the high-end, quad-core PowerVR 7XT GPU, which is capable of driving VR headsets, says PhoneRadar. The Helio X30 will support up to 8GB of LPDDR4 RAM and is powerful enough to drive a 26-megapixel rear-facing camera, as well as a front-facing cam. The SoC is said to support UFS 2.1 storage, as well as a three carrier aggregation (3CA) modem that supports the speedy CAT 12 LTE standard. MediaTek’s latest SoC follows its similarly 10-core, but 20nm fabricated Helio X20 and X25. These SoCs debuted the tri-cluster concept, but use only two architectures as opposed to three with the X30. The X20 and X25 have two Cortex-A72 cores and two quad-core banks of Cortex-A53 cores with different clock rates. The Helio X25, which is exclusive to the Android-based Meizu Pro 6 smartphone, clocks the Cortex-A72 cores higher to 2.5GHz instead of 2.3GHz and has a faster 850MHz version of the Mali T880 MP4 GPU. Cortex-A73 cores should provide a 30 percent better sustained performance and efficiency than Cortex-A72, claims ARM, which is in the process of being acquired by SoftBank. The tiny, 0.65 x 0.65mm design, which has been licensed by HiSilicon and Marvell, in addition to MediaTek, features an Artemis microarchitecture borrowed from the rarely used Cortex-A17 chip. Artemis emphasizes “sustained performance,” which means that mobile devices can maintain peak performance for longer periods before being forced to throttle down due to heat buildup. The Helio X30 also features power-efficient Cortex-A35 cores for its low-end cluster. According to ARM, Cortex-A35 draws about 33 percent less power per core and occupies 25 percent less silicon area, compared to Cortex-A53. The -A35 is not as power efficient as the new, IoT-focused Cortex-A32, which is slower, but smaller and more efficient. Cortex-A32 is the first ARMv8 chip that works only in 32-bit mode. Coming Up: Apple A10 and Snapdragon 821 According to PhoneRadar, the Helio X30 won’t ship for another year, either at the end of the second quarter or the beginning of the third. A lot can happen in that time, including the upcoming Apple A10 due in the iPhone 7, which is said to be fabricated at 10nm as well. The latest rumors has Apple sticking with two Cortex-A72 or -A73-like cores, following the minimalist design of the dual-core, 16nm Apple A9/A9X. Previously, the A10 was rumored to have between three and six cores. In AnTuTu benchmarks the dual-core Apple A9 has beat most other Android-targeted mobile SoCs with many more cores. The A9 was edged out only by Qualcomm’s quad-core, 14nm Snapdragon 820, which has four Cortex-A72 like “Kyro” cores, although the 14nm, octa-core Samsung Exynos 8890 was close behind. In other benchmarks, the A9 has beaten the Helio X20 and X25. It’s unclear whether Apple has proven that high core counts don’t matter or whether Big.Little dual- and tri-cluster SoC designs have yet to evolve to their full potential. Battery life and other considerations are also important. It remains to be seen how these complex multi-core designs are following through on promises to offer smoother transitions between operation modes like high-power video and VR, standard text and voice, and sleep/idle. Meanwhile, with the move to VR and augmented reality, GPUs are becoming almost as important as CPUs. Indeed Imagination’s PowerVR 7XT is expected to beat out the the Helio X20’s ARM Mali GPU in high-end gaming. MediaTek cares more about competition on high-end Android devices than it does about Apple. Principally, this comes down to Qualcomm and Samsung, with upstarts like Kirin advancing from below. Qualcomm recently introduced a modest upgrade to the Snapdragon 820 called the Snapdragon 821. Due to arrive in devices later this year, the SoC is claimed to offer 10 percent faster performance and provide better battery life than the 820. Intel’s Kaby Lake Stays at 14nm If all had gone according to plan it would be Intel, not MediaTek, announcing the first 10nm processor this month. Last month, Intel began shipping its seventh-generation Kaby Lake core processors, but with few details. We do know that the 7th Gen Core CPUs, which were originally meant to debut a 10nm process, will instead stick with the same 14nm process used by the sixth-gen Skylake and fifth-gen Broadwell chips. Intel’s ditching of its traditional “tick-tock” product release cadence is a sign that the Moore’s Law pace of chip miniaturization is slowing. Still Intel’s 10nm “Cannonlake” is expected in 2017, and on the ARM side, TSMC is already working on a 7nm process. The actual transistor density of the 7nm design is expected to be very similar to the 10nm Intel process, however. Meanwhile, Kaby Lake should offer incremental performance improvements over Skylake while squashing some of the bugs that have nipped at Skylake’s heels. We’ll find out more next week at the Intel Developer Forum. One thing Kaby Lake won’t be is a mobile processor, unless you count high-end tablets and all-in-ones. Intel appears to have dropped future development on its 14nm “Cherry Trail” Atom SoCs, which failed to win over many phone vendors, although more embedded-oriented SoCs like the “Braswell” Celeron, Pentium, and Atom x5-e8000 continue to do well.

TAIWAN RECOMMENDED MOST READ RECENT COMMENTS MOST COMMENTED NEWS SECTIONS TOP STORIES TAIWAN CHINA BUSINESS WORLD ASIA SPORTS EDITORIAL COMMENTARY LIFE HEALTH MOVIES ART & LEISURE CLOSE TAB Site Search Submit SEARCH BY DATE CLOSE TAB Text Size Small Medium Large CLOSE TAB Shares end down but recoup part of earlier losses Tweet SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     CNA August 12, 2016, 12:31 am TWN TAIPEI--Shares in Taiwan closed lower Thursday at a time of concern over stiff technical resistance after a recent strong showing, but the weighted index recovered part of its earlier losses in late-session bargain hunting, dealers said. <a href="http://ax-d.pixfuture.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=fb1025fdcc&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"><img src="http://ax-d.pixfuture.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=537134883&cs=fb1025fdcc&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> The bellwether electronics sector led the downturn, with selling focusing on Apple concept stocks after a research report said that Apple Inc. has pressured component suppliers to cut prices, the dealers said. Market sentiment was also hurt by sales reports released by contract chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC, 台積電) and contract electronics supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (鴻海) that disappointed the market, while selling in select financial stocks also pushed down the broader market, they added. The weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange closed down 68.59 points, or 0.75 percent, at 9,131.83, after moving between 9,063.81 and 9,187.18, on turnover of NT$92.44 billion (US$1.95 billion). Knee-jerk Reaction to a Weaker Wall Street The market opened down 0.34 percent in a knee-jerk reaction to a weaker Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.20 percent and the S&P 500 index ended 0.29 percent lower on a fall in international crude oil prices overnight, the dealers said. Selling on the local main board escalated, sending the weighted index to the day's low, with Apple suppliers in focus. Investors took cues from a research report about lower prices the U.S. consumer electronics giant paid to these suppliers, and some bargain hunters then turned active, which helped the broader market climb from the low by the end of the session, they said. “The main board breached the 9,200-point level a day earlier, a target many investors had previously set,” KGI Securities analyst Phil Chu said. “It was understandable that these investors tended to pocket their profits and run today.” Chu said that investors used the research report released by U.S.-based RBC Capital Markets about Apple's move to seek discounts from its suppliers as a reason to cut their holdings in Apple concept stocks throughout the session. According to the report, Apple has been pushing for price reductions from a number of its suppliers in a bid to take on foreign exchange losses and maintain its gross margin. Apple Concept Stocks Among the Apple concept stocks, smartphone camera lens maker Largan Precision Co.(大立光) fell 1.83 percent to close at NT$3,750.00 but remained the most expensive stock in Taiwan, while Catcher Technology Co. (可成) lost 1.87 percent to end at NT$209.50. Hon Hai, an assembler of iPhones and iPads, dropped 0.56 percent to close at NT$89.50, after the manufacturer reported lower-than-expected sales for July, but the stock recovered from an early low of NT$88.40. TSMC, the most heavily weighted stock in the local equity market, shed 1.67 percent to end at NT$176.50, also due to market disappointment over its July sales. Led by TSMC's losses, the bellwether electronics sector closed down 1.05 percent, and the semiconductor sub-index ended down 1.30 percent. The Financial Sector In the financial sector, which closed 0.64 percent lower, Cathay Financial Holding Co. (國泰金) fell 1.05 percent to end at NT$37.60, and Fubon Financial Holding Co. (富邦金) lost 1.07 percent to close at NT$41.55. Bucking the downturn on the broader market, food maker Uni-President Enterprises Corp. (統一) rose 0.63 percent to end at NT$64.20, and Eclat Textile Co. (儒鴻) gained 6.03 percent to close at NT$387.00. “Despite the fall by the close, the index came off an early low by recovering more than half of its earlier losses, which means that some investors remained willing to hunt bargains,” Chu said. “I remain upbeat about the market movement in the near future and believe an uptrend will continue after the current volatility, since the main board has been awash in liquidity with no signs of any immediate withdrawal by foreign investors,” Chu said. He added that whenever the index falls and moves closer to the strong technical support level at around 9,050 points, investors could find a good buying moment.

I thought there were a few too many – that it was a bit too complicated to have various (differing) lists of Apple products in various locations. Well, I didn’t know the half of it. After I wrote the article, I heard from readers of a few other places to find some of the same lists, and some different lists, of your associated Apple devices. To recap: you can view your total iTunes authorisations in iTunes (Account > View my Account), and see a list of devices connected to iTunes in the Cloud by clicking the Manage Devices link on that screen. You can also go to appleid.apple.com and see a list of devices associated with your Apple ID, including their serial numbers. But that’s not all. Apple Support Profile A page I didn’t mention is the Apple Support Profile, which has a much friendlier interface. Rather than being tied into your Apple ID, though, it appears to be connected to your Apple purchase history. My wife’s watch, which I bought (but is associated with her Apple ID) appears on my own Support Profile page. Some products I did buy from Apple, like my fourth-generation Apple TV, don’t show up at all. It’s hardly a canonical list. My Support Profile is also littered with old products that I don’t have anymore – hi there, original AirPort Base Station! – but unlike some of the other lists Apple provides, this page is quite customisable. It’s easy to remove products from the page, and you can also add products that don’t appear for whatever reason. From this page, you can also set a phone number to be your designated ‘VoicePass’ number, meaning that Apple will be able to pull up your Apple support information automatically when you call an Apple support phone number. The Apple Support Profile page has a whole lot of stuff in it, and it’s worth knowing about. But it did a bad job of displaying all the devices currently associated with my Apple ID – it just doesn’t seem to have access to that data – and also offered a scattershot view into all the other Apple purchases I’ve made over the years. iCloud Settings One list I failed to mention is perhaps the easiest way for anyone on an iOS device to get a list of their iCloud-associated devices, and it’s right inside the Settings app. Tap iCloud, then your name and picture at the very top of the iCloud menu, and then tap Devices. You’ll see a list of devices currently logged into to iCloud. Tap on any device to see more detailed information and get an option to remove it from your list. (If it’s still actively connected to iCloud, it will reappear automatically.) So far as I can tell, this is the same list that’s displayed on the Apple ID web page. TestFlight I tried to install a beta version of an app using Apple’s TestFlight utility the other day, and was told that I had associated too many devices with my Apple ID! This isn’t an error that most people will see, but if you beta-test software you may run into it. I had to tap on my Apple ID at the bottom of the TestFlight app to open the app’s settings screen, which displays a list of devices that are attached to your Apple ID for TestFlight purposes. Fortunately, it’s easy to remove devices from this screen just by tapping the Edit button, selecting all my old devices, and deleting them. Find My Friends In Find My Friends, if you tap on your own name at the bottom of the screen, you’ll be given options about which device you’d like to use to share your location for your Apple ID. This appears to be an entirely different list of devices! In my case, many of the devices listed here (by name only) were old iPad minis I haven’t owned for ages. I have no idea where this list comes from, but you can delete items from this list by swiping from right to left and tapping on the Delete button. Mysteries of Apple Between the Apple ID page and the iCloud area of the Settings app, it seems like Apple is slowly gathering its associated services and devices lists in one central location. There are a whole lot of outliers still remaining, but the direction seems positive. And the Apple Support Profile, while scattershot, can be made into a useful directory of every Apple product you own – if you put in a little work to curate it, adding devices here and deleting them there.

Thursday, August 11, 2016 [Tweets] [Favorites] Emoji in iOS 10 and Sierra Apple: More than one hundred new and redesigned emoji characters will be available to iPhone and iPad users this fall with iOS 10. This exciting update brings more gender options to existing characters, including new female athletes and professionals, adds beautiful redesigns of popular emoji, a new rainbow flag and more family options. Benjamin Mayo: The emoji depicting people and faces now use a new gradient style to give them a visual refresh. The default yellow face emoji now look more artistic and less like ‘Simpsons’. In fact, they look more like traditional emoticons from chatrooms. Glenn Fleishman: The new public betas now include 10 additional families: every combination of single mom and single dad with one and two children across gender binaries. I’m not sure what families with more than two children use for emoji, but there you go—these are both symbolic and concrete at once. Technically, these new families involve coding of combinations of emoji using Zero Width Joiners (ZWJs), which Jason explains in detail in his column. When you open an iOS Pages document containing the new families using El Capitan, those combos are revealed, such as a woman, a boy, and a girl instead of the all-in-one single mom plus one boy and girl emoji. Apple has also added gender variants for all sports and professions in which a male or ostensibly non-gendered figure was provided before. There’s now a basketball player with cropped hair and one with a ponytail and the slighest suggestion of breasts. For swimmers, the male and female differ between a partial unclothed male torso and a swimsuit on the female version. […] Now, Apple hasn’t gone that far. It’s still in the hills above the uncanny valley. But compare the before and after faces, and you’ll see a more definitive expression than the previous drawings. The emoji look like someone specific, instead of a generic impression. (The new “woman” emoji looks eerily similar to a tech reporter friend; I shared it with her and she agreed.) Jeremy Burge (via Jason Snell, Hacker News): Pistol emoji has changed from a realistic-looking gun in iOS 9.3 to a bright green toy water gun in the iOS 10 beta. In the history of running Emojipedia, I have never seen an emoji change so poorly received. […] If Apple goes ahead with this change in the public iOS 10 release, one person could innocently tweet a toy and have that be seen by others as a weapon. […] All other vendors display this emoji as a real gun. teddyh: The unicode code chart actually says “PISTOL = handgun, revolver”, and the reference glyph (with a larger version on page 4) is pretty clearly a Beretta M9. John Gruber: Intriguingly, Microsoft is switching their pistol emoji from a toy sci-fi ray guy to a realistic revolver. And Ben Sandofsky argues that the new emoji should be a variant, not a replacement, to avoid the ambiguity of the glyph conveying a very different meaning depending on the recipient’s OS. Benjamin Mayo (tweet): With previous iOS versions, Apple presented this emoji as an actual gunmetal pistol. With iOS 10, they’ve changed it to a green toy water gun. I don’t like how they have handled this. This has nothing to do with the associated political implications of free speech and everything to do with the way Apple has implemented this technically. My personal qualm is that Apple has distorted the integrity of the Emoji language by replacing the glyph for a character which has a very different meaning. A toy water gun depicts very different intentions than a real gun. John Gruber: While I’m on it, I’ve heard from a little birdie that Apple’s new water pistol glyph was in fact changed from left-pointing to right-pointing, but only in internal-to-Apple builds of iOS. The idea was to make the water pistol pair well with the “splashing sweat” symbol, which to date has been rendered left-to-right. But because flipping the gun direction changes the meaning when it’s paired with any other emoji to its left, it was decided that it would be easier to flip the direction of the splashing emoji and leave the pistol left-pointing. If Apple does change the splash direction, it will also pair better with the much-beloved eggplant. Carl Franzen: In this case, the change to the squirt gun emoji comes nearly a year after a social media campaign called #DisarmTheiPhone was launched by advocacy group New Yorkers Against Gun Violence, with the goal of pressuring Apple to drop support for the revolver emoji. Previously, Apple was reported to have pressured the emoji masters of the universe —the Unicode consortium, an international standards body — to drop plans to add a rifle emoji to the set. Jason Snell: There are now around a thousand base emojis and tens of thousands of variations. One day, in a dark mood, I wondered: What are the least-loved emojis? I checked out the live stats on emojitracker.com and asked Jeremy Burge of Emojipedia for his site’s least-favorite emojis. The result is this list: The world’s least-loved emojis. Stephanie Studer (via Hacker News): Kim Uryong, a professor of communication at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul, says emoji are South Korea’s “third language” (after Korean and English) – worthy, he thinks, of their own dictionary. […] Stickers give cadence and character, punch-lines and punctuation, to South Korean text-speak. They act as qualifiers that inflect words with humour or sadness; they also establish an intimacy that most would shy away from in face-to-face dialogue. Many appeal for forgiveness. A dog called Frodo, one of KakaoTalk’s signature characters, proffers a bouquet of roses on one knee while perspiring. […] Emoji in South Korea and Japan tend towards over-dramatisation, irony and self-mockery. They appeal not just to the young but also to middle-aged office workers looking to smooth awkward or delicate situations with bosses, colleagues and family members. One sticker set revolves around “Salaryman Mr Ho”, who veers between slumping over his desk from exhaustion surrounded by energy drinks, spinning gleefully in the CEO’s chair, and crying with rage. Kim’s recent hits include a crotchety grandmother who curses a lot – a softer way for chat-app users to swear in front of their elders – and a loving father-daughter set in which the girl gently admonishes her dad. Kim says wives use such stickers to show their disapproval of their husbands’ behaviour – when they’ve been out drinking late, for example. See also: Hacker News. Update (2016-08-13): Becky Hansmeyer: As I seek to understand more about the popularity of stickers in messaging apps (hint: they’re more than just big emoji!), I thought I’d share some of the interesting articles I’ve come across. Update (2016-08-15): Pierre Lebeaupin: When I first heard of the change, I was already skeptical, and after pondering it some more, I have reason to think the benefits are not worth the costs. To begin with, by doing it this way Apple makes the change retroactive. Any piece of text (email, text message, blog post, article, photo caption, or of course tweet) with a pistol emoji has now had its meaning retroactively changed when viewed on the latest iOS 10 beta. This change does not just affect newly received messages: any time the pistol emoji was used in the last few years will be affected by this change. It’s not clear to me that there even is a benefit. I suppose the idea is that Apple, the company that made the 1984 ad, thinks that Newspeak emoji would reduce real-world violence. I’m not aware of any evidence that would support that hypothesis, and any potential effect might actually be reversed by the ambiguity the change introduces with other platforms.

It was rumored that the next version of the wearable would be unveiled at WWDC 2016, but the event didn’t bring any updates. However, a new report from KGI Securities analytst Ming-Chi Kuo, obtained by AppleInsider, sheds some light on the second coming of the Apple Watch. It’s slated to arrive later this year, along with an updated version of the original. TNW Answers Your questions answered by founders, experts and thought leaders in business, design and tech. Join a chat The Apple Watch 2 is said to share the same design as its predecessor, but will get a GPS radio and barometer for improved geolocation capabilities. It’ll also have a larger battery to better support the new components – but its bulk will prevent Apple from slimming the new watch’s profile. The other addition to the lineup will be an iterative upgrade from the first Apple Watch – bringing improved intervals like a faster 16nm processor from TSMC and enhanced waterproofing. We also heard rumors earlier this year about LTE support coming to the Apple Watch. Kuo expects that to arrive only in 2017, which means you won’t see a model capable of receiving phone calls and data on its own this year. A redesign of the wearable may only happen in 2018. If that’s all that Apple can bring to the table in the next couple of years, I can’t say I’m excited by the prospect of a new Apple Watch. The predicted future versions only list incremental improvements in features – but nothing revolutionary. Similarly, there isn’t any mention of a major increase in battery life, which is a bummer given that the current version runs out of power in a day. That doesn’t mean that people won’t buy the next Apple Watch, of course. But if Kuo’s right about the upcoming models, Apple will once again miss an opportunity in 2016 to make smartwatches the norm for tech enthusiasts.

A star rating system isn’t new and we’ve seen this applied to various rating systems for movies, video games, and so on. However could it be that Apple has decided that maybe they don’t want to rely on the star system anymore? As spotted by Kirkville, in iTunes 12.5 and iOS 10, there does not appear to be the option to give star ratings anymore. In iTunes 12.5, users can still enable the star rating system, although it is no longer there by default, suggesting that Apple could be trying to phase it out. On iOS 10, it is a different story as the star system is gone completely. In a way this makes sense. With Apple Music, Apple gave users the option of liking a song by giving it a “heart”. As per our previous report, iTunes 12.5 also introduced the ability to “dislike” a song, meaning that when it comes to rating a song, it’s a more binary process of either you like it or you dislike it, versus the star system where a 4/5 could mean you like it, but maybe not as much as a 5/5, or maybe a little bit more than a 3/5. A binary system would make it easier for Apple Music’s recommendation algorithm to decide what songs you do or do not like.

SCOUT Share & Embed Odell Beckham shows Eli Apple tricks of trade Larry Stansbury 08/11/2016 The rookie cornerback is learning the nuances of his position from none other than Odell Beckham Jr. Eli Apple’s Thoughts about the Preseason Game This Friday and JPP             This Friday is the preseason debut for Eli Apple and he couldn't be more stocked. The New York Giants cornerback had to play against Odell Beckham Jr. during training camp and wow, did he take him back to school. You can tell Apple has learned so much for going against his teammate.             “He has taught me how to read routes better and he will tell me things from a receiver perspective, like what receivers look for and little things like that, so he can help me out with just the top of the route stuff.” Apple said during a media session. “He has really been on me about and just telling me to trust my talent and get my head around. Little things like that we have been talking about all the time, so he has been helping me out a lot actually.”             During the play, Apple has improved himself as a cornerback by prepping during practice and now after repetition, it has come naturally for him. After playing against Beckham Jr., he is fully equipped and now privy tor all Beckham’s tricks on the field. Beckham is not the only player that Apple has admired, Jason Pierre-Paul is the unquestioned leader on the defense.             “He is an energizer bunny out there on the field. He is the one that is always bringing the energy. Even on walkthroughs, he is going full speed. He is a funny guy off the field and he is definitely the man around here, so I am just trying to pick up everything from him that he tells me to do, and I just make sure to do it full speed like him.”             You can tell that the camp is really wraps up for the players and they are continuing to develop themselves for Friday’s game. There are ready for Friday’s preseason game.             “Yeah, I think everybody wants to do well. Of course, it is preseason, everybody is going to be watching, it is the first real live action when you can hit somebody, so I am interested. Of course, it is football, it is something you have done your entire life and you just want to play well.”    Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Updated Scout 300 Trend Meter For 2017 Beyond the Boxscore: Giants 22 Bears 16 Final Talib's Return Will Spark Denver's Defense RG3 back on the field Williams Looking Forward to Iron Bowl The Giants Beat Top Stories Beyond the Boxscore: Giants 22 Bears 16 Final While most fans had their eyes on the boxscore following the game, the Giants Beat digs a little deeper to reveal the variables and factors that dictated the outcome in Week 11. by Alex Evans The Giants BeatYesterday at 4:31 PM Unheralded Heroes: Week 11 Edition The Giants Beat covers the players whose contributions were overlooked during Sunday's win. by Sara Eljouzi The Giants BeatYesterday at 4:12 PM What We Learned: Giants 22 Bears 16 Final The Giants Beat recaps the major takeaways from the Giants narrow win over the Bears. by Scott Thompson The Giants BeatMonday at 1:18 PM FOX Sports Radio: The Giants BeatThe Giants Beat publisher hosted a two-hour FOX Sports Radio show in New Jersey talking about the Giants and the rest of the NFL. by Staff The Giants BeatMonday at 12:44 PM Game Balls and Goats: Week 11 Edition The NY Giants have won their fifth straight game with a 22-16 victory over the Chicago Bears at MetLife Stadium. by Sara Eljouzi The Giants BeatSunday at 2:45 PM Fantasy Slant: Week 11 Recap The New York Giants improved to 7-3 on the season, winning a 22-16 squeaker in windy conditions at MetLife stadium.

About Portfolio Photos Blog Pico Facebook Twitter Tumblr Instagram RSS Should Apple Buy Netflix? Posted August 11, 2016 by Om Malik I was on Leo Laporte’s TWIT show yesterday and ended up going on a bit of a rant about Apple and “Planet of the Apps.” My view on “content” efforts like this is pretty simple. It is distracting, non-core to Apple and basically avoids the bigger challenges: how to add data and Internet DNA into a company that has managed to struggle with services. The App Store needs more smarts and better search, and it needs to take a contemporary, data-centric approach to surfacing apps. “Planet of the Apps” is just an old media-like thinking applied to “apps.” I might be the only one who feels that way, but the reality is that these kinds of efforts are really not good for Apple at a time when it is competing with Google, Amazon and Facebook. Apple—if it really wants to get into content and wants to make a strong statement to the Hollywood establishment that has stymied its television efforts so far—should make a big, bold bet. It should use its massive stock market capitalization and cash hoard to buy Netflix. Apple is currently valued at $584 billion and it can afford Netflix, which is valued at around $42 billion. This is a way better use of its financial resources than spending $58 billion on stock buybacks over the next two years. Apple already has spent $117 billion on stock buybacks since 2012 and given out $46 billion in dividends. That is more than enough to buy Tesla. What does Apple get with Netflix? It gets a large library, and a company that has presence on all major platforms and has partnered with most (if not all) major entertainment hardware makers and is well represented in the Android ecosystem. It has established relationships with top broadband providers and has a big infrastructure to support its nearly 83 million subscribers. It already is an established brand—but most importantly, it brings some much-needed Internet DNA into Apple. Netflix’s engineering and cloud teams are amongst the best in the business and have contributed to the modern cloud movement. In more ways than one, they could help add the vital Internet and cloud DNA to Apple, which seems to be fairly serious about its services business. Like this: Like Loading...

Ben Estep (XMFShazam) Aug 11, 2016 at 7:23PM Source: Fitbit Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) is the world's leading tech wearables company and continues to grow at a rapid pace. Despite their industry standing, the company's stock price has sharply declined over the last year, down over 50% from its 52-week high of $45.25, due to concerns over growing competition and its future growth and profitability. I think the market's concerns over Fitbit's future are overblown and, with the stock close to its all-time lows, I recently bought it at what I thought was an attractive price with plans to hold for several years. The Market Share Leader Competition in the wearables space has heated up over the last several years with the arrival of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch, Xiaomi's Mi Band and many fitness tracking devices launched by smaller companies. Even with growing competition, Fitbit remained the dominant player with 24.5% of market share in the first quarter of 2016 . The closest competitors were Xiaomi, with 19% market share, and Apple, with 7.5% market share. It's important to note there are vast differences between the product mix offered by each of these companies. Source: IDC Worldwide Quarterly Wearables Tracker Apple offers two products, the Watch, prices range from $549 to $1099, and the recently launched Watch Sport, prices range from $299 to $349 . Xiaomi's only fitness tracking device is the Mi Band, which is priced at $14.99 , and offers limited features compared to Fitbit and Apple. Fitbit differentiates its product assortment from Apple and Xiaomi in several key ways, which should help it retain its market share. First, it currently offer 8 products, ranging from simple tracking devices to smartwatches. Fitbit's newer products provide continuous heart-rate monitoring, on-screen workouts, connected GPS, automatic sleep tracking, and more. It's newest product, Blaze, provides similar functionality to the Apple Watch, but costs $100 less and has a battery that lasts five days versus Apple Watch's 18 hours of life.  Second, its products' prices range from $59.95 to $249.95, occupying a price niche between its two closest competitors. Finally, Fitbit is accessible on 200+ phones, including Android, iOS and Windows operating systems – more than any other fitness tracker on the market.   Plenty of Room to Grow There have been growing concerns that the market for fitness bands and tracking devices is reaching saturation, but there's evidence that the category (and the value of Fitbit's share of it) has plenty of room to grow. According to IDC, a global provider of market intelligence, worldwide shipments of wearables are expected to reach 101.9 million units by the end of 2016 and continue growing at a compound annual growth rate of 20.3% over the next 4 years. IDC expects 213.6 million units in the wearables category to be shipped in 2020. This estimate includes clothing and eyewear, but watches and wristbands should still be major categories with an expected 80% share of the wearables units shipped in 2020.  Fitbit proved it can continue to create popular products with the success of the recently launched Blaze and Alta, which accounted for 54% of the company's revenue in the second quarter of 2016. I think Fitbit could remain the market share leader over the next several years as they continue launching new devices, which should allow them to maintain their share, or even capture more of the quickly growing wearables market. Building A Social Experience Fitbit's competitive advantage isn't limited to product features -- the company's apps and social experience create a powerful network effect. According to Fitbit CEO James Park: The robust social experience in the Fitbit app is another key part of our success, and it's created a competitive mode supported by the network effect of our large active user community. We believe people are more likely to buy a Fitbit over a competitor, because their friends and family are more likely to be already participating in the Fitbit social experience.  By year-end 2015, active users in the app increased 152% year over year, with 16.9 million active users out of 29 million registered device users. The company also added 1,000 Fitbit Wellness enterprise customers, who traditionally have purchased large quantities of devices or subsidized employee purchases through discounts and encouraged active use.   Attractive Valuation The price-to-sales ratio, or P/S ratio, is a valuation measure calculated by dividing a company's market cap by its revenue. It could be an indicator a company is undervalued when compared to company's in a similar industry. Forward price-to-earnings, or forward P/E, is another valuation measure calculated by dividing the stock price by analyst estimates of future earnings per share. In the most recent quarter, Fitbit had a P/S ratio of 1.51 and forward P/E of 13.24, compared to 2.85 and 18.65 for the S&P Information Technology Index. Potential Acquisition Target That attractive valuation, plus the fact that the company has no long-term debt, is experiencing rapid revenue growth (46.5% YOY in last quarter), and has plenty of cash ($535 million), means Fitbit could become an acquisition target. In the past, Apple, Garmin, Samsung, and Under Armour had been mentioned as potential acquirers. Fitbit has significantly increased R&D and SG&A expenses over the last several years and an acquirer could realize substantial cost savings by cutting from these areas, making the acquisition more attractive. I didn't invest expecting an acquisition, but I'm not ruling out the possibility. As I stated earlier, I think a lot of the market's concerns over Fitbit's future growth are overblown. Fitness tracking devices and wearables will continue to be an extremely competitive market, but I think Fitbit is positioned to continue leading the category. Ben Estep owns shares of Fitbit.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 12 August 2016 | MYT 6:00 AM Apple's baby iPhone is hitting the sweet spot with consumers Little wonders: Apple's iPhone SE saw a successful second quarter in the US and in five European countries. — AFP Relaxnews Many in the tech community questioned Apple's logic in unveiling a new iPhone with a 4in screen when the rest of the industry is making smartphones that are bigger than tablets, but the iPhone SE is proving a hit, particularly in Europe. According to Kantar Worldpanel, whose research is based on responses from a worldwide panel of consumers, the proportion of people plumping for a new iOS handset rather than an Android in the US and in Europe's five main countries, has jumped noticeably over the past three months. Just under one-third (31.8%) of US smartphone sales were of the iOS variety while 18.2% of consumers in the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Italy also went for an iPhone. "In Great Britain, the iPhone SE was the top selling device in the quarter at 9.2%, followed by the iPhone 6s at 9.1%," said Dominic Sunnebo, business unit director for Kantar Worldpanel ComTech Europe. But as well as being a standout hit in the UK, Apple's smallest current handset is proving a global hit, behind only the iPhone 6s/6s Plus and the Samsung Galaxy S7/S7 Edge in terms of sales. "The iPhone SE became the third best-selling phone at 5.1%, contributing to the overall growth of iOS during the period," said Lauren Guenveur, consumer insight director for Kantar Worldpanel ComTech. However, while Apple has taken another small bite out of Android's market share in the US and Europe, its popularity is waning in China and Japan. "In contrast to the growth in the US and EU5, iOS continued to post year-over-year declines in Urban China," said Tamsin Timpson, Strategic Insight Director at Kantar Worldpanel ComTech Asia. "While the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus remain the top selling smartphones in the region, pressure from Huawei's Mate 8, P9, Xiaomi's RedMi Note 3 and Mi 5, and Oppo's R7 has led to increased competition in the market." However, Kantar notes that sales of the iPhone SE were restricted in the region over the last quarter. "[It] was not able to make the expected impact, accounting for 2.5% of smartphone sales in the second quarter," said Timpson. —  AFP Relaxnews You May Be Interested Mobile vending machines bring Snap Spectacles to NY customers Yew Sin-Ee Yi continue fine run in Hong Kong Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Fraud in Felda Global Ventures Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Others Also Read Store offers RM5 promo on 100 products to further stretch ringgit M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Japan enlists Sailor Moon to promote safe sex advertisement Latest News Philippines money laundering body charges bankers for ignoring cyberheist Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Most Viewed in Tech Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Viral video will crash your iPhone The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Israeli firm can steal phone data in seconds Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Pokémon Go says thanks and reshuffles CP Watch your self-ie!

Developers are now permitted to add previously unheard-of capabilities to Phone using Apple’s new application programming interface (API), called CallKit, allowing Voice over IP (VoIP) calls from apps like Skype and WhatsApp to behave like cellular calls. CallKit-enabled apps put contact images on the Lock screen for incoming VoIP calls and are deeply integrated with Contacts and Phone’s Recents and Favorites. Phone on iOS 10 packs in other exciting improvements that we honestly started to believe would never get implemented on the iOS platform, like voicemail transcription à la Google Voice and third-party extensions for detecting spammy calls automatically. So let’s get to it… Video hands-on: new iOS 10 features for the Phone app In addition to much tighter VoIP integration than before, iOS 10’s Phone can ask a third-party app to verify if an incoming call is possibly spam. People cards in Contacts have been revamped with blue buttons for calling people via VoIP apps of your choice and your voicemails are now available as speech-to-text transcriptions. After testing some of the above enhancements, our video editor Andrew O’Hara has put together a quick video walkthrough for those of you who may not have enough time to read through the whole article. The video runs two minutes and 21 seconds long. If you don’t see the embedded clip, watch it on YouTube. Don’t forget to subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube on your way out to ensure you remain in the loop with the latest in Apple news, jailbreaking, reviews and how-tos. Without further ado, here’s everything Apple has in store for the Phone app on iOS 10. First World Problems with the Phone app In the early days of the iPhone, the stock Phone app offered a good enough experience when it came to ordinary cellular calls and their FaceTime counterparts. But as VoIP apps began to take hold, the user experience gradually suffered with each passing day because the Phone app wasn’t extensible at all. For instance, apps like WhatsApp couldn’t access your Favorites or the list of recent calls. Calls made in VoIP apps didn’t register in Phone’s Favorites and Recents. You couldn’t call a person via Skype by tapping their screen name in the Contacts app. And worse of all, incoming VoIP calls would show as notifications on the Lock screen. This is what folks on pre-iOS 10 releases see when a Skype call comes in. VoIP experience on prior iOS editions left a lot to be desired. VoIP apps were even not permitted to display a fullscreen photo of the person calling on the Lock screen, let alone offer up iOS’s standard Remind Me and Message buttons. And, worst of all, answering a VoIP call from an app like Facebook Messenger from its Lock screen notification simply took you straight to the app. CallKit-enhanced VoIP apps provide the same experience as cellular calls. With CallKit, Apple aims to solve these pain points in one fells swoop. One of the few new frameworks in iOS 10, CallKit was designed to help developers integrate their VoIP apps tightly with the Phone app and the Lock screen. Introducing CallKit CallKit lets VoIP apps integrate with Phone’s interface, allowing the user to easily access any VoIP-enabled calls in Recents and contacts in Favorites. You can view and answer incoming VoIP calls like you would cellular calls. VoIP calls can be muted, put on hold, switched from audio to video and more—right in the Phone app, using its interface and controls you’re already familiar with. VoIP apps integrate with Phone without disrupting its familiar interface. VoIP calls are now allowed to associate a phone number with a name in your contacts and Phone is permitted to tap third-party intelligence to warn you that the incoming call from an unknown number is a possible spam. Other CallKit features Here’s a quick overview of some of the most important features that CallKit enables: VoIP apps take advantage of CallKit to integrate with iOS 10’s Phone app VoIP calls display directly on Lock screen VoIP calls register and are included in Phone’s Recents and Favorite tabs Launch the VoIP app right from the call Place VoIP calls from Phone’s Contacts, Favorites and Recents Mute, Call Waiting and other controls are available for VoIP calls on Lock screen VoIP entries from Contacts can be added to Phone’s Favorites VoIP calls interact with CarPlay and Bluetooth accessories VoIP calls coexist seamlessly with other active calls VoIP calls honor Do Not Disturb setting VoIP calls from people on your blocked list don’t go through User permission is required to allow CallKit-enabled VoIP apps Incoming VoIP calls are checked against your blocked numbers Just to mention briefly, Apple’s partnership with network giant Cisco will let you receive calls made to your work number right on your iPhone. This integration between the iPhone and the Cisco Spark app will be available when iOS 10 launches next month. Ways to call people via VoIP As mentioned, you can now add your VoIP-enabled contacts to your phone’s Favorites to call them like you normally would. And because VoIP calls now appear in Phone’s Recents, returning a missed VoIP call is as easy as tapping its entry in Recents. VoIP calls/contacts integrate with Phone’s Recents/Favorites. In addition to placing VoIP calls without leaving the Phone app, iOS 10 provides this elevated experience elsewhere in the system. For instance, VoIP apps which also happen to integrate with Siri will make it easy to call friends and family using your voice (i.e. “Hey Siri, call my Mom on WhatsApp”). Flow chart shows interactions between CallKit, the system and a VoIP app. The ability for Siri to call people on your behalf using a specific VoIP app will prove indispensable for times when you’re using your iPhone hands-free with a Bluetooth headset. CallKit even extends to Apple’s in-car infotainment platform, called CarPlay. With CarPlay, for example, you would tap the Skype icon, or use Siri Eyes Free, to call a desired contact through Skype. As briefly mentioned, iOS 10 lets you place VoIP calls to people from their contact cards. VoIP apps in Contacts That’s because iOS 10 lets VoIP apps nest their own buttons in contact cards. Although the Contacts app has for years supported adding screen names for chat services like Skype, Facebook Messenger, Yahoo Messenger and so forth, you just couldn’t tap someone’s Skype user name to call them on Skype. iOS 10 lets you do that because interactive buttons for VoIP apps like Skype and WhatsApp now appear on contact cards. Let me state for the record that some of these new CallKit-driven features cannot be tested until first iOS 10-enabled VoIP app updates arrive in the App Store. VoIP calls and your privacy It’s important to note that Apple won’t force you to let any VoIP app integrate with Phone without your permission. Just like you must authorize third-party apps to access your camera or microphone, CallKit-enabled apps will put up a new type of iOS prompt at first run asking for permission to use CallKit. Tap OK and the app integrates with Phone. Or, select Don’t Allow to continue using the VoIP app like before. I’m not sure who’d want to disallow CallKit access for VoIP apps and live without Phone/Lock screen integration, VoIP entries in Recents/Favorites, spam alerts and other perks. Any VoIP apps that you’ve permitted to use CallKit will honor your current Do Not Disturb setting and a list of blocked contacts. Lastly, you can revoke these permissions for VoIP apps by flipping switches in Settings → Phone → Service Providers. Spam handling Phone spam is a major problem, especially in China where it’s spreading like wildfire. iOS 10’s Phone provides an extension point for specialized third-party apps which can provide information automatically if the incoming call is a possible spam. Voicemail transcription If you missed a call from someone important and they left a message in your voicemail, you can see its transcription in Phone → Voicemail. That’s is cool if you want to see what the call was about without listening to voicemail which, by the way, requires cellular connection to download the audio files. Using Siri’s underlying speech-to-text engine, this Google Voice-like feature should do a decent job of transcribing recorded voicemails into text. Just don’t expect the transcriptions to be 100 percent reliable as their accuracy depends on a variety of factors, like pronunciation, call quality, network conditions and so forth. At any rate, it’s good to know that your iPhone transcribes voicemail in case you ever need this feature. Apple has said that voicemail transcription will launch in beta. Taking it all in Apple’s given the somewhat outdated Phone app a much-needed boost with iOS 10. The operating system integrates VoIP apps into all the right places, from your Lock screen to Phone’s Recents and Favorites to people cards in Contacts. And this shall have, methinks, some profound effects on the user experience. No longer will non-techies be wondering why calls from VoIP apps appear as unfriendly Lock screen alerts while FaceTime and cellular calls behave as expected. From a usability standpoint, there should absolutely be no difference between cellular phone calls and those made via third-party VoIP apps. Put simply, iOS 10 ticks all the right boxes when it comes to making and receiving calls and it does so without relegating VoIP apps to second-class citizens, like before. iDB previews iOS 10 We’ve explored other aspects of iOS 10 in rich detail: Beta 5 changes Beta 4 changes Beta 3 changes Beta 2 changes Messages with animated effects, stickers, apps & more Overhauled Lock screen with Raise to Wake, widgets, rich alerts & more Siri meets apps & powers smarter QuickType keyboard suggestions Bedtime and Wake alarm help keeping you well rested For other hands-ons, see our previews of macOS Sierra, watchOS 3 and tvOS 10. iOS 10 availability iOS 10 Developer Preview is available to members of the Apple Developer Program. iOS 10 Public Beta is available to non-developers who are signed on the Apple Beta Software Program. The operating system will release as a free update for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch this fall. System requirements for iOS 10 are same as those for iOS 9, with the exception of iPhone 4s, original iPad mini and iPad 2 which are are no longer supported. Chime in with your thoughts Are you excited about the upcoming changes for iOS 10’s Phone app? I must admit I rarely use voicemail so I’m not very excited about voicemail transcriptions. On the other hand, as a heavy user of apps like WhatsApp, Viber and Facebook Messenger I’m very much looking forward to the tight integration between Phone and third-party VoIP apps. As a cherry on top of the already delicious cake, third-party Caller ID will definitely save me from the frustration of answering a spam call—that’s one less problem to worry about in dealing with persistent spammers.

The feature sends your current location to emergency officials,” Seitz reports. “Apple also has included the ability to cancel the SOS call within 10 seconds in case the dialing happened accidentally. The SOS feature also can be used for medical emergencies. It can be programmed to share a basic medical ID, giving emergency services your name, age, and listing any medical conditions. It also will automatically message the friends and family you have assigned as contacts.” Read more in the full article here.

Comment Feed 18 Comments cashxx Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 5:48 pm · Reply Sounds good on paper, I worry about how much accidental calls will happen tying up 911 calls for actual emergencies. Hopefully it doesn’t happen, but that is my worry with it. And media will have a field day with it. michaele11111 Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 9:41 pm · Reply No more so than the idiots who call now saying they can’t find their car keys. John Friday, August 12, 2016 - 2:35 am · Reply Nothing new about that. About 10 years ago my Blackberry butt-dialed 911. How about ... Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 5:52 pm · Reply What will save their lives is when they wise up and quit putting themselves in these situations. It’s just a fact that there are deviants and evil people in this world who will take advantage of woman who don’t take precautions. As far as I’m concerned these women should have been trained and armed to protect their own lives. That is, if the states they live in allow them the basic right of defending their lives. Dan Uff Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 8:05 pm · Reply I don’t know how old you are, How About…but by saying “they (women) should wise up and quit putting themselves in these situations” is like saying people should know better and not get into car accidents. Even if a women takes every precaution to stay safe, that something or someone could still come into that women’s life in the blink of an eye. michaele11111 Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 9:42 pm · Reply Really, really moronic comment. MacRaven Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 10:50 pm · Reply As a female, I somewhat agree with “How about” I am always surprised to see a woman walking home late at night, alone. Or jogging in secluded areas alone. We can say women should be empowered to walk wherever they want any time they want, but the truth is a man with a weapon or a strong one without can put an end to that empowerment real fast. Truth is you have to not put yourself in a position to be easy prey for these sick individuals that do exist no matter how many Take Back the Night protests or empowerment hashtags are texted. These sicko’s don’t care about rights or rules. Women have to be smart enough to avoid risky situations. Granted some men break into homes where you are supposed to be completely safe, or other things go wrong where it should be safe. So anything can happen. It’s a sad situation that sometimes can be avoided and sometimes it’s just nothing else you could have done. But having a weapon could save her life. I don’t have one, but I applaud any woman who does get herself one. Now, Now... Friday, August 12, 2016 - 12:29 am · Reply Here is another female’s point of view… https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sEYGcXSmpQ Herself Friday, August 12, 2016 - 12:39 am · Reply Thanks. As a woman occasionally needing to walk alone at night in the city, I have relied both on my wits and on a concealed weapon. I had to talk my way out of dicey situations a few times, but the feel and sense of my Kimber hardware leant me the confidence to do that. — Before any of you lads suggest women should never walk alone, I suggest you examine yourselves. If YOU had to walk home after dark through a sketchy neighborhood, wouldn’t you welcome being accompanied by myself: armed and dangerous—? MacRaven Friday, August 12, 2016 - 2:57 pm · Reply Good for you to arm yourself! Pancho Friday, August 12, 2016 - 4:42 pm · Reply Good for you, but remember, a handgun is no substitute for brains and situational awareness. cmfj Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 9:21 pm · Reply Always blame the victim KRONOS Friday, August 12, 2016 - 2:48 pm · Reply Why do you have to go and make this a political discussion by bring up Trump?!? 😳😡😳😡😳 Matt Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 9:39 pm · Reply This will be just like Apple Pay. One emergency center out of 250,000 will have the equipment to handle the calls, and that one will not have trained its personnel to operate it. ScreenPhiles Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 11:29 pm · Reply I get the feeling Apple Pay is much more accepted than you ‘re giving it credit for. Just saying. Now, Now... Friday, August 12, 2016 - 12:24 am · Reply Those two female joggers would have been better off armed with a gun and no not Apple’s stupid emoji green squirt gun. Because when seconds count, police are minutes away! David Friday, August 12, 2016 - 8:35 am · Reply Relying on police to save you is stupid 1. Don’t do stupid things with stupid people in stupid places 2. You can only rely on yourself for protection. Carry a gun. (Get training on defense shooting) trondude Friday, August 12, 2016 - 10:19 am · Reply Yup, by the time police arrived, you would be dead. A nice little snub nosed 38 special could have saved them. Fight, don’t surrender to psychopaths. And for all you Anti gunners out there, tell those dead ladies again how a gun would not have helped at all..yeah, I though so… Add Your Feedback Name (required) Email (required) Web cancel reply Notify me of new comments via email.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search CVS Pay officially unveiled, dashing Apple Pay rumors Brittany A. Roston - Aug 11, 2016 9 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit We’ve known for a few weeks now that CVS Pharmacy has been working on making mobile payments available in its stores, and all signs pointed toward those mobile payments involving Apple Pay. While CVS had confirmed in a roundabout way that it was looking into mobile payments, it didn’t specify platforms one way or the other. Now, it turns out via an official announcement, CVS wasn’t planning to launch Apple Pay: it was developing its own mobile payments platform called CVS Pay. CVS announced the new mobile payments platform today, saying it is an end-to-end payment platform launching in CVS Pharmacy stores. CVS Pay, much like Walmart Pay before it, is part of the CVS Pharmacy app, bringing the payments system, loyalty program, and prescription pickup tools all together in a single mobile destination. Much like Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Walmart’s own version, CVS Pay has customers add their debit and/or credit cards to the CVS Pharmacy app, after which point they can hold their phone out to be scanned when checking out. The app presents a barcode, which the cashier scans. After scanning, the items are scanned, then the customer taps which payment card they want to use within the app. The app can also be used to handle all aspects of prescriptions using a single scannable barcode. In order to verify prescriptions and payments, the user has to enter some kind of detail, like a PIN and signature. Payment confirmations are delivered in-app after the payment goes through. In the present, CVS Pay is available in Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, and New York, but the company anticipates rolling it out to all stores across the nation by the end of this year. Both iOS and Android apps are supported, with the mobile payment app supporting all major credit cards, including American Express, MasterCard, Visa, and Discover. The app also supports debit cards, HSAs, and Flexible Spending Account cards.

Log in Sign up Login with Facebook Login with Google Go Advanced News Reviews Phones Home News Blog Reviews Comments (22) Post your comment Apple's iPhone web share shrinks, MacBook sales grow 11 August, 2016 Two reports concerning Apple market success are out today giving us some detailed overview of the company's device popularity. The first one is courtesy of Device Atlas and explores website visits from different devices in Q2 2016. As it turns out Apple's iPhone has lost traffic share in 18 out of 20 countries surveyed. The two unaffected markets are Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. According to the report, the 4" iPhone footprint is still massive with over 20% in Canada, France, Japan, UK and USA. This is probably due to the iPhone SE release. Other interesting details from the study are the rapidly growing share of the Quad HD screens and the noticeable gap in the PPI density in emerging markets vs. developed markets. Finally, the report shows the top 5 most popular devices in a plethora of markets, where the iPhone 6s series and the 4" iPhone 5/SE lineup occupy most of the first and runner-up places. Meanwhile TrendForce issued a report exploring the notebook shipments in Q2 this year. Apple is up big time with sales growing 30% over Q1 thanks to the refreshed MacBook. However that didn't suffice and the company is still down 24% for the first half of 2016 compared to H1 2015. Lenovo and HP remain the market leaders in notebook shipments and both are up from Q2 2015 and H1 2015.

(Reuters/Andrew Kelly) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Life as Laboratory August 11, 2016 Apple may be diving deeper into the health-care industry. The company filed a patent application for a wearable device that can measure electrocardiographic (ECG) signals through a series of sensors, according to a filing published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) today (Aug.11). The application leaves the form of the device open ended—it could be a ring, a bracelet, a brooch, or something else—but its sole function is to monitor the heart. The company has already identified health care as an area of big potential. Last year, it released ResearchKit, an open source software framework designed to help doctors and scientists gather data from participants using iPhone apps. And wearables like the Apple Watch are natural ways to collect a variety of information. But the patent application points to something more targeted and sophisticated. Traditionally, ECG machines takes readings from multiple electronic nodes that display results that vary depending on the location of the recording in relation to the heart. Apple’s design makes the placement of the device on the body irrelevant. To calibrate the device, users must undergo an “enrollment” process where readings are taken from different parts of the body before using the device. It can use those measurements to correct abnormalities resulting from the device’s location on a person’s body. A wearable heart monitor. Rumors of the Cupertino giant creating a non-watch health-care wearable have already been circulating. In an interview with The Telegraph last year, CEO Tim Cook said didn’t want to “put the [Apple] Watch through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) process,” but that he “wouldn’t mind putting something adjacent to the watch through it,” signaling the possibility of a device like the one in the patent filing. Apple’s dive into the medical industry has already shown promising signs. GlaxoSmithKline recently coming onboard Apple’s ResearchKit platform to run a clinical study. If it can find the right applications, the health-care industry could be a big boost for Apple’s wearables business, which so far has been far from a hit. Like many companies, Apple regularly applies for patents for products that never get made. That might be good news for those who are overwhelmed by the Apple Watch simply monitoring their pulse.

Yes, that’s right — there’s yet another way for you to pay with your phone. But CVS’ method, like that of Walmart Pay and Starbucks, is a mobile payment solution that uses a barcode. So unlike the top dogs — Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay — it’s not using near field communication or Magnetic Secure Transmission — you have to open the CVS Pharmacy app, add your credit card information, pull up your barcode at the register, and have the clerk scan your phone. You then choose one of the payment methods you have added and that’s it, your order has been processed and you’ll see confirmation in the app. If you’re at a CVS drive-thru, you only need to share a pickup number, and for prescriptions, you’ll need to verify your identity through the app before orders are processed. Related: Walmart Pay is here to enhance your Walmart shopping experience If you’re a CVS ExtraCare customer, you can link your ExtraCare card to CVS Pay so that you only need to use your phone to access all ExtraCare deals and rewards, and handle payment. The company says CVS Pay is currently available in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, but the feature will see a nationwide rollout “later this year.” CVS Pay works with all major credit cards — including MasterCard, Visa, Discover, and American Express –debit cards, Health Savings Accounts, and Flexible Spending Account cards.

 Apple employees sure love Teslas Kif Leswing Aug. 11, 2016, 5:50 PM 18,968 facebook linkedin twitter email print Elon Musk has a lot of fans at Apple, apparently. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Someone who says they are an Apple employee posted a picture of what looks like an Apple headquarters parking lot to Reddit on Thursday. The picture has since been removed from Reddit, but it included a lot of Tesla cars parked right next to each other. In the photo, you can see a Tesla Roadster, the first car the company released, several Tesla Model S vehicles, and even a few Tesla Model X SUVs, which came out earlier this year. Most of Apple's offices around Silicon Valley are equipped with car chargers, and it's not entirely surprising that Apple employees would prefer Tesla cars, considering the electric-car company has drawn a fair share of inspiration from Apple. As one person in the thread says, people call Teslas the "Palo Alto Camry." And perhaps Apple is drawing inspiration from Tesla as it works on its own electric car.

(Photo: Berkeley) A few years before I became the Observer’s ‘space guy’ I had a very different career at the Walt Disney company. I like to say I was a drone and my duties included training interns from around the world to be drones too. I made no money, was headed nowhere, and was trapped to say the least. That’s until one of my idols, Steve Wozniak, invited me to dinner and substantially altered the course of my life and career. The Woz and I had exchanged a few messages on social media and on Words With Friends where we had  pretty competitive games and exchanges over the course of a couple of years. Apple’s co-founder is known for being welcoming to his fans but I wasn’t expecting to be treated to a dinner I could never afford, at a steakhouse I would never step foot in otherwise. Thankfully, Woz loves steaks. A few days before, I was at work when I heard through the grapevine that Woz would be giving the keynote address at the IBM Innovate Conference at Disney’s Dolphin Resort. This was near Epcot Center—where I worked at the time. I messaged him and asked if I could come shake his hand and say hello before his keynote. He replied right away, enthusiastically. To my surprise, he offered to have a meal with me while he was in town. I assumed it would be with a group of folks from IBM or other fans. But it wasn’t. It was just me and him in a fancy, empty restaurant—Shula’s Steakhouse. As someone who almost bankrupted his parents buying Mac after Mac as a kid, I was nervous as hell. I still have the very first iPod—the one with the wheel. You could say I was a fanboy before Macs were cool. Literally—I was born with a Mac in our house. I barely had enough money to pay for parking at the high-end resort. Woz was waiting for me by the check-in counter. IBM employees stared from across the lobby. It was a far cry from the last time I was there—when one of my bosses tasked me with tracking down an expensive piece of art that had disappeared during delivery. The Woz was gleeful and shook my hand. I suggested we hit the bar for a quick bite because I knew he had an extraordinarily busy schedule. During our previous late night games or chats, he would be in different places around the world giving talks and keynotes. Instead, he insisted we sit down for a real meal. Woz went straight for the surf and turf. I do not remember what I ordered because I so intensely trying not to look and sound like an idiot. I do recall eating some of his mac and cheese. The conversation started casually and I described as briefly as I could, my mundane work day. At the the time, my girlfriend and I had completed a Star Trek pilot in our free time and I told him all about it. He was very open to listening and gave a little feedback. Had an amazing and inspiring dinner with Steve Wozniak tonight. I really can't put into words. A photo posted by Robin Seemangal (@nova_road) on Jun 2, 2013 at 5:25pm PDT That’s when the Woz started giving me some details on Aaron Sorkin’s Steve Jobs film which was being kicked around at Sony at the time. He described having a meeting with Sorkin and joked about how intense he was. From there, Woz talked a little bit about Jobs and their time together building the first Apple computers. It was amazing and surreal. He doesn’t hold contempt for Jobs given their very public falling out in the early days of Apple but instead, reflects fondly on their days together. I was frank with Woz about my lack of formal education and the lack of direction in my career. Woz has pretty radical ideas about education and spoke about what could be the future of learning. He believed that teachers were a thing of the past and that in the future, we would be self-educating using computers and whatever technology was available to an individual student. He believed that anyone with drive would have the world at their fingertips. It’s something that he convinced me was possible and it was something I would run with following that dinner. Our discussion of technology took a surprise turn towards on encryption and privacy. Woz sounded a bit paranoid when he told me that the NSA and relating entities were aggressively expanding their reach and that most of what we thought was private, was not. I didn’t really think too much of it at that moment, until a couple of days later, Edward Snowden would make his famous leak. One fun thing that Woz told me that was relatable to my current situation, was that him and Steve Jobs came to Disney in the late eighties and met with the company about putting the first Apple store on main street at Disney’s Magic Kingdom. Jobs eventually didn’t go for it. He spoke about the constant tug of war between him and his Apple co-founder on everything from motherboard components to the overall vision of the company. I felt undeserving of the insight I was now privy to. Our dinner wrapped up and Woz told me what I assume he tells all his fans after meeting them, that I was a bright young man and he hoped I would do something better with my life. He was convincing and I needed to be convinced. I took his advice. With no money and no clear path ahead, I put in my two weeks notice and left to pursue a career as a writer. Today, I’m just one of the many lives Woz has touched and improved for the better. Even if he wasn’t trying. I may not have gotten JJ Abrams to read my Star Trek pilot, but because of Woz’s inspirational words and my editors at the Observer, I sort of live in it. I get to travel around covering NASA and some of the most interesting and barrier-breaking people on the planet. And I get paid! Happy Birthday, Woz. Thanks for dinner and everything else.

Above is a picture of the same spots (only 4 Teslas) from Google Streetview. Apple and Tesla have had a rocky relationship when it comes to poaching employees from each other, but that doesn’t mean Apple employees aren’t fond of Tesla’s work. This is very apparent by this Reddit thread, initiated by an Apple employee. The image attached to the thread shows seven Teslas parked right outside of Apple’s headquarters. The seven Teslas occupy almost all of the electric charging stations outside of Apple’s front entrance, though there are others at other various spots throughout the campus. Of the seven parked out front, there are 2 Model X cars, 4 Model S cars, and yes, even one Roadster. Teslas are incredibly popular among Apple employees and there are likely more than just these six scattered throughout parking at Apple’s HQ. In fact, on Google’s Street View for the area, you can see four Teslas parked out front. Given that Apple is working on its own electric vehicle under the “Project Titan” moniker, the relationship publicly hasn’t been the best between Apple and Tesla. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has referred to Apple as the “Tesla graveyard.” Musk’s comments came during what a poaching war between Apple and Tesla, with both companies poaching employees from the other. Musk has also said that it’s an “open secret” Apple is building an electric car.

Behold one of Apple’s first-ever computers Kif Leswing Aug. 11, 2016, 5:29 PM 24,808 facebook linkedin twitter email print Charitybuzz/Michal Cairns In the summer of 1976, two young friends in Northern California agreed to sell 50 computers to a local store for $500 each. After working for 10 days straight, they pulled it off. That computer went on to be known as the Apple-1, Apple Computer's first product. Those young men were Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs. And now, Apple is the most valuable public company in the world.  One of the computers they built during that time is now up for auction at Charitybuzz. It's an early Apple-1, and the auctioneers think it might actually be a pre-production version. It's one of perhaps 60 Apple-1 computers still in existence.  Currently, it's going for $270,000 after three bids. But the auctioneer thinks the one-of-a-kind computer could be worth as much as $1,000,000.  Take a look:  View As: One Page Slides The auction doesn't just include the computer. It also has full documentation, including an instruction manual, schematics, and tapes. Charitybuzz/Michael Cairns The Apple-1 originally retailed for $666.66. This one is currently going for over $250,000. "It’s Apple’s rookie baseball card," an appraiser said. Charitybuzz/Michael Cairns At the time the computer was built, Apple was based in the Jobs family garage. So Apple used an answering service located at 770 Welch Road, before it moved to Cupertino. Charitybuzz/Michael Cairns This logo was designed by the third Apple founder, Ron Wayne, and was used until 1977, when Apple adopted the logo of the apple shape with a bite taken out. Charitybuzz/Michael Cairns The Apple 1 used tapes with a special peripheral called the Apple 1 Cassette Interface. That doubled the Apple 1 storage capacity from 256 bytes to 512 bytes. One of these tapes contains the BASIC programming language, and the other includes a Star Trek and Blackjack program. Charitybuzz/Michael Cairns The auction comes with an original instruction manual. Charitybuzz/Michal Cairns Let's zoom in. The introduction warns: "Please read Section 1 thoroughly, before attempting to 'power-up' your system..." That's quite the opposite of Apple's approach today, which envisions products people can start using without ever reading the manual. Charitybuzz/Michael Cairns According to the auction listing, this is one of the few known Apple-1 computers to look like it started as a "blank original-run board" instead of a board from the production runs. Charitybuzz/Michael Cairns Some of the components are different from the components that were eventually included in later Apple-1 computers. Charitybuzz/Michael Cairns Some of the components have also degraded over time. Charitybuzz/Michal Cairns This is the backside of the board. YouTube/Charitybuzz It's been cleaned and cared for, and although experts think it can be powered-up, it's not advisable because of its fragility. YouTube/Charitybuzz This board was likely built in the summer of 1976. YouTube/Charitybuzz The first demonstration of the Apple-1 was in July 1976 at the Homebrew Computer Club. YouTube/CharityBuzz The Apple-1 was designed and hand-built by Apple founder Steve Wozniak. YouTube/Charitybuzz Here's the on switch. YouTube/Charitybuzz The Apple-1 was sold at the Byte Shop, in Mountain View, California. Paul Terrell, who owned the store, bought 50 Apple-1 computers for $500 each.   Other extant Apple-1 computers have sold for as much as $330,000, and many are in museums, like this one currently on display at the Sydney Powerhouse Museum. Wikipedia But that one had a case. Wikipedia 10% of the proceeds will go to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society of Arizona. Current Apple CEO Tim Cook uses Charitybuzz too, to auction off an hour of his time and lunch. This year, lunch with Cook came out to $515,000. CharityBuzz Check out the auction here.

We actually don’t know Thursday, August 11, 2016 · 4:01 pm · 5 Comments “This week, Fast Company published a series of interviews with Apple’s executives from Tim Cook to Eddy Cue and Craig Federighi and Bozama Saint John and if there was one point that was clear across the board is it’s that Apple is built on the core principle of “making great products” but the way to deliver that greatness might look different from what it used to,” Carolina Milanesi writes for Techpinions. “This leads many to believe we are dealing with a different company altogether rather than a company that is evolving.” “Tim Cook said he does not read all the Apple coverage, which means he is possibly spared the many times the ‘Steve would not have done this’ or ‘This would have never happened under Steve’ sentences appear in a commentary,” Milanesi writes. “Aside from the obvious (we actually don’t know what Steve would have done), there is another point many seem to forget — today’s market is very different than it was when Steve Jobs was CEO.” “Different is not necessarily bad. Tim Cook has a different personality than Steve Jobs and, as we learned from this week’s interviews, a different management style,” Milanesi writes. “Apple is evolving and, in my view, doing it faster than it would have done under Steve Jobs. This is crucial for the long-term play.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Apple has a lot of irons in the fire right now.

Loading... Comment Feed 5 Comments chrish1961 Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 4:28 pm · Reply One point to consider is that even if Steve were still with us, he’d have evolved with Apple. Apple’s principles haven’t changed under cook. Were he still here he’d be running a much different company than ten years ago and he’d probably be doing it much like it’s being done now. Herself Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 4:38 pm · Reply My answer to the question “What would Steve do?” is this: the same thing. First, he’d have retained Cook as COO and scaled up operations smoothly with only a bump or two along the way. Second, he’d have understood the central importance of the iPhone, and placed more focus on it as the hub, with Macs and the rest being secondary. Third, he’d have pushed the Internet of Things, with a particular interest in health monitoring and a more personal car. Fourth, he’d have hired Ahrendts, for her fashion awareness, impressive retail showcases and tailored customer-centric experiences. And finally, he viewed the BYOD movement as a Trojan Horse to breach the enterprise, and eventually win over past adversaries like IBM, partnering with them. Shadowself Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 7:47 pm · Reply “…if there was one point that was clear across the board is it’s that Apple is built on the core principle of ‘making great products’…” That used to be true. Today, the goal is to make Apple great. The premise is that a great Apple will inherently make great products. It’s a false premise. In the second Apple iteration (hell, in the early days too) the underlying premise was, “Get a product to the 95% stage and ship it. Then iterate on it and innovate on that until it becomes what everyone knew from the beginning that it could become.” (As an aside, Dell and their ilk were a “Get a product to 80% and ship it. In the next iteration let’s get it to 85%. In the next get it to 87%, And so forth.) Now Apple is about getting something to market to try to capture as much of that market as possible. Don’t worry about getting it to a 95% solution. Don’t worry about totally blowing the socks off everyone. Sure the original iMac was not perfect, but it was a 95% solution and it surprised everyone — in a good way. Sure, the 30” Cinema Display was not perfect, but it was a 95% solution (maybe 98% solution) and it surprised almost everyone. Sure the first iPod was only a 95% solution and it took a few iterations to get it close to 100% with several surprises along the way. (Remember Jobs pulling the first nano out of the watch pocket of his jeans with the comment, “I always wondered what this pocket was for.”) Sure the iPhone was a 95% solution but it surprised people and took the cell phone world into a new direction. And the list goes on. Since 2012 what Apple product fits that criterion? (Don’t even dare mention the Apple Watch which is really an iPhone peripheral masquerading as a stand alone device. It was an 80% solution that might get upgraded to an 85% solution by the end of this year.) Unless there is a course correction — which I most fervently hope there is within the next year — Apple is headed toward fitting the joke we used to tell about Microsoft products: By version 3.0 it will be usable and good enough. It will never be great. kentkd34 Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 11:46 pm · Reply 85%, 95% whatever. But I question whether the percentage is that high. Shoot for 100% even if you know its not achievable. Settle for 85 or 95 %. Really? Wow Chuckmeister Friday, August 12, 2016 - 12:21 pm · Reply We know exactly what Steve would do.

Purcher reports, “Haptic stimulation can act as notifications for one or more events, such as the receipt of an email, a text message, a news story, a stock price, a reminder, and/or a low power state of a power source in the electronic device.” Read more in the full article here.

By Amy Feldman Biography October 18, 2014 When markets are turbulent, as they’ve been lately, there’s something to be said for sticking with funds that have a long history of downside protection. Franklin Mutual Global Discovery (ticker: TEDIX), which has $26 billion in assets and a 22-year history of buying undervalued stocks, is one such fund. “Obviously, the names change, and the world changes, but our fundamental approach is very consistent,” says co-manager Peter Langerman, who is also Franklin Mutual Advisors’ CEO. The fund’s strategy, since the days when Mutual Series was run by Max Heine and legendary value investor Michael Price, has involved searching for companies, wherever they might be, that trade at a discount to what the managers figure is their intrinsic value.

Langerman and his co-managers—Philippe Brugère-Trélat and Timothy Rankin—aren’t afraid to be activists, pushing holdings to reallocate capital or make other changes to their businesses, and they’re not averse to waiting. Turnover, at 24%, is well below that of the fund’s world-stock peers, according to Morningstar. The fund’s results have been especially good in down markets, such as 2001, though performance tends to trail rival funds during rallies, as occurred in 2012. Over the past five years, Franklin Mutual Global Discovery has returned an average annualized 8.6%, versus 6.5% for the MSCI World Index. Barron’s visited the managers in their Short Hills, N.J., office, to see where they’re finding opportunities today. The global fund’s exposure to U.S. stocks has continued to climb—U.S. stocks now make up 52% of the portfolio, up from just 14% five years earlier. But they’re also finding value in global energy companies and European banks. The fund also has a cash stake of 9%, giving it the flexibility to move quickly as deals come up. Until the recent selloff, Langerman said, the fund had been trimming and getting out of positions that were approaching their target valuations. “It’s harder today than it’s been for a while,” he said then. But as the market has tumbled, it has created a better environment for these value managers to buy—and they’re searching out new ideas and adding to existing equity and debt positions on the cheap.

Sources: Morningstar; MSCI; Franklin Templeton Langerman, 59, and Brugère-Trélat, 64, have been running the fund since 2009; Rankin, 42, became a co-manager in 2010. But all three have been at the firm for many years. Langerman, a onetime bankruptcy attorney, joined the firm in 1986 as an analyst. Brugère-Trélat joined two years earlier, after French President François Mitterrand nationalized the private bank where he had been working. Rankin, 42, arrived at the firm in 1997 after a stint as an equity analyst. Today, the trio is finding opportunities in energy, which represents 10% of holdings, and includes Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A) and Apache APA 1.8568913078277574% Apache Corp.

Both are restructuring plays, snapped up during difficulties. “We don’t want to just make a commodity bet,” Langerman says. At Shell, for example, the managers wrote a letter to the management and board, and held follow-up calls. Today, they’re heartened by Shell’s new CEO, Ben van Beurden, who has committed to selling assets and cutting investment spending. In Europe, the managers historically owned food, drink, and tobacco stocks, but today, they’re finding better deals in financials, especially the banks. “There was a perception that the European banks were behind the curve in adapting to the new market environment, compared with the U.S. banks, both in terms of balance-sheet size and capital ratios, but there has been a tremendous change in the way banks have managed those two issues over the past two years,” says Brugère-Trélat, who also manages the Franklin Mutual European fund (TEMIX).

While clouds still loom in Europe’s low growth, many of Europe’s best banking franchises are cheap, he says. “We like very solid retail-oriented banks that are trading at a significant discount, relative to American banks.

It’s a little bit over book value at this point, and it’s got low-double-digit earnings growth per share. And they’re still in the midst of their restructuring.” Mergers and acquisitions have begun to pick up amid low growth and low interest rates, Langerman says. “We’ve been quite active,” he says. That activity has included controversial tax inversions, in which one company buys another based in a lower-tax country, with the intention of moving the joined firm’s headquarters there.

Distressed companies, historically a larger part of the fund, have been a tougher bet recently as default rates among corporate bonds have stayed at low levels. “We’re looking, and they’re chunky,” Langerman says. “It’s like M&A: You’re not doing anything, and then all of a sudden, there’s a huge deal and you can put $500 million to work. You just have to be there and be able, ready, and willing to act.” With a few billion in cash on hand, the ability to move quickly shouldn’t be a problem.

Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Aug 11, 2016 at 4:06PM With the S&P 500 trading at all-time highs and soaring about 95% in the past five years, it's tempting to conclude that buying opportunities have disappeared. However, while there certainly may be fewer bargain investments than there were in the stock market five years ago, there are still a few enduring businesses worth buying today that could yield handsome profits for investors. Indeed, three stocks look particularly enticing after selling off in the past year: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). ^SPX data by YCharts. All three of these companies boast focused, enduring business models with excellent track records, yet their stocks are trading at valuations low enough to make them a buy. This isn't something that can be said every day about iconic brands consumers are using on a daily basis. Here's why each of these stocks is worth buying and holding. A straight-up steal A wildly conservative valuation of Apple -- a valuation based on a forecast for growth no better than the historical rate of inflation -- pegs the stock's fair value at just under $130 per share. With shares trading at just $108 today, the stock is trading at a meaningful discount to fair value. Image source: Apple. But is such a lackluster forecast for the company's growth prospects realistic? In the past, the company has repeatedly wielded its brand recognition and pricing power in new segments, driving significant growth for the company -- and there's little reason to think the tech giant couldn't do it again. In addition, the same Apple garnering a higher switching rate from other smartphones to iPhone today than ever before will likely continue to attract new customers, keep existing customers around, and convince deeply entrenched users to keep buying new Apple products for years to come. Apple's seamlessly integrated ecosystem of hardware, software, and services has built the company both a "sticky" business model to retain its loyal customer base and a moat to keep competitors at bay. As investors fret about Apple's declining iPhone sales in 2016 as the company faces the tough comparisons to its monster iPhone 6 cycle last year, the pullback in the stock price offers investors an attractive entry point. An undervalued collection of brands and franchises Imagine if you could buy a slice of some of the world's hottest characters, brands, and franchises in entertainment -- think Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, ESPN -- all at a bargain price. You can. Thanks to the stock's underperformance recently, investors can pick up shares of Walt Disney, which owns all of these brands and franchises, for a price-to-earnings ratio of just 18 -- a steal compared to where the stock was trading as recently as late last year. DIS PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts. A testament to these franchises' pricing power, Walt Disney's collection of powerful assets generated a record $9.2 billion in net income during in the trailing 12 months -- nearly doubling the company's $4.8 billion in net income in fiscal 2011. Going forward, there's no reason to believe Walt Disney won't continue to effectively squeeze everything it can out of its diversified set of powerful assets. Yes, Disney's transition of ESPN from its cable roots to an Internet-streaming future may be introducing some near-term challenges, but the dominant sports network isn't going anywhere. As investors question the future of ESPN, now is a good time to buy a slice of some of the most enduring brands in the world. A focused bet on the inevitable transition to streaming TV Netflix stock isn't cheap -- at least it's not when compared to its slower-growing peers. Its price-to-sales ratio of 5.4 is almost twice Disney's of 2.9. But a dominant player in the middle of a huge secular trend shouldn't be expected to trade conservatively. Fortunately, however, Netflix stock has been slammed recently, declining 22% in the past 12 months, making it more enticing than it was. Not only is Netflix growing rapidly, but it's building out a massive library of compelling, original content. Image source: Netflix. Living up to its valuation, the company is seeing rapid growth. On the back of an undeniable shift toward streaming TV, Netflix's total streaming members have increased from 65.6 million to 83.2 million during the past 12 months. And growth persists; in Q3 alone, the company expects to add 2.3 million more streaming members. Longer-term opportunities look significant, too. Management expects its U.S. member base will eventually peak between 60 to 90 million members -- up from 47 million today. And with just 38 million streaming members outside of the U.S., Netflix's international expansion still has significant room to run. Still, if the company's long-term potential truly is compelling, why are shares down 22% in the past year? The sell-off follows two arguably shortsighted concerns: Investors expected faster international adoption, and the company missed its second-quarter guidance for streaming members as extensive media coverage of the company's price increase sparked near-term headwinds in member churn rates. These concerns are creating buying opportunity, as both are arguably worse than they seem. In international markets, Netflix is working to localize its international offerings in order to attract more customers. And the company's price increase was actually well received by the members being un-grandfathered into the higher price; it was simply confusion among other members about hyped media coverage of the price increase that prompted the worse-than-expected churn. While they are trading lower, now is a great time for investors to buy shares of these iconic companies and hold them for the long haul. Investors who buy these stocks today may be sitting on much larger portfolios 10 years from now. Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple.

Just last month, the country was threatening to ban the devices in what it was calling an anti-smuggling move. All that threat did in turn, however, was drive up the price of iPhones already in the country and actually increase smuggling. The trade ministry in the country has gone to the Traded Promoting Organization and requested licenses for nine Iranian companies to import Apple’s smartphone. Apple currently doesn’t have a retail presence – or any other presence – in Iran, though unofficial Apple Stores are increasingly common. Iran is preparing to allow local companies to import iPhones for the first time to try to curb the huge market in smuggled Apple products, state media reported Thursday. The trade ministry has requested licences from the country’s Trade Promotion Organisation for nine Iranian companies to import iPhones, according to the Tasnim news agency. Unofficial Apple stores are common in Tehran’s upmarket malls, and many of the country’s young and wealthy population carry the latest models of iPhone. iPhones have long been smuggled into Iran and the government has largely ignored the problem, but over the past two months the attitude had changed. The government’s original plan was apparently to ban the import and use of iPhones and focus on registering phones that were legally in the country. With the legalization of importing iPhones, however, Iran will now be able to register all mobile phones for the first time. When Iran’s plans to register all phones came to light last month, mobile operators, customers, and the union of mobile phone sellers were concerned as to how the data would be used. Those concerns appear to still be there, though, and the government has not yet commented. Further complicating the issue, U.N. sanctions against Iran mean that U.S. companies have limited ability to sell their products in Iran. Apple last year, however, started discussions with Iranian distributors hoping to ease the sanctions as time passed. Whether or not the decision to allow the importing of iPhones is a sign of easing regulations remain to be seen. Apple has not recently commented on its efforts in the country.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Black Friday Deals GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: Black Friday Deals Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / News / Mobile Phone News / A waterproof iPhone may take awesome underwater photos A waterproof iPhone may take awesome underwater photos by Chris Smith 15 August 2016 0 shares Read Comments It’s no secret Apple may be planning to release a water resistant iPhone, allowing it to keep pace with Samsung, Sony and other top smartphone manufacturers. However, a new patent filing published this week, suggests any handset resistant to the wet stuff will also take pretty awesome underwater photos. The 2013 filing, granted in 2015 and unearthed by Patently Apple (via Wired) explains new colour-balancing editing software, which would “remove undesirable tints from objects in a scene,” to ensure the water looks blue. Related: What is IP68: Waterproof ratings explained The filing states: “Removing undesirable tints without removing the tint of the water itself results in images with more realistic coloring of people and objects in the scene, without eliminating the color cues (e.g., blue water) that indicate that the image is a photograph of an underwater scene.” Given the filing is three years old, rather than newly made, it would indicate the technology might now be ready for prime time. Of course, Apple does not roll all of its parents into real world gadgets, but there is cause to believe the company may do on this occasion. Multiple rumours have suggested next month’s iPhone 7 will be the first to officially claim water resistance. The current iPhone 6S has been shown to offer some level of waterproofing, but it’s not something Apple has ever acknowledged. While better underwater photos would be a bonus, it seems highly unlikely it’ll be a tool that can be used by divers. Most smartphones claiming water resistance only do so to depths of 1.5 metres for around 30 minutes. That would make it ideal for a scuba session at least.

Apple Evan Selleck Contributing Editor | August 11, 2016 50 shares 33 9 0 8 0 0 0 0 0               By the time Apple got around to releasing the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, big smartphones were a pretty common element in the smartphone market. Devices with 4.7-inch displays, and bigger, were all over the place, even some with screens reaching up to six inches or more. Some of you out there might even remember seeing pictures of people holding up tablets with similar screen sizes to their faces, and how silly we all thought that was back then. Here we are where five-inch smartphones being the norm, and bigger devices managing to pack in plenty of features to make the bigger screens worthwhile. I think it’s pretty fair to say that Samsung has led that charge, both in adopting bigger smartphones, and also letting even bigger “phablets” find a way into our lives, too. Of course, there is a difference between a smartphone with a big screen and a phablet, as Samsung continues to try and push with the release of its Galaxy Note phablet lineup. A combination of a tablet and a phone, there should be something that truly differentiates a phablet from a run-of-the-mill smartphone. In the case of the Galaxy Note7, for instance, and just like every previous Galaxy Note phablet before it, that differentiator comes in the form of a stylus. The S Pen has come a long way over the years, now more advanced than ever, easier to use, and probably won’t get stuck inside the device, either. The S Pen also activates specific features that aren’t readily available without it, like being able to write notes on the display when it’s locked, or being able to magnify the screen elements to get a closer look. You can even create a GIF with the help of the S Pen now. When Apple launched the iPhone 6 Plus, the company didn’t have an official stylus under its umbrella of products. Back then, in fact, a stylus seemed like an impossibility, considering the company’s staunch stance on the idea for so many years when talking about tablets. But then the 12.9-inch iPad Pro arrived with its Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil, and suddenly the tables had turned. The Apple Pencil is an amazing accessory, one of the best stylus I’ve ever used, and the same sentiment can be heard echoed all over the place. Apple came out of the gate swinging into the stylus market with the Pencil, and it will (probably) only get better from here. So what about adding support to the 5.5-inch iPhone lineup? After some consideration, I thought this would be a pretty solid idea for the iPhone 7 Plus, and beyond, and Apple could introduce specific features within the larger iPhone that would make it perfectly suitable for the Apple Pencil as an input device. As a reference point, the Galaxy Note7 only features a 5.7-inch display, so the difference here isn’t that big. But then I weighed all those rumors about an iPhone 7 Pro – a device that would sit at the very top of the pyramid when it comes to iPhones, with standout hardware and software features when compared to its brethren. This could be one way to make the iPhone support the Apple Pencil – just make a Pro model, like Apple has done with the iPad lineup. This type of distinction between devices wouldn’t bum me out as much as a difference between the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, simply because it would be more than just a change in screen sizes that offer, for whatever reason, more features. A Pro model of an iPhone would be geared towards folks who not only need the bigger screen, but also want that support for a stylus, too. With all the rumors swirling around that an iPhone Pro exists, or has at least existed at some point, I can’t help but wonder if this is something that’s more inevitable than questionable. The Pro lineup for tablets has worked for Apple thus far, so why not extend that thinking to the iPhone family? What do you think? Would you buy a phablet iPhone with supported features and Apple Pencil support? Or should Apple keep the Pencil with the iPad lineup only? Let me know!

Jordan Kahn - 3 months ago @JordanKahn MacBook Pro Apple View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit There has been a lot of talk about the OLED touch bar rumored for the upcoming MacBook Pro refresh expected this fall. But how exactly will the touchscreen work for users? If you’ve not been paying attention, Apple is thought to be working on a new slimmer MacBook Pro that according to reports will feature a thin touchscreen on the keyboard in place (or possibly above?) the top row of the keyboard. The top keyboard row currently includes function keys, aka the F1-F12 keys that double as quick keys for screen brightness, Mission Control, iTunes media transport controls, etc. So it’s thought that the new touchscreen might replace the function keys and offer those functions as contextual buttons on the touchscreen. But surely Apple won’t JUST use the new OLED touchscreen for digital versions of the function keys it already has? Menu bar and Dock A couple of the maybe obvious options would be to bring down buttons from the menu bar or dock that maybe aren’t currently as accessible directly from the keyboard. Having the dock would allow for quick keys for access to, of course, all of the apps and windows in your dock, which I’d expect alone would be much more useful than the current function keys if they are indeed being replaced by the OLED touch screen entirely. App-specific keys But perhaps a better approach to the display will be, as we previously speculated, to offer contextually sensitive buttons, offering up different function keys depending on what app you’re currently using. Sort of like how the menu bar functions currently change in macOS depending what app you’re focused on, the OLED display could offer up app-specific commands, like media transport controls for iTunes, frequently visited sites, bookmarks or navigation controls for Safari, or customized toolbar items for other apps like Finder, Logic Pro, or Pages. The iOS keyboard, even when using an attached Bluetooth keyboard, offer similar functionality, as noted by 9to5 readers.  If Apple does take this kind of approach, and I’m hoping it does, it may or may not allow third-party developers to take advantage by building their own quick keys for the feature. Touch ID Apple is also working on integrating Touch ID functionality into the Mac, which would allow it to unlock the fingerprint-based tech for payments and authentication/unlocking of the Mac and other apps like it does on iOS devices. But the TouchID functionality according to our sources is currently being integrated into the power button of the MacBook, which would presumably be separate from the OLED touch bar. There have been rumors and Apple patents in the past detailing methods of embedding Touch ID like functionality underneath displays, but that’s something Apple has yet to introduce in an actual product. Apple is said to be planning an upgraded pressure sensitive home button for iPhone 7 with haptic feedback, but it’s unclear if that will mean physical changes to the appearance of how it’s integrated into the device.  An OLED Touch Bar for other Macs? If Apple does believe in the rumoured OLED touch bar as a serious hardware innovation for the MacBook, then what does that mean for the rest of its Mac lineup? Will the shiny new hardware be limited to the MacBook Pro? Then there was the concept above that imagined what the feature might look like on a new Apple keyboard for other Macs. If Apple does take the contextually sensitive, app-specific approach to the new hardware like I’m hoping, developer adoption for third-party apps will of course be limited by the fact the feature is only available on the new MacBook Pro at launch. How would you like Apple to take advantage of the new OLED touch screen for MacBook Pro?

VIEW ALL PHOTOS IN GALLERY Apparently, the PlayStation 4 Neo isn't the only thing we'll be hearing about on Sept. 7. Word has it that Apple is planning an event the same day. Bloomberg on Wednesday reported that the Cupertino tech giant has "an event currently scheduled for Sept. 7 to introduce next-generation versions of the iPhone." Granted, Apple has not made any official announcements, so this is not confirmed. But Bloomberg heard it from "people familiar with the matter," so it has to be true, right? Apple didn't immediately respond to PCMag's request for comment, and a spokesman for the tech giant flat-out declined Bloomberg's request. VIEW ALL PHOTOS IN GALLERY Last month, well-known and reliable leaker Evan Blass, who commonly shares inside information about upcoming smartphones on his Twitter account, tipped a Sept. 16 next-gen iPhone release. That Sept. 16 date, according to Blass, is when the phone will hit store shelves, suggesting that Apple's launch event would happen before. So Bloomberg's sources could be right about this. Last year, Apple held its fall iPhone event on Sept. 9 and released the phones Sept. 25. //Related Articles 13 Secret Codes That Unlock Hidden Features on Your Phone As for what to expect from Apple's big announcement, don't get your hopes up for any major changes. The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed people "familiar with the matter," recently reported that Apple is planning "only subtle changes" for the upcoming models. They will likely be thinner, but with the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes used for the past two years. Meanwhile, more significant changes are reportedly in the works for Apple's MacBook Pro laptop lineup. The upcoming notebooks, which are rumored to support Touch ID and have OLED touch bar where the function keys would normally be, won't be making their debut on Sept. 7, however, according to Bloomberg's sources.

Click Apple Watch Could Save Your Life With Upcoming Feature The upcoming SOS feature for the Apple Watch acts as a panic button for a wearer to call 911 from the watch. (Apple) PATRICK SEITZ 8/11/2016 Reprints The recent murders of two female joggers in separate incidents on the East Coast show the need for mobile technology that can quickly contact police in an emergency. An upcoming feature for Apple's (AAPL) smartwatch could be a lifesaver. The SOS feature in the watchOS 3 software update, due out this fall, acts as a panic button for people to call 911 from their Apple Watch. To activate SOS and call 911 for help, you only need to press and hold the side button on the Apple Watch for about three seconds. The feature works wirelessly with a user's iPhone to automatically initiate a call with local emergency services. Many joggers strap their iPhone to their arm and play music while they're running. The unsolved murders this month of Karina Vetrano in Queens, N.Y., and Vanessa Marcotte in Princeton, Mass., have served as a wake-up call to women who jog alone. In the wake of their deaths, many fitness enthusiasts likely would be receptive to any technology that could keep them safer. Apple says the feature will work in all countries where the watch is sold. The feature sends your current location to emergency officials. Shares closed down less than 0.1% at 107.93. IBD'S TAKE: With iPhone sales declining, Apple needs new products like the Apple Watch to drive growth. The N in IBD's CAN SLIM Investing System stands for "new," such as new products, services or management that can help drive profits and share prices higher. Apple also has included the ability to cancel the SOS call within 10 seconds in case the dialing happened accidentally. The SOS feature also can be used for medical emergencies. It can be programmed to share a basic medical ID, giving emergency services your name, age, and listing any medical conditions. It also will automatically message the friends and family you have assigned as contacts. Apple introduced the SOS feature in its keynote presentation at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco on June 13. "We're finding that people who are wearing Apple Watch wear it all the time and this opens up some new, great ways that we can help," Kevin Lynch, vice president of technology at Apple, said at WWDC. "One of these is actually getting help in critical situations, just by pushing a button that's actually on you. So you might be having a medical emergency or a safety situation (and can use SOS)." It's a feature that people will rarely, if ever, need, but it's great to have, he said.

The app was developed in conjunction with Detroit-based mobile app developer jācapps and with collaboration from Apple. “To the best of our knowledge, it’s the first for a broadcast radio station (and of course a first for jācapps),” Jacobs Media President Fred Jacobs wrote in an email.  Apple CarPlay is currently available on more than 100 car models, mimicking the touchscreen experience of an iPad or iPhone in the car dashboard. jācapps COO Bob Kernen characterized the development as putting radio “front and center on the Apple CarPlay screen” and “a giant step forward for the entire radio industry in its quest to remain dominant in today’s cars.” “jācapps’ App Everywhere platform is giving us the flexibility of distribution that our audiences are demanding in a very efficient service,” Greater Media Director of Digital Operations Steve Meyers said in the announcement. jācapps is also developing mobile apps for the Android Auto system, the first of which launched on that platform in 2015.   Receive regular news and technology updates.

MacDailyNews Take: Appel isn’t a “roadmap” company. Smart companies will have to learn to live with some element of surprise from Apple – and, in toto, they will profit from it.

All those years of building applications around IE …and then trying to fix broken compatibility. That opened up people to alternatives..I’ve heard from our IT directors. trondude Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 2:16 pm · Reply Most if not all ‘enterprise’ companies are going to go with vendors who offer support contracts. Back in 2004, Apple had such a service and it worked well. But now, they have forsaken that for the consumer market, and left MS to fill the void (among other business vendors). A company with any sense will always have support contracts in place to mitigate downtime and therefore, lost business and revenue. That is the game with enterprise IT. It isn’t just about using ios and OSX, as we know they are superior systems to MS offerings, but if you cannot get timely support (within 1 hour) then you do not know how to manage your ‘enterprise’. Apple is not in that position anymore, and that is why most are still stuck with MS and its supported business apps, etc. Danox Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 3:28 pm · Reply MS, sucks and always will, all Apple needs to do is make a very good product and sell it, simple M Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 5:00 pm · Reply True, but Apple fills a niche..meaning, limited to iOS and allowing a few Macs on the network for stuff that needs a Mac (I’m in the latter group). We aren’t talking about servers and Macs for everyone. iOS has a very strong presence in enterprise. Our facility, the largest employer in my not so small city, replaced pagers with iPhones, for example. The IT admins, engineers, even maintenance, all have iPads.

For those who aren’t in the loop, ConnectED is a program started by the Obama Administration to help provide cutting-edge technology to schools in the United States. Apple pledged $100 million towards iPads, computers, and other Apple devices. As it stands, Apple is aiding 144 schools. As of today, Apple has 32,145 iPads in the hands of students and 9,042 teachers, as a part of ConnectED program. On top of this, 4,434 hours of “Apple Professional Learning” have been taught by Apple representatives at schools. As the 2016-2017 school year kicks off, there are now 32,145 students at underserved public schools across the country who are learning, creating and exploring on iPad through Apple’s ConnectED commitment. Today, 701 students in Indianola, Mississippi, were introduced to iPad as Carver Elementary School became the 66th ConnectED school — and the first of the school year — to transform its classrooms with Apple’s cutting edge teaching and learning technology solutions. In addition to providing an iPad to every student and teacher, Apple’s ConnectED grant also includes professional learning, wireless infrastructure upgrades and ongoing support. The full breakdown can be found on Apple’s ConnectED page. Tags: Connected, Education, iPad About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Earlier this week, we learned Apple might be working on a “killer” health device set to launch next year. Now a new patent application may reveal what the company is cooking up. Cupertino’s latest application for a patent details a wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) that you can wear anywhere on your body to monitor the electrical activity of your heart. The device would be able to recognize where it is in relation to your heart and then recalibrate to provide accurate data. Apple also notes that it could be fashioned into various shapes, including a watch, ring, pendant or brooch to match any outfit or activity. The company is expected to launch a new Apple Watch or two later this year, but the smartwatch probably won’t push too far into the health market. Apple has previously said it doesn’t want the device to get bogged down in a lengthy FDA approval process. Instead, the company could pack its more advanced medical technology into a separate product like the one listed in this filing, though there’s no guarantee this futuristic ECG will ever see the light of day.

Apple recently released iOS 9.3.4, which will likely be the company's final update before it comes out with iOS 10 (and possibly a new iPhone, but we'll get to that later). The official description of the update says it "provides an important security update for your iPhone or iPad and is recommended for all users." But Forbes and other media outlets have alleged that what it really does is prevent people from using a newly developed jailbreak method from Pangu. "There is nothing more to it, no performance improvements, no refinements or new features, nothing," Neurogadget wrote Thursday. It recommended users "think twice before upgrading," especially if they're interested in jailbreaking their devices. If you decide you want to update your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch with iOS 9.3.4, you can go to Settings > General > Software Update and click "download and install." Related Stories A10 Chip, Rumored To Power iPhone 7, Appears In Leaked Photo Apple To Release Health-Centric Apple Watch Next Year However, most of the Apple fervor this week was around iOS 10, which is rumored to be coming out in September alongside the iPhone 7. iOS 10's beta 4 was released to the public to test on Tuesday, BGR reported. iOS 10 will let users write in Messages, send each other animations, exchange hidden photos, use Siri for apps, book reservations in Maps, access a redesigned News app and more, according to the Apple website. Perhaps most importantly, iOS 10 will come with dozens of new emoji. Apple will now let users choose from female athletes and more diverse characters. The gun will become a water pistol, and there will be a pride flag, TechCrunch reported. The new operating system will work on iPhone models 5 through 6s, iPad mini 2 through iPad Pro and the 6th generation iPod Touch.

Football Conference game at the Apple Bowl—they were wearing different uniforms. Harney, a defensive lineman with the Okanagan Sun, and Thompson, an offensive lineman with Westshore Rebels, played seven seasons of minor football together in their hometown of Squamish. The two were teammates again for one season of high school ball at Howe Sound, then spent both the 2014 and 2015 seasons together at Bishop's University in Quebec. After spending a decade as teammates, Harney, 20, and Thompson, 21, both made the jump this season to the B.C. Football Conference, but to different destinations. "It was a little strange to see us not with the same team, that hasn't happened too often," said Harney. "It's all about the path that each of us are taking in football, and it's good to see (Tyson) continuing on. He's a big guy, a good player and I'm proud of him. It was nice to see him." With Harney resting an injury, the two didn't get a chance to go head-to-head during Saturday night's 27-21 win by the Sun, but met on the field afterwards. "He's like a brother to me," the 6-foot-5 Thompson said of Harney. "It was really good to see him Saturday. I'm happy for him and the success his team is having, but losing tasted a little sour at the same time. "You're always friends no matter what, but you still want to win. I know James feels the same way." Harney and Thompson, who are in contact on a weekly basis, will see each other again on Saturday, Sept. 10 when the Sun travels to Victoria. This time, assuming he's healthy enough to play, Harney plans to prove a point to Thompson, who is not only his close friend but now his rival. "It's going to be fun, we're going to see who's the better player," Harney said with a laugh. "There's always a little harassment between us about who's the better football player." This weekend, Harney and the Sun will host the Vancouver Island Raiders, while Thompson and the Rebels are on the road to face the Kamloops Broncos.   We encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story's topic, but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards.

 Why Apple's big event tomorrow is going to be exciting, even if the iPhone 7 is boring Antonio Villas-Boas Sep. 6, 2016, 11:33 AM 97,359 facebook linkedin twitter email print Martin Hajek The iPhone 7 is going to be a snooze. That's what everyone is saying about Apple's upcoming iPhone because, apparently, it won't come with a beautiful new design. That's what we'd usually expect this year, considering that the latest iPhone — the 6S — is the "tock" in Apple's two-year tick-tock cycle. Instead, the iPhone 7 will supposedly look exactly like the iPhone 6 generation, and it doesn't seem like its new features will be all that exciting. At the same time, despite the rumors of a boring upcoming iPhone, Apple's big iPhone event that's taking place tomorrow on September 7 could be very interesting, as we could potentially see a total refresh in what to expect from the company in the future. And since I'm interested in technology, I can't wait to hear how, or if, one of the biggest tech companies in the world is going to change things up about one of the most impactful pieces of technology ever released. CEO Tim Cook. Stephen Lam/Getty Images A new way of doing things For one, we'll finally find out if Apple will indeed switch up its usual two-year iPhone release cycle, which it hasn't done since the release of the iPhone 3G in 2008. Supposedly, Apple is planning to release an iPhone with a fresh new design in 2017 to celebrate the iPhone's 10th anniversary. As I mentioned above, we'd normally expect a new iPhone with a new design this year. That's significant because we might be waiting three years between each iPhone generation instead of the usual two from now on. It could change everything about how and when people buy iPhones. Will it change how often you buy one? Will you buy the first, second, or third model? The most recent supposedly leaked image of the next iPhones. Letemsvetemapplem The only hint at what the next iPhones will be called came from a sketchy rumor from a German Apple blog called Apfelpage.de, which claimed that it will be called the "iPhone SE." And there's always the chance that the three-year cycle is a one-time thing. Apple could return to the usual two-year cycle after the supposedly special iPhone that Apple has in store for 2017. No one knows, which is why I'll be listening very attentively during Apple's iPhone event. The headphone jack Pretty much every rumor is claiming that Apple's upcoming iPhone will not have a headphone jack, which sounds completely crazy because almost every device that can play music has a headphone jack. Instead, we'll either be using Bluetooth or the Lightning port to listen to music. There are several rumors and theories as to why Apple would ditch the headphone jack on the next iPhone. Some say that it'll let Apple make thinner iPhones. Others say that the digital signal from the iPhone's Lightning port makes music sound better. Austin Evans/YouTube But the only explanation that matters is the one Apple provides. Hopefully, the company will give some sort of reasoning as to why it's removing the most universal and ubiquitous connection port for listening to music. I am looking forward to understanding why I might not be able to plug in my wired headphones anymore. Apple could also not even give an explanation. Motorola didn't mention the fact that the new Moto Z doesn't have a headphone jack during its event. There was no justification, no explanation, no reasons why it's better this way. Apple's iPhone event is happening on September 7, and it'll be interesting to see how everything about the iPhone will change, even if its design this year remains the same.

Days after Apple launched its first bug bounty program, zero-day hunters Exodus Intelligence upped the ante. Apple will pay hackers up to $200,000 to identify vulnerabilities in its products. Exodus, meanwhile, is offering up to $500,000. Cybersecurity researchers are invited to participate in the new Research Sponsorship Program (RSP), which awards bounties for both zero-day flaws and exploits against patched (n-day) vulnerabilities. Currently, iOS 9.3+ flaws are going for a max of $500,000, while Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge bugs could earn you up to $150,000 or $125,000, respectively. Found Firefox vulnerabilities can net you up to $80,000, Windows 10 up to $75,000, and Adobe Reader and Flash up to $60,000 each. The firm is also offering a bonus structure for zero-day vulnerabilities, which adds to the initial payment for every quarter the exploit remains alive. "Through the launch of the RSP, Exodus is excited to be engaging the global research community in our mission to provide the highest quality of vulnerability intelligence in the industry," company president Logan Brown said in a statement. Registered users can view zero-day and n-day hit lists on the new RSP website. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. //Related Articles Uber Launches Bug Bounty Program The tech titan—a long-time holdout in the bug bounty arena—announced its new program during last week's Black Hat event in Las Vegas. Compensation ranges from $25,000 for a sandbox break to $200,000 for a secure boot hardware exploit. The program covers five issues, all on iOS or iCloud. Historically, Apple shied away from bug bounties, citing high bids from the government and black markets. And while $200,000 (or even $500,000) is a good payday, it's pennies compared to the upwards of $1 million third parties like Zerodium have paid security researchers to uncover Apple vulnerabilities. In June, Cupertino moved to an unencrypted kernel in iOS 10, allowing enthusiasts and security researchers to look inside, while also increasing device security.

On both phones the antenna strips have been moved to the top and bottom edges.  Alleged leaked picture of the front of the new iPhone, which looks identical to the current model Credit: Letem Svetem The pictures do not offer any shots of the bottom of the phone, where Apple is expected to remove the 3.5mm headphone jack. Nor do the photos elucidate whether the phone will be called the "iPhone 7" or "iPhone 6se". Contrary to some rumours, the front of the phone looks the same as the iPhone 6s, with the device maintaining the switch-like Touch ID home button.  The online store behind the alleged leaks told Letem Svetem that it also has pictures of a blue version. But reports suggest that if Apple is to release an additional colour it will be "Space Black".  The deeper shade could replace the "Space Grey" iPhone Credit: 9to5 Mac Faster processor Pictured below is a new chip that could be used in the next installment of the iPhone series, which could be even more powerful than the high-speed iPad Pro, according to tests leaked in China. The pictures of the chip don't reveal any features of the new chip, but separate leaked screenshots suggest the iPhone 7 could be up to 50 per cent faster than the current model, with 3GB of RAM and a 2.37GHz processor.  Leaked image shows an upgraded "A10" chip that could be used in the upcoming iPhone Credit: Weibo All-glass iPhone Apple moved away from a glass body for its flagship phones when it launched the iPhone 5 back in 2012, which had a metal back. But now the company is reportedly looking to reintroduce the glass chassis to the handset.  One of the manufacturing companies Apple works closely with has been developing an all-glass case for smartphones that is anticipated to be the shell of next year's iPhone.  Foxconn, whose main customer is Apple, has spent the last year designing the glass body, according to Nikkei, which could be used in the 10 year anniversary edition of the iPhone, due to be released in 2017.  The company is a key supplier of metal bodies for the iPhone 6s Plus and SE, as well as the anticipated iPhone 7 Plus. It shares orders for the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7 with Catcher Technology and Jabil.  The news lends some credibility to rumours that the 2017 iPhone will have an all-glass shell and OLED display.  A new Apple wearable?  Apple's patent for an ECG wearable that could be worn on the wrist or ankle Credit: Patently Apple Apple has patented a new wearable device that could be worn on the ankle or wrist and measure electrocardiographic signals for a more accurate heart rate.  While we can't expect such technology to make a real appearance any time soon, Apple does have some changes planned for its Watch. Reports suggest the Silicon Valley giant will release an updated version of the current model, as well as a second generation. Both Watches are expected to have faster processors and be more waterproof. The bigger changes will be reserved for the Apple Watch 2, which could have GPS capability, a barometre and a larger battery. It will probably look similar to the current Watch and will have the same screen size and thickness. As with the iPhone, Apple is expected to be holding back any major Watch design changes until next year.  These could include a front facing camera and independence from the iPhone.  About | The iPhone 7 Release date In typical Apple fashion, the iPhone 7 is likely to be unveiled in early September at an event in California, and go on sale a few days later. Reports suggest it will be held on September 7, with the new products being available from the 16. It is likely to be an action-packed event, with the company expected to unveil a new Apple Watch and MacBook laptops, as well as possibly an upgraded iPad Pro.

Apple took 17.9 percent share in the domestic market in the April-to-June period, down 1.8 percentage points from 19.7 percent a year ago, according to Kantar, a data research subsidiary of WPP. Apple’s share was also behind Huawei’s 25.7 percent and Xiaomi’s 18.5 percent, “While the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus remain the top selling smartphones, pressure from Huawei’s Mate 8 and P9, Xiaomi’s RedMi Note 3 and Mi 5 and Oppo’s R7 has led to increased competition in the (domestic) market, said Tamsin Timpson, a Kantar researcher. Huawei shipped 16.6 million smartphones in the first quarter, taking the lion’s share of China’s smartphone market, followed by Oppo, Xiaomi and Apple, according to another research firm Strategy Analytics. The Chinese market still has great potential for Apple, which is set to release new models next month, Kantar added.

Drake’s summer 2016 chart dominance has put him in rare ­company: Since 1963, only three other artists have led the Billboard 200 and Billboard Hot 100 for at least 10 weeks with an album and ­corresponding single, as the Toronto MC has done with Views and “One Dance” ­(featuring Wizkid and Kyla) this year. But unlike Adele, Santana and Whitney Houston, Drake’s mastery of an emerging platform -- streaming -- paved his way. The numbers speak for themselves: Since its April 29 release, Views has logged the six largest streaming weeks ever for an album’s tracks, and nine of the top 10. Its 20 songs have ­generated 2.1 billion on-demand audio streams through the week ending Aug. 4, according to Nielsen Music, the only album ever to pass the 2 billion mark. And 41 percent of Views’ 3.4 million equivalent album units earned to date have come from streaming units, compared to 42 percent from traditional album sales. The MC’s deal with Apple in mid-2015 aligned him with its digital power, while in May he passed Justin Bieber as the most-streamed artist in Spotify’s history. As streaming continues to become the prevalent revenue and listening model, Drake, 29, has emerged as the format’s de facto Muhammad Ali. How much of that is ­strategy, and how much is luck? Still Summer '16: Drake's 'One Dance' Holds Lead for Song of the Summer “You can’t do this with just any artist; he’s got a great team around him that delivers,” says Apple’s Jimmy Iovine. “And when you’ve got a team like that, you can have things come out at the right time.” Indeed, part of the success is down to good timing: During the first half of 2016, on-demand audio streams increased 97.4 percent year over year, according to Nielsen Music, with R&B/hip-hop leading all genres at 27.4 percent of that total. But Drake is singular in his ability to drive his fan base toward the format. Statistics from MusicWatch provided to Billboard show that 80 percent of Drake’s fans have engaged with him -- in the form of follows, retweets and likes -- on a social media platform; 26 ­percent own music by him; and 19 percent actively follow him (as opposed to merely ­listening) on streaming services. “Drake is very active on social, even sometimes controversial, and when you have an audience that reacts to social, it intersects -- it’s kind of like the 'Kardashian effect,'" says MusicWatch managing partner Russ Crupnick. “But also there’s a constant flow of quality releases, so something is always keeping fans’ interest; he’s active in collaborations with other artists; there’s always something stirring the pot.” Unlike superstars for whom every move is an event, Drake keeps his activity at a constant simmer, peaking at ­strategic moments. Before 2015, he would release tracks every couple of months through his SoundCloud account, resulting in off-cycle platinum hits such as “0 to 100/The Catch Up” and “Hotline Bling” (later included on Views). But since signing his Apple deal, he has shifted his release forum to his weekly OVO Sound radio show on Apple’s Beats 1. Drake Tops Justin Bieber as Most-Streamed Artist on Spotify, Company's Playlists Hit a Billion Weekly Streams “With OVO Sound, Drake is fully ­connecting with subscribers on the streaming service, at least on Apple,” says Rob Markman, manager of artist relations at Genius. “He’s not just delivering music, but delivering events: On Twitter when OVO Sound is airing, you can see people listening and commenting. He’s creating a culture around streaming and embracing it.” “One of Drake’s real gifts is that he doesn’t go away,” says New York Times pop critic Jon Caramanica. “That feels real and also is a strategic choice. No matter what he said last year about ­disappearing to go finish work on Views, there is no actual disappearing.” But perhaps most of all, the genre-spanning diversity of Drake’s music is key, particularly as playlists grow in ­importance. On Spotify, which receives more than 1 billion weekly streams across its in-house playlists, Drake’s music is found on Today’s Top Hits (9.8 ­million followers), Rap Caviar (4 ­million), Teen Party (2.2 ­million) and Are & Be (2.1 ­million), among others. ("He's not afraid to experiment with styles and genres; he can fit on any playlist," Markman says.) And Drake's tendency to lend verses to buzzing songs by emerging artists -- remixing hits by Migos, iLoveMakonnen and Fetty Wap in recent years -- keeps him connected to the younger demographic that represents the core of on-demand streaming's users. “You have to consider where Drake’s fans are,” adds Caramanica. “His idea of soundtracking actually lines up very neatly with a streaming economy, where you don’t have to go dig and find ­something -- this thing is there for you in the moment when you need it. Drake is the titan of that.” A version of this article originally appeared in the Aug. 20 issue of Billboard.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon Whatsapp Email Ads by Google For the second time this year, you’ve dropped your iPhone, causing your screen to crack like an unswept spiders web. You’re not that concerned. Like many people, you bought AppleCare+ when you picked up your brand-new handset at the Apple Store. This gives you up to two replacement devices for a $99 deductible AppleCare: What Are Your Options & Is It Really Worth It? AppleCare: What Are Your Options & Is It Really Worth It? High customer satisfaction ratings and a large network of stores capable of performing certain repairs on-site give AppleCare the edge over the average warranty - but are the benefits really worth the price?

Learn To Fix Anything With These 4 Websites You can spend hundreds of dollars to have a professional help you out, or you can learn how to fix it yourself for the cost of some tools and a couple hours of work. Read More ? What does it take to become a certified Apple repairman? And is it worth pursuing as a career? Getting Started as an AppleCare Technician Like most things in the iWorld, getting qualified as an AppleCare technician is incredibly expensive. Members of the general public have to purchase the training material that teaches you how to diagnose and repair iDevices. This is bought from the Apple Store for $299.00. Those already employed at an Apple-authorized service facility get it through their workplace. Although this is quite expensive, it’s worth emphasizing that this is the whole AppleCare training package, and includes courses on Mac repair and maintenance. If you want to just become an Apple Certified iOS Technician (ACiT), you only need to pay attention to a fraction of the material. This is listed on the Apple website. Then, you’ve got to learn it, and I don’t mean “get familiar with it” but really learn it. If you want to call yourself an AppleCare-certified technician, you’ve got to become an expert. This makes sense. Apple is effectively staking their reputation on your ability, and you’ll have to be able to independently diagnose problems, use diagnostic tools, and fix other people’s hardware. Ads by Google Once you’re confident that you know the material, you can then take your ACiT exams. There are two you’ll have to take – the Apple Service Fundamentals Exam (SVC-16A), and ACiT 2016 iOS Service Certification Exam (iOS-16A). These are grueling two-hour ordeals, and you need to score at least 80% on each exam in order to pass. On top of that, the Apple Service Fundamentals Exam contains two separate sections on electrostatic discharge precautions Your Sneakers Can Kill Your Computer: How Static Electricity Works [MakeUseOf Explains] Your Sneakers Can Kill Your Computer: How Static Electricity Works [MakeUseOf Explains] Static electricity is the number one computer hardware killer, and its everywhere!

Candidates will have to score at least 10 out of 12 on each section in order to pass the exam. The cost to take these exams depends on the country you plan to take them in. In the US, it’s $150 each, or $300 overall. If you fail the exam, you’ll have to pay to retake it. Pearson VUE administers the exams online. This means you don’t have to make the effort to go to one of their testing centers, which are typically based in nondescript office buildings or on industrial estates. The test itself is open-book, and you’re allowed to use whatever resource you want in order to answer the questions. Candidates are encouraged to use Apple references to help them answer the exam questions. You’ll then get your results on the spot. If you failed, my commiserations. These exams are hard and have a very low threshold for failure. You should get some feedback on the areas you were weakest on. Go back, study harder, and try again — but keep in mind it could be an expensive cycle if you keep failing the exam. If you passed, congratulations. You’ve got an incredible career ahead of you, and will now be a more enticing hire for SSAs (Self-Servicing Accounts – these are institutions and universities which Apple allows to service its own hardware under warranty), as well as AASPs (Apple Authorized Service Providers). How To Become An Apple Genius In the retail world, the most coveted jobs are at the Apple Store. For a great many people, Apple is a religion, and getting a job with them is akin to joining the priesthood. One of the most respected jobs you can get at Apple Retail is as a Genius. According to GlassDoor’s review system, this pays on average $20.62 per hour, with raises that keep up with inflation. For a retail job, that’s pretty reasonable money. As a result, competition is fierce. According to cultofmac.com, it can take months for Apple Retail to call a candidate in for an interview. The same article says that “job advertisements posted by Apple have usually already been filled about 80% of the time by internal candidates before they even go up.” This is because of an internal policy which says that all applications must be posted, even those that have been filled or promised to someone.  Before you start work as a Genius, you must first go through a grueling 14-day bootcamp, where you learn everything from how to diagnose broken machines Fix Your Own Mac: A Troubleshooting Guide Fix Your Own Mac: A Troubleshooting Guide Apple is known for having great customer service and repair technicians, but if you're no longer under warranty that expertise doesn't come cheap. Why not try troubleshooting your own Mac first next time? Read More , to interpersonal and customer service skills. In 2012, the Genius Training manual was leaked to Gizmodo’s Sam Biddle. It’s obvious from reading it that Apple emphasizes a standard level of customer service above pure technical skills. There are other benefits to working from the Apple Store. Of course, you get significant discounts on hardware. According to Business Insider, this can be as much as $500 off the cost of a new Mac (excluding the super cheap Mac Mini, obviously), or $250 off an iPad. There’s also a liberal work culture. As long as you’re wearing your Apple-issued T-shirt and nametag, you can wear pretty whatever you want. A prominent tattoo or facial piercing isn’t grounds for dismissal like in some jobs.

Learn To Fix It Yourself It’s also possible to fix your own equipment without having to embark upon a new career or undertaking lengthy and expensive training. Unlike Apple’s latest laptops, iDevices are surprisingly fixable, especially when compared to recent devices from HTC and Samsung. A plentiful supply of official and third-party spare parts are available online, so if you’re feeling confident you can skip the extensive training regimen and have a go yourself. Your first port of call should be iFixit, which has repair tutorials for a variety of devices, including iPhones and iPads. It also sells the tools you’ll need, as well as a variety replacement components. Fair warning though, if you go down this path, you risk damaging your device, and you’ll void any warranty (or AppleCare policy) that covers your device. Are you tempted to get Apple-certified? Is “Genius” your ideal job title?

I did pay for the apple care technician training for 299+ taxes. After I studied the material and paid 20 dollars for each exam on Pearsonvue. It is open book, but you have to pass with 80% and above. A lot higher than CompTIA exams. I am talking about the SVC-16A and the MAC-16A and now I am ACMT. I am going to take the ACit and it shows for me at 20 dollars for me. I don't know if its to detter other people. I have the receipts to prove 20 dollars per exam. Book for A+ = 30.00 Exam 901 = 199.00 Exam 902 = 179.99 (I paid for a discounted voucher from Comptia) Total 408.99 AppleCare Tech Training 299.99+taxes SVC-16A = 20.00 MAC-16A = 20.00 iOS-16A = 20.00 about 359.95 Sounds like you only read and not gone through the process.

That included CVS, who today is launching their own mobile payment service to compete with Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay. CVS Pay is a new mobile payment service for CVS Pharmacy stores. Built into the CVS Pharmacy app, CVS Pay works by letting a customer add their debit or credit cards to the app and then showing the app’s barcode to a cashier at checkout. The cashier scans the barcode, and after ringing up the items, the customer selects the payment method that they’d like to use in the app. The service also works in the drive-thru using a pickup number. CVS Pay also integrates prescription pickup and CVS’s ExtraCare loyalty program into your barcode scan. CVS says that its mobile payment service is now live in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. A nationwide rollout is slated for later in 2016. CVS Pay works on Android and iOS and supports MasterCard, Visa, Discover, and American Express as well as debit, Health Savings Account, and Flexible Spending Account cards. Apple, Google, and Samsung already have established mobile payment solutions, but the mobile payments game is still young, and CVS wants to see if it can gain traction with its own service rather than relying on services from other companies. We’ll have to wait and see if the strategy works out for them, but if you’re in one of the markets where CVS Pay is now live, you can go give it a try for yourself right now.

For starters, Apple has made more than its fair share of missteps when it comes to software in recent memory. From the bug-plagued roll out of Apple Maps to the frustrating, confusing and error-prone UI that accompanied the launch of Apple Music, no one would argue that Apple's software track record is flawless. DON'T MISS: One of Apple’s biggest wholesale partners is already taking iPhone 7 preorders Earlier this year, venerable tech journalist Walt Mossberg penned a widely circulated article where he argued that there has been a discernible decline in both quality and reliability across the entirety of Apple's software platforms. "In the last couple of years,” Mossberg wrote, “I’ve noticed a gradual degradation in the quality and reliability of Apple’s core apps, on both the mobile iOS operating system and its Mac OS X platform. It’s almost as if the tech giant has taken its eye off the ball when it comes to these core software products, while it pursues big new dreams, like smartwatches and cars.” Mossberg's post predictably triggered a contentious debate between those who were quick to pile on Apple based on their own software frustrations and those who felt that the narrative regarding the quality of Apple software was in dire need of a more reasoned perspective. For those in the second group, the following arguments were frequently raised to defend Apple: The software Apple ships today is incredibly more advanced than anything else to have ever come out of 1 Infinite Loop. Not only that, but some of the code Apple releases comprises some of the most advanced software on the planet. Furthermore, more people today are using Apple products than ever before, often in ways that would have seemed the stuff of science-fiction even eight years ago. Taken together, the argument goes that Apple's software, on the whole, is just fine and that we just hear more about perceived declines in software quality because Apple's user base has grown by leaps and bounds. Personally, I think it's impossible to deny that Apple's software could use a bit of refining; but the idea that Apple's software quality is much worse today than it was, say, two or even five years ago has always seemed like a reach to me. Having said all that, Apple executives Eddy Cue and Craig Federighi addressed this topic head-on as part of a wide-ranging interview the pair recently conducted with Fast Company. When asked about the idea that Apple software has more problems than in years past, Cue responded: Well, there’s more people, there’s more devices, and there’s more communications available. I actually think our products have fewer mistakes than they did in the past, and our data shows that. But, look, I tell this to my team all the time. When we were the Mac company, if we impacted 1% of our customers, it was measured in thousands. Now if we impact 1% of our customers, it’s measured in tens of millions. That’s a problem, right—things are going to be perceived differently. Our products are way better than they used to be, but there’s a higher bar, and I’m okay with that. I think that is why we’re here. That’s why I get up every day. I like that people have high expectations of us, and that they care about little things that bother them, which, in a lot of products, they wouldn’t bother about. With other companies, you think, that’s about as good as it’s going to be. With us, you want perfection; you want it to be the best. And we want that. Federighi, meanwhile, added the following: A world where people do not care about the quality of their experience is not a good world for Apple. A world where people care about those details and want to complain about them is the world where our values shine. That is our obsession. If people were like, "That’s good enough for me" . . . well, there are a lot of people who can provide that kind of experience. I think that we are focused on working hard every day to make it better. We make mistakes, things get out there, but we work incredibly hard to make things better and better. The bar does keep going up. The number of things you expect from your phone and your computer and the way they interact, and the cloud and services and the way the Internet works with them, the level of complexity goes up and up. But we’re committed to getting better and better, faster than it gets harder and harder. As a final point, it's worth pointing out that Federighi a few months bag pointed out that Apple's core iOS apps in iOS 9.0 were less prone to crashing than the most mature iteration of iOS 8.x."

That hype has gotten to a level that one Chinese wholesaler is willing to risk making Apple very upset by putting the phone up for pre-order. That takes guts, especially when the worst-case result could be as bad as Apple pulling iPhone 7 distribution deals with the wholesaler. Spotted by one eagle-eyed Twitter user, Leleda – which is China’s largest authorized Apple wholesaler – has opened up pre-orders for the new device nearly a month before Apple is suspected to even reveal the new phone. The listing by Leleda seems to suggest that the phone will indeed be called iPhone 7 when it arrives, meaning Apple may not be abandoning its traditional naming conventions with this latest installment. Though Apple has remained tight-lipped on the iPhone 7, some of the most prevalent rumors about the device claim that it’ll be arriving without a headphone jack, which is one that has left many iPhone users scratching their heads. More recent rumors indicate that the iPhone 7 could be missing a physical home button when it does appear, instead opting for a force touch home button that offers different functions depending on the intensity with which it’s pressed. Apple is expected to reveal the iPhone 7 at an event that could take place as early as September 7. It’s there we’ll see if any of these many rumors hold true, and we’ll presumably be getting a solid release date for the device once and for all. As for these early pre-orders? If you’re in China you can give it a try, but it’s probably best to wait until Apple drops some official details on the iPhone 7 before you jump to reserve one.

By Christian Zibreg, Aug 11, 2016 Tweet 8 Comments With no official invites going out yet, speculation continues to mount as to when Apple might be holding a media event to announce the next iPhone. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are going to be unveiled at an event tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, September 7, less than four weeks from today. His report yesterday about the next MacBook Pro with an OLED touch strip mentions as a side-note that the refreshed notebooks “aren’t likely to debut at an event currently scheduled for September 7 to introduce next-generation versions of the iPhone”. The company has not officially announced the September 7 date. An Apple spokesperson declined to comment. Although the claim is attributed to one of the “people familiar with the matter”, which is too often an euphemism for the ”rumor-mill,” Gurman is a well-connected Apple reporter who cut his teeth at 9to5Mac so there’s no reason to call his statement into question. On the other hand, he may have simply extrapolated the launch event date from prolific leakster Evan Blass’s tweet saying the forthcoming phones will hit retail stores on Friday, September 16, with pre-orders beginning on Friday, September 9. Confirmed: Pre-orders start on the 9th. You can extrapolate the launch event date from there. https://t.co/gwoPzIM1dI — Evan Blass (@evleaks) July 28, 2016 If accurate, such a schedule is somewhat unusual as it leaves Apple with just seven days to collect pre-orders for the new phones, before they land on store shelves. In the past, pre-orders for new iPhone models usually lasted for two weeks. For context, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus were introduced on Wednesday, September 9, 2015. Apple started taking pre-orders for the devices on Saturday, September 12, ahead of their retail availability on Friday, September 25. Were Apple to collect pre-orders for the new phones during the usual two-week window between the announcement and launch—and assuming Blass’s September 16 retail availability claim is accurate—then the press event should happen on Tuesday, September 1. Apple usually sends out invites about two weeks before actual launch events so we’re expecting official confirmation early next week. So, what do you guys think? When’s iPhone 7 event going to take place, on the 1st or the 7th? Conventional wisdom tells me September 1, but my money is on the 7th.

There are just few things: double and bigger lens and antena lines in other place. And you wrote a thousand news about these 🙂 Faster, Apple, faster! Eliijah Moss If the rumors are correct, then the new phones will spot 3gb of rams. Not sure how much of that is true, but hey. We might not even realize any changes that’s under the hood. lou111 guess what… 🙂 the “next iPhones” will always have “more ram” and “faster chip” than older one 🙂 Jamessmooth I like sept 1, but my money is on Gurman. Mike Colacone Saal why is it unusual? The 6s is the only release that i remember for iPhone that gave that long for preorder; all of the past phones used this model, if I am not mistaken. askep3 I’m hoping they announce and release the MacBook Pro soon… The rumors for that are pretty exciting.

According to Doll’s LinkedIn profile, he will work in the company’s health software department. Doll apparently rejoined Apple last month as a “director of health software engineering” (via Bloomberg). Doll originally worked at Apple from 2003 to 2009 as a software engineer. At first, he was a pro applications software engineer, though he later shifted his focus to developing an operating system for the iPhone. In 2009, however, a year after the App Store launch, Doll left Apple to co-found the popular news app Flipboard. With iOS 9, Apple introduced its own News app, which Flipboard quickly responded to by noting similarities with the service and its own apps. Flipboard CEO Mike McCue seemed intent on keeping an amicable relationship with Apple, though, noting that it wasn’t a “winner take all” situation. Nevertheless, Doll departed Flipboard last September as part of a bigger exodus of executives. Doll is not the first health/fitness hire Apple has made in recent years. In 2014, Apple was hiring a multitude of higher-ups from the medical sensor field, while that same year it also hired a pair of key Nike FuelBand engineers. Those hires followed Nike FuelBand developer and fitness expert Jay Blahnik joining Apple. Apple has also hired at least one employee with a focus on FDA approvals and product testing. A vague report earlier this week claimed that Apple is working on a “killer device” in the health field that will be released sometime next year. The report, however, gave no specifics on what the device will be capable of other than tracking blood sugar and heart-rate. The suggestion of a standalone health product makes sense, seeing that Tim Cook said last year that future health products would separate from the Watch in an effort to avoid FDA approvals slowing the pace of Watch innovation. Tim Cook has increasingly touted the fitness and wellness capabilities of Apple’s product lineup, making a handful of improvements to the features with the upcoming launch of iOS 10 and watchOS 3.

Thursday, August 11, 2016 · 10:35 am · 11 Comments “The day before Apple reported earnings,an analyst came out with a bold statement and recommended investors sell Apple before going into earnings on July 26. He also cut his price target from $110 per share down to $85 per share with a Sell rating slapped on for good measure. He said, ‘Apple has peaked under the leadership of CEO Tim Cook,'” Jay Somaney writes for Forbes. “I am not a fan of Tim Cook’s leadership skills either however that research report seemed unduly harsh as far as the rating and price target.” “The next day, Apple reported earnings and investors realized that things were not as bad as the sellsiders were expecting and the guidance was even slightly higher which is very atypical of Apple’s usual subdued forecasts,” Somaney writes. “Apple shares are up almost 11.5% in the two weeks or so since that report and have not looked back. So, the question for investors is whether the worst is behind us and is Apple stock ready to continue climbing higher into the launch of the iPhone7 in early September?” Apple Analysts are “now sheepishly trying to put out optimistic reports on Apple post its June quarter results and combined with the success of Tim Cook’s trip to India and China, things for Apple and its investors have finally started looking up, no?” Somaney writes. “Finally, maybe, just maybe, peak Apple was just a pipe dream for the dark side (shorts)?” Read more in the full article here.

Michael Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 4:23 pm · Reply Tim Cook is working very hard to make the company sustainable after growing at such a rapid pace over the past several years. Sorry but when you are growing that fast it is far more difficult to “innovate”. Steve Jobs’ Apple was hailed as “innovative” because they were able to change directions on a dime. They were a fraction of the size they are now with a user base an order of magnitude smaller. More effort has to be put into getting the product into the customers hands than ever before. They’re not making millions of products, they’re producing hundreds of millions of them. Furthermore, Tim Cook is passionate and speaks about EVERYONE’s rights regarding, privacy, security, equality, safety, etc. It’s your feeble homophobic mind that you ONLY see the “gay” issue. He’s also extremely passionate about education, the environment, AND customer satisfaction (he mentions this all the time). veritas Friday, August 12, 2016 - 10:52 am · Reply Me thinks thou dost protest too much… Come out of the closet, it’s ok.

The analysts were saying that Tin Cook and Apple had lost their mojo and therefore the company performance was expected to decline. When the results were announced and demonstrated that Apple had been doing quite nicely after all, the analysts try to claim that it’s down to Apple suddenly getting it’s mojo back. It may have escaped the attention of the analysts ( and let’s be fair, much does escape their attention ), but if the results for the last three months were OK, then that mojo must have ‘returned’ more than three months ago without the analysts even noticing, or to put it another way, the mojo was there all along, but completely unseen by those whose job it is to spot such things. Joe Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 11:35 am · Reply He said, “Apple has peaked under the leadership of CEO Tim Cook.” Well, he nailed that part. iPhone sales were down, iPad sales were down, Mac sales were down. With all of this bad news, who could have predicted that the price of Apple stock would go up? What the analyst failed to do was predict how well Apple could spin all the bad news. With Tim Cook at the helm, it is going to get harder and harder to spin. peterblood71 Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 4:24 pm · Reply Only for the repetitious idjit trolls like you. jambro Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 2:04 pm · Reply Cook is lost without Jobs as Captain. Jobs was passionate about making great products. Cook is passionate about social and gay issues and ignores Apple. So yeah, Apple is lost. peterblood71 Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 4:26 pm · Reply Well until they’re miraculously “found” again with new products, updates and soaring sales, eh?

An Apple wearable heart reader may be its next big thing 0 Wearable Tech by Katie Collins August 11, 2016 5:32 AM PDT @katiecollins Up Next Pokemon Go tracking finally goes live and actually works The device could be worn either on the wrist, or another part of the body. Photo by Apple/US Patent and Trademark Office Apple is increasingly concerned about your health. The company, after all, believes the Apple Watch is already buzzing you out of your lazy stupor. CEO Tim Cook says that "sitting is the new cancer" and that his products can be a solution. Apple may be heading even further into the medical field. A patent application published Thursday by the US Patent and Trademark Office shows that Apple wants to lock down ownership on a new wearable health device that could be fashioned into different accessories. It could, for example, be a watch, a ring, a brooch or something else entirely. The application was uncovered by Patently Apple. The wearable, capable of performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) to measure the heart's rhythm, could allow Apple to tap into the $148 billion US market for medical devices. It would serve as a logical progression from the Apple Watch, a more mainstream product that has kick-started the idea of wearing bits of connected technology. The burgeoning wearables market is expected to be worth $25 billion by 2019, according to CCS Insight. While other companies such as Samsung, LG and Sony came out with smartwatches before Apple, the Apple Watch leads the pack. And although the iPhone remains the primary driver of revenue, Apple is eager to branch out with new products. While an ECG-capable ring or brooch would be a niche item, it would be critical for cardiology tests. Usually, ECG readings differ depending on the distance of the device from the heart, but the device that Apple wants to patent describes a calibration process that means it can calculate accurate readings no matter where the device is on the body. Sounds great, right? Just don't hold your breath for one to show up soon. Big tech companies file many patent applications, but it doesn't necessarily mean they're currently working on that particular concept or product, or that it will ever see the light of day. Still, Apple has an eye on your well-being. "If you think about some of society's biggest problems and challenges, one of the ones that we are really focused on is health," Cook said at Startup Fest Europe in Amsterdam in May. It doesn't hurt that the issue could drive sales of its products too. Apple declined to comment.

That time is now. Coming a month or so before the next iPhone release, many people want to know how the current-year Galaxy Note sizes up with the latest iPhone Plus – which, at this point, is going on a year old. So be sure to add many grains of salt: It's the 2016 Samsung Galaxy Note 7 vs. the 2015 iPhone 6s Plus. Size We aren't sure if it's more about how impressive it is that Samsung squeezed a big screen into a smaller device, or how unimpressive it is that Apple, a company known for minimal and efficient design, keeps releasing phones with so much space wasted on "chin" and "forehead." Despite having the bigger screen, the Galaxy Note 7 comes out 3 percent shorter and 5 percent narrower than the iPhone 6s Plus. Weight The smaller Note 7 also comes out 12 percent lighter. Build We were impressed with the Note 7's build at our event hands-on. On paper, it's the same glass and aluminum design Samsung has been using on its flagships since the Galaxy S6, but in hand this one feels better than ever, with rounded edges that could be easily mistaken for an all-glass build. Colors You have four color options for each phone. Display size The Galaxy Note 7 has a 7 percent bigger screen than the iPhone – and, again, remember that the Note is still the smaller handset. Display resolution The Note 7's screen is also 29 percent sharper, based on pixel density. The iPhone's 1080p screen still looks great, but the Galaxy's QHD resolution gives it an extra eye candy pop. HDR display Samsung's new screen is also capable of displaying HDR content, with a wide range between the lightest lights and the darkest darks. Display type It's the familiar AMOLED vs. IPS on the display panel front. Always-on display The Note 7 gives you the option of leaving its screen on while it sits on your desk, showing things like time, date and number of text messages on an otherwise black display. Curved display Unless you count the Galaxy Note Edge from two years ago, the Note 7 is the first primary Galaxy Note flagship with a curved screen. Those curves slope off a bit closer to the edge than on Samsung's previous Edge phones, though, combining with the curved back to give it that smooth rounded-edge feel. Stylus It wouldn't be a Galaxy Note without the S Pen stylus. This year the stylus is narrower, doubles its levels of pressure sensitivity over the last two models and gets its own IP68 water resistance. Samsung also added its annual set of new software-based features, including a quick translate option that lets you instantly convert a word from one language to another (just by hovering the pen over it), a GIF creation tool and a magnification tool. Pressure-sensitive display Apple's 3D Touch, which gives you iOS shortcuts by pressing deeper on the screen, has yet to be widely copied on the Android side of the aisle. Iris scanner The Galaxy Note 7 is the first mainstream flagship that lets you unlock it with your eyes. Fingerprint sensors, which require next to no effort, do most of the same things the iris scanner does, though, so we're skeptical about whether this neat-sounding new trick is something you'll want to go out of your way to get. Fingerprint sensor In addition to the iris scanner, the Note still keeps its fingerprint sensor home button as a backup. Water resistance This is the first Galaxy Note to have water resistance. Its IP68 rating means it can soak continuously in 1 m (3.3 ft) of water. Camera megapixels On paper, camera resolutions are identical. But if the new Note ends up using the same sensor as the Galaxy S7 pair (it looks like it does), then it will have the better rear camera. As we said at the top, though, that's hardly surprising given the Note is a year-newer flagship. Camera aperture (rear) Part of Samsung's superior camera quality is its low-light shooting prowess, which is largely tied to its wider aperture. OIS Both of these handsets have Optical Image Stabilization. Battery The Note 7 has a 27 percent bigger battery, which might suggest longer battery life, but we'll wait for our review benchmark before saying anything definitive on that front. Fast charging If there's one feature we think Apple "needs" to add with its next iPhones, it's some form of fast-charging. This has been a huge advantage for Android flagships for the last two years. Wireless charging The Note 7 also gives you the option of charging wirelessly. Processor The Note 7's Snapdragon 820 benchmarks a bit faster than the A9 in the 6s series, but we wouldn't be surprised if the iPhone 7 ended up being a little faster than the new Note, which is using an early 2016 CPU. RAM The Note doubles the iPhone's RAM, though iOS' excellent memory management means it still gives you silky-smooth multitasking. Storage The Note 7 quadruples the entry-level iPhone's storage. Actually, you can scratch what we said a minute ago: The single biggest feature the next iPhone needs is more than a measly 16 GB storage in the base-level tier. MicroSD The Galaxy also lets you augment its internal storage by popping in a microSD card. Mobile payments Both phones let you pay for stuff by holding the handsets up to a terminal. But Samsung Pay has an advantage over Apple Pay, in that Samsung's service can simulate the swiping of a credit card at regular payment stations that don't support Apple's required NFC. Gear VR Apple has yet to toy with the world of virtual reality (at least publicly). The Note 7 unlocks the best selection of mobile VR apps, once you plug it into Samsung's latest Gear VR. Software The Galaxy Note 7 launches with Android Marshmallow (with a generous layer of Samsung TouchWiz on top), but will likely get Android Nougat not too terribly long after its public release. The iPhone runs iOS 9 until next month, when iOS 10 launches. Release The Note 7 is up for pre-order now, and hits store shelves on August 19. This is a terrible time to buy the iPhone 6s Plus, at least at anything close to full price. A month from now, we should already know about the next pair of iPhones. Starting price (full retail) At this point, this is our biggest concern about the Note 7. In a world where you can buy a high-end flagship for US$399, Samsung actually jacked up the Note's price by $100. Is the justification the iris scanner? Water resistance? Extra storage? It's not that the Note didn't strike us as a terrific, ultra-premium phone in our event demo, it's more that its quality to price ratio could hold back our overall recommendation.

(AAPL) and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) BABA and NVDA look ready to run higher, but keep an eye on APPL Aug 11, 2016, 10:28 am EST  |  By Johnson Research Group     The S&P 500’s ability to move above the top of its range is causing some concern among traders, especially since this August rally has gone against the historically weak seasonality that the month is well-known for. This morning’s technical landscape is starting to fill up with a number of potentially bullish breakouts, although there is one popular stock that the short-term technicals are starting to concern us. The Trinity of Technology for today includes two bulls and one bear: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Alibaba released a positive earnings report this morning, sending shares about 5% higher in the premarket trading. The shares have been entrenched in a technically strengthening rally that kicked-off in June and now has shares of the online retailer moving to their highest point in the last year. 7 Dividend-Paying Energy Stocks to Tap Into Now! What is more interesting about the move in the shares is that they broke above their top Bollinger Band yesterday, ahead of earnings. It suggests that the market was “buying the rumor,” which can sometimes be bad, but not likely here. Alibaba stock has a large amount of short interest positioned against it, which makes the Bollinger Band break increasingly bullish as the shorts are now facing growing losses. Technical analysts love it when a bullish chart forms and short interest is high, as it triggers a short covering rally. Right now, the charts look open to $104 for Alibaba shares. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Apple Inc. is on the other side of our list today. The stock has done well lately, rallying more than 17% from its June lows, but the rally has extended Apple shares to a likely turning point. Apple stock entered oversold territory in early August, and for a while looked like the shares would defy gravity. Now, we’re seeing a slowdown in the momentum of the shares at the same time that it continues to hover in oversold territory. In Apple’s case, traders may be holding on a while longer, as the company will reveal their newest products in about a month, but you have to remember that their “reveals” have under-impressed investors. Apple shares are trading just below their April highs that were around $110, but the momentum is shifting and trader will start to sweat a little and think about locking in a nice gain from the shares’ short-term bull run. In addition to April highs, Apple stock will face pressure from its 20-month moving average, which is at $112 and declining. For now, the technical balance of power is moving in favor of the Apple bears, though you’ll have a chance to trade this on bullishly soon. Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Nvidia is preparing their earnings release for this afternoon after the close. This stock has been a juggernaut in the market with a whopping 148% in gains over the last 12 months. The growth has been steady, except for when they announce earnings, when Nvidia shares tend to jump higher. We just preached the dangers of an overbought stock, but in Nvidia’s case overbought can and has led to even more overbought situations. As pointed out, this stock has defied gravity. Alibaba: Earnings Propel BABA Stock to New Highs The stock pulled back from the $60 level over the last few days, which is good as it suggests that some traders are paring back positions ahead of the report instead of buying the rumor. Either way, we’re interested in this stock from a technical perspective. An earnings miss this afternoon will cause a quick reversal and pullback to the $52 level, at which point the technical traders will step in at the 50-day support. A beat will continue the march higher into fresh new high territory. As of this writing, the Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Bloomberg first caught wind of Doll’s re-hiring this morning, based on his recently updated LinkedIn profile revealing his new position at Apple: Director of Health Software Engineering. He starter at Apple last month, as per LinkedIn, which doesn’t expand further on his role. During his nearly-six-year tenure at the Cupertino firm as Senior iPhone Engineer from 2003 to 2009, he helped develop the original iPhone’s operating system before leaving the company to co-found Flipboard with Mike McCue. He left Flipboard in September 2015. Apple recently hired Sage Bionetworks founder and Merck & Co. veteran Stephen Friend and former Nest Labs technology chief Yoky Matsuoka, who joined the company’s growing health team. According to industry sources who recently spoke with Taiwan’s Economic Daily News, Apple is working on a “killer new health-tracking gadget” that will use 3D Touch, debut in 2017 and “set off a new whirlwind” within the technology industry.

(Reuters/Stephen Lam) Share Written by Joon Ian Wong Obsession Messaging August 11, 2016 Apple’s App Store catalogue is exploding, and this will only strengthen the hold existing top apps have over users. The number of apps hosted on Apple’s platform is set to increase by 50% this year, from just over 2 million, according to estimates by research firm Sensor Tower. By 2020, the total number of apps will hit 5 million, or more than double the current amount. Back in 2009, the App Store had just 5,000 apps. It was relatively easy for users to browse Apple’s categories and find the ones they wanted to install. The picture today is very different. Smartphone users already devote almost all their time on their devices to just their top five apps, according to ComScore. Half a user’s time on her smartphone is spent in just one app, the same ComScore survey found. Here’s what that looks like charted: There’s a good chance that those top five apps belong to either Facebook or Google, although Google Play isn’t available to Apple’s iOS users, since it’s a portal for Android apps. Apple has taken note of the crowded app landscape. It’s opening up new ways for app publishers to make money, like through subscriptions. It’s also creating more fine-grained categories, like “Shopping,” and letting publishers advertise their wares within the App Store. Sensor Tower thinks an artificial intelligence-powered App Store assistant may be one solution Apple could try out in its effort to spread user attention across millions more apps in the near future. In the meantime, publishers must think of creative ways to get in front of users, including sneaking under the radar with novel keyboards, or hooking them with funny or glamorous stickers, as Kim Kardashian’s Kimoji app has demonstrated.
