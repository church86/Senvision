The iPhone hack was limited to the 3G model from 2008. In a statement late Thursday, Apple said the flaw was fixed with the release of the iPhone 3GS a year later. Apple also said the Mac vulnerabilities were all fixed in all Macs launched after 2013. Apple's statement was consistent with assessments from security experts, who say that many of the apparent vulnerabilities were in older technology. Apple is going further in saying those flaws have all been fixed, based on its preliminary analysis. Security experts say the exploits described in the WikiLeaks documents are plausible, but suggest they pose little threat to typical users. Besides being likely out of date, the techniques also typically require physical access to devices, something the CIA would use only for targeted individuals, not a broader population. The CIA has not commented on the authenticity of this and earlier WikiLeaks revelations, but has previously said it complies with a legal prohibition against electronic surveillance "targeting individuals here at home, including our fellow Americans." Also Read: WikiLeaks: CIA hacked Apple devices in ways users can't fix The leaks Thursday came about two weeks after WikiLeaks published thousands of alleged CIA documents describing hacking tools it said the government employed to break into computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs from companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. WikiLeaks has offered to share further details with tech companies to help them fix flaws, though accepting such information might subject companies to certain conditions and put government contracts at risk. Apple addressed the offer for the first time in Thursday's statement. "We have not negotiated with WikiLeaks for any information," the statement read. "We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn't in the public domain."Apple said that while it takes users' security and privacy seriously, "we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users."Earlier, Microsoft said WikiLeaks had made initial contact through its public reporting channel, "and we have followed up, treating them as we would any other finder." Mozilla, the organisation behind the Firefox web browser, also said it had been contacted through the email address it uses for security vulnerability reporting. Mozilla said it would take steps necessary to fix any vulnerabilities reported that way.

Apple's dock would use the iPhone as a touchpad. Credit: USPTOMore Apple's dock would use the iPhone as a touchpad. Credit: USPTO The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Thursday (Mar. 23) published an Apple patent filing describing a method by which you would place an iPhone into a MacBook chassis and power the computing device with an iPhone. The smartphone would be strategically placed in about the same spot as a touchpad would on a regular Mac. Could Apple be planning such a move for the iPhone 8? The patent application, which was earlier discovered by AppleInsider, is called, simply, "Electronic accessory device." It says that the chassis would come with traditional computing parts, including a screen, keyboard, and GPU. But in order for it to actually be powered, you'd need to insert the iPhone into it and start working on the device as if it were a computer. MORE: iPhone 8 Camera Will Be All About AR, and Glasses Are Next The patent application is notable, given the rise of 2-in-1 hybrids that can act both as tablets and notebooks, effectively blurring the line between tablets and PCs. But no company has successfully married the phone and laptop yet. HP's Elite X3 is the most recent example, which connects to a laptop-like dock using Windows 10 Mobile's Continuum feature. Previous attempts to combine phone and laptop have included the ill-fated Palm Foleo and the Motorola Atrix Laptop Dock. Samsung doesn't look to be going the mobile route with its Galaxy S8, but it's expected to offer an optional desktop dock called DeX that could power 4K monitors, as well as a mouse and keyboard. Apple has conspicuously shied away from this kind of convergence and has said on numerous occasions that it believes there is -- and should be -- a clear distinction between mobile experiences and computing experiences. The latest patent application, however, suggests Apple is at least thinking about ways to bridge that gap. Specifically, the patent application calls for a way for data to be transferred between the devices. Additionally, the host device could have its own operating system installed, allowing you to simply use the iPhone's processor for power and access alternative software that would be running on the device. But it goes further. In a striking move, Apple's patent describes a touchscreen for the host device -- a feature we've yet to see in an Apple computer and something the company's executives say, doesn't work in the computing space. Another embodiment in the device sees an iPad acting as its screen. It's not clear whether a device like this will ever make its way to store shelves. Like other big companies, Apple files for patents on a slew of technologies, and many of them are never released. But an iPhone-powered laptop is definitely an intriguing idea.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Mobile Technology iPad (2017) vs. iPad Pro 9.7 Will Shanklin March 24, 2017 New Atlas compares the features and specs of the new iPad (2017) and iPad Pro 9.7 View gallery - 20 images Apple's new iPad marks a new budget-minded strategy for Apple's tablet line. The company still, however, has a high-end iPad that falls in the same 10-inch window. Let's compare the features and specs of the entry-level iPad with the high-end iPad Pro 9.7. Size Sick of Ads? Join more than 500 New Atlas Plus subscribers who read our newsletter and website without ads. It's just US$19 a year.More Information Height and width are identical, as they have been since 2013's iPad Air. That's good news for anyone who owns a snap-on cover or keyboard cover, as there's a good chance they'll fit both of these models. (Cases might be another story, as the iPads have different depths.) Weight Presumably in the name of keeping the price down, the new iPad gained a little heft over both the iPad Pro 9.7 and its predecessor, the iPad Air 2. Build The new model still has Apple's familiar aluminum unibody design. Apple keyboard It isn't included in the box (be ready to pony up an extra US$150), but the iPad Pro plays nice with a snap-on Apple Smart Keyboard that doesn't rely on a Bluetooth connection. The cheaper iPad only works with third-party Bluetooth keyboards. Apple Pencil The new model also won't work the Apple Pencil stylus. Colors Apparently Apple decided customers could live without rose gold in the new iPad. Display size No changes here, it's 9.7 inches both ways. Display resolution Fortunately there's no compromise in pixels for the cheaper new model, with the same "Retina" resolution found in all 9.7-in iPads since early 2012. Display type Until that alleged 10th-anniversary iPhone switches to AMOLED later this year (as it's rumored to), Apple sticks with IPS panels in all its mobile devices. True Tone display The iPad Pro 9.7 is still the only Apple device with a True Tone display, which adjusts its color balance in response to your ambience. (It's all in the sensors.) Chip This is a nice upgrade in the new iPad (compared to the iPad Air 2, not the Pro), in that it gets a same-generation system-on-a-chip as the iPhone 6s and iPad Pro. Not being the A9X variant of the A9, though, it's probably not going to benchmark quite as fast as the Pro. (Note that we're grabbing the 1.85 GHz from the iPhone 6s version of the A9 chip; it's possible it will be clocked differently in the new iPad.) RAM We won't know the RAM situation in the new iPad until we run some benchmarks, but we'd be surprised if the didn't use the same 2 GB as the iPad Air 2 and Pro 9.7. Battery Apple rates the same 10 hours of web-surfing, video or music-listening (while on Wi-Fi) for both models. Cellular option You can pay an extra $130 to get an LTE-enabled model of either tablet. Storage The only difference here is a 256 GB variant of the Pro 9.7. Camera megapixels The iPad Pro has better cameras, though we don't think many shoppers are too worried about that in a large-ish tablet. Touch ID Both have Touch ID fingerprint sensors. Speakers The iPad Pro gives you an extra pair of stereo speakers, for a more surround-like experience while watching videos or playing games. Software Both run iOS 10. Release The 2017 iPad is up for pre-order, and starts shipping next week. While it's now a year old, it doesn't look like the iPad Pro 9.7 is ready to be replaced by a successor just yet. (Rumors point to a 10.5-in iPad Pro with the same tablet size sometime this year.) Starting price (full retail) When the iPad Pro 9.7 launched a year ago, we wished it started at the same $499 as every one of its same-sized predecessors. But that pricey pill may be a little easier to swallow with its affordable new sibling. If you can live with a Bluetooth keyboard instead of an Apple-connected one (or skip the keyboard altogether), then the $329 iPad may be all you need. We'll have a more definitive take on the new iPad, though, when we run our full review. Until then, you can revisit our review of the iPad Pro 9.7. Correction: The original version of this article had checks and Xs backwards in the images for Apple Keyboard and Apple Pencil.

Apple’s website is currently down in preparation for the sales, which are scheduled to start at 11:01 AM EDT today. Don't Miss: Netflix has 25 new originals set for release in April – here’s the full list Apple earlier this week announced a brand new iPhone 7 color, a new iPad, minor iPhone SE and iPad mini updates, and a slew of accessories. You can check out every single new product Apple announced right here. The red iPhone 7, part of Apple’s PRODUCT (RED) campaign, looks amazing — check out a hands-on unboxing video at this link. Other than the red color though, nothing changes inside the phone. The red iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus each come with only two storage options, including 128GB and 256GB, just like the Jet Black versions. Prices start at $749 for the 128GB iPhone 7. The brand new 9.7-inch iPad replaces Apple’s iPad Air 2, and it looks like Apple is killing the Air brand across product ranges. The device features a better A9 processor and a better screen, and it comes in 32GB and 128GB versions. The new iPad is available in silver, gold, and space gray, and ships in the expected Wi-Fi-only and Wi-Fi + Cellular options. Prices start at $329 for the 32GB iPad, which is the lowest entry price ever for a brand new 9.7-inch iPad. Even a new iPad mini is more expensive, starting at $399, but the mini only comes with 128GB of storage. The refreshed iPad mini, as well as Apple’s new iPhone and Apple Watch accessories, are also available to purchase from Apple’s online store.

Given that Apple has not done a (Product) RED launch with an iPhone before, it did come as a surprise albeit a nice one since the red finish is rather eye-catching. The good news is that if you liked what you saw, then you’ll be pleased to learn that the phone is now available for purchase. We should point out that this is merely just a new coat of paint and that the innards and features are pretty much the same as every iPhone 7 or 7 Plus model. However the main difference is that part of the proceeds from the sales of the (Product) RED iPhone 7 will be going towards the Global Fund to support HIV/AIDS programs, so you will be doing your part for charity and society, if that’s your kind of thing. In terms of pricing, it does appear to be more expensive than the regular iPhone 7. The base model is priced starting at $749 versus the regular iPhone 7 simply because there is no 32GB option and it will be only available in 128GB and 256GB configurations. This is the same as the (Product) RED iPhone 7 Plus which starts at $869 for the 128GB model. However if you were planning on getting the 128GB model anyway then we guess there’s no real difference in price. We’re not sure if this (Product) RED iPhone 7 will be a limited run or if it will be always available, but if you’d rather not take that risk then head on over to Apple’s Online Store to make your purchase. At this time of writing the estimated shipping times on both models are set at 1 day. Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about iPhone and iphone 7.

His two daughters were by his side. We published Mr. Kaylin’s obituary at this link. This column by Randall Beach, Walter Kaylin’s son-in-law, was first published March 11 in the New Haven Register and on the NHRegister.com at this link, “Randall Beach: The amazing Walter Kaylin, already a legend,” We are pleased to republish it here with the permission of the New Haven Register. Walter Kaylin 06.28.1921 – 02.15.2017 When I picked up the ashes of my father-in-law, Walter Kaylin, last Monday morning at the crematorium in Wallingford and drove back to New Haven with him beside me, I thought about his wonderful life and his never-ending stories. Listen, you would have to expect vivid, funny stories from a guy whose wild tales were in anthologies entitled “He-Men, Bag Men & Nymphos” and “Weasels Ripped My Flesh.” Walter wrote those during the late 1950s and ‘60s for pulp magazines such as “For Men Only,” “True Action” and “Stag.” He spun sagas of macho men on dangerous tropical islands rescuing damsels and plugging the bad guys. Many of them were war-related. Check out the title of his contribution to “Men” magazine, July 1966: “The Black Lace Blonde, the Yank Jungle Fighters and the Chicom Plot to Grab the Mid-Pacific.” Walter’s colleagues in that New York City office were other tough-nut writers such as Mario Puzo, who would go on to write “The Godfather” and Joseph Heller, who later wrote “Catch-22.” Bruce Jay Friedman, another of Walter’s peers, noted Walter was nothing like the characters he concocted. “He looked like a divinity student, always buttoned up,” Friedman recalled on the backside of one of Walter’s anthologies. “Then the stories would come in. They were special — seamless and outrageous and wonderful. I think of him as a treasure.” But Walter didn’t achieve the literary fame later accorded to those other writers. His two books, “The Power Forward” and “Another Time, Another Woman,” didn’t sell and quickly went out of print. But at the age of 92, when he was living at Apple Rehab in Guilford, unable to walk, Walter saw those two anthologies get published, thanks to pulp fiction enthusiasts Robert Deis and Wyatt Doyle. “It means a lot to me,” Walter told me when I asked him how it felt to finally get such recognition. But he never took himself too seriously. He added with a sly smile, “I was reading those stories in bed last night and I was shocked at how savage they were. I was thinking, ‘My God! Could this be me?’” Walter got a lot of his source material during World War II, when he was a radio operator in the Signal Corps of the U.S. Army, stationed in the Philippines. He didn’t see much combat but he met a lot of unforgettable guys and “dames.” He recalled they were gorgeous, “all of them with mouthfuls of gold teeth.” Because Walter grew up in the Bronx near Yankee Stadium, he watched Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in action. When Gehrig was mired in a batting slump, Walter wrote him a letter, telling him not to worry, the hits would soon start coming again. Gehrig wrote back, thanking him. I wish Walter had held onto that reply. But he certainly remembered it well. Even when he was in his 90s, in a bed or his chair at the Guilford rehab center, he could still recall seeing those fabled Yankees and others of that era — Jackie Robinson, Willie Mays — playing for the local ball clubs. He also told us he saw Satchel Paige pitch after that star in the Negro leagues finally got a chance to play in the majors. Walter and his wife, Peggy Kaylin, loved living in New York but they also enjoyed getting out of town with their young daughters, Jennifer and Lucy. In the late 1950s, they began spending weekends in a beach-side cottage in Old Lyme. Eventually, they got weary of the Sunday night drives back to the city and they moved to Old Lyme to live there year-round. But Walter never stopped writing. Jennifer, the woman I married, recalls hearing him typing away in a room adjacent to the kitchen and later in his office upstairs, where he had an expansive view of the shoreline. When he wanted to take a break from his writing, he walked into the sun room on the first floor, sat down at the piano and played in his unique style: a rolling, rollicking, free-wheeling boogie woogie outpouring that was delightful. During his four years at Apple Rehab, he kept a succession of typewriters in his room and he was constantly thinking of story ideas, then getting them most of down on paper. We have been sorting through his many correspondences and story fragments and came upon a letter he wrote to an editor at “The New Yorker” magazine. “At age 90 I’m working on a highly unusual novel,” he wrote. “‘Hear the Chant of the Jungle’ centers on the relationship between 23-year-old Paulie Ohlbaum of the Bronx and a considerably older, incredibly tall Watusi woman, Roz, who emerged from Rwanda (Congo) to take care of him for the first two years of his life, then disappeared and has rematerialized 20 years later. By this time Paulie and his older brother, Luther, own and run a motel, Owl’s Eye, in Connecticut, on the Sound.” Walter went on for a couple of pages, continuing to weave the imaginative scenario. He concluded the letter: “Does this interest you? If so, I’d be happy to send you the first section, which concludes with Roz getting set to meet Paulie for the first time in 20 years.” We couldn’t find the editor’s response, if there was one. But it didn’t matter much to Walter. He kept writing anyway, up until the final week or two of his life. That’s an inspiration for all of us to keep going. He also kept playing the piano. Apple Rehab has a community room where residents gather and there’s a piano in the corner. Walter spent a lot of time seated there in his wheelchair, entertaining everyone within earshot. Over the last year or two, Walter would sometimes hold up the bent, arthritic fingers of his right hand and complain he couldn’t play piano as freely as he had in previous years. But that never stopped him. He loved movies, especially the classics from his prime. A month or two ago, my wife and I went to Best Video and rented “The Treasure of the Sierra Madre” for him. We watched it together at Apple. After it ended, Walter exclaimed, “That was some picture!” It would be the last one he ever saw. We also supplied Walter with Heaven Hill, his favorite Bourbon whiskey. He always enjoyed a little glass of it just before dinner time. That community room, and I’m sure all of Apple Rehab itself, is quieter now, some of the life gone out of it. There are many people, besides us, who miss hearing Walter play and miss his stories. His four grandkids, who he was so proud of, also dearly miss him. My younger daughter Charlotte posted a message that ended: “Papa, the world is already a little less cool without you.” He made it to 95. As he often told us in his final year, he had done enough. He was ready to go. His wife had died in 2010. Walter had few regrets; he didn’t dwell on such stuff. He had enjoyed life. For many years, he had sat with Peggy on the beach, sipping cocktails while listening to his jazz records playing from inside their home. As he watched the sun slowly set over the water, Walter always said, “It doesn’t get any better than this.” One day this spring we will scatter his ashes in that idyllic playground where life couldn’t get any better.

Their renewable energy projects will produce over 12 MW of solar power — more than the energy they need for Apple manufacturing — and support Japan’s nationwide efforts to limit its carbon emissions. “These innovative new clean energy investments demonstrate our commitment to doing business responsibly and economically,” said Kyoichi Yamanaka, Managing Director of Ibiden’s Environment Group. “Our products help Apple devices run smarter, and now we’re powering our operations with smarter energy too. We’re pleased to partner with Apple and lead the way in helping Japan meet its clean energy goals.” Apple and its suppliers will be generating over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy for the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018 — equal to taking over 400,000 cars off the road for a year. Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 percent of its operations in 23 countries, and more than 93 percent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

By Jana Kasperkevic • Mar 24, 2017 Related Program:  Marketplace TweetShareGoogle+Email A sticker with the (RED) logo is seen on an iPhone box Jana Kasperkevic Apple’s new iPhone 7 — a distinctly colored red iPhone — is on sale today. The newest iPhone is a collaboration between Apple and Bono’s (RED) Campaign, but while the phone is connected to a charitable cause, it may also mean a bump in sales. "To be honest, when consumers walk into one of the carriers, they won't probably even be aware that the initiative is going on,” said Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA research. About 90 percent of iPhones are sold through the carriers, he said. Apple has previously seen a boost in demand when it rolled out iPhone in jet-black and rose colors. "This is just the next step of Apple looking to extend the color options for consumers." The latest version of the iPhone now comes in six colors — red, black, jet black, gold, rose and white. However, only higher-memory phones come in red, which could potentially limit sales, Zino said. The (RED) campaign raises funds to fight HIV/AIDS and is a division of the ONE campaign, which was also co-founded by the U2 frontman. It was launched in 2006 with Apple, Motorola and Gap as its corporate partners. The height of the campaign's popularity was marked with a "Do the (RED) Thing" line of Gap T-shirts launched to mark World AIDS Day that year. The shirts were emblazoned with words such as discove(red), empowe(red) and ado(red). Apple’s 10-year-long collaboration with the campaign has been more subtle, lacking the obvious (red) branding. Instead, Apple sells products in a deep red color, donating a portion of the sales to the campaign. The products include nano and shuffle iPods, Beats headphones and speaker, and an Apple Watch.  Typically, Apple donates a majority of the funds raised by the campaign to the Global Fund, according to the company, with the exception of those used for administrative expenses. Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures, said he expects Apple to sell between 12 million to 24 million red iPhones in the next year — that will account for 5 percent to 10 percent of the iPhones sold. But, he said, the new color is probably not about driving sales. Related: How long can Apple depend on iPhone sales? Are we getting bored with phone upgrades? “Apple released the red iPhone to genuinely give back," he explained. "The color red is not strong enough to measurably increase demand. And they need to do it infrequently to maintain product red's appeal.” For example, when it first partnered with the (RED) campaign in 2006, Apple launched a limited-edition red nano iPod. Proceeds from Apple’s (RED) products and promotions account for 28 percent of the funds raised by the campaign. “(RED) has generated more than $465 million for the Global Fund, with more than $130 million from Apple alone,” according to Tuesday’s press release. The global aid organizations supported by (RED) funding efforts have a complicated history and have drawn scrutiny for over five years due to allegations of fraud and corruption. The (RED) campaign itself drew criticism one year after launching for spending more on advertising than it raised. A year later, the New York Times reported that the funds raised by (RED) allowed the Global Fund to shift funds to other programs and to increase its visibility. Then in 2011, the fund’s internal inspector general’s office uncovered corruption, including drugs sold on the black market, forged documents and improper bookkeeping practices. In response, the fund pulled or suspended grants from nations where corruption was found. Most recently, in April 2016, the U.S. Senate launched an inquiry into the fund’s anti-corruption practices and the firing of the inspector general who published the reports alleging corruption. Related: Apple reports record profits in first quarter Apple fights to sell used iPhones in India Despite the corruption allegations, Munster sees Apple’s association with the Global Fund as a plus. “It benefits Apple to work with the Global Fund. Tim Cook has shown that he cares about the betterment of people, and we believe his participation in the Global Fund is genuine,” Munster said. “There is no doubt that Apple does its homework on the Global Fund and views it as a good partner.” TweetShareGoogle+Email View the discussion thread. © 2017 West Virginia Public Broadcasting Contact Us About Us Site Map Privacy Public Information Contests & Rules Underwriting

(AP) Commerce and Industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman today said Amercian phone-maker Apple’s demand for tax incentives to set up a manufacturing unit in the country will have be looked at after the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is rolled out. “GST will be coming soon. So, tax-related incentives demanded by Apple will have to be looked from a different angle,” Sitharaman told PTI on the sidelines of Chemexcil function here. The government has not accepted most of the demands of the iPhone maker, she added. Apple plans to set up a manufacturing unit in Bengaluru this year, where it will assemble its products, probably only iPhone 6 and 6s models, according to reports in a section of the media. The American tech giant has sought various concessions on taxation and import of components for setting up the unit. The Cupertino-based technology giant currently manufactures in China and Brazil. Apart from tax sops, Apple also wants relaxation in the mandated 30% local sourcing of components. Earlier reports had said the company would be importing all its components on the grounds that it is bringing in cutting-edge technology to the country. Apple also wants to open a fully-owned retail outlets in the country. In January, Apple had indicated to the government that it was ready with a blueprint to begin manufacturing iPhones, but wants fiscal concessions, including Customs duty waiver on imported components. tags Apple Inc GST Nirmala Sitharaman China Brazil more from business Bharti Airtel sells 10% stake in tower unit to KKR, Canada Pension Mar 28, 2017 10:58 IST China’s HNA in talks to buy controlling stake in Forbes Mar 28, 2017 10:34 IST FD vs Stocks: Which One Should You Choose?

When looking at Q4/2016, the Apple iPhone 7 was the 2016 best-seller, followed by iPhone 7 Plus, based on research from the IHS Markit smart phone Shipment Database, which tracks quarterly data for more than 350 smart phone models. The Santa Carla based-company has shown to the industry that its iPhone 2016 models integrate enough innovations and new features to drive sales and remain successful in the mobile market. Apple is also capable of selling older smart phones for an extended period of time. For instance, the year-old iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus were both among the most-shipped smart phone models in 2016. Best Samsung smart phones 2016 The popular Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and Galaxy S7 ranked fifth and ninth, respectively. Sales of these two smart phones in 2016 have outperformed their predecessors, Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge: the combined shipments of S7 and S7 Edge in 2016 were 10 million higher than Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge over the same period. The Samsung Galax Note 7 recall has left S7 and S7 Edge, released in March 2016, the best smart phones in the premium line-up of Samsung Electronics. Since 2016, the international market has seen a series of premium smart phones by other companies. Samsung’s ability to drive the sales of older premium smart phones was impressive. Samsung Mobile claimed five spots out of the top 10 best smart phones in 2016. Best Huawei phones Huawei, the third largest smart phone manufacturer after Apple and Samsung, did not have any smart phone models in the top 10 most-shipped phones in 2016. However, Huawei continues to address multiple smart phone pricing segments - either with its own Huawei-branded mobile handsets or with those of its sub-brand, Honor. In the premium smart phone segment, Huawei’s P9 was among its own top five best smart phone in 2016, performing better shipments than previous flagship smart phones. Best phones 2016 Chinese manufacturer OPPO had one smart phone model on the top 10 ranking. In 2016, OPPO posted growth of 109 percent in smart phone shipments to become the fourth largest smartphone maker in terms of unit shipment, up from the seventh spot in 2015. Unlike Huawei, OPPO has a smaller product portfolio and operates in fewer markets.    Best Smart Phone 2016    Next  T-Mobile iPhone Edition Red    Previous  Amazon Unlocked Phones    News by brand:IHS Markit    News by category:Mobile phones    News by brand and category:IHS Markit Mobile phones Latest news headlines Virtual Reality Grade Action Camera 64GB Galaxy S8 phone Refurbished Samsung Galaxy Note 7 T-Mobile Premium device protection service Galaxy S8 Over the Horizon 2017 Samsung S8 with DeX Station Samsung Galaxy S8 accessories 128GB iPad tablet from Apple iPad 2017 rugged case Adobe Advertising Cloud platform 32GB iPhone SE preorder sales started T-Mobile iPhone Edition Red Best smart phones in 2016 Amazon Unlocked Phones T-Mobile phone scam protection       5G Accessories Android Galaxy iPhone Camera Mobile phones Rumors Premium Smartphones Smartwatches Tablets TV   CES CeBIT IFA Photokina PMA

Marriott International, the world’s biggest lodging company, is testing devices from the two tech giants at its Aloft hotel in Boston’s Seaport district to determine which is best to let guests turn on lights, close drapes, control room temperature and change television channels via voice command. In December, Wynn Resorts became the first hotel company to install Alexa-powered Echo devices, starting with suites at its flagship Wynn Las Vegas property. Technology companies use hotel rooms as showrooms for new services and devices that can also control smart homes. Amazon and Apple are competing for dominance in the market, which promises to let consumers access and manage household systems such as heating, cooling, lighting and entertainment by speaking a request at home or using a smartphone from afar. Marriott expects to decide whether to adopt the technology for one or more of its chains as early as midyear, potentially boosting sales for the device of choice. More important, it will increase the winning company’s exposure in the market for voice-activated devices, which are gaining more mainstream traction. “Those two players are in the game right now,” said Toni Stoeckl, who oversees the Aloft, Element, AC and Moxy chains as global brand leader for lifestyle brands at Marriott. There are almost 130 Aloft hotels in the U.S., with over 100 more planned. Two decades after Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates installed smart-home software in his compound near Seattle, businesses from home builders and carmakers to hotel operators are adopting such technology for the average consumer. Hotel rooms are an ideal place for Amazon and Apple to showcase their devices and let guests see how they can be used to make their lives more convenient, said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at San Jose research firm Creative Strategies. She likened it to hotel rooms installing iPhone docking stations years ago so people could enjoy their own music. A key question is whether the interaction will be personalized, allowing guests familiar with the devices to log into their own accounts, or instead use a standard set of skills relevant to a hotel stay, like getting news reports, checking weather forecasts or calling for an Uber — commands more appropriate for those unfamiliar with the technology. “It will be interesting to see how much education they have to go through to get guests to use them,” Milanesi said. “This is not mass-market technology.” Crestron Electronics, a closely held residential and commercial automation company that enables technologies such as Alexa to work with various applications, says hotels are a newer market — and one it expects to grow. Lodging currently accounts for 5 to 10 percent of the firm’s annual sales of about $1.5 billion. “You’re starting to see more of this home-automation technology being deployed in these spaces,” said John Clancy, vice president of residential systems at Crestron. “Initially, there was a big fear about whether it works and what the customer expects.” The new Waldorf Astoria luxury hotel in Beverly Hills, operated by Hilton Worldwide Holdings and set to open in June, will have Crestron technology in iPads that let guests control things such as lighting, temperature, TVs, alarm clocks and room service, but the application relies on typing, not voice commands. “We are currently working with various voice assistants and, while we do not have Siri integration at the moment, it is definitely something we continue to explore and consider,” Clancy said. Siri works on Apple mobile devices such as iPhones and iPads. The JW Marriott San Antonio Hill Country Resort & Spa, a Texas property with 1,002 rooms, has installed Alexa devices in 10 of its most popular rooms, with plans to equip an additional 100 rooms next month. The digital assistant can be used to control lights in five of the rooms, but the focus is on using Alexa as a personal concierge for ordering room service, or requesting towels or toothpaste from housekeeping. The resort said it has been testing the Amazon technology since October. Eventually, the digital assistants will be able to perform more concierge-like services and connect with a guest’s personal device to do things such as set an automatic wake-up temperature or have the drapes open at a certain time, Stoeckl said. Wynn Resorts has said it plans to equip all 4,748 rooms at the Las Vegas hotel by this summer. The company is considering installing Echo at other resorts, hotel spokesman Michael Weaver said in an email. The Vegas property is expanding the range of functions controlled by Alexa. It recently gave guests the option to listen to music on most radio stations, and is about to add a station of songs chosen by CEO Steve Wynn personally, Weaver said. Also in the works is an audio guest directory to replace the printed version. For Marriott’s Aloft, a decision between Alexa and Siri could come by summer. “Probably by the end of the first half of this year, we’ll have a pretty good indication of where we’re headed,” Stoeckl said. “The race is still on.” Hui-yong Yu and Spender Soper are Bloomberg writers.

The hackers are threatening to remotely wipe victims' devices if Apple doesn't pay by April 7. Apple responded to the threat by stating that there had not been any breach of its systems, and that if hackers had access to iCloud accounts then they must have gotten them from third party services — people often reuse their same credentials for multiple websites, which is a poor security practice. To prove they’re not joking around the group recently contacted ZDNet with a small sample of 54 account credentials for verification purposes. Some accounts dated back to 2011 and were no longer in use, but of those that could be contacted by ZDNet, 10 people confirmed that the passwords were accurate. Now, this doesn’t prove that the hackers have managed to obtain 300,000 credentials, just that they do have access to some. Moreover, most of the people confirmed that they used their iCloud email address and password on other sites, although three claimed that they weren’t used in any other site. Whether the threat is to be taken seriously or the result of a group of hackers looking for some publicity and the possibility of a quick payout (which we doubt will ever happen), it wouldn’t be a bad idea to change your Apple account password and enable two-factor authentication if you haven’t already done so.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Latest WikiLeaks dump shows CIA targeting Apple earlier than others 24 Mar 2017 2 WikiLeaks Post navigation Previous: Still running Windows Vista? Here’s a wake-up call for you Next: News in brief: Pyongyang role in heist probed; EU to discuss laptops ban; social media rapped on terrorism by Bill Brenner 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit As a reporter covering security a decade ago, most of the focus was on the latest Windows threats. That’s where all the serious attacks were happening. As Apple rolled out each new product, particularly the iPhone in 2007, I waded into the age-old debate over who was more secure: Apple or Microsoft. The experts would tell me much the same thing as they do now: that Macs are targeted less frequently because Windows has the greater market share, not necessarily because it’s more secure. Nevertheless, cases of Apple-oriented malware were few and far between, written about in theoretical terms and not as a clear and present danger until the last couple years. Looking at the latest avalanche of documents stolen from the CIA and made public by WikiLeaks, we now see that the CIA was targeting Apple devices well ahead of everyone else. And those involved were quite nerdy about it, showing off their sci-fi fan credentials by naming projects after such items as the Doctor’s trusty Sonic Screwdriver. The latest leak The latest document dump shows the agency has been creating tools to bypass devices from Apple for at least a decade. This release is called “Dark Matter” and is the second from an archive known as “Vault7” – from which the first leak was posted by WikiLeaks earlier this month. After the first dump was posted, detailing attacks that would require physical access to devices, vendors pointed out that many of the exploits detailed in the documents had since been patched. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More Earlier this week, WikiLeaks offered to work with technology companies including Apple, Google and Microsoft to help them patch the vulnerabilities detailed in the CIA documents in return for a list of demands. Apple responded with this less-than-friendly reply: Night Skies and Sonic Screwdrivers As we delve into the details, let’s begin with the Dark Matter homepage. There, WikiLeaks describes the latest release this way: Today, March 23rd 2017, WikiLeaks releases Vault 7 “Dark Matter,” which contains documentation for several CIA projects that infect Apple Mac firmware (meaning the infection persists even if the operating system is re-installed) developed by the CIA’s Embedded Development Branch (EDB). These documents explain the techniques used by CIA to gain ‘persistence’ on Apple Mac devices, including Macs and iPhones and demonstrate their use of EFI/UEFI and firmware malware. Here’s a breakdown of the tools documented and their purpose: Sonic Screwdriver: Fans of Doctor Who know that the Sonic Screwdriver is the Doctor’s trusty device for analysis and defense. In the CIA’s world, it’s a “mechanism for executing code on peripheral devices while a Mac laptop or desktop is booting,” allowing attackers to “boot its attack software even when a firmware password is enabled”. The CIA’s Sonic Screwdriver infector is stored on the modified firmware of an Apple Thunderbolt-to-Ethernet adapter. The documentation for this was released internally at CIA headquarters November 29 2012. DarkSeaSkies: This is “an implant that persists in the EFI firmware of an Apple MacBook Air computer” and consists of “DarkMatter”, “SeaPea” and “NightSkies”, plus EFI, kernel-space and user-space implants. Internal documents show a January 26 2009 release date. NightSkies: In a December 2008 document describing the NightSkies malware for an iPhone 3G running iOS 2.1, the CIA explains that once exploited, it granted the agency complete control over an infected device. One passage notes: “The tool operates in the background providing upload, download and execution capability on the device. NS is installed via physical access to the device and will wait for user activity before beaconing. When user activity is detected, NS will attempt to beacon to a preconfigured LP [listening post] to retrieve tasking, execute the instructions, and reply with the responses in one session.” SeaPea: This document, last updated in November 2008, shows that while NightSkies ran on Mac OS X 10.5.2 and higher, a rootkit named SeaPea was running on Mac OS X Tiger 10.4, launched 12 years ago. Mac security expert Pedro Vilaca, who specializes in reverse engineering and rootkits, told Forbes that the leaked documents show the CIA as an early adopter of Mac hacking. “They have a good interest in Mac targets, which makes sense since many high-value targets love to use Macs.” Is there a silver lining in these leaks? Since WikiLeaks began leaking stolen documents several years ago, many in the security industry have warned that the releases were a threat to national security. But since the leaks have happened and there’s no turning back, the question is if any good can come of this. It’s a question we asked security experts after the first Vault7 leak a few weeks ago. Eric Cowperthwaite, former VP of strategy for Core Security and now director of managed risk services for Edgile, said at the time that he was conflicted on that question. As an example he brought up the case of Chelsea Manning, a United States Army soldier convicted by court-martial in 2013 for violating the Espionage Act and other offenses, after giving WikiLeaks nearly three-quarters of a million classified and/or sensitive military and diplomatic documents: There is good and bad in this. We know that some of the Manning leaks had impacts on military operations. That was part of Manning’s trial. I also found it interesting that Wikileaks alleges that the US intelligence community has a problem keeping its cyberwar tools off the black market. And if the CIA, NSA, etc. can’t keep these things under control, that is something that citizens should know. That’s why Naked Security will continue to cover the leaks here.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed ‘Turkish’ hackers threaten to reset millions of iCloud accounts 23 Mar 2017 3 Apple, Data loss, Security threats Post navigation Previous: Ex-IT director accused of accessing his former employer for two years Next: News in brief: WikiLeaks drops more CIA documents; ISP privacy rules killed; Instagram launches 2FA by Guy Clapperton 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit A new band of hackers, styling itself the “Turkish Crime Family”, is claiming it has secured the details of some 200m iCloud accounts and that if Apple doesn’t pay a whopping $75,000 bitcoin or ethereum ransom (or $100,000 in iTunes gift cards) it will wipe the lot. There are a few problems to face initially. First, Apple says its systems haven’t been breached. The company told Naked Security: There have not been any breaches in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud and Apple ID. The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services. So 200m accounts obtained from previously compromised third party services is OK? Obviously not, but there’s no suggestion that Apple itself is responsible for any compromised security. The Turkish Crime Family itself appears to be new on the security scene, believed to have started life in Istanbul but now resident in Green Lanes, north London, according to one report. Helpfully, the organisation has a Twitter account. Another curious facet of the alleged breach is that asking for payment in extremely traceable iTunes vouchers seems more than slightly curious; why would you not ask for something with a less clean audit trail? The group itself disputes the amount that’s been reported and blames a media relations operative (presumably the same one who put an email address for media inquiries on the Twitter profile):   This sum of $75,000 is incorrect, this was submitted by one of our old media guys that is not a part of our group. The sum is a lot higher — Turkish Crime Family (@turkcrimefamily) March 23, 2017 The organisation has posted what it claims is video evidence to the Motherboard site. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More David Kennerley, director of threat research at Webroot, is among the first to wonder whether the threat is actually real. There are a lot of questions that need to be answered such as, do these hackers really have access to the data they claim? How did they get hold of such a large amount of data? Was it a vulnerability in Apple’s infrastructure or breach of third-party tool or organisation? Or does the fault lie with good old password re-usage between sites and apps from a consumer side? Wherever the data originates, assuming it’s genuine, Apple faces the decision of whether to pay the ransom or to tough it out. Whichever way it goes, it will want to take precautions to see that this never happens again. Kennerley says: Whether [the breach] proves to be huge news, or no news at all – it’s always good to remind ourselves, no matter the reputation of the organisation that we trust to protect our digital lives we should always take extra measures to protect our own privacy and data. Our advice would be to assume the data has been compromised somehow; if it turns out to be a hoax, the worst thing that can happen is that your data is more secure. Precautions include: If your data is stored anywhere online, assume it could be compromised by a faulty server, deliberate action or the host company going bust. Have a backup – so if your primary host is wiped for any reason you still have your data. Use two factor authentication where possible. Apple encourages it, and here’s an article about the whys and wherefores that we wrote a few months ago. Don’t use the same password everywhere. We can’t say this often enough but people still do it. Pick a strong password – here’s our advice on how to do that Observe the standard security hygiene protocols – don’t click on links from unknown sources, go to the website independently. Finally, there are still people who believe their Apple hardware is completely safe from malware just because it’s Apple. It’s great kit and it works beautifully but nobody is safe – see our article on Apple security.

Reply Adam says: March 24, 2017 at 3:31 pm You know, that’s a good point. Also, they’d have to have some sort of server or admin-level access to be able to wipe or delete accounts, or even a single server’s-worth of accounts. The Turkish Crime Family having that level of access would either entail an incredibly serious, hitherto unknown breach in Apple’s defenses (improbable), or the help of someone on the inside (more likely, but still doubtful). Reply Jeff says: March 24, 2017 at 7:22 pm If an Apple user wasn’t backing up their entire device to the Apple Cloud, a device that was wiped wouldn’t have everything for Apple to restore. I suspect there are quite a few users that don’t do Cloud backups, or only back up a portion of their data. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

The hackers, said to be a London-based group called the "Turkish Crime Family," have threatened to reset passwords and remotely wipe the iPhones of millions of iCloud users if Apple fails to hand over a total of US$700,000. They have given the company an ultimatum to respond by April 7. Apple reportedly has denied that the group succeeded in hacking its systems, maintaining that it obtained the email addresses and passwords from previously compromised third-party services. Apple is working with law enforcement on the threats. The data set in the iCloud hack matches the data found in the 2012 hack of 117 million accounts on LinkedIn, according to some published reports. However, the Turkish Crime Family strongly denied that in a message to TechNewsWorld on Friday. Correcting the Message The initial reports of a ransom demand of just $75,000 were incorrect, the group said in response to our email query. It actually demanded $100,000 for each of its seven members, plus "extra stuff from Apple that are worth more to us than money," which it promised Apple it would keep secret. The group also told TechNewsWorld that the only member based in London is Kerem Albayrek, who is facing charges related to listing a hacked Yahoo database for sale. It claimed that its iCloud ransom demands were in part to spread awareness of Albayrek, as well as of Karim Baratov, a Canadian resident charged earlier this month, along with a second hacker and two Russian FSB agents, in the 2014 breach of 500 million Yahoo account holders. The group told TechNewsWorld that it showed Apple scan logs that contain 800 million iCloud accounts, and that Apple claimed the data had come from outside sources. The group said it planned to launch a website that would list iCloud user names, last names, dates of birth and a captcha of their current location from an iCloud app. The site will not disclose passwords initially, the group said, but it would do so "most probably in the future." Shaking Down Apple The Turkish Crime Family threat should be taken seriously, said Pierluigi Paganini, a cybersecurity analyst and member of the Cyber Group G7 2017 Summit in Italy. "I consider the threat is credible, even if it is quite impossible to know the exact number of iCloud credentials in the hands of hackers," he told TechNewsWorld. The group is known in the hacking underground for the sale of stolen databases, Paganini said. The group reportedly has approached several media outlets directly; it told TechNewsWorld that it had been in contact with five. However, it is unlikely that the group's efforts to stir public pressure against Apple will be effective, noted Mark Nunnikhoven, vice president for cloud research at Trend Micro, in an online post. Apple is too large and has too many resources to give in to public pressure, he pointed out. The group's demands are similar to a shakedown in the physical world, in which criminals demand monthly payments to "protect" a business, Nunnikhoven noted. "In the digital world, the pressures that make victims pay (e.g. keeping your store in one piece) don't apply," Nunnikhoven wrote. "With iCloud accounts, Apple has the ultimate safety valve ... they control the infrastructure behind the accounts," he added. "Which removes most of the pressure points criminals could use." There is no evidence of state involvement in this cyberthreat, Nunnikhoven told TechNewsWorld. However, there is "mounting evidence that this is a group whose eyes are bigger than their stomachs," he suggested. "Selling credentials on the underground is rather commonplace. Attempting to extort one of the biggest companies on the planet with poor quality data is quite another." Credible Threat A report in ZDNet appeared to lend credence to some of the hacking group's claims, however. The group provided 54 credentials to the publication, which were verified as authentic based on a check of the password reset function. Most of the accounts were outdated, but 10 people did confirm to the publication that the obtained passwords were legitimate and that they since had changed them. Those 10 people were living in the UK, and had UK mobile numbers. Trend Micro is urging iCloud users to protect their accounts by using two-factor authentication, and also to use a password manager. A password manager helps users create unique passwords for every account and stores them remotely so that hackers cannot access one or two accounts and thereby gain access to many more. The FBI declined to comment for this story. Apple officials did not respond to our request to comment, and a Yahoo spokesperson was not immediately available.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Set Your Apple TV to Automatically Install Your iPhone’s Apps If there’s an Apple TV compatible version of your favorite iPhone or iPad app, but it never makes it to your Apple TV, that doesn’t do you a lot of good. Fortunately, with a simple tweak, you can ensure you’re getting the best apps on both your phone and your TV. Now that Apple TV and the underlying tvOS have started to mature, there are tons of crossover apps that bring your favorite iOS apps to your TV. In fact, there are so many tvOS apps now, it’s easy to overlook them and not even realize that your favorite time-wasting iPad game or iPhone media app is available on the Apple TV. Thankfully, since the introduction of tvOS 10, you can configure your Apple TV to automatically grab the tvOS versions of iOS apps installed on iPhones and iPads that share the same Apple ID. The feature is off by default, however, so let’s take a moment to flip it on. Open up the Settings app on your Apple TV and select the “Apps” category. Toggle “Automatically Install Apps” on (and, if for some reason “Automatically Update Apps” is off, turn that on also). Now, whenever you install an app on an iOS device that uses the same Apple ID as your Apple TV, if there is a compatible app for tvOS it will be automatically loaded on your Apple TV. While that was simple enough, our work here isn’t quite done. Turning the “Automatically Install Apps” function on doesn’t retroactively apply the feature to iOS apps you’ve already downloaded. So you’ll need to manually add apps to your Apple TV that predate this setting change. Thankfully, it’s super easy to see which apps are missing. Open up the App Store app on your Apple TV and navigate to the “Purchased” tab, as seen below. There you can select “Not on This Apple TV” and see all the apps you’ve purchased on your mobile device that have companion tvOS apps. RELATED ARTICLE How to Rerrange, Configure, and Delete Apps and Games on the New Apple TV Simply select the apps you want on your Apple TV and install them. Don’t worry if you find yourself buried under new apps—it’s very simple to rearrange your apps for a more user-friendly experience and delete apps to free up space From this point forward, the only time you’ll need to manually install apps on your Apple TV is if you are either a) installing a tvOS only application that won’t be automatically installed as a companion app, or b) installing an app purchased by a member of your “Family Sharing” family. If, for example, your daughter bought a TV-worthy game on her iPad, like Transistor or Lumino City, and either of you want to play it on the Apple TV,  you’ll have to manually install it by opening up the App Store app, selecting “Family Sharing” and then selecting the user that purchased the app. There you can browse their purchased apps and download them to your Apple TV just like we browsed the “Not on This Apple TV” category above. Other than the minor hiccup of manually installing old and shared apps, the process is very smooth and all your apps will automatically make the jump from your iPhone to your Apple TV without a hitch.

Apple launch limited-edition smartphones The new crimson dog and bones are being released in partnership with a charity to raise money to combat AIDS By Guy Birchall 24th March 2017, 9:00 pm Updated: 24th March 2017, 9:05 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments APPLE has unveiled the first red version of the iPhone as well as two new iPads. The limited edition iPhone 7 is going on sale from today. 2 Apple are launching a red version of the iPhone 7 in a joint venture with an AIDS charity So why have they launched the scarlet blowers and how can you get your hands on one? The Sun Online explains. Why have they launched a red version? Apple broke with its recent tradition by announcing the new products via its website rather than with a live event and shunning their regular monochrome look for devices. The red version of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is essentially the same as the hardware as announced by the technology giant when first revealing the smartphone back in September. Apple boss Tim Cook said: “Since we began working with (RED) 10 years ago, our customers have made a significant impact in fighting the spread of Aids through the purchase of our products, from the original iPod nano (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition all the way to today’s line-up of Beats products and accessories for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. “The introduction of this special edition iPhone in a gorgeous red finish is our biggest (PRODUCT)RED offering to date in celebration of our partnership with (RED) and we can’t wait to get it into customers’ hands.” PA:Press Association 2 The new devices will be available by the end of this week An Apple spokesman added:”Apple today announced iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus RED Special Edition in a vibrant red aluminium finish, in recognition of more than 10 years of partnership between Apple and (RED). “This gives customers an unprecedented way to contribute to the Global Fund and bring the world a step closer to an AIDS-free generation.” The next version of the iPhone, marking its 10th anniversary this year, is due to be announced in the autumn. How can I get my hands on one? They will be available to pre-order from Friday, with the 7 from £699 with 128GB of memory and the 7 Plus from £819 for the same storage. The two new phones come with the “best battery life ever” in an iPhone and is water and dust resistant. Proceeds will be put toward providing access to life-saving ARV medication in sub-Saharan Africa, through charity RED. In other news the new 9.7in iPad comes with a Retina display screen and replaces the iPad Air 2, first released in 2014, in Apple’s tablet line-up and will start at £339 for the 32GB version of the device. Apple’s Phil Schiller said: “iPad is the world’s most popular tablet. “Customers love the large, 9.7in display for everything from watching TV and movies, to surfing the web, making FaceTime calls and enjoying photos, and now it is even more affordable. “New customers and anyone looking to upgrade will love this new iPad for use at home, in school and for work, with its gorgeous Retina display, our powerful A9 chip and access to the more than 1.3 million apps designed specifically for it.” How much does the new Red iPhone cost? The phones will cost from £699 for the iPhone 7 with 128GB of memory or from £819 for the iPhone 7 plus. Various providers have announced their prices and deals for the phone. Vodafone are offering a 128GB version of the iPhone 8 for £52 per month with an upfront cost of £30, this includes unliminted texts, minutes and 24GB of data. The same version of the bundle in the 256GB phone is available for £57 a month with an upfront cost of £60. Customers looking to buy the iPhone 7 Plus can purchase the 128GB model for £57 a month with an upfront cost of £60 as part of the Vodafone Data Extravaganza. The same bundle for the 256GB version will cost £57 per month with an upfront cost of £100. Carphone Warehouse are also offering trade ins on iPhone 6 models for up to £160 depending on their condition. A number of deals are available for the Red iPhone from Carphone Warehouse including pay monthly and sim free.

The incident took place on March 7 at their home in Kenley, Croydon. According to a report published by The Daily Mail, Roman’s mother collapsed at home after which, he unlocked his mother’s iPhone using her thumb and with the help of Siri called the 999 emergency services. During the call, the boy told the operator that he thought his mother had died because “she was closing her eyes and not breathing.” The operator guided Roman, asking him to shake his mother. In the meantime, the research team located Roman’s address on the basis of the conversation. Thirteen minutes later, officers arrived at Roman’s home. They discovered Roman’s mother lying unconscious on the floor and the paramedics were successfully able to bring her back to consciousness. After which, she was taken to the hospital. "Hearing this call brings home the importance of teaching your young child their home address and how to call police or emergency services in an emergency situation," Met Police Chief Superintendent Ade Adelekan said. "If you do nothing else today, then I'd implore any parents of young children to sit down with them and make sure they know what to do in this kind of situation and that they know how to contact police or other emergency services in an emergency. As this case demonstrates so poignantly, it could really be the difference between life and death."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 March 2017 by Military News How Equally-Weighted Funds Work Equally weighted funds attract investors’ attention because a number of them are well-known as market beaters. Over the last 10 years, the returns of funds like Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF  have beaten the standard S&P 500 index fund by about 0.50% per year, despite having higher fees than ordinary index funds. But the reason for their out-performance may not be as complex as you might think. In fact, much of it can be attributed to the funds’ higher-than-average risks. In this segment of Industry Focus: Financials , The Motley Fool’s Gaby Lapera and Jordan Wathen discuss the differences between equally weighted funds and classic market-cap weighted funds. A full transcript follows the video. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Apple wasn’t one of them! That’s right — they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. Click here to learn about these picks! *Stock Advisor returns as of February 6, 2017 This podcast was recorded on March 20, 2017. Gaby Lapera: Our first question comes from Rob. He writes, „Recently, I have been reading about equal weight index funds as compared to the standard capital weighted funds.” Example: RSP (NYSEMKT: RSP) vs. SPY (NYSEMKT: SPY) . „Can you explore these equal-weight funds in depth, please?” So, why don’t we start with explaining what the difference is between those two types of funds. Jordan Wathen: I think the big difference is that — there’s really two differences, but one of the big ones is the standard is market cap weighted, as he alluded to, which means that the largest companies make up the largest part of the index. So, for something like the S&P 500, the largest holdings, in order, are Apple , Microsoft , and Johnson & Johnson . Three out of 500 companies, those three, make about 8% of the S&P 500. Lapera: That’s incredible. Wathen: If you look at an equally weighted index, it means that all of those are treated equally. So, those three, instead of making up 8% of the index, would make up 0.6% of the index. Lapera: That makes sense. That would mean that in equal weighted funds, smaller cap companies make up a larger percentage of the companies represented. Wathen: Right. If you look at it, you would say the big difference between them is that the market cap weighted funds, the standard funds, are biased toward the largest stocks, whereas equally weighted funds are more biased toward the smaller stocks. In a traditional S&P 500 funds, the standard fund, it invests about 45% of its assets in giant companies, or, super-large-cap companies. An equally weighted fund would only have about 12% of its assets in those companies. So, you can see, an equally weighted fund is way less reliant on the big 10 or 20 companies that make up the index. Lapera: Yeah, and I’m sure there’s pros and cons to each. Wathen: A standard S&P fund, the second big difference between these two is the industry difference. As I said before, the two largest components of the S&P 500 are Apple and Microsoft, two huge tech giants. If you look at an equally weighted index, tech only makes up about 12% of assets. But in a standard S&P 500, it makes up about 18% of assets. So, there’s a size difference, and there’s also the industry difference between the two funds. Lapera: Yeah. So, maybe if you’re looking to be really heavily invested in tech and big companies, the standard market cap weighted one might be for you. But if you’re looking to be a little bit more diverse in your interests, maybe be equally weighted one is for you. Wathen: Right. I think what gets people interested in this is that over long spans of periods of time, the equally weighted one will probably outperform because it has exposure to small and mid-cap companies, which typically outperform larger caps. But, obviously, that outperformance comes with more volatility. You’re going to have to deal with greater losses in a year where the S&P 500 is down. Lapera: Yeah. And the reason that the small and mid-caps tend to outperform the large caps over the long term is because the small and mid-caps have room to grow, whereas the super-long mega-giant-caps that make up a lot of the market cap weighted ones don’t have as much space to grow, so it’s getting harder and harder for them to outperform their performance from last year. Wathen: Just look at Apple, for example. If you look at Apple, by assets, a lot of it is just cash. And obviously, cash isn’t going to beat stocks in the long haul. So, intuitively, it makes sense that a lot of these largest companies that derive a lot of their value from earnings years ago aren’t going to outperform the companies that will outperform on the basis of earnings going forward.

After a couple of minor iterations, I'm convinced it's a worthy alternative for those sick of the bloat of other notes apps and for those who like the take-home simplicity of plain text. Provided you're in the Apple ecosystem, anyway. Bear Is An iPhone And Mac Notes App Simple Enough For To-Dos But Powerful Enough For Longer Writing iOS/Mac. There's certainly no shortage of notes app out there, but Bear's an app that manages to toe the line between a few different popular styles, and might suit you if you need more features than plain text offers, but not as much as something like Evernote. Read more Bear is a notes app for Mac, iPhone and iPad that also happened to win Apple's Best Of awards last year. The lack of a Windows, Android or web client is a bummer in this day and age, but if you're in the Apple ecosystem this shouldn't matter much. Bear sits between plain text and Evernote, between minimalism and bloat. It targets a very specific subset of people, who I'll call Plain Text, Organised. I've long been an advocate of plain text, but there's no denying that it's hard to keep organised or use for complex research. In Bear's case, it utilises Markdown so you can format text easily while still maintaining plain text portability. Bear has recently become my notes app of choice to accompany my favourite long-form writing software, Ulysses. Bear also has an interesting pricing scheme that's worth talking about up front. It's free if you don't need to sync between devices or use custom themes. If you want that syncing, Bear costs $21.49/year. While that's a turnoff for people who are used to getting software for free, it does mean that Bear has a sustainable business model. This hopefully means Bear will exist and be in development for years to come. You can try Bear out without syncing for free, or get a free month trial of the premium subscription if you're still not sure about it. With that, let's take a look at how Bear holds up, what makes it different, and how I've been using it. I Still Use Plain Text For Everything, And I Love It Plain text has long been a favourite here at Lifehacker, but over the years most people have moved away from it in favour of specialised to-do apps, notes apps, writing apps or whatever else. I still use plain text for just about everything, but never thought much about why I do. The more I thought about it, the more I realised that snazzy features aside, plain text is still king for portability and simplicity. Read more Bear Organises with Hashtags, Not Notebooks Bear does not use a notebook or folder system to organise notes. Instead, it just uses hashtags. This is great for me because hashtags have long worked better for my workflow. Instead of creating a notebook, then creating notes inside of that, hashtags are a more flexible — a note can exist in two places at once. Just type a # followed by whatever tag you want, like #potentialcaves, and that's automatically parsed in Bear's sidebar as a tag. You can give a note an unlimited number of tags, which is great when you want to a note to appear in multiple places at once. Even better, you can nest tags using a forward slash. This creates a more traditional looking folder structure. For example, you can do a tag like, #book/research, #book/notes, #book/interviews to create a book tag with three subdirectories — research, notes and interviews. Of course, many other notes apps use this system too, including Evernote and OneNote, so this isn't some crazy new feature. But this is Bear's only method for organisation, so it's good to learn how to use it and pick an organisation method that works for you. I've Been Using Tags All Wrong Pretty much every notes, journal, to-do app and writing app has a tagging system now. With it, you're supposed to be able to easily organise everything so you can find it instantly, but tags are a bit of an ambiguous idea that are hard to really use well. I did it wrong for years, but I've finally come up with a system I like. Read more Bear's Note Linking Is A Feature I Never Realised I Wanted Until I Used It Bear has a system built into it where you can link notes together. When you do this, you can navigate between notes really easily. For me, it's essentially a system where I can create my own little Wikipedia. For example, if I have notes on a subject or a person, I can right-click a note to copy a link to it, then paste that in a new note to create a link. Now, I can simply click on the link in the new note to go back to the original at any point. You can do this for as many notes as you want, creating a massive web of linked notes. It's sort of like making a little interconnected website that only you can navigate. I didn't really understand why I'd use this until I started playing around with it. Now that I have, I've found that I use it most for notes about certain contacts or names I might not remember at first, for various code snippets that rely on other scripts, or for slightly complex sets of notes like travel documents where I don't want everything dumped into a single note. There are likely a lot more ways to use this I haven't thought of yet. The one problem with this is that Bear lacks a back button, so getting back to your original note take more clicks than it feels like it should, but you get used to it after a little while. Bear Has a Few Clever Formatting Tricks Since Bear works on a slightly different version of Markdown, it has all those formatting tricks built into it, including the ability to make lists with check boxes and add in quotes, and it supports a variety of heading sizes. Bear has a few of its own little special tricks too. My favourite of those little tricks is support for code snippets. So if you're a coder, you can drop in a code snippet and it's formatted properly with optional syntax highlighting. Just right-click, then select Paste From > Code. This is super useful for people like me who spend most of their time breaking code and then testing out dozens of idiot solutions. Bear can also recognise certain types of data and format them automatically. It recognises addresses and turns them into links, it recognises links and email addresses and makes them clickable, and has inline support for images. There's a Web Clipper, If That's Your Thing If you use the web clipper to save articles or portions of web pages in OneNote or Evernote, you'll be happy to know that Bear has that capability as well. Just download the browser extension for your web browser and you're all set. This works pretty much as you'd expect. Click the Bear extension to import an entire page into a new note, or highlight a block of text, then click the Bear extension to import a specific selection. It's nowhere near as robust as Evernote's web clipper, but it does the job. Bear Just Looks Really Good Look, I know this doesn't matter from a usability point of view, but Bear looks really nice. It's simple, has a few colour theme options to choose from, and just generally goes for a minimal approach. I've always hated Evernote's awful green and OneNote's garish purple, and while some oddball colour choices certainly aren't enough to keep me away from a good app, it's nice that Bear bucks this trend and looks good. Obviously, this doesn't matter to everyone, nor should it, but it's still nice. What Bear Still Needs Bear isn't perfect, and it's missing some features people find essential. The most glaring problem is that it's Apple-only. A web app is supposedly in the works, but until then Bear's usefulness will be cut short. Bear also doesn't have collaboration or publishing features, which could be a turn off for some. I personally never use either of those features in other notes apps so it doesn't bother me, but it certainly prevents Bear from being an option in the workplace for a lot of people. It's also lacking password protection. Again, this is a feature I'd never use, but it's something to consider if you lock your notes away behind a password. Bear is also missing the more techy features of Evernote and OneNote like document scanning, voice recording, reminders and dictation, though based on the general functionality of Bear, I'd argue that most of those don't really belong here. If you're even remotely interested in Bear at this point, I recommend just giving it a spin. Bear supports a ton of import options, including Apple Notes, DayOne, Evernote, Ulysses and Vesper, so it's easy to take it for a test drive without starting over from scratch. If you end up wanting to leave Bear at any point, they make it easy. You can export your notes to just about every format you could possibly need, included TXT, RTF, HTML and DOCX amongst others. It's a strong alternative when you can't bear the bloat of other apps. WATCH MORE: Tech News & Life Hacks Comments mzantsi @mzantsi Mar 25, 2017, 2:48pm I'm on Android, but I'm looking for a plain text alternative to Evernote. While it is a wonderful catch-all database, it creates an appalling mess of different text formatting. Evernote have also shown no interest in fixing a problem with double spacing despite years of complaints. For the moment, I am shifting over to Workflowy, but this doesn't have features like reminders. There's space for someone who can provide the golden mean. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

Today, the company’s special red iPhone 7 and 7 Plus goes on sale, with a hefty $919 (£919) price tag for the most expensive model. The phone was prominently marketed to consumers as “an unprecedented way to contribute to the Global Fund and bring the world a step closer to an AIDS-free generation”. But despite the claim appearing in promotional material, the company is refusing to explain how much of the profit will actually go to charity, following multiple requests from PinkNews. The small print on Apple’s website specifies that only an unspecified “contribution” will go to charity from each purchase, despite Apple’s high profit margins on the lucratively popular device. The phone was launched as part of a partnership with (RED), a non-profit entity which specialises in AIDS-themed brand deals with corporations. (RED) does not carry out any primary HIV/AIDS work itself – instead contributing to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS. PinkNews has repeatedly asked both Apple and (RED) to clarify how much Apple’s charitable contribution will be from the sale of each phone, and how much will go to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS. A spokesperson for Apple declined to comment, pointing a release that explains the company has “raised $130 million” across the entirety of its ten-year partnership with (RED). Though the number may seem high, it works out at 0.01% of the company’s estimated $1.25 trillion net revenue over the same period, which netted the company $274 billion profit. As part of its (RED) partnership, Apple has launched a string of similar products in the past – including special edition iPods, speakers and even Apple Watches that touted their link to fighting AIDS. The iPhone, however is its most expensive to date. (RED) did not respond to any of our multiple requests for comment – though curiously one of our emails sent to (RED) appears to have been opened in Cupertino, California, where Apple’s headquarters is located. Despite the lack of reply, the PinkNews email was opened over a hundred times. In a release, Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, said: “Since we began working with (RED) 10 years ago, our customers have made a significant impact in fighting the spread of AIDS through the purchase of our products. “The introduction of this special edition iPhone in a gorgeous red finish is our biggest (PRODUCT)RED offering to date in celebration of our partnership with (RED), and we can’t wait to get it into customers’ hands.” Deborah Dugan, (RED)’s CEO, said: “Apple is the world’s largest corporate donor to the Global Fund, contributing more than $130 million as part of its partnership with (RED). “Combining the global reach of the world’s most loved smartphone with our efforts to provide access to life-saving ARV medication in sub-Saharan Africa, customers now have a remarkable opportunity to make a difference and contribute to the Global Fund through the purchase of this new beautiful (PRODUCT)RED iPhone.” 22 reader comments Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Previous story Court upholds gay widower's right to be named on husband's death certificate Next story Taiwan's top court is hearing a case that could make marriage equality legal More like this AIDS charity exposes huge government cuts to HIV support Apple is ‘hiding’ AIDS charity tie-up from users in China Apple launches iPhone ‘to fight AIDS’ – but won’t say how much money is going to charity Democrats to re-introduce LGBT Equality Act in Congress Dozens of big businesses back trans student in Supreme Court bathroom case Apple takes stand against Trump on transgender rights Watch Apple boss Tim Cook show off his singing skills in James Corden’s latest Carpool Karaoke Barbra Streisand called Apple CEO Tim Cook to complain Siri says her name wrong More: HIV AIDS Apple iPhone phone Red Red iPhone Trending Trending Now Orange is the New Black stars tie the knot in beautiful intimate ceremony Russian government warns citizens not to be homophobic while on holiday in Europe Graham Norton receives backlash for pressuring Cara Delevingne into talking about her sex life on live TV This trans guy wants you to know his powerful before and after story Trending Orange is the New Black stars tie the knot in beautiful intimate ceremony Russian government warns citizens not to be homophobic while on holiday in Europe Graham Norton receives backlash for pressuring Cara Delevingne into talking about her sex life on live TV This trans guy wants you to know his powerful before and after story Latest stories Merkel’s rivals to publish draft same-sex marriage bill ahead of key German election Lesbians and bisexual teens more likely to smoke than straight peers, study finds Beauty and the Beast and Power Rangers are “a lifeline” for LGBT youth, says GLAAD head Lawsuit accuses port authority of unlawful arrests of gay men Rachel Dolezal, who claims she is black, under fire for comparing herself to transgender people This man was so desperate to appear Ellen he hired a fake set and a fake Ellen © 2017 PinkNews Terms Contact Advertise

While major updates for the service might not be expected until iOS 11 with a likely unveiling at Apple’s WWDC event in June, Apple has a few things planned before that and we have some hints about what to expect in the future. Apple’s first original content starting with TV shows will launch on Apple Music next month, an expansion for Beats 1 is in the works, and tweaks to the Apple Music app to better highlight video content are incoming. Head below for our look at what’s next for Apple Music and Beats 1: The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac Original Content Apple has already given us a taste of what’s to come for Apple Music with a sneak peek at original content it has planned for the service. It has yet to make the deals it needs to launch a video streaming service, and that means for now its original content strategy is focusing on Apple Music. It will all start next month when its first original content debuts for Apple Music subscribers. Apple already announced and released trailers for its first two original TV show series, Carpool Karaoke and Planet of the Apps, and they give us some clues at what’s coming… During an interview last month unveiling details about the new Planet of the Apps show, the producer talked about plans for a standalone app of sorts for the show that would allow for interactive content for fans to go beyond the weekly linear episodes (in the video below). “what it’s also going to be is an app…how do you take all of this incredible content and this deep educational immersive experience we have within the show and go into different elements of it for longer and have parts of the show be controlled by the consumer watching it not just in its linear representation.” Apple’s Eddy Cue added to that comment, hinting that “there’s a lot of things that we shoot that don’t end up on air in a linear format, and if you want to go deeper on developer… particular thing that’s happening, we can do that.” That means that Apple Music’s original content could also live in apps outside of Apple Music, and possibly have features beyond just watching the show whether in the Apple Music app or elsewhere. Full details were clearly being kept for an official launch, but it sounds like Apple has more up its sleeve than just delivering a weekly episode in video format. As for the direction of Apple’s original content itself, it’s a bit unclear with these first two shows. The tie-in with Apple Music for Carpool Karaoke is obvious: popular musicians performing karaoke during what is otherwise essentially an interview inside a moving vehicle. The connection with Planet of the Apps— a reality contest show where app developers compete for funding and App Store placement— is less obvious. But what is clear is that Apple Music original content won’t be limited to shows actually about or related to music. In other words, Apple Music is about to be a whole lot more than just music, for better or for worse depending on your view-point on the subject. Carpool Karaoke will launch first next month and Planet of the Apps sometime this spring. And the original content certainly won’t stop there. A report back in January before Apple’s unveiling of the new TV series noted that the company was interested in both scripted tv shows and possibly original movies. Dr. Dre is also said to be developing an original series for Apple Music. App redesign w/ TV & Movies section One thing we do know is Apple will have a new “TV & Movies” section built into the Apple Music app, likely next month when the new shows start to launch, at least on iOS. This was leaked in the second clip for the Carpool Karaoke series last month (pictured above). So far the Apple Music app just has a neglected Videos section buried within the Browse tab, so this change gives hope that Apple is possibly revamping the presence of video in the app alongside the new shows. Add in the app plans the company hinted at for Planet of the Apps and it sounds like we have some new app features and possibly a redesign incoming. More Beats, Live events Beats 1 has spent the last year debuting a lot of new content from high-profile artists, and while Apple hasn’t released specifics on how many of its 20 million subscribers are actually listening to the 24/7 radio station, it looks like Beats is here to stay as the face of live music content within Apple Music. And there’s more on the way… Right now we have the 24/7 Beats 1 radio stream with a growing list of celebrity guest shows and live content. What’s next for Beats 1? Well probably Beats 2, 3, 4, and so on. That, according Apple Music’s creative director Zane Lowe, is an idea the team is developing. Beats 1 set up shop this year at SXSW and did live broadcasts with interviews and performances, but how many Apple Music subscribers got to see the shows? Only a lucky few (mostly journalists) in attendance. The live concerts it held with The Chainsmokers, Vince Staples and others were nowhere to be found in Apple Music, and that’s a shame. Beats 1 has a ton of great content every week but it’s buried in the app and mostly only promoted on social channels. It’s now in a good groove having developed the format, but now Beats 1 needs a revamp and Apple needs a way to better promote live content within the app. Fortunately it looks like that’s in the plans thanks to Apple’s other original content plans and the new TV shows & Movies section. Apple’s next major event for Apple Music could be the Apple Music Festival, last held in London in September and available to live stream free for all subscribers. Exclusive content Apple has made it clear that part of its strategy with Apple Music is to assist artists in creating great content. Sometimes that means it’s had a hand in producing content in one way or another, and that content usually ends up benefiting Apple by becoming an exclusive release on Apple Music for a period of time. Apple reportedly gave Chance the Rapper $500,000 for exclusive rights to his latest release for two weeks. Drake’s latest project broke the Apple Music record w/ 89.9M streams in 24 hours, besting Spotify by 30M. So you can expect the war for exclusives between the streaming music services to continue, and Apple to get even more aggressive as it ties-in its efforts with original content. WWDC 2017 After the updates next month with the new original content and accompanying app updates, we will have our eyes on WWDC in June. It will be where Apple gives us our first glimpse at what’s to come in iOS 11, and that will also certainly mean some improvements for Apple Music in the process. It will also be primetime for updates to Apple TV and other platforms, so if Apple has plans for revamped apps and perhaps bringing the new Apple Music original content to its TV app (as it inevitably expands it to more countries outside the US), that will be the time to do it. It would also be an ideal venue to make a splash with Planet of the Apps, and if the show debuts in the spring as a linear episodic series as planned, it should still be running and in full swing during WWDC.

Liam Wright was just 18 when he lost his battle against a rare bone cancer in December last year. Members of his devastated family in Brotton were aware his Apple iPad contained details of Liam’s wishes regarding his funeral. However as they were unable to unlock the device after a software update, and claim Apple would not assist, they had to go ahead with the service regardless. Three months on and the family are continuing the fight to access the iPad for their treasured photos and videos of Liam but have so far “hit a brick wall” with Apple. Liam’s mum bought the iPad for her son several years ago and it was registered under his name. Liam Wright (Photo: Collect Unknown) “When he got a phone, he continued to use the iPad but also allowed the rest of his family and younger relatives to use it as well,” said his sister Kerry Lamb. “It has lots of photos and videos on it. “It went into activation lock on December 5. By that point, Liam was too poorly to speak to tell us the code so we contacted Apple. “We knew he had made quite a few notes about his funeral on the iPad. Liam with his sister Kirsty (Photo: Collect Unknown) “He hadn’t want to speak about it - we knew he was dying and he knew he was dying - but it was not a conversation he wanted to have. “He was the only one who knew the code so we needed Apple to unlock it.” But Apple did not help, she said. Liam lost his battle on December 7 surrounded by his close family, leaving behind his mum Jane, sisters, Kerry, and Kirsty, and nieces and nephews, Sean, Tyler and Aisha.

I know they have data protection rules but we were even able to close his bank account with the death certificate. “We’ve been passed from pillar to post. It seems you get different answers depending on who you speak to. Liam Wright with his family (Photo: Collect Unknown) “Mum spoke to them and said ‘You can’t do this it’s wrong. How would you feel if it was photos of your son?’ “She’s not too bad at the moment but it gets her very upset when she sees other people’s photos of Liam and she can’t even access her own.” Liam discovered he had osteosarcoma after sustaining a football injury. It appeared the former Freebrough Academy pupil was getting better, but early last year he received the devastating news that the cancer was terminal. He did not tell his closest friends he had weeks to live because he didn’t want them to worry. The aspiring personal trainer, hoped to work with children who “didn’t fit the sporting category”. Kerry said: “He hoped to work with children who were overweight, and he wanted to give them a bit of confidence. “He was a gentle giant. He loved everyone and everyone loved him.” The Gazette contacted Apple in relation to the family’s complaint but have not received a response.

It ranks Google (GOOG, GOOGL) above Apple (AAPL), puts AT&T (T) atop telecommunications firms and even says some modestly nice things about firms in China and Russia. But before you rush to the comments to denounce the 2017 Ranking Digital Rights Corporate Accountability Index, realize this report grades transparency, not just conduct — and that it’s not too complimentary about the effort any of the 22 firms surveyed put into defending your freedom of speech and privacy. “We have two companies that got a D and everybody else got an F,” said Ranking Digital Rights director Rebecca MacKinnon at a Thursday-morning event in Washington introducing the Washington-based non-profit’s report. Microsoft, Google and everybody else Those two corporations are Google and Microsoft (MSFT), which earned passing averages — 65 and 62 out of 100, respectively — across the report’s three categories: governance, freedom of expression and privacy. The first judges a company’s institutional commitment to protecting human rights, as seen in things like having senior-level oversight, assessing the risks to them posed by products and providing customers with responsive complaint mechanisms. The second rates such free-speech defenses as clear terms of service, a documented process for dealing with requests to remove customers’ content, transparency about content removal and policies that don’t require you to use your real name. The third covers customers’ control of their data, transparency about both corporate usage of that data and outside demands for it, responses to security vulnerabilities and data breaches and encryption of your data to protect it from snooping. Both Google and Microsoft ingest massive amounts of customer information, but both also document what they collect, how they use it, under what conditions a government can get it and how often that happens. After those two, Yahoo (YHOO), Yahoo Finance’s parent company, and Facebook (FB) earned scores of 58 and 53, respectively. Everybody else fell below 50. AT&T and Twitter (TWTR) each got a 48, while Apple got a score of 35. Samsung earned a dismal 26. Opacity will hold a company back Apple, a company that takes great pride in comparing its treatment of its customers’ data with Google’s, did badly because of one word: opacity. Ranking Digital Rights (funded by the MacArthur, Ford, Open Society and Mozilla foundations, plus the State Department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor) criticized Apple’s failure to document its policies about freedom of expression. When you look at the company’s often-inscrutable control of the iOS App Store and its history of rejecting apps because of their content, that’s a fair critique. As MacKinnon observed Thursday, “There’s no transparency about how it polices its App Store.” The report also found fault with the Cupertino, Calif.-based company’s lack of disclosure about its data-usage and security policies and procedures — even while noting the “consensus in the technical community that its products are among the most secure on the market.” Added MacKinnon, “It’s not clear why they don’t disclose more.” Samsung got punished for being even less open about its policies, including a failure to post a “transparency report,” which serves as a regular account of government demands for user data that has become common at most large U.S. tech firms. USA! USA! The most striking part of this report may be how badly tech and telecom companies outside of the U.S. performed. The Korean mobile-internet firm Kakao earned a 50 for its clear data-use policies, the British telecom firm Vodafone got a 48 largely on the strength of its governance score—and nobody else did better than 33. That includes such European firms as France’s Orange (32) and Spain’s Telefónica (33) that operate under much stricter privacy laws than their U.S. counterparts. Once again, a lack of transparency held them back. “Even if they’re complying with European data protection regulations, they’re not telling their users very much,” MacKinnon said. The report covers internet companies operating in China (Baidu and Tencent, 13 and 22) and Russia (Yandex and Mail.ru, 28 and 22), but the worst scores fell to two state-owned telecom firms in the Middle East. The United Arab Emirates’ Etisalat, got an 8 and Qatar’s Ooredoo notched a 5 for disclosing next to nothing about their policies protecting customers’ rights. Read More Now what? Will this report get those laggards to do better? Maybe not. But there’s room to hope that non-cellar-dwelling companies will strive to do better. “In response to our evaluation in 2015 several companies improved their transparency reporting,” MacKinnon wrote in an e-mail. She added that while no companies in 2015’s survey disclosed data about content removed on terms-of-service grounds, three now do. “Based on conversations with companies we have reason to believe that our ranking was among several prompts for them to do this,” she said. And at Thursday’s event, she noted that Twitter’s latest transparency report now features information about “TOS” removals. This kind of public shaming and scolding may not be much, but given the Trump administration’s campaign to curb government regulations, it may also be all we have in the United States.

A London-based group of hackers calling themselves the “Turkish Crime Family” claimed earlier this week to have gained access to millions of iCloud accounts, threatening to remotely wipe victims’ devices unless Apple paid a large ransom. While Apple later indicated that there had been no breach of its systems, analysts have suggested that the hacker group likely has data acquired from one or more breaches that occurred years ago at sites such as LinkedIn. Due to the obvious naming of iCloud accounts and the number of users who may reuse passwords, a dump of passwords stolen from another site could easily be exploited to hack at least some iCloud accounts. ZDNet was able to obtain a sample set of 54 credentials from the hacker group, which they then tested for verification purposes, finding all 54 accounts to be currently valid based on Apple’s password reset function. The data set included “icloud.com” accounts dating back to 2011, as well as legacy “me.com” and “mac.com” accounts going back as far as 2000. The list that ZDNet obtained included only email addresses and plain-text passwords, suggesting that it could have been aggregated from multiple sources. ZDNet reached out to contact each person on the list to ask them to confirm their passwords, noting in the process that most of the accounts were no longer registered with iMessage (if they ever had been), and therefore couldn’t be immediately reached. According to the report, 10 people confirmed that their passwords were accurate (and have since changed them); they also confirmed that they had used the same password since they opened their iCloud accounts, although one specifically mentioned that the password he confirmed had not been used in at least two years, narrowing down the possible date of the breaches to somewhere between 2011 and 2015. Three people who responded to ZDNet’s inquiries claimed their passwords were unique to iCloud and were not used on any other site. Notably, all of these people were based in the U.K., and the hackers refused to hand over a U.S.-based sample of accounts. Comments It's pretty clear there has been no new breach.

The documents released by the antisecrecy site Thursday pointed to an apparent CIA program to hack Apple devices using techniques that users couldn’t disable by resetting their devices. The iPhone hack was limited to the 3G model from 2008. Late Thursday, Apple said the flaw was fixed with the release of the iPhone 3GS a year later. Apple also said the Mac vulnerabilities were all fixed in Macs that were released after 2013. Apple’s statement was consistent with assessments from security experts, who say that many of the apparent vulnerabilities were in older technology. Apple is going further in saying those flaws have all been fixed, based on its preliminary analysis. Security experts say the exploits described in the WikiLeaks documents are plausible, but suggest they pose little threat to typical users. Besides being likely out of date, the techniques also typically require physical access to devices, something the CIA would use only for targeted individuals, not a broader population. The CIA has not commented on the authenticity of this and earlier WikiLeaks revelations, but has previously said it complies with a legal prohibition against electronic surveillance “targeting individuals here at home, including our fellow Americans.” The leaks Thursday came about two weeks after WikiLeaks published thousands of alleged CIA documents describing hacking tools it said the government employed to break into computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs from companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. WikiLeaks has offered to share further details with tech companies to help them fix flaws, though accepting such information might subject companies to certain conditions and put government contracts at risk. Apple addressed the offer for the first time Thursday. “We have not negotiated with WikiLeaks for any information,” its statement read. “We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn’t in the public domain.” Apple said that while it takes users’ security and privacy seriously, “we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users.” Earlier, Microsoft said WikiLeaks had made initial contact through its public reporting channel, “and we have followed up, treating them as we would any other finder.” Mozilla, the organization behind the Firefox Web browser, also said it had been contacted through the email address it uses for security vulnerability reporting. Mozilla said it would take steps necessary to fix any vulnerabilities reported that way. Anick Jesdanun is an Associated Press writer.

Following a string of incidents in 2010, from mass suicides caused by overwork to the secret dumping of heavy metals into rivers, five environmental groups came together to press the Cupertino company to overhaul its supply chain. But Apple remained evasive and refused to work with activists who had uncovered some of the violations, said the non-governmental organisations, which accused the iPhone maker of hiding behind the secrecy and complexity of its supply chain to shirk its environmental and social responsibilities. To spotlight the damage being caused by Apple's suppliers, the five NGOs held a media event in 2011 titled "Detoxify the Apple to save Snow White", with a logo of the Disney princess holding a black apple. "When news broke that 130 workers fell ill because of chemicals used to clean iPad screens, we then made a short video of the seven dwarves crying by Snow White's grave," recalled Madam Li Li, founder of Beijing-based Enviro- friends, at a forum on Wednesday. SENDING A CLEAR MESSAGE This is hard work, but our message is becoming clear across our supply chain that this is how we expect our suppliers to do business. MS PAULA PYERS, Apple's senior director in charge of supply-chain social responsibility, on addressing environmental issues with its suppliers. The groups' persistence paid off in 2012, when Apple agreed to work with the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE), another of the five NGOs, to address environmental issues with its suppliers. Within a year, Apple agreed to have some of its suppliers audited under the supervision of selected NGOs, with the findings and rectification actions published by the environmental groups. The result? Factories making printed circuit boards for Apple are now more closely monitored to meet waste water discharge standards. Hazardous waste from manufacturing has been reduced, and so has water use. Today, Apple tops some 200 firms in a transparency index compiled by the NGOs, a far cry from the early days when it was ranked last among 29 IT firms. "This is hard work, but our message is becoming clear across our supply chain that this is how we expect our suppliers to do business," said Apple's senior director in charge of supply-chain social responsibility, Ms Paula Pyers, who was on a panel discussion at the forum with Madam Li. The green groups' success in influencing Apple points to the growing role of NGOs in China, where the government has traditionally been suspicious of civil society activism. Unlike elsewhere, NGOs here have to be registered with the state and affiliated with a government agency. But greater public sensitivity towards environmental degradation and a greener supply chain has given green NGOs the space to flourish, said Columbia University researcher Ruge Gao. Brands are also seeing more reasons to work with activists to ensure that the making of their goods meets international standards. Coca-Cola, for instance, has a localisation strategy, so it is interested in ensuring that farmers meet quality controls. Otherwise, raw materials have to be imported, said its sustainability director of public affairs and communications for Greater China, Ms Tian Wenhong. For Huawei, complying with global standards, such as for its phones to be lead-free, was key to building brand reputation as it strove to internationalise, said its storage marketing director Patrick Li. Apple, too, has seen greater consumer interest in products that are not just high-quality, but also environmentally friendly, said Ms Pyers. Some sectors are even volunteering to have their suppliers meet higher environmental standards. At the forum on Wednesday, a group of Chinese property developers, which together account for more than 1.3 trillion yuan (S$264 billion) of sales revenue - 15 per cent of the real estate market - launched a green index to manage their cement and steel suppliers. It marks the first time an industry in China has worked together to improve supply chain environmental management, said the IPE, and the United Nations Environment Programme has called the undertaking a "global first".

Apple says the purported hacking techniques have all been fixed in recent iPhones and Mac computers. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, File) NEW YORK (AP) — Apple said purported hacking vulnerabilities disclosed by WikiLeaks this week have all been fixed in recent iPhones and Mac computers. The documents released by the anti-secrecy site Thursday morning pointed to an apparent CIA program to hack Apple devices using techniques that users couldn't disable by resetting their devices. The iPhone hack was limited to the 3G model from 2008. In a statement late Thursday, Apple said the flaw was fixed with the release of the iPhone 3GS a year later. Apple also said the Mac vulnerabilities were all fixed in all Macs launched after 2013. Apple's statement was consistent with assessments from security experts, who say that many of the apparent vulnerabilities were in older technology. Apple is going further in saying those flaws have all been fixed, based on its preliminary analysis. Security experts say the exploits described in the WikiLeaks documents are plausible, but suggest they pose little threat to typical users. Besides being likely out of date, the techniques also typically require physical access to devices, something the CIA would use only for targeted individuals, not a broader population. The CIA has not commented on the authenticity of this and earlier WikiLeaks revelations, but has previously said it complies with a legal prohibition against electronic surveillance "targeting individuals here at home, including our fellow Americans." The leaks Thursday came about two weeks after WikiLeaks published thousands of alleged CIA documents describing hacking tools it said the government employed to break into computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs from companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. WikiLeaks has offered to share further details with tech companies to help them fix flaws, though accepting such information might subject companies to certain conditions and put government contracts at risk. Apple addressed the offer for the first time in Thursday's statement. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

"We have not negotiated with WikiLeaks for any information," the statement read. "We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn't in the public domain." Apple said that while it takes users' security and privacy seriously, "we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users." Earlier, Microsoft said WikiLeaks had made initial contact through its public reporting channel, "and we have followed up, treating them as we would any other finder." Mozilla, the organization behind the Firefox web browser, also said it had been contacted through the email address it uses for security vulnerability reporting. Mozilla said it would take steps necessary to fix any vulnerabilities reported that way. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Okay, I understand Learn more Latest Apple iPhone Users in Crosshairs of a Scareware Campaign AI, Machine Learning: Not Ready for Prime Time Led by AdultFriendFinder, Breached Records Spike 86% History Repeating: Top Five Database Threats Apple Dials Up Encryption as Mobile Threats Soar   News Topics Features Webinars White Papers Events & Conferences Directory Search Infosecurity Magazine Home » News » Apple Ransom Threat: Legitimacy is Elusive 24 Mar 2017 News Apple Ransom Threat: Legitimacy is Elusive Tara Seals US/North America News Reporter, Infosecurity Magazine Email Tara By now, you may have heard that a hacking organization identifying itself as the Turkish Crime Family has gone hunting for a very big fish: It said that it has credentials for hundreds of millions of Apple accounts of various sorts (including email and iCloud), and it’s threatening to wipe all of the iPhones in the cache unless a hefty ransom is paid. The group is asking for either $75,000 in Bitcoin or $100,000 in iTunes gift cards before the April 7 deadline. It’s a major shakedown—but is it legitimate? Turkish Crime Family (let’s call them TCF) was first reported by Vice’s Motherboard as having 559 million total accounts—and other reports say there are either 200 million or 300 million vulnerable iPhone accounts. Regardless of the number, it’s a lot—and on the surface the news, if TCF really does have those credentials, would indicate that Apple has suffered a major data breach. But the computing giant says it hasn’t. Apple said in a media statement: “There have not been any breaches in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud and Apple ID. The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services. We're actively monitoring to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and are working with law enforcement to identify the criminals involved. To protect against these type of attacks, we always recommend that users always use strong passwords, not use those same passwords across sites and turn on two-factor authentication." Which means that the danger, if it does exist, isn’t new for these Apple users. And indeed, many of the accounts could be defunct: Some of the addresses are @mac.com and @me.com addresses, which could be almost two decades old. Motherboard confirmed a back-and-forth conversation between the hackers and Apple security teams, but TCF has yet to publicly provide solid proof of how and what information they have, besides a YouTube video (now removed) that Motherboard said shows someone logging into an iCloud account. Meanwhile, ZDNet said that it was able to get a data sample of 54 allegedly breached accounts from TCF—finding that they were all legitimate email addresses. The outlet also reached 10 users that said the listed pilfered passwords were correct. What does it all add up to, if anything? John Bambenek, threat systems manager of Fidelis Cybersecurity, said that he’s skeptical about the hacker group’s claims, noting that there are always people who make unfounded threats to organizations in the hope of an easy payday—or notoriety. “The hacker group is not following what’s become typical operating procedure,” he said via email. “For example, if this were a real ransomware attack, they would be communicating privately with the company they are targeting. Based on previous incidents, the current threat has all the hallmarks of a stunt. If they really have the ability to wipe iPhones then they would have wiped a few already as ‘proof of life’.” But that said, do consumers really want to roll the dice with their pictures and other information on the phone? Lamar Bailey, director of security research and development for Tripwire, said via email that the hackers may have indeed been able to meticulously assemble a cohesive database of previously stolen Apple credentials by making use of various former data breaches of sources outside of Apple—this is a good highlight once again of the widespread problem of password re-use. Hundreds of millions of them? Possibly. It would have required a large effort, but he noted that it could be done. “If this is legit, the hackers would have had to obtain access to the individual user accounts via breaking the passwords of each of the user accounts or have acquired access to the Apple iCloud servers,” he said. “The access to each user account is much more realistic since we have seen numerous reports of all the weak passwords people use for their computers and accounts.” And, he added, if the hackers have password access to individual user accounts, they can indeed erase phones remotely and change passwords for the Apple account. “The hackers cannot remove backups for Apple devices from the cloud, but changing the passwords will make it hard for the legitimate users to reset and recover their devices,” he noted. “Once the end-user has access to their account, they will be able to restore their device.” Apple users—and indeed all users of any online-facing service—should make sure they’re using strong passwords and enabling two-factor authentication as an added protection. “Having a local backup of your device is always a good idea too. It is faster to restore a device locally than over the internet, and having a small NAS (Network Attached Storage) device at home for pictures and backups is a good investment to supplement the cloud backups,” Bailey added.

Based on our initial analysis, the alleged iPhone vulnerability affected iPhone 3G only and was fixed in 2009 when iPhone 3GS was released,” Apple said in a statement. “Additionally, our preliminary assessment shows the alleged Mac vulnerabilities were previously fixed in all Macs launched after 2013.” #DarkSeaSkies: CIA’s tool to hack #MacBookAir in under 29 seconds exposed by #Wikileakshttps://t.co/IPNYkCkJmZpic.twitter.com/6aXe5fTfAB— RT (@RT_com) March 23, 2017 Apple was referring to CIA tools such as NightSkies, DarkSeaSkies, Triton and Sonic Screwdriver used to infiltrate the iPhone, MacBooks and desktops. “Apple's claim that it has ‘fixed’ all ‘vulnerabilities’ described in DARKMATTER is duplicitous,” WikiLeaks tweeted in response. “EFI [Extensible Firmware Interface] is a systemic problem, not a zero-day [vulnerability in software or hardware that can be exploited to hack systems and is often later patched.]” Apple's claim that it has "fixed" all "vulnerabilities" described in DARKMATTER is duplicitous.

Here are three things you should do right now. By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols for Zero Day | March 24, 2017 -- 19:41 GMT (12:41 PDT) | Topic: Security Your Apple iCloud account may be open to attacks. Maybe the London-based hacker group -- which goes by the name "Turkish Crime Family" -- doesn't have access to 250-million Apple iCloud account names and passwords. But they do have access to some indeterminate number of accounts, and that's more than enough reason to exercise caution: Protect your iCloud password and data today or risk losing it tomorrow. Security 101 Tips for protecting your privacy from hackers and spies Take these simple steps to help protect yourself against hackers and government surveillance. Read More Here's how to do it. Back up vulnerable data First, you need to back up your iCloud data. Yes, I know Apple's idea was you could use iCloud to back up your Apple device data, and that's fine, but it's iCloud itself we're worried about today. For your iPhone, iPad, or iPod, the easiest way to do this is to back up your device's files to your Mac or PC with an iTunes backup. Plug your device into your Mac or PC with iTunes on. In iTunes' top left-hand corner, under the play controls, there's a tiny phone icon. Click here and it will take you to your device's menu. Click on Summary in the left-hand column. You will be presented with three boxes. Choose Select Backups. Choose to automatically or manually back-up your device. If you choose automatic, every time you plug your gadget in, iTunes will start to back it up. Backing up your Apple device locally, and not just to iCloud, is a good idea. The only problem here is that iTunes doesn't back everything up. For example, it won't back up your Apple Pay information and settings, photos already on iCloud, or purchased iTunes and App Stores content. So, to be safe, you really must change and secure your password. Change your passwords Apple could help here -- and not just by paying off the Turkish Crime Family. Other major sites -- like Amazon, Netflix, and LinkedIn -- buy cracked password lists, and use one-way hashing matches to check for existing passwords. They then reset vulnerable passwords and ask users to switch passwords. Apple hasn't done that, but it should consider doing it, given just how large the threat appears to be. Since Apple isn't doing this, it's up to you. More security news Senate votes to repeal broadband privacy rules How to protect your Apple iCloud account The uncrackable problem of end-to-end encryption Passwords: Workers say they will hand them over for next to nothing One thing that has always annoyed me is that Apple talks as if your Apple ID and iCloud ID are different. They're not. They're the same, and they use the same password. To change your Apple ID password, sign in to your Apple ID account page with any web browser and follow the instructions to reset your password. I changed mine using Google Chrome from a Mint Linux system. Your new Apple ID password must contain at least eight characters, a number, an uppercase letter, and a lowercase letter. You also can't use spaces, the same character three times in a row, your Apple ID, or a password you've used in the last year. Whatever you do, do NOT use dumb passwords such as "abcdefgh," "qwerty," or "password." The easiest way to create a secure password that won't try your memory is to use passphrases instead of passwords. Instead of working your nerves into a frenzy trying to memorize what the cat wrote when he jumped on the keyboard (e.g. "sdf9usdf"), use an easy-to-remember but nonsensical phrase instead. For example, "Plump/Trotting Pups:" or "UNC?Win!Duke?Lose!" or "AC!DC!Tesla!Edison?" These are easy to recall and hard for crackers to break. Once you've changed your password, you'll need to change it on all your Apple devices. Then, you're going to want to add another layer of protection: Two-factor authentication (2FA). 2FA Apple's 2FA is clunky, but it still does a great job of protecting your account. For additional protection, turn on Apple's two-factor authentication. When you activate 2FA, you can access your account only from trusted devices such as your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. When you want to sign in to a new device for the first time, you'll need to provide two pieces of information. These are your Apple ID password and the six-digit verification code that's automatically displayed on your trusted devices. To use Apple 2FA, you'll also need a trusted phone number so you can receive verification codes. To add a trusted phone number, take the following steps: Go to your Apple ID account page Sign in with your Apple ID Go to the Security section and click Edit Click Add a Trusted Phone Number and enter the phone number Now, you're ready for 2FA. For a trusted device, you need an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch with iOS 9 and later, or you need a Mac running OS X El Capitan or later that you've already signed into with 2FA. To turn on Apple 2FA, take the following steps. On your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch with iOS 9 or later: Go to Settings > iCloud > tap your Apple ID Tap Password & Security Tap Turn on Two-Factor Authentication On your Mac with OS X El Capitan or later: Go to Apple menu > System Preferences > iCloud > Account Details Click Security Click Turn on Two-Factor Authentication Yes, this can be a lot of work. On the other hand, how much work would it take you to replace your important photos, music, books, or documents if your Apple iCloud account goes up in smoke? Take the time, do it now. You'll be glad you did.

A new patent from Apple imagines combining a laptop’s body with an iPhone’s brain. By Emily Bary March 24, 2017 2:27 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large A recent Apple patent filing suggests we might soon be able to power laptop-like devices with just an iPad or iPhone. Illustration: United States Patent and Trademark Office Laptops could soon become shells of their former selves -- literally. Apple has filed a patent request for a thin accessory that would let you turn your iPhone or iPad into a laptop of sorts. You’d slide your iPhone into the space where the trackpad normally is or dock your iPad where the screen normally is. Then the mobile device would act as the brains. More from Barron’s Next Never Mind the Apple Watch, AirPods Are the Future How Long Can the iPhone Sustain Apple’s Rally? Apple: It’s No Longer About the iPhone This “electronic accessory device,” as Apple called it in the filing, might have features like a keyboard, ports, and additional processing power, but it wouldn’t be able to function without an iPhone or iPad, according to Apple Insider, which discovered the patent application. Of course, Apple files for a host of patents every year, and they don’t all end up becoming real-life products. But the fact that Apple is looking into such a device is an indication that the company acknowledges an uncertain future for traditional laptops, as people continue to do more and more complex tasks on their phones and tablets. (Apple already has been running iPad ads that remind folks they can in fact use Microsoft Word on the tablet.) The iPad, too, though, is in the midst of an identity crisis. Just this week, Apple unveiled a new model that was notable mainly just for its lower price. A device that makes iPads and iPhones more useful and powerful might cannibalize MacBook sales in the long run but also cement the relevance of Apple’s mobile products. Big Picture: Apple recently filed for a patent that would let people use an iPad or iPhone to power a laptop-like device.

Apple unveiled Tuesday a special red version of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, to commemorate the 10-year partnership between the tech giant and Red, an organization that helps fights AIDS. By Heather Kelly SAN FRANCISCO (CNNMoney) -- Apple is keeping things simple. Instead of trotting out Tim Cook for the typically big spring press conference, the company quietly announced a few product updates this week. It released a new iPad, added some watch bands, and introduced a new color for the iPhone 7. There are no gimmicky new features, no missing ports to fret over. So what do you actually need to know? The iPad is the cheapest yet Just call it "iPad." Like Charo or Oprah. Apple released a new 9.7-inch iPad that replaces the iPad Air 2 in its lineup. There's not much to it beyond the usual upgrades. It's faster and brighter with the same battery life. Inside is the A9 chip that made its debut in iPhones last year. What's most notable is that it is now the cheapest iPad available, costing $329 for the 32 GB Wi-Fi version. It's even cheaper than the smaller iPad Mini. The company hopes the price drop will appeal to first time iPad customers, perhaps enough to woo people who have purchased Android or Kindle tablets in the past. Apple wants to win back schools Since the early days of Steve Jobs, Apple has been active in education. Its iPad seemed like a natural fit for the classroom, but there have been some setbacks. Google has overtaken Apple in classrooms with its affordable and secure Chromebooks. Chromebooks now account for 51% of devices in K-12 classrooms in the US, according to a January report from Futuresource Consulting. Apple is also still smarting from the botched plan to give every student in the Los Angeles Unified School District an iPad. Apple had to pay back $4.2 million as part of a settlement. The new iPad is priced for education. Through Apple's educational programs, schools can actually get the new iPad cheaper, starting at $299. Apple has also been busy working on its educational apps like Swift Playgrounds, which teaches kids how to code. The new iPhones are exactly the same, but red and charitable The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus each come in a new metallic matte red finish. There is nothing else different about them. For those brave enough to skip a case, it's the most colorful option available. A portion of the proceeds from the red iPhones goes to The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which Apple has partnered with for a decade. Apple won't say what percentage of each iPhone sale goes to (RED), the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. It does say that it is the program's biggest corporate sponsor and has contributed $130 million since 2006. Nobody listens to videos anymore People use their phones to shoot video constantly, but they're usually not creating movies. Apple has designed a new app called Clips that tries to make editing a film dead simple. (Something iMovie's mobile app never quite mastered.) Its coolest feature is automatic captioning. It transcribes what you say while recording and overlays the video with text. Sites like Facebook and Twitter autoplay videos, but with the sound off by default. This has created a trend where people will just watch the videos without sound. News organizations and other video makers have responded by adding text to everything, and now iPhone filmmakers can do the same. The app will be available until April.

Jehnny Beth) [LISTEN] Music Lowe Talks AM/Beats 1 Strategy: “We Try To Put Music In A Frame” By Arron Hirst 24th Mar 17 8:04 pm Share Tweet An interesting piece over at CNET this weekend on the strategy Beats 1 head –Zane Lowe– has adopted to try and sustain industry and user excitement around Apple’s music service, and the global 24/7 station he now helms. In an exclusive interview Apple’s lead tastemaker explains that the original model when Beats 1 launched was to follow in the footsteps of traditional radio. “Now [it’s] not,” Lowe says, highlighting that Apple Music and Beats 1 have since switched gears to focus entirely on streaming and getting listeners physically excited about discovering those latest vibes … “We try to make as much noise and create as much context and tell stories for records and artists, within a place where the music is,” the Beats 1 exclusive said. “Imagine Apple Music as a store. We’re the front window. We’re the thing you see by the counter. We try and put music in a frame that makes you more excited about it, more than just its existence […]” “You could put the record in a playlist, put it in a library, just let is exist and hopefully we find it,” Lowe adds. Detailing the internet station’s current strategy further, Lowe continues: “But culture is what the artist wants it to be. They want to create layers of thought, excitement and vision, and tell you how the record was made. They want to share the experience with you. That’s what Beats 1 really is designed to do. It was to keep pace with the culture, so that it goes perfectly with the commodity.” A follow-up to the tastemaker’s keynote held at this year’s SXSW, the interview also touches on Lowe’s views regarding the internet (and streaming in general) having ‘thrown out the rulebook’ of old, instead fostering direct relationships between artists and fans, to which the executive responded: “It’s been going on forever. When I was at radio, exclusives were the way you get the audience, because you would have the records before they were released.” “That doesn’t happen anymore,” Lowe highlights. “Most records are out all at the same time, so everyone’s been forced to brush up on their editorial charms …” If you missed it, you can replay Zane Lowe’s full 45-minute keynote on Apple Music at SXSW – right here.

A London-based hacking group calling itself the Turkish Crime Family claims to have the passwords to 559 million iCloud accounts. Holding this data for ransom from Apple, the organization is demanding either $75,000 in a cryptocurrency like BitCoin, or $100,000 in iTunes gift cards. If Apple doesn’t comply by April 7, the criminals say they will reset these passwords and remotely wipe the iPhones associated with each account. MORE: 8 Ways to Keep Your Data Secure ZDNet did some investigation into the veracity of the threat, obtaining 54 of the accounts and their corresponding passwords from the hackers. Ten of these 54 were found to have been legitimately hacked. That ought to be enough to make you suspicious. Whether every logistical detail of this extortion is true or not, changing your iCloud password right now will go a long way in making the problem disappear — at least for yourself. Apple says there is no problem here. In a statement to Motherboard, the Cupertino firm says there “have not been any breaches in any of Apple's systems, including iCloud and Apple ID. The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services.” RELATED: How to Protect Your Privacy Online The company goes on to recommend that its users always choose strong passwords, not repeat passwords across sites, and to enable two-factor authentication. It’s good advice; take it. Security analysts have remarked on the disparity between the size of the alleged breach and the relatively low amount sought in ransom. With 559 million accounts going to just $75,000, the Turkish Crime Family values each account at just 1.3 cents, or 1.7 cents in iTunes credit. Have you changed your password yet? Want More?

Wikileaks leak may allow antivirus vendors to tell Apple has already fixed most of the iOS exploits the CIA used Video Why You Lost Your Windows 10 Product Key The Mac and iPhone exploits described in new documents attributed to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency were patched years ago, according to Apple. WikiLeaks released a new set of files Thursday that supposedly came from the CIA. They contain details about the agency’s alleged malware and attack capabilities against iPhones and Mac computers. The documents, dated 2012 and earlier, describe several “implants” that the CIA can install in the low-level extensible firmware interface (EFI) of Mac laptop and desktop computers. These EFI rootkits allow the agency's macOS spying malware to persist even after the OS is reinstalled. [ Further reading: How the new age of antivirus software will protect your PC ] According to WikiLeaks, the documents also describe an implant that the CIA can load onto factory-fresh iPhones through “interdiction” -- the interception and manipulation of electronics shipments on their way to the final buyer. Based on Apple's preliminary analysis of the new WikiLeaks disclosures, the iPhone vulnerability described in the files affected only the iPhone 3G and was fixed in 2009 with the release of the iPhone 3GS, an Apple representative said in an emailed statement. The Mac-related vulnerabilities were fixed in all Mac computers released after 2013, the representative said. WikiLeaks said it would share unpublished details about vulnerabilities from the CIA's arsenal with technology vendors whose products were affected. However, it wants vendors to agree to certain terms first, including a 90-day patch deadline. Apple appears unwilling to negotiate and claims that so far it has not received any information aside from what WikiLeaks has already published. “We have not negotiated with Wikileaks for any information,” the Apple representative said. “We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. We are tireless defenders of our users' security and privacy, but we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users.” To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Home About Testimonials News Widget Guidelines Syndicate faq Blog Contact     High School Programming Teacher, Craig Briggs, Releases Mobile Game: Truck Trials Driving Challenge Craig Briggs, a programming teacher released his very first mobile game, Truck Trials Driving Challenge, available in the Google Play and Apple App Stores. Play it YOUR way Online PR News – 24-March-2017 – Wellington – Craig Briggs, a high school programming teacher and developer passionate about providing his students with the best possible educational experience with regards to creating games and programming at various levels, this week officially released his very first mobile game, Truck Trials Driving Challenge, now available in the Google Play and Apple App Stores. An interactive platform game where the player, as the truck, has to navigate each level and collect three fuel cans along the way to continue to play, Truck Trials Driving Challenge combines Briggs’ two favorite genres: platform games and puzzle games such as the incredible machine. “Many of my students began to ask me how to write a physics-based computer game, something I had no prior experience with,” said Briggs. “About 16 months ago, I decided to have a go at writing a simple game so that I could better help my students discover their passion for programming. This simple game began to develop as I discovered that I really enjoyed the development process. The idea behind the Truck Trials game came as a result of combining a few different interactive genres: puzzle games, driving games, and platform games.” The game is split into different stages with increasing difficulty as the game progresses. The simple objective is to navigate the truck to the three different fuel cans while getting it to the end of the level. To do this, users are able to drag objects onto the screen in order to make it so the truck can complete the level. As the levels progress, the objects change, first beginning as easy, simple objects like ramps and slanted shapes, changing into much more advanced objects like harpoons, rocket launchers, transportation vortexes, and more. “It’s a great mental exercise that is also fun, engaging, and definitely addictive,” said Briggs. “I am incredibly excited to announce my first mobile game is officially available for download in the App Stores.” Truck Trials Driving Challenge comes with 40 different levels and two different themes, making it an extensively challenging and long-lasting game. It is a completely free game to download and play today. For more information or to view snapshots of the game trailer, visit: http://www.trucktrials.com/.

The documents released by the anti-secrecy site Thursday morning pointed to an apparent CIA program to hack Apple devices using techniques that users couldn't disable by resetting their devices. The iPhone hack was limited to the 3G model from 2008. In a statement late Thursday, Apple said the flaw was fixed with the release of the iPhone 3GS a year later. Apple also said the Mac vulnerabilities were all fixed in all Macs launched after 2013. Apple's statement was consistent with assessments from security experts, who say that many of the apparent vulnerabilities were in older technology. Apple is going further in saying those flaws have all been fixed, based on its preliminary analysis. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Security experts say the exploits described in the WikiLeaks documents are plausible, but suggest they pose little threat to typical users. Besides being likely out of date, the techniques also typically require physical access to devices, something the CIA would use only for targeted individuals, not a broader population. The CIA has not commented on the authenticity of this and earlier WikiLeaks revelations, but has previously said it complies with a legal prohibition against electronic surveillance "targeting individuals here at home, including our fellow Americans." The leaks Thursday came about two weeks after WikiLeaks published thousands of alleged CIA documents describing hacking tools it said the government employed to break into computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs from companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. WikiLeaks has offered to share further details with tech companies to help them fix flaws, though accepting such information might subject companies to certain conditions and put government contracts at risk. Apple addressed the offer for the first time in Thursday's statement. "We have not negotiated with WikiLeaks for any information," the statement read. "We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn't in the public domain." Apple said that while it takes users' security and privacy seriously, "we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users." Earlier, Microsoft said WikiLeaks had made initial contact through its public reporting channel, "and we have followed up, treating them as we would any other finder." Mozilla, the organization behind the Firefox web browser, also said it had been contacted through the email address it uses for security vulnerability reporting. Mozilla said it would take steps necessary to fix any vulnerabilities reported that way.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Kirby: All in favor of voting yes on every Mormon sustaining?

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile What a (RED) iPhone 7 Would Look Like with a Black Front (Hint: Stunning!) By Uzair Ghani Mar 23, 2017 38Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple surprised everyone by finally releasing a (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. But it’s not exactly what everyone had hoped for. Apple’s (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus Looks More Slick with a Black Front Panel While Apple did eventually deliver a red iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in all its striking glory, the overall aesthetics are not exactly what some were hoping for. Many people out there, even me, were expecting a red smartphone with a black front panel, unlike what Apple released a couple of days back. I’m not saying it looks bad or anything in its current form, but the level of slickness would have gone through the roof if Apple had taken the black on red route. How do I know this? Just check out these renders by Benjamin Geskin on Twitter. Related T-Mobile’s JUMP! Upgrade Program Adds Free AppleCare+ Services Now tell me – doesn’t it look gorgeous? Here’s an image of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus which we officially got from Apple. Advertisement It would’ve been great if Apple didn’t offer the new iPhone in just one front finish. Just allowing the buyer to select between a black or white would have gone a long way for a lot of people. But it seems as though that plan from Apple didn’t make the cut this time around. If the iPhone 8 retains this color option upon release, then there’s a high chance we might get lucky. But I still wouldn’t suggest holding your breath for it just yet. There’s a possibility that Apple’s (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7 move is a one-off thing. So cherish it while it lasts. Related Someone Swapped the (RED) iPhone 7 Plus’ White Front Panel with a Black One – Video As highlighted before, the (RED) and regular iPhone 7 have no internal differences whatsoever. Both models are identical in every possible way you can imagine except for the paint job you get out of the box. Furthermore, it should be noted here that the new color option is available in just two storage capacities: 128GB and 256GB. If you were hoping to pick one up in the 32GB flavor, then you are absolutely out of luck. Do let us know in the comments section what you think about the above render. Do you think Apple made the right choice going with a white front instead of black?

Instead of trotting out Tim Cook for the typically big spring press conference, the company quietly announced a few product updates this week. It released a new iPad, added some watch bands, and introduced a new color for the iPhone 7. There are no gimmicky new features, no missing ports to fret over. So what do you actually need to know? The iPad is the cheapest yet Just call it “iPad.” Like Charo or Oprah. Apple released a new 9.7-inch iPad that replaces the iPad Air 2 in its lineup. There’s not much to it beyond the usual upgrades. It’s faster and brighter with the same battery life. Inside is the A9 chip that made its debut in iPhones last year. What’s most notable is that it is now the cheapest iPad available, costing $329 for the 32 GB Wi-Fi version. It’s even cheaper than the smaller iPad Mini. The company hopes the price drop will appeal to first time iPad customers, perhaps enough to woo people who have purchased Android or Kindle tablets in the past. Apple wants to win back schools Since the early days of Steve Jobs, Apple has been active in education. Its iPad seemed like a natural fit for the classroom, but there have been some setbacks. Google has overtaken Apple in classrooms with its affordable and secure Chromebooks. Chromebooks now account for 51% of devices in K-12 classrooms in the US, according to a January report from Futuresource Consulting. Apple is also still smarting from the botched plan to give every student in the Los Angeles Unified School District an iPad. Apple had to pay back $4.2 million as part of a settlement. The new iPad is priced for education. Through Apple’s educational programs, schools can actually get the new iPad cheaper, starting at $299. Apple has also been busy working on its educational apps like Swift Playgrounds, which teaches kids how to code. The new iPhones are exactly the same, but red and charitable The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus each come in a new metallic matte red finish. There is nothing else different about them. For those brave enough to skip a case, it’s the most colorful option available. A portion of the proceeds from the red iPhones goes to The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which Apple has partnered with for a decade. Apple won’t say what percentage of each iPhone sale goes to (RED), the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. It does say that it is the program’s biggest corporate sponsor and has contributed $130 million since 2006. Nobody listens to videos anymore People use their phones to shoot video constantly, but they’re usually not creating movies. Apple has designed a new app called Clips that tries to make editing a film dead simple. (Something iMovie’s mobile app never quite mastered.) Its coolest feature is automatic captioning. It transcribes what you say while recording and overlays the video with text. Sites like Facebook and Twitter autoplay videos, but with the sound off by default. This has created a trend where people will just watch the videos without sound. News organizations and other video makers have responded by adding text to everything, and now iPhone filmmakers can do the same. The app will be available until April.

WikiLeaks released a new set of files Thursday that supposedly came from the CIA. They contain details about the agency’s alleged malware and attack capabilities against iPhones and Mac computers. The documents, dated 2012 and earlier, describe several “implants” that the CIA can install in the low-level extensible firmware interface (EFI) of Mac laptop and desktop computers. These EFI rootkits allow the agency's macOS spying malware to persist even after the OS is reinstalled. According to WikiLeaks, the documents also describe an implant that the CIA can load on to factory-fresh iPhones through “interdiction,” the interception and manipulation of electronics shipments on their way to the final buyer. Based on Apple's preliminary analysis of the new WikiLeaks disclosures, the iPhone vulnerability described in the files affected only the iPhone 3G and was fixed in 2009 with the release of the iPhone 3GS, an Apple representative said in an emailed statement. The Mac-related vulnerabilities were fixed in all Mac computers released after 2013, the representative said. WikiLeaks said it would share unpublished details about vulnerabilities from the CIA's arsenal with technology vendors whose products were affected. However, it wants vendors to agree to certain terms first, including a 90-day patch deadline. Apple appears unwilling to negotiate and claims that it has not received any information aside from what WikiLeaks has already published. “We have not negotiated with Wikileaks for any information,” the Apple representative said. “We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. We are tireless defenders of our users' security and privacy, but we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users.” To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

By Johanna Bennett Biography March 24, 2017 2:00 p.m. ET David Paul Morris/Bloomberg With Apple’s share price once again flirting with a record high, it seems that all anyone talks about is the next big iPhone launch. Buzz surrounding the coming 10-year anniversary iPhone is growing ever louder. Early Friday Nomura Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal sweetened his price target for Apple AAPL 2.072685973878478% Apple Inc. U.S.: Nasdaq USD143.8 2.92 2.072685973878478% /Date(1490734803214-0500)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 28804034 AFTER HOURS USD143.77 -0.0300000000000011 -0.02086230876216968% Volume (Delayed 15m) : P/E Ratio 17.238323353293413 Market Cap 739132586320.996 Dividend Yield 1.5839933305543976% Rev. per Employee 1874840 More quote details and news » AAPL in Your Value Your Change Short position (ticker: AAPL) by 20% to $165 a share arguing that sales of the so-called iPhone 8 (as it is commonly called by analysts) due to debut late this year will shatter expectations and help fuel estimate-beating profit growth. Yet high hopes for the iPhone 8 aren’t the only reason to take a bigger bite out of Apple. Let’s not forget, it is one of the few technology companies that pay a cash dividend to shareholders. RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani forecasts that the iPhone maker is poised to announce next month plans to significantly increase the capital it returns to shareholders with a $35 billion boost to its existing share buyback plan and a 15% dividend hike. Add that to forecasts for accelerating earnings growth, and “the fundamental reality remains that Apple’s valuations are materially subpar,” says Daryanani. More From Barron’s Our Independent Advisory All-Stars Grubhub Shares Could Slide 25% as Competition Grows The Bull Market: 6 Things to Ignore, 3 to Worry About He isn’t alone seeing Apple as a bargain. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) became one of the company’s biggest shareholders late last year when it added the stock to its portfolio. It’s not hard to see why some investors might be tempted to sell. At a recent $141.47, Apple’s share price has recovered dramatically from the selloff that marred 2015 and continued early last year, when Apple posted a full-year revenue decline for the first time in 15 years. But as Barron’s Jack Hough noted last week, iPhones aren’t falling out of favor and Apple’s high-margin services business continues to race higher. In fact, Barron’s Next noted recently that Apple’s services business could be a $50 billion concern by 2020, and the opportunity from things like AppStore, iTunes, AppleCare and iCloud are underappreciated by investors. The next iPhone launch is certainly a significant event. And analysts are using the terms “supercycle.” Yet much of the enthusiasm seems baked into the stock. And cautious voices on Wall Street warn that Apple needs to diversity its business. But there is much more to the Apple story than the iPhone8. With $240 billion in cash sitting on foreign shores, Apple could get a boost from President Trump, namely a proposed tax policy that would make it cheaper for companies to repatriate offshore cash. The “increased probability” of repatriation could get Apple’s management talking about long-term dividend payout targets, namely hiking its payout ratio. The current dividend payment totals $12 billion a year. Yet even in the absence of repatriation, Apple’s domestic free cash flow — expected at just under $22 billion this year — is more than enough to sustain a 15% dividend hike, Daryanani says. Moreover, Apple’s net cash position has grown to $159 billion. So the board has plenty of dry powder to cover the $31 billion remaining on its existing share buyback plans and to expand it. Granted, at 15.3 times forward earnings, Apple is trading near its highest price to earnings multiple in five years. But there is much to like including a respectable 1.6% dividend yield. Comments?

The documents released by the anti-secrecy site Thursday morning pointed to an apparent CIA program to hack Apple devices using techniques that users couldn't disable by resetting their devices. The iPhone hack was limited to the 3G model from 2008. In a statement late Thursday, Apple said the flaw was fixed with the release of the iPhone 3GS a year later. Apple also said the Mac vulnerabilities were all fixed in all Macs launched after 2013. Apple's statement was consistent with assessments from security experts, who say that many of the apparent vulnerabilities were in older technology. Apple is going further in saying those flaws have all been fixed, based on its preliminary analysis. Security experts say the exploits described in the WikiLeaks documents are plausible, but suggest they pose little threat to typical users. Besides being likely out of date, the techniques also typically require physical access to devices, something the CIA would use only for targeted individuals, not a broader population. The CIA has not commented on the authenticity of this and earlier WikiLeaks revelations, but has previously said it complies with a legal prohibition against electronic surveillance "targeting individuals here at home, including our fellow Americans." The leaks Thursday came about two weeks after WikiLeaks published thousands of alleged CIA documents describing hacking tools it said the government employed to break into computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs from companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. WikiLeaks has offered to share further details with tech companies to help them fix flaws, though accepting such information might subject companies to certain conditions and put government contracts at risk. Apple addressed the offer for the first time in Thursday's statement. "We have not negotiated with WikiLeaks for any information," the statement read. "We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn't in the public domain." Apple said that while it takes users' security and privacy seriously, "we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users." Earlier, Microsoft said WikiLeaks had made initial contact through its public reporting channel, "and we have followed up, treating them as we would any other finder." Mozilla, the organization behind the Firefox web browser, also said it had been contacted through the email address it uses for security vulnerability reporting. Mozilla said it would take steps necessary to fix any vulnerabilities reported that way.

Based on Apple's preliminary analysis of the new WikiLeaks disclosures, the iPhone vulnerability described in the files affected only the iPhone 3G and was fixed in 2009 with the release of the iPhone 3GS, an Apple representative said in an emailed statement. The Mac-related vulnerabilities were fixed in all Mac computers released after 2013, the representative said. WikiLeaks said it would share unpublished details about vulnerabilities from the CIA's arsenal with technology vendors whose products were affected. However, it wants vendors to agree to certain terms first, including a 90-day patch deadline. Apple appears unwilling to negotiate and claims that so far it has not received any information aside from what WikiLeaks has already published. “We have not negotiated with Wikileaks for any information,” the Apple representative said. “We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. We are tireless defenders of our users' security and privacy, but we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users.” ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Tech Apple Science Cars Baselworld 2017 Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     2017 IMac: Rumors, Features, Release Date And Everything You Need To Know Posted: Mar 26 2017, 1:32am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Mar 26 2017, 10:26pm CDT, in News | Apple     Apple is expected to release a new iMac in 2017. The last time Apple updated the iMac was in 2015. Apple is expected to release a new iMac in 2017. There is not really evidence that this is going to happen, but the anticipation grows. Don't Miss: Enter the I4U News NES Classic Giveaway! Apple has been under fire for neglecting the desktop for a while now. Microsoft used Apple's moment of weakness in a perfect way. The Surface Studio makes the iMac look like ancient technology. Microsoft in a way is helping Apple iMac fans to get a new iMac sooner than later. The new 2017 iMac needs to be innovative in design and functionality to match Microsoft's stunning device. 2017 iMac Features We can take some pointers from the new MacBook Pro that Apple release end of 2016. Apple might introduce the Touch Bar in the 2017 iMac. Apple has patented the integration of the OLED touch screen on standalone keyboards. LG already said in 2015 that Apple is coming out with an iMac featuring an Retina 8K display. This of course did not happen. One thing that Apple is fond of is though resolution. An iMac Retina 8K is technically possible. The 8K resolution would also allow Apple to give the iMac a bigger screen option. How does a 34" iMac with 8K Display, Core i7 sound? The new iMac will adopt USB-C like the MacBook Pro. This change requires to get new adapters for your peripherals and has already caused a ruckus at the launch of the 2016 MacBook Pro.  The are some rumors floating around that Apple would adopt the new AMD CPU Ryzon, replacing Intel. This is not very likely, but possible as Apple uses AMD GPUs in the iMac. 3D is exploding in a big way on Windows 10 this spring. Virtual Reality is driving 3D creation, but Apple has so far no solution for this new big trend. The next iMac ideally would have powerful graphics to drive a virtual reality headset. Right now creative companies have to get a Windows Gaming PC to use an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. Apple is rumored to work on an augmented reality solution. That is though likely only for the iPhone. 2017 iMac Release Date At this point it is just guessing. April is a possibility for Apple's first event in 2017. Another option is the WWDC 2017, kicking off on June 5. The WWDC kicks off with a keynote that usually brings new Apple hardware. The new iMac requires a media event. WWDC 2017 is the perfect stage for a new iMac reveal. Apple just unveiled a bunch of new products including a new iPad and iPhone SE on March 21. The iPhone Plus Red went on sale on March 24. 2017 iMac Price The Microsoft Surface Studio is $800 more expensive in the top configuration than any iMac currently available. The new iMac prices could match Microsoft's prices for the top configuration. The lower end iMac models will likely be priced the same or drop slightly. The 2015 iMac starts at $1,099. The most expensive iMac configurable on apple.com has a price of $3,999. iMac deals are available on amazon.com. Should I Wait to Buy a new iMac? We recommend to hold off with the purchase of a new iMac until at least WWDC 2017. If Apple is not releasing the 2017 iMac in June, the release will be in fall. Apple will not launch the new iMac during the summer. Registration for the WWDC 2017 tickets opens Monday, March 27 at 10:00 a.m. PDT. The opportunity to buy tickets to WWDC17 will be offered by random selection. To register, you must be a member of the Apple Developer Program or Apple Developer Enterprise Program. What is the iMac? In Apple's words: "The idea behind iMac has never wavered: to craft the ultimate desktop experience. The best display, paired with high-performance processors, graphics, and storage — all within an incredibly thin, seamless enclosure. And that commitment continues with the all-new 21.5‑inch iMac with Retina 4K display. Like the revolutionary 27‑inch 5K model, it delivers such spectacular image quality that everything else around you seems to disappear. Adding up to the most immersive iMac experience yet — and another big, beautiful step forward." The iMac is the perfect desktop machine, but it is time for new power, new design, and bigger and better screen. Read the latest Apple News.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search PRODUCT RED iPhone 7 up close (and available) Chris Burns - Mar 24, 2017 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit A Special Edition of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have been made available by Apple in collaboration with PRODUCT RED. Today we’ve got the iPhone 7 Plus PRODUCT (RED) Special Edition in-hand to see it up close and personal. This device is identical to any other iPhone 7 Plus, save the exterior backside, buttons, and SIM tray. That, and a portion of the proceeds will go to PRODUCT RED, of course. In addition to the main metal body of the iPhone coming in a brand-spot-on red tone, the antenna plastic is red as well. As are the buttons, and the mute switch. The SIM card tray is also the same lovely red tone as the rest of the iPhone 7 Plus’ body. This is an exercise in quality control, to be sure – even more than usual, that is to say. The back of the iPhone 7 Plus (and the non-plus, for that matter) in PRODUCT RED Special Edition tones has a mirror Apple logo. This is similar to other iPhone 7 Plus units in the series while the rest of the back is, as mentioned, quite red. It should be plainly obvious that this tone will go over well during the holiday season later this year – unless, of course, this special edition is replaced by another special edition (of another smartphone set) by then. The official statement from Apple on the proceeds reads as such: “A portion of the proceeds from every (PRODUCT)RED purchase will go to the Global Fund to fight AIDS in Africa.” Two versions of the iPhone 7 Plus are available for the PRODUCT RED Special Edition. One is the 128GB internal storage capacity version, the other has 256GB of internal storage. The smaller of the two iPhone 7 Plus PRODUCT RED Special Edition devices will cost around $869 delivered sim-free and off contract. The larger of the two will cost $969 USD. These are the same prices that the same internal storage capacity models cost with any other color available from Apple for the iPhone 7 Plus.

Here’s Why It Matters Montblanc Launched a Smartwatch. Here’s Why It Matters Mar 24, 2017 Chris Rovzar | Bloomberg EMAIL Tweet Comments 1 Bloomberg Advertisement (Bloomberg) -- Last week, Montblanc became the first brand in the Richemont family of luxury companies to put out a smartwatch. The Montblanc Summit, based on Google's Android Wear 2 platform, aims to compete with, among others, the Apple Watch and rival Swiss brand TAG Heuer's Connected Watch (which was released last year and received a major update in the form of a modular version this month). Like the TAG, which is also on the Android platform, the Montblanc watch is targeted to fans of the brand. By designing the case to look like a classic mechanical watch from its 1858 line, it hopes to attract a mix of loyalists and also millennials who aren't necessarily accustomed to wearing anything on their wrists but who might try out a unique-looking smartwatch. "We hope that the Summit shows customers new and old that Montblanc is rooted in innovation and adapts to what the modern professional needs," said Montblanc Chief Executive Officer Jérôme Lamberg. The differences between the TAG and Montblanc versions are not vast—they both offer an array of Android apps. While the TAG has GPS for sports apps and NFC for making mobile payments, the Montblanc watch has a heart-rate monitor embedded in the back of the case. They both come loaded with watch faces that look like their iconic models, which these companies swear is important, but to me slightly misses the point. Fans love mechanical watches for their ingenuity, beauty, and internal structural achievement—a dimly-lit 2D simulacrum on a screen, cased in something that looks like a mechanical watch, is hardly the same thing The Greater Market Smartwatches have become a large category but have still undersold compared with expectations. Market research firm IDC estimates that 19.8 million smartwatches were shipped in 2016, missing a 28.3-million projection by almost half. In the third quarter of last year, for example, Apple Watch sales were down more than 70 percent. A large part of the problem is that makers of this kind of wearable (as opposed to a simpler, more purpose-built Fitbit) haven't yet really made a case for why its users need them, when a smartphone is almost always near at hand. Think about it. If you own a smartwatch, and you accidentally leave it at home, what do you do when you get to work or school and you realize it's not with you? Then think about what happens when you leave your phone at home. Improving by Iteration When Apple Inc. launched its series 2 watch in September 2016, it featured improvements based on feedback from communities that use the device.  "A significant difference between the first and most recent versions of Apple Watch software is that a lot of what you want to do, from functional stuff to what's just plain fun, lives at the top layer of the UI now," explains Jack Forster, an industry expert and the editor-in-chief of the watch enthusiast website Hodinkee. "It's often simple stuff, but it makes a huge difference in the experience. For instance, you can change the watch face now much more easily and without navigating submenus. There's a familiar-to-Mac-users app dock now, and so on." The Apple Watch 2 also featured built-in GPS, which meant that a runner or cyclist could hit the road without having to carry a phone—a huge difference for athletes. Smaller Brands  While Apple owns more than 40 percent of the smartwatch market, according to IDC, you'll find more community enthusiasm, in my experience, for such watches as Garmin's sports offerings—which offer exactly what outdoor athletes want.  "Dedicated fitness trackers still do a better job at filling specific needs, although there are other mission-specific smartwatches out there that show how much room there is left to innovate and clarify product identity," explains Forster. "Casio makes trekking-oriented smartwatches, for instance." The same IDC report that had smartwatches on the decline listed Garmin Ltd. as the industry's one bright spot, increasing more than 300 percent year over year. (That report came out right as the Apple Watch 2 was hitting stores and does not reflect a bump that may have come from the new technology.) If Swiss watchmakers and Apple and Google want to make smart timepieces more essential, it's good that brands with smaller, more specialized communities are having watches made just for them.  ​Montblanc's Summit Watch "Smartwatch makers are creating products with a clearer identity," says Forster. For example, the Montblanc watch comes with a clever, intuitive worldtimer app that was built for the timepiece. Why? Montblanc users are travelers.  "The Montblanc customer is a modern, on-the-go professional that enjoys the luxury heritage lifestyle/status that Montblanc is known for," explains Lambert, the CEO. "Today’s Montblanc customer is living in a digital world where connectivity is key to success." At 46mm across, the watch is large, as well. That's too big for my wrist, but it's huge for a reason. "This large face, made with curved glass, allows for users to play in various apps and text or email with ease," Lambert added.  Future versions of the Summit may link with Montblanc's Augmented Paper (paper notebooks that record your writing into the cloud) in a work/play ecosystem that suits fans of the brand perfectly. Say you're traveling business class on a flight from Dubai and you can't bring on a laptop or tablet. Suddenly your phone, your watch, and such gadgets as Augmented Paper become much more important. A Long Road Analyst John Guy of Mainfirst Bank estimates that the Connected Watch has come to represent less than 10 percent of TAG Heuer total sales over the past year; in other words, it didn't change TAG's bottom line or its business model. And it likely won't, at least for a while. (In pricing, the Swiss are nowhere near competing with Apple. At roughly $960 for the Montblanc and $1,500 for the TAG, they way overshoot the $369 Apple Watch 2.) But they are teaching the Swiss brands what their users want from a smartwatch—if anything. "I think it's still not entirely clear to a lot of players in the traditional watch space why their fans would want a smartwatch version of their watches," says Forster. "Which isn't very surprising, because I don't think the tech world in general has figured that out either. "Manufacturers feed new designs into the marketplace, and consumers say to themselves, 'Well, I didn't know it, but I really do want one,' and as various products are accepted or rejected, manufacturers refine their approach."

Opera is drie jaar geleden overgestapt van de in eigen huis ontwikkelde render-engine Presto naar Blink. Deze maakt deel uit van Chromium, dat onder meer ook door Google Chrome gebruikt wordt. Opera is beschikbaar voor Windows, Linux en macOS. Er zijn ook versies voor BSD en Solaris, maar deze zijn nog op de oude technologie gebaseerd. In versie 44 is onder meer ondersteuning toegevoegd voor de Touch Bar van Apple's nieuwe MacBook Pro. Opera 44 goes final with support for Apple’s new Touch Bar Today, Opera becomes the first major browser after Apple’s Safari to introduce support for the Touch Bar in a final version. How you can browse with Touch Bar Opera’s implementation of Touch Bar enables contextual actions such as going back, focusing the address field, and navigating through Speed Dials. The most interesting feature for most of you will probably be navigating through multiple tabs as you slide your finger across the website icons. Icons have different colors and backgrounds, giving you a nice-looking and distinguishable overview of your tabs. When we first saw the Touch Bar, we immediately recognized how it could be useful for the browser, allowing people to switch tabs without lifting their eyes from the keyboard to the tab bar on top of the screen. We were surprised to find Safari’s implementation to show tiny thumbnails of web pages in the relatively small touchbar area. Under the hood Opera 44 features our own tuned-up version of Chromium 57. This adds support for CSS Grid Layout and WebAssembly which we believe has the potential to bring browser games to the next level. Try one out here. Also from Chromium, the new background tab throttling has been added, providing additional energy consumption reductions to the battery saver feature introduced to Opera in May 2016. Opera 44 also adds support for the Credential Management API. This gives users a simpler sign-in process across devices and provides websites with more control over the usage of credentials. The website can use password-based sign-ins via this API. Once logged in, users will be automatically signed back into a site, even if their session has expired.

It might be the largest cash reserve for any private company in history. So what is Apple going to do with all that dough?  One theory is that Apple will use its stockpile to buy Disney, according to RBC analyst Steven Cahall: "Bulls think it portends well for a swan song exit via a sale to a giant like AAPL," Cahall wrote in a note sent out to clients on Friday.  After all, we are living in a world where "content is king." Currently, there is a battle raging among content providers for your eyeballs. Content providers, want you hooked and ready to consume more of your favorite content and all of the other licensed products that go along with it.   When analysts and investors think of content, Disney is the first name that comes to mind.  Disney's "Frozen" is the highest-grossing animated film of all time. Additionally, five of the 10 highest grossing films of 2016 were Disney movies: "Captain America: Civil War" was the highest grossing film of 2016 with 1.153 billion in revenue, also included were, "Finding Dory", "Zootopia", "The Jungle Book", and "Star Wars: Rogue One."  RBC is not the only one speculating an Apple takeout of Disney is a possibility. In her fourth-quarter investor letter for 2016, Samantha Greenberg, founder of hedge fund Margate Capital, raised the same possibility, describing the company as a "logical acquisition target" for Apple: Apple has talked about the benefit Apple sees when it owns exclusive content, and owning Disney would reduce Apple’s exposure to product cycles, expanding AAPL's valuation multiple...It would also be an accretive use of Apple's cash and even more so if Apple's $200Bn of offshore cash can be repatriated favorably. Additionally, in November 2016, Liberty Media Chairman John Malone predicted that if Disney were to spin-off ESPN, Apple could buy it. "Fundamentally, Tim Cook is a global player, and fundamentally, ESPN is a domestic service," Malone said, that Apple and Disney would be a better fit without ESPN because then they would both be global players without domestic ESPN holding them back.   This a story that won't be dying down anytime soon.  Disney is up 7.75% so far this year, click here for a real-time DIS chart.

These books will help, whether you’re an absolute beginner or a seasoned expert. Trying your hand at developing for iOS can be tough, even if you have a background in programming. Between learning the Swift programming language The Fastest Way to Learn Swift Programming on the Move The Fastest Way to Learn Swift Programming on the Move There are many ways to learn the new Swift programming language, but have you thought about learning it on your mobile device? This app makes it really easy and effective. Read More , grasping the Apple ecosystem, and actually publishing to the App Store, there’s a lot to learn. Thankfully, there are plenty of great books that can help guide you through the process. The titles in this list cover a broad swathe of subject matter, and are appropriate for a wide range of learners. No matter what prior experience you have, one of these books will help you take the next step toward becoming a bona fide iOS developer. Beginners Just dipping your toes into the world of iOS app development? These texts should provide you with the introduction you need to get started coding. 1. Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (Free) Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs — informally referred to as either SICP or “the wizard book” — has been around for decades, but it’s still a great starting point if you’re new to programming 6 Easiest Programming Languages to Learn for Beginners 6 Easiest Programming Languages to Learn for Beginners Learning to program is about finding the right language just as much as it's about the edification process. Here are the top six easiest programming languages for beginners. Read More . The book was once used as the primary textbook for introductory programming classes at MIT and other prominent schools. SICP doesn’t focus on a particular programming language, so you won’t be learning about Swift as you make your way through the text. Instead, you’ll be grappling with some of the larger concepts that underpin app development. It’s a demanding read, but an effective way for novices to gain important foundational knowledge. 2. Swift Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide ($28) It’s difficult to dispute The Big Nerd Ranch‘s pedigree when it comes to developing for Apple hardware. Its founder, Aaron Hillegass, worked at NeXT in the 1990s, and in 2000 he took on a role helping Apple train software developers to use the company’s Cocoa API. The Big Nerd Ranch guide to Swift programming caters to people who are just starting out with Swift. You’ll learn the very basics until you’re ready to start writing your own code This App Teaches You Coding Basics in Minutes per Day This App Teaches You Coding Basics in Minutes per Day Want to pick up the basics of a programming language whenever you have a few spare minutes? Check out these awesome free apps. Read More . At the end of every chapter, there are exercises to complete to test your knowledge, alongside challenges that will push you a little further. If you’re starting Swift from the very beginning, there’s no better option. 3. iOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide ($15) The Big Nerd Ranch Guide to iOS programming is the perfect accompaniment to its corresponding guide on Swift programming. This book assumes some knowledge of Swift, but primarily focuses on the intricacies of deploying software to iOS. Used in unison, they’re a comprehensive course on what it takes to get an app onto the App Store Why Do Developers Keep Leaving the Mac App Store? Why Do Developers Keep Leaving the Mac App Store? Is the Mac App Store becoming a burden for Mac developers? We decided to talk to a few and find out. Read More . As you work your way through this book, you’ll learn the ropes by building working apps. This practical approach allows the authors to cover a lot of common scenarios that developers might come across. Even if it’s not a completely exhaustive guide, you’re sure to learn a great deal. 4. iOS Apprentice ($55) If buying both Big Nerd Ranch guides above is too much of an investment, consider iOS Apprentice. It’s aimed at complete beginners, and offers a crash course on everything you need to get started with iOS development by walking readers through the creation of four distinct apps. It pairs step-by-step guides with illustrations and screenshots that help explain the process. Plus, it comes with full source code and high quality images for each example, which you can use as a foundation for your own personal projects. Advanced If you’ve already advanced past the beginner stage and want to add a little more sparkle to your creations, these books can add more skills to your repertoire. 5. Swift Pocket Reference: Programming for iOS and OS X (Free) Once you’ve got some experience with Swift under your belt, the kind of literature you need to support your learning will change. Rather than books that guide you through exercises and activities, you’ll need reference materials that you can consult when you hit a dead end. Swift Pocket Reference: Programming for iOS and OS X is that kind of book. Unfortunately, there’s one caveat; this book is now a little outdated, as it was published in December 2014 and only covers Swift 2.0. However, to make up for that drawback, its publishers have made the guide available for free. It covers a broad range of topics, and it’s packed with detailed examples, so it’s a great book to have on hand as you move on from the basics to an intermediate level of knowledge. 6. Pro Swift ($30) Paul Hudson, the author of Hacking with Swift, wrote Pro Swift to help junior programmers go beyond the basics of the programming language. As such, it focuses on areas of study that won’t be covered by introductory guides, like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation in object-oriented Swift, operator overloading, and best practices for documentation markup. The course is comprised of a detailed guidebook and 90 DRM-free How to Remove the DRM on Every eBook You Own How to Remove the DRM on Every eBook You Own No one likes DRM. We all understand why it exists, but that doesn't mean we're ready to embrace it. Therefore, this article explains how to remove the DRM from every eBook you own. Read More videos that you can stream online or download to your system. The videos allow you to see techniques carried out step-by-step. This format allows learners to grasp advanced techniques, putting them in a real-world context as opposed to a dry chapter of a textbook. 7. iOS 10 App Development Essentials ($45) iOS 10 App Development Essentials is a great resource for anyone that’s looking to graduate from writing code to making apps. Like the Swift Pocket Reference book above, there’s plenty of content here that will help newcomers get started with Swift, but it’s more of a reference book than a beginners’ guide. Rather than just including snippets of code Become a Better Coder by Keeping a Programming Journal Become a Better Coder by Keeping a Programming Journal Keep a programming journal and tap into some obvious benefits. Writing a journal can help you work through your thoughts and keep track of your programming goals. Read More , this book is accompanied by simple programs that you can tinker with and tweak for yourself. If you’re experimenting and you hit a wall, this is a great book to have on hand. 8. The Core iOS Developers Cookbook ($37) The Core iOS Developers Cookbook offers up solutions to various challenges that rear their head during iOS development. Whether you’re adding motion effects to your app, getting to grips with the Auto Layout constraints system, or implementing APIs into your project, this text will help you through the process. If you’ve read other coding “cookbooks,” you’ll be familiar with the format. Rather than reading through sequentially, you’ll pick and choose sections as you reach hurdles in your work. As such, it’s particularly useful for anyone who’s starting an original project So You Want To Make iPhone Apps? 10 Projects For Beginners So You Want To Make iPhone Apps? 10 Projects For Beginners Want to create iPhone and iPad apps? Start by learning the basics of Swift. Read More , and is looking for a safety net for when things get difficult. Expert At some stage in your journey you will be ready to take on bigger and more complex challenges, which is where these expert-level texts come in handy. 9. Cocoa Design Patterns ($33) Cocoa Design Patterns is one of the older titles on this list — it was published in 2009. However, given that it covers patterns rather than quirks of a particular language, it’s still very relevant today. The book has lots of information for iOS developers, although being that it covers Cocoa as a whole, it’s also a good resource when it comes to macOS. However, this is a book for experts, through and through. It starts off with an introduction to the Model-View-Controller pattern, and ramps up from there. There simply isn’t enough space to cover the nitty-gritty of every single technique, so there’s a lot of assumed knowledge. However, if you already have some experience with iOS programming, you’re sure to find plenty of ways to enhance your skills with this book. 10. iPhone App Development: The Missing Manual ($28) Even if you’ve mastered Swift The Best Places to Learn Swift, Apple's Programming Language The Best Places to Learn Swift, Apple's Programming Language If you want to learn Swift, now is the time to dive in. The language has a bright future and the faster you learn it, the sooner you'll be able to reap the rewards. Read More , and you know the iOS platform like the back of your hand, there’s a lot to learn before your app tops the charts. Successful apps aren’t built on good coding alone — you need to understand design, branding, your audience, and more to compete with the best. The Missing Manual will help you translate your programming skills into a product that’s ready for the App Store. If you’re serious about publishing your app, this book will fill you in on the things you didn’t even know that you needed to know. Do you have another book on iOS development to recommend?

The Colony Organizer, priced at $60, is essentially a charging dock for your iPhone and iPad, designed to securely and stylishly hold your devices while they charge. Made from Maple or Walnut wood, the Colony Organizer can hold up to four devices and two charging cables between its series of pegs, keeping them neatly stored away on a desk or surface while charging. Charging cords (not included) run up through a center cutout in the organizer, and a felt base protects your devices from any scratches or damage. Micro suction pads on the base ensure that it's stable, so it's not going to fall over or slip off of your desk even when loaded with iPhones and iPads. It's compatible with the iPhone 5 and later, all Lightning-based iPads, the 12-inch MacBook, and the Apple Watch. Quell & Company's Leather Sleeve, priced at $95, is designed to work with the 12-inch MacBook or any 9.7-inch iPad, including Apple's newly released $329 model. The Leather Sleeve, as the name suggests, is made from a high quality black leather lined with felt. It features a zippered main pocket that fits your Apple device, along with three front pockets that can be used for other accessories like the Apple Pencil, charging cables, and even an iPhone. Quell & Company is offering a Colony Organizer and a Leather Sleeve to three MacRumors readers, who will be able to pick the color (organizer) and size (sleeve) of their choosing.

That doesn’t, however, mean you can get one in your hands today—unless you’re looking for the red iPhone and can get to your local Apple retail store. Apple’s new iPhone 7 PRODUCT(RED) Special Edition is available online and in stores now (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7 The (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus offer the same specs as the models arealdy available in stores, so other than color there isn’t anything new here. Some of the proceeds from the (PRODUCT)RED versions go to the Global Fund to eradicate AIDS. The 128 GB iPhone 7 costs US$$749 and the 128 GB version is priced at $849. The 128 GB iPhone 7 Plus is $869 and the 256 GB model costs $969. The red iPhone 7 models deliver on Tuesday, March 28. If you want get one earlier head over to your local Apple Store. Most have them in stock, so you can pick yours up today. 9.7-inch iPad The new entry level iPad model has an A9 processor and a brighter Retina display, and comes in WiFi and WiFi plus cellular data models. The WiFi-only model is priced at $329 with 32 GB storage or $429 with 128 GB storage, and the WiFi plus cellular data models cost $459 for 32 GB and $559 for 128 GB. If you’re hoping for instant gratification, get ready to be disappointed. The new iPad isn’t available in stores yet, and free shipping pushed delivery out to April 4th. If you’re willing to pay extra for shipping, you can get delivery somewhere between March 31st and April 3rd. No New Macs Apple didn’t say new Macs would show up on the store today, although that didn’t stop at least some people from hoping. Turns out Apple isn’t ready to update any Macs yet, so you’ll have to keep waiting for that new iMac, or (maybe) new Mac Pro.

But sample data seen by ZDNet shows that at least some of the data is valid login information. The blackmail story began on Tuesday, when Motherboard reported that a group calling itself "Turkish Crime Family" demanded $75,000 (£59,000) in either Bitcoin or Ethereum from Apple, or $100,000 (£79,000) in iTunes gift cards in return for deleting the iCloud user data it claimed to possess. Apple, however, released a statement denying that its servers had been hacked. Instead, it seems that the login information comes from the 2012 LinkedIn hack. Game over, right? Apple wasn't breached, so everything is fine? Well, not so much. Turkish Crime Family handed over sample data to ZDNet, which the publication verified as actual login information. The publication spoke to 10 people who verified their data. Despite the advice of security experts, many people re-use passwords over and over, meaning that if one of their accounts (apparently LinkedIn, in this case) is compromised, their others all become vulnerable too. So clearly people are at risk, even if it's not necessarily the millions of people that Turkish Crime Family claimed are affected. Apple, however, has only released one statement on the story, in which it denied it had been hacked, and said it is "actively monitoring to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and are working with law enforcement to identify the criminals involved." Contrast Apple's statement with the actions of Reddit and Twitter, which forced password resets on certain accounts after learning that login information for users had been posted online — even though the sites themselves hadn't been breached. Apple increased iCloud security in 2014 after celebrities had their private photos stolen and posted online using a weakness in iCloud accounts. It prompted users to use two-factor authentication, which requires a phone number to get into accounts. Encouraging users to change their passwords or to enable two-factor authentication now, in light of Turkish Crime Family's claims, could stop users having their accounts taken over or deleted. Apple said in its statement on the attempted blackmail that users should enable two-factor authentication for their accounts, but it has yet to email users or send notifications to their devices that their accounts could be at risk.

The documents released by the anti-secrecy site Thursday morning pointed to an apparent CIA program to hack Apple devices using techniques that users couldn't disable by resetting their devices. The iPhone hack was limited to the 3G model from 2008. In a statement late Thursday, Apple said the flaw was fixed with the release of the iPhone 3GS a year later. Apple also said the Mac vulnerabilities were all fixed in all Macs launched after 2013. Apple's statement was consistent with assessments from security experts, who say that many of the apparent vulnerabilities were in older technology. Apple is going further in saying those flaws have all been fixed, based on its preliminary analysis. Security experts say the exploits described in the WikiLeaks documents are plausible, but suggest they pose little threat to typical users. Besides being likely out of date, the techniques also typically require physical access to devices, something the CIA would use only for targeted individuals, not a broader population. The CIA has not commented on the authenticity of this and earlier WikiLeaks revelations, but has previously said it complies with a legal prohibition against electronic surveillance "targeting individuals here at home, including our fellow Americans." The leaks Thursday came about two weeks after WikiLeaks published thousands of alleged CIA documents describing hacking tools it said the government employed to break into computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs from companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. WikiLeaks has offered to share further details with tech companies to help them fix flaws, though accepting such information might subject companies to certain conditions and put government contracts at risk. Apple addressed the offer for the first time in Thursday's statement. "We have not negotiated with WikiLeaks for any information," the statement read. "We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn't in the public domain." Apple said that while it takes users' security and privacy seriously, "we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users." Earlier, Microsoft said WikiLeaks had made initial contact through its public reporting channel, "and we have followed up, treating them as we would any other finder." Mozilla, the organization behind the Firefox web browser, also said it had been contacted through the email address it uses for security vulnerability reporting. Mozilla said it would take steps necessary to fix any vulnerabilities reported that way.

Apple took its online store down early Tuesday morning in advance of the announcement of both products, indicating that they would go on sale at 8:01 AM PDT today. As all of the new products were already appearing on the Apple Store on Tuesday, most assumed that the ordering links would simply become active at the scheduled release time, however for whatever reason Apple has chosen to take its store offline again. While Apple released several other products earlier this week as well, only the new iPad, iPhone SE, and (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models were delayed until Friday. Other products that were announced earlier this week such as the iPad mini 4 (which was only a price change), and the new Apple Watch bands and iPhone cases were available for sale on Tuesday. While it’s unclear what else Apple has in store, the most likely explanation is that Apple has taken the store down specifically for the three new products going on sale today, as opposed to planning to debut anything else new.

But is it too little too late for the tablet market? Global tablet market share Share of hand-held device sales Source: Strategy Analytics Tablet & Touchscreen Strategies Service Even with a growing list of bells and whistles, sales of the iPad are sliding, losing 2.4 percentage points of global market share in the past year. Global ipad sales by quarter In millions of units sold Source: Apple The iPad’s troubles follow an industry trend where tablet sales have fallen, along with their share of handheld device market. Sales of Apple’s tablet dropped to 13.1 million units in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared to 16.1 million during the same period a year earlier.

Global tablet market share: Source: Strategy Analytics Tablet & Touchscreen Strategies Service This week's price cut and the introduction of the iPad Pro have been a couple of Apple's efforts to reverse declines. The new iPad boasts a 9.7-inch Retina display, A9 processing chip with co-processor and 8 megapixel camera. With more than 1.3 million apps available to users, the iPad has made some impressive strides in its nearly seven years. How the iPad has changed iPad April 2010 $599 Wi-Fi + 32GB of storage Weight: 1.6 pounds 9.7-inch touchscreen display No camera Battery life up to 10 hours A4 processing chip 65,000 apps iPad March 2017 $329 Wi-Fi + 32GB Weight: 1 pound 9.7-inch Retina display 8 megapixel camera 10 hours of battery life A9 processing chip with co-processor More than 1.3 million apps The iPad Pro was essentially Apple’s first pass at the 2-in-1 category epitomized by Microsoft Surface computers. Such machines have detachable (often optional) keyboards and thus serve as hybrids between tablets and laptops. Strategy Analytics senior analyst Eric Smith notes it took Microsoft three tries with Surface before it got it right. Photo: Apple “Price is a key barrier for high-powered 2-in-1s right now,” Smith says. “Consumers want them, especially as hard choices lie ahead as to which computing devices will be replaced.” The phone remains essential, he says, but the choice between tablet and PC poses a dilemma. Adds IDC senior research analyst Jitesh Ubrani, "Regardless of what marketers are saying, detachable tablets are simply not putting pressure on notebooks yet."

(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images) By Troy Wolverton | twolverton@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: March 24, 2017 at 9:30 am | UPDATED: March 24, 2017 at 9:51 am When it comes to subscription music services, Spotify and Apple dominate the market. But a third big player in the music industry is about to offer consumers another choice. Pandora, provider of the popular Internet radio service, is rolling out its own on-demand music offering, called Pandora Premium. The company is hoping that by building on its radio service, its new subscription music business will stand out from its rivals. I like the result. Pandora is offering an easy-to-use, very personalized music service. All subscription streaming music services offer users the same proposition. Consumers pay a monthly fee — typically around $10 for an individual listener — to access a universe of music. Subscribers can play any one of millions of songs any time they like and usually can save songs or albums to their devices for offline listening. They can also create playlists or have the service create custom radio stations based on their favorite songs. Related Articles Biz Break: Demand for Pandora Premium could reach beyond listeners Pandora swallows Rdio for $75M Spotify and Apple Music offer those features and so does Pandora Premium, which the company has begun to offer to select users and plans to open up more broadly in coming weeks. Where the services differ is in how they are customized to individual users. Spotify tailors its service to users as it goes along; the more you use the service, the more it knows about your tastes. Apple Music tries to jump start the process by having users, when they sign up, select genres and artists that they like. Pandora, by contrast, is building on what it already knows about its 81 million radio listeners, gleaned from all the songs they’ve listened to, the stations they’ve created and the songs they’ve liked. If you’ve listened to Pandora radio in the past, there’s a good chance that you’ve tapped its “thumbs up” button. That button allows radio listeners to indicate that they like a particular track and would like Pandora to play more songs like it. Now Pandora is using that information for its Premium service to create playlists. Pandora sees playlists as a key way to distinguish its service from its competitors. Right now, creating playlists can be time consuming on both Spotify and Apple Music — users often have to build a playlist by adding songs or albums one by one. Pandora Premium promises to automate this tedious process. Subscribers access Pandora Premium through the same Pandora app they use to get to the company’s radio offering. After signing up for the on-demand service, consumers who have listened to Pandora radio in the past will see a playlist dubbed “My Thumbs Up” prominently displayed. That playlist contains all the songs users have ever given a thumbs-up to while listening to Pandora Radio. So, instead of having to search for particular songs or albums or comb through other people’s playlists, users instantly get access to a collection of songs that Pandora already knows they like. Reading this on your phone? Stay up to date with our new, free mobile app. Get it from the Apple app store or the Google Play store. For some people who have used Pandora Radio for years, that playlist might be unwieldy. I’ve been listening to Pandora for about a decade, so mine consists of 974 songs. And since I’ve created or tuned into multiple stations and liked songs within many of them, those songs don’t all go together very well. But that’s OK, because Pandora has ways to easily create more tailored playlists. If you start listening to one of Pandora’s radio stations and press the thumbs up button a few times, Pandora Premium will automatically offer to create a playlist based on all the songs you’ve given a thumbs up to within that station. If you’ve “liked” a lot of songs in that station in the past, you’ll instantly have a large collection of tracks that likely go together better than those in your “My Thumbs Up” playlist. Alternatively, Pandora will help you create a playlist from an individual song. Spotify and Apple Music give you a similar option. But they generally expect you to add songs to that playlist yourself. By contrast, when Pandora Premium shows you the new playlist you’ve created from that song, it gives you the option to “add similar songs.” Tap on that button, and the service will add another five or so songs to your playlist, typically a combination of tracks from both the same artist and from other artists in the same genre. The feature works a lot like one that Apple used to have built into its iPhone Music app called Genius Playlist that would automatically create playlist based on a single song from the music you had on your phone. With the feature on Pandora, you can manually delete or add songs or keep tapping the “add similar songs” button to fill it out. Company representatives said the feature tailors the selection to each individual user, based on their tastes as indicated by what they’ve listened to and “liked” in the past. So, if two users create a playlist from the same song and then click the “add similar songs” button, they likely will end up with very different playlists. But Pandora is using the data it’s collected about its users to personalize its service in other ways. From the app’s home page, users can choose to “browse” music. From the resulting page, they’ll see a list of new albums Pandora is recommending based on what it knows about their tastes. They’ll also see a list of “recommended artists” that’s personalized to them. And the app will do a cool trick, automatically downloading a selection of songs based on your recent listening history so that you can continue to listen to music when you are offline. Pandora will refresh that download music the next you go back online. Pandora Premium is in its early days and the company is still refining it. So, compared to Spotify and Apple Music, it has some notable shortcomings. For now, unlike those services, you can’t use it on a tablet or on your computer. Instead, it only works on a smartphone or through devices that connect to a smartphone, like Google’s Chromecast or some cars that offer Apple’s CarPlay. Pandora plans to add support for other products — including tablets, computers and some digital set-top boxes — in the near future. Unlike Spotify and Apple Music, Pandora is only offering individual memberships for premium. You can’t yet get a family membership or a student discount, although the company says it will offer both in coming months. Like the other services, there are some songs, like those on Taylor Swift’s “1989” album, that Pandora doesn’t have the rights to stream on demand. But if you happen to own that or similar albums, Pandora, unlike Apple Music, doesn’t offer users a way to upload it to the company’s servers so you can access it from the cloud. Despite those shortcomings, I liked Pandora Premium, particularly its automated playlists. It’s a worthy alternative to streaming music’s giants. Pandora Premium on-demand subscription music service Troy’s rating: 8 out of 10 Likes: Personalized, automated and easy-to-create playlists; tailored song and album recommendations. Dislikes: Only works on smartphones and smartphone connected devices for now; doesn’t yet offer family or student rates; doesn’t offer a way to upload and store personally owned songs.

New documents from WikiLeaks, posted Thursday, March 23, 2017, point to an apparent CIA program to hack Apple's iPhones and Mac computers such that the exploits persist even after the devices are reset to factory conditions. Apple says the purported hacking techniques have all been fixed in recent iPhones and Mac computers. (AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato, File) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........NEW YORK — Apple said purported hacking vulnerabilities disclosed by WikiLeaks this week have all been fixed in recent iPhones and Mac computers. The documents released by the anti-secrecy site Thursday morning pointed to an apparent CIA program to hack Apple devices using techniques that users couldn’t disable by resetting their devices. The iPhone hack was limited to the 3G model from 2008. In a statement late Thursday, Apple said the flaw was fixed with the release of the iPhone 3GS a year later. Apple also said the Mac vulnerabilities were all fixed in all Macs launched after 2013. Apple’s statement was consistent with assessments from security experts, who say that many of the apparent vulnerabilities were in older technology. Apple is going further in saying those flaws have all been fixed, based on its preliminary analysis. Security experts say the exploits described in the WikiLeaks documents are plausible, but suggest they pose little threat to typical users. Besides being likely out of date, the techniques also typically require physical access to devices, something the CIA would use only for targeted individuals, not a broader population. The CIA has not commented on the authenticity of this and earlier WikiLeaks revelations, but has previously said it complies with a legal prohibition against electronic surveillance “targeting individuals here at home, including our fellow Americans.” Advertisement Continue reading The leaks Thursday came about two weeks after WikiLeaks published thousands of alleged CIA documents describing hacking tools it said the government employed to break into computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs from companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. WikiLeaks has offered to share further details with tech companies to help them fix flaws, though accepting such information might subject companies to certain conditions and put government contracts at risk. Apple addressed the offer for the first time in Thursday’s statement. “We have not negotiated with WikiLeaks for any information,” the statement read. “We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn’t in the public domain.” Apple said that while it takes users’ security and privacy seriously, “we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users.” Earlier, Microsoft said WikiLeaks had made initial contact through its public reporting channel, “and we have followed up, treating them as we would any other finder.” Mozilla, the organization behind the Firefox web browser, also said it had been contacted through the email address it uses for security vulnerability reporting. Mozilla said it would take steps necessary to fix any vulnerabilities reported that way.

The California-based company bought the automation app called Workflow.  The report was first published at TechCrunch. The report doesn’t disclose the financial part of the deal. But why Apple wanted to invest on Workflow. What is so special about his app? If you don’t know how Workflow works allow me to tell you. The app can take a series of tasks, that the user would perform with various apps, and allows them to just press one button and complete the task. So instead of opening various applications to arrange a meeting you can let Workflow combine together apps and run a series of commands. According to the report the app was created by a small team that includes Ari Weinstein, a former iPhone jailbreaker and it has been around for a couple of years. Ari Weinstein said in a statement about the acquisition: “We are thrilled to be joining Apple.” “We’ve worked closely with Apple from the very beginning, from kickstarting our company as students attending WWDC to developing and launching Workflow and seeing its amazing success on the App Store. We can’t wait to take our work to the next level at Apple and contribute to products that touch people across the world.” It is one of the most innovative and intelligent applications and most of the users praise its functionality. And it seems that the tech company had an eye to the app for a long time. Workflow was granted an Apple Design award in 2015. Dean Hudson, Apple’s Accessibility engineer was really impressed by Workflow’s functionality and he stated: “When I first saw the app, I was just like man, this accessibility is cray-cray. This is off the charts!” Apple, also, released an announcement about Workflow: “The Workflow app was selected for an Apple Design Award in 2015 because of its outstanding use of iOS accessibility features, in particular an outstanding implementation for VoiceOver with clearly labeled items, thoughtful hints, and drag/drop announcements, making the app usable and quickly accessible to those who are blind or low-vision.” Many believe that the tech giant could not achieve what Workflow did, so they decided to go the easy way and buy it. But, in my opinion maybe the California company can make it better and bring it to more people.

The initial iPhone 8 stock will be so low that it’ll sell out almost immediately after preorders start, a new report explains. Recent reports have claimed that production for certain iPhone 8 components will only commence in the third quarter, suggesting that Apple may not have enough iPhone 8 stock to meet demand at launch. A new research note from Barclays, obtained by MacRumors, says the majority of iPhone 8 stock might not be available until later in the fourth quarter. “Suppliers generally had good things to say about the upcoming iPhone 8 launch (for our purposes iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and iPhone Pro) as new features drive a more complicated manufacturing process and higher ASPs,” the report notes, referring to the iPhone 8 as the iPhone Pro. The iPhone 8 is also known as the iPhone X or iPhone Edition, as Apple has yet to announce a formal name for the upcoming handset. “We now believe that all three devices will feature wireless charging and will all be launched in the normal September timeframe, although the majority of iPhone Pro volumes may not be available until Q4,” the report adds. The analysts at Barclay also reiterated many of the iPhone 8 rumors we’ve heard before. The iPhone 8 should sport a 5.8-inch display, 5.15 inches of which will be usable. The Touch ID fingerprint sensor will be embedded in the screen, and the remaining space around it might be used for virtual buttons. The phone will come with support for wireless charging, but the wireless charger will not be included in the box. Other specs include a front-facing 3D sensor module, a dual camera on the back, and a stacked logic board design that will let Apple pack a bigger battery inside the iPhone.

Giving some insight to usage, Apple analyst Gene Munster at Loup Ventures today released his “Apple Pay State of the Union” giving a look at adoption among retailers and much more. Using the Internet Retailer top 100, the data shows retailer adoption as a percentage of potential adoption. The adoption includes all possible points of adoption for the platform including point of sale, in app, and through Apple Pay on the web for website checkout on both mobile and desktop browsers. Among the numbers, 31% have implemented at least one point of adoption, while an impressive 44% of the Internet Retailer 100 have adopted Apple Pay at point of sale. A similar 40% have adopted it as an in-app payment option. When looking at those that have adopted Apple Pay at all possible points of adoption, it currently sits at 22% for the top 100. The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac Apple Pay State Of The Union: 2,091 banks accept Apple Pay globally, up from 1,439 in July of 2016. We estimate about 13% of active iPhones have activated Apple Pay. We estimate 30% of new iPhones are activating Apple Pay. 53% of retailers listed as “coming soon in browsers” have launched in the first 6 months. 31% of retailers in the Internet Retailer 100 accept Apple Pay, up from 28% in Oct. 44% of retailers in the Internet Retailer 100 have adopted Apple Pay at point of sale. 40% of retailers in the Internet Retailer 100 have adopted Apple Pay in-app. 13% of retailers in the Internet Retailer 100 have adopted Apple Pay in mobile browsers. 9% of retailers in the Internet Retailer 100 have adopted Apple Pay in desktop browsers. 22% of all possible points adoption leverage Apple Pay within the Internet Retailer 100. Apple Pay adoption among users is trickier, and Munster notes that he can only estimate that around 30% of new iPhone users are activating Apple Pay based on Apple’s now somewhat outdated figures released last year: Consumer adoption of Apple Pay. Consumer adoption is the most important and most difficult metric to measure. Based on a data point Apple disclosed in April 2016, we believe that users are activating Apple Pay on about 30% of new iPhones. In total, we estimate that 13% of the 680m iPhones in use today have activated Apple Pay. We do not have any data on usage of Apple Pay by iPhone users. Apple reported that transactions were up “nearly 500% y/y” in the Sept. 2016 quarter. The report also notes that Apple Pay is now up to 2,091 supported banks globally. That’s up from 1,439 in July 2016. Apple has been continually adding more banks and credit unions to its list of those supported by Apple Pay. Earlier this month it rolled out the service in Ireland as the 14th country to accept the service alongside the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, and Singapore. The latest reports hint that Apple could next bring the service to Taiwan, Germany and Italy. You can read Gene’s full report at Loup Ventures here.

Sponsored Content: Why Governance, Risk and Compliance is Everyone’s Business - Download the Executive Brief Today. Stocks are on track for their biggest weekly loss of 2017. Advertisement Technology companies are making the biggest gains, continuing a strong run over the last few months. Chipmaker Micron Technology surged after its second-quarter earnings were much better than analysts expected. Also rising were utility companies like WEC Energy and PG&E, and consumer-focused companies like Starbucks, Nike, and clothing company PVH. DURABLE GOODS US durable goods orders rose in February, led by aircraft WASHINGTON (AP) — Greater demand for commercial aircraft helped U.S. businesses increased their orders for long-lasting manufactured goods in February, but a key category that tracks business investment plans slipped slightly. The Commerce Department says orders for durable goods rose 1.7 percent in February and an upwardly revised 2.3 percent in January. Orders so far this year are running 1.6 percent higher than in the first two months of 2016. But demand in a category that excludes aircraft and military goods — and reflects business investment plans — dipped 0.1 percent. Orders for commercial aircraft saw a 47.6 percent jump in February. Orders also rose for primary metals. But demand for motor vehicles slumped. Manufacturers are recovering from a rough patch that began in 2015 as oil prices fell and the dollar strengthened. KEYSTONE PIPELINE Trump administration approves Keystone XL pipeline WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump says “it’s a great day for American jobs” after his administration issued a permit to build the long-delayed Keystone XL pipeline. The decision marks a reversal from the Obama administration and clears the way for the $8 billion project to be completed. The president says the decision ushers in a “new era” of American energy policy and will reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. The decision caps a years-long fight between environmental groups and energy industry advocates over the pipeline’s fate. The permit was signed by Tom Shannon, a career diplomat serving as undersecretary of state for political affairs. That’s because Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recused himself due to his previous work running Exxon Mobil. Keystone will carry tar sands oil from Canada to refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast. US-CONGRESS-HEALTH-OVERHAUL Ryan briefs Trump on status of bill WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Paul Ryan has gone to the White House to brief President Donald Trump on the state of play on the health care bill. The visit comes ahead of a planned showdown vote on the legislation later in the day Friday. The outcome was looking dicey with the legislation apparently still short of votes around midday, and few public signs that the situation was changing. A group of conservative hold-outs had yet to swing in favor despite lobbying from Trump and others, while opposition also came from moderate-leaning and rank-and-file Republicans. The legislation is the GOP’s long-promised bill to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama’s health care law. Trump decided Thursday that negotiations were over and it was time to vote. TREASURY-MNUCHIN Mnuchin says administration tax plan coming soon WASHINGTON (AP) — Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says after the battle over health care, the administration will turn quickly to tax reform with the goal of getting a program approved by Congress by August. Mnuchin says the administration will tackle cutting both individual taxes and corporate taxes in the same bill rather than divide the issues into separate bills. He did not reveal whether the administration will include a contentious border adjustment tax that is in a House tax proposal, saying the proposal had positive and negative aspects. In a wide-ranging public interview event with the news site Axios, Mnuchin also said President Donald Trump’s proposal to boost infrastructure spending would probably include $100 billion to $200 billion in federal money and depend on public-private ownerships to boost the total to $1 trillion. TRUMP-CHARTER Cable company to hire 20K workers over 4 years WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is praising a plan by cable company Charter Communications to invest $25 billion and hire 20,000 American workers over the next four years. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Charter Communications CEO Thomas Rutledge joined Trump at the White House for the announcement. Rutledge says that the company will return the call center jobs acquired through Time Warner Cable to the United States, opening a new call center in McAllen, Texas, and hiring 600 workers there. Trump says the plans will be great for American workers. The president is telling Rutledge, “you watch, it will be one of your really fantastic decisions.” KRAFT HEINZ LAYOFFS Kraft Heinz lays off 200 white-collar workers in Canada, US PITTSBURGH (AP) — Kraft Heinz Co. has laid off 200 white-collar workers in Canada and the United States. Michael Mullen, the company’s senior vice president of corporate and government affairs,, says the company is realigning its administrative functions to be more efficient. The company didn’t say where the layoffs occurred. Kraft Heinz is dually headquartered in Pittsburgh and Chicago since the Pittsburgh-based H.J. Heinz Co. and Kraft Foods Group of Illinois merged two years ago. The company has about 41,000 employees worldwide. The workers being laid off have all been notified and Mullen says the company appreciates their contributions. STATE UNEMPLOYMENT Hiring rises in 11 US states last month, gains widely spread WASHINGTON (AP) — Hiring picked up in 11 states last month compared with January and was mostly unchanged in the other 39, as stronger U.S. job gains benefited most of the country. Still, pockets of weakness remained. The Labor Department says that hiring in February was most robust in states outside the coastal regions that have fared the best since the Great Recession. The biggest gains, as a proportion of total jobs, were in Montana, Nebraska, Arkansas, and New Mexico. Unemployment rates fell sharply in 10 states and rose significantly in Massachusetts, with little change in the other 39. Hiring trends are more apparent when compared with a year ago. In the past 12 months, job gains were strongest, in percentage terms, in Idaho, Utah and Nevada, all states in the Mountain region. WIKILEAKS-CIA Apple: Software flaws in latest WikiLeaks docs are all fixed NEW YORK (AP) — Apple says purported hacking techniques released by WikiLeaks this week have all been fixed in recent iPhones and Mac computers. Documents released Thursday pointed to an apparent CIA program to hack Apple devices using techniques that users couldn’t disable by resetting their devices. The iPhone hack was limited to the 3G model from 2008. In a statement late Thursday, Apple says the flaw was fixed with the release of the iPhone 3GS a year later. Apple also says the Mac vulnerabilities were all corrected in all Macs launched after 2013. Apple’s statement is consistent with assessments from security experts, who say that many of the apparent vulnerabilities were in older technology. Apple is going further in saying those flaws have all been remedied, based on its preliminary analysis. FORD-INVESTIGATION Feds close probe of Ford SUV door ajar lights without recall DETROIT (AP) — U.S. safety regulators have decided not to seek a recall after investigating complaints that door ajar warning lights won’t turn off on thousands of Ford SUVs. The probe began in September and found nearly 2,700 complaints and over 33,000 warranty claims due to the problem with the 2011 to 2013 Edge SUV. The complaints included 14 drivers who said doors had opened unexpectedly. Over 440,000 SUVs were covered by the investigation. But the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration determined the doors were either opened by passengers or were not latched properly. The agency found no unreasonable safety risk because the latches work correctly and no crashes or crash-related injuries were reported. Ford determined that contamination can build up on switches that activate the door ajar lights, causing them to fail. BREADED CHICKEN RECALL Oklahoma company recalls 466 tons of breaded chicken product OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — An Oklahoma food company is recalling more than 466 tons (422 metric tons) of breaded chicken because of possible metal in the food. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Friday that OK Food, Inc. is recalling 933,272 (423,329 kilograms) pounds of the food shipped nationwide that was produced between Dec. 19, 2016, and March 7, 2017, and includes the number “P-7092” inside the USDA inspection mark. The USDA said in a news release that contamination came from metal conveyor belts and was discovered Tuesday. An agency spokesman did not immediately return a phone call for further comment. The agency says there have been no confirmed reports of injury, but consumers should either throw the product away or return it to the place of purchase. COD COLLAPSE Maine’s cod fishermen have worst year in history ROCKPORT, Maine (AP) — The cod isn’t so sacred in Maine anymore. The fish-and-chips staple was once a critical piece of the state’s fishing industry, but state records show 2016 was historically bad. Fishermen brought less than 170,000 pounds (77,110 kilograms) of the fish to land in Maine last year. That was below the previous record low of 250,000 pounds (113,398 kilograms) a year earlier. Maine’s record year for cod was 1991, when fishermen brought more than 21 million pounds (9.5 million kilograms) to the docks. Fishermen say they’re struggling with tight quotas. Scientists say populations have plummeted. The Sacred Cod is the nickname of a wood carving of the fish that hangs in the Massachusetts Statehouse. That state remains the center of the nation’s Atlantic cod fishery, but it is in jeopardy, as well. Catch fell from nearly 100 million pounds (45.3 million kilograms) in 1980 to less than 3 million (1.36 million kilograms) in 2015. GERMANY-US-GUMMY BEARS Sweet news: Germany’s Haribo to produce gummy bears in USA BERLIN (AP) — Germany’s iconic gummy bear will soon be “Made in USA.” Bonn-based Haribo, which invented the gummy bear nearly a century ago, said Friday it would open a U.S. factory in Wisconsin in 2020. Haribo, founded in 1920, has been in the U.S. since 1982 with a sales operation, and is already the top seller of gummy bears in the country, but says it wants to grow further. Company head Hans Guido Riegel says “Haribo of America is the fastest growing confectionary company in the U.S.A., therefore the step of starting our own production there from 2020 is important for us.” The $242 million factory near Kenosha is expected to create 400 jobs. Haribo employs 7,000 people worldwide and produces 100 million gummy bears daily at 16 factories in ten countries.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com WikiLeaks: CIA Hacked Apple Devices in Ways Users Can't Fix By Anick Jesdanun PUBLISHED: MARCH 24 2017 New documents from WikiLeaks point to an apparent CIA program to hack Apple's iPhones and Mac computers using techniques that users couldn't disable by resetting their devices. Security experts say the exploits are plausible, but suggest they pose little threat to typical users. They say that many of the tricks are older -- the iPhone hack involves the 3G model from 2008, for instance. The techniques also typically require physical access to devices, something the CIA would use only for targeted individuals, not a broader population. "The most notable part of this latest WikiLeaks release is that it shows the CIA doing exactly what we pay them to -- exploit specific targets with limited attacks to support our national interests," said Rich Mogull, CEO of the security research firm Securosis. Apple didn't respond to a request for comment. The CIA has not commented on the authenticity of this and earlier WikiLeaks revelations, but has previously said it complies with a legal prohibition against electronic surveillance "targeting individuals here at home, including our fellow Americans." The agency declined further comment Thursday. Document Dump The leaks Thursday come about two weeks after WikiLeaks published thousands of alleged CIA documents describing hacking tools it said the government employed to break into computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs from companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. The latest disclosures are much more focused and consist of just 12 documents, all involving Apple products. The documents describe techniques for rewriting devices' firmware in ways that would maintain a hacker's access even if a user resets a phone or computer to factory settings. Doing so wipes out all apps and the operating system and installs a clean version; it is an extreme measure sometimes used to deal with technical problems, but is also the sort of step that someone suspicious of surveillance might take when getting a brand new phone. A December 2008 document describes "NightSkies," a tool apparently designed to target the iPhone 3G; the document claims it can retrieve files such as contact lists and call logs and execute other commands. WikiLeaks suggested in a press release that the "CIA has been infecting the iPhone supply chain of its targets since at least 2008." However, the document describes only how to install the malware on a "factory fresh" version of the 3G -- specifically, the iPhone 3G running the 2.1 version of Apple's operating system, both of which are now nine years old. Caveats Galore But infecting all phones somewhere in the manufacturing process would be extremely difficult, said Mogull, especially given multiple layers of inspections conducted by Apple and its contractors. At most, he said, the CIA might have shipped a rogue phone individually to a target. And while it's possible that the CIA developed similar techniques for later iPhone models, Mogull said iPhones from the past few years have much greater security, including digital security certificates that cannot be overwritten. A flag would be raised during the setup process if certificates do not match. Johannes Ullrich, director of the Internet Storm Center at the SANS Institute, said NightSkies might not even be a current project given that the document was last updated in 2008, while the leaks appear to have come in 2016. Other documents released describe similar exploits for Mac computers. One hides in the firmware of Apple's Thunderbolt-to-Ethernet adapter and requires someone to plug in that adapter to install the malware. Another targets a specific Mac model, the MacBook Air with the Leopard version of the Mac OS system -- current at the time, but now seven generations old. Ullrich said the Mac exploits all appear old. He added that some of the Thunderbolt issues have been fixed to make the hack more difficult to pull off. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

Flight Ban on Devices Announced Next Article > U.K. Wants WhatsApp Accessible to Authorities PUBLISHED: MARCH 27 2017 Westminster Bridge attacker Khalid Masood sent a WhatsApp message that cannot be accessed because it was encrypted by the popular messaging service, a top British security official said Sunday. British press reports suggest Masood used the messaging service owned by Facebook just minutes before the Wednesday rampage that left three pedestrians and one police officer dead and dozens more wounded. As controversy swirled over the encrypted messages, police made another arrest in Birmingham, England, where Masood had lived. The 30-year-old is one of two men now in custody over possible links to the attack. Neither has been charged or publicly named. Masood was shot dead on the grounds of Parliament. Home Secretary Amber Rudd used appearances on BBC and Sky News to urge WhatsApp and other encrypted services to make their platforms accessible to intelligence services and police trying to carrying out lawful eavesdropping. "We need to make sure that organizations like WhatsApp -- and there are plenty of others like that-- don't provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other," she said. Rudd did not provide any details about Masood's use of WhatsApp, saying only "this terrorist sent a WhatsApp message and it can't be accessed." But her call for a "back door" system to allow authorities to retrieve information is likely to meet resistance from the tech industry, which has faced previous law enforcement demands for access to data after major attacks. In the United States, Apple fought the FBI's request for the passcodes needed to unlock an iPhone that had been used by one of the perpetrators in the 2015 extremist attack in San Bernardino, California. The FBI initially claimed it could obtain the data only with Apple's help, but ultimately found another way to hack into the locked phone. Masood drove a rented SUV into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before smashing it into Parliament's gates and rushing onto the grounds, where he fatally stabbed a policeman and was shot by other officers. A detailed police reconstruction has found the entire attack lasted 82 seconds. Police are trying to pinpoint his motive and identify any possible accomplices, making the WhatsApp message a potential clue to his state of mind and his social media contacts. Rudd said attacks like Masood's would be easier to prevent if authorities could penetrate encrypted services after obtaining warrants similar to the ones used to listen in on telephone calls or -- in snail mail days -- to steam open letters and read their contents. Without a change in the system, she said terrorists would be able to communicate with each other without fear of being overheard even in cases where a legal warrant has been obtained. Rudd also urged technology companies to do a better job at preventing the publication of material that promotes extremism. She plans to meet with firms Thursday about setting up an industry board that would take steps to make the web less useful to extremists. British police investigating the attack say they still believe Masood, a 52-year-old Briton, acted alone and say they have no indications that further attacks are planned. Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said it may never be possible to fully determine Masood's motives. "That understanding may have died with him," Basu said Saturday night as police appealed for people who knew Masood or saw him to contact investigators. "Even if he acted alone in the preparation, we need to establish with absolute clarity why he did these unspeakable acts, to bring reassurance to Londoners." The Islamic State group, which is losing territory in Iraq and Syria but still has radical followers in other parts of the world, has claimed Masood was a "soldier" carrying out its wishes to attack Western countries. Masood had convictions for violent crimes in the U.K. and spent time in prison. He also worked in Saudi Arabia teaching English for two years and traveled there again in 2015 on a visa designed for religious pilgrimages. Along with the man arrested Sunday, a 58-year-old man detained in Birmingham several days ago remains in custody in the case. Nine others arrested after the attack have been freed without charges, while one person was released on bail. The family of slain police officer Keith Palmer, meanwhile, released a statement thanking those who tried to save his life. "There was nothing more you could have done. You did your best and we are just grateful he was not alone," the statement said. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved. Image credit: iStock.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Mar 25, 2017 - Page 12　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp CIA developed tools to spy on Macs: WikiLeaks NY Times News Service, SAN FRANCISCO The CIA developed tools to spy on Mac computers by injecting software into the chips that control the computers’ fundamental operations, the latest cache of classified government documents published on Thursday by WikiLeaks showed. Apple said in a statement that its preliminary assessment of the leaked information indicated that the Mac vulnerabilities described in the disclosure were previously fixed in all Macs launched after 2013. However, the documents also indicated that the CIA was developing a new version of one tool last year to work with current software. The leaked documents were the second batch recently released by WikiLeaks, which said it obtained a hoard of information on the agency’s cyberweapons programs from a former government worker or contractor. The first group of documents, published on March 7, suggested that the CIA had found ways to hack Apple iPhones and Android smartphones, Microsoft Windows computers, Cisco routers and Samsung smart televisions. Since the initial release of the CIA documents, which the agency has not confirmed are authentic, major technology companies have been scrambling to assess whether the security holes exploited by the CIA still exist and to patch them if they do. WikiLeaks frontman Julian Assange has offered to share the precise software code used by the CIA’s cyberweapons with the affected companies, but major tech companies have been reluctant to directly engage with him for fear of violating US laws governing the receipt of classified information. At a news conference on Thursday, Assange criticized the government policies that restricted such communications, but said that Apple had nonetheless been willing to work with representatives of his anti-secrecy organization. Google and Microsoft had simply pointed WikiLeaks to its existing channels for anyone to report a security flaw, he said. Apple denied negotiating with WikiLeaks. “We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms,” the company said. “Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn’t in the public domain. We are tireless defenders of our users’ security and privacy, but we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users,” it said. Although many of the tools targeted outdated versions of the Apple devices’ software, the CIA’s general approach raises new security concerns for the industry, said Eric Ahlm, who studies cybersecurity at research company Gartner. By rewriting the most basic software of a computer or a telephone, tools that operate at the chip level can hide their existence and avoid being wiped out by routine software updates. Under an agreement struck during the administration of former US president Barack Obama, intelligence agencies were supposed to share their knowledge of most security vulnerabilities with tech companies so they could be fixed. The CIA documents suggest that some key vulnerabilities were kept secret for the government’s use. The CIA declined to comment, pointing reporters to its earlier statement about the leaks, in which it defended its use of “innovative, cutting-edge” techniques to protect the nation from foreign threats and criticized WikiLeaks for sharing information that could help the country’s enemies.

The dump, dubbed "Vault 7," contains documents on a number of CIA projects which sought to infect Apple firmware, developed by the CIA's Embedded Development Branch. A fortnight prior to this dump, WikiLeaks published thousands of CIA documents, which detailed attempts to spy on foreign leaders among other shocking revelations. The DarkMatter" set is far more focused, consisting of but 12 documents. RELEASE: CIA #Vault7 "Dark Matter" https://t.co/drdaVhtb53 pic.twitter.com/wZUspTsJ4c — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 23, 2017​ These documents expose the "Sonic Screwdriver" project, a "mechanism for executing code on peripheral devices" while a computer is booting, which would allow CIA attackers to launch hacking software via USB drives and the like even when a firmware password was enabled. "Sonic Screwdriver" was an infector stored on the modified firmware of an Apple Thunderbolt-to-Ethernet adapter. RELEASE: CIA #Vault7 "Dark Matter" https://t.co/pgnfeODXVB pic.twitter.com/vkI16f3vMD — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 23, 2017​ Likewise, "DarkSeaSkies" was an implant consisting of "DarkMatter" "SeaPea" and "NightSkies" —respectively EFI, kernel-space and user-space implants. Also included in this release is the manual for the CIA's "NightSkies 1.2" — a "beacon/loader/implant tool" for iPhone, which allows attackers to retrieve files such as contact lists and call logs, and execute commands. NightSkies had already reached version 1.2 by 2008, and was expressly designed to be physically installed onto box-fresh iPhones. In essence, US intelligence services have been implanting hacking software on yet to be bought iPhones for almost a decade at the time of the documents' release.  © Flickr/ Steve Rhodes Assange Comments on Latest Wikileaks 'Vault-7' Release, 'the Largest Intel Publication in History' Moreover, the documents describe techniques for rewriting devices' firmware in ways that would afford a hacker access even if a user restored a phone or computer to factory settings. A "hard reset" would remove all apps and a device's operating system, installing a clean version — an extreme measure typically employed by users to deal with technical problems, but also a precaution the security-conscious may take when buying a new phone. The CIA has consistently refused to comment on the authenticity of documents released by Wikileaks, with the Agency merely stating it complies with legal prohibitions on electronic surveillance that targets individuals on US soil, and US citizens abroad — this set of exposures is no exception. Matthew Hickey, security expert and founder of Hacker House, said questions remained over how the CIA installed these programs on electronic devices, but potential methods — such as infecting a targeted organization's supply chain, by interdicting mail orders and other shipments leaving the United States or other countries — were "extremely troubling." "The NSA has previously intercepted devices in the mail and manually installing malicious software before they are delivered to companies. This should be a major cause for concern for companies purchasing equipment in bulk from suppliers like Apple," Hickey told Sputnik. This said, Hickey said the documents suggested the CIA targeted devices on an individual level, rather than entire shipment — unlike the methods detailed in Edward Snowden's NSA leaks — the CIA, he noted, are more interested in "personal spying," while the NSA was focused on "corporate attacks." "There's been little research into how "firmware" can be removed, although one tip suggested by these documents is users could move their device's clock forward 180 days, causing the firmware to deinstall itself. Security solutions and scanning tools for detecting the presence of such software are very much in their infancy — at the moment, determining whether your computer or phone is compromized could necessitate physically opening it," Hickey continued.  WikiLeaks' #Vault7 shows that the CIA has developed a huge range of attacks against iPhones since at least 2008.https://t.co/neRkgWFzcA pic.twitter.com/QFnh0WJ3kA — WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 23, 2017​ "Everyone needs to be concerned about this. We need to take a lot more responsibility for our own personal security and understanding, our use of technology and how it can be taken advantage of by the intelligence services. This isn't business meetings being bugged, this is about individual's personal devices being targeted. We need to be vigilant and aware, and engage with cyber security services as part of our daily lives." ...

Published: 20:27 March 24, 2017 Bloomberg   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE BEIJING: Duan Yongping is convinced Tim Cook didn’t have a clue who he was when they first met a couple years ago. The Apple boss probably does now. Duan is the reclusive billionaire who founded Oppo and Vivo, the twin smartphone brands that dealt the world’s largest company a stinging defeat in China last year. Once derided as cheap iPhone knock-offs, they leapfrogged the rankings and shoved Apple Inc. out of the top three in 2016 — when iPhone shipments fell in China for the first time. They managed to do it because the American smartphone giant didn’t adapt to local competition, the entrepreneur told Bloomberg in what he said was his first interview in 10 years. Oppo and Vivo employed tactics Apple was reluctant to match, such as cheaper devices with high-end features, for fear of jeopardising its winning formula elsewhere, Duan said. “Apple couldn’t beat us in China because even they have flaws,” the 56-year-old electronics mogul said. “They’re maybe too stubborn sometimes. They made a lot of great things, like their operating system, but we surpass them in other areas.” That’s not to say Duan doesn’t appreciate the iPhone maker’s global clout. In fact, the billionaire’s obsession with his US rival is legion: he’s long been a big-time investor in Apple and an unabashed fan of its chief executive officer. “I’ve met Tim Cook on several occasions. He might not know me but we’ve chatted a little,” Duan said. “I like him a lot.” Apple couldn’t confirm Duan’s meeting with Cook when contacted by Bloomberg. But Duan has blogged incessantly about Apple’s products, share price and operations since 2013, when the company was worth half what it is today. He needs “a really big pocket” because he carries four devices, including a heavily-used iPhone. In a 2015 post, he argued Apple’s profit should reach $100 billion within five years. Today, Duan won’t say when he actually bought in but says much of his overseas wealth remains tied up in the iPhone maker. He even lives in Palo Alto, an easy drive from Apple’s new UFO-like headquarters in Cupertino. “Apple is an extraordinary company. It is a model for us to learn from,” Duan said. “We don’t have the concept of surpassing anyone, the focus instead is to improve ourselves.” Oppo’s gains against Apple may now earn an even broader following for the billionaire dubbed China’s Warren Buffett by local media for his investment acumen. Born in Jiangxi, a birthplace of Mao Zedong’s Communist revolution, Duan began his career at a state-run vacuum tube plant before making his name with home-grown electronics. Duan left the factory floor around 1990, when China was just embracing capitalism and opening industries to private investment. He headed to southern China’s Guangdong province, then the cradle of liberal reforms, to run a struggling electronics plant. His first product was the “Subor” gaming console with dual-cartridge slots — a direct shot at Nintendo Co.’s classic Family Computer, known elsewhere as the Nintendo Entertainment System. The 100- to 400-yuan Subor became a hit in the absence of local competitors. Duan even enlisted Kung Fu star Jackie Chan to endorse the device. By 1995, revenue from the Subor exceeded 1 billion yuan. Duan left to set up a new business that year as the operation flourished — a pattern he would repeat in later years. He christened his second venture Bubugao, literally “rising higher step-by-step.” BBK, as the company came to be known, created a popular line of VCD and MP3 players but later also made DVD players for global brands. Subsidiary Bubugao Communication Equipment Co. became one of the country’s biggest feature-phone makers around 2000, going head-to-head with Nokia and Motorola. It was the first iPhone in 2007 that paved the way for Oppo and Vivo. While they share a common founder in Duan, the sister brands are fierce competitors, trotting out duelling marketing campaigns in markets from India to Southeast Asia. Their salesmanship philosophy plays well in emerging markets, IDC research manager Kiranjeet Kaur said. “The companies fully understand how to make the best of their people, a speciality they inherited from Duan,” said Nicole Peng, a senior director at Canalys. Importantly, they understood their millennial audience. “Many of their managers are young and have been working at the company since graduation.” Duan’s latest endeavours were, in part, dreamed up in Apple’s backyard. By 2001 at the age of 40, Duan had decided to move to California to focus on investment and philanthropy, later installing his family in a mansion he reportedly bought from Cisco Systems Inc. Chairman John Chambers. But the advent of the smartphone forced the entrepreneur out of retirement. By the second half of 2000s, BBK was on the verge of falling apart as sales of its basic devices slowed. The likes of Huawei and Coolpad were making smartphones priced at around 1,000 yuan. That nearly put the company under, Duan recalled. “We were in serious discussions about how to close the company peacefully — in a way that the employees can leave unhurt and suppliers don’t lose money,” he said. Those intense brainstorming sessions spawned the two businesses that would go on to embody Duan’s greatest success. In 2005, the entrepreneur and his protégé Tony Chen decided to create a new company. Dubbed Oppo, it sold music players but ramped up to smartphones in 2011. In 2009, BBK itself created Vivo, headed by another of Duan’s disciples, Shen Wei. “Making mobile phones was not my call,” said Duan. “But I reckoned we could do well in this market.” At first, neither label garnered much attention. The iPhone was captivating users with its revolutionary apps system and elegant interface, while BlackBerrys lorded over the corporate market. But Oppo and Vivo then developed a marketing-blitz approach that relied on local celebrity endorsement and a vast re-sellers’ store network across China. They crafted an affordable image that appealed to a millennial crowd, then tricked out their devices with high-end specs. On the surface, Oppo and Vivo phones now routinely surpass the iPhone on measures such as charging speeds, memory and battery life. It paid off. The duo together shipped more than 147 million smartphones in China in 2016, dwarfing Huawei Technologies Co.’s 76.6 million units, Apple’s 44.9 million and Xiaomi’s 41.5 million, IDC estimates. Oppo and Vivo both doubled their 2015 haul. In the fourth quarter, they were No. 1 and No. 3, respectively — Huawei was second. Their approach worked particularly well in lower-tier cities, where mid-range phones became a mainstream hit, said Tay Xiaohan, an IDC analyst. Duan’s smartphone progeny are also gaining some momentum beyond their home turf. In the fourth quarter, Oppo and Vivo were fourth and fifth in the world, respectively. About a quarter of Oppo’s shipments went to markets like India, where it hopes to dig in before Apple establishes a meaningful presence. “Smartphones are an unprecedented opportunity. We forecast at least for the next 10 or 20 years, there’s no replacement. But we don’t know,” Duan said. Cook said on the weekend that Apple doesn’t have a specific goal for market share. “The competition is more fierce in China — not only in this industry, but in many industries,” Cook told the China Development Forum in Beijing. “I think that’s a credit to a number of local companies that put their energies into making good products.” Duan has increasingly kept his distance from the Chinese smartphone makers despite remaining a significant shareholder (he won’t say how much). He says he prefers to stay out of the spotlight and enjoy California with his journalist wife and kids. In fact, he attends board meetings but claims to get most of his information on Oppo and Vivo from the internet, to avoid “disturbing them.” His rivals have been less considerate. Last October, Xiaomi Corp. co-founder Li Jun lambasted competitors who build dense store channels in rural areas in pursuit of quick sales. In an interview with China Entrepreneurs Magazine in October, Lei accused such players of using “imbalanced information” to trick buyers into shunning Xiaomi, precipitating its decline from the top spot. “Those who said this were insane,” Duan said without naming names. “When someone talks about an information imbalance, deep down they believe consumers are idiots.” His most visible passion these days is stock investment, which is why he agreed to pay a then-record $620,100 in 2006 to lunch with Buffett. Quotes from the Sage of Omaha still pepper Duan’s blog posts, right alongside tips on golf and Apple. Duan cemented his reputation as a savvy financier in part by digging his friend, Netease Inc. founder William Ding, out of a hole. Ding’s internet company tanked to as low as 13 cents after the dot-com bubble burst, then almost became the first US-listed Chinese company to get tossed off the Nasdaq over an auditing issue. Duan came to his friend’s aid, buying about 5 per cent of Netease with just $2 million in 2002, when the stock price averaged 16 cents. Company filings show he still held just over 4 million shares as of March 2009, but Duan said he sold much of that when Netease hit $40. His other much-studied holding is premium-liquor company Kweichow Moutai Co. He said he bought in at 180 yuan in late 2012. While it nearly halved in 2014, Moutai today trades above 370 yuan. Duan isn’t shy about talking up his trades, not least of which is Apple, which remains near a record high despite a rare sales decline in 2016. But looking back on his decades as first entrepreneur then stock-picker, his proudest moments remain rooted in BBK. Though he claims to keep it at arm’s length, he admits to worrying about succession and whether the company culture will survive another generation of leaders. And while BBK’s Vivo and Duan’s own Oppo have done well, there’s no certainty in a fast-moving business. Both are starting to ramp up everything from the features on their phones to marketing campaigns: Oppo notably used Barcelona’s Mobile World Congress to unveil its most advanced camera technology yet, signalling a new maturity. One thing’s for sure, Duan doesn’t see himself returning to an active executive, leaving others to deal with the next challenge. “I’ve made it clear many years ago, I will never make a comeback,” he said. “If there’s a problem they can’t fix, then neither can I.” More from Technology GE, Mubdala partner to drive manufacturing tech Bundles, discounts the Gitex Shopper drawcards China chipmaker secures $22b to expand globally Beefing up your personal security Will Facebook chat still work on your phone?

Apple says the purported hacking techniques have all been fixed in recent iPhones and Mac computers. (AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato, File) NEW YORK (AP) — Apple said purported hacking vulnerabilities disclosed by WikiLeaks this week have all been fixed in recent iPhones and Mac computers. The documents released by the anti-secrecy site Thursday morning pointed to an apparent CIA program to hack Apple devices using techniques that users couldn't disable by resetting their devices. The iPhone hack was limited to the 3G model from 2008. In a statement late Thursday, Apple said the flaw was fixed with the release of the iPhone 3GS a year later. Apple also said the Mac vulnerabilities were all fixed in all Macs launched after 2013. Apple's statement was consistent with assessments from security experts, who say that many of the apparent vulnerabilities were in older technology. Apple is going further in saying those flaws have all been fixed, based on its preliminary analysis. Security experts say the exploits described in the WikiLeaks documents are plausible, but suggest they pose little threat to typical users. Besides being likely out of date, the techniques also typically require physical access to devices, something the CIA would use only for targeted individuals, not a broader population. The CIA has not commented on the authenticity of this and earlier WikiLeaks revelations, but has previously said it complies with a legal prohibition against electronic surveillance "targeting individuals here at home, including our fellow Americans." The leaks Thursday came about two weeks after WikiLeaks published thousands of alleged CIA documents describing hacking tools it said the government employed to break into computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs from companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. WikiLeaks has offered to share further details with tech companies to help them fix flaws, though accepting such information might subject companies to certain conditions and put government contracts at risk. Apple addressed the offer for the first time in Thursday's statement. "We have not negotiated with WikiLeaks for any information," the statement read. "We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn't in the public domain." Apple said that while it takes users' security and privacy seriously, "we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users." Earlier, Microsoft said WikiLeaks had made initial contact through its public reporting channel, "and we have followed up, treating them as we would any other finder." Mozilla, the organization behind the Firefox web browser, also said it had been contacted through the email address it uses for security vulnerability reporting. Mozilla said it would take steps necessary to fix any vulnerabilities reported that way. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images) By Troy Wolverton | twolverton@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: March 24, 2017 at 9:30 am | UPDATED: March 24, 2017 at 9:51 am When it comes to subscription music services, Spotify and Apple dominate the market. But a third big player in the music industry is about to offer consumers another choice. Pandora, provider of the popular Internet radio service, is rolling out its own on-demand music offering, called Pandora Premium. The company is hoping that by building on its radio service, its new subscription music business will stand out from its rivals. I like the result. Pandora is offering an easy-to-use, very personalized music service. All subscription streaming music services offer users the same proposition. Consumers pay a monthly fee — typically around $10 for an individual listener — to access a universe of music. Subscribers can play any one of millions of songs any time they like and usually can save songs or albums to their devices for offline listening. They can also create playlists or have the service create custom radio stations based on their favorite songs. Related Articles Biz Break: Demand for Pandora Premium could reach beyond listeners Pandora swallows Rdio for $75M Spotify and Apple Music offer those features and so does Pandora Premium, which the company has begun to offer to select users and plans to open up more broadly in coming weeks. Where the services differ is in how they are customized to individual users. Spotify tailors its service to users as it goes along; the more you use the service, the more it knows about your tastes. Apple Music tries to jump start the process by having users, when they sign up, select genres and artists that they like. Pandora, by contrast, is building on what it already knows about its 81 million radio listeners, gleaned from all the songs they’ve listened to, the stations they’ve created and the songs they’ve liked. If you’ve listened to Pandora radio in the past, there’s a good chance that you’ve tapped its “thumbs up” button. That button allows radio listeners to indicate that they like a particular track and would like Pandora to play more songs like it. Now Pandora is using that information for its Premium service to create playlists. Pandora sees playlists as a key way to distinguish its service from its competitors. Right now, creating playlists can be time consuming on both Spotify and Apple Music — users often have to build a playlist by adding songs or albums one by one. Pandora Premium promises to automate this tedious process. Subscribers access Pandora Premium through the same Pandora app they use to get to the company’s radio offering. After signing up for the on-demand service, consumers who have listened to Pandora radio in the past will see a playlist dubbed “My Thumbs Up” prominently displayed. That playlist contains all the songs users have ever given a thumbs-up to while listening to Pandora Radio. So, instead of having to search for particular songs or albums or comb through other people’s playlists, users instantly get access to a collection of songs that Pandora already knows they like. Reading this on your phone? Stay up to date with our new, free mobile app. Get it from the Apple app store or the Google Play store. For some people who have used Pandora Radio for years, that playlist might be unwieldy. I’ve been listening to Pandora for about a decade, so mine consists of 974 songs. And since I’ve created or tuned into multiple stations and liked songs within many of them, those songs don’t all go together very well. But that’s OK, because Pandora has ways to easily create more tailored playlists. If you start listening to one of Pandora’s radio stations and press the thumbs up button a few times, Pandora Premium will automatically offer to create a playlist based on all the songs you’ve given a thumbs up to within that station. If you’ve “liked” a lot of songs in that station in the past, you’ll instantly have a large collection of tracks that likely go together better than those in your “My Thumbs Up” playlist. Alternatively, Pandora will help you create a playlist from an individual song. Spotify and Apple Music give you a similar option. But they generally expect you to add songs to that playlist yourself. By contrast, when Pandora Premium shows you the new playlist you’ve created from that song, it gives you the option to “add similar songs.” Tap on that button, and the service will add another five or so songs to your playlist, typically a combination of tracks from both the same artist and from other artists in the same genre. The feature works a lot like one that Apple used to have built into its iPhone Music app called Genius Playlist that would automatically create playlist based on a single song from the music you had on your phone. With the feature on Pandora, you can manually delete or add songs or keep tapping the “add similar songs” button to fill it out. Company representatives said the feature tailors the selection to each individual user, based on their tastes as indicated by what they’ve listened to and “liked” in the past. So, if two users create a playlist from the same song and then click the “add similar songs” button, they likely will end up with very different playlists. But Pandora is using the data it’s collected about its users to personalize its service in other ways. From the app’s home page, users can choose to “browse” music. From the resulting page, they’ll see a list of new albums Pandora is recommending based on what it knows about their tastes. They’ll also see a list of “recommended artists” that’s personalized to them. And the app will do a cool trick, automatically downloading a selection of songs based on your recent listening history so that you can continue to listen to music when you are offline. Pandora will refresh that download music the next you go back online. Pandora Premium is in its early days and the company is still refining it. So, compared to Spotify and Apple Music, it has some notable shortcomings. For now, unlike those services, you can’t use it on a tablet or on your computer. Instead, it only works on a smartphone or through devices that connect to a smartphone, like Google’s Chromecast or some cars that offer Apple’s CarPlay. Pandora plans to add support for other products — including tablets, computers and some digital set-top boxes — in the near future. Unlike Spotify and Apple Music, Pandora is only offering individual memberships for premium. You can’t yet get a family membership or a student discount, although the company says it will offer both in coming months. Like the other services, there are some songs, like those on Taylor Swift’s “1989” album, that Pandora doesn’t have the rights to stream on demand. But if you happen to own that or similar albums, Pandora, unlike Apple Music, doesn’t offer users a way to upload it to the company’s servers so you can access it from the cloud. Despite those shortcomings, I liked Pandora Premium, particularly its automated playlists. It’s a worthy alternative to streaming music’s giants. Pandora Premium on-demand subscription music service Troy’s rating: 8 out of 10 Likes: Personalized, automated and easy-to-create playlists; tailored song and album recommendations. Dislikes: Only works on smartphones and smartphone connected devices for now; doesn’t yet offer family or student rates; doesn’t offer a way to upload and store personally owned songs.

The sad reality is, most Apple users already suspected this type of activity was taking place, but the new information shows us just how it works. “Dark Matter,” which is the title of the most recent leak, claims that not only has the CIA hacked iPhones, they’ve been doing so since at least 2008, one year after the product was introduced to the market. Wikileaks posted the following statement on their website: ~Today, March 23rd, 2017, WikiLeaks releases Vault 7 “Dark Matter,” which contains documentation for several CIA projects that infect Apple Mac firmware (meaning the infection persists even if the operating system is re-installed) developed by the CIA’s Embedded Development Branch (EDB). These documents explain the techniques used by the CIA to gain ‘persistence’ on Apple Mac devices, including Macs and iPhones, and demonstrate their use of EFI/UEFI and firmware malware. Among others, these documents reveal the “Sonic Screwdriver” project which, as explained by the CIA, is a “mechanism for executing code on peripheral devices while a Mac laptop or desktop is booting” allowing an attacker to boot its attack software, for example, from a USB stick “even when a firmware password is enabled”. The CIA’s “Sonic Screwdriver” infector is stored on the modified firmware of an Apple Thunderbolt-to-Ethernet adapter. ~Also included in this release is the manual for the CIA’s “NightSkies 1.2” [which is] a “beacon/loader/implant tool” for the Apple iPhone. Noteworthy is that NightSkies had reached 1.2 by 2008, and is expressly designed to be physically installed onto factory fresh iPhones, i.e the CIA has been infecting the iPhone supply chain of its targets since at least 2008. NightSkies, according to Wikileaks, was actually operational in 2007, the year that Apple launched the iPhone. In a document describing the NightSkies malware for an iPhone 3G running iOS 2.1, which was the second series release for the phone, the CIA stated that they granted the agency full control over an infected device: “The tool operates in the background providing upload, download and execution capability on the device. NS is installed via physical access to the device and will wait for user activity before beaconing. When user activity is detected, NS will attempt to beacon to a preconfigured LP [listening post] to retrieve tasking, execute the instructions, and reply with the responses in one session.” So basically, as soon as a user activates their phone, it would send a signal to the CIA, giving them access to everywhere you go, everything you say, and everything you do. Considering that over 100 million iPhones are in use in the United States alone, that is a lot of access for the agency to have. MacBooks were also listed as a primary target for the CIA. This time they used an implant called “DarkSeaSkies.” According to the Wikileaks statement: ~”DarkSeaSkies” is “an implant that persists in the EFI firmware of an Apple MacBook Air computer” and consists of “DarkMatter,” “SeaPea” and “NightSkies,” respectively, EFI, kernel-space and user-space implants. ~Documents on the “Triton” MacOSX malware, its infector “Dark Mallet” and its EFI-persistent version “DerStarke” are also included in this release. While the DerStarke1.4 manual released today dates to 2013, other Vault 7 documents show that as of 2016, the CIA continues to rely on and update these systems and is working on the production of DerStarke2.0. Documents also allegedly show that the CIA Embedded Development Branch has been hacking Macs since as far back as 2005. While NightSkies ran on Mac OS X 10.5.2 and above, another rootkit called SeaPea was running on Mac OS X Tiger 10.4, launched 12 years ago. In detailing how a combination of tools, including NightSkies, would work on a Mac, the CIA wrote that it would act as “a beacon/implant that runs in the background of a MacBook Air that provides us with command and control capabilities. The implant will beacon periodically.” Once the MacBook had been compromised following a physical installation, the CIA could access it whenever they wanted. (RELATED: Get more news like this at Censored.news.) Another spy weapon launched by the CIA on Macs was The Sonic Screwdriver Project, carried out in 2012. It would run on the firmware of an Apple Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter and install low-level malware on the Mac from there. It is named after a tool used on the television program “Doctor Who” that opens just about anything. In the same sense, this nefarious project would easily infect other systems, thus opening the door for the CIA to access them as well. Wikileaks is said to be in touch with not only Apple currently, but Google, Microsoft, and other tech companies as well about the leaks. The reason behind this move is so that patches can be created and released to protect users from this type of invasion. Before handing over information, however, Wikileaks has issued a list of demands including promises to fix bugs that allow the spying within 90 days. So far, none of the companies have responded. A spokesperson for the CIA would not comment on the authenticity of the documents, but did provide a brief and insulting statement, vilifying the Wikileaks release: “The American public should be deeply troubled by any Wikileaks disclosure designed to damage the intelligence community’s ability to protect America against terrorists and other adversaries. Such disclosures not only jeopardize U.S. personnel and operations but also equip our adversaries with tools and information to do us harm.” It is still unsettling to hear that companies are using our privacy as currency with government agencies.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « WikiLeaks Reveals CIA's 'DarkMatter' Spyware that had been created for Macs | Main | A Beijing Court Overturns Ruling that the iPhone 6 Design Infringed the Design of a 'Shenzhen Bali' Smartphone » March 24, 2017 Apple invents a Unique Air-Tight Protective Case for Future iPhones with a Smart Communications Component   Yesterday the US Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple that relates to a new kind of smart iPhone case that includes a detection mechanism that notifies the iPhone user with a message on their display when their device is securely in place. If additional steps are required to ensure that the case is securely in place so that the touch sensitive surface of the iPhone is fully functional through the case's added protective layer, the case will provide feedback to your iPhone informing you through a message system what correct measures you must take to correct the alignment problem. The case is made up of two parts to completely encase the iPhone.   We start our report with Apple's patent FIG. 3 noted below which illustrates an exploded view of the iPhone case showing you various features that may be designed to interact with the iPhone or with other features of the case.   The case could use materials such as plastic, silicone and/or leather. The electrical contact #210 may allow the case to communicate with the user's iPhone to provide an indication (in the form of an electronic signal or signals) to i that it's positioned on the surface #212, and in particular, whether the iPhone properly aligned with the second part #206.   In FIG. 3 above, Apple notes that the processor circuit #216 may run a program (or programs) stored on a memory circuit #218 also disposed in the second part #206 below the surface #212.   A battery #220 disposed in the second part and below the surface may provide power to the processor circuit and the memory circuit. If the iPhone is properly aligned, the processor circuit may use the input from the electrical contact and based on the input, generate an output to the iPhone to communicate to the proper alignment to the iPhone.   Conversely, if the iPhone is not properly aligned, corresponding to an "error," the smart case may provide a different output to the iPhone indicating the improper alignment.   In other embodiments, the case will use a detection mechanism #256 which may include a solid-state proximity, Hall Effect or photoelectric sensor that communicates with the power and memory circuits that the case is aligned and closed properly.   In order to provide additional protection to the iPhone, the case may include a sealing element formed from a compressible material, such as silicone.   When the case encloses the iPhone, the sealing element may engage iPhone and in particular, a protective layer (such as a transparent cover glass that overlays the display) of the iPhone.   Further, the sealing element may engage and compress against iPhone to provide an ingress barrier as well as protection against shock when, for example, the electronic device is dropped.   Also, in some embodiments, the iPhone includes a force detection sensor, or force detection layer, designed to sense an amount of force applied to the display. Further, the force detection sensor may also detect an amount of force applied by the aforementioned sealing element to the protective layer. For example, when the first part is assembled with the second part and the sealing element is positioned between the first part and the protective layer, the electronic device may determine whether the sealing element is properly aligned and engaged with the protective layer based upon the force detected by the force detection sensor at the protective layer. The electronic device may compare the detected amount of force with a predetermined amount of force, and generate and present a message on the display indicating whether the sealing element is properly aligned and/or engaged with the electronic device, and in particular, the protective layer. It should be noted that proper alignment/engagement is associated with the detected amount of force being within a tolerance of the predetermined amount of force, or within a predetermined range of force.   The message may include a statement that the sealing element is properly aligned with the protective layer, thereby providing a confirmation to the user that the accessory device needs no further action. Alternatively, the message may include a statement that the sealing element is not properly aligned with the protective layer, and may further suggest a corrective action to the user, which may include instructions to place the sealing element in proper alignment.   Apple's patent FIG. 6 noted above illustrates an isometric view of a rear portion of the accessory device, showing a latch mechanism in an unlocked configuration; FIG. 7 illustrates a plan view of the electronic device positioned in the accessory device, showing the display presenting a message based upon a configuration of the accessory device.   Apple's patent application was filed back in Q3 2016. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

Samsung's upcoming voice-assistant, Bixby, may be hard for some users to say because of the placement of the X.  (LLUIS GENE / AFP/GETTY IMAGES)   By Hayley TsukayamaThe Washington Post Fri., March 24, 2017 If Samsung has its way, we’ll all be bellowing voice commands to “Bixby,” the company’s new voice assistant. Yet Bixby could be hard for some users to call upon because of the placement of one letter: the X. The X in Bixby sounds essentially like a K and an S combined, which is difficult for many people around the world to say, according to linguists, including for those in Samsung’s native South Korea. “Lots of languages do not allow for certain kinds of consonant clusters,” William Idsardi, head of the linguistics department at the University of Maryland, said in an email. Read more: Samsung is taking on Apple’s Siri with its new smartphone, the Galaxy S8 Article Continued Below Samsung hopes AI-enabled Galaxy S8 resuscitates business after Note 7 fiasco The problem, he said, is also exacerbated by the fact that a B comes right after the X, making it a three-consonant cluster (K, S and the B). In languages such as Korean and Japanese, speakers would have to put an extra vowel in between the X and B to make it possible for them to say. That’s something that competitor Amazon’s Alexa manages to avoid, despite having an X in its name. So does Samsung’s Galaxy line. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns the Washington Post.) The company hasn’t released much information on how it chose the name and Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Samsung isn’t alone in naming woes. When Siri came out, Apple took some flak when people noticed the “si” in English becomes a “shi” in Japanese pronunciation — and shiri is the Japanese word for one’s posterior. (It’s more commonly oshiri, but the association sticks.) While it is easy to pile onto Samsung for its linguistic hiccup, the truth is that it’s very difficult to choose a name for anything, said Barbara Kahn, a professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania’s the Wharton School. First, companies must choose a name that isn’t trademarked anywhere else, or at least not in a way that will conflict with their own products. Then, she said, they must conduct an exhaustive test to make sure that the word they choose isn’t associated with anything bad or laughably damaging to the product. Think of the cautionary (though apparently apocryphal) tale of the Chevy Nova, which was said to sell poorly in Spanish-speaking countries because its name sounded like “doesn’t go.” Finally, companies must also choose a word that gives them the opportunity to make their own brand. Even if that word is hard to pronounce, Kahn said, companies can make it their own. She pointed to Aflac, the insurance company which turned its original acronym into a new word, as an example of a company that has embraced the weirdness of its name to great effect. Bixby can also be a good brand for Samsung because it doesn’t have many pre-existing associations with it, said Laurel Sutton, co-founder of the naming firm Catchword, linguist and information officer for the American Name Society. Sutton said that some may remember Incredible Hulk actor Bill Bixby, or know another person with that name, but it’s not a particularly common word. And when it comes to voice assistants, picking an uncommon word is important. Tech firms must choose names that won’t be confused easily with other words, so that the assistant doesn’t trigger by accident. But it also must be a word that is easy for an assistant’s microphone to hear. In that way, Sutton said, Samsung chose a good word. Having a consonant cluster flanked by two vowel sounds, she said, makes Bixby both unique and easy to pick up for a computer. Alexa, she said, also uses this trick. The pattern is also repeated in another trademark, Kestra, that Samsung registered for voice assistants in the U.S. Trademark Office’s public database. Overall, Kahn says that Samsung did a good job picking a name. And, in the end, the name is only part of the equation. If Samsung proves Bixby has value to its customers — however they say it — that’s what will make or break the assistant. “Ultimately, what your brand name means is what consumers think it means,” she said.

As noted by CNBC, Nomura Instinet investor Jeffrey Kvaal has raised his target price for AAPL from $150 to $165 based on the expected iPhone 8 super cycle… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Kvaal predicts that Apple will sell 87 million iPhones during the first quarter of 2018, which begins October 1st of this year and runs through the holiday season. This quarter is generally Apple’s strongest quarter of the year because of the holiday demand and it coincides with the first full quarter of availability for the new iPhone each year. Kvaal’s prediction for sales of 87 million iPhones is higher than Wall Street expectations of 82 million units. Furthermore, the analyst predicts Apple will sell 260 million iPhones in fiscal 2018, again higher than the rest of Wall Street at 239 million. For comparison’s sake, Apple sold 78.3 million iPhones during the Q1 2017, so an increase to 87 million units would be nearly a 12 percent increase year-over-year. In a research note sent to investors, Kvaal attributes the strong iPhone 8 super cycle to pent-up demand for a new model. He explains that Wall Street is “underestimating the upgrade demand” based on the large installed base of older iPhones. Furthermore, Kvaal says that his analysis of trends in the App Store, as well as data from his recent Asia tour, indicates that the iPhone 8 super cycle will be significantly larger than what the rest of Wall Street anticipates. Though Kvaal is incredibly bullish on AAPL and the iPhone 8, he has lowered the stock rating from “strong buy” to “buy.” Analysts have been coming out in waves recently to share a nearly universally bullish opinion on Apple. Recently, analysts at Citi increased their target price for AAPL from $140 to $160 based on iPhone 8 rumors, while Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities issued a note saying that Apple’s new iPhone 8 would significantly impact the supply chain this year. Furthermore, Kate Huberty at Morgan Stanley recently stated that she doesn’t think Wall Street realizes the full potential of the upcoming iPhone 8. Finally, Gene Munster also recently voiced his thoughts on the iPhone 8 causing a “paradigm shift” because of Apple’s lead in augmented reality.

Documents released Thursday pointed to an apparent CIA program to hack Apple devices using techniques that users couldn't disable by resetting their devices. The iPhone hack was limited to the 3G model from 2008. In a statement late Thursday, Apple says the flaw was fixed with the release of the iPhone 3GS a year later. Apple also says the Mac vulnerabilities were all corrected in all Macs launched after 2013. FILE - In this Saturday, June 18, 2016, file photo, customers try out Apple iPhone 6s models on display at an Apple Store in Beijing. New documents from WikiLeaks, posted Thursday, March 23, 2017, point to an apparent CIA program to hack Apple's iPhones and Mac computers such that the exploits persist even after the devices are reset to factory conditions.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein, File) Apple's statement is consistent with assessments from security experts, who say that many of the apparent vulnerabilities were in older technology. Apple is going further in saying those flaws have all been remedied, based on its preliminary analysis. FILE - In this Friday, Sept. 16, 2016, file photo, a customer sets up his new iPhone 7 Plus, right, as he switches from the iPhone 6 at the Apple Store on Michigan Avenue during the release of the Apple iPhone 7 and the latest Apple Watches, in Chicago.

By Leah Yamshon Associate Managing Editor, Macworld | Mar 24, 2017 8:46 AM PT Credit: Apple More like this Every new product Apple just announced: iPad, red iPhone 7, Apple Watch bands,... Apple's bold new red iPhone 7 turns upgrading into a philanthropic decision Apple's new iPad lineup slashes prices, the iPad Air, and iPad mini storage... Video Watch SwapBots spring to life thanks to augmented reality If Apple’s shiny new red iPhone 7 caught your eye on Tuesday when it was first announced, grab your wallet—it’s now officially on sale, as of 8:01 a.m. Pacific/11:01 a.m Eastern on Friday. Also available now is the new 9.7-inch iPad, which replaces the iPad Air 2.  The Product(RED) iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are exactly like the existing iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, just in a new color—an aluminum red backing with a white front bezel—and Apple donates a portion of each Product(RED) device sale to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS. Pick between the 128GB iPhone 7 model for $749 and the 256GB model for $849; the iPhone 7 Plus will set you back $869 or $969, respectively. If you’re enrolled in the iPhone Upgrade Program, the cost of an unlocked red iPhone with AppleCare+ starts at $37 per month. It’s available in Apple stores now, and you can reserve one online for in-store pickup for peace of mind.  Apple As for the latest 9.7-inch iPad, you can order it online today for pickup or delivery next week—Apple’s online store says it will ship on March 31. It comes in 32GB for $329 (which is Apple’s cheapest entry-level, full-sized iPad to date) and 128GB for $429, and you can add cellular connectivity for $130 more. It includes Touch ID, Apple’s A9 processor, and 10 hours of battery life. Pick between silver, gold, or space gray. Oh, and the iPhone SE with an increased storage bump—Apple doubled its storage from 16GB and 64GB to 32GB and 128GB—is also available now, for the same entry-level price (starting at $399). You can find all of these new products on Apple’s website, in Apple stores, and through some certified Apple retailers—our friends at iMore spotted a great deal over at Best Buy that gives you a $25 gift card when purchasing an iPad, and an even better gift card deal if you trade in an older iPad.

Apple told fans that it “can’t wait for you to see it” but to return to the site later. Customers can choose from jet black, black, silver, rose gold and gold in a metallic finish. 5 The new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are on sale now And if you order before 7pm you can expect to receive it by tomorrow, it said on the website.

The new 9.7in iPad is simply called iPad, and is a cheaper, updated version of the iPad Air 2. There will be no iPad Air 3. The new iPad will be available for pre-order right now, and is the cheapest this model has been for some time. by Henry Burrell | 24 Mar 17 Contents When will the new iPad go on sale? How much will the new iPad cost? What colours is new the iPad available in? What are the specs? What new accessories are there for the new iPad? Apple has launched its latest iPad, simply called iPad. The Air branding is no more, but the new product is an updated version of the company's 2014 iPad Air 2. There will be no iPad Air 3. The iPad is what would have been called the iPad Air 3 and comes with Apple's A9 processor, an update to the A8X processor in the iPad Air 2. This means it has the same chip as the iPhone 6s, but retains the same display and cameras as the Air 2. It represents a shift for Apple's marketing strategy around iPads, which have had steadily declining sales of late. By leaving the Air brand behind (the company looks set to do the same for the MacBook too), it is repositioning a high end product as the affordable option for those who don't need the flashier, more expensive but better equipped iPad Pro. Phil Schiller, senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing, said: "iPad is the world's most popular tablet. Customers love the large, 9.7-inch display for everything from watching TV and movies, to surfing the web, making FaceTime calls, and enjoying photos, and now it is even more affordable."  He went on to say: "New customers and anyone looking to upgrade will love this new iPad for use at home, in school, and for work, with its gorgeous Retina display, our powerful A9 chip, and access to the more than 1.3 million apps designed specifically for it." Apple will be hoping that indeed more people with iPads will be tempted to upgrade. The iPad has enjoyed less fruitful global upgrade sales compared to the iPhone. It is not unusual for people to hold on to their iPad model for up to four or five years. Apple promises all day battery life and continuing adaptable Apple SIM support if you plump for the cellular model. Read more: New iPad 2017 review When will the new iPad go on sale? As of Friday 24 March, the new 9.7in iPad is now available to pre-order from Apple. Those that pre-order Apple's cheap tablet should expect it to start ship from the beginning of April, although this may change depending on local stock levels. How much will the new iPad cost? The new 9.7in iPad is attractively priced, starting at £339 for 32GB with Wi-Fi only - £40 cheaper than what the iPad Air 2 was selling for until the announcement. A 128GB version is also available for £429, in addition to a 32GB cellular version at £469 and a 128GB cellular version at £559. What colours is new the iPad available in? The new 9.7in iPad will come in silver, gold or space grey - no rose gold to be seen, a colour reserved for the iPad Pro. What are the specs? Processor The new iPad retains the excellent display of the iPad Air 2, with a resolution of 2048 x 1536 (264ppi). It will look serious good, and will run all the smoother and faster with Apple's excellent A9 chip and M9 coprocessor. Dimensions and weight It measures 240 x 169.5 x 7.5mm and weighs a shoulder-pleasing 469g. Ports, buttons and slots Everything that we saw on the iPad Air 2 is also present, with Touch ID home button, Lightning connector, stereo speakers, 3.5mm headphone jack (hooray!) power/wake button, volume controls and a SIM tray on the cellular versions.  Cameras The rear facing 8Mp camera is the same as on the Air 2, with features such as autofocus, panorana, HDR (not for video) and a f/2.4 aperture. It's also capable of 1080p HD video recording at 30fps and slo-mo recording at 120fps.  The front facing camera is a FaceTime HD lens with 1.2Mp and a f/2.2 aperture, capable of 720p HD video recording. So, excellent for a tablet, basically.  What new accessories are there for the new iPad? There are a set of new Smart Covers for the new 9.7in iPad available here from Apple, including a new (PRODUCT)RED cover to match the also new red iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.  If you're more looking for information on other models in the current iPad range, read our reviews of the 12.9in iPad Pro, 9.7in iPad Pro and iPad Air 2, and of the iPad mini 4 and iPad mini 2.

After a hacker or group of hackers threatened to remotely wipe data from millions of iPhones including photos, videos and messages, Apple has denied any such breach into iPhones. The hackers, who call themselves 'Turkish Crime Family', asked for $75,000 in Bitcoin or Ethereum (a form of crypto-currency) or $100,000 worth of iTunes gift cards in exchange for deleting a large cache of iCloud and other Apple email accounts, Vice blog Motherboard reported. Reacting to the threat, Apple told Fortune on Wednesday: "There have not been any breaches in any of Apple's systems including iCloud and Apple ID. The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services." The hackers claim to have access to nearly 559 million Apple email and iCloud accounts. The hackers provided screenshots of alleged emails between the group and members of Apple's security team and threatened to reset iCloud accounts and remotely wipe victim's Apple devices on April 7 unless Apple pay them. The Apple spokesperson, however, said that Apple is "actively monitoring to prevent unauthorised access to user accounts and are working with law enforcement to identify the criminals involved." According to reports, several email accounts and passwords may belong to an earlier breach at the professional networking site LinkedIn in 2012. However, Apple customers who secure their iCloud accounts with the same passwords they use with other online accounts must go for new, strong passwords, the report added.

CBS News Logo CBS News News Latest US World Politics Entertainment Health MoneyWatch SciTech Crime Sports Shows Video More In Depth Photos Mobile Radio Local Shop Log in/out Search CBSN Toggle video By Laura Hautala CNET March 24, 2017, 11:34 AM WikiLeaks: CIA tools could infiltrate MacBooks, iPhones A new series of leaked documents appears to show tools from as far back as 2009 that could infect Apple products. Sean Gallup, Getty Images Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Armed with a fresh set of leaked documents, WikiLeaks said Thursday that the US Central Intelligence Agency has developed tools to infect Apple products like iPhones and MacBooks. The tools, which date from between 2009 and 2013, are unlikely to affect current Apple hardware. They show a spy agency attempting to crack into some of the most locked-down consumer electronics devices available, using hacking methods that require the agency to directly access the products. CNET is unable to verify whether the documents are real or have been altered. In a press release, WikiLeaks said it’s “likely” the CIA accessed Apple products and infected them “by interdicting mail orders and other shipments (opening, infecting, and resending) leaving the United States or otherwise.” The CIA responded by reiterating a statement from earlier in March, declining to comment on the authenticity of the documents. In that earlier incident, WikiLeaks issued leaked documents revealing a cache of hacking tools that targeted the operating systems of popular phones and PCs, as well as a hacking tool for a Samsung SmartTV that required physical access. “It is CIA’s job to be innovative, cutting-edge, and the first line of defense in protecting this country from enemies abroad,” the agency said. “America deserves nothing less.” Apple said late Thursday that the iPhone vulnerability affected only the 3G asn was plugged in 2009 with the release of of the 3GS. Meanwhile, the Mac vulnerability was fixed in all Macs released after 2013. Play Video CBSN WikiLeaks' Julian Assange addresses CIA hack WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is saying "devastating incompetence" led to the CIA leaks. He also says WikiLeaks will work with tech companies ... “We have not negotiated with Wikileaks for any information,” Apple said in a statement. “We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn’t in the public domain.” The tools target Apple’s firmware, which is software that permanently runs on electronics to run fundamental processes. One tool revealed on Thursday, dubbed “Sonic Screwdriver” in the alleged CIA documents, could infect MacBook firmware through the Thunderbolt port. The approach takes advantage of a flaw similar to a problem described by security researcher Trammell Hudson in 2015. They developed a hacking tool they dubbed “Thunderstrike 2” that infected MacBook firmware through the Thunderbolt port based on the flaw, which Apple patched in 2015. Another tool described in the cache sought to infect iPhones as early as 2008, WikiLeaks said in its press release. The tool had been developed to version “1.2,” the organization noted, suggesting that “the CIA has been infecting the iPhone supply chain of its targets since at least 2008.” Regarding the tools revealed by WikiLeaks on Thursday, Hudson wrote on his blog that, “they are all fairly old and probably don’t reflect the state of the art for the CIA Operations Group.” This article originally appeared on CNET.com. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc..

This claim was made in an investment note by RBC analyst Amit Daryanani, seen by Business Insider …  Anker braided Lightning cables The note included the above chart, showing the amount of money Apple has so far allocated to – and spent on – stock buybacks between March 2013 and the end of last year. The note also calculates that Apple has spent an average of $2.9B per quarter on dividend payouts since 2012, with Daryanani suggesting that Apple may announce an increase to its capital allocation program in its next earnings call. One big unknown is whether or not Apple would be able to repatriate any of its overseas cash without losing much of it to tax. Most of the company’s $246B cash reserves are currently held outside the US. President Trump has promised to enable companies like Apple to bring home cash from overseas subsidiaries while paying just 10% tax on it rather than 35%, but he has yet to put forward any concrete proposals. Apple is currently in the ironic position of sitting on large piles of cash while simultaneously borrowing money on the bond markets to fund its stock buybacks and dividend payments. The low rates of interest it is able to offer make this arrangement worthwhile, with the additional benefit of saving dividend payments on all the stock it purchases.

You are here: Blog Share 24 March, 2017 All the digital news stories you missed this week By Ben Davis @ Econsultancy 0 comments Lots of exciting glimpses into the future in this week's tech roundup. New tools for marketers, new user experiences in banking, hope for augmented reality, and even a special smartphone pocket in your jeans (whoever could've imagined it?). Apple Clips could help marketers with captioned video Apple this week announced that Clips will be coming soon. The tool creates videos for sharing on other platforms and includes overlays, emojis, music that is automatically adjusted to the video length and facial recognition to identify people in your videos. But the most useful feature may be the animated captions (voice to text) that are created as you record. This feature synchronises the text to the cadence of your voice and, as Wired suggests, may be 'a neat solution to an ironic—and increasingly irksome—problem: The more people use video to communicate, the more they need text to tell them just what those videos are saying.' Wells Fargo lets customers use ATMs with their smartphones Wells Fargo will allow customers to withdraw cash from ATMs using only their smartphones and no bank card, after a trial earlier this year. From Monday, the bank will upgrade all 13,000 of its cash machines in the US, with customers then able to use their pin and a code generated from the Wells Fargo mobile app. Reuters reports that both Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase are developing similar tech. Airbnb rebrands in China (but does the name translate?) Airbnb in China has become Aibiying 爱彼迎 , which translates as ‘welcome each other with love’, and will double investment in operations in the country, including tripling its workforce and launching a big marketing campaign. As far as the new name goes, AdAge reports 'there was a backlash on social media, with critics saying the new name is hard to pronounce and doesn't make sense. Among the nastier commentary, one said the name sounded like a "copycat porn company." (The second character of the name sounds similar to slang for a female anatomy part.)' Though Airbnb has 80,000 listings in China, competitor Tujia has more than 400,000. Airbnb is hoping to close the gap by appealing to the 80% of its Chinese users that are aged under 35. Samsung launches personal assistant, Bixby Bixby is different from other assistants in that it is designed to help you perform tasks within apps on the new Galaxy S8, expected to be announced later this month. Samsung says it "will understand the current context and state of the application and will allow users to carry out the current work-in-progress continuously.” As The Verge puts it, "a less charitable interpretation might be that Bixby exists to solve one of the most difficult challenges in all of tech: make Samsung’s own poorly designed software and interfaces easier to use." Bixby will initially be limited to a handful of preinstalled apps, and will be available in English or Korean.  Muji's sixth pocket In massive news, The Verge has noticed that Muji sells trousers with an innovative sixth pocket for the smartphone. Apple bets on augmented reality? Bloomberg reports that Apple is set to add AR features to the iPhone and, further down the line, launch a pair of smart glasses in an attempt to gain a competitive advantage over other smartphones and create another Apple USP. Anonymous sources suggest Apple has acquired several small businesses with expertise in this area and has built a team including talented outsiders who have worked on Oculus and HoloLens, as well as digital-effects specialists from Hollywood. US companies join UK in pulling out of Google spending The Google advertising row has hit the headlines again this week. AT&T and Verizon have joined many UK brands in freezing ads on YouTube, in the continued wake of The Times' revelations about brand content appearing alongside extremist videos. At Advertising Week Europe on Tuesday, Google's European head Matt Brittin apologised and discussed updates to policies. The day before, Philipp Schindler, Google’s chief business officer, detailed expanded safeguards such as tighter default controls that will exclude a wider range of content including fake channels and offensive material. For a cogent roundup of the ongoing fiasco, read Lara O'Reilly's roundup on Business Insider. The major points are this: More than 250 brands have suspended their campaigns from YouTube. Google is tackling the problem with people, tech and policy updates. It may be suggested that opportunist agencies are piling on pressure, with a view to negotiating better rates or to bring the DoubleClick wall down. It's a relatively small problem that has blown up because CEOs can easily understand the issue (unlike complex transparency issues that are ongoing). The scandal is taking the heat off agencies embroiled in non-transparent practices (e.g. arbitrage and rebates). Andrew Ng resigns from Baidu Andrew Ng, previously founding lead of Google Brain, has resigned from his position at Baidu. Since he joined in 2014, Baidu’s AI group has grown to 1,300 people supporting search, advertising, maps, take-out delivery, voice search, security, consumer finance and more. New products have included autonomous cars, a conversational computing platform, face recognition and an AI-powered chatbot for healthcare. Ng leaves to look for a future project that can take AI to the wider world (outside of tech) and notes in a blog post on Medium that 'Baidu is now one of the few companies with world-class expertise in every major AI area: speech, NLP, computer vision, machine learning, knowledge graph.' LinkedIn launches trending stories Another feed for you to scroll through - see the video below. Uber’s president quits after seven months Jeff Jones explained that the “beliefs and approach to leadership that have guided my career are inconsistent with what I saw and experienced at Uber.” Uber has seen several high profile departures recently, with Travis Kalanick now looking for a COO to help get a hold of things. Instagram advertisers number 1m Instagram says it has 1m advertisers (mostly small businesses) on its platform and has announced the forthcoming integration of a booking function in the app.  Advertisers have grown in number rapidly since last year, when Instagram cited 200,000 advertisers. In other news, Instagram is to use its moderation team to begin blurring 'sensitive' content reported by other users.

 Apple's new red iPhone is available to buy now Rob Price, Business Insider UK Mar. 24, 2017, 11:02 AM 1,997 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple Sound the alarm: You can now buy a red iPhone. The special edition smartphone from Apple went on sale on Apple's website on Friday. It was announced earlier this week, along with a new cheap iPad, a new Snapchat-esque photo-editing app, new iPhone cases, and more. The device is part of Apple's long-running partnership of with the (RED) organisation, with money from each sale going towards HIV/AIDS research and relief efforts. Apart from the red lick of paint, it's just a regular iPhone 7 or 7 Plus. But the cheapest 64GB version isn't for sale in the special colour — only the 128GB or 256GB models are available.  It costs $749 (£699) for the 128 GB model iPhone 7, and $849 (£799) for the 256 GB version. For the red iPhone 7 Plus, the 128 GB version is $859 (£819), while the 256 GB one goes for $969 (£919).  The Apple Store website currently says US deliveries should ship in one business day, while in the UK deliveries are estimated for March 28. The red iPhone is the most interesting-looking phone that Apple has built in a long time — a welcome relief from the gold-and-grey monotony that plagues many modern smartphones. It has a matte metal red back and silver Apple logo, along with a white front-plate.  It's expected to sell particularly well in China, where the colour red is considered lucky. But on the Chinese mainland, Apple's website makes no mention of the (RED) branding.

Your Wish List is accessible in App Store on mobile and iTunes on desktop. As the feature’s title suggests, you can add iPhone, iPad and iPod touch apps and games to your Wish List that you might want to explore or purchase later. With this tutorial, you’ll learn how to add, remove and downloads items on your Wish List on your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac or PC devices. You can add apps to your Wish List to buy later via App Store on mobile, iTunes on desktop or your history. Apps on your Wish List can be sent as gifts to other people, removed from the list and more. What is Wish List and why use it? As mentioned, Wish List is built into iTunes and App Stores. Wish List syncs across your devices. Changes made to the items on your Wish List on one device are reflected on other devices signed in to the same App Store account, and vice versa. Wish List makes it practical to add apps and games you’d like to explore, purchase or gift later. Unfortunately, you cannot add free apps to Wish List. Even with these limitations, Wish List is a much better solution than manually sending app URLs to Notes via App Store’s Share menu. Use your app Wish List to: Bookmark apps you might want to explore later Track apps you’d like to purchase later Gift apps on your Wish List to friends, family or other people Wish List contents is synced automatically across devices as long as you’re signed in to iTunes or App Store with the same Apple ID on all your devices. You can access your Wish List on: Mobile—App Store on iOS devices Desktop—iTunes for Mac or Windows PCs NOTE: Wish List is currently unsupported in Mac App Store. In iBooks for iOS, Wish List only shows audiobooks. iBooks for Mac does not support Wish List. How to add iOS apps to Wish List You can add iOS apps to your Wish List from three places: App Store, iTunes and your history. Here’s how you add apps to your Wish List. iPhone, iPad and iPod touch: 1) Open App Store and view the app you might want to add to your Wish List. 2) Tap the Share button in the top-right corner. 3) Tap Add to Wish List in the Share menu. The app is instantly added to your Wish List. NOTE: This option is unavailable for free apps or apps you already purchased. You aren’t charged for the app unless you purchase it. Mac and Windows: 1) Open iTunes, click the More Options (…) icon in the top-left part of the window, then choose Apps from the menu. 2) At the top of the screen, click App Store. 3) When you find an app that you’d like to add to your Wish List, click the arrow next to the Buy button menu under the app icon, then choose Add to Wish List from the menu. The app is instantly added to your Wish List. How to view iOS apps on Wish List You can view apps on your Wish List in App Store and desktop iTunes. iPhone, iPad and iPod touch: 1) Open App Store and tap the Wish List button. HINT: It looks like three horizontal bulleted lines, found in the top-right corner. NOTE: Your Wish List is inaccessible via the Search and Updates tabs. You’re presented with a list of iOS apps you added to your Wish List. HINT: You can explore your Wish List in landscape mode, too. 2) Tap Done to close your Wish List. Mac or Windows: 1) Open iTunes and choose Wish List from the Account menu. NOTE: Before you can view, add or remove apps on your Wish List, be sure that you’re signed in to iTunes with your Apple ID. 2) Wish List defaults to the Music tab. Click the Apps tab in the top-right section. Up pops a list of apps on your Wish List. Accessing a history of app previews you watched in App Store Since November 2013, App Store has allowed developers to embed a video preview alongside static screenshots for their apps. A history of app trailers you watched in App Store or iTunes is available to you as part of your Wish List—but only on desktop, not mobile. Here’s how to see a history of iOS app trailers you watched. Mac or Windows: 2) Choose Wish List from the Account menu and click the Apps tab in the top-right. A list of recently watched app trailers appears in the column headlined Previews. HINT: To wipe the list clean, click Clear All in the top-right corner of column heading. Confirm the operation by clicking the Clear History button in the dialog. The list of app trailers you recently watched is cleared out. How to remove iOS apps from Wish List You can remove apps individually or in bulk from Wish List at any time. iPhone, iPad and iPod touch: 1) Open App Store and tap the Wish List button. NOTE: Your Wish List is inaccessible via the Search and Updates tabs. 2) Find the app you want to remove, then swipe left and tap Delete. HINT: You can remove multiple apps at once. Tap Edit in the top-left corner and tap the apps you want to remove. In the top-right corner, tap Delete to finish. 3) Tap Done to close your Wish List. Mac or Windows: 1) Open iTunes and choose Wish List from the Account menu. 2) Click the Apps tab in the top-right section. 3) Click “x” in the top-left corner of the app you wish to remove from your Wish List. The app is instantly removed from the list. How to buy or gift iOS apps on Wish List If you want to purchase one or more apps for yourself or buy an app as a gift for a friend, you can do just that in a few easy steps. iPhone, iPad and iPod touch: 1) Open App Store and tap the Wish List button. HINT: Your Wish List is inaccessible via the Search and Updates tabs. 2) To the right of the app that you want to buy, tap the price, then tap the Buy button. You may be prompted to enter your Apple ID password or use Touch ID to complete the purchase. 3) Tap Done to close your Wish List. Mac or Windows: 1) Open iTunes and choose Wish List from the Account menu. 2) Click the Apps tab in the top-right section. 3) Under the icon of the app you want to buy or gift, do either: Gift This App— To give an app as a gift to someone, click the arrow to the right of the price and choose Gift This App . You’ll go through the gifting process. Buy This App— Click the price and select Buy to confirm your purchase. If asked, enter your password. The app then downloads. Wish List on iTunes Store Aside from Wish List acting as a bookmarking feature for apps, iTunes Store has its own Wish List that supports other purchasable media. For example, you could keep stuff like movies, TV shows, books and other paid items on your iTunes Store Wish List to keep an eye on or perhaps buy later. Wish List on iTunes Store supports music, movies, TV shows and more. Wish List on iTunes Store also keeps a history of the songs you’ve previewed, listened to on Apple Music Radio or asked Siri to identify. Wish List on iTunes Store is divided into three sections: Wish List—This is where any songs, albums, music videos, alert tones, movies, TV show seasons/episodes, books and audiobooks you’ve added to your Wish List appear. Siri—Songs you’ve asked Siri to identify go here. Previews—This is your history of songs, movies, TV show episodes, books and audiobooks that you’ve previewed. Your Apple Music, Beats 1 and other Apple Music Radio play history is available separately in the Music app on iOS and iTunes on desktop. Wish List on Apple TV Wish List is also supported in the Movies app on Apple TV but it sync only with other Apple TVs. Wish List on Apple TV is only supported in the Movies app. As mentioned, Wish List is not supported in Mac App Store. Books added to your Wish Lists appear only in iTunes on desktop, not in your iTunes Store Wish List on iOS devices. We’re not sure why Apple doesn’t allow this considering books are part of iTunes Store. Do you use Wish List? Do you use Wish Lists at all? If so, what do you use it for beyond keeping track of the items you’d like to buy at a later stage? Have you ever used Wish List to find a song Siri has identified? If you’ve never used Wish List before, we’d like you to give it a try because it’s one of those little features you don’t know you need until you’ve used it. Feel free to pass this article along to your friends and family who may be unaware of Wish Lists on their Apple devices.

Wells Fargo to add NFC mobile withdrawals to ATMs later this year   Explore: Apple Ford Microsoft Starbucks Tencent   Starbucks to add gift cards to iMessage as Mobile Order & Pay grows By Rian Boden • nfcworld.com • Published 24 March 2017, 15:03 • Last updated 24 March 2017, 15:03 ON ME: Users can send each other Starbucks gift cards in Apple’s messaging app from April Starbucks customers across the US will soon be able to purchase gift cards using Apple Pay and send them to friends and family within Apple’s iMessage platform. The move comes as the coffee giant reveals it now has approximately nine million mobile paying customers with one in three using Mobile Order & Pay, which accounted for 8% of all transactions made across US stores last month. More than 1.2m gift cards have been sent and redeemed through Chinese internet giant Tencent’s WeChat Pay mobile payments platform in Starbucks China stores since the service launched there in December 2016, the company also revealed during its annual shareholders’ meeting earlier this week. Ford drivers will also be able to order coffee through their Ford Sync 3 in-car system later this year by speaking commands to Amazon’s virtual assistant Alexa, Starbucks revealed, and its MyStarbucks artificial intelligence-powered assistant is now also available to more than 100,000 customers across the US, with plans to roll out the feature nationwide by the end of the year. “Starbucks continues to offer the largest and most robust mobile ecosystem of any retailer in the world, with over 13m Starbucks Rewards members, approximately 9m mobile paying customers — with one out of three now using Mobile Order & Pay — and more than $6bn loaded onto prepaid Starbucks cards in North America during 2016 alone,” the chain says. A presentation given at the meeting by Starbucks’ Gerri Martin-Flickinger outlined the company’s digital innovation: “Over the years, giving and receiving Starbucks gift cards has become iconic,” Martin-Flickinger tells shareholders. “Traditionally, our customers have purchased gift cards from our stores and other retailers and now customers can also purchase them digitally in our Mobile Order & Pay app or website. “Earlier this year, we released an add-in for Microsoft Outlook 365, which many consumers and businesses use for email. The add-in allows you to give someone a Starbucks gift card without ever leaving your email session, with just a few clicks. “This spring, we’ll release Starbucks gifting for iMessage. This will allow our customers to give a Starbucks Gift Card within an iMessage conversation on an iPhone or an iPad. In this example, two co-workers are messaging one another. “One coworker wants to thank his colleague for a job well done. Without leaving the iMessage conversation, he’s able to select a gift card and pay with Apple Pay with just a few taps. The recipient can redeem the gift card right from their iPhone using Apple Pay. This will be released in April — and that’s just the beginning. “We’ve many more social gifting solutions coming all with the intent of making gift giving and receiving even easier for our customers — we’re driving towards these types of solutions all around the world.” “Our highest volume Mobile Order & Pay stores are seeing more than 20% of their transactions through Mobile Order & Pay at peak,” Martin-Flickinger adds. “With this volume, we recognise the need to continue to streamline and enhance the in-store experience.” Starbucks talks about its Mobile Order & Pay service and how it plans to use technologies such as artificial intelligence to enhance the chain’s digital offering in a Q&A which forms part of NFC World’s What’s New in Payments report.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox News Tech Expand/Collapse Search Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Business Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World On Air Tech Home Computers Google Video Games Military Tech War Games Slideshows Apple New iPhone, iPad roundup: everything Apple announced this week By Brooke Crothers Published March 24, 2017 FoxNews.com Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print If you like the color red and cheaper iPads, Apple made several announcements this week worth noting. The red iPhone – Apple’s first with this color – announcement was probably the highest profile but the least significant of the announcements, while the prices for the new iPad and iPad Mini deliver something rare for Apple – value and low price. iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition The special-edition iPhones are red on the back and side but have a white face. They're only available in 128GB and 256GB storage options, starting at $749 for the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and $869 for the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus. APPLE SAYS CIA'S ARSENAL OF IPHONE AND MAC EXPLOITS IS OUTDATED A less-expensive 32GB model is not available. With the new iPhones, there are no new features. They are exactly the same as the iPhones announced last September. So, if you’re waiting for a redesigned iPhone, that probably won’t happen until later this year (likely the fall time frame), when Apple is expected to announce a 10th Anniversary iPhone that is packed with new hardware and software. iPhone SE The 4-inch iPhone is now available in 32GB and 128GB models, doubling the current capacity and replacing 16GB and 64GB models at the same starting price of $399. 2017 iPad If you’re in the market for a new iPad, this is one of the better deals Apple has ever offered. For $329, you get a Wi-Fi 9.7-inch iPad with a high-resolution Retina Display and 32GB of storage, which is  enough for most consumers using cloud-based storage. The 32GB Wi-Fi + Cellular model goes for $459. The 2017 iPad also includes newer internal hardware such as an A9 processor (a generation ahead of the iPad Air 2’s A8 chip) and 2GB of RAM, according to a comparison chart done by AppleInsider. APPLE DENIED THE MASSIVE ICLOUD HACK (BUT YOU SHOULD STILL CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD) The 2017 iPad also sports a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, 10 hours of battery life (according to Apple) and a weights one pound. The new iPad is a “realignment of the product family to better position it for a global customer base,” Rhoda Alexander, an analyst at IHS Markit, told Fox News. 128GB iPad Mini 4 Another good deal is the iPad mini 4, as the 128GB Wi-Fi version received a price cut to $399. The upshot is, you’re getting 128GB of storage for the same price as the previous 32GB configuration. The price is $529 for the 128GB Wi-Fi + Cellular model. The Mini 4 has a 7.9-inch Retina display, Touch ID sensor, and an A8 processor. The new pricing and increased memory for the same price, opens up “lots of new opportunities” as Apple tries to target more consumers beyond its traditional pricey, high-end devices, IHS’ Alexander said. APPLE DESIGNED AN IPHONE-POWERED LAPTOP Future iPads Apple is still expected to announce a redesign of the iPad in the form of a 10.5-inch version, according Alexander, which she expects later this year. “Indications are the actual 10.5-inch iPad production is commencing in this month,” she told Fox News. It's currently unclear when Apple would actually announce the product.  Advertisement TRENDING IN TECH 1 US Army set for new lightweight combat helmet 2 Tennessee couple tried selling baby on Craigslist, investigators say 3 UK battles counterfeiters, launches ‘most secure coin in the world’ 4 Scientists see evidence of an ancient tsunami on Mars 5 Indiana inmates could receive tablets as part of bold tech program See all Trends Scitech Connect Subscribe to the daily Geek Sheet for the top science and technology stories.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Apple patent shows iPhone or iPad docking system to Macbook A new patent from Apple published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) describes a way by which you can dock your iPhone into the MacBook-like shell and power it using the smartphone. Titled as Electronic accessory device, the patent application was first discovered by Apple Insider. The patent comes with two different illustrations for how the technology would work for phones and tablets. In case of phones, there will be a slot on the accessory device instead of a trackpad while tablets will be docked into the space where a laptop’s screen is normally present. While the laptop still provides the screen, keyboard, GPU and ports, the iPhone will only act as the trackpad but also used to drive the whole unit. In both cases, it would mean the device would be running iOS rather than MacOS. HP Elite X3 currently offers this functionality which connects the phone to a laptop-style dock using Windows 10 Mobile’s Continuum. It must be noted that this is just a patent application and it does not mean that Apple will turn this into a reality.

(Investor's Business Daily) Analyst downgrades are never good news for shareholders, but some are worse than others. Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) just got the kind of downgrade that all shareholders are hoping for. With shares up 22 percent in 2017, Needham analyst Laura Martin downgraded Apple's stock from Strong Buy to Buy, as the stock has now risen to within 6 percent of the firm’s previous $150 price target. Along with the downgrade, Needham set a new target of $165. Related Link: Snap's Fortunes May Be Tied To Apple And Vodaphone Martin uses the acronym RAPID to explain the five reasons why Apple remains a top stock pick for Needham: Recurring revenue streams Arms dealer in a rising tide Pure play on secular mobile growth market Inexpensive based on relative margins, asset efficiency and stock valuation Downside protection due to excess cash, dividends and share repurchases The arms dealer analogy refers to Apple’s App Store. “AAPL takes 15-30% of any revenue from every app on their devices and is immune to customer fatigue tied to any single app,” Martin explains. From a valuation perspective, Martin concludes Apple is much more profitable on a per-share basis than content companies like Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) and CBS Corporation (NYSE: CBS) and more asset-efficient than internet companies Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) and Expedia Inc (NASDAQ: EXPE). Apple's 22 percent year-to-date gain makes it the top-performing stock among the Dow Jones Industrials by about 8 percent.

An analyst claims there's an "antifragile monopoly." But the view is incomplete. Brian Stoffel (TMFCheesehead) Mar 24, 2017 at 10:05AM Earlier this month, an analyst for UBS made waves publishing a note about Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Steve Milunovich asked: "Is Apple an anti-fragile monopoly?" He answers his own question, stating, "One characteristic of monopolies is pricing power. iPhone's ASP [average selling price] of almost $700 last quarter ... could further rise with the iPhone 8." That note set off a wave of follow-up articles across the investing blogosphere about the anti-fragility of Apple. But what does "antifragile" mean, and why are so many investors making a fuss about it? Image source: Getty Images Antifragility: An introduction Many people don't know what antifragile means, but it's a concept that I'm very familiar with. Indeed, it is the basis by which I make all of my investment decisions. Antifragity is the product of thinker, trader, and author of Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder Nassim Taleb. He sees everything in the world as being classified in one of three ways: fragile, robust, and antifragile. While the first two are well-known concepts to most readers, the latter is new. Here's an easy way to think about it:   Fragile Robust Antifragile When stress is applied, it... Breaks Stays the same Gets stronger Example from real life A teacup falling from a table A piece of iron Human muscles after lifting a heavy weight What it likes A predictable sequence of events Doesn't care Small and non-fatal mistakes to learn from Taleb uses the mythical Hydra -- pictured above -- as the ideal exemplar. If you cut the head off the beast, two more grow in its place. Indeed, it needs stress to grow stronger. Sit back and ponder this classification long enough and you'll see the human body is the ultimate antifragile machine. If you don't apply acute stress intermittently, your body becomes weaker. That's why astronauts lose bone density: The lack of stress from the force of gravity weakens the bones. It's important to note that there's a limit to antifragility. Apply too much stress -- or medium-level stress over a long enough time frame -- and something becomes fragile. They key here is that stressors are acute, not chronic, and there's time to rest and process after the stressors take place. But what does this have to do with investing? I've broken it down to three critical variables. The barbell approach To become antifragile, Taleb suggests a barbell approach, which gives a visual. For our purposes, what this means is that a company should spend 85% of its time and effort securing safe and reliable income, while spending 15% of its time on high-risk, high-reward ventures. I have come to view the "safe and reliable" as the company's moat, and "high-risk, high-reward" as optionality -- or the ability to test new ideas with limited downside but unlimited upside. Author's formatting using images from Getty Images. Apple's moat is composed of two parts: brand and high switching costs. As far as brand strength goes, Apple is second only to Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), according to Brand Finance, which says Apple's brand is worth $107 billion. That helps explain the phenomenon that Milunovich noted: Customers are willing to pay a premium for Apple products. It should be noted, however, that this $107 billion represents a contraction of 26% over just one year. Brand Finance noted, "Apple has failed to maintain its technological advantage and has repeatedly disillusioned its advocates with tweaks when material changes were expected."  That's where the weakness in Apple's moat shines through. The iPhone accounted for 63% of all sales last fiscal year. That's a heavy concentration in one area and represents the potential for fragility should the brand deteriorate. The company's history shows continual development of new products: first the iPod, then the iPhone, followed by the iMac. All the while, Apple was developing the iTunes store and the iCloud. The iCloud has been paramount for ensuring that there are switching costs associated with abandoning Apple's ecosystem. The switching costs, however, are far from insurmountable. Image credit: Apple And since the death of Steve Jobs, we've seen scant evidence of real optionality. While rumors have surfaced about Apple's move into cars, artificial intelligence, or other venues, the only real new product we've seen is the Apple Watch -- which hasn't demonstrably moved the company's long-term profit needle. Perhaps most alarming was the company's change in mission statements under CEO Tim Cook. Under Jobs, Apple's mission was "To make a contribution to the world by making tools for the mind that advance humankind." That's a powerful mission that opens itself up for tons of optionality; there's no telling where "advancing humankind" can take you. But the current version is a manifestation of business-speak that has almost no enduring meaning. It reads: Apple designs Macs, the best personal computers in the world, along with OS X, iLife, iWork, and professional software. Apple leads the digital music revolution with its iPods and iTunes online store. Apple has reinvented the mobile phone with its revolutionary iPhone and App store, and is defining the future of mobile media and computing devices with iPad.   This is just plain awful. It gives me little confidence that the company will continue innovating the way it once did. The brand is strong, but switching costs are weak, and it's tough to find evidence of real optionality under Cook. Grade for Barbell Strategy = B- Skin in the game During antiquity, Taleb points out, managing risk was dealt with by ensuring that decision-makers had their skin in the game. The engineer who designed and built a bridge was forced to live underneath his bridge. It's a simple solution to a very complex problem of hidden or unknowable risk. With Apple, there's very little skin in the game. Management altogether owns less than 1% of shares outstanding. While I can't necessarily blame Cook and company for this -- it's the largest company in the world, and few were there when it all started -- it doesn't change the fact that incentives aren't aligned as strongly as they are at a company like Alphabet. On the other hand, I am encouraged by what employees seem to think of working at the company. Using Glassdoor.com, I see that Apple gets four out of five stars, with 79% who gave an opinion saying they'd recommend working there to a friend, and Cook getting a 94% approval rating. Those are all very high marks. I believe employees with such a high level of satisfaction are more likely to be open to learning from mistakes and pivoting their focus when the time calls for it -- the tenets of antifragility. Grade for skin in the game = C+ Financial fortitude Finally, we have a more traditional metric, the amount of cash a company has, how much it brings in on an annual basis, and how much debt it carries. Debt is the ultimate bringer of fragility -- it reduces your options in times of stress and puts you at the whim of your debtors. Cash is the ultimate antifragile tool during a macro-financial crisis, as it gives you options: buying back shares on the cheap, outspending rivals to gain market share, or making acquisitions. On all of these traits, Apple is very strong. It sports cash (including long- and short-term investments) of almost a quarter-trillion dollars -- against a debt load of "just" $73 billion. In addition, it brought in $54 billion in free cash flow and used less than 25% of it to pay its dividend. Grade for financial fortitude = A+ So how Antifragile is Apple? By my own scoring system, Apple is right in the middle of the pack. While the barbell strategy looms the largest, the company gets a grade of B. An "antifragile monopoly" it is not, but it's no slouch, either. That's why I've maintained my own skin in the game with the stock, as it accounts for 3% of my family's real-life holdings.

Apple Valley beat the Maple Grove Crimson, 77-54, to advance to the championship game against Champlin Park Saturday night. (Special to the Pioneer Press: John Autey) By Jace Frederick | jfrederick@pioneerpress.com | Pioneer Press PUBLISHED: March 24, 2017 at 9:55 am | UPDATED: March 24, 2017 at 2:33 pm Sign up for newsletters and alerts Most Popular Minneapolis toddler found and suspect in custody after abduction, Amber Alert Police release name of worker killed in Woodbury accident Tricks, tips we’ve learned while writing about the St. Paul dining scene Wild recall top prospect Joel Eriksson Ek from Sweden After Minnesota mayor’s swindle, weapon arrest, 2 on council want him to resign Human remains found in woods near Brainerd The current crop of talent in Minnesota high school basketball might be as good as it’s ever been. The list of Division I players competing in this week’s state tournament went on and on. There are Lakeville North forward Nathan Reuvers, Cretin-Derham Hall center Daniel Oturu and Champlin Park forward Theo John, to name a few — all high-major Division-I commits. Champlin Park’s McKinley Wright defends Apple Valley’s Gary Trent Jr. during the first half of the Class 4A Boys Basketball Championship game at the Target Center in Minneapolis on March 14, 2015. (Pioneer Press: Sherri LaRose-Chiglo) But Cretin-Derham Hall coach Jerry Kline Jr. noted one similarity in the teams that won games in the Class 4A tournament. “They’ve got guards,” Kline said. “That’s just a (bigger) piece of the game than it was maybe 20, 30 years ago. … You’ve got to have a point guard. They run the show. They’re the quarterback of what we do as coaches.” So, it’s likely no coincidence this year’s best teams had the best guards. The Class 4A semifinals alone included Apple Valley’s Tre Jones, Champlin Park’s McKinley Wright IV and Maple Grove’s Brad Davison. Jones thoroughly outplayed Davison, a Badgers commitment, in Thursday’s semifinals as Apple Valley (29-2) blitzed Maple Grove to set up a state final between undefeated Champlin Park (31-0) and an Eagles team that gave the Rebels their only loss of the season in the 2015 state title game. Yet even with that history, the most intriguing story line is the clash between Wright, the best senior in the state, and Jones, the best junior. Wright is the odds-on favorite to win the 2017 Mr. Basketball award given annually to the state’s best senior. Jones was named Minnesota’s Gatorade Player of the Year this week. But what better way to truly determine the state’s best player, regardless of age, than 36 minutes of five-on-five basketball? Tipoff is set for 8 p.m. Saturday at Target Center. Wright is the Dayton commit who was never mentioned in the “best player in the state” discussion until this season, when he established himself as a do-it-all guard, the best player on the state’s best team. Jones has never been off the radar, though for years he was mostly known as the younger brother of Timberwolves point guard Tyus Jones. Out of his brother’s shadow, Jones became Apple Valley’s leader this season, stepping up with his words and actions. At the next level, he’ll have his pick of some of the nation’s top schools, with scholarship offers from Duke, UCLA and Arizona, to name a few. How close have the two guards been this season? Check out the averages: Jones, 23.5 points, 10.1 rebounds, 7.4 assists and 3.5 steals; Wright, 23.1 points, 8 rebounds, 7.3 assists and 2.2 steals.

He puts the rest of the guys in spots to be successful, too, which is huge. That’s probably the No. 1 quality of a point guard.” Champlin Park coach Mark Tuchscherer called Wright “a big general (who) gets guys where they need to be.” “I think you saw” that in Thursday’s semifinal game against Wayzata, he added. “He’ll score when he needs to and he’ll get the ball to his teammates in the right spots when he needs to.” Both point guards were spectacular when Champlin Park and Apple Valley met in December, a 91-84 Rebels win. Jones had 28 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists; Wright 27 points, 11 rebounds and six assists. When the two met in the 2015 state title game, when Jones was a freshman and Wright was a sophomore, Jones had 12 points, six rebounds and three assists and Wright had 17 points, six rebounds and three assists. Jones has been through the gauntlet of point guard match-ups at this year’s state tournament, battling Cretin-Derham Hall’s Ryan Larson in the quarterfinals and Davison in the semis, but Wright surely will be his stiffest test yet. Still, while Wright said playing guards like Jones brings out the best in him, and vice versa, he said he’s “not really looking for a one-on-one battle. I’m worrying about getting a win.” The feeling is mutual. “This time of year, you’re going to get the best match-up,” Jones said. “You can’t really worry about the one-on-one stuff, you’ve got to worry about the rest of the team. To win the game, you’re going to need great team play, not just yourself or the opponent going against you. Our focus for Saturday will be just a good, complete game.” Tags:  High school boys basketball Jace Frederick Jace has covered a slew of sports since he joined the Pioneer Press in May 2015, but his primary duty is covering high schools.

Showing what it calls a “Electronic Accessory Device,” could this be one of many ideas the company has for the iPhone and iPad? Apparently, so, and according to the images and information, it looks as though these two devices will remain at the heart of Apple’s plans for some time. Source: USPTO Apple Patent Re-Imagines The Future iPhone and iPad As for what this possible future has in store for both of the devices, it’s clear to see that a laptop style accessory was an idea. This accessory would act as a host for either device, with the computational power provided by the iPhone or iPad. Additionally, some of the Apple Patent images show them acting as a touchpad or touchscreen too. iPhone TrackPad As for the future iPhone concept, it’s seen in the image above acting as a device which connects directly into what looks like a MacBook. This laptop style accessory would be nothing more than a display and a keyboard resembling the familiar form factor. However, there’s no storage, CPU, or GPU; instead, all of these important features are provided by the iPhone. Without which the accessory would be nothing more than a dumb terminal. Additionally, however, due to the placement of the iPhone, the Apple Patent also envisions the handset acting as a trackpad. Will this future vision ever see the light of day? Who knows, as it’s quite possible this was a dead end by the Cupertino-based outfit and work has discontinued. Source: USPTO iPad Touchscreen Next up, on this Apple Patent, there’s a future iPad function. It too could be used with a laptop style accessory, lending its touchscreen as the display. Seeing as there are already keyboard cases available for the iPad, this isn’t too far-fetched an idea. Apple has talked about how it sees a future where the lines become blurred between laptops and tablet form factors. However, like the iPhone above, in this scenario, the iPad also would supply the brains, storage, and the graphical brawn. What’s clear about the future of the iPad and this laptop style accessory is it’s a concept which has variations. Some show an accessory that’s nothing more than a keyboard and trackpad, waiting for the iPad to plug the gaps. While another has the accessory offering a little more in the form of its own internal GPU. This important internal component would aid the iPad in rendering power hungry graphics. Would such an iPad accessory make it to market? Possibly not, the company’s current position seems to be placing the iPad as a replacement for laptops. However, the fact that this Apple Patent exists means it may have at some point it considered this an option. What we do know, however, is that this future iPad vision would certainly blur the lines between both form factors. Final Thoughts Have the above Apple Patent ideas been shelved? It’s possible, the company for the moment could be content with the lines being clearly drawn between its iOS and MacOS devices. The reasoning behind this could be due to the way in which its customers consume its products. After all, upgrades to iPhones and iPads are much faster than say with a MacBook. A such, making a Mac user consider using his/her iPhone or iPad to power a future laptop style device may take longer than is financially worthwhile.

(PRODUCT)RED iPhones are also available for in-store pickup at select Apple Stores starting today. The new 9.7-inch iPad is equipped with a faster Apple A9 chip and brighter Retina display compared to the iPad Air 2, which has been discontinued. It is also somewhat thicker and heavier than the iPad Air 2 since it lacks a fully laminated display with anti-reflective coating in order to keep costs down. The tablet's tech specs are otherwise identical to the iPad Air 2, including a display resolution of 2,048‑by‑1,536 at 264 PPI, 8-megapixel rear iSight camera, 1.2-megapixel front FaceTime camera, two speakers, Lightning connector, 3.5mm headphone jack, Touch ID with Apple Pay, and Bluetooth 4.2. The new 9.7-inch iPad starts at $329 for a 32GB model with Wi-Fi, making it the cheapest new tablet that Apple has ever sold. Apple also offers a 128GB model with Wi-Fi for $429, while cellular-capable 32GB and 128GB models are available for $459 and $559 respectively in Silver, Gold, and Space Gray. The new 9.7-inch iPad is now available to order on Apple's website in dozens of countries around the world. The first online orders are estimated for delivery between March 31 and April 5 in the United States. Apple said the new 9.7-inch iPad will be available to purchase at select Apple Stores, authorized resellers, and carrier stores starting next week in more than 20 countries, such as the United States, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. Apple's special edition (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models are also now available to order on Apple's website in 128GB and 256GB storage capacities for $749/$849 and $869/$969 respectively. Initial orders are slated for delivery on Tuesday, March 28 in the United States. (PRODUCT)RED iPhones have a vibrant red finish complemented by a silver Apple logo and white front bezels. Apple said the models are in recognition of more than 10 years of partnership between Apple and (RED), which gives customers a way to contribute to the Global Fund in support of HIV/AIDS programs in Africa. If you want a red iPhone today, try your local Apple Store. It’s in stock right now around the world. pic.twitter.com/hJt8o5sXF7— Joe Rossignol (@rsgnl) March 24, 2017 The special edition iPhone joins the current (PRODUCT)RED lineup, which is available to purchase year-round, including the full iPod line of products, Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones, Beats Pill+ Portable Speaker, the iPhone 7 Smart Battery Case, and a range of accessories for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. (PRODUCT)RED iPhones are available starting today at many Apple Stores, authorized resellers, and carrier stores in the United States and dozens of other countries. Apple said the new models will begin shipping to customers by the end of March in the United States and more than 40 countries and regions.

Xconomy Xperience EXOME National Regions Channels Events Top Entrepreneurs’ Advice → Kayak Expands to New Platforms as A.I. Assistants Proliferate Jeff Engel March 24th, 2017 @JeffEngelXcon @xconomy Like Us Xconomy Boston —  [Corrected, 3/24/17, 2:37 p.m. See below.] As Kayak attempts to build a better virtual travel agent, the tech firm is expanding beyond its core website and mobile app, and establishing a presence on additional types of technology platforms. Since mid-2015, Stamford, CT-based Kayak has made its travel-search service available to consumers on Apple Watch, Slack, Facebook Messenger, Microsoft Teams, Apple TV, Amazon Alexa devices, and Google Home. The integrations with these outside platforms illustrate how businesses are adapting to changing consumer habits and trying to figure out the right ways to interact with users across an array of apps and devices. The moves also speak to the growing emphasis by consumer-focused businesses on deploying products and services powered by artificial intelligence-related technologies, such as chatbots on Facebook Messenger and Slack, and voice-controlled virtual personal assistants like Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant, and Apple’s Siri. “We have to be where the consumer is,” says Giorgos Zacharia, Kayak’s chief technology officer. “The consumer should be able to use Kayak in whatever their platform of choice is.” I recently met with Zacharia (pictured above) and Kayak chief scientist Matthias Keller at the company’s engineering headquarters in Cambridge, MA, to get an update on the company, which is owned by The Priceline Group (NASDAQ: PCLN). Much of our conversation centered on Kayak’s work to add more features to its mobile app and branch out to these other technology platforms. These aren’t exactly blockbuster product releases or big shifts in the 550-person company’s business strategy. But that seems to be by design. “We believe a lot in incremental innovation,” Zacharia says. “We’re becoming more of this complete virtual travel agent.” Zacharia says some of the integrations with outside technologies are mostly intended for “aspirational exploration” of flights, hotels, and other travel items. The Apple TV app, for example, enables users to browse “featured destinations and getaway themes,” or conduct a specific search by dictating the question to the Siri-enabled remote, Kayak says. With the Amazon Alexa skill, a user might ask the virtual personal assistant to look up cities where he or she can fly to in September on a $500 budget. (Alexa can also track flight status.) One of the challenges will be making sure Kayak gets the user experience right and makes the new offerings useful enough to keep people coming back. The Apple Watch app lets users get flight notifications, price alerts, and quick access to itineraries. You probably wouldn’t want to use it for flight search—scrolling through dozens of flight options on the tiny screen wouldn’t be convenient. And when searching flights or hotels via the Alexa voice assistant, she only reads off a short list of options that fit your criteria. “We’re not going to give you 2,000 results on Alexa,” Zacharia says. Currently, with most of these outside platforms, the user must still switch over to Kayak’s website or mobile app to complete the purchase (although Zacharia says the company is working on enabling purchases via the Alexa skill). It’s an extra step to a sale, but Zacharia doesn’t see that as an issue. “They should be able to access Kayak in the way that is most convenient to them at that particular time,” Zacharia says. “It’s up to Kayak to provide the best user experience. We are learning what it takes to get the user to what they need as fast as possible. … The fact they chose to interact with that platform, it’s a positive.” Zacharia sees these expanded offerings as new “channels” for enticing users to book trips through Kayak. And with the chatbots, “it’s a more efficient way to provide customer support,” Zacharia says. It’s hard to tell whether these new initiatives are paying off, since it’s still early, and Priceline doesn’t break out Kayak financials in its earnings reports. Meanwhile, Kayak continues to try to find ways to make its mobile app more useful. It’s a key part of the business: these days, more than a third of travel bookings take place on mobile apps, Zacharia says. The advancements are mostly around making Kayak’s app more “context-aware,” he says. One example is a feature that provides Kayak users with … Next Page » Single PageCurrently on Page: 1 2 Jeff Engel is a senior editor at Xconomy.

Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman today said Amercian phone-maker Apple's demand for tax incentives to set up a manufacturing unit in the country will have be looked at after the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is rolled out. "GST will be coming soon. So, tax-related incentives demanded by Apple will have to be looked from a different angle," Sitharaman told PTI on the sidelines of Chemexcil function here. The government has not accepted most of the demands of the iPhone maker, she added. Apple plans to set up a manufacturing unit in Bengaluru this year, where it will assemble its products, probably only iPhone 6 and 6s models, according to reports in a section of the media. The American tech giant has sought various concessions on taxation and import of components for setting up the unit. The Cupertino-based technology giant currently manufactures in China and Brazil. Apart from tax sops, Apple also wants relaxation in the mandated 30 per cent local sourcing of components. Earlier reports had said the company would be importing all its components on the grounds that it is bringing in cutting-edge technology to the country. Apple also wants to open a fully-owned retail outlets in the country.In January, Apple had indicated to the government that it was ready with a blueprint to begin manufacturing iPhones, but wants fiscal concessions, including Customs duty waiver on imported components. tags #Apple #Business #Commerce and Industry Minister #Goods and Services Tax #GST #Nirmala Sitharaman #tax incentives Related news Business Principal Sessions Court rejects bail plea for Stayzilla founder Mar 28, 2017 10:12 PM Business Truecaller ties up with Airtel, ICICI Bank and Google Duo Mar 28, 2017 10:00 PM Business Toshiba's Westinghouse to file for US bankruptcy Tuesday: Sources Mar 28, 2017 09:01 PM Business PVR sees 90% jump in revenue to Rs 4,000 cr in 5 yrs Mar 28, 2017 08:51 PM Business Govt reduces number of ports to 14 for imports of scrap Mar 28, 2017 08:45 PM Business Xiaomi to create over 20,000 jobs in India in 3 years Mar 28, 2017 08:41 PM Business SBI to raise stake in SBI Card to 74 pc by June-end Mar 28, 2017 08:35 PM Business IRFC declares Rs 340 cr as dividend for 2016-17 Mar 28, 2017 08:23 PM Business SC reserves order on pleas for ban on sale of BS-III vehicles Mar 28, 2017 08:03 PM News Most Popular Top News Maybe it's time for hostile takeovers; govt must back honest risks: Uday Kotak D-Mart bumper listing: Should you buy, book profits or hold shares?

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Security Despite Apple denial, hackers prove stolen iCloud data is real Chris Smith @chris_writes March 24th, 2017 at 10:33 AM Share Tweet Apple confirmed on Thursday that its servers were not hacked, after reports earlier this week claimed that hackers are holding hundreds of millions of accounts for ransom. Even though Apple said it did not suffer a data breach, and that it’s monitoring the situation, the publicity-hungry Turkish Crime Family (TCF) hackers still have an April 7th deadline in mind. At that point, they say they will remotely wipe hundreds of millions of iPhones that are tied to the Apple ID databases they have obtained. While it all sounds pretty questionable, a new report indicates that the hackers may indeed be sitting on a huge cache of genuine Apple ID accounts, complete with passwords. Don't Miss: Netflix has 25 new originals set for release in April – here’s the full list The hackers gave ZDNet a sample of 54 sets of credentials, and the tech blog discovered that the accounts were indeed valid. ZDNet contacted the users, who appear to all be UK-based, and verified the passwords. Of the 54 accounts, only 10 were still in use. The people were using different cellular networks, and they owned different devices, including iPhone, iPad, and Macs. These details seem to indicate that the data doesn’t originate from one specific carrier, and that no single Apple product line has somehow been compromised. Most of the account owners in this case say that they have had the same passwords on iCloud for four or five years, and they also use the same email address and password combinations on other sites. Three people said the iCloud email and password were unique to iCloud, which is a puzzling detail for this investigation since Apple denies that its servers were breached. ZDNet believes that the data may come from breaches that occurred between 2011 and 2015. The overall implications of these findings are clear: the threats are not empty. All users should go ahead and change their iCloud password right now, and it never hurts to enable 2-factor authentication as well. Also, users should make sure they don’t use the same user name and password combination anywhere else, no matter how convenient it might be.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Retail Image Source: YouTube Apple’s new RED iPhone 7 and its cheapest iPad ever go on sale at 11AM today Chris Smith @chris_writes March 24th, 2017 at 9:39 AM Share Tweet It’s not just a regular Friday for Apple fans, as the company’s recently announced red iPhone 7 and the brand new iPad are going on sale today. Apple’s website is currently down in preparation for the sales, which are scheduled to start at 11:01 AM EDT today. Don't Miss: Netflix has 25 new originals set for release in April – here’s the full list Apple earlier this week announced a brand new iPhone 7 color, a new iPad, minor iPhone SE and iPad mini updates, and a slew of accessories. You can check out every single new product Apple announced right here. The red iPhone 7, part of Apple’s PRODUCT (RED) campaign, looks amazing — check out a hands-on unboxing video at this link. Other than the red color though, nothing changes inside the phone. The red iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus each come with only two storage options, including 128GB and 256GB, just like the Jet Black versions. Prices start at $749 for the 128GB iPhone 7. The brand new 9.7-inch iPad replaces Apple’s iPad Air 2, and it looks like Apple is killing the Air brand across product ranges. The device features a better A9 processor and a better screen, and it comes in 32GB and 128GB versions. The new iPad is available in silver, gold, and space gray, and ships in the expected Wi-Fi-only and Wi-Fi + Cellular options. Prices start at $329 for the 32GB iPad, which is the lowest entry price ever for a brand new 9.7-inch iPad. Even a new iPad mini is more expensive, starting at $399, but the mini only comes with 128GB of storage. The refreshed iPad mini, as well as Apple’s new iPhone and Apple Watch accessories, are also available to purchase from Apple’s online store.

 The first 'Super Mario' game for Android is excellent, gorgeous, and too short Ben Gilbert Mar. 24, 2017, 10:36 AM 5,023 facebook linkedin twitter email print Good news: The first "Super Mario" game for iPhone and iPad — which finally arrived on Android this week, after a 99-day exclusivity period with Apple — is really, really good.  Nintendo/Apple The game is "Super Mario Run," and it's the first smartphone game starring Nintendo's ubiquitous mustachioed plumber. It looks like classic 2D Mario, and it plays like it too. Nintendo There's one huge caveat: This isn't a Mario game about pixel-perfect jumps and deep challenge. Yes, Mario moves from left to right, and there are enemies/obstacles in the way of his progress. But you don't actually control the speed or direction of Mario's movement. Instead, little Mario automatically runs from left to right — your one job is to tap the screen to jump. If you hold after tapping, Mario jumps a little higher. No swiping, no virtual d-pad on-screen, no Bluetooth gamepads connected to your iPhone/iPad/Android phone. Instead of worrying about moving Mario forward, you're instead concerned with stomping on enemies and carefully timing your taps to jump at just the right moment. Nintendo That doesn't mean "Super Mario Run" is easy, per se. It's slightly easier than your average Mario game, perhaps, but there's still plenty of challenge to be found. If you've spent any time playing "Super Mario" games, you're rarely going to find yourself unable to complete a level in "Super Mario Run" solely because of enemy placement or intentionally challenging level design.  Much of the challenge in "Super Mario Run" is in the game's "pink coins" mechanic — collect all five pink coins strewn throughout a given level, and the level moves them to five new, slightly harder to find places. Collect those, and the five pink coins become five bronze coins hidden in question mark boxes, down pits, and in the clouds. I've only found all three sets on the very first few levels, and finding the final five bronze coins was genuinely tough. This is one of the easier to find pink coins. Nintendo Another layer of replay value to the game's somewhat meager offering of 24 levels is the ability to play as a variety of other Mario characters.  In "Super Mario Run," you'll start out as Super Mario, but a gaggle of his friends also appear as playable characters. Maybe you're more of a Princess Peach kinda player? Perhaps you identify most with an affable green dinosaur named Yoshi?  Both are playable characters in "Super Mario Run," with a total of six to choose from. Since each of the characters plays slightly differently — Luigi jumps higher, Princess Peach floats in mid-air, etc. — you could replay levels to get more excitement out of them. Nintendo So, what else does "Super Mario Run" have to offer? There are two modes that are distinct from the classic Mario gameplay of "World Tour" mode — they are "Toad Rally" and "Kingdom Builder." In the former, you race against other players to collect the most coins, stomp the most enemies, and generally play as skillfully as possible. If you do better than your opponent, you're rewarded with new followers (Toads of various types). The more followers you have, the higher your level is; the higher your level is, the larger your kingdom is. And that last bit is important, because it determines the size of your buildable land in the "Kingdom Builder" mode. If you've ever played "Clash of Clans" or "Game of War," you're already familiar with this game mode — you build stuff using coins earned in the "World Tour" mode. This stuff ranges from decorations (mushrooms of various types) to houses for various Toads.  Nintendo But let's be clear: Both Toad Rally and Kingdom Builder are ancillary modes to the meat and potatoes of World Tour mode. Players are coming to "Super Mario Run" looking for classic Mario gameplay, and World Tour mode is where they're going to find it. Thankfully, the two ancillary modes serve to complement World Tour. Kingdom Builder allows you to see the progress you're making in the game beyond just completing levels; Toad Rally allows you to put your playing skills to the test against other players. Neither is fantastic by itself, but they do a good job of accenting the classic Mario gameplay of World Tour. So, should you spend $10 on "Super Mario Run"? I think you should, yes. Nintendo There are no microtransactions, so that $10 is an "all-in" price. And for that $10, you get a solid — if somewhat limited — "Super Mario" game from the folks who created the franchise. "Super Mario Run" isn't going to make anyone's top five list of all-time Mario games, but it's certain to please returning fans and new fans alike. Since I started this with some good news, here's some more: There's a free version of "Super Mario Run" that has the first three levels in entirety available to play.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Reasons why iPhone SE can beat Sony Xperia X, OnePlus 2, Nexus 5X and other smartphones under Rs 25,000 Apple iPhone SE's competitive pricing will give Sony Xperia X, OnePlus 2, Nexus 5X, Moto Z Play and Xiaomi Mi 5 a run for their money. Raymond Ronamai   March 24, 2017 19:57 IST Apple's iPhone SEApple India Big screen smartphones might be the in-thing, especially among the youth who spend so much time on phones either chatting, watching videos or playing games, but there is a sizable chunk of consumers who still prefer a device that comfortably fits in the hand. This is why Apple's iPhone SE has many takers. Now, Apple is making its iPhone SE available at a very aggressive price. All authorised offline retailers have come up with Rs 5,000 cash back offer, making the 16GB variant available at Rs 19,999 against the original price of Rs 39,000 and the 64GB variant at Rs 25,999 against the earlier price of Rs 44,000. Also read: Make in India: When and what iPhone models will Apple start producing in Bengaluru? The cash back offer started on March 17 and will close by the end of this month. The offer can be availed only by using a credit or debit card from select banks. [Complete list of banks that offers cash back on iPhone SE purchase].  Well, even fans of Android phones may find the iPhone SE irresistible for more reasons than one. Firstly, the current pricing. An iPhone below Rs 20,000 is like a dream come true, given the phone's elite status. Secondly, the iPhone SE is a great phone from every angle. It is an iPhone 6s (Apple's 2015 flagship) in the body of an iPhone 5S. The iPhone SE has a 4-inch retina display with 1,136x640 pixels (326 ppi pixel density), an A9 chip, an iOS 9.3 operating system, 16GB/64GB internal storage, a 2GB RAM, a 12MP iSight main camera with 1.22Âµ pixels, a 1.2MP front-snapper, and a 1,624mAh battery. The iPhone 6s share almost all the features except the screen size (but same PPI) and a slightly bigger battery. The iPhone SE is one of the most stable handsets available in the market, and with this pricing, it can beat popular devices like the Sony Xperia X, OnePlus 2, Google Nexus 5X, Moto Z Play, Xiaomi Mi 5 and other smartphones under Rs 25,000.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones iPhone 8 will launch in September – good luck buying one Apple iPhone 8 aka iPhone X will be available in limited quantities, analysts warn. Sami Khan   March 24, 2017 20:00 IST [Representational Image]Apple Press Kit We all are excited about the new iPhone coming this year, even though it's several months from now. But constant updates on the development of Apple's 2017 flagship is keeping fans tuned in ahead of the major event, which is expected to take place in September. Everything from the new iPhone's name to its key specifications has been a hot topic of discussion for many fans, but there's always something new popping up to push aside or build upon the earlier rumours. The latest development in the new iPhone saga is that Apple will indeed launch the high-end iPhone 8, or the other names it has earned like iPhone Edition, iPhone X, iPhone Pro or simply the iPhone, in September. If the past history of iPhone launches has taught us anything, it is that Apple's diehard fans will wait in lines for hours just to be among the first one to own the new symbol of status. For years now, Apple hasn't disappointed its fans and first-time buyers by stocking enough units of the newly-released phones across its stores. But there's a first time for everything. This year, things will be difficult for consumers. According to Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis, Christopher Hemmelgarn, Thomas O'Malley, and Jerry Zhang, the new iPhones launching to mark Apple's tenth-year anniversary will be available in limited quantities in September. All those who plan to get in line for the new iPhone this year might not be as lucky as in the previous years. "Suppliers generally had good things to say about the upcoming iPhone 8 launch (for our purposes iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and iPhone Pro) as new features drive a more complicated manufacturing process and higher ASPs. We now believe that all three devices will feature wireless charging and will all be launched in the normal September timeframe, although the majority of iPhone Pro volumes may not be available until Q4," Barclays researchers noted in their latest research, MacRumours reported. The analysts also noted that shipping estimates could be delayed to several weeks soon after the pre-orders begin. A hint of that was already seen in last year's iPhone 7 Jet Black edition, which was hard to find throughout the holiday season. You can blame to complex manufacturing process involved in the iPhone 8, which will create a misbalance in the supply and demand. After all, we are expecting some of the unseen tech in the new iPhone this year. As far as rumours go, the high-end iPhone edition will have a 5.8-inch OLED display, Touch ID integrated within the display, virtual buttons and wireless charging support. This means a massive design transformation we have ever seen in an iPhone till date. So brace yourself for the great, but also lower your expectations when it comes to buying one in the earliest days. Related How safe are your iPhones, Macs from CIA?

The launch of its OnePlus 3 has only bolstered this reputation. OnePlus has long been described as an 'Apple killer' and although it's unlikely to ever topple the Californian behemoth, its latest handset could steal away a large proportion of its loyal fanbase. The OnePlus 3 more than lives up to the months of hype and, while far from perfect, earns its title as a flagship phone. ADVERTISEMENT Updated 11.06.2016, 13:25: This review has been updated to reflect the fact WIRED has now being using the device for a month. The score has remained the same. Design WIRED READ NEXT Eight real-world ways Brexit has hit science, technology and design Eight real-world ways Brexit has hit science, technology and design By Matt Burgess The OnePlus 3 is not only a great looking device, it feels much more expensive than its £309 price tag. This price was recently increased following the EU Referendum, but even at £329, the price is still fantastic. The aluminium alloy body is heavy enough to make it feel sturdy – a feature the iPhone doesn't have when out of a case - and the metal is a welcome relief from the plastic casing of other similarly-priced Android phones, such as the LG G4. The OnePlus 3 also ships with a pre-installed screen protector for extra protection. In the month that we have been using the device, there have been a couple of times we have stumbled or dropped the device. Thankfully the screen hasn't smashed, but without a case on, the OnePlus 3 does feel a little fragile and can pick up knocks and scratches easily. And the cases the firm provides feel cheap and are ugly in comparison to the original casing. It's 7.3mm thick, significantly thinner than the 9.9mm OnePlus 2, and its 5.5-inch 1080p Optic Amoled display has "one of the world's thinnest bezels". This incredibly thin bezel means the phone doesn't feel much larger than the iPhone 6S and certainly doesn't feel as large as the 6S Plus, despite the almost identical measurements. ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT WIRED Awake: 10 must-read articles for February 2 WIRED Awake: 10 must-read articles for February 2 By WIRED On the downside though, the thin bezel means holding the phone can be difficult. We would often select menus and apps on the edges of the screen by accident and having to hold it as if it's fragile detracts away from the sturdy first impression. This is particularly the case when using the phone in bed, or while laying down for example, and we often dropped the phone on our face or chest attempting to hold it in such a way that didn't impact the screen due to this thin bezel. Display WIRED The OnePlus 2 display lacked the contrast and vibrant colours seen on its rivals, namely Samsung’s Galaxy range, and this has been remedied on the OnePlus 3. OnePlus 3T review: just like the OnePlus 3, but with a better camera OnePlus 3T review: just like the OnePlus 3, but with a better camera OnePlus 3 4 days ago ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT OnePlus suspends sales of flagship smartphone in mainland Europe OnePlus suspends sales of flagship smartphone in mainland Europe By Matthew Reynolds Its 5.5-inch, full HD Amoled screen features a dual-polarising layer which is said to "produce colours that are more vivid and true-to-life than ever before, even in bright sunlight" and in tests, we found this to be largely true. Compared to the iPhone, as well as LG's G4, Samsung's Galaxy S7 edge and the Nexus 6P, on the OnePlus 3 almost all areas of the screen, and apps, were visible in bright sunlight – when the display brightness was set to 80 per cent and above. However, when its screen was angled towards the Sun, this made it difficult and in some cases impossible to see what we were clicking on. Moving indoors, the phone's auto-adjust display setting dropped down to around 60 per cent and the display was still visible. In fact, we dropped it down to 20 per cent and could still make out apps and text. As part of a recent software update, OnePlus added a so-called sRGB colour mode to tone down the original default colour view. This has battery saving potential but will make the screen appear more dull. You also need to enable the developer options in Settings to further enable this sRBG mode. The benefit, beyond battery life, is that colours look more realistic. In addition to the supplied screen protector, the phone comes with damage resistant Corning Gorilla Glass 4. There is also an extremely subtle curve in this glass which makes apps, and videos in particular, appear to leap from the screen. This helps improve visibility. READ NEXT OnePlus confirms it is raising the price of its OnePlus 3 in the UK OnePlus confirms it is raising the price of its OnePlus 3 in the UK By Matthew Reynolds There is a downside to this though. The screen resolution doesn't quite match up to other rival flagship phones, namely the Galaxy S6 and S7 range because it runs full HD, rather than Quad HD (1080p resolutions that measure 1920x1080 pixels versus 2560x1440 pixels) And while claims about brightness and clarity made by the company are accurate – and photos, Instagram posts and album artwork truly shine on the large display – the screen itself smudges very easily. It's also extremely reflective, which takes away slightly from the great way it handles bright light. Camera At the launch for its latest flagship phone, the OnePlus 3 (pictured), CEO Pete Lau said the company would concentrate on one "true flagship" line WIRED On the rear of the phone is a 16MP camera, while the front-facing camera has an 8MP sensor. The rear sensor significantly protrudes from the back of the device, especially when compared to the iPhone and or the Huawei P9, which prides itself on having no discernible 'bump.' The P9 is 0.3mm thinner than the OnePlus 3 so there isn't any excuse. READ NEXT OnePlus ditches its budget 'X' smartphone line OnePlus ditches its budget 'X' smartphone line By Matthew Reynolds That said, having this large sensor does mean photos look extremely professional. OnePlus has a host of imaging technologies to make taking photos easier including Smart Capture, which uses HD Mode, Auto HDR and Dynamic De-noise to reduce noise. It does this by comparing several frames of the same photo and blending them together. Users can now also take a selfie using the front-facing camera simply by smiling at the screen. Other photography tools include Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS) and Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) to reduce blur as well as a manual mode, controlled comfortably with the side buttons, that offers the benefits of a DSLR, including support of RAW image files. WIRED Rather than having options hidden in menus, the majority of the useful settings are accessible from the camera screen and can be toggled off at the press of a button. We welcomed this at first, but the more we used the device the more difficult we found it was to switch between the various modes. READ NEXT OnePlus denies it is entering the virtual reality market OnePlus denies it is entering the virtual reality market By Victoria Woollaston The 'smiling selfie' feature on the front of the device does feel like a gimmick and some of our efforts made us look like we were grimacing. Elsewhere, when a photo is taken it doesn't automatically appear as a thumbnail on the camera screen. You have to navigate away from the camera to your Gallery or Photos app. The fact there are two locations these photos can be stored in is our first complaint, and not being able to quickly check an image is our second. Also, taking selfies in a group meant that the photo was taken as soon as the sensor registered a smile from one of the members, not when everyone was ready. There are countless phones with increasingly good cameras; even struggling HTC excels at its sensors, so the OnePlus 3 doesn't stand out massively from the crowd in terms of quality, nor is it as easy to use as our initial tests suggested. Software The handset runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow with an OxygenOS skin. Unlike skins seen on other manufacturer's phones, the OxygenOS is much less obtrusive. Its widgets are pre-installed but are hidden and can be accessed with a swipe of the left-hand edge. This page can also be removed entirely, making it much less jarring than HTC's BlinkFeed. READ NEXT OnePlus launches £309 flagship OnePlus 3 OnePlus launches £309 flagship OnePlus 3 By Victoria Woollaston OnePlus 3 is not trying to force health, productivity or other lifestyle apps on its users, like Samsung does for example, and it has a decent amount of internal storage. On the model we used, apps, images, videos, audio, cached data and three of our Spotify playlists used up just 1.94GB of the total 52.67GB. It doesn't list the operating system on this, but the phone is a 64GB model so it can be assumed a phone manufacturer is finally showing the true, available storage when in Settings. WIRED Although this still doesn't get around complaints about manufacturers over-selling storage on their phones - selling a 64GB phone with only 50GB available for example - it does make the true internal storage much easier to understand and transparent. The rest of the software stays relatively true to Android Marshmallow and this is welcomed in a non-Nexus device. READ NEXT OnePlus 3 VR launch: Everything you need to know OnePlus 3 VR launch: Everything you need to know By Victoria Woollaston This software recently got a series of updates and although the overall look and feel for it has remained the same, there are some tweaks hidden underneath. For example, the update has addressed a RAM management issue which means the phone now utilises more of the staggering 6GB of built-in RAM. This means apps can stay in the phone's memory for longer without having a dramatic impact on the performance of the phone. As part of the Oxygen OS 3.2.6 update on September 20, OnePlus issued a series of bug fixes to improve camera quality, optimise white balance and improve 1080p video recording. Elsewhere, the firm has optimised voice call quality of some IM apps, improved battery life when scrolling and boosting the touch accuracy when playing games.

Once the update has been applied, the smart software can be launched simply by pressing down on the homepage. – Read more: how to get started with Google Assistant One complaint we had while using the phone was not being able to quickly find apps or services, although this is a general complaint about Android itself rather than OnePlus 3 in particular. We often struggled to find an app or a setting compared to our experience with the iPhone. We also missed the Reachability feature seen on iOS. On such a large screen it was difficult to use the phone one-handed. Plus, the thin bezel made it difficult to reach our thumb into the far corners because our palm would select an app. READ NEXT OnePlus 3 VR launch date revealed - and you don't need an invite to buy one OnePlus 3 VR launch date revealed - and you don't need an invite to buy one By Victoria Woollaston Performance Inside the phone is a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, up to 2.2 GHz, which is said to give the phone a 40 per cent boost in graphical power, compared to the OnePlus 2, without impacting on the battery. It also features a industry-leading 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM to make the handset feel even faster. In particular, the power boosts have made it possible to increase the speed at which the new ceramic fingerprint sensor recognises a user. There was a noticeable speed and accuracy increase between the iPhone 6 and 6S' fingerprint scanner and the same can be said for the OnePlus 3. OnePlus claims the sensor can respond in 0.2 seconds and while WIRED hasn't physically timed this, we can't argue with the figure. It happens in the blink of an eye. Unlike the iPhone's home button that needs to be pressed to wake up the homescreen - and which can inadvertently unlock the device if a registered finger is used - the OnePlus 3 can be 'woken up' simply by tapping the display. Its fingerprint scanner is also touch-sensitive making it a smooth process when wanting to return to the homescreen from an app, for example. This adds to the overall high-end feel of the phone. Other connectivity options include those seen on almost every other flagship, high-end smartphone. These are namely, 4G LTE, 11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2 and GPS. Having spent a month with this touch-sensitive scanner, however, it can cause problems. Simply touching the button while removing the phone from a bag will unlock the device, and this led to apps opening, songs being changed and even calls being made by accident because the screen inadvertently unlocked. The phone also vibrates to register when a fingerprint has been recognised or detected. This is a minor complaint, and can be disabled, but became irritating after a while. Battery WIRED To accompany the power boosts, the OnePlus 3 uses Dash Charge technology which the company describes as a "faster, cooler and safer way to charge a smartphone". Dash Charge replenishes more than 60 per cent of the 3,000 mAh battery in 30 minutes - and this was true in tests. It can also lower the temperature of the phone while charging by shifting the power management process from the phone itself to the Dash Charge adapter. Over a 24-hour period of typical use, which included browsing the web, uploading a post to Facebook, scrolling through Twitter, responding to a selection of emails and playing Spotify for around four hours, battery levels hardly dropped. From 6pm last night, when the phone was on 100 per cent, to 5pm today the battery was on 55 per cent and was showing one day and eight hours left. This is an incredible feat. The longer we used the phone, though, the less time it seemed to last. The screen often used a large amount of battery even with the brightness dipped. A positive part of this drop was the fact that its battery life predictions appeared to 'learn' our behaviour to give an accurate reading. There is nothing worse than a phone claiming you have two hours left before dying 30 minutes later. Verdict The OnePlus 3 is almost perfect. It hasn't scrimped on style or substance and there are so many seemingly insignificant touches that actually make a vast difference to the overall impression of the phone. Any Android software with a skin is going to have its flaws, and Android itself has its own built-in, but this is the least offensive skin we've seen. There are a number of design issues, such as the super-thin bezel and large sensor, that seem to have been made to tick, albeit impressive, boxes that let OnePlus make claims about being the "world's thinnest" and having "more vibrant photos than ever before." However, these are minor sacrifices when you factor in the price of this fantastic phone. At £329 in the UK ($399 in the US and €399 in Europe), OnePlus has, seemingly deliberately, positioned itself to be cheaper than half the price of a 64GB, £699 iPhone 6S Plus. The phone was originally cheaper than it is now but following the EU Referendum, the company said it was forced to raise the price to £329 due to the performance of the Pound. OnePlus launches £309 flagship OnePlus 3 OnePlus launches £309 flagship OnePlus 3 Oneplus 14 Jun 2016 Add to this the fact the phone is dual-sim and it's no wonder comparisons with Apple continue to be made. We challenge anyone who currently has an iPhone not to be impressed with this device and this is the first Android phone in a long time that would make us seriously consider converting from iOS. However, Android as a software still lacks in some respects and it will be the software that stops the OnePlus 3 taking Apple's crown rather than the hardware and the phone's brilliant features. The value for money of this phone becomes even more to the fore when you factor in the firm's latest release, the OnePlus 3T. Rather than ride this wave of success of the original OnePlus 3 until next year, when cycles dictate OnePlus should bring out its next handset, the firm has released an upgrade. The phone is almost identical to OnePlus 3, with only minor upgrades that don't appear to justify the new device's price increase - certainly not if you're already a OnePlus 3 owner. The main improvements have been made to the handset's performance and its camera, yet the device costs £399. Granted, it's not as wide a price gap as between Apple models, for example, but it may not be worth shelling out another £300+ on a handset less than six months since the original was released. Unlocked, invite-free OnePlus 3 handsets are available - in either graphite or soft gold colours - on oneplus.net. Additionally, OnePlus 3 ran pop-up stores in New York, London, Paris and Berlin on June 15 to give customers a chance to see the phone for themselves. ADVERTISEMENT Due to the phone's popularity in Europe, however, the firm recently announced it was having to suspend sales in mainland Europe, as well as Hong Kong, for a month. This pause is, the company said, to give it "time to replenish" its stock. It sold an unprecedented number of handsets and the pause will apply from August 9 to September 16. In particular, sales are being paused only in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain.

Read More that does away with the need for a dongle like Chromecast. As long as the support for Miracast is built into both devices, you can wirelessly cast your screen, even without the internet (it uses Wi-Fi Direct protocol). Devices with Windows 8.1 and Android 4.4 and up support it. Now you just need to make sure your TV does too. This part can be a bit confusing because different manufacturers promote the same Miracast technology under different brand names. For instance, Sony calls it Screen Mirroring, while Samsung calls it AllShare Cast. If you’re looking to buy a new TV, look at supported devices here. If your device doesn’t support Miracast, you can add the functionality using a dongle like the Roku Streaming Stick or the Fire TV Stick. Microsoft and Belkin also make Miracast dongles for under $60. While Miracast was hailed as the wireless version of HDMI Stop Using HDMI: Miracast Is the Wireless Alternative You'll Love Stop Using HDMI: Miracast Is the Wireless Alternative You'll Love The next time you need to stream media between devices, remember the flaws of HDMI and consider using wireless Miracast instead.

Getting Miracast to work can sometimes be downright confusing. There’s a lack of clarity when it comes to the feature across different categories of devices. Plus, your device needs to be awake when Miracast is streaming, which can drain a smartphone’s battery fairly quickly. If both your devices have Miracast support, that’s well and good. But if they don’t, I wouldn’t suggest you go out of your way to make it work using dongles. Chromecast is a much better option. 6. Mirroring on Android There are a couple of ways for doing this on Android. Modern Android phones that run Lollipop and higher come with multiple mirroring options built in. If your manufacturer has set it up that way, you’ll find a Cast button in the Quick Settings section 8 Best Apps for Customizing Nougat's Quick Settings Panel 8 Best Apps for Customizing Nougat's Quick Settings Panel This is how you can customize the Quick Settings panel in Android 7.0 Nougat, and the eight best apps for it (that's right, you can put apps in your Quick Settings panel).

The simplest and most reliable way is to use the Chromecast. Swipe down from the top of the screen, tap on Cast, select your Chromecast and you’re in business. If you want to mirror to an Amazon Fire TV, another Android device, a PC or even an Apple TV, check out Koushik Dutta’s stellar Screen Recording and Mirror app. What’s the Best Method? HDMI is still the most reliable way to mirror your screen. If it just has to be wireless, look into Chromecast. While you might have some performance issues, depending on what’s on your screen, it’s perfectly fine for presentations and spreadsheets. You’ll find other, more obscure, maybe proprietary ways for mirroring your screen. But they won’t work as seamlessly or reliably as the options we’ve listed above.

Buy ratings were placed on Apple (AAPL), Under Armour (UAA), Adobe (ADBE) and Micron Technology (MU) on Friday, while Macy's (M) was downgraded. Apple A buy rating was reiterated on Apple at Nomura/Instinet, which raised its price target to 165 from 135.  The firm believes the expected introduction of the iPhone 8 later this year will outperform consensus expectations. Apple is preparing to start making iPhones in India to be more competitive in that important market and it just bought a task-automation app that makes its smartphones more useful. Apple stock fell 0.2% to 140.66 on the stock market today. Under Armour Under Armour was upgraded to a buy from hold by Jefferies, which raised its price target to 27 from 19. Analyst Randal Konik said an updated survey of 2,000 consumers compared to results from three years ago show the UA brand has strengthened and athletic apparel demand is robust. Under Armour has seen its shares lose more than half their value over the past year, which puts the stock at what Jefferies considers a good value. Under Armour stock climbed 3.6% to 19.66. IBD'S TAKE: Under Armour may get a buy rating from Jefferies. But the stock is in a long downtrend, hitting a 3 1/2-year low as recently as Wednesday. Sales growth has slowed and Wall Street expects the company to post outright losses in the first half of this year. Focus your attention on top-rated companies with strong, even accelerating growth whose stocks are setting up in bullish bases. Micron Technology A buy rating was reiterated on Micron Technology by Deutsche Bank, which raised its price target to 35, from 30. Analyst Sidney Ho based his buy rating on "favorable supply-demand and solid execution." The memory-chip maker late Thursday posted fiscal second-quarter earnings that beat expectations on in-line sales. It also guided to much higher sales and earnings for the current quarter. Micron shares 7.4% to 28.43, hitting a 2-year high intraday. Adobe Adobe Systems was upgraded to outperform from neutral by Credit Suisse, which raised its price target on the software company to 150 from 125. Analyst Michael Nemeroff cited "expectations for continued momentum in its highly profitable Creative Cloud business that we expect will lead to stronger than expected operating cash flows over the next few years." Adobe stock rose 0.65% to 127.70. Macy's Macy's was downgraded to neutral from buy at Citigroup, which set a price target of 30. Analyst Paul Lejuez said his initial buy rating "had been predicated on the idea that Macy's was doing the right things for the business and that it had an opportunity to put up better results against easy comparisons in 4Q16." However, he added, "Even though the company may be doing the right thing by closing stores, it is hard to have any confidence in when the business might turn following a weak 4Q16 and seemingly tough start in 1Q17. Macy's slipped 0.35% to 28.17.

If the answer is yes, perhaps listen up for this one. Every once in a while, seemingly low-key and low-price apps pop up in the market, claiming to have identified an imperfection or gap in Apple’s software, and in the next breath promising the fix for it. Some of these apps are superfluous to the user for the simple reason that the touted feature is already in place in Apple’s mothership software (in some shape or form), other apps are gimmicky or overly flawed. Speed-Up for Mac firmly sits in the opposite camp, the one where ostensibly small apps are extremely wholesome and deliver on the promised goods. So what does it promise you ask? Put simply, to speed up or slow down your iTunes playback, an option otherwise notably absent on macOS. If this sounds surprisingly succinct or sober to you, that’s because it is. Speed-Up treasures simplicity over bells & whistles, and is probably worth a look if you have ever caught yourself wishing for a speed lever in the thick of an Audiobook or Podcast session on your MacBook. Barring your MacBook runs an iTunes version older than 12.4 (the oldest iteration compatible), Speed-Up is going to seamlessly latch onto your iTunes controls after installation. That is to say, a second control panel will become available and inherit the playback settings and progression bar seen in iTunes. Speed up or slow down audio directly in iTunes The upside of the second start-stop panel? You guessed it, this one features the much needed box for speed settings, meaning you can customize the playback pace entirely to your liking. Long established in iOS, to this day Apple – for reasons beyond incomprehensible – has failed to provide users the option to speed up an Audiobook, slow down a Podcast or do whatever the heck you like to do to your sweet records on iTunes. Fortunately, there is now a remedy in Speed-Up. The app boasts customizable speed presets and keyboard shortcuts. What’s more is that it just recently churned out support for your Touch Bar on the latest MacBook Pro. As always when we decide to call attention to an app, I can confidently recommend and vouch for its functionality and ease of use. Available for free with a $3.99 in-app purchase, it is pretty good value (if you fit the customer profile) and – best of all – unlikely to bust your savings. Before we leave you with the link, a quick remark on the viability of DRM-protected content and Speed-Up: sources like Apple Music are exempt and won’t work. So there, told you it was a quick one. If that has not completely dissuaded you, and speeding up your audiobooks or podcasts on Mac sounds worth a couple of coins, try Speed-Up in the Mac App Store for free, and unlock the full app’s potential with a $3.99 in-app purchase.

 One chart shows the huge amount of money Apple is spending to buy its own stock Kif Leswing Mar. 24, 2017, 9:59 AM 10,167 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple might not be a growth stock like Amazon or other tech giants, but investors can appreciate that the company tries hard to raise its stock price through stock buybacks.  A chart from RBC analyst Amit Daryanani sent to clients on Friday underlines just how much money Apple is spending on its capital allocation program — about $6 billion per quarter over the past three years — powered by its $246 billion in cash on hand: RBC Capital Markets Apple also has a big dividend program. On average, it's spending $2.9 billion per quarter to pay out dividends since 2012. Here's the chart: RBC Daryanani and RBC Capital Markets believe that Apple may provide an update to its capital allocation programs during its next earnings call. One possibility, according to the note, is that Apple could increase its dividend by 15% and raise its buyback program from $30 billion to $35 billion. However, this would depend on how it sees the possibility of bringing overseas cash back to the United States after a possible tax cut.  Visit Markets Insider for constantly updated market quotes for individual stocks, ETFs, indices, commodities and currencies traded around the world.

The CIA has not commented on the authenticity of this and earlier WikiLeaks revelations. By: AP | New York | Published:March 24, 2017 7:39 pm Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment. The CIA has not commented on the authenticity of this and earlier WikiLeaks revelations. New documents from WikiLeaks point to an apparent CIA program to hack Apple’s iPhones and Mac computers using techniques that users couldn’t disable by resetting their devices. Security experts say the exploits are plausible, but suggest they pose little threat to typical users. They say that many of the tricks are older — the iPhone hack involves the 3G model from 2008, for instance. The techniques also typically require physical access to devices, something the CIA would use only for targeted individuals, not a broader population. “The most notable part of this latest WikiLeaks release is that it shows the CIA doing exactly what we pay them to — exploit specific targets with limited attacks to support our national interests,” said Rich Mogull, CEO of the security research firm Securosis. Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment. The CIA has not commented on the authenticity of this and earlier WikiLeaks revelations, but has previously said it complies with a legal prohibition against electronic surveillance “targeting individuals here at home, including our fellow Americans.” The agency declined further comment Thursday. DOCUMENT DUMP The leaks Thursday come about two weeks after WikiLeaks published thousands of alleged CIA documents describing hacking tools it said the government employed to break into computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs from companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. The latest disclosures are much more focused and consist of just 12 documents, all involving Apple products. The documents describe techniques for rewriting devices’ firmware in ways that would maintain a hacker’s access even if a user resets a phone or computer to factory settings. Doing so wipes out all apps and the operating system and installs a clean version; it is an extreme measure sometimes used to deal with technical problems, but is also the sort of step that someone suspicious of surveillance might take when getting a brand new phone. WikiLeaks suggested in a press release that the “CIA has been infecting the iPhone supply chain of its targets since at least 2008.” A December 2008 document describes “NightSkies,” a tool apparently designed to target the iPhone 3G; the document claims it can retrieve files such as contact lists and call logs and execute other commands. WikiLeaks suggested in a press release that the “CIA has been infecting the iPhone supply chain of its targets since at least 2008.” However, the document describes only how to install the malware on a “factory fresh” version of the 3G — specifically, the iPhone 3G running the 2.1 version of Apple’s operating system, both of which are now nine years old. CAVEATS GALORE But infecting all phones somewhere in the manufacturing process would be extremely difficult, said Mogull, especially given multiple layers of inspections conducted by Apple and its contractors. At most, he said, the CIA might have shipped a rogue phone individually to a target. And while it’s possible that the CIA developed similar techniques for later iPhone models, Mogull said iPhones from the past few years have much greater security, including digital security certificates that cannot be overwritten. A flag would be raised during the setup process if certificates do not match. Johannes Ullrich, director of the Internet Storm Center at the SANS Institute, said NightSkies might not even be a current project given that the document was last updated in 2008, while the leaks appear to have come in 2016. Other documents released describe similar exploits for Mac computers. One hides in the firmware of Apple’s Thunderbolt-to-Ethernet adapter and requires someone to plug in that adapter to install the malware. Another targets a specific Mac model, the MacBook Air with the Leopard version of the Mac OS system — current at the time, but now seven generations old. Ullrich said the Mac exploits all appear old. He added that some of the Thunderbolt issues have been fixed to make the hack more difficult to pull off.

By: PTI | Mumbai | Updated: March 24, 2017 7:44 PM The government has not accepted most of the demands of the iPhone maker, said Nirmala Sitharaman. (PTI) Commerce and Industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman today said Amercian phone-maker Apple’s demand for tax incentives to set up a manufacturing unit in the country will have be looked at after the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is rolled out. “GST will be coming soon. So, tax-related incentives demanded by Apple will have to be looked from a different angle,” Sitharaman told PTI on the sidelines of Chemexcil function here. The government has not accepted most of the demands of the iPhone maker, she added. Apple plans to set up a manufacturing unit in Bengaluru this year, where it will assemble its products, probably only iPhone 6 and 6s models, according to reports in a section of the media. The American tech giant has sought various concessions on taxation and import of components for setting up the unit. The Cupertino-based technology giant currently manufactures in China and Brazil. Also Watch: Apart from tax sops, Apple also wants relaxation in the mandated 30 per cent local sourcing of components. Earlier reports had said the company would be importing all its components on the grounds that it is bringing in cutting-edge technology to the country. Apple also wants to open a fully-owned retail outlets in the country. In January, Apple had indicated to the government that it was ready with a blueprint to begin manufacturing iPhones, but wants fiscal concessions, including Customs duty waiver on imported components.

These Are the Secret Tools Apple Uses to Fix Your Broken iPhone Screen A look behind the curtain of the Genius Bar. Behind the scenes at the Apple Store, this is how Geniuses fix your phone. A tipster leaked us some photos and video of Apple's iPhone screen replacement tools, which look pretty nifty. The tools are used at all Apple Stores and at Apple Authorized Service Providers, according to several people who have used the machines. "Right to repair" legislation being considered in eight states would require Apple and other electronics manufacturers to sell tools like this on the open market. According to former Geniuses, your broken phone is slid into this tray, which has two suction cups to pull up the screen and will hold it at a 90-degree angle while the repair tech disconnects the cables that connect the phone's digitizer, display, front-facing camera, and home button to the logic board. The repair tray has been seen before—in 2013, Cult of Mac was leaked photos and gifs of it in action. Without access to Apple's repair trays, third parties have made their own tools, such as iFixit's iSclack opening tool. What hasn't been reported before, as far as I can tell, is this press, which is used to put the screens back on iPhone 6S and iPhone 7 devices. These devices have an adhesive inside the edges of the phone that secures the screen. Repair techs use this machine to replace the adhesive and put a new screen onto your phone. Motherboard has stripped the audio out and replaced it with subtitles; a black box has been added to protect the identity of the person who sent it to us. According to someone who has used the machine, many Apple Geniuses heat up your phone before doing a replacement to get the adhesive to stick better. A gear pulls down the press, which applies pressure to the phone. A 15-second timer is started, and after it's done, there's a loud beep. Once the screen is replaced, Apple Geniuses put the phone into the iPhone Calibration Machine (revealed by Motherboard earlier this month) to re-key the Touch ID sensor and make sure the screen replacement was a success. Outside of Apple, independent repair techs improvise to get the same results: "A lot of people sandwich the phone between two books carefully," one tech told me. If any right to repair bills pass, those days could soon be over. Got any other proprietary devices, machines, tools, or information to share? Here's how you can securely contact me.

Wikileaks on Thursday released documents, originated with the CIA, which detailed methods for compromising Apple devices if an agent was able to gain physical access to the device, TechCrunch reported. “We have preliminarily assessed the Wikileaks disclosures from this morning. Based on our initial analysis, the alleged iPhone vulnerability affected iPhone 3G only and was fixed in 2009 when iPhone 3GS was released,” Apple said in a statement. “Additionally, our preliminary assessment shows the alleged Mac vulnerabilities were previously fixed in all Macs launched after 2013,” the company added. Nicknamed “Vault 7,” Wikileaks’ newest archive of documents is the second in a series of documents allegedly taken from a secure CIA network. “We have not negotiated with Wikileaks for any information. We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn’t in the public domain,” the Apple statement read. “We are tireless defenders of our users’ security and privacy, but we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users,” the tech giant added. Earlier, after a hacker or group of hackers threatened to remotely wipe data from millions of iPhones including photos, videos and messages, Apple denied any such breach into iPhones. The hackers, who call themselves ‘Turkish Crime Family’, asked for $75,000 in Bitcoin or Ethereum (a form of crypto-currency) or $100,000 worth of iTunes gift cards in exchange for deleting a large cache of iCloud and other Apple email accounts, Vice blog Motherboard reported. Reacting to the threat, Apple told Fortune: “There have not been any breaches in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud and Apple ID. The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services.” The hackers claimed to have access to nearly 559 million Apple email and iCloud accounts. The hackers provided screenshots of alleged emails between the group and members of Apple’s security team and threatened to reset iCloud accounts and remotely wipe victim’s Apple devices on April 7 unless Apple pays them. The Apple spokesperson, however, said that Apple is “actively monitoring to prevent unauthorised access to user accounts and are working with law enforcement to identify the criminals involved.” Publish date: March 24, 2017 7:08 pm| Modified date: March 24, 2017 7:15 pm Tags: Apple, Central Intelligence Agency, CIA, dark matter, Hacking, iPhone, Sonic Screwdriver, Vault 7, WikiLeaks Also read Hackers threaten to wipe “hundreds of millions” of iPhones, Apple says they can’t WikiLeaks releases Vault 7 “Dark Matter” Apple malware, with Doctor Who inspired “Sonic Screwdriver” X Recommended For You Meizu likely to bring optical fingerprint recognition to its smartphones Nirmala Sitharaman says that the govt. will look into Apple’s demands after GST rollout Apple has opened three new stores in China, Germany and United States Indian government and Apple debate on a workaround for ‘Make in India’ plans Subscribe to our newsletter GO You are Now Subscribed to our Newsletter - Stay Tuned !

April 23, 1984: Apple executives John Sculley, Steve Jobs and Steve... “Apple II Forever” was an event staged by a company still working out the bugs. The April 24, 1984, press and exhibitor gathering was late to start and later to finish. Apple executives sat on the kind of metal folding chairs that one would find at a recreation center singles dance. Steve Jobs — hair feathered gloriously — hadn’t quite settled into his permanent turtleneck-and-jeans uniform yet, choosing a bow tie, suspenders and Velcro-strapped Nike high-tops. But even at this early public launch of the Apple IIc computer, the marketing panache that would infuse countless future Apple events could be seen. We recently found rare Chronicle archive photos of the event at Moscone Center in San Francisco — one of the first spectacle-permeated launches of a new Apple product. The photos were taken by Gary Fong, a longtime Chronicle photographer and photo editor who often found artistic ways to shoot routine happenings. Included here are six of our favorite photos. (Plus a music video that may or may not have involved Pet Benatar.) Photo: Gary Fong, The Chronicle April 23, 1984: Apple executive Steve Jobs talks about the success of the Macintosh at the "Apple II Forever" event at Moscone Center in San Francisco. April 23, 1984: Apple executive Steve Jobs talks about the success... “$750,000 Party Introduces New Apple Computer,” the front page Chronicle headline read, calling the event “the opening shot of a lengthy marketing campaign that may change the personal computer industry forever.” Chronicle reporter John Eckhouse wrote: “The Cupertino company introduced its new $1295 portable computer named the IIc in a razzle-dazzle all-day show at Moscone Center that was part sales pitch, part revival and part carnival.” The Chronicle took dozens of photos, and the event looked downright sedate by Apple hype standards of the 21st century. But this was three months after Apple launched the Macintosh computer with the “1984” Super Bowl commercial, a wild success that led to 50,000 Macs being sold in the first 74 days. Apple was trying to one-up itself, with three huge video screens, surprises and a very 1980s musical interlude. Before Apple co-founders Jobs and Steve Wozniak and president John Sculley took turns speaking, the largest video screen showed a photo montage of the company’s history, which at that point was less than a decade old, set to a song called “Apple II Forever.” Thankfully, this video has showed up on YouTube for all to behold. It was sung either by Benatar herself or an incredible sound-alike. There are differing theories by Apple amateur historians. Whoever was responsible, the video is pure unfiltered 1980s. (We suggest watching it again later while drinking a Tab or some Riunite on Ice.) Photo: Gary Fong, The Chronicle April 23, 1984: Apple employees in the crowd lift up new Apple IIc computers at the "Apple II Forever" event. April 23, 1984: Apple employees in the crowd lift up new Apple IIc... Jobs showed sales figures for the MacIntosh and predicted that IIc would further humiliate IBM’s disastrous PCjr. Wozniak performed a comedy routine. An example of Woz humor, as reported by John Dvorak in the Sunday Examiner/Chronicle: “You know, Moscone Center is where the Democratic Convention is being held. And there are a lot of politicians hanging around in the back. Even Ronald Reagan was back there. So I asked him what he thought of the IBM PCjr. And he said, ‘Now, Steve, you know I don’t believe in abortion …” But the biggest surprise came from Sculley, who had led Pepsi’s marketing efforts before he came to Apple. After a 40-minute speech, Sculley gave the cue for Apple employees who had been planted in the audience to lift Apple IIc terminals high in the air, revealing the lightweight and portable assets of the computer.

April 23, 1984: Apple executives Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs and John... After the huge video screen presentation, Jobs, Sculley and Wozniak took seats in a room surrounded by Apple IIc terminals, taking questions from an enormous media scrum. At a time when Silicon Valley was still defining itself, the scene had more in common with a 49ers Super Bowl press conference than any product launch from the era. Jobs, looking handsome and dashing despite his strange clothing combination, smiles in most of the images. While the event was expensive, Apple and its executives were clearly positioning themselves as underdogs who were accessible to the people. After the press conference was over, Wozniak can be seen in photos hanging out in the crowd.

April 23, 1984: Apple executives Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak at a... The word “disruptor” wasn’t used once in the Chronicle articles covering the event, but that was the major theme. Jobs’ boldness was seen as arrogance by the Examiner’s Dvorak, who openly mocked the excess of the event. (“The speaker’s podium is on the far left of the huge stage,” Dvorak wrote, “so naturally Steve enters from the far right so he can walk across the entire stage in his hep cat attire.”) There was a swing-for-the-fences vibe throughout the presentation. Eckhouse’s story noted the massive advertising campaign to come. “In a new twist, Apple will direct some radio and print advertisements toward children, encouraging them to persuade their parents to buy a computer,” the Chronicle article stated. “One ad carries the headline, ‘How to talk your parents into parting with $1300.’” Photo: Gary Fong, The Chronicle Image 1of/3 Caption Close Image 1 of 3 April 23, 1984: Apple executives John Sculley, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak introduce the Apple IIc at the "Apple II Forever" event.

Photo: Gary Fong, The Chronicle ‘Apple II Forever’: Found photos offer early look at icons 1 / 3 Back to Gallery The Apple IIc was a mild disappointment — perhaps foreshadowed by an apparent no-show by the King of Pop. “Apple was supposed to have Michael Jackson, believe it or not, but he couldn’t make it because his hair was healing or something,” Dvorak wrote. “So for some unknown reason, they got Herbie Hancock’s Rockit Band for the star attraction.” Tech History Our S.F.: The era of the arcade: Play it again Macworld innovation through the years But the Apple executives were in a groove, testing out marketing strategies that would benefit the company for decades. There would be many hits in the future, and the image of tech executive as pirate and maverick and rock star would become crystallized in the culture. The business leaders would become icons, and the icons would help redefine the region. “If we are right, and I believe we are,” Sculley told the crowd, “Silicon Valley will never be the same.” Apple II Forever in the Chronicle The Chronicle covered the April 24, 1983, Apple II Forever at Moscone Center – which happened on the same day as a 6.2 Bay Area earthquake. The Chronicle’s John Eckhouse wrote the main story. San Francisco Examiner columnist John Dvorak followed up days later with his opinions in the Sunday Examiner/Chronicle.

Writing for The Guardian, Alex Hern says “Apple is tired of making Coca-Cola and now wants to sell champagne.” (Tip o’ the antlers to Christopher Cowan and Jason Davies.) Yes, Apple, the company that has been routinely pilloried as elitist for selling device that are too expensive, is now retroactively the device-maker for everyone. The Macalope wanted to make a reference to The Lathe of Heaven here as he is wont to do when tackling reality-challenged pieces, but he sees he did that already when writing about a different piece by Hern and he has a strict “one The Lathe of Heaven reference per customer” policy. Pity poor Rob Enderle who has not taken a good Ursula K. Le Guin-based barb in years. The Macalope can picture him now, driving slowly past various sci-fi and fantasy conventions in his El Camino, shouting out nonsensical things, hoping someone will respond with even a Left Hand of Darkness-based jab, let alone a pointed reference to The Earthsea Trilogy. Sad. Apple’s mobile product lines, like the iPhone and iPad, have suggested that it wants to make the Coca-Cola of the technological world. Hern’s thesis is that Apple used to only make one kind of iPhone. Now it makes several and may be introducing a “Pro” iPhone in the fall. This is new and represents a change in Apple’s thinking because hand wave, shadow puppets, monkey on a unicycle, and there you have it. Apple, of course, has made “Pro” products for years but… let’s just kind of pretend it didn’t. Heck, even its Jobs-mandated simplified product matrix of the late 1990s was divided into “Consumer” and “Pro.” And its enforced simplicity was largely driven by Apple’s need to focus and reduce costs, rather than that being the “right” way to do things all the time. None of this is new at all. Apple used to make one kind of Mac. Then it didn’t. Apple used to make one kind of iPod. Then it didn’t. Not only is this not new, this is literally Apple’s strategy. Enter a market with one product that redefines the experience, then iterate it and continue to expand the lineup to take more profit share. Hern belabors a quote from Andy Warhol about how when you and Liz Taylor and the president all drink Coke you’re all drinking the same kind of Coke, but the Macalope’s pretty sure George W. Bush didn’t use a blueberry iBook like the horny one did. If anything the shocker of the last few years is the company’s seeming abandonment of the professional desktop computing market, something that runs in complete opposition to Hern’s thesis and is not mentioned because we’re pretending Apple only makes mobile devices. Let us not get bogged down in annoying “facts” which are the molasses-covered walkway of going to your punditry job in the morning. Just because you woke up this morning and noticed Apple’s strategy being implemented doesn’t make it a change in strategy.

They decided to start SaladPower to create products that were lower in sugar and higher in vitamins than what they saw on the store shelves. What they’ve created is a four flavor line of 100 percent juice drinks that come packaged in 11.1 oz. Tetra Pak cartons. The flavors include Just Veggies, Veggies + Mango, Veggies + Pineapple, and Veggies + Apple. These varieties’ sugar content is 7g, 27g, 26g, and 18g, respectively. The company’s website, which not only calls out other players in the space as “misleading” but also offers a somewhat misleading competitive label comparison based on anecdotal evidence, really puts the focus on SaladPower’s better ingredients and lower sugar. But in reality, three of the four varieties list sugar content that is on par with at least some of the varieties offered by the companies on the chart. Comparing averages of the line is unfair, especially considering that their lineups are broader and include straight juices, such as apple and orange, that are naturally high in sugar. And after all, you’re typically just one product, not a composite that represents the average of an entire product lineup. In any event, we strongly suggest that they rethink this approach and consider the factuality of this and other information on their website. Putting that aside, let’s talk about the actual product offering from salad power. These products use concentrated juice that is reconstituted with water using levels that allow the product to achieve 100 percent juice content. Just Veggies, which is their lowest sugar product, includes water, carrot, kale, spinach, tomato, celery, green bell pepper, and cucumber (along with added vitamin C). It’s good, but not great, with flavors that aren’t as bright and fresh tasting as many of the premium or high pressure processed (HPP) juices out there. From there, adding fruit flavors to the mix results in something that’s reminiscent of V8 Splash: it’s lacking in freshness and balance. Honestly, we feel as though these products need a lot of formulation help if they are going to lure drinkers away from other juices -- or from an actual salad. On the outside, our feelings, unfortunately, don’t change: the product needs visual work, too. Not being able to see the liquid is going to be a challenge, as is being a shelf stable premium player trying to compete against perishable brands. If you look at the premium prices for refrigerated juices across the entire spectrum of the category, it’s widely understood that refrigerated will be more expensive than shelf stable. It’s also widely believed, whether it’s true or not in any particular case, that these products are better for you. But we don’t see that supported here. Furthermore, making the consumer think about salad, which is rarely, if ever, on the same level with a beverage in terms of refreshment and flavor, might undermine the brand’s ability to connect with the consumer in a meaningful way. Overall, SaladPower seems like a product that has good intentions -- the market certainly could use lower sugar offerings -- but the execution feels rough and comes up short when comparing it to what’s already on the market today. While low sugar and vitamin content are certainly important, we feel as though SaladPower is asking consumers to compromise flavor and brand to get it. And that rarely works in this business.

According to this report, Apple has put together an eclectic team of experts to work on AR, led by former Dolby Laboratories exec Mike Rockwell. From Bloomberg: Apple has built a team combining the strengths of its hardware and software veterans with the expertise of talented outsiders, say the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal strategy. Run by a former Dolby Laboratories executive, the group includes engineers who worked on the Oculus and HoloLens virtual reality headsets sold by Facebook and Microsoft as well as digital-effects wizards from Hollywood. Apple has also acquired several small firms with knowledge of AR hardware, 3D gaming and virtual reality software. The group is reportedly working on a pair of AR glasses that would place graphics and information right in front of your eyes. However, this project is said to be a long way off from release, if indeed it ever sees the light of day. For the moment, the team, which is said to report to Apple hardware engineering chief Dan Riccio, appears to be working to bring AR features to future iPhone models. For instance, the report claims that Apple is working on letting customers change the depth of a photograph taken by their iPhone well after the fact. They might also be working on a feature that would let you overlay digital objects and effects on a person in a photo, much like you can now in Snapchat. Assuming this pans out, what's unclear in any of this is a timeline. Right now, all we can do is wait and see.

Now, I've seen Apple come out of nowhere and dominate a market where it was late to the party, so there's still hope. 0 1 week ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Photo Credit: Apple advertisement | advertise on newsday A group of hackers claims to have breached Apple's iCloud platform and gained access to hundreds of millions of user accounts. If Apple doesn't pay a ransom, the hackers say they will remotely wipe the accounts. The hackers, who call themselves the "Turkish Crime Family," are asking for $75,000 worth of bitcoin or Ethereum, or $100,000 in iTunes gift cards, Motherboard reported on Wednesday. To encourage Apple to pay, the hackers are seeking publicity by sending screenshots of alleged emails between them and Apple's security team to media outlets. advertisement | advertise on newsday The hackers are threatening to reset some of the stolen iCloud accounts and remotely wipe victims' devices if Apple doesn't pay by April 7, according to Motherboard, which reported that the hackers didn't share any evidence of millions of hacked iCloud accounts other than a video of them allegedly logging into some of the accounts. Among the emails provided to Motherboard were a few from Apple's security team, which asked the hackers "to share a sample of the data set" and informed them that "we do not reward cyber criminals for breaking the law." Although hijacking accounts and demanding ransoms is not uncommon, the Apple extortion is unusual both for the size of the alleged breach and the relatively low ransom amount the hackers are demanding. Recent successful ransomware attacks have targeted lesser-known victims like hospitals and received millions of dollars in ransom payments. Still, the extortion is a good reminder that even Apple, whose systems thoroughly protect user data, is still a target for hackers seeking ransoms. It's also a good reminder to change the password of your iCloud account and set up two-factor authentication. This article originally appeared on PCMag.com. Get the Biz Briefing newsletter!

Wikileaks on Thursday released documents, originated with the CIA, which detailed methods for compromising Apple devices if an agent was able to gain physical access to the device, TechCrunch reported. “We have preliminarily assessed the Wikileaks disclosures from this morning. Based on our initial analysis, the alleged iPhone vulnerability affected iPhone 3G only and was fixed in 2009 when iPhone 3GS was released,” Apple said in a statement. “Additionally, our preliminary assessment shows the alleged Mac vulnerabilities were previously fixed in all Macs launched after 2013,” the company added. Nicknamed “Vault 7,” Wikileaks’ newest archive of documents is the second in a series of documents allegedly taken from a secure CIA network. “We have not negotiated with Wikileaks for any information. We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn’t in the public domain,” the Apple statement read. “We are tireless defenders of our users’ security and privacy, but we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users,” the tech giant added. Earlier, after a hacker or group of hackers threatened to remotely wipe data from millions of iPhones including photos, videos and messages, Apple denied any such breach into iPhones. The hackers, who call themselves ‘Turkish Crime Family’, asked for $75,000 in Bitcoin or Ethereum (a form of crypto-currency) or $100,000 worth of iTunes gift cards in exchange for deleting a large cache of iCloud and other Apple email accounts, Vice blog Motherboard reported. Reacting to the threat, Apple told Fortune: “There have not been any breaches in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud and Apple ID. The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services.” The hackers claimed to have access to nearly 559 million Apple email and iCloud accounts. The hackers provided screenshots of alleged emails between the group and members of Apple’s security team and threatened to reset iCloud accounts and remotely wipe victim’s Apple devices on April 7 unless Apple pays them. The Apple spokesperson, however, said that Apple is “actively monitoring to prevent unauthorised access to user accounts and are working with law enforcement to identify the criminals involved.” Publish date: March 24, 2017 7:08 pm| Modified date: March 24, 2017 7:15 pm Tags: Apple, Central Intelligence Agency, CIA, dark matter, Hacking, iPhone, Sonic Screwdriver, Vault 7, WikiLeaks Also read Hackers threaten to wipe “hundreds of millions” of iPhones, Apple says they can’t WikiLeaks releases Vault 7 “Dark Matter” Apple malware, with Doctor Who inspired “Sonic Screwdriver” X Recommended For You Meizu likely to bring optical fingerprint recognition to its smartphones Nirmala Sitharaman says that the govt. will look into Apple’s demands after GST rollout Apple has opened three new stores in China, Germany and United States Indian government and Apple debate on a workaround for ‘Make in India’ plans Subscribe to our newsletter GO You are Now Subscribed to our Newsletter - Stay Tuned !

Supply chain reports blamed the delay on two components: Apple’s in-house fingerprint sensor that would sit underneath the display, and 3D sensing modules from STMicroelectronics. Neither component would be ready for mass production until September, which means the phone could arrive only in October or November. Image Source: Moe Slah / Concepts iPhone / YouTube video (screenshot) What are your chances of getting the iPhone 8 on launch day? Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis and his colleagues recently took a trip to Asia. Curtis said in a research note (via MacRumors) that the iPhone 8 would still launch in September, but it will be available only in limited quantities. When Apple starts taking pre-orders, chances are the shipping estimates could go as far back as November within minutes. The iPhone 8 might be called something entirely different. Names like iPhone Pro, iPhone Edition, and iPhone X have also been doing rounds, but the rumor mill is still sticking to the iPhone 8 moniker. It is widely expected to have the most radical design overhaul since the original iPhone. The handset is rumored to come with a 5.8-inch OLED display, a glass-sandwich design, wireless charging, in-display fingerprint sensor, and no physical home button. Suppliers had all good things to say about the iPhone 8 Barclays analysts said Apple suppliers were optimistic about the iPhone 8 launch. New features in the device require more complex manufacturing processes. The research firm confirmed that all the three devices coming this September – the iPhone 7S, 7S Plus, and iPhone 8 – would feature wireless charging. The flagship iPhone 8 would launch in the “normal September timeframe,” but the majority of volumes may not be available until the fourth quarter. Barclays analysts also reiterated many of the previously rumored features. The 10th anniversary iPhone will have a 5.8-inch display, but the usable screen will be limited to just 5.15 inches. The remaining area at the bottom would house a new ‘function area‘ that will provide dynamic controls similar to the Touch Bar on the latest MacBook. They said the device would come with wireless charging capabilities, but other reports indicate that the wireless charging accessory would be sold separately. 10th anniversary iPhone to pack 2700mAh battery The iPhone 8 would sport a stacked logic board design to accommodate a bigger battery. According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the 10th anniversary iPhone will have a huge 2,700mAh battery even though its form factor will be similar to the 4.7-inch iPhone 7. The new logic board design would make room for an L-shaped battery. By comparison, the iPhone 7 packs a 1950mAh battery. Though the iPhone 8 is said to have a curved display, Japanese publication Nikkei Asian Review reports that the screen will be only “gently” curved on the sides. The edges won’t be as pronounced as the Galaxy S7 Edge. The curves will be there only for visual appeal. Supply chain sources told Nikkei that that curves wouldn’t offer any significant new functions. Paying homage to the original iPhone In another report, ETNews has learned from supply chain sources that the 10th anniversary iPhone would pay homage to the original one launched a decade ago. The first iPhone’s rear edges were heavily rounded. To replicate it, Apple will use 3D glass cases on the back that will make curves around the edges and corners. ETNews described it as a “water drop design.” Despite the curved edges, the rear panel would still be flat to facilitate wireless charging. A recent patent filing by Apple has sparked speculations that the iPhone 8 would feature facial recognition capabilities. The tech giant has been refining and improving the same technology since 2011. It uses the iPhone’s front camera to detect the face and authorize it if it belongs to the owner. If the phone has been motionless for a set amount of time, it would automatically lock the device. iPhone 8 to dive into AR Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities has said on several occasions that the upcoming iPhone would feature a 3D sensing module to support facial recognition and augmented reality (AR). Bloomberg reported earlier this week that the iPhone 8 would indeed feature tons of AR features. The company has a team of more than 1,000 engineers working on a bunch of AR products and games in Israel. Bloomberg’s claim corroborates with an earlier report from The Wall Street Journal that the device would include specialized hardware components for AR. Apple’s upcoming iOS 11 mobile operating system is also rumored to support augmented reality. Tim Cook is betting big on AR. He has expressed confidence that AR presents as big an opportunity as smartphones. With a major design overhaul and all these new features, the iPhone 8 is not going to compete with Chinese Android phones on price. It will be expensive. Inside sources told Fast Company that its price tag could be above $1,000. The 256GB iPhone 7 Plus costs users $969. Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities has also supported Fast Company’s claim that the new device would cost upward of $1,000. Fortunately, the 4.7-inch iPhone 7S is said to be more competitively priced.

A9 is Cheaper to Build than the A8X This Fool rolls up his sleeves and tries to show that Apple's A9 chip is not only better than Apple's A8X, but it's cheaper, too. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 24, 2017 at 8:45AM In a previous column, I offered up my thoughts on Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) latest low-cost iPad (marketed simply as iPad). In a nutshell, Apple built a much more cost-effective version of its iPad Air 2 to allow it to attack the $329 price point, while at the same time keeping a reasonable margin structure. In that article, discussing how Apple managed to cut costs in going from the iPad Air 2 to the new iPad, I made the following claim: For example, it uses the A9 chip, which is certainly cheaper to produce than the A9X found in the iPad Pro and is almost certainly cheaper to produce than the older A8X found inside of the iPad Air 2. The former statement (vis-a-vis the A9 and A9X) needs little justification, as the A9X is simply a more complex version of the A9. However, I feel that the comparison of the A9 and A8X cost structures is something that's probably worth justifying, and below, I intend to do just that. Apple's iPad Pro lineup. Image source: Apple. Understanding what drives chip costs In very basic terms, there are a few major factors that drive chip costs. The first is the cost of silicon wafers -- this largely depends on their manufacturing costs, and the profit margin that the contract chipmaker selling the wafers is hoping for. Typically, the more advanced a manufacturing technology, the more expensive the underlying silicon wafers are. The next is chip size: All other things being equal, a larger chip is more expensive to build than a smaller chip. This is because in such a scenario, silicon-wafer size and cost are fixed, meaning that for a given wafer cost, a chipmaker can produce fewer total chips. Not only that, but yield rates of larger chips -- again, all else being equal -- are lower than yield rates of smaller chips (here's a discussion of the economics of silicon wafers). Applying this to A8X vs. A9 The Apple A8X is manufactured using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (NYSE:TSM) 20-nanometer manufacturing technology. The A9 is sourced from both TSMC and Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) and is built using their respective 16-nanometer and 14-nanometer technologies. The A8X chip measures in at 128 square millimeters; the Samsung-built A9 comes in at 96 square millimeters, and the TSMC-built A10 measures 104.5 square millimeters. The 14/16-nanometer technologies upon which the A9 is built should be a bit more expensive than the one used to build the A8X (the "16-nanometer" technology used here can be thought of as simply a more advanced variant of the 20-nanometer, rather than an all-new technology), but the much larger die size of the A8X, relative to either A9, more than likely offsets the slight extra cost associated with the 14/16-nanometer technologies. The A9 is cheaper and better The nice thing about Apple's choice of the A9 for the low-cost iPad is that it's not only probably cheaper to manufacture than the A8X, but it's also a genuinely better processor. The A9 has faster processor cores than the A8X does (though the A9 has two and the A8X has three) and, per the 3DMark Ice Storm graphics performance test, a faster graphics processor than the A8X offers. I believe that the performance and user experience that the new iPad should deliver with the A9 will be superior to what a hypothetical low-cost iPad with an A8X could have delivered.

Ali says there are things Steve Jobs was spot on about, like fonts. We were worried to start with. That we wouldn't be able to locate the man who developed four Arabic fonts still in the Apple library for Mac back in the day - in the '80s, when the Mac was unheard of, a top secret mission - let alone ambush the creator of Arabic typefaces (fonts?) Geeza, Kufi, Damascus, Baghdad - and ask him a couple of questions. At an event called WAN IFRA (World Association of Newspapers and News Publishing) at a hotel by the water in Dubai last week, there must have been plenty of folks trying to nab him. Turned out, Dr Ali Al Assam (managing director of KnowledgeView Ltd) was easy enough to nab, and even willing to forego his coffee break to have a chat. And so, we headed to a round table with lunch places laid out. Moving aside cutlery and serviettes shaped like standing triangles, Dr Ali began telling the story of his association with Apple, the time he met Steve Jobs, the early days of graphics, and what to his mind, is the next big revolution in technology. Can you talk about the beginning? How did your dealings with Apple start? We developed Arabic for Apple 2 and Apple made a deal with us, by which they would distribute our Arabisation kit in the Middle East from 1982 to '84. In the Middle East, there was virtually no Arabic on computers. It was very early days - there were no graphics. This was 1984? Apple called me in. yes, I think, it was 1984. They said, we have a secret project in America. Will you come and help us with it? I was based in London then. So I went there. This is where I met Steve Jobs briefly. They had a secret project in another building. We didn't know how it looked. Apple had a Lisa (computer) that had a mouse and graphics. Steve Jobs and Apple borrowed the ideas from Xerox at the time. The Mac was a small box. But we had simulation on it. And they said, we'd like your help with doing fonts on this Mac in Arabic. In the Middle East, when Apple was releasing this Mac (we didn't know the name, we just knew something revolutionary was going to come). They were producing all the Eastern fonts. Apple was the first US manufacturer. (It was the) vision of Steve Jobs to say, look we are international, it has to be Kanji, Indian, Chinese, Arabic, and it all must look really beautiful... characters appeared in green, very ugly, very small, no graphics, on a black screen. That was a reality then. So, what he was producing was really revolutionary. Now you could see fantastic type on the screen - big small, really revolutionary.   How many fonts did you work on for the Mac? And how long did it take? When they were releasing this Mac on the Arabic world, they wanted an application on it to develop four fonts. I stayed with them for a few weeks in Cupertino in the headquarters... kept going and coming between London and Cupertino. I must have gone a year before that, actually. 1983. We launched it near Tower Bridge in a hotel together. They launched the Mac and we launched our desktop software on it. It was a joint launch between us an Apple. We did four fonts. Geeza, the application font is now on every iPhone. We did Geeza, Kufi, Damascus and Baghdad. To do the fonts, the first one took 2 months. Giza took 2 months, and the others took another few months each. But within the first year there were all there. Apple licensed it from us, for a very small price. It was fantastic then. Only a few thousand for it. Do you feel bad? At the small price? (laughs)Well, of course. But not really, that's life. When they produced the iPhone and Apple and other devices, all the fonts were all there. And back then, did you imagine the company (Apple) would become so big? No, of course not. We were Apple fans, and Apple had its fans (even then). During Steve Jobs's time, it was like a religion. People were really mad about anything that came from Apple. Nobody imagined there would be an Internet. Nobody thought there would be billions of Macs.   And your font; it's still there? So it's been timeless? Yes, timeless. The font is in vector, standard. It's still there. Probably Apple am sure has tweaked it technically but they haven't changed its look. It looks exactly the same.   You met Steve Jobs. What was that like? Oh. It was for few minutes only.   Was he wearing a black sweater? No, that came later. He had long hair then. His religious phase in India... Yes, his religious phase taught him about simplicity. He was just another man, the head of Apple. At the time he was important but not like later of course. I didn't tell people about it (the meeting). So nothing that stands out? No, not really. Someone introduced us. We met like oi, oi, this is Steve Jobs, this is Ali, he's doing Arabic fonts, oh yes, hello how are you, and you move along. When the Mac came out, I didn't see him after that.   And Diwan? Is that another font? Diwan was the company that produced the fonts and Arabic. We created it as a NFP. From 84-95 it was Non For Profit. And then all Arabic newspaper used our software. At the time, Diwan was the one publishing software in the Arab world. We had no competition. Microsoft didn't even produce Arabic at the time. We didn't think it would be the success it was. There were no shareholdings. We were the only ones. All the newspapers had to come to us. Diwan disappeared in '95 and I created knowledge view. And now we have this alliance with PPI media working in the Middle East.   What happened after Steve Jobs left? What happened with Steve Jobs. different things happened. (For one) Microsoft became big. Steve Jobs was evicted from Apple and Apple started going down. Industry observers were saying, 'when is Apple going to disappear?' They were counting the days for it to go bankrupt. Then they called Steve back and he revived it again with his genius and so on. Apple was going down. We did not have the dominance, but we were still influential. We started taking 60 per cent of the market again with Arabic newspapers.   How do you think Apple is doing under Tim Cook? Well, under Tim Cook, it's doing quite well. Some people say Steve Jobs's innovations have a five-years span. You don't know where the next revolution is going to be. People would say he's dictatorial and so on, but he wasn't. I mean, he was tough. But he managed to create a management class, a culture of innovation. And that management class continued to succeed when he was gone. He allowed a company to be innovative. You need a different type of leadership (for that).   Your prediction for the next big innovation? My prediction is that in the next two years, there's going to be the next big innovation. Just follow Apple's patents, then you can guess. Whether it has Steve Jobs's vision, you don't know. He was really quite visionary. Not a saint or a god. But he said the iPad would never be important. And his focus was in the iPhone. And then the iPad became very important. He said he would never do a big screen like the iPad, but tablets are going down. The mobile is the most important one. This mobile is a super computer. (It has the) processing power of a super computer 20 years ago. It's imprisoned in this little device.   Any innovations in terms of fonts coming up, you think? I don't think there will be a particular innovation in terms of fonts because now it's a universal approach for all fonts and languages. There are innovations in fonts, but these are no longer needed - you can break the glyphs of any part. The aleph, the ain, the noon, ta. they're composed of the same components. Memory used to be expensive and limited. So we experimented with breaking glyphs of a character. Sub components of a character. But now memory is very cheap. So there's no need. Now, innovation is text-to-speech, speech to text for when people communicate, they can use their voice.   Can you talk a bit about the font you created, Geeza? We created 4 fonts, still a part of the Apple library. They had an application font and a system font. Geeza. I know Geeza. I chose the name. So there was a classic Arabic font called Yakout, by Linotype. After 30 years, you lose the copyright. Yakout was all curvy like this. And Macintosh resolution wasn't nice. So I corrected it, made it more straight (sic). We wanted it to have some kind of fixed font. What I did with Yakout, I made it more straight, with monospace and proportional. Geeza is straight. But if you compare Geeza with Yakout, they have common characteristics. Geeza caters for limited resolution of the Macintosh screen. So Geeza was very successful. And you have relations with Apple now? Not as strong as before. People have changed. Before we were very, very close. The director of fonts in Linotype now is Arabic. she's Lebanese. Nadine Chahine... I don't know her. One of the greatest designers I worked with for many years was Mohamamd Sagar, who passed away in Paris a couple of years ago.He's the one who broke the Arabic characters in bits. Character matrix 8 by 16. Sagar helped me create these characters that were 8 and 16 matrix. In some points, the Arabic is really fantastic in design -you have the square Kufi that is square pixels. it's fantastic I don't know if you're following the evolution of type design... I have changed my focus to knowledge system. we call them news social, how people can co-operate, discuss things and reach conclusions in a social environment. But of course I am still very much attached to it. Some of my best friends are still designers. I don't know if you know Ishi Kuno? He designed most of the designs in Japanese for Microsoft, If you go to London, the underground has to be very clear, and that's Ishi Kuno's design. Also, Aurobin Patel. Aurobindo Patel? He was with The Economist. Aurobin and Ishi are not Arabic but they are very much interested in Arabic types. Sometimes we meet in the Middle East and go cycling together... Aurobin is the one who created this logo for me (the company logo). That was 1995. We were in his house. He said what about this? (Laughs). I've used it since then. He still advises Indian Newspapers on design. Aurbon Patel designed New Times Roman. And became font of The Times. And it's become a revolutionary font. What are the challenge for multi-language media? Arabic is more horizontal. But the rhythm of reading Latin is vertical. And you need to make a match. The graphic solution at the end must look similar. As you said, the origin is completely different. Isn't that a challenge? Yes. We assume Arabic has a single base line. One of the challenges we face later on is how to create a font that has a single base line. My colleagues continued on it. Calligraphers in Iraq, Diwan in Iraq, they started working on the baseline and created some very nice fonts. You need it for the Koran as well. More sophisticated fonts. Is smartphone reading is going to have an impact on fonts? Are we going to see more Sans Serif? What are we going to see? People are going to appreciate (fonts) more, absolutely. The technology for display has improved. It's given the designer much more freedom. Choice is much higher and you can do so much more with it. Which are your favourite fonts? Do you pick newspapers and books based on fonts? Personally, I like Monotype Lotus, one of the classic Arabic font. And it's a very old font by Monotype. I think it's still one of the best fonts available. Linotype used to be a very good company. Now they have reduced. They still have a very good library of fonts, including this Lotus one. You could get it. So when you type an email what font do you use? I use the Macintosh. And it is the application I have done. It's Geeza. It's the one I use. This is the application font in Macintosh. When I write a new email in Arabic and I switch to Arabic . (shows phone screen). yea, this is Geeza, this is the font I created. This is the standard application font. You can see it. This is the one. Ali, do you have feelings when you write in your own font? Not really. I feel comfortable with it (laughs) Well, I made it straight for a reason. But actually I prefer it to be a bit bendy. Maybe you could do a new version. Yes. It is based on Yakout font. You could get it from Linotype... Geeza is a really very successful font, simpler, very clear, even in high resolution, and the like it. Readability is very nice, especially on mobile.  We designed it to look good on lower resolution. My eyesight may not be good, but I can read it still. Which are the fonts you don't like? Oh, there are lots of ugly fonts. There is one called Wakawi - horrible. There is one called Al Harf Al Jadid. It's terrible I think. In my view, that is. Other people will like it very much. Do fonts tell the story of culture? Absolutely, yes. Yes. How much does culture influence fonts? A lot. Because the dominant culture is the Islamic culture. And Islamic culture had a tremendous influence on fonts. It tells a story. People in the old days weren't allowed to have pictures and drawings. So to express beauty, you expressed it in fonts. It's a way of expressing things you couldn't express otherwise. So, you're saying probably Arabic has more reflection of culture than the Roman fonts, the Latin fonts. Are you saying that? Not necessarily. We don't know about other cultures. But if you look at the Chinese and the Kanji and so on, their glyphs are very beautiful. I think they do more with fonts than Arabic, different approaches. Is the influence of culture dying out with technology coming in? Not really, no. It makes it flourish. Because technology makes it possible to express better. So it makes type more important than before. Absolutely, yes. Technology is really enabler for producing more beautiful type, and to do more with it than what you do with it. Before it was very limited.. This is humanity's biggest invention, writing. It's going to remain with us for a few thousand years. Have fonts the ability to get people back to reading? It can. Yes. It's only the beginning. Very important question, this. Technology enables reading and fonts. Makes it exciting for children to read and write. There is tremendous scope going forward, with education, writing and reading communicating better. Fonts are more of the future than of the past, don't you think? It's an essential part of communication. And very much part of art and so on, in all languages. Even in Roman. You can do more with glyphs, you can do more with type. Displays logos done with simple fonts. Royal Society of Arts Logo, it says in just English, but the font is the design, the text is design. With simplicity, you can get excellent design. nivriti@khaleejtimes.com Share More > Vote MORE FROM Technology Technology Ali is for Apple: He designed the first Arabic...

Wikileaks on Thursday released documents, originated with the CIA, which detailed methods for compromising Apple devices if an agent was able to gain physical access to the device, TechCrunch reported. "We have preliminarily assessed the Wikileaks disclosures from this morning. Based on our initial analysis, the alleged iPhone vulnerability affected iPhone 3G only and was fixed in 2009 when iPhone 3GS was released," Apple said in a statement. "Additionally, our preliminary assessment shows the alleged Mac vulnerabilities were previously fixed in all Macs launched after 2013," the company added. Nicknamed "Vault 7," Wikileaks' newest archive of documents is the second in a series of documents allegedly taken from a secure CIA network. "We have not negotiated with Wikileaks for any information. We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn't in the public domain," the Apple statement read. "We are tireless defenders of our users' security and privacy, but we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users," the tech giant added. Earlier, after a hacker or group of hackers threatened to remotely wipe data from millions of iPhones including photos, videos and messages, Apple denied any such breach into iPhones. The hackers, who call themselves 'Turkish Crime Family', asked for $75,000 in Bitcoin or Ethereum (a form of crypto-currency) or $100,000 worth of iTunes gift cards in exchange for deleting a large cache of iCloud and other Apple email accounts, Vice blog Motherboard reported. Reacting to the threat, Apple told Fortune: "There have not been any breaches in any of Apple's systems including iCloud and Apple ID. The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services." The hackers claimed to have access to nearly 559 million Apple email and iCloud accounts. The hackers provided screenshots of alleged emails between the group and members of Apple's security team and threatened to reset iCloud accounts and remotely wipe victim's Apple devices on April 7 unless Apple pays them. The Apple spokesperson, however, said that Apple is "actively monitoring to prevent unauthorised access to user accounts and are working with law enforcement to identify the criminals involved."

The company is reportedly all set to kick off manufacturing at Wistron’s Bengaluru plant within the next 4 to 6 weeks. A government official told the Wall Street Journal that the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S would be the first to be produced. The two are supposedly going to be followed up by the iPhone SE 3 months down the line. This goes against a previous rumor which alleged that the 4-incher would be the first out of the gate. The official also claims that almost all preparations have been completed for starting Apple’s first phase project in Bengaluru. The main obstacle in its path appears to be the Indian government. Trade Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently told legislators that the administration hasn’t accepted most of the demands laid down by the company.

Another official who works closely with Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that India would try to accommodate as much of Apple’s requests as possible, but that it too would appreciate and understand their limitations. Apple is apparently still moving ahead with the next step in its manufacturing plans. This could see it bring more suppliers to make parts and export finished iPhones. All units are currently manufactured and exported only from China. Analysts say that the locally produced iPhones sold in the country could be $100 cheaper than before since import tariffs won’t be a factor in calculating price. Apple’s also been holding talks to open wholly-owned stores in India, something which it’s been working towards for quite a while now.

That's despite assurances from Apple to customers that their servers are safe. The London-based group - who identify themselves as the 'Turkish Crime Family' - has also upped its ransom demands from $75,000 (£60,000) to $700,000 (£560,000). Scroll down for video  A London-based hacking group who identified themselves as the Turkish Crime Family have demanded $700,000 (£560,000) from Apple. If their demands are not met, they have threatened to erase the contents of iCloud accounts and remotely wipe iPhones WHAT TO DO  If you are worried about your account's security, changing your password is the first step you should take. You should ensure that this is not a password you have used before for other online services.  It should also be a random mix of numbers, letters and special characters. It should preferably not contain full words or anything personal to you - for instance your place or date of birth. You can also change your recovery questions.  Two-factor authentication will also make it harder for hackers to compromise your account. Apple's help questions can give you a step-by-step guide on how to do this. Turkish Crime Family (TCF) says it has verified at least 200 million users will be affected by the attack. But it claims many more are likely to be caught up in cyber operation, which is planned for April 7. TCF also claims that a former member of the group incorrectly demanded a total of $75,000 for the heist from Apple. Each of the seven remaining members now want $100,000 - almost ten times the figure originally reported. A spokesman for TCFA said in a statement  posted on the website Pastebin: 'Apple has now announced that they were not breached, which no one claimed they were. 'They announced this for their user's comfort and to make them feel better. 'Out of the 750 million (accounts), we have 250 million that are checked and working live, there is still a big amount that we're still scanning. 'We are still strengthening our infrastructure and acquiring more servers for the attack.'  While the group's ability to access some accounts has been established, how far this extends is still a mystery. But some experts believe that the group is an amateur operation which is out of its depth. Technology experts at ZDNet contacted a number of users whose passwords and account details were provided to them by TCF.

Share this article Share 118 shares They confirmed that the data was indeed correct, and that in one case the password had never been used on another site. But the report's authors concluded that TCF 's main aim was publicity. In an article on the site, they said: 'Based on our experience and our interactions with the group and its members, it's evident that the group is naïve and inexperienced. Turkish Crime Family say they have verified at least 200 million users will be affected by the attack. But they claim many more are likely to be caught up in cyber operation, which is planned for April 7 'Based on its grandiose claims and its cherry-picking media outlets to cover its claims, it's clear that the group is gunning for publicity.  'When we began asking the group questions, the conversation quickly turned to whether or not if CBS News (which like ZDNet is also owned by CBS), would also cover the group's claims.' It is not exactly clear how the group acquired the sensitive data. But a statement by Apple confirmed one widely-held assumption - that the data may have been obtained from other sites whose data has been breached. Both Yahoo and LinkedIn are among a number of high profile sites which have been hacked in recent months. A statement by Apple said that their servers are safe and suggested that the data may have been obtained from other sites whose data has been breached (Stock Image) Speaking to Fortune on Wednesday, an Apple spokesman said: 'There have not been any breaches in any of Apple's systems including iCloud and Apple ID. 'The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services.'  News of the attack first broke when the hackers previously demanded $75,000 (£60,000) in the crypto-currencies Bitcoin or Ethereum. Alternatively, they said they were willing to accept $100,000 (£80,000) worth of iTunes gift cards. In exchange, they assure Apple they would delete the data which they say would allow them to erase the contents of the iCloud accounts, as well as remotely wiping iPhones.  Read more: iCloud breach allegations - Pastebin.com Hackers: We Will Remotely Wipe iPhones Unless Apple Pays Ransom - Motherboard iCloud: Change your iCloud password Proactive Firewall Management & Security - FireMon Apple: Hackers Threaten to Wipe Millions of iPhones | Fortune.com Apple iCloud ransom demands: The facts you need to know | ZDNet Share or comment on this article e-mail 118 shares Most watched News videos Dead man is cut out of the stomach of a seven metre long PYTHON Monkman gets the better of Seagull in University Challenge semi-final Shocking moment a driver is punched through his car window Driver's hilarious attempt to squeeze car through tight gap Maid caught on camera appearing to be POSSESSED by evil spirits Furious cyclist smashes driver's windscreen with his own bike Mother films invasive TSA pat-down of her disabled teenage son Brazen man catches huge COBRA out of hole with his bare hands Dad confronts policewoman who confiscated daffodils from daughters UNC's Luke Maye goes to his 8AM class after beating Kentucky Dramatic moment a car is struck by lightning as it drives down road Shocking carer steals money out of dementia patient's handbag Horrifying moment villagers cut open a giant python and...

The documents released by the anti-secrecy site Thursday morning pointed to an apparent CIA program to hack Apple devices using techniques that users couldn't disable by resetting their devices. The iPhone hack was limited to the 3G model from 2008. In a statement late Thursday, Apple said the flaw was fixed with the release of the iPhone 3GS a year later. Apple also said the Mac vulnerabilities were all fixed in all Macs launched after 2013. WikiLeaks Says It'll Work With Tech Firms to Defeat CIA Hacking Apple's statement was consistent with assessments from security experts, who say that many of the apparent vulnerabilities were in older technology. Apple is going further in saying those flaws have all been fixed, based on its preliminary analysis. Security experts say the exploits described in the WikiLeaks documents are plausible, but suggest they pose little threat to typical users. Besides being likely out of date, the techniques also typically require physical access to devices, something the CIA would use only for targeted individuals, not a broader population. The CIA has not commented on the authenticity of this and earlier WikiLeaks revelations, but has previously said it complies with a legal prohibition against electronic surveillance "targeting individuals here at home, including our fellow Americans." The leaks Thursday came about two weeks after WikiLeaks published thousands of alleged CIA documents describing hacking tools it said the government employed to break into computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs from companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. WikiLeaks has offered to share further details with tech companies to help them fix flaws, though accepting such information might subject companies to certain conditions and put government contracts at risk. Wikileaks CIA Files: 5 Things We Learnt About Gadgets That Spy on You Apple addressed the offer for the first time in Thursday's statement. "We have not negotiated with WikiLeaks for any information," the statement read. "We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn't in the public domain." Apple said that while it takes users' security and privacy seriously, "we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users." Earlier, Microsoft said WikiLeaks had made initial contact through its public reporting channel, "and we have followed up, treating them as we would any other finder."

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Top 5 smartwatches that will make you look classy and adventurous Here's is list top 5 smartwatches that not only offer visually appealing traditional circular design language, but also high-tech features, as well. Rohit KVN   March 24, 2017 18:16 IST [Representational Image] Top 5 smartwatches that will make you look class apart from just geek In Picture: SmartwatchesGoogle Blog Owing to lack of breakthrough innovations in smartphones, mobile-makers came up with digital watches with touch-sensitive screens and it became an instant hit among consumers. Samsung, Apple, Motorola, LG all launched their own smart wearables to cash-in on the craze. But, within a span of three years, the fad for smartwatches was beginning to fade; most probably, due to lack of creative design language. Also, most smartwatches had less value-added features, which only attracted niche tech-savvy users. However, things are beginning to change for good in the smartwatch industry with the entry of traditional Swiss timepiece-maker Tag Heuer and also digital watch pioneer Casio, who recently launched a new line of smart wristwatches with great design and a slew of cool features ranging from fitness to outdoor trekking, voice-search on Google and more, which we believe will definitely re-invigorate this industry and also attract more people. Also read: Samsung Galaxy S8 news: Target tipped to offer enticing gifts with Galaxy S7 successor in US; pre-order details revealed Here we have listed top five feature-rich smartwatches that will make you look classy and adventurous. Casio Edifice EQB501: The new Casio Edifice EQB501 series is unarguably the best looking wristwatch out there. It ticks all the three key aspects we expect in a smartwatch — visually appealing design language, wide functional capabilities and the most important, wireless mobile connectivity. With Casio Watch+ mobile app, Edifice EQB501 series owners, besides doing normal things like viewing current time, manage daylight saving time, stopwatch, alarm, sync with multiple timezones, can use it to track phone (compatible with Apple iOS and Google Android mobiles), and also view speed indicator, as well. It comes in a traditional circular dial design and is made of tough and rugged metal case, which is capable of surviving close to 100 meters underwater, as well. Casio Edifice EQB501Edifice official page (screen-shot) The most interesting aspect of the Casio's new watch is that it does not require electric charging. Edifice EQB501 series comes with a advanced rechargeable battery, which takes power directly from Sun solar energy drawn via Tough Solar glass panel on the dial. It is said to boast shadow-dispersing solar panel with excellent power-generation efficiency. It is set to go on sale next month, but price details are yet to be announced. Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45: Switzerland-based Tag Heuer, which has been in the watch making business for more than 150 years, has embraced digital age with élan. It's newly launched Connected Modular 45 is poised to take on first generation smartwatch-makers. Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 offers both, the traditional look and also high-tech features, which will certainly please all age groups. Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45Tag Heuer official page (screen-shot) As the name suggests, it takes customisation to a whole new level. Tag Heuer is offering the watch 56 different styles with numerous choices in terms of straps, lugs and buckles, case materials and settings, including a diamond-set option, satin and polished Grade-5 Titanium modules. It also allows owners to switch between connected and mechanical modules, which no other watch-makers offer at this moment. It can also survive 50 meters underwater and runs on Android Wear 2.0 with Google Assistant support powered by Intel Atom Z34XX chipset, has 4GB internal storage, offers 29 hours of active power. It sports 1.39-inch super AMOLED screen with 2.5D Sapphire cover glass. Others features include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and NFC (Near Field Communication). Note: Tag Heuer Modular 45 also supports Apple iOS, as well.] Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45Tag Heuer official page (screen-shot) With so much features tucked in to the small confines of the watch, Tag Heuer Modular 45 does not come cheap. Its base model costs a $1,650 and depending on the type of material used in the making of watch module case and customisation option chosen by the consumer, it will go up to a whopping $18,850. Garmin Fenix 5X: Garmin Fenix 5X is the most rugged smartwatch in our list. Its screen is made of sapphire crystal with high-resolution, full-color Garmin Chroma Display having LED backlighting, which offers optimized viewing experience at any light conditions even under direct sunlight. Its bezel is made of super sturdy PVD-coated stainless steel and the reinforced buttons on the contours guarantees extra durability. Consumers can opt for either metal or silicon based straps. It is capable of sustaining dense water pressure up to 100 meters. Garmin Fenix 5XGarmin official page (screen-shot) It boasts proprietary Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate monitor and also come with dedicated navigation sensors including GLONASS and GPS to track running, which will be beneficial for fitness maintenance. It's on-watch mapping and navigation features will definitely attract trekking enthusiasts. Like Casio Edifice EQB501, it connects with smartphone both Apple iPhones and Google Android mobiles through application Garmin Connect (via Wi-Fi). Garmin Fenix 5X houses lithium ion cell, which offers battery life up to 12 days in smartwatch mode (depending on settings), up to 20 hours in GPS mode, and up to 50 hours in UltraTrac battery saver mode. Depending on the type of straps, consumers will have to shell out between $649.99 and $849.99 to buy Garmin Fenic 5X. Though, the price is expensive, it's worth every penny. Samsung Gear S3 Frontier: Gear S3 comes in two models -- classic and frontier, which is a rugged variant for outdoors. They house almost the same hardware, but differ in a few aspects. We recommend the latter, as it boasts additional features such as LTE support and built-in speakers, wherein users can activate voice messaging and listen to their favorite tunes. And also, the Frontier model features rugged exterior design, best suited for people who love trekking. It sports a 1.3-inch circular super AMOLED display with AOD (Always-On-Display) feature and IP68 water-and-dust resistant certification. Under the hood, it houses 1.0GHz dual-core processor, 768MB RAM and 4GB inbuilt storage. Samsung Gear S3 Frontier seriesSamsung Mobile (Official) Website Samsung Gear S3 series also boasts Heart Rate Monitor and 380mAh battery, which can keep the device running for close to four days. The Gear S3 series also features NFC (Near Field Communication) and MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission), thus paving way for cash-less transaction via Samsung Pay. Another notable aspect of the Gear S3 series is its safety feature. Users can activate SOS and location tracking capabilities to alert family, friends and emergency professionals when facing dire situation. LG Watch Sport: The new LG Watch Sport is the best smartwatch from the South Korea to date. It looks stunning with premium metallic build and traditional round contoured design language. It's not just an eye candy, Watch Sport, as the name suggests, is rugged and is capable to survive the underwater dive. It boasts IP68 water-and-dust resistant certification. LG Watch SportLG official page (screen-shot) It sports a 1.2-inch AMOLED display panel with 430×480p resolution having Gorilla Glass 3 shield and comes with Android Wear OS 2.0, sumptuous 768MG RAM, 4GB internal storage, LTE connectivity with SIM tray, built-in GPS for fitness tracking, Snapdragon Wear 2100, optical heart rate monitor, NFC (Near Field Communication) with contact-less Android Pay support, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and a massive 420mAh battery. It costs $349 (approx. €323/Rs. 22824).

Share Tweet Is Apple building an iPhone-powered laptop? Apple is not the first compan­y to try to use a smartp­hone to power a comput­er By Tech Desk Published: March 24, 2017 0SHARES Share Tweet Email Apple’s application points towards an accessory that looks like a traditional clamshell laptop with an iPhone-sized slot at a place where usually touchpad is located. PHOTO COURTESY: APPLEINSIDER A patent application filed in the US by the tech giant Apple revealed on Thursday hints at an iPhone or iPod-powered laptop. Apple’s application, which was filed in September, for “Electronic accessory device” points towards an accessory that looks like a traditional clamshell laptop with an iPhone-sized slot at a place where the touchpad is usually located. The device described in the application looks like a kind of “headless” device containing a large display, physical keyboard, GPU, ports and more, just like a regular laptop. From the application, it seems that it is incapable of functioning without a host. The casing would be using an iPhone or iPad that would fit into the laptop-esque piece of kit to handle the processing, filling in the role of CPU. Apple launches its cheapest-ever iPad The slot, which is located in the base portion, might also incorporate a communications interface and a means of power transfer, perhaps Lightning or a Smart Connector. Additionally, the host device might also act as a multitouch touchpad, complete with Force Touch input and haptic feedback. It is pertinent to mention here that the surface area of a 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus is very similar to that of the trackpad on Apple’s new MacBook Pro models. Will Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone cost over $1,000? Further, the patent application also includes a design in which the screen is replaced with an iPad. Although the latest iPad Pro models can be used with an optional keyboard, they currently lack a touchpad. Apple is not the first company to try to use a smartphone to power a computer. In 2011, tried something similar with Atrix 4G. However, in Motorola’s version, the device was on docked on the back of the laptop, rendering users unable to utilise the phone’s touch as a second screen. In fact back in 2004, Apple itself filed for a similar patent for a media player system, which includes various ways to dock an iPod including a laptop and an iMac.

I urge this paper to make it more Urdu section where using vector font technology (not scan), please develop Urdu literature, with more Arabic grammar and Persian grammar sentence structure incorporated to develop a scientific literature in Urdu. The seminal reason I urge arabic/farsi is because these two languages are more succinct than Urdu. Just count the number of words for a simple sentence, “This is my book.” in Urdu and compare it to Arabic, Haza Kitabi, and Persian, Ain Kitab Man Ast. In some places one is more compact. We find that Urdu is more verbose and it can be empowered by Arabic and Farsi besides giving window to our past literature in both these languages. Also, in addition to patents, do a regular review of scientific and manufacturing literature of the world to bring value to readers.Recommend MORE Leave Your Reply Below Click here to cancel reply.

Back in 2015, the company was awarded 1,938 patents in the US alone. While majority of these patents just lay in slumber, some of them are still quite interesting. For instance, a new one that was filed by Apple dreams of extending the functionalities of the iPhone and the iPad. According to the US Patent Office, Apple recently filed an unusual patent that turns an iPhone or an iPad into a sort of laptop. This patent showed how the contraption will add more functionalities to the devices in many ways. In the said patent, it can be seen that the device in question has a slot fit for a mobile device. In addition to the slot, the device also has a keyboard and a display. An iPhone can be place in the slot to function as a trackpad. Also, the device’s built-in display will extend the display of the iPhone. Basically, the device is some sort of a laptop extension for the iPhone. Apple patent for the iPhone (via uspto.gov) Another part of the patent involves an iPad. In this case, the iPad is placed on where the screen should be. Like the first device mentioned, this version also makes for a rudimentary laptop with the use of an iPad. While this one is not really new, as many third-party providers sell keyboard covers for the iPad, it still is quite neat. Also, Apple envisions to have a discrete GPU and extra battery built into both of the contraptions. This will further enhance the usability of the device and the iPad or iPhone connected with it. Apple patent for the iPad (via uspto.gov) Unfortunately, like any other patent from Apple, this too might not even see the light of day. The company sometimes files patents just for the sake of it. However, one cannot deny that the iPhone contraption is a pretty novel idea. Although the same cannot be said for the iPad version. For more tech updates, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Programmers Are Racing to Save Apple II Software Before It Goes Extinct We're living in a golden age of Apple II preservation. As technology evolves and each new gadget usurps the last, devices exist in a protracted twilight when their software and hardware can be preserved before they're lost forever. The Apple II, the computer released in 1977 that made the Steves (Jobs and Wozniak) famous multi-millionaires, is in its twilight. Now, a group of crackers are working together to save every Apple II program possible—there's tens of thousands floating around—before the proper hardware no longer exists or the floppy disks lose their magnetic charge and their data. They have the machinery, and they've coded their own software; for the first time, cracking the anti-piracy protections on Apple II software and copying it exactly is downright easy. According to archivist Jason Scott, who works for the Internet Archive, we're unlikely to see such a confluence of circumstances again. So, he's heading up a call-out for anyone and everyone to physically send him their old Apple II floppies so they can be preserved and uploaded to the Archive for all to enjoy with the site's emulator. (If you have any or know of a stash, email apple@textfiles.com.) This is necessary now, Scott said when I spoke to him, because many of the Apple II programs that have already been preserved aren't the originals. Apple II programs had some intense anti-piracy measures—basically tripwires made of code—and so old-school crackers would snip out code to make the programs work. Now, we have the ability to make exact, byte-by-byte copies of original software. Read More: The Original Net Artists "The big titles are available in some form, even if they're not pristine and original," Scott said. "But it seems a shame to not leverage this opportunity to get better versions, and to get a clearer view, and do a bit more work." The leaked and cracked version of some Apple II games, like Ballblazer, were as popular as the official releases, Scott said, meaning most folks might have never experienced the "real" version of the game. There's also reams of educational software, locked down with insanely overwrought anti-piracy protections, that have never been given any love. "The holy grail is someone whose dad ran a software store, and then just shoved everything in a barn once it closed," Scott said. "I'd love to get my hands on that." The key to the project is software written by pseudonymous Apple II cracker "4AM" called Passport. Passport is an easy way to copy unprotected Apple II programs, and some that are. But when Scott comes across a disk that's particularly difficult, he hands it over to 4AM. 4AM has written his own program in assembly language—code that interfaces directly with a device's hardware—to "silent crack" programs. This means that every byte is preserved, without any modifications from the cracker. The end result is a .zip file that can be loaded into an emulator on any PC. Over the last few decades, emulating the Apple II has matured to the point of replicating the original machine's quirky CPU cycles. Some emulators even attempt to replicate the fuzzy warmth of an old CRT monitor with a modern and crystal-clear LED screen. Scott and the anonymous crackers he's working this are just starting out—he's been sent dozens of boxes already—and the road will likely be long and incredibly tedious. They also have no official support from Apple itself. But the work is incredibly rewarding already, he said, and will benefit a future generations of nerds brave or stubborn enough to pick up the baton. "We're not the end-piece," Scott said. "We'll do all this work, and then we'll die, and then some 22-year-old Italian kid is going to put it all together and make a perfect archive."

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Adam Patrick Murray More like this What the Mac needs in 2017 The 10 must-have utilities for macOS Sierra Inside Leopard: Safari and Automator Video Watch SwapBots spring to life thanks to augmented reality After this week’s news that Apple had acquired iOS power user app Workflow, you’d be excused for being a bit confused about the future of automation on Apple’s platform. After all, it was just last November that Sal Soghoian, Apple’s product manager of automation technologies, left the company when his position was eliminated. And yet, Apple snapped up Workflow, an app that many had compared to Apple’s own Automator, which was introduced way back in 2005’s Mac OS X Tiger. So what gives? Is there still some life in automation and scripting features on Apple’s platforms, or is this merely a case of Apple acquiring useful talent? Follow the script Scripting’s been part of the Mac since the earliest days. AppleScript, which grew out of HyperCard’s HyperTalk scripting language, was built into System 7 back in 1993. It was a way to automate complex tasks across multiple applications, and it had a lot of power thanks not only to its deep integration into the OS, but also to third-party developers who made their apps addressable by the scripting language. But for all its power, AppleScript has always been a bit esoteric. While it was intended to be accessible and used a sort of natural English syntax, it was often still too complex for the average user. On the other end, those used to more traditional programming languages found its idiosyncrasies equally baffling. When AppleScript found its way into OS X—if anecdotal accounts are to be believed, almost entirely thanks to the willpower of Soghoian—it laid the groundwork for Automator, a graphical and more user-friendly attempt to handle the kind of tasks AppleScript had. But Automator never quite managed to live up to its potential. In many cases, one had to fall back on AppleScript or UNIX shell scripts to accomplish some functions, and its graphical interface still wasn’t enough make it friendly to most mainstream users. But as computers became more mature and powerful, there wasn’t always the same need for automation and scripting as there had been back in the early days when many users needed to also be part programmer to get things done. Many tasks that had once been automated could now be handled by applications created by Apple or third parties. Though both AppleScript and Automation stuck around in subsequent releases of OS X, neither got any real attention from Apple. Workflow on iOS A few years after Automation’s introduction, the iPhone showed up with no automation capabilities whatsoever. Though many parts of OS X made the jump to the platform, AppleScript and Automator were left behind. Almost 10 years later, that situation hasn’t changed. It was just in 2014 that apps even got the ability to communicate with one another. Enter Workflow, an app that is, on the surface, very similar to Automator, providing a graphical interface with which to automate complex tasks across apps and services. But the kicker is that it pulled all this functionality off without Apple’s help. While some have embraced Workflow’s power, it’s suffered from the same challenges that Automator has encountered on the Mac. Most users either don’t have or haven’t identified a need for automation, and for the fraction that have, only another fraction go through the trouble of finding and learning to use a tool like Workflow. Will the future be automated? All of which makes Apple’s acquisition of Workflow even more puzzling. The easy answer, of course, is that Apple was impressed with the resourcefulness of the development team and wanted to hire them. In the long term, that will probably mean shutting down Workflow. I’m not convinced, though, in part because Workflow provides useful features that aren’t available anywhere else. (And Apple’s first move was to make the app free, which could be a sign they plan to keep it around.) That could be a compelling enough argument for Apple to make use of the app’s capabilities itself. Why reinvent the wheel if the company is interested in bringing automation to iOS? And, frankly, it should be. Even with the addition of app extensions in iOS 8, inter-app communication has remained a weak point. Why not bring Workflow to the Mac? Well maybe because at its more mature age, it isn’t crying out for automation in the same way. AppleScript and Automator are still there, after all, and while they might not get more useful as time goes by, neither has their functionality been snatched away. But let’s face it: iOS and the iPhone are the most prominent part of Apple’s identity these days, and what happens there sets the tone for the company. It’s a no-brainer that the company wants its products to get more powerful and useful, and Workflow’s capabilities might be one way to do that.

 Apple is downplaying the iCloud blackmail story — but Apple users should take it seriously James Cook Mar. 24, 2017, 9:26 AM 8,080 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook.AP Apple has downplayed reports that millions of leaked iCloud logins are in the hands of hackers who could use the information to steal personal information or wipe devices. But sample data seen by ZDNet shows that at least some of the data is valid login information. The blackmail story began on Tuesday, when Motherboard reported that a group calling itself "Turkish Crime Family" demanded $75,000 (£59,000) in either Bitcoin or Ethereum from Apple, or $100,000 (£79,000) in iTunes gift cards in return for deleting the iCloud user data it claimed to possess. Apple, however, released a statement denying that its servers had been hacked. Instead, it seems that the login information comes from the 2012 LinkedIn hack. Game over, right? Apple wasn't breached, so everything is fine? Well, not so much. Turkish Crime Family handed over sample data to ZDNet, which the publication verified as actual login information. The publication spoke to 10 people who verified their data. Despite the advice of security experts, many people re-use passwords over and over, meaning that if one of their accounts (apparently LinkedIn, in this case) is compromised, their others all become vulnerable too. So clearly people are at risk, even if it's not necessarily the millions of people that Turkish Crime Family claimed are affected. Apple, however, has only released one statement on the story, in which it denied it had been hacked, and said it is "actively monitoring to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and are working with law enforcement to identify the criminals involved." Contrast Apple's statement with the actions of Reddit and Twitter, which forced password resets on certain accounts after learning that login information for users had been posted online — even though the sites themselves hadn't been breached. Apple increased iCloud security in 2014 after celebrities had their private photos stolen and posted online using a weakness in iCloud accounts. It prompted users to use two-factor authentication, which requires a phone number to get into accounts. Encouraging users to change their passwords or to enable two-factor authentication now, in light of Turkish Crime Family's claims, could stop users having their accounts taken over or deleted. Apple said in its statement on the attempted blackmail that users should enable two-factor authentication for their accounts, but it has yet to email users or send notifications to their devices that their accounts could be at risk.

Police said the boy’s mother had collapsed and was unresponsive, but he managed to press her thumb to her phone’s home button to unlock it. In an audio clip of the call, released by the London Metropolitan Police on YouTube, the boy, identified as Roman, is heard telling dispatchers that his mother is dead. He follows their directions to try and revive her, before telling them his home address. Police said officers arrived at Roman’s house within 13 minutes and were able to provide first aid to his mother. They said she has been discharged from hospital and is back home. The police department also said that they released the audio of the emergency call to encourage parents to make their children memorise their home address for emergencies. tags Apple Siri London London Metropolitan Police more from world Two Indian-Americans sentenced for $200 million-credit card fraud in US Mar 28, 2017 09:59 IST How two teens in leggings became a PR mess for United Airlines Mar 28, 2017 09:08 IST FD vs Stocks: Which One Should You Choose?

Check out our latest reviews and buyer's guide on the top waterproof smartphones for this year. Waterpoof phones are ideal for the accident-prone By Chris Martin | 24 Mar 17 What's the best waterproof phone you can buy in the UK? Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Samsung Galaxy S7 iPhone 7 Sony Xperia XZ Sony Xperia Z5 Jump straight to our full best waterproof phones chart Your buying guide for the best waterproof phones in 2017 If you're accident-prone (or simply want to give your phone to a child without worrying they will drop it down the toilet or throw it into a pond) then a waterproof phone is a great purchase. Having one also means you can watch TV in the bath or take photos underwater. Also see: Best kids' phones 2017. Also see: Best Phone Deals Most Sony phones are waterproof unless you're buying lower-tier devices, and you can also get waterproof Samsung phones and even iPhones. Sadly the new Google Pixel phones are only splash-proof so don't make it into this list. HTC has finally launched a waterproof phone, the 10 Evo, so we'll add that once we've given it a full review. Also see: Best phones of 2017. The problem is that not all waterproof phones are created equal and different devices will offer different levels of protection. Some will be simply 'splash proof' while others can be fully dunked in water and continue to work. Because of this, we've explained the IP rating system which is used for electronics that feature dust- and water-protection. This chart only includes phones we've reviewed. Read: Best new phones coming in 2017. What IP ratings really mean IP stands for 'Ingress Protection' and is used to define the sealing effectiveness of electrical enclosures against intrusion from foreign bodies and moisture. The first number refers to how the device sealed against solid particles like dust; the highest you can get is '6' meaning total protection. The second digit is for water protection and the best you'll see on most is '8', going by the original IEC standard 60529 (6K and 9K are not part of this). It's worth noting that ratings water ingress are not cumulative beyond 6, so a device with a rating of 7 doesn't have to compliant with the water jet element of 5 and 6. If an IP rating has an X in it, don't misinterpret this as the device having no protection. It's likely to have good protection for particles if it's IPX6, but the rating has not been formally allocated. Here's a full listing for particles and water: Dust •    0 – No protection. •    1 – >50 mm, any large surface of the body, such as the back of a hand. •    2 – >12.5 mm, fingers or similar objects. •    3 – >2.5 mm, tools, thick wires, etc. •    4 – >1 mm, most wires, slender screws, large ants etc. •    5 – Dust protected, Ingress of dust is not entirely prevented. •    6 – Dust tight, No ingress of dust; complete protection against contact. A vacuum must be applied. Test duration of up to 8 hours based on air flow. Water •    0 – No protection. •    1 – Dripping water shall have no harmful effect. •    2 – Vertically dripping water shall have no harmful effect with enclosure is tilted at 15°. •    3 – Water falling as a spray at any angle up to 60° from the vertical. •    4 – Water splashing against the enclosure from any direction. •    5 – Water projected by a nozzle (6.3mm) against enclosure from any direction.  •    6 – Water projected in powerful jets (12.5mm nozzle) from any direction. •    6K – Powerful water jets with increased pressure. •    7 – Immersion, up to 1m depth for up to 30 minutes. •    8 – Immersion, 1m or more depth (exact details vary). •    9K – Powerful high temperature water jets. The next generation of waterproof phones According to IDC, liquid is the second most common cause of damage in smartphones accounting for 35.1% of all devices repaired. However, that might change considerably in 2018 thanks to a new generation of waterproof phones with better protection. At the moment, phone makers either use physical seals or a nano-coating to keep water out. While the latter is limited to splashes, P2i - a leader in the technology - is working on an improved version of its plasma protection which will be IPX7. A nano-coating to this level will give partners more freedom with design and could even mean we see more handsets with removable covers and batteries again. We certainly hope so. Best waterproof phones 2017 UK - best waterproof phone reviews 1. Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Rating: Reviewed on: 12 January 17 RRP: £639, US$780 Compare: all Samsung Galaxy S7 edge deals The Galaxy S7 edge is no longer the semi-gimmick it was before. Although some of the main features are things from the Galaxy S5 – Micro-SD and waterproofing – Samsung has given fans what they want. It's now a refined, sophisticated and highly desirable piece of technology. The battery isn't removable but the phone lasts longer than before and has seriously powerful specs under the hood. It has almost everything you could want from a phone even though the IR blaster is gone. We're also very impressed with the new camera and unless the screen is too big for you (despite some software features to help out) we think it's worth getting the S7 edge for the extra £70 with its gorgeous looks and extra functionality. Right now, this is the best smartphone money can buy. Read our Samsung Galaxy S7 edge review. 2. Samsung Galaxy S7 Rating: Reviewed on: 12 January 17 RRP: £569, US$670 Compare: all Samsung Galaxy S7 deals The Samsung Galaxy S6 was the best phone of 2015 and, although it’s still early days, the Galaxy S7 is a serious contender for best phone of 2016. Samsung has taken into account what its fans want, addressing the three main areas of concern: removable storage, waterproofing and battery life. It’s also upgraded the core hardware and photography gear, added an always-on display and some useful software. Right now the Galaxy S7 is simply unbeatable. Read our Samsung Galaxy S7 review. 3. Apple iPhone 7 Rating: Reviewed on: 21 March 17 RRP: £599 (32GB), £699 (128GB), £799 (256GB) Compare: all Apple iPhone 7 deals  The iPhone 7 is an evolution of the 6S, so if you were expecting a revolution you’ll probably be slightly disappointed. However, aside from the underwhelming battery life, it is an excellent phone. It’s waterproof, has fantastic cameras and performance, and the new stereo speakers sound great. There’s now 32GB of storage as a minimum, which helps to mitigate the higher prices. If you have an iPhone 6s, it’s hard to justify upgrading (even for some people with a 6) but if you’re out of contract and want a small phone, it’s the best Apple has made yet. Read our Apple iPhone 7 review. 4. Sony Xperia XZ Rating: Reviewed on: 31 October 16 RRP: £539, US$599 Compare: all Sony Xperia XZ deals The Xperia XZ is an attractive phone in design if you can get on with the angular style and while it's cheaper than rivals such as the iPhone 7 and Google Pixel, you can get better value with some older phones like the Samsung Galaxy S7. While the hardware is decent, we can't help but mention the very similar Xperia Z5 will save you a lot of money. Read our Sony Xperia XZ review. 5. Sony Xperia Z5 Rating: Reviewed on: 29 April 16 RRP: £549 There's no doubt that the Xperia Z5 is a solid flagship smartphone from Sony and an improvement on the Z3+. We certainly like the new frosted glass rear cover and the addition of a fingerprint scanner in that slim power button. The camera isn't great compared to the best phone cameras out there though, and you can get a better phone for similar money. The price has dropped, and it's now a decent-value waterproof flagship with a Micro-SD card slot. However, you can't use it underwater, and there are newer rivals which are better value, take better photos and have better performance. Read our Sony Xperia Z5 review. 6. Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Rating: Reviewed on: 22 October 15 RRP: £429 The Xperia Z5 Compact is the best small phone around, but then there's not much competition in this area anymore and there are a number of phones offering decent specs for a lot less. Those looking for Z5 design and specs in a smaller frame will be pleased but it's a shame about the chunky design with the sharp edges. The fingerprint scanner is a great addition and the Snapdragon 810 with almost stock Android provides slick performance. However, the camera isn't as good as Sony makes it out to be. Read our Sony Xperia Z5 Compact review. 7. Motorola Moto G (3rd gen) Rating: Reviewed on: 18 May 16 RRP: From £149 With various upgrades including a waterproof design, great cameras and stock Android, the new Moto G 2015 is a great affordable phone. The device is still a bit chunky and it's a shame to see the stereo speakers gone. It's worth opting for the model with 16GB of storage and 2GB of RAM. Now with a price cut to £149, the Moto G 3rd-gen is the best budget phone you can buy. Read our Motorola Moto G (3rd gen) review. 8. Sony Xperia M4 Aqua Rating: Reviewed on: 30 July 15 RRP: £230 The mid-range smartphone market is always tricky, especially with budget devices getting so good. If you are looking for something around this price, the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua is a solid choice although the Honor 6 is worth a look for extra features. It offers flagship-like design, a great camera and a user-friendly Android Lollipop. Read our Sony Xperia M4 Aqua review. 9. HTC 10 Evo Reviewed on: 22 November 16 RRP: £0 Although HTC hasn't confirmed the price yet, it says the 10 Evo will be the best in its class - of £450 to £500 phones. However, that conveniently ignores cheaper phones such as the OnePlus 3 which has a faster processor, more RAM and more storage, and it certainly makes the newcomer appear overpriced even considering its IP57 rating and its clever headphones. However, we'll update this with a definitive conclusion once we've spent more time with the phone. Read our HTC 10 Evo review.

Apple is expected to start manufacturing iPhones in India is not a new story, however, the company will not start assembling iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s instead of previously rumoured iPhone SE. A new media reports suggest that Apple has decided to go ahead with the production despite being turned down by Ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY) regarding various duty exemptions.   To brief it out, Apple seeked tax exemptions on the procurement of components for assembling and repair units for a tenure of 15 years, however, just recently Nirmala Sitharaman (Union Minister of Commerce and Industry) denied Apple’s request for the same stating that it will not be feasible and fair to other handset manufacturers in India which have been following the norm without any extra privileges. Currently, smartphone manufacturers under Make-in-India campaign enjoy Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (MSIPS) and the Electronics Development Fund (EDF) which includes a bunch of benefits.   Interestingly, Apple will reportedly begin with the production process in near future, probably by May-end. Further, Apple iPhone SE, which was previously rumoured to go into production first has now been pushed back for at least 2-3 months. The Cupertino-based giant is expected to hit the production process in its Bengaluru faculty which is currently handled by Apple’s manufacturing partner, Wistron.   In a report from Digit, Apple spokesperson said - “We've been working hard to develop our operations in India. We appreciate the constructive and open dialogue we've had with the government about further expanding our local operations.”   Apple manufacturing iPhones in India will surely result in a dip in pricing even without any special tax exemptions. The current customs duty imposed on smartphones is about 12.5 percent which, if removed, will dip the price by Rs 10,000. Also, we can expect Apple to start selling Make-in-India iPhones sometime by end of this year.
