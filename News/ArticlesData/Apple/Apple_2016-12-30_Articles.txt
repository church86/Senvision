The family claims that Apple had the patent for a safer version of its "FaceTime" video calling app, but chose to make the less safe version available with the iPhone 6 -- ultimately leading to a car crash that resulted in the death of their five-year-old daughter Moriah Modisette, Courthouse News reported this week. The case dates back to 2014 when Moriah was travelling in the back of her parents' car near Dallas and was hit by another car driven by Garrett Willhelm who was using the Apple "FaceTime" while driving. The erring driver had confessed to the police that he was on "FaceTime" and police had also found that the app was still live when they arrived at the scene. Given the fact that the app fully engages visual components, the Modisette family blamed Apple for its failure to either programme a shutoff into the "FaceTime" or give strong warning about using the app while driving. "Defendant Apple Inc. has had the technology to prevent these events, and the Modisettes' injuries, specifically since at least December 12, 2008, when it filed an application with the US Patent Office for a 'driver handheld computing device lock-out," the family said in the complaint. The failure of Apple to use GPS tracking to detect the speed of the vehicle in which a user was travelling and shut down the "FaceTime" app was a significant factor in the accident, the family added. The grieving family has sought economic damages along with punitive damages. Want stories like this in your inbox? Sign up for the weekly ET Panache newsletter.

Breaking News Day at a glance Weather Horoscopes Ireland Business World Showbiz #Discover Sport Tech Jobs Property Login Terror attacks Trump presidency Review: Apple AirPods and going wireless PreviousNext 30/12/2016 - 17:37:47Back to Business Home Wireless headphones – the unlikely topic at the centre of one of the most fierce debates in the world of technology this year – was sparked by Apple and its new AirPods. By now you’ll have heard the arguments both for and against the earpieces – ranging from the impressive tech housed within them to their high price tag of £159. But what about living day-to-day with them? Is the prospect of losing one or both of the Pods as real as it seems? And crucially, is now the time to go wireless? The set-up (SNAPPA) No matter what your initial thoughts are on the AirPods, the set-up process and user experience is one that you can’t help but be impressed by. It’s driven by and centres on the small white carry case for the AirPods. It’s smart and subtle enough to be tucked into your jacket pocket or bag when you head out for the day, while also serving as a charger for the earphones when you’re not using them. The case should also provide more security against losing the Pods too, although it does remain a nagging fear when using them. Beyond that, the wireless connection to your phone is triggered by opening the lid of the case in close proximity to your device. Tap connect on the on-screen prompt and you’re paired. Not only that, but it’s the only time you’ll need to connect the AirPods; in future, as soon as you open the case lid, the connection will be made. (SNAPPA) The case also has a Lightning port so it can be charged when needed. This, combined with the case’s ability to charge the Pods, means you’re very unlikely to ever be hit by low battery anxiety as you make your way home. There’s nothing awkward or cumbersome about carrying the case or reaching for it to use your AirPods, it’s a set- up that makes sense and quickly becomes comfortable. From this angle, the AirPods appeal. The looks (SNAPPA) Apple is known for bringing a level of uniformity and tidiness to and across their various product lines, and that theme is quite clearly still at play here. If you’ve used EarPods at any point in the past four years you’ll be familiar with the look of the AirPods. The same smooth plastic earpieces that Apple provides wired together in each iPhone box are also used here, with the larger speaker sitting on what almost looks like the side of the earbud, and that shapes into your ear. Ignoring the obvious fact that the wires are gone, the only other noticeable change is the elongated bottom of the AirPods, which stretch down farther than their wired counterparts. This is to accommodate a greater amount of technology than any previous Apple earbud – more on that in a moment – but also to enable the microphone in each earpiece to be lower and ever so slightly closer to your mouth to detect when you talking to Siri. Sound and tech (SNAPPA) To prompt that voice control, wearers can double tap on either of the buds while in-ear, giving a hands-free voice control that removes the need for you to shout “Hey Siri” at your iPhone first. Of course, you’re likely to be listening to music most of the time you have the AirPods in and you won’t be disappointed with what you hear. For a wireless connection the AirPods offer good clarity of sound as well as a solid level bass you can feel and appreciate. Crucially, the AirPods feel like an upgrade on EarPods and a match for other premium wireless earphones. (SNAPPA) The small sensor in each Pod that automatically pauses and restarts music when you remove and replace a Pod in your ear is another premium feature offered by few others, adding to the high-end aura. Frankly, the AirPods need to do this to justify the price of £159 – which still feels too steep no matter how much you appreciate the comfort and smart set-up. Early in our testing we also experienced an unusual connection drop-out, where not only did audio drop from the AirPods, but it also shifted to playing loud on our iPhone, which on a crowded commuter train drew some looks. There were a couple of other moments of slight interference, but this was the most notable. (SNAPPA) However, looks should be expected when wearing AirPods – their appearance and bright white finish do catch the eye. The lack of wires only adds to the effect. In an age where wireless over-ear headphones and noise cancelling technology is readily available, it’s noticeable when a premium product such as the AirPods doesn’t offer it. When travelling on a loud underground or metro train, we struggled to hear our audio at times and that’s nothing short of frustrating. Of course, these aren’t over-ear headphones that can block out all surrounding sound, but there’s still room for improvement in cutting out such noise, perhaps in the earphone fit itself, which while comfortable for us, has been loose for others. Such are the perils of only offering one size for all. Verdict (SNAPPA) Having been unveiled to scepticism from some, the AirPods will and do exceed expectations in many ways. The Apple calling cards of smart set-up and use, comfort and head-turning design are expected, but it’s the introduction to wireless audio it will give many that is exciting. Make no mistake, AirPods are an excellent option for music fans who want a little more freedom of movement while listening to their favourite audio. They’re great to use for all occasions – from commuting to exercising – and that is true of few wireless headphones and so should be commended for that, as well as the smart case set-up. However, it’s extremely difficult to look past the price when weighing up whether to buy the AirPods. Yes, Apple is not known for undercutting rivals on price but £159 for a product some already feel they’re being pushed towards feels a step too far. Those who buy them will love them, but convincing consumers it costs this much to go wireless will be quite a fight.

Jon C. Ogg, 24/7 Wall St. 6:33 p.m. EST December 31, 2016 The New York Stock Exchange. (Photo: Mary Altaffer, AP) With 2016 behind us, some investors are looking backward to see what worked and what did not. With a 14% rally in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) this year, the more important issue to consider is what investors should expect for 2017. The Dow has been within 1% of 20,000 for several days now. What if the Dow actually manages to hit 22,000 in 2017? It may be far more possible than most investors might imagine. 24/7 Wall St. has evaluated many of the preliminary views for key companies and industries ahead. Regardless of which candidate voters favored, it is now very hard to find investors who do not view the markets more favorably and more pro-business with higher growth environment. After all, the 8.5% rally in the Dow since the Nov. 8 election is almost unprecedented and is too large to merely assign as a coincidence or as a relief rally. Investors have bought every major market pullback for about six years now, and the bull market is rapidly approaching eight years old. Investors are looking for value and overlooked growth, and they are even looking for upside in popular names that simply have more upside to run. It turns out that many of the 30 DJIA stocks have a consensus analyst price target from Thomson Reuters that calls for substantial upside in the next 12 months. And then investors get to add in the dividends as well. The pro-growth strategies laid out ahead have been a boom for infrastructure companies tied to all sides of major engineering projects and those that process or mine materials. Then there is a lower-regulation and higher-rate environment driving financials and cyclicals. And of course those companies ready to repatriate over $1 trillion in overseas cash are expected to face a much more reasonable corporate tax environment versus other countries. Before just assuming that Dow 20,000 will come and turn into 22,000, it is important to reflect on some real issues. Rallies of this magnitude are rarely, if ever, followed by a straight line higher. Many investors put off traditional year-end profit taking due to expecting lower capital gain taxes in 2017. Many Dow and S&P stocks are now also valued above or very close to their consensus analyst target prices. Many of the Trump-beneficiary stocks also have rallied to the point that much or all of the good news for 2017 already may have taken place. What if the Federal Reserve raises rates more than expected? Will the political infighting of the past decade continue ahead? Also, and sadly, analysts can simply end up being wrong. And we almost never hear about geopolitical risks right now. All of these are risks to the rally not facing a pullback. 24/7 Wall St. showed a preliminary bull-bear case for the Dow in 2016 at 19,700. The Dow was valued just above 19,200 on Dec. 6 when we first looked at a Dow 20,000+, and the Dow has now hit a high of 19,987 as of Dec. 29. Here are some of the key driving forces that could help the Dow Jones Industrial Average get closer to 22,000 in 2017. Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs Group (GS) already has risen to above $240.00 in 2016, and the shares are up 32% just since Nov. 8. Its stock price has passed its $229.00 consensus analyst price target. One reason the Dow has outperformed the S&P 500 since the election is that the Dow’s price-weighted valuation (rather than market cap-weighted for other indexes) is dominated by Goldman Sachs’ 8.3% index weighting, almost three-times the average Dow stock’s weighting. It has accounted for close to one-fourth of the Dow’s post-election gain. 24/7 WALL ST. The Best CEOs of 2016 Some analysts see even more bright skies ahead for Goldman Sachs. Outside of the company landing two top positions in the upcoming administration, HSBC is calling for a $250 target and Deutsche Bank now has a $255 target. If lower regulation allows for more trading, Goldman Sachs’ profit history could dictate even better earnings and far more upside than its paltry 1% dividend yield. Apple Apple Inc. (AAPL) was last seen trading at close to $116, and its 52-week high is just $118.69. Apple’s consensus price target is now up at $132.00 and has climbed slowly higher for months. Apple’s 2% dividend yield could rise handily if the company repatriates its massive overseas cash sum of close to $200 billion, and Apple is valued at only about 11 times next year’s earnings estimate. Credit Suisse just on December 6 reiterated its Outperform rating and $150 price target for Apple with hopes of iPhone 8 super-cycle. Recent reports of the big product being an iPhone 7s in 2017 could jeopardize that, but Apple has the largest cash trove of all companies (by far) and it buys back large amounts of stock. Apple’s 52-week trading range is $89.47 to $118.69, its market cap is $622 billion and its weighting of 4.03% in the Dow is ranked just 10th out of 30 index components. Cisco Systems Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) has recovered to $30.22, and its consensus analyst target is $33.11. It also has close to a 3.4% dividend yield, and the company is a monster when it comes to buying back shares. Cisco shares are valued at 12 times forward earnings. They are still about 10% shy of its 2007 high, and the share price is still less than half of its all-time back in the tech bubble peak in 2000. 24/7 WALL ST. The Best (and Worst) Investments of 2016 The 52-week range here is $22.46 to $31.95, and the market cap is $153 billion. RBC just named it among the top tech picks for 2017 and the firm is calling for a $35 share price for Cisco. Coca-Cola Coca-Cola Co. (KO) has been a sleeper, but what if 2017 is the breakout year for the sugar-water giant? Its $41.46 share price is well shy of the consensus price target of $45.75, and the 3.4% dividend yield would imply north of 15% upside. The stock is valued at 20 times expected earnings per share. Despite being more dependent on sugary beverages than rival Pepsi, the reality is that Coca-Cola has been diversifying away from its name brand for years. The stock has been a sleeper for so long, and it mostly has been in a $39 to $44 trading band for the past three years. Coca-Cola still has global expansion opportunities and cost containment opportunities ahead, and it is possible that value investors will begin to focus on what may be a defensive stock with limited downside. Coca-Cola also has raised its dividend for more than 50 years and has a market value of close to $180 billion. Home Depot Home Depot Inc. (HD) has recovered to $134.08 as of December's end, and its consensus price target now has risen to $147. That and its 2% dividend yield would generate upside of over 10%. The stock is valued at 18 times expected earnings for next year. Home Depot ran into some issues after peaking in the summer. But weak consumer and a slowing in housing have now been replaced by a euphoric consumer and expectations for a strong housing market to continue. It seems hard for Home Depot to not participate in this retail and housing upside. Home Depot has a 52-week range of $109.62 to $139.00 and a market cap of $164 billion. Intel Shares of Intel Corp. (INTC) were last seen trading at $36.30, and its consensus price target is now almost $40. Intel’s dividend yield is also close to 3%, and it is valued at less than 13 times 2017 earnings. 24/7 WALL ST. America's 25 Thriving Industries What has occurred is that the personal computer market finally has come back due to gaming, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Intel also has expanded well beyond desktops; it is deep in servers and the Internet of Things, and it is even a growing partner for many chip companies now. Intel’s market cap is $174 billion, and it has traded in 52-week range of $27.68 to $38.36. Nike Nike Inc. (NKE) was the worst stock of 2016, down 17% for the year. With shares last seen at nearly $51, the consensus price target is $62, and that implies 20% upside — with lots of room for its mere 1% dividend yield to grow, on top of share buybacks. Nike is the leader in the athletic apparel market and there have been concerns that “athleisure” has peaked. Brands like Under Armour, Adidas and Reebok also want their piece of Nike’s market. What is amazing about all the negativity here is that analysts expect Nike to grow sales to $41 billion in 2019 from about $32 billion in 2016, with earnings growth expected to be about 40% over the same period. What if everyone has been too negative here? Nike’s 52-week trading range is $49.01 to $68.19, and it has a market cap of $85 billion. Pfizer Pfizer Inc. (PFE) was trading at $32.35, and its consensus price target of $37.65 implies upside of 16.4%, even before considering a dividend yield of almost 4%. Pfizer shares are valued at only about 12 times forward earnings. 2016 has been a dud for Pfizer, with a gain of just 4%, versus a 16% gain so far for rival Merck. Pfizer had been torn in long-term efforts, like whether to move or acquire overseas, deciding if the restructuring would lead to a break-up, and deciding whether to sell some assets. There was also the overhang of political pricing pressure on drug prices. While cheap underperforming stocks are that way for a reason, what if Pfizer has become too cheap versus Merck, or what if it releases some unexpected news or makes a great acquisition in 2017? Pfizer’s market cap is $196 billion, and its shares have a 52-week range of $28.25 to $37.39. Procter & Gamble Last seen trading near $84, Procter & Gamble (PG) has a consensus analyst upside of $91.00. This is still almost 10% in implied upside, without even considering its 3% dividend yield. The consumer products giant has restructured and pared down its brands, but it is still valued at 19.5 times forward earnings. Procter & Gamble has raised its dividend for over 50 consecutive years now. One issue is that it has faced is harder overseas sales comps due to that strong dollar, and it seems hard to imagine that the company can shrink its brands back into a growth company. Still, this is a company that remains quite friendly to shareholders. Perhaps its endless list of brands should just speak for itself. The 52-week range is $74.46 to $90.33, and its market cap is $225 billion, making the company larger than its top three consumer products peers in the United States combined. UnitedHealth UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) was trading at $160.04, and the consensus price target has lifted to $179 now. This implies upside of 11%, before considering its 1.5% dividend yield. What is amazing about the expected upside is that UnitedHealth shares have risen almost 40% in 2016, and 13% of those gains have come since the election. The largest insurer of them all is valued at about 17 times expected 2017 earnings. Being a health insurer under Obamacare turned out to be fine for UnitedHealth, and now it seems that analysts have little fears around a Trump effort to replace Obamacare. It has vacated most exchange operations and is focused on the group market and other value-added opportunities. How the health insurer ultimately will be treated under a regime in which Obamacare gets dismantled remains to be seen. Still, even the lowest analyst price target would imply a 5% drop and the highest analyst target is $200. UnitedHealth has a market cap of over $150 billion, and its weighting is 5.5% of the Dow’s 30 components. Visa Visa Inc. (V) was last seen at $78.02, and it has a consensus price target of $94.20, for an implied upside of 20%. Its dividend yield of less than 1% could have exponential upside, as it is less than one-fourth of earnings. Visa could be a huge winner from repatriation efforts, and a strong consumer spending environment should allow it to ring the register as it wins each time there are credit card transactions. Visa shares are well off of prior highs, but it is still valued at almost 20 times forward earnings. Many investors think of Visa a financial powerhouse now that it is a newer Dow component, but Visa is actually a platform provider with massive room to boost its weak dividend. Still, every company under the sun seems to want a piece of payment technology, and that has weighed at least some on Visa’s dominance. If analysts are right, then Visa shares have pulled back too far from its 52-week high of $83.96. Its shares are actually down since the election, and they have risen less than 2% so far in 2016. Again, there are many circumstances that have to occur for this recent enthusiasm to last. It would only be prudent to expect that some of the typical year-end profit-taking being delayed into next year might bring some selling early on. And it is possible that the strength of the post-election rally has already borrowed from the 2017 upside. Many analysts are certain to update and issue more formal 2017 targets after the start of the year. The formal bull-bear case for 2017 has to be followed by policy and structural changes in Washington, D.C., and a return to more rapid economic growth. The Dow has risen about 8.5% since November 8 alone, and the year-to-date gains in 2016 have been just over 14%. For a relative value between these Dow stocks and the S&P 500 Index, the S&P 500 was last seen valued at 17.3 times expected 2017 earnings per share and at 18.7 times its 2016 estimated earnings per share. 24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

The slower pedal could have been spurred by lukewarm iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus sales last quarter.  ( Leon Neal | Getty Images ) Advertisement Apple is slowing down its iPhone production by about 10 percent in the first financial quarter of 2017, according to a new report posted this week, citing calculations made from supplier data. This comes after a Flurry Analytics report, which saw Apple tower atop the charts in terms of device activations this holiday season, besting other companies. Cutting iPhone Production Down The report comes from Nikkei, positioning the production cuts as the result of sluggish iPhone sales in the previous quarter. This isn't the first time for Apple to slash production rates for its smartphone line — it had done so in the January to March 2016, after inventory of the iPhone 6s line accumulated at the end of 2015. The experience led the company to curb iPhone 7 production by about 20 percent this year, Nikkei said. Still, iPhone 7 sales were slower than expected. Reuters has already reached out to an Apple spokesperson but wasn't able to get any comments. Other iPhone News Nikkei says that Apple has had difficulty appealing to consumers with new features on its flagship smartphone. The iPhone 7 and its larger dual-camera-wielding sibling, the iPhone 7 Plus, arguably weren't stark upgrades over their predecessors, which is possibly the reason why there's little fanfare behind the two. However, Apple is expected to make headway for a new line of iPhones in 2017, with rumors touting a new iteration that's drastically different from past entries. Tentatively named the iPhone 8, the phone marks the tenth anniversary for the iPhone line, and Apple might finally radically refresh the design this time. iPhone 8 Several rumors have suggested that it could come in three different sizes, and the largest one could feature an AMOLED display supplied exclusively by Samsung. The phones may also sport an all-glass design that'll pave the way for wireless charging, a feature Apple has never given its smartphones. Rumors also point to a 10-nanometer A11 chip under the hood, faster and more power efficient than the previous iteration. It's been reported that TSMC has completed the early design stages of the chip. Advanced biometric features could also be slated for the phone in question, with facial recognition and iris scanning as examples. It remains to be seen what purpose they could serve, if indeed true, but they will likely be alternative unlocking methods, or they could act as another layer of protection during transactions, such as online payments. There's also whispers of a new 5-inch model with a vertical dual-camera setup due for a 2017 release, bearing the same internals as the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. We'll know more as 2017 comes into finer view. TAG Apple, iPhone, iPhone 7 © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     Apple Is Keen On Bringing Digital Crown To The IPhone And IPad Posted: Dec 31 2016, 11:54am CST | by Ahmed Humayun, in Rumors | Apple   Patently Apple   Digital crown may be seen on iPhones and iPads in future Usually we get the feeling that the folks at Apple find nothing more enjoyable than filing a good patent application. They patent everything and anything they find even if it never finds a spot in a shipping product at the end. Don't Miss: Latest Science and Medical Discoveries Apple’s patent applications happen to garner the most interest. The latest of such applications brought to the attention of ‘Patently Apple' is the Apple Watch-Like Digital Crown. This will be able to be used on devices including the iPhone and iPad. The crown is an interesting interface feature for the Apple Watch and will allow for new interactions on any device it appears on. In the latest applications 20160378187 and 20160378189 Apple has outlined why it thinks crown will be beneficial to owners of devices which usually do not feature mechanics of such kind. The main aim is to provide feedback to interactions. Apple sees this as a great accessibility feature as well as an interface design. The applications are very wordy and complicated. However in simple terms Apple is bringing a Digital Crown-like interface to the iPad and iPhone. Whether this idea is good enough may depend on the exposure to the Apple Watch but then we wonder if this will ever see the light of day or not as with Apple p’atent applications there is no guarantee if the product actually comes to work.

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     IOS 10.3 Beta Release Date Is Set For 10th January-Will Feature A Theatre Mode Too Posted: Dec 31 2016, 12:09pm CST | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Dec 31 2016, 12:11pm CST, in News | Apple     According to the latest rumor Apple is set to release the iOS 10.3 Beta on January 10th with an addition of a new mode called the ‘Theatre mode’. Apple is becoming more prolific with its beta releases for the iOS and macOS. Don't Miss: Latest Science and Medical Discoveries Rumors are already beginning to surface as to what the new iOS 10.3 will bring when the first beta ships. Sonny Dickinson who is generally reliable with his comments has given his say on the subject on Twitter today. He has claimed that the first beta release of 10.3 will be with developers by January 10th. The specific date provided by Dickinson does provoke us to think that he knows something rather than simply putting the pieces together. iOS 10.3 beta 1 is scheduled to seed on January 10th.— Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) December 30, 2016 However Apple can be very unpredictable and may change its plans at the last minute. We may never really know for sure until we see the OTA update pop up on the developers device. Till then let’s just hang on to Dickinson’s word. The release date is not the only thing Dickinson has brought forward today. He has also claimed that the new software will offer a ‘Theatre mode’. It will feature a new accessibility option via a button within the Control Centre. The button is described by Dickinson to be shaped like a popcorn to describe the feature itself more vividly. As the name suggests the new mode will offer features such as dimmed screen lighting, less notifications and maybe even a Night Shift which would change the color of the screen to enhance the movie experience.

Photo Galleries Spokesman-Recorder (501c3) Subscribe Special needs a specialty of Apple Tree Dental December 31, 2016 by Bob Keller Leave a Comment ADVERTISEMENT (MGN On     Appropriate and competent dental care is needed for every population. Apple Tree Dental is a nonprofit group dental practice specializing in geriatric and special needs dental care. Starting 31 years ago in 1985, the clinic was initially founded around the care of older adults and in-house older adults who lived in long-term care facilities or needed home health services. Dr. Michael Helgeson, Apple Tree CEO and one of the founders, told MSR, “The founders of Apple Tree have a strong history in geriatric dentistry. “That group in particular faces a lot of barriers to care, including their general health condition, their cognitive conditions, and other conditions that make it particularly hard to provide those services for them. Also, living in institutions gives them transportation barriers.” Helgeson went through a two-year post-graduate program in geriatrics and special care dentistry. He proudly stated, “There are not too many dentist in the nation that have that kind of training for treating older adults, in particular older adults with more chronic problems such as frail older adults; [there are] also younger adults with special needs. “They may have developmental disabilities, brain injuries, mental health issues, cognitive impairment, or a wide variety of conditions that require some special adaptations and different approaches that a general dentist may not be comfortable with,” Helgeson explained. He also was in the public health field for four years and has experience working with underserved populations, low-income families, and service in rural communities. He brings the background of special care (working with populations that may need modified dental care) and public dental health to his work, which he says “is part of the DNA of Apple Tree Dental.” Helgeson continued, “Many frail older adults end up spending the remaining of their savings on their healthcare needs and the majority, about three-quarters, become dependent on Medicaid when they are in long-term care facilities. The Medicaid program provides very little dental benefits, and it pays very little for dentistry. So there are financial barriers that are faced by that population as well.” Based on this need, the clinic developed new ways of care. They developed mobile, portable dental equipment and bring this equipment to their patients inside nursing homes, which helps to coordinate services with nursing staff and direct care givers. This opens up opportunities to give care where patients live. “Providing care where they live was one of the first innovations of Apple Tree Dental 31 years ago,” said Helgeson. Today, they provide services to over 80 long-term care facilities in Minnesota. “Since 1985, we have developed programs that are similar to the special needs programs that reach low-income children at Head Start centers. We have school-based programs where we provide services to predominantly low-income families at their schools. We are delivering services to a mental health facility down in Rochester for patients with mental illness and chemical dependency.” They also deliver care out in the community through mobile and portable systems. They call their clinics “Centers for Dental Health,” and they provide services to everyone, meaning they are open to the public. Currently, their centers for dental health in Minnesota are located in Holly, Fergus Falls, Coon Rapids, Mounds View, Madelia and Rochester. Their mobile and portable delivery systems serve the communities around those six main clinics. What does the future hold for Apple Tree Dental? “We are looking forward to bridging the worlds of medical health and dental health. Over the last 30 years there has been more and more research that shows the connection between general health outcomes and dental health outcomes. Heart disease and diabetes are two conditions that are generally affected by conditions of the mouth,” Helgeson stated. Apple Tree Dental looks forward to advocating for and educating more communities about special needs dental care and providing dental care to those who need it.   For more information on Apple Tree clinics, visit their website at www.appletreedental.org or call them at 763-754-5780.

Enlarge Image Can Apple's FaceTime be held responsible?Photo by Apple The SUV hit them from behind. It was going 65 mph. It went up, onto and over the Modisette family's Toyota Camry on Interstate 35, north of Dallas. James Modisette, who was driving, was critically injured. His five-year-old daughter, Moriah, sitting behind him, died of her injuries. These are some of the details of a lawsuit filed just before Christmas in Santa Clara, California. Why there? The defendant is Apple. The Modisettes claim that the accident, which happened in December 2014, occurred because the other driver was using FaceTime on his iPhone 6 Plus. According to the Denton Record-Chronicle, the driver of the SUV, 22-year-old Garrett Edward Wilhelm, admitted to police that he was on the phone at the time of the crash. How, though, could Apple be responsible? The Modisettes say that Apple failed to "install and implement the safer, alternative design [...] to 'lock out' the ability of drivers to utilize the 'FaceTime' application on the Apple iPhone while driving a motor vehicle." The lawsuit says that Apple applied for the patent in 2008 and had it issued in December 2014. It claims that Apple could have installed it by the time of the accident. It also says that Apple "failed to warn its users that its product was likely to be dangerous when used or misused in a reasonably foreseeable manner." Therefore, says the suit, the phone was essentially defective when it left Apple's hands. The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The driver of the SUV is currently facing manslaughter charges. The plaintiffs claim that Apple's failure to implement safety technology on the video chat service was "a substantial factor in causing the plaintiffs' injuries and decedent's death." They say that Apple knew about "the compulsory, addictive and dangerous nature of iPhone usage by drivers," and it "voluntarily and intentionally failed to implement the technology."

It would suggest that everything from FaceTime to Facebook used by a distracted driver contributed to any subsequent accident. Tech companies have traditionally defended not immobilizing phones during driving by saying that it's not reliable. As the New York Times reported earlier this year, the companies say they can't guarantee that, in trying to block a driver's phone, they won't block a passenger's device. This may be one of those issues where no company wants to be the first to disable phones. As more accidents are caused by tech-related distracted driving, the pressure on all companies will surely increase. Highway deaths rose this year -- up 10.4 percent in the first half of 2016. That's not to suggest that technology is responsible for all of them. The existence of all sorts of technology in cars, though -- some built-in, others not -- by its very nature must distract.

Enlarge Image Can Apple's FaceTime be held responsible?Photo by Apple The SUV hit them from behind. It was going 65 mph. It went up, onto and over the Modisette family's Toyota Camry on Interstate 35, north of Dallas. James Modisette, who was driving, was critically injured. His five-year-old daughter, Moriah, sitting behind him, died of her injuries. These are some of the details of a lawsuit filed just before Christmas in Santa Clara, California. Why there? The defendant is Apple. The Modisettes claim that the accident, which happened in December 2014, occurred because the other driver was using FaceTime on his iPhone 6 Plus. According to the Denton Record-Chronicle, the driver of the SUV, 22-year-old Garrett Edward Wilhelm, admitted to police that he was on the phone at the time of the crash. How, though, could Apple be responsible? The Modisettes say that Apple failed to "install and implement the safer, alternative design [...] to 'lock out' the ability of drivers to utilize the 'FaceTime' application on the Apple iPhone while driving a motor vehicle." The lawsuit says that Apple applied for the patent in 2008 and had it issued in December 2014. It claims that Apple could have installed it by the time of the accident. It also says that Apple "failed to warn its users that its product was likely to be dangerous when used or misused in a reasonably foreseeable manner." Therefore, says the suit, the phone was essentially defective when it left Apple's hands. The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The driver of the SUV is currently facing manslaughter charges. The plaintiffs claim that Apple's failure to implement safety technology on the video chat service was "a substantial factor in causing the plaintiffs' injuries and decedent's death." They say that Apple knew about "the compulsory, addictive and dangerous nature of iPhone usage by drivers," and it "voluntarily and intentionally failed to implement the technology." More Technically Incorrect Watch this scary aborted jet landing in the wind Moscow mocks Obama with Donald Trump-style tweet Uber driver insults famous football coach (who's the passenger) If such an action was to succeed, it would surely open the door to many more lawsuits involving anyone using technology while driving. It would suggest that everything from FaceTime to Facebook used by a distracted driver contributed to any subsequent accident. Tech companies have traditionally defended not immobilizing phones during driving by saying that it's not reliable. As the New York Times reported earlier this year, the companies say they can't guarantee that, in trying to block a driver's phone, they won't block a passenger's device. This may be one of those issues where no company wants to be the first to disable phones. As more accidents are caused by tech-related distracted driving, the pressure on all companies will surely increase. Highway deaths rose this year -- up 10.4 percent in the first half of 2016. That's not to suggest that technology is responsible for all of them. The existence of all sorts of technology in cars, though -- some built-in, others not -- by its very nature must distract. How many devastating crashes involving of drivers using Snapchat or Facebook must there be before tech companies -- or the government -- decide enough is enough?

What's in Store for Apple in 2017 GO Will Apple dedicate more time and money to the cloud? How about Siri and the Desktop computer line-up? Dec 31, 2016 19:55 GMT  ·  By Adrian Boioglu  ·  Share:  2016 was all about the MacBook. The computer that is going to change the future of ports and connectors was born. We have also got a phone with a missing headphone jack. For some users, this is a big downer. Others are happy with their AirPods.  Next year seems to be a good one for the desktop computer. Will the Mac mini survive? Is the Mac Pro still up for a refresh? Siri on macOS Siri jumped from the iPhone to the Mac in 2016. It was a long-awaited move that failed to amaze users. Sure enough, the implementation is simple and elegant, just as Apple would do it, but the functionality lacks. Siri can find documents for you, play music, calculate free space, open FaceTime, find tweets, or add Calendar appointments, but there is no way to use it in third-party apps. Virtual Assistants are the future of computing. The rise of Alexa from Amazon and Google's Assistant made it difficult for Siri to shine, though. Apple's way of implementing it as a local functionality as opposed to something server- or cloud-driven and the fact that it can be just as good but secure and privacy-aware at the same time were the keys to its success. In 2017, users will want more Siri. Apple's virtual Assistant needs to be more context-aware and respond to queries in a different manner. Another important issue is the cloud situation in Apple's ecosystem. Users are not happy with the 5GB free tier and the fact that iCloud lacks some of the functionality of Dropbox or other cloud services. Cutting the cord Removing the headphone jack from the iPhone was Apple's big bet. But the fact that the AirPods were late made it difficult for users who wanted to listen to music for a few good months. Now it all starts to make sense. The AirPods are Apple's way to show everyone that they can still come up with "magical" technology. Sure enough, these are not the first bluetooth earbuds ever released, but the fact that they pair with your device right away, the long-lasting battery of the case, and the added functionality like taps that pause and play your songs or podcasts make the AirPods a clear winner in the long run. Apple proved that they could come up with a stylish solution to a decades-old problem: tangling earbuds cords and bulky bands attached to bluetooth headsets. How can this evolve in 2017? First of all, we need to see what we really need from a small headset. The AirPods seem future-proof for at least 5 years to come, and other manufacturers are unlikely to come out with something so different that can capture the market. Betting on USB-C The MacBook Pro just got a long-awaited redesign. The fact that we have a lighter laptop that looks amazing and keeps the same 10-hour battery life is pretty awesome. Apple's big bet in 2016 was on USB-C. Whether you like it or not, this will be the standard for ports for years to come. The guys in Cupertino got rid of their famous MagSafe connector just to replace it with a more versatile connector like the USB-C. Angry customers will have to learn to live with that. What comes up after this radical redesign? We may see a new version of the MacBook Pro with an SD card slot, but this may be just wishful thinking from a long-time user like myself. Apple needs to work on their batteries. Sure enough, no breakthrough is on the timeline for 2017. 2017 - The year of the Desktop Mac The Mac Pro is waaay overdue for an update. Will we get a device that has only 6 USB-C Ports? This may turn pro users to other devices and we may see the rise of the Hackint0sh once again. The Mac mini has been neglected for a long while and it may be the first device to disappear. On the other hand, Apple just quit making their beautiful Cinema Displays, so there is no hope for a standalone desktop computer that needs an external monitor. Our big hope is for the iMac. Although the 5K Cinema Displays are gone, Apple may still want to stay in the business for a good desktop computer. The iMac is also due for an update and there is no way users will be left out in 2017. How can the iMac evolve? Well, one can only hope that it won't feature USB-C ports only... Is it time for an iPhone 8? With strong sales like the ones they've got for the iPhone 7, Apple is not in a hurry to release the iPhone 8. However, Samsung is longing for a comeback after the Samsung Note 7 and Google may be trying to come out with a redesigned Pixel phone. It is too early to call the shots for an iPhone 8 in 2017, but users surely want one.

Saturday December 31, 2016 11:28 am PST by Juli Clover We've covered what we expect to see from Apple in 2017 based on the rumors that are circulating so far in our recent What to Expect post. On the horizon are a new iPhone 8 with a radically redesigned body and an edge-to-edge display, a revamped iPad Pro also potentially with an edge-to-edge display, long-awaited iMac updates, and new software, but there's always the chance there's a wildcard update or new product in the works that will surprise us all. A redesigned Apple TV, a new home hub, and augmented reality smart glasses are all products that are rumored to be in the works with no prospective release date. We want to hear from the MacRumors community -- what are you expecting or hoping to see Apple release in 2017? Are there specific features you're hoping Apple will implement in iOS 11, tvOS 11, watchOS 4, or macOS 10.13? Popular wishlist items from last year included a dark mode for iOS, home screen widgets, and a customizable control center. Let us know what you want to see in the comments, and make sure to check our our What to Expect post for the latest rumors. Apple's plans for 2017 will likely become more clear in the early months of the year, and as always, we'll be covering all of the rumors in-depth here at MacRumors. The MacRumors forums are also always a rich resource for talking about upcoming products and rumors, and with the biggest iPhone change in years set to happen in 2017, our forums are the place to be for lively discussions.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Fires dominate news: Pilot, Bluecut blazes are biggest local stories of 2016 Saturday Dec 31, 2016 at 11:24 AM Dec 31, 2016 at 11:24 AM Staff Reports There was a wealth of big news locally in 2016, but nothing could top the two major wildfires that broke out in a one-week span in August. No sooner had firefighters contained the Pilot Fire that broke out near Silverwood Lake than they were confronted with a monster blaze, the Bluecut Fire that started in the middle of the Cajon Pass. The latter forced authorities to issue evacuation orders for more than 82,000 High Desert residents, including the entire community of Wrightwood. Here's a look at the top 10 local news stories of 2016: BLUECUT FIRE The 36,274-acre Bluecut Fire, which began Aug. 16 and quickly grew, was the fifth largest wildfire reported in the state in 2016. The blaze erupted in the Cajon Pass just hours after fire officials announced the Pilot Fire had been fully contained. Firefighters made aggressive attacks, including using 241,414 gallons of fire retardant on the first day. But erratic winds spread the fire quickly and carried embers up to 2 miles away, touching off new fires. By the end of the first day, authorities had shut down Interstate 15 in both directions and issued mandatory evacuation orders for over 82,000 residents, including those in West Cajon Valley, Wrightwood, Phelan, Oak Hills and southwest Hesperia. The blaze destroyed an estimated 105 homes, 213 outbuildings and more than 200 vehicles, mostly in the West Cajon Valley, and was declared fully contained on Aug. 23. At the peak of the battle to control the Bluecut Fire, 2,684 personnel were actively involved. The Bluecut Fire saw 499,336 gallons of retardant used. Last estimates showed more than $18 million was spent fighting the blaze. Fire officials say investigators still have not determined its cause. PILOT FIRE Firefighters had their hands full in August battling various wildfires in the region. The first was the Pilot Fire, which burned 8,110 acres in the San Bernardino Mountains and Summit Valley. The Pilot Fire began on Aug. 7 near the Miller Canyon off-highway vehicle area off of Highway 138. The California Highway Patrol, for some time, had rolled the wildfire into an earlier incident logged as a "car fire." But CHP officials were not able to confirm whether the two incidents were connected. By the end of the first night the blaze spread to 1,500 acres, prompting a massive firefighting response from local and regional agencies. The blaze quickly resulted in over 5,300 evacuation orders for homes in the southeast Hesperia, Lake Arrowhead, Lake Gregory and Crestline. Firefighters made aggressive attacks, including using 312,000 gallons of fire retardant on the first day. The Pilot Fire was not officially contained until Aug. 16. Fire officials reported no structures were damaged or destroyed. One firefighter suffered minor injuries. The last estimates available from the San Bernardino National Forest Service show the cost at more than $16 million. The Pilot Fire was listed as the 10th largest wildfire in California in 2016. Fire officials say investigators still have not determined its cause. CAJON PASS CONSTRUCTION After nearly three years of construction on Interstate 15 in the Cajon Pass, Caltrans held a May ceremony to declare both the $324 million Devore Interchange and $121 million Cajon Pass Rehabilitation projects complete — under budget and ahead of schedule. High Desert commuters had to endure lane closures, bypass lanes, reduced speed limits and limited shoulder access while Caltrans’ contractors worked on the projects. The Devore Interchange Project added lanes and created truck bypass lanes on both north and southbound I-15 at the Devore curve, while the Rehabilitation Project removed and replaced badly worn pavement up and down the Cajon Pass. The result of the construction is pavement that should last at least 40 years and additional lanes that should eliminate one of the five worst traffic bottlenecks in the nation. MURDERS OF APPLE VALLEY COUPLE The murders of an elderly Apple Valley couple sent shock waves through the community — with the lack of information initially available keeping residents on edge for weeks. Louis and Rose Giuntini, longtime Apple Valley residents, were found dead inside their home on Highway 18 on Feb. 29. Sheriff’s officials classified their deaths as homicides but remained tight-lipped on details, prompting concerns from neighbors fearful that a killer may be in their midst. Officials finally broke their silence on March 9, naming a Lancaster man recently released from state prison, Keon Bailey, as a “person of interest” in the slayings. However, it wasn’t until more than two months after the murders that DNA evidence positively identified Bailey — who was killed in a robbery in the South Bay before being identified as the sole suspect in the Giuntinis' slayings. Bailey was also connected to three other crimes in the Apple Valley area that occurred before and after the murders, and another robbery in Long Beach during a crime spree he began just days after he was released from prison. The Giuntinis were recently honored by the Town of Apple Valley with the dedication of a bench installed at the Apple Valley Golf Course in late November in the couple's memory. HESPERIA COUNCIL APPROVES TAPESTRY After almost a year of discussion where many residents expressed outrage and concern over the proposed Tapestry housing project in southeast Hesperia, the City Council approved the project in January. Approval of the 30-year build out project, which will bring 16,196 homes to Hesperia in multiple phases, was quickly met by a several lawsuits against the Terra Verde Group and the city of Hesperia. The Crestline Sanitation District and a coalition of public-interest groups, including the Center for Biological Diversity, the San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society and the Sierra Club, filed lawsuits. Although public discussion has ended on the Tapestry project, many residents told the Daily Press they will remember the seated Council members who approved Tapestry should they choose to run for re-election. DEMISE OF MOJAVE ALUMINUM PLANT The $120 million, 500,000-square-foot aluminum remelt and casting house plant proposed to be built in Lenwood met its demise in 2016. Developer Eric Shen had said the plant would employ up to 450 people and would be a scaled-down version of one the Barstow City Council approved in March 2014. Shen sent a letter to the city saying his Mojave Aluminum Company would not proceed with the building of the smaller plant. He blamed the project's demise on a Dupre Analytics report released in August. The online report accused China Zhongwang Holdings Limited of fraudulent market practices. Shen was named as a "key player" for China Zhongwang's Chairman Liu Zhongtian in the report. Shen's attorney, Dean Kajioka, of Kajioka & Associates in Las Vegas, denied any wrongdoing by his client. THE MAVERICKS STRIKE OUT When the High Desert Mavericks won the California League championship in September, the team was playing for a bookend of titles for the franchise, which won its first championship in its inaugural 1991 season. A month before, the California League announced it would dissolve the Mavericks and Bakersfield Blaze at the end of the year and downsize the league to eight teams. For the Blaze, failures to command a new stadium appeared to seal its fate, while the Mavericks became the second team — the odd man out — in part because of a tense feud that had been stirring for months. The Adelanto City Council voted in January to tear up the $1 annual stadium agreement inked with the team four years earlier, saying it violated the state Constitution and was tantamount to a gift of public funds. The team sued, the city sued, but the damage was done. The lawsuit brought by Mavericks ownership, which has won battles in court so far, is expected to enter mediation as early as the fall. GREEN TREE EXTENSION GETS FUNDED San Bernardino Associated Governments approved a $12.5 million loan for Victorville's Green Tree Extension project in October, securing a much-needed funding source for the city's most significant infrastructure undertaking since the Nisqualli Interchange. Until the loan agreement, the project's financial viability had often been met by skepticism. The city, town of Apple Valley and San Bernardino County later approved the loan as project partners. The loan was widely seen by officials as a signal of inclusiveness within the Victor Valley and it allowed Victorville to project that construction could start in late 2018. The $45 million extension, the final leg of the Yucca Loma Corridor, will stretch Green Tree Boulevard about a mile from Hesperia Road to Ridgecrest/Yates roads, includes a bridge over BNSF railroad tracks and will ultimately create a third arterial connection from Apple Valley to Interstate 15 via the recently completed Yucca Loma Bridge. ELECTION OUSTERS Two councilman in the High Desert who had both served as mayor of their respective cities at some point were ousted from the dais during the November general election: Victorville Councilman Ryan McEachron finished fifth in a race for three seats; Hesperia Councilman Eric Schmidt came in third in a contest with two seats open. The outcome in races in both cities altered the dynamic of the councils and acted as a referendum for change. McEachron, who may have been hurt by his support of toll lanes on Interstate 15, had served on the Council since 2008. Schmidt, who stood behind the unpopular Tapestry master development housing project, was first elected in 2012. Both are well-known businessmen in the region with strong connections to civic, business and community groups. During their final council meetings, both were praised by colleagues and each expressed gratitude for having been given the opportunity to serve. OAK HILLS HIGH HAZING CLAIMS In September, a second former Oak Hills High freshman football player sued the school and Hesperia Unified School District, alleging he was subjected daily to hazing during the 2012-13 football season. It was the second civil complaint filed in two years accusing officials of creating a culture where systemic sadomasochistic sexual hazing occurred. But the alleged issues hit a crescendo when they were exposed to a national audience as part of ESPN's "Outside the Lines" program, which aired in September and highlighted claims by a first plaintiff who filed suit in 2014. That case is expected to go to trial as early as mid-February, while the later case has a trial setting conference scheduled for April, court records show. While the district and school have denied the claims, the attorney representing the former freshman football players has suggested there are likely other purported victims.   About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Reader Services Contact Us E-Paper Help Subscribe Now Report a Problem Online Services Newsletters/Alerts Archives Story Archive Obituary Archive Photo Archive Advertising Info Advertise with Us Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2017 GateHouse Media, LLC.

The Nexus replacement is a beast of a phone, and aims to showcase the best of what Google and Android has to offer. It comes equipped with top-of-the-line hardware, sleek design, bright HD display, and great camera. If you are disappointed with Samsung's exploding phones and Apple's mediocrity, the Google Pixel will serve as a breath of fresh air. Daydream VR You can now transform your Android phone into a virtual fantasyland with the help of the Daydream VR headset. Enjoy 360 degree games, movies, and panoramic photos simply by fastening your phone into the device. Unlike the control buttons located on the Samsung Gear VR handset, the Daydream comes with a separate controller that you can use to wield and navigate your way into a game. At $79, the Daydream is also more affordable than its main competitors, and is covered in soft material, making it more convenient to wear. Google Home If you want to ask help from Google without having to type on a keyboard or tap on a mobile screen, Google Home is your answer. Google Home is a voice-controlled speaker that allows you to use Google' services, even if you aren't with in front of a computer or a phone. It can answer questions, wake you up in the morning, control the thermostat, and do a lot of other tricks. This device looks a lot like Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Microsoft's Cortana. It currently works with a limited number of smart home devices such as Philips Hue bulbs and Nest, as well as IFTTT recipes. Chromecast Ultra If you want to stream 4K HDR video to your UHD TV, there is no better option than the Chromecast Ultra. It offers fast and powerful streaming in a nifty device. It also comes with an attached ethernet port built into the power adapter, allowing videos to load and play faster. With a plethora of hardware products launched in 2016, Google is definitely no longer just a software company. This was a great year for Google all in all, considering its successful entry in the hardware industry.

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     US Family Blames FaceTime For Fatal Car Crash And Sues Apple Posted: Dec 31 2016, 9:26am CST | by IANS, in News | Apple   Photo Credit: Getty Images   A family in the US who lost their young daughter in a car crash recently filed a lawsuit against Apple for allegedly encouraging distracted driving through "FaceTime" video calling app, media reported. Don't Miss: Hottest CES 2017 Announcements The family claims that Apple had the patent for a safer version of its "FaceTime" video calling app, but chose to make the less safe version available with the iPhone 6 -- ultimately leading to a car crash that resulted in the death of their five-year-old daughter Moriah Modisette, Courthouse News reported this week. The case dates back to 2014 when Moriah was traveling in the back of her parents' car near Dallas and was hit by another car driven by Garrett Willhelm who was using the Apple "FaceTime" while driving. The erring driver had confessed to the police that he was on "FaceTime" and police had also found that the app was still live when they arrived at the scene. Given the fact that the app fully engages visual components, the Modisette family blamed Apple for its failure to either program a shutoff into the "FaceTime" or give strong warning about using the app while driving. "Defendant Apple Inc. has had the technology to prevent these events, and the Modisettes' injuries, specifically since at least December 12, 2008, when it filed an application with the US Patent Office for a ‘driver handheld computing device lock-out," the family said in the complaint. The failure of Apple to use GPS tracking to detect the speed of the vehicle in which a user was traveling and shut down the "FaceTime" app was a significant factor in the accident, the family added. The grieving family has sought economic damages along with punitive damages.

Here are some of the best products that Apple released in 2016.  ( Apple ) Advertisement There are a lot of things to look forward to from Apple in 2017. Everybody is looking forward to the launch of the iPhone 8, which will coincide with the 10th anniversary of the said phone. While Apple did not exactly have a banner year, some of the products the company did release this year is nothing to sniff at. Take a look back at the best products that Apple released in 2016. iPhone 7 Plus While the iPhone 7 Plus is more of a refinement rather than a complete overhaul of the previous iPhone models, it is still one of the best premium phones that are out in the market today, and can be considered a worthy upgrade even if you are making the upgrade from iPhone 6 Plus or iPhone 6S Plus. Most people took umbrage with the fact that it did not come with a headphone jack. However, the iPhone 7 Plus is currently the best iPhone available right now. It has an improved power and battery performance. The phone is also waterproof and has two camera sensors at the back, allowing you to take photos using the portrait mode and come up with beautiful bokeh-like effects. iMac With 5K Retina Display Buying a new Mac computer is a long-term investment on your part, and will also cost you a small fortune. You don't want to be stuck with the wrong model, which is why you need to make sure that you end up with the right fit. If you are looking for a desktop computer that has a large screen and precision display, then this Mac computer is the one for you. This computer has a great Retina display, with plenty of real estate to boot. MacBook Pro 15-inch The new and improved MacBook Pro is much thinner and lighter. It also features a massive trackpad, a brighter and colorful Retina display, and an improved audio performance. The laptop also had a lot of changes that surprised a lot of people, such as the four USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports and the fancy new touchscreen at the top of the keyboard. AirPods This is the perfect accessory for people who love freedom of movement. This listening accessory instantly pairs up with your Apple device. Simply open the lid of the AirPods case near your iPhone and they're instantly connected. Sound quality has improved when compared to the EarPods, especially the bass level. However, if you are an audiophile, know that the AirPods do not offer the same quality that other dedicated music-listening headphones can provide.    Although Apple was not able to produce anything that is groundbreaking this year, most of the products featured here are very much capable machines and accessories, which will prove to be useful down the line.

In 2016, there were major strides in technology that will inevitably change the way we live life, including everything from delivery drones to self-driving cars. And 2017 promises to be just as innovative. The following is a non-comprehensive list of rumored gadgets and gizmos to get excited about for the upcoming year: Apple 1. iPhone 8: The year 2017 marks the iPhone’s tenth anniversary and Apple is said to be going all-out for this celebratory upgrade. Though Apple hasn’t made an official announcement yet, rumors suggest a radical redesign of the phone favorite. The name “iPhone 8” is purely speculation, but the phone is said to have a top-to-bottom, all-glass display. This means it would also be sans home button but have the Touch ID and camera built directly into the display. Apple is also said to be using flexible plastic OLED rather than an LCD, making the device thinner with a better display while consuming less power. The iPhone is rumored to come out in the fall of 2017. 2. iPad Upgrades: According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple is also said to be updating its iPad lineup for the spring of 2017. The new models are said to include an improved Apple Pencil stylus and a new variety of screen sizes. Google 3. New laptop running Android’s Andromeda OS: Google did quite well this year with its first phone, the Pixel. Now, according to Android Police, a website that features news, reviews and updates related to Android platforms, Google’s combined Android/Chrome ‘Andromeda’ OS will run a new laptop by Google that’s expected to launch in the fall of 2017. The computer is said to work as both a tablet and laptop. 4.Smartwatch: According to David Ruddock with Android Police, Google is expected to launch its own smartwatch as well and has heard that Google is prototyping the smartwatches. Android Police is not entirely sure when they will be released but have noted that they are 70 percent confident these watches will be released. Samsung 5. Samsung Galaxy S8: Samsung didn’t have a great year thanks to the notorious, exploding Galaxy Note 7, but this next year might be an opportunity for redemption. While tech insiders don’t know a lot about the device, the Galaxy S8 is rumored to include a digital assistant powered by Viv, the artificial intelligence startup that Samsung purchased in 2016, according to Bloomberg’s Jungah Lee. Tesla 6. Tesla Model 3: The new Tesla Model 3 vehicle comes with full autopilot hardware and can update self-driving software over the air. It’s expected to be available in late 2017 and Tesla has coined it their “most affordable car yet” at $35,000 during their unveiling event in March 2016. Microsoft 7. Virtual Reality headset with Windows 10: In 2016, Microsoft announced new virtual reality headsets that will work with a free update of Windows 10. The headsets will start at $299, a much cheaper price than what we’ve already seen when it comes to VR headsets, like the Oculus Rift at $599. Nintendo 8. Nintendo Switch: Nintendo announced the Switch in a video released in fall 2016. The Switch is a new gaming console that works on TVs and as a portable system. The Switch is expected to be released in March of 2017 but we can expect more details of the product on January 12, 2017. Snapchat 9. Snap Spectacles: Snapchat probably doesn’t immediately come to mind during a discussion of tech innovation, but the Snap Spectacles, which are already available in Venice, CA, are expected to spread in 2017. The glasses film a snapchat video from your perspective when you click a button located on the frames and then wirelessly upload to Snapchat. These could very well become a necessity for avid Snappers and are considered much easier to use than the Google Glasses before them. Healthcare 10. Remedy: This product is an app designed to make on-demand and personalized healthcare a lot simpler. The app, along with similar apps like DoctorOnDemand and HelloMD, are expected to be more widely used in 2017. The app allows patients to talk to a physician from the comfort of their own home and even be treated and prescribed medication where possible. This remote treatment will hopefully be able to relieve doctors and hospitals that become quickly overbooked. NEVER MISS A STORY!

Cherlynn Low, @cherlynnlow 12.31.16 in Wearables Comments 866 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Google; logo by L-Dopa When the first smartwatches made it to our wrists a few years ago, we were willing to overlook shortcomings because the product category was in its infancy. But the technology has had time to mature, and 2016 should have been an exciting year in this space. Instead, we saw a number of important brands pull out of the smartwatch race; meanwhile Google deferred major updates to 2017. Smaller but significant companies were swallowed by competitors, and the devices that did launch this year were unexciting at best. Smartwatch sales started to decline in the second quarter, and while the all-important holiday shopping numbers haven't been tallied yet, the future isn't looking good for the category. This year's new watches, such as the Apple Watch Series 2, the Fitbit Blaze and a slew of Android Wear watches, were mostly underwhelming, with merely incremental upgrades. Battery life continues to be unsatisfactory, the cases are usually still too thick, and companies still struggle to balance timeless design with futuristic functionality. Google, which originally planned to launch Android Wear 2.0 this year, is pushing that update to early 2017. The new version will apparently allow for apps that can run independently on smartwatches without requiring a companion phone, something that Apple's watchOS 2 has offered since fall 2015. Speaking of Apple, the Series 2 appears to be one of the few smartwatches that did well this year: It's received mostly positive reviews and appears to be selling decently well, although Apple did not respond to queries on actual sales numbers. Traditional watchmakers continued to smarten up their products this year, with one of the most notable being Tag Heuer and its fancy Connected watch. That thing costs a whopping $1,500, and it doesn't offer much more than the other Android Wear watches. Sure, it's a Tag, but when most Android Wear watches cost between $150 and $400, you realize that you're paying $1,200 more for yet another wearable that needs recharging every two days or so, with a display that's middling at best. The only established watchmakers that succeeded at producing decent devices (think Timex and Fossil) did so by avoiding going fully digital, sticking instead to more-conventional analog designs with hidden sensors for basic fitness tracking. Really, then, the watches that did well this year were the hybrids, with the one big exception being the Apple Watch Series 2. Then come the brands that have basically given up on making smartwatches altogether. A Motorola exec recently said the company is not working on a successor to last year's Moto 360, because it just doesn't "see enough pull in the market" to justify developing an updated model. That this kind of sentiment is coming from Motorola, of all companies, is telling. After all, the Moto 360 was the first Android Wear watch to have a round face and is one of the most well-received smartwatches running Google's software. Similarly, this year Microsoft discontinued its Band fitness wearable. Although it's more of an activity tracker, the Microsoft Band always toed the line, what with its color touchscreen and smartwatch-like features such as phone notifications and third-party app support. Unlike Motorola, however, Microsoft never explained its exit from the field, although it continues to support its suite of health apps that can run on other devices. One of the biggest signs that smartwatches are in trouble, though, was industry pioneer Pebble's recent acquisition by Fitbit for the modest sum of about $40 million. Back in its heyday, Pebble reportedly received bids from Citizen and Intel for $740 million and $70 million, respectively. The startup declined both suitors and went on to launch a new line of fitness-focused smartwatches this year. The Pebble 2 and Pebble Time 2 raised $12 million on Kickstarter, beating the $1 million funding goal. Despite the company's fundraising successes, Pebble failed to resolve its financial woes and eventually accepted Fitbit's offer. With so much consolidation in the smartwatch space, the future of the category looks gloomy. Less competition can mean less innovation, which can result in products growing stale and eventually fading altogether. Still, there have been developments in 2016 that could give the industry a boost. Startup Matrix Industries came up with a way to use body heat to power a smartwatch, which could eliminate (or at least alleviate) the problem of inadequate battery life. Plus, with Android Wear 2.0 slated to arrive early next year, the next generation of smartwatches will likely become more functional, giving users more reason to wear them. We also saw a few watches this year that let wearers control Amazon's Alexa from their wrist, although they ran obscure independent operating systems that barely had third-party app support. The Alexa integration means that these watches can access more than 2,000 so-called skills, letting you do things such as turn on your smart lights or thermostat, ask how much you've spent at specific stores, or buy many, many pairs of socks. You can't do most of that yet with Android Wear's OK Google command, but Alexa's expansion into watches could spur Google to improve its own assistant. So 2016 wasn't a great year for smartwatches. In fact, it was a disappointing 12 months that don't bode well for the future of the category. But there are enough upcoming potential enhancements that the industry could be revived. Components could also get smaller and more powerful over time, as they did with smartphones, eventually leading to sleeker frames housing more full-featured systems. But that's something to look forward to in the future. As for this year's smartwatches? Goodbye, and good riddance. Check out all of Engadget's year-in-review coverage right here.

But it seems fair to say that few companies have come close to matching Microsoft in the sheer breadth and scale of its accomplishments over the last twelve months. Of course, let's not get too carried away - it's not like Microsoft completely changed the world in 2016. But what we saw from the Redmond giant over this past year was a far more ambitious and more confident company than ever before, which delivered some significant improvements, and released some remarkable new products. But perhaps Microsoft's greatest achievement this year was that it got people talking about the company with genuine interest, and even excitement. Microsoft's closest rivals, by comparison, had somewhat more mixed results. Google ditched its much-loved Nexus brand and introduced its new Pixel flagship phones - but while they're certainly very capable devices, they haven't exactly reinvented the wheel when it comes to Android handsets. Another new version of Android, 7.0 Nougat, arrived as well (and now version 7.1.1 too) - but while there are some nice additions and improvements, few people have got to enjoy them so far, with only 0.4% of devices running Nougat over three months after its release. With much fanfare, Google introduced two new messaging apps in May, called Allo and Duo - but they haven't been the runaway success the company would have liked. And Google also massively scaled back its ambitions in one truly exciting area, ditching the development of its own purpose-built self-driving car, and instead realigning its efforts around creating and selling that technology to other manufacturers. Apple's year was marred by a series of disappointments. With typical bluster, it hyped up its new MacBook Pro notebooks beyond all belief - particularly the keyboard-bound Touch Bar that the company touted as some innovative, brand new idea that only Apple could think of, despite it being a refinement of old ideas tried by other companies. Aside from the underwhelming battery life (a problem that Apple solved by removing the estimated battery time indicator from its OS), the high cost of the new laptops was particularly unwelcome, given the usability nightmare that Apple created in forcing owners towards 'dongle hell', thanks to its total disregard for compatibility with other devices, including its own iPhones. Then there was the removal of the headphone jack from the new iPhones, a problem that Apple solved by launching its wireless AirPods - almost two months late - and with which some users are now reporting battery life issues. It released updates that did more harm than good, like the watchOS update that bricked Apple Watches. And of course, what everyone really wanted was new Mac desktops, which are long overdue - so naturally, Apple ignored everyone and delivered nothing on that front. It wasn't all that long ago that Microsoft was thought of as a dull, bland corporation - and to some extent, it's struggled to shake off that image, despite its considerable efforts to do so. But in 2016, Microsoft seemed to break through those antiquated perceptions like never before. In October, Mashable wrote "Admit it: Microsoft is now a braver, more innovative company than Apple", and The Verge published a similar article praising Microsoft for its more bold outlook for desktop computing. Microsoft has succeeded - to some degree - in changing how people think about the company, but it hasn't always done so for the better over the past year. In September, it announced that Windows 10 was installed on over 400 million devices - an incredible milestone, just fourteen months after its release. But that achievement came as a result of Microsoft's clumsy, heavy-handed approach to 'encouraging' Windows 7 and 8.1 users to upgrade to the new OS, using methods that won the company few friends, resulting in scathing criticism from both its customers and the media. Last week, Chris Capossela, Microsoft's chief marketing officer, admitted to Mary Jo Foley and Paul Thurrott on the Windows Weekly podcast that that approach had been "too aggressive". Microsoft also admitted in July that it would fail to meet its target of a billion Windows 10 devices by 2018. Bizarrely, the company blamed that on its phone business, despite Windows phones never having contributed any significant volumes to its device sales. Indeed, just a few months after Windows chief Terry Myerson announced that target in 2015, Microsoft wrote down $7.6 billion on its phone business, along with the loss of 7,800 jobs, in the first round of a major restructuring - and downsizing - plan. The effects of that restructuring had a devastating impact on the Windows phone platform in 2016. Microsoft launched the last of its four Windows 10 Mobile devices in February, the Lumia 650, and all four handsets are now at the end of their retail lives, having sold out in several markets, with no direct replacements on the way. Only a handful of manufacturers have so far signed up to launch Windows 10 Mobile devices, and those that did sold their handsets in meager numbers. IDC estimates that Windows' share of the global smartphone market will be just 0.4% by the end of 2016. Given that 97% of Windows 10 Mobile devices in use are Microsoft Lumias, the company's retreat from the phone hardware market doesn't bode well for its mobile ecosystem. But while things may now appear bleak for Windows handsets, the future may well be a bit brighter. Earlier this month, Microsoft made a major announcement, revealing its plans to bring the full-fat Windows 10 OS to next-generation devices with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon processors. Even more excitingly, it promised support for desktop-class 32-bit x86 applications on these devices through emulation. While many expect that to lead to more power-efficient notebooks and tablets being released in 2017, that announcement naturally led to speculation about the prospect of Microsoft's much-rumored 'Surface phone', which could arrive as early as next year. In August, Microsoft released the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, bringing it to PCs, phones, HoloLens, the Xbox One, and many more devices. Compared with the more modest November Update in 2015, the Anniversary Update was a major overhaul for the OS, bringing a vast range of new features and significant improvements, including upgrades to Cortana, a revamped Action Center, more customization features, a better Windows Ink experience, and a lot more. The update was warmly welcomed by users, although its rollout was tainted by freezing problems that affected some PCs, as well as a very unpleasant issue that disabled millions of webcams. In October, Microsoft announced details of its next major Windows 10 release, known as the Creators Update, which will also bring a broad selection of new features and enhancements to the OS when it arrives in early 2017. That announcement came alongside the launch of an exciting new device. Microsoft unveiled the Surface Studio, an all-in-one desktop PC with a focus on creativity. It features a 28-inch touchscreen with support for its Surface Pen, allowing users to draw and write directly onto the display. Microsoft earned itself widespread praise for the machine, which it says has the thinnest LCD monitor ever built. Many observers commented with surprise that Microsoft had built such a device, saying that it was the PC that Apple should have built. High praise indeed, particularly at a time when many in the creative industries have voiced displeasure at how little Apple seems to care for them these days. Along with the Surface Studio, Microsoft also introduced the Surface Dial, "a new tool for the creative process". The rotary input device can be placed directly onto the Surface Studio's display to offer quick access to context-sensitive features and menus, not just in 'creative' scenarios, but also across other types of app. The Dial is also compatible with other Windows 10 devices, to varying degrees. While Apple turns its back on some of its most loyal customers, Microsoft has been embracing users of all kinds, on all platforms. In February, it acquired cross-platform app development specialists Xamarin, and a few weeks later, it announced that those developer tools would be open-sourced and made available free to devs. It was a stunning announcement, underlining Microsoft's commitment to offering the best and most complete software development experience. That acquisition enabled Microsoft to launch Visual Studio for Mac in November, as well as rolling out a release candidate for Visual Studio 2017, and introducing the Visual Studio Mobile Center, which it described as "a mission control for mobile apps", making development for phones and tablets a smoother and less complex process. Microsoft stayed true to its commitment to embrace cross-platform development throughout 2016, not just for other developers, but also for itself. In addition to releasing all sorts of apps for iOS and Android over the last twelve months, the company raised quite a few eyebrows in November when it announced that it had joined the Linux Foundation as a platinum member. Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Foundation, said that Microsoft would now be "better able to collaborate with the open source community to deliver transformative mobile and cloud experiences to more people". Coinciding with that announcement, Microsoft also announced a public preview of SQL Server on Linux. In September, Microsoft made another hugely significant announcement - the formation of a new Artificial Intelligence and Research Group, with over 5,000 computer scientists. Earlier in the year, Microsoft's Dave Coplin had described AI as "the most important technology on the planet", adding: This technology will change how we relate to technology. It will change how we relate to each other. I would argue that it will even change how we perceive what it means to be human. Of course, after 'the Tay incident', some might say that Microsoft needs to invest as much as it can in perfecting AI ASAP... As part of its ambitions behind the new research group, Microsoft said that it planned to "build the world's most powerful AI supercomputer with Azure and make it available to anyone, to enable people and organizations to harness its power." It also promised that it will "harness AI to fundamentally change human and computer interaction through agents as Cortana". This month, the company took a big step towards exploring the full potential of its digital assistant when it announced the new Cortana Skills Kit and Devices SDK. With these new tools, companies will have the ability to connect to the assistant in more diverse ways than before, creating a much broader range of user experiences. Manufacturers will also be able to build their own devices powered by Cortana, the first of which was teased a couple of weeks ago by Harman Kardon. Microsoft's latest quarterly financial report revealed a strong set of results across many parts of its business, with a remarkable year-over-year increase of 51% in its Office 365 commercial revenue, 11% revenue growth in Dynamics, and a staggering 116% rise in revenue from its Azure cloud services, with Azure compute usage more than doubling in twelve months. Its success throughout the year pushed the company's share price to an all-time high in October, and it ended 2016 even higher than that. The markets were watching Microsoft closely in June, when it announced its purchase of professional networking platform LinkedIn, in a deal worth around $26.2 billion - its largest acquisition to date. There are some very good reasons for that acquisition, despite its enormous cost, and now that the deal has been completed, Microsoft has begun the process of integrated LinkedIn with the rest of its services. Microsoft further boosted its proposition for professionals around the world in November with the launch of Teams, a new "chat-based workspace" for Office 365, designed to take on Slack. But it hasn't been all work and no play for Microsoft over the last year. At the E3 gaming expo in June, Microsoft revealed its Xbox Play Anywhere program, enabling people to buy a game once and then play it on either their PC or Xbox One at no extra cost, rather than having to pay twice for the same title on different devices. The first Play Anywhere game was ReCore, which arrived in September, but Microsoft hopes that more games publishers will support the feature in the months and years ahead. At the same event, Microsoft also unveiled the Xbox One S, an updated (and much smaller!) version of the console that it launched in late 2013. With support for HDR and 4K video, the Xbox One S has been keenly priced in bundles starting at $299, which usually include a free game - and there have many other promotional deals since its launch to further entice buyers. That's certainly helped to boost the new console's appeal, after years of being consistently outsold by its PlayStation 4 rival. In November, combined sales of the Xbox One and One S grabbed 56% of the UK market, while in the US, Microsoft's consoles outsold the PS4 for four months in a row. But Microsoft also made one more tantalizing announcement at E3: Project Scorpio. Described as the "most powerful console ever", it will include support for native 4K gaming and virtual reality... but there's a long wait ahead, as it's not expected to arrive until the end of 2017. We'll be taking a closer look at what else we can expect from Microsoft during the year ahead in another article, but for now, let me suggest something else that you might enjoy. Rich Woods and I got together to discuss what we're looking forward to across the tech world over the next twelve months, so be sure to check that out here: Scorpio, Surface and sweet, sweet phones: A look ahead to what we're excited about in 2017.

Dai Jia-peng, the general manager of Foxconn’s automation committee, says the company has a three-phase plan in place to automate its Chinese factories using software and in-house robotics units, known as Foxbots. Foxconn produces 10,000 Foxbots a year for automation purposes The first phase of Foxconn’s automation plans involve replacing the work that is either dangerous or involves repetitious labor humans are unwilling to do. The second phase involves improving efficiency by streamlining production lines to reduce the number of excess robots in use. The third and final phase involves automating entire factories, “with only a minimal number of workers assigned for production, logistics, testing, and inspection processes,” according to Jia-peng. The slow and steady march of manufacturing automation has been in place at Foxconn for years. The company said last year that it had set a benchmark of 30 percent automation at its Chinese factories by 2020. The company can now produce around 10,000 Foxbots a year, Jia-peng says, all of which can be used to replace human labor. In March, Foxconn said it had automated away 60,000 jobs at one of its factories. In the long term, robots are cheaper than human labor. However, the initial investment can be costly. It’s also difficult, expensive, and time consuming to program robots to perform multiple tasks, or to reprogram a robot to perform tasks outside its original function. That is why, in labor markets like China, human workers have thus far been cheaper than robots. To stay competitive though, Foxconn understands it will have to transition to automation. Foxconn hopes to automate 30 percent of all factory work by 2020 Complicating the matter is the Chinese government, which has incentivized human employment in the country. In areas like Chengdu, Shenzhen, and Zhengzhou, local governments have doled out billions of dollars in bonuses, energy contracts, and public infrastructure to Foxconn to allow the company to expand. As of last year, Foxconn employed as many as 1.2 million people, making it one of the largest employers in the world. More than 1 million of those workers reside in China, often at elaborate, city-like campuses that house and feed employees. In an in-depth report published yesterday, The New York Times detailed these government incentivizes for Foxconn’s Zhengzhou factory, its largest and most capable plant that produces 500,000 iPhones a day and is known locally as “iPhone City.” According to Foxconn’s Jia-peng, the Zhengzhou factory has some production lines already at the second automation phase and on track to become fully automated in a few years’ time. So it may not be long before one of China’s largest employers will be forced to grapple with its automation ambitions and the benefits it receives to transform rural parts of the country into industrial powerhouses. There is, however, a central side effect to automation that would specifically benefit a company like Foxconn. The manufacturer has been plagued by its sometimes abysmal worker conditions and a high rate of employee suicide. So much so in fact that Foxconn had to install suicide netting at factories throughout China and take measures to protect itself against employee litigation. By replacing humans with robots, Foxconn would relieve itself of any issues stemming from its treatment of workers without having to actually improve living and working conditions or increase wages. But in doing so, it will ultimately end up putting hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people out of work. - Via: MacRumors - Source: DigiTimes More From The Verge The Verge: 2016 Yearbook The best games for your new PC or Mac The 15 best movies of 2016 Behind the scenes at Faraday Future, an electric carmaker on the brink of collapse The Verge 2016 tech report card: Facebook The best apps you didn’t know you needed for your new Android phone Now Trending CES 2017: What to expect at the biggest tech trade show of the year Olympus E-M1 Mark II review: the camera that warps time The Kissenger simulates kissing your long-distance lover This Article has a component height of 13.

The popular messaging app, which has more than a billion users worldwide, announced earlier this month that it will no longer support a range of older operating platforms by the end of the year. The changes are expected to affect millions of users globally, who use handsets including the iPhone 3GS and Windows Phone 7. WhatsApp said it will be phasing out support for older Windows, Android and Apple models by January, with the service set to end for Blackberry users and Nokia models by mid-2017. Scroll down for video  WhatsApp has announced it will be phasing out support for older Windows (centre), Android (right) and Apple (left) models by the end of 2016, and Blackberry and Nokia by mid-2017 The older smartphone platforms can no longer keep up with the latest features being rolled out for the app, claims a blog post by the Facebook-owned app.  WHICH PHONES WILL LOSE OUT? WhatsApp has announced that it will no longer support a range of older operating platforms by the end of the year. By the end of this year Whatsapp will no longer work on: - Android 2.1 and 2.2 - Windows Phone 7 - iPhone 3GS/iOS 6 In June 2017, WhatsApp will no longer be supported for: - BlackBerry - Nokia S40 - Nokia Symbian S60  WhatsApp made the announcement as it celebrated its seventh anniversary, after first launching the popular messaging platform in 2009. The app, which is now used by more than one billion people worldwide, was launched in the early days of Apple's App Store, when seven out of ten had operating systems offered by Blackberry and Nokia. However, today's smartphone market is dominated by Google, Apple and Microsoft, with almost all newer models running on these platforms. The firm wrote: 'As we look ahead to our next seven years, we want to focus our efforts on the mobile platforms the vast majority of people use.'

Share this article Share 1.5k shares Platforms being left behind include BlackBerry (pictured left), including BlackBerry 10; Nokia S40; Nokia Symbian S60 (pictured right); Android 2.1 and Android 2.2; Windows Phone 7 and iPhone 3GS/iOS 6 Whatsapp was launched in the early days of Apple's App Store, when seven out of ten had operating systems offered by Blackberry and Nokia. However, today's market is dominated by Google, Apple (iPhone pictured) and Microsoft WhatsApp said the Nokia S40 platform and application user interface software on Nokia's broad range of mid-tier feature phones will no longer be supported  The Nokia Symbian open source operating system, launched in 2007, is the oldest OS capable of running the app. HOW DO I CHECK WHICH SOFTWARE VERSION I HAVE? FOR ANDROID PHONES: Go to ‘Settings’, then select ‘About Device’, then choose ‘Software Info’, where the name of the operating system eg. 'Android 6.1' can be found FOR iPHONES Go to 'Settings', then choose 'General', then go to 'About' and scroll down to 'Version' to find the operating system eg. '10.2.1'  WhatsApp explained: 'While these mobile devices have been an important part of our story, they don't offer the kind of capabilities we need to expand our app's features in the future.' Users still on one of the listed platforms are advised to upgrade to newer Android, iPhone or Windows phone platforms.  The firm added: 'This was a tough decision for us to make, but the right one in order to give people better ways to keep in touch with friends, family, and loved ones using WhatsApp.'  In its seven years since being set up by former Yahoo! employees Jan Koum and Brian Acton in Canada, the messaging app has grown from strength to strength.  Last month, WhatsApp officially launched video calling, in a bid to compete with Apple's Facetime and Skype.  In keeping with WhatsApp's data security standards, the new video calling feature will be fully encrypted, protecting calls from being listened into.  The move comes as privacy advocates worry about the potential for stepped-up government surveillance in the US under a Trump administration. WhatsApp, which boasts more than a billion users worldwide, adopted end-to-end encryption early this year, making it technically impossible for the company or government authorities to read messages or listen to calls. FIVE WHATSAPP TRICKS THAT CAN MAKE LIFE EASIER In its seven years since being set up by former Yahoo! employees in Canada, the messaging app has grown from strength to strength See when your messages are read: Go to a chat, tap and hold on any of the messages you've sent, followed by the info option. Mute group chats: Tap on the group chat and the name to bring up 'Group Info', where you will find the option to 'Mute' the chat for eight hours to one week or even a year. Shortcuts to conversations: Tap and hold on the chat and a tab will pop up. Select the 'Add Conversation Shortcut' option and the chat in question will appear as the person's profile photo on your mobile desk top – can only be used by Android users. Send public messages privately: On the top-left hand corner just below the search bar, you'll notice a 'Broadcast Lists'.  Tap on it for the option to create a new list of contacts you want your message to go out to, and message away like you would normally. Make calls: Make sure you're using the latest version of WhatsApp. You should see a new 'Calls' tab alongside the usual 'Chats' and 'Contacts'. Just send a voice call invite to another WhatsApp user and you'll be chatting away in no time.

After reportedly getting out of the standalone monitor business, LG’s offerings, which are available in 4K and 5K varieties, might be the next best option. The fact that you can connect a single Thunderbolt 3 cable from your MacBook to the LG UltraFine 5K Display is quite compelling. Not only will this provide display output, but it will also deliver the necessary power (up to 85W) to keep your MacBook Pro — 13- or 15-inch variety — charged. We recently got our hands on the LG UltraFine 5K Display. Is it a good choice for MacBook Pro owners? Watch our hands-on video walkthrough inside to learn more. That screen… The most compelling thing about this display, of course, is its screen. At 5K, you get 5120-by-2880 native resolution, or 2560-by-1440 when using Retina mode (pixel-doubled). In other words, it’s capable of delivering the same amount of on-screen real estate as the Thunderbolt Display, but it’s Retina-enabled, which makes it a whole lot easier on the eyes. Apple starts users off with a default 2560-by-1440 pixel-doubled Retina resolution, but users have the option of customizing display resolution via macOS’ System Preferences. I find that the default resolution is the perfect balance of real estate, asset size, and crispness. The 27-inch glossy IPS display provides wide viewing angles and supports P3 wide color support just like the new MacBook Pro, along with panels that feature 500 nits of brightness. Unlike its smaller 4K brethren, the 5K display is also 10-bit, which will be great for serious video editing, photo editing, and color grading. Like all modern Apple displays, the LG display is glossy. However, I found that it did a decent job of rejecting glare from light sources in front of the unit while in use. Using Final Cut Pro X, I’m impressed by how tack sharp all of the screen assets are. I can view a 1080p video in full resolution in a relatively small window with tons of app real estate to spare. 4K videos can also be viewed in full resolution, but obviously with less app real estate. Hands-on with the LG UltraFine 5K Display Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more videos As you would expect from a good IPS display, it’s got decent off-axis viewing angles. Color shift, while still noticeable at times depending on the on screen content, is kept at a reasonable level. That said, the panel doesn’t seem to be as good as the MacBook Pro’s panel in this regard. Black levels are less impressive with this display, and I noticed backlight bleed on some of the edges when viewing what should have been a completely black screen. But how often are we staring at a completely black screen? It’s not often for most users, and I don’t think it’s something that should prevent most users from considering the display. LG’s UltraFine 5K Display supports wide color with a P3 color gamut, and 500 nits of brightness — the same specs that are found on the new MacBook Pro. I find that it does an admirable job of matching my 13-inch MacBook Pro’s display in these areas. According to LG’s documentation for the UltraFine 5K Display, there’s also an ambient light sensor included on the top bezel, next to the camera. Sadly, the current version of macOS that I’m using — 10.12.2 — doesn’t feature an “Automatically adjust brightness” setting in the panel’s Display section of System Preferences. Here’s hoping that we will see automatic brightness support implemented in a future release. Speakers Like with most displays, the built-in speakers aren’t suitable replacements for dedicated speakers, however the sound quality is better than you might expect from a pair of down-firing stereo speakers. The speakers are located underneath the bottom bezel and feature a clean-looking four port design. The biggest deficiency when it comes to sound quality on the LG UltraFine is on the low end, but the mids also suffer from muffled sound. The speakers are good enough to get you by in a pinch, but you’ll definitely want to use headphones or a standalone speaker system if sound quality is of any concern. Build quality and design The monitor comes out of the box with its base connected, which means that there are no tools that you’ll need to use. It’s ready to be connected to your MacBook Pro immediately after unboxing. The LG display is comprised primarily of black plastic, which is a stark departure from the aluminum featured on Apple’s now-discontinued Thunderbolt Display. It’s an understated design for the most part, although there is a small LG logo on the bottom bezel. The base of the stand is made out of metal, which lends it a solid foundation. However, everything else, from the stem to the display housing and bezel, is made out of dark plastic. The good news is that the build quality is a step above the typical display, and the plastic isn’t as brittle as the material used on some of the cheaper models you’ll encounter. That said, I found that the display is still somewhat prone to wobble, especially when the height is adjusted to higher levels. Granted, Apple’s Thunderbolt Display lacked height adjustment, but the LG Display is a noticeable step backward in the area of desktop stability. The display’s up and down pivot (up to 4.3-inches) is relatively smooth, but still a far cry from what I’d like to imagine that Apple would have produced if designed in-house at Cupertino. It also features positive and negative tilt to position the screen at an ideal angle. The angle adjustments aren’t as smooth as they were on the Thunderbolt Display, which isn’t exactly surprising, but it’s still several notches above the typical cheap monitor. Although you can’t orient the display vertically like you can with some monitors, you can adjust the horizontal level of the monitor head slightly. This is a feature that’s only to be used when the unit is resting on a slightly uneven surface. The UltraFine display doesn’t sport any physical buttons or joysticks, which means all adjustments are performed via macOS. There’s not even a power button to power the display on or off. When you connect a Thunderbolt 3 cable, the display comes on, and when you disconnect the cable, the display turns off. Putting the MacBook Pro to sleep immediately puts the LG display to sleep as well. Think of it as a true extension to your MacBook Pro, and not so much a separate peripheral. Accessories The LG UltraFine 5K Display comes with a power cable, a lengthy 6-foot+ long Thunderbolt 3 cable, and a VESA cover. The display’s stand can be detached via the switch on the rear, which allows users to mount the stand on a VESA arm using the provided VESA cover. And since the display features an integrated power supply, there’s no power brick to fool with, which helps promote a clean setup. A lack of ports Unfortunately, the display is quite anemic when it comes to additional ports, and this is where it fails to live up to the comparatively generous Thunderbolt Display. Outside of the one Thunderbolt port, which is used to connect your 2016 MacBook Pro, LG only provides three downstream USB-C ports, and these ports are USB 3.1 (gen 1) only, which means a maximum bandwidth of 5Gbps. That’s right, there are no USB-A ports, no SD Card slot, and the USB-C ports are glorified USB 3.0 ports. The port situation is somewhat disappointing. The most obvious reason is that the new MacBook Pro itself is lacking in ports, so it would have been nice to have the UltraFine Display help pick up the slack. But not only that, the ports that are there are slow by today’s standards. Since DisplayPort 1.2, which is bundled with Thunderbolt 3, only supports a maximum resolution of 4K at 60Hz, LG and Apple had to work around this limitation. It’s similar to how Apple had to use its own custom timing controller for its 5K iMac, but exact details have yet to be revealed as to what LG had to do to make this display a reality. From what I can gather, it looks like the monitor is using two streams and stitching them together to make one 5K image. This becomes apparent when closing the lid on the MacBook Pro, and the monitor briefly flickers and shows the two separate images. The lack of an extra Thunderbolt 3 port means that daisy-chaining other devices to this monitor is not a possibility. You’ll need to either put the LG display at the tail end of the chain, or connect to it with a separate Thunderbolt 3 cable. And what if you’re a 15-inch MacBook Pro owner wishing to drive dual 5K displays? You’ll need to use two Thunderbolt 3 cables coming from each side of the MacBook Pro to drive such a setup. Users with older Macs devoid of Thunderbolt 3 will still be able to connect to the display using a dongle, albeit at a lower resolution. Windows users are in a similar boat; the display works, but not at 5K. Integration is key The display may be lacking in ports, but you do get some built-in amenities that might otherwise require added peripherals. On the top bezel you’ll find a 1080p USB camera (with indicator light), and a USB microphone, which makes the display adequate for handling FaceTime calls without any additional equipment. Although the inclusion of a the camera and other equipment increases the size of the upper bezel slightly — cue the “fivehead” comments — it is a considerable plus to have a built-in camera and microphone to facilitate voice and video calls. Some people will loathe the unbalanced top-heavy look of the bezel, but it’s not something that bothered me much during actual usage. When connected to the LG UltraFine Display, users can adjust screen brightness directly from the macOS’ System Preferences. This means there’s no need to finagle with manual buttons or joysticks just to modify the display’s brightness or volume, for instance. I wish there was an easy-to-use Touch Bar shortcut for adjusting the brightness of the external display right from my MacBook Pro’s keyboard, but the Control+Brightness Up/Down shortcut seems to work okay in the meantime. Conclusion The LG UltraFine 5K Display is a solid offering, that’s a decent purchase at $974. Remember that you’re getting an excellent panel, and the only other standalone 5K display available for purchase is one from Dell that’s significantly pricier, older, and doesn’t use Thunderbolt 3. You won’t find the same design polish that you’d find on an Apple-branded monitor, but LG’s offering is generally better than the typical third-party monitor. The one-cable connection, and integration with FaceTime make it a good solution for new MacBook Pro owners who want something that just works. But some of you will probably be disappointed that the display lacks more port options, and the lack of any on-device buttons for brightness control is a little annoying until Apple provides a better software solution in macOS. LG also offers a 4K version of its UltraFine display as well. Both displays are on sale for a limited time at $524.00 and $974.00 respectively. The 4K version lacks support for Thunderbolt 3, but can still provide single cable connectivity via a USB-C cable. The 4K version also lacks the 10-bit panel, camera, and only provides 60W of power, which means that it won’t have enough power to charge a 15″ MacBook Pro at full speed. To add more insult to injury, the 4K model is only capable of supporting USB 2.0 speeds on its downstream USB ports, which means that you’ll only want to connect things like mice, keyboards, and other low-bandwidth accessories. Personally speaking, if I had to choose between these two displays and money weren’t an absolute deciding factor, I’d go with the 5K version, hands-down. LG’s UltraFine 5K display is currently available for order on Apple’s online store, but ship dates are still a few weeks out. The 4K variety is now available for purchase in some local Apple retail stores, but it’s backordered several weeks out online as well. Fortunately, Apple has extended its hefty discounts on both displays until March 31st, so you still have plenty of time to order one before the price goes back up.

Photo Credit: AP advertisement | advertise on newsday Continuing supply problems and relatively weak demand for the iPhone 7 will lead Apple to cut its production, the Nikkei Asian Review reported Friday. Citing data from Apple's suppliers, Nikkei estimated that production of Apple's flagship mobile device would decrease 10 percent in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period a year earlier. advertisement | advertise on newsday When Apple released its latest earnings report in October, CEO Tim Cook addressed the supply and demand issues, which he said were interrelated. The drop in demand was mostly a result of a shift in Chinese consumers' buying habits: people in China were quick to upgrade to the iPhone 6s, a surge that was much larger than the demand increase following the iPhone 5s, and not something that Apple was able to replicate with the iPhone 7. Why the drop in Chinese upgraders? Cook cited several factors, including a challenging foreign exchange rate environment that has resulted in manufacturing supply shortages. Indeed, Nikkei reported that a shortage of camera sensors has curbed Apple's ability to meet demand for the iPhone 7, which has two rear cameras in addition to the front shooter. A production cut signals that Apple isn't immune to the forces that have been shaping the broader smartphone market in 2016. Several analysts predicted that overall smartphone growth would slow this year, with Gartner speculating that the era of double-digit growth is over. TechnologyiPhone through the years But Strategy Analytics reported that smartphone makers around the world peddled 375.4 million units in the third quarter of 2016, up from 354.2 million units a year earlier. It was the industry's fastest growth rate for a year, and the firm expected a higher growth rate for the rest of 2016 than originally forecast. advertisement | advertise on newsday This article originally appeared on PCMag.com.    Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

People barely utter a line of Auld Lang Syne and tech pundits have already flooded the internet with Apple predictions for 2017. The iPhone 8 (or possibly 7s)! New iPads! Craig Federighi’s hair gaining sentience! Yet short of Tim Cook driving Apple off a cliff rather than continuing to make the money needed to produce an actual Apple car (that Maps will drive off a cliff), 2017 will undoubtedly see the usual revisions to Apple hardware and services. So rather than give you the same list as everyone else, we’re thinking about what we want from Apple in 2017 rather than just what we’ll probably get. 1) Release new desktop Macs A new MacBook Pro arrived in November, but the only other Mac updated in 2016 was the MacBook. Desktops? Nada. The most recent iMac revision happened in October 2015. The Mac Mini? 2014. The Mac Pro Phil Schiller got all excited about (“Can’t innovate any more, my ass!”)? No change for over 1000 days. In a recent memo to Apple staff, Tim Cook said “we have great desktops in our roadmap”. We’re glad to hear it. Refining a product line is one thing, but only having two Mac options is taking things a bit too far. 2) Don’t forget the little guys Bar capacity alterations, the iPad mini hasn’t been updated in over a year. We doubt it’ll get all the goodies found in the iPad Pros, but we hope 2017 will bring at least a processor bump, to ensure it’ll run all the latest apps. But the smaller Apple product we’re more concerned about is the iPhone SE. With the guts of a 6S in a 5S case, it brought a powerful small iPhone back to the line-up. It shouldn’t languish – although rather than an update, we’d sooner see Apple kill two birds with one stone by eradicating the bezel from the iPhone 8. Read more Apple iPhone SE review 3) Realise thin isn’t the only way Apple’s obsession with thin continues unabated. Rumour has it when Phil Schiller’s angry, he uses MacBooks like shuriken, embedding them into walls and the occasional intern. But, you know, our Apple kit’s thin enough now, thanks. We’d like Apple to think different. We’d happily choose extra battery life on the next iPhone or notebook rather than shaving a fraction of a millimetre from its form. And we don’t care if our iMac’s a bit flabby if we can still install extra RAM. 4) Give everyone a Touch Bar The jury’s still out on some aspects of the MacBook Pro Touch Bar – we doubt too many people will be using it to mix records, for example. But as a context-sensitive shortcuts bar and to bring Touch ID to the Mac, it’s great. A pity, then, you can’t get one for a desktop Mac – unless Apple somehow magics up its Magic Keyboard a bit more. With Touch Bar essentially being a tiny touchscreen device itself, we shudder at the cost of such an accessory, but, hey, Apple’s never shied away from expensive kit. You might also like MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review 5) Reenergise creatives Not everyone wants to make things, but artists, musicians and other creative types often inspire people. They formed the backbone of Apple’s comeback advertising campaign in the late 1990s, and also kept the Mac platform afloat during its darkest years. Increasingly, though, we hear of creatives – comic artists; web developers – heading elsewhere. Not a flood as yet, but more than a trickle. We’re hoping 2017 will find Apple cementing its appeal with such people, so the platform doesn’t end up with people merely aspiring to be a hipster in a coffee shop, tapping away on a notebook with a fruit logo on its lid. Why it matters Surface Studio is Microsoft's draw-on desktop for creatives 6) Get more telly on our telly We fired up our Apple TV on a US account and there was the new TV app, asking us to add all our channels. In the UK: nothing. In fact, in the year since the new Apple TV’s release, the UK’s only received a half-hearted BBC iPlayer app, and a port of NOW TV’s earlier one, which appears to have been abandoned. It’s no surprise Apple’s US-centric, but in 2017 we hope it’ll investigate what the hold-up is in bringing more British telly to the Apple TV. The lack of apps is bonkers, not least considering they’re all already on iOS (and thereby relatively trivial to port) and – more importantly – the rival (and significantly cheaper) Fire TV Stick. Read more New Amazon Fire TV Stick adds Alexa voice control to the mix 7) Make iOS go pro There’s sort of a tick-tock cycle to iOS, with the iPad getting major new features every other major update. On that basis, iOS 11 should receive some iPad-specific features – and we certainly hope so, because we need an iOS Pro. The current Home screen set-up looks ridiculous on a larger iPad. Split View was a great start, but the app picker remains atrocious, making it nightmarish to find apps if you’ve more than a handful installed. And why can’t we ask Siri to launch pairs of apps side by side to circumvent the fiddly Split View set-up entirely? You might also like Tech Resolutions #1: why I'm swapping my MacBook for an iPad Pro 8) Get more people buying apps Given the way the industry has gone coupled with people’s sense of entitlement, we’re not sure how Apple will be able to fix everyone wanting apps for free. But when we see great products like Status Board discontinued, the developer saying there’s “not a lot of overlap right now between ‘pro’ and ‘iOS’”, that’s a big concern. If Apple sees iPad as the future, it needs to double down on the present, normalising spending a decent chunk of change on quality productivity apps, and ensuring it prominently features them whenever possible.

Yes, we know Apple’s giddy about an uptick in its ’services’ bottom line, part of which is people paying for iCloud storage upgrades. But when this negatively impacts on user experience, there’s a problem. Right now, lots of people hit their limit and don’t back up. They even stop taking photos. Even more bafflingly, schools that use iPads can’t upgrade, meaning students run out of space – hardly surprising when armed with kit that shoots 4K video. At the very least, Apple should make the 50 GB tier free for schools. 10) Kill Lightning Yeah, we said it. And, yeah, we know it’d be painful to go through donglegeddon again. But connectivity across Apple products is an illogical mess. For a company that prizes simplicity and elegance, it’s ridiculous you can’t use iPhone headphones with your new MacBook Pro, or USB-C anything with your iPhone. On Macs, Apple’s betting heavily on USB-C, so let’s take iOS along for the ride. And although we know that will hit Apple in the bank account (Lightning being quite the earner), it’s the right thing to do for a company that professes to put the user experience above everything else.

Now we turn to the world of technology to see what trends have been developing in the technology sector over the past year. From an ever-widening scope of business activities being pursued by Silicon Valley’s largest firms to growing government authority over one sector of Internet services, there have been plenty of interesting stories playing out on the stage of America’s tech sector. Tech Giants Grow Their Footprint with Consumers, from Autonomous Vehicles to Grocery Delivery Remember the Standard Oil octopus? On September 7th, 1904, a drawing by political cartoonist Udo J. Keppler wa published in Puck, a humor magazine published between 1871 and 1918. The cartoon, titled “Next!”, depicted the Standard Oil conglomerate as a storage tank with tentacles that wrapped around the steel, shipping and copper industries and multiple government institutions, with one tentacle reaching towards the White House. It’s doubtful that we’ll see a return to U.S. antitrust law as a major legal development, but the comparison to early 20th century conglomerates might strike a parallel with the activities of Silicon Valley tech multinationals. Consider Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent holding company of Google and a host of other small to midsize tech developers. Coverage of Alphabet’s patent application filings has rendered insights into autonomous vehicle, wind turbine and satellite technologies developed within that corporation. Both Google and e-commerce giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) made moves this year to expand online shopping services to fresh grocery delivery. Amazon itself has been making the transition from e-commerce platform to consumer electronics developer in recent years and has seen success with products like the Kindle, Alexa and the Amazon Echo. At the start of the year, it looked like many of the top tech firms were on pace to have record years in terms of patent grants earned. Through the first quarter of 2016, Samsung Electronics (KRX:005930) earned more than 2,000 U.S. patents and IBM (NYSE:IBM) earned nearly as many, both companies earning patents at a rate that would outstrip their 2015 totals. Increased patent filings among Silicon Valley’s Big 5 (Google, Amazon, Microsoft Corporation [NASDAQ:MSFT], Facebook Inc. [NASDAQ:FB], and Apple Inc. [NASDAQ:AAPL]) since 2009 highlight the increased investment these companies are making in building their patent portfolios. According to Innography’s patent analysis tools, Samsung has earned 9,701 U.S. patents through 2016, IBM has earned 8,008 U.S. patents, Microsoft earned 3,329 U.S. patents and Apple earned 2,712 U.S. patents; it should be noted that these totals include design patents which aren’t included in some annual U.S. patent tallies, like those provided by the Intellectual Property Owners Association. Cloud and cognitive computing platforms continue to be major focal areas for these tech firms. Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform earned an important industrial partner this July in the Predix industrial Internet service developed by General Electric (NYSE:GE). Microsoft’s acquisition of LinkedIn, announced this June, was the largest such corporate purchase in Microsoft’s history and instantly makes it a big player in the social media space. IBM has been putting a lot of focus into its Watson cognitive computing technology, a platform which began moving into the healthcare sector this year through collaboration with Bausch & Lomb on an app useful for performing better cataract surgeries. Virtual Reality Inches Closer to Becoming a Consumer Reality For decades now, the world of consumer technology has been breathlessly awaiting the advent of virtual reality (VR) technologies which can take a human user and immerse that person in a digital environment. At the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show there were several major tech firms exhibiting VR, from Google Cardboard’s open source VR platform to a Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) partnership on a VR platform powered by the Snapdragon 820 processor. Perhaps the first major foray for any tech developer into the VR consumer market has been made by Samsung, which released the Gear VR mobile headset developed in partnership with Facebook’s Oculus VR in November 2015. This May, Oculus announced that more than one million people used a Gear VR headset during the month of April to access some form of virtual reality content. Other virtual reality news coming from the tech sector this year supports the idea that some highly recognizable tech companies should be releasing VR platforms in the not-so-distant future. Microsoft, which has been working on the development of its HoloLens mixed reality platform, announced a new holoportation 3D capture technology implemented through the HoloLens to create social gathering spaces in VR environments. At Facebook’s recent F8 developer’s conference this past April, corporate executives unveiled a 10-year plan for the social media outlet which included new 3D video editing technologies for easier sharing of virtual reality experiences among Facebook friends. Also in April, we reported on a patent application filed by Apple for a VR headset which could integrate with a portable electronic device. Social Media Shows a Poor Ability to Deal With Major Platform Issues Even as more Americans join social media, it seems as though they just can’t stand what they’re seeing once they get there. The annual American Consumer Satisfaction Index released this June showed that customer satisfaction with social media dropped across the board with the biggest losers being Facebook, which dropped 9 percent, and Twitter Inc. (NYSE:TWTR), which lost 8 percent in the customer satisfaction index. Privacy concerns were cited as one of the major issues facing customer satisfaction with social media. And yet privacy is only one of a slew of issues rocking social media this year, especially Facebook. That particular social media firm has been dogged by many issues related to its Trending News section. In May, media outlets were reporting on an anti-conservative bias playing out at the company’s poorly managed editorial division, which some anonymous reports criticized as enabling censorship and for having a poor working environment. Facebook did the best it could to rid itself of human biases by eliminating human workers and instead employing a algorithm to spot trending articles, but by this September that too was derided for enabling the spread of fake news stories. As if promoting unsubstantiated news reports wasn’t bad enough, other news this year indicates that Facebook is used to conduct one-third of the world’s illicit weapons sales. For its part, Twitter was slammed earlier this year for its inability to prevent illicit drug sales through its own social media platform. Facebook, Twitter and others have also consented to a charge from the European Commission to rid their platforms of hate speech but that effort faces issues in the face of U.S. attitudes on free speech. FCC Increases Regulatory Control Over ISPs Amid Growing Dissent Another major story affecting the tech world this year was an increasing regulatory regime building at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the waning days of the Obama Administration. FCC wrested regulatory control over Internet service providers (ISPs) from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) back in 2015 through the agency’s Open Internet Order which reclassified ISPs as common carriers under U.S. telecommunications law. The net neutrality rules invoked by the FCC in its Open Internet Order were upheld this June in a court decision from the District of Columbia Court of Appeals (D.C. Cir.) which agreed with the FCC on the classification of ISPs as Title II common carriers. Emboldened by this new power over ISPs, the FCC has pushed a few measures during 2016 in order to further rein in ISPs. This March, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler released a draft of broadband privacy rules which sought to control how ISPs could use consumer data, especially where advertising was concerned. These privacy rules were the subject of a July hearing of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science & Transportation in which representatives of the FTC and the cable industry both raised dissents over the lack of consumer harm in triggering the new rulemaking. Despite these criticisms, the FCC passed broadband privacy rules this October which allows ISP customers to opt-out of data collection techniques used for advertising purposes. By the end of the year, however, a tidal change in opinions regarding the FCC’s oversight of ISPs seemed to at least begin. In February, the FCC’s board of commissioners also approved set-top box rules proposed by Wheeler which would require set-top box companies to provide information to competing app developers, giving them the ability to create apps for those set-top box platforms. But by September, one of the FCC commissioners voting in favor of the rules was wondering aloud as to whether the FCC had the authority to implement such rules. The FCC’s Title II common carrier classification could come into even further scrutiny with the planned merger of AT&T (NYSE:T) and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX). The vertical merger puts Time Warner’s content development businesses under the same corporate umbrella as one of the country’s largest mobile services provider. If AT&T were to take content from HBO or other Time Warner entertainment divisions and provide it to their wireless consumers at a lower cost compared to other content providers, it could be considered a zero rating practice which runs afoul of FCC net neutrality rules.

China is where development of cutting edge VR technology takes place right now, not US (unless Trump fixes US patent system somehow so that small US startups can use it again – then we are back in business) I’m sitting on 2 provisional applications for VR tech and still can’t decide if I should file them or not – so badly I’ve been burned in the past Post a Comment Respectfully add to the discussion.

If you’re at all curious about whether or not your new iPhone can withstand machine gun fire or a free-fall drop from 1,000 feet in the air, rest assured that someone on YouTube has already filmed and uploaded such an experiment. Don't Miss: Google’s Pixel copied more than just the iPhone’s design That said, we can always appreciate when someone comes up with an original and fresh way to put the iPhone’s famed build quality to the test. And right before the new year, we stumbled across a video from the appropriately named YouTube channel TheBackyardScientist that shows us what happens when you drop a perfectly fine iPhone into molten aluminum. Right from the get-go, things take an interesting turn as the iPhone immediately bursts into flames. And while the iPhone is clearly toast, there is something curiously mesmerizing about this particular method of destruction.

Two groundbreaking pairs of cans were introduced by an unlikely suspect, but with each of them commanding a four-figure price, those breakthroughs might as well not have happened for most people. Apple catalyzed the move toward wireless technology with its omission of a headphone jack in the iPhone 7, while a bunch of smaller players launched terrific wired options that fit into most people’s budgets. So just as it starts to seem like headphones are reaching a peak of consistently high quality, the tech industry is flipping everything on its head and giving us reason to consider buying yet more stuff. Focal’s headphones set new standards for what we can expect at their price points Firstly, we have to talk about the Focal Elear and Utopia. Yes, one of them costs $999 and the other one costs $3,999 (does it matter which is which?) but what they lack in affordability they make up for in having absolutely superb sound quality. French company Focal is much better known for making speakers than headphones, but their debut at the high end of the latter category has been nothing short of triumphant. Both headphones set new standards for what we can expect at their price points. And the reason mere mortals should care is that, beside the exotic materials, Focal has developed a lot of technological knowhow with these cans that the company’s designers say will inform their more affordable products in the future. Even if you never buy a pair, these headphones are a great harbinger of what’s to come. The default expectation for premium headphones will be that they’re wireless Apple’s iPhone 7 headphone jack removal was leaked in January, so naturally tech media spent most of the year debating the reasons the company might have for removing a standard and universally used port. Adopting the Lightning port for audio has some technical advantages, but Apple’s eventual launch made it clear that the company just wanted to push wireless forward. Headphone makers have responded accordingly, with everyone doubling down on wireless models, from Bose’s QC35 to B&W’s P7 Wireless. The most significant effect of 2016 on this front is that it simply sets the stage for what is likely to be a transformative 2017. At some point in the next year, the default expectation for premium headphones will be that they’re wireless. Those that cost upwards of $200 and still retain a wire will have to justify their existence through better sound quality or some other advantage. At the very bottom of the headphone market, Chinese mobile manufacturers made positive noise this year with some very nice introductions. Xiaomi’s established Pistons line kept the $20 market full of good tunes, and OnePlus joined with its massively improved Bullets v2 at the same price point. Meizu’s EP51 showed up as an excellent $65 pair of wireless sports buds, and premium smartphones finally started bundling premium earphones by default, such as with the Nubia Z11. HTC’s audio-focused Android flagship for this year, the 10, also came with some high-quality buds in the box, and LG’s QuadBeats have been consistently good for years. The best all-around headphones launched in 2016, except for Focal’s unattainable duo, were Bang & Olufsen’s second-generation Beoplay H6. They strike the perfect balance between fun and faithful sound, and their design is as sophisticated as it is comfortable and lightweight. The only problem for the H6 going forward? Everyone shopping in their price bracket in 2017 will be hoping to ditch the wire. — Vlad Savov Verge 2016 Report Card: Headphones B 2016 Grade Gold Stars: Focal raised the bar for high-end headphones Sound quality advanced across all price ranges The neckbuds trend died a quiet death Apple’s W1 wireless chip is a real boon for simplifying Bluetooth pairing Needs Improvement: Outside of Apple, wireless connections are still a pain Gaming headsets remain mostly awful Phone makers that drop the headphone jack need to better explain why they’re doing it Streaming music For most music listeners, 2016 will be remembered as the year exclusive releases complicated all our lives. It will also be remembered as the year that access to streaming services became a necessity. At the beginning of the year, the only guaranteed exclusive release on the horizon was Drake’s Views, which was a part of the deal the musician signed with Apple Music in 2015. But most fans didn’t expect that the onslaught of exclusive content would become Apple Music’s primary tool for chasing down Spotify, or Tidal’s fight for continued existence. Following nearly every major album announcement in the past year, fans have had to find out if they will have access to the music through their current streaming service, or if they will need to pay and switch providers. Drake, Beyoncé, Chance The Rapper, Rihanna, Frank Ocean, Kanye West, Gucci Mane, The 1975, Future, YG, 2 Chainz, DJ Khaled, and many other artists released exclusive albums on either Apple Music or Tidal this year. For fans, exclusive releases became a burden Those deals worked out well for artists (they got paid), streaming services (who acquired more subscribers), and labels (the streaming services paid for marketing), but when it came to the fans, exclusive releases became a burden. Despite the inconvenience for consumers, exclusives did help bring in more users and increased engagement for streaming services. Apple Music reached 20 million subscribers a few weeks ago, after just 18 months in the market. Tidal topped 3 million subscribers, which isn’t much compared to Apple or Spotify, but far more than most expected the service to attract. SoundCloud, Amazon, and Pandora entered an already crowded field, each announcing on-demand services to compete with the incumbents. And Spotify crossed the 100 million user mark in June and topped 40 million paying subscribers in September, cementing its spot as the biggest streaming service in the world without even participating in the exclusives game. Exclusives also benefitted listeners in ways many didn’t expect. Garth Brooks, who has notoriously kept his music off streaming music platforms and iTunes for years, signed an exclusive deal with Amazon’s streaming service. Frank Ocean’s deal with Apple Music allowed him to release Blonde — after a very extended delay — independently, and reap the financial benefits. It also caused his old label Universal Music Group to ban exclusives — which could mark the beginning of the end for the music industry’s favorite trend, and allow listeners to stick with one streaming service going forward.. While 2016 may have been an inconvenient year for some music fans, right now it doesn’t seem like exclusives will be a permanent fixture in the music industry going forward. Yes, Drake’s relationship with Apple will continue and you can expect the next Beyoncé album to arrive on Tidal if it’s still around, but from all indications 2016 was the peak of exclusives. Now it’s time to settle in. — Micah Singleton Verge 2016 Report Card: Streaming music B- 2016 Grade Gold Stars: More services, more users, more competition Lower priced streaming offerings from Amazon and Pandora Needs Improvement: Less exclusives UI improvements still needed for Spotify, Apple Music, and Tidal In this Storystream The Verge 2016 tech report card The Verge 2016 tech report cards: Virtual reality, TV, and apps The Verge 2016 tech report cards: Headphones and streaming music The Verge 2016 tech report cards: Cameras and gadgets View all 15 stories More From The Verge The Verge: 2016 Yearbook The best games for your new PC or Mac The 15 best movies of 2016 Behind the scenes at Faraday Future, an electric carmaker on the brink of collapse The Verge 2016 tech report card: Facebook The best apps you didn’t know you needed for your new Android phone Now Trending CES 2017: What to expect at the biggest tech trade show of the year Olympus E-M1 Mark II review: the camera that warps time Dell has turned one of the best Windows laptops into a 2-in-1 hybrid The Kissenger simulates kissing your long-distance lover Donald Trump says 'no computer is safe' This Article has a component height of 43.

The family claims that Apple had the patent for a safer version of its "FaceTime" video calling app, but chose to make the less safe version available with the iPhone 6 -- ultimately leading to a car crash that resulted in the death of their five-year-old daughter Moriah Modisette, Courthouse News reported this week. The case dates back to 2014 when Moriah was travelling in the back of her parents' car near Dallas and was hit by another car driven by Garrett Willhelm who was using the Apple "FaceTime" while driving. The erring driver had confessed to the police that he was on "FaceTime" and police had also found that the app was still live when they arrived at the scene. Given the fact that the app fully engages visual components, the Modisette family blamed Apple for its failure to either programme a shutoff into the "FaceTime" or give strong warning about using the app while driving. "Defendant Apple has had the technology to prevent these events, and the Modisettes' injuries, specifically since at least December 12, 2008, when it filed an application with the US Patent Office for a 'driver handheld computing device lock-out," the family said in the complaint. The failure of Apple to use GPS tracking to detect the speed of the vehicle in which a user was travelling and shut down the "FaceTime" app was a significant factor in the accident, the family added. The grieving family has sought economic damages along with punitive damages.

Apple has seen a drop in sales of the iPhone over the last couple of years. The company had to reduce production of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus by about 30 percent last year to cope with the dip in sales. Now, a report from Nikkei has revealed that Apple could cut back up to 10 percent production of the new iPhones this time. Interestingly, Apple had already reduced the initial production orders of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus by 20 percent to avoid a similar situation to that of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. The slowing down of the global smartphone market is one of the reasons why Apple might need to reassess its orders. Parts suppliers from Japan are likely to be affected by the order cutback, as Apple is one of the biggest customers for many component manufacturers. However, they seem to be preparing for such situations by widening their focus to include other customers in addition to the iPhone-maker.

Surprising no one, Apple had a busy Christmas morning, and I'm not talking about Tim Cook giddily opening that new Lego Batman set he's been asking for. The Mac maker's activation servers were working overtime, as all those gifted iPhones and iPads were turned on for the first time. Flurry Analytics estimates that Apple grabbed an impressive 44 percent of mobile device activations from Dec. 19 to Dec. 25., more than double the 21 percent that Samsung grabbed over the same time frame. Huawei ranked No. 3 with 3 percent of activations, and LG's 2 percent earned it the No. 4 spot. This year Hanukkah and Christmas had an overlap, with Hanukkah starting on Dec. 24. Flurry's estimates cover the week leading up to Christmas as well as the first two nights of the Jewish holiday.  Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week The analytics specialist also notes that Huawei and LG were able to earn their respective spots through sheer volume. Both companies offer a plethora of different devices, including low-cost models, that collectively boosted each manufacturer's rankings. Neither Huawei nor LG had a specific model rank particularly highly. The Apple logo displayed on the back of an iPhone, London, August 3. Carl Court/Getty Images The (continued) rise of the phablet The ongoing trend toward large devices and phablets is only gaining momentum. You may recall all the pressure that was on Apple circa 2012-13 to come out with a bigger iPhone, to which Apple's initial response was to launch an entire marketing campaign about one-handed use.

And last year, Hanukkah was in early December and ended before Flurry's measurement period. Assuming that Apple indeed gets a Hanukkah boost, Apple fared slightly worse when you factor in the timing difference—5 whole percentage points lower for the year that included two days of Hanukkah. Here's the rub: Flurry's estimates only account for percentages, and say nothing of absolute volumes. While it's undoubtedly encouraging that Apple is still the top manufacturer by a healthy margin in terms of holiday device activations, the company's iPhone sales this quarter are very much in question right now. There have been plenty of reports that iPhone demand is waning and that the iPhone 7 cycle may not be as strong as in years past, which makes sense given Apple's seemingly peaking iPhone sales in fiscal 2016. Investors will know in less than a month, when Apple reports fiscal first-quarter earnings at the end of January.

Try switching browsers Facebook Twitter 200 Email Print Comments 0 hello Article to: (required) Article from: (required) Add a message (optional) Success - Article sent! close According to Consumer Reports, there are battery-life issues with new MacBook Pro models. So what should people who've already bought (and maybe unwrapped) a MacBook Pro do? Try using a browser that isn't Apple's own Safari. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     Consumer Reports has some bad news for anyone who bought a MacBook Pro this holiday season: it's not giving Apple's new MacBook Pro laptops its seal of approval for the first time ever. According to the Consumer Reports review, there are battery-life issues with the 13-inch MacBook without the new Touch Bar control strip, and the 13- and 15-inch models with the Touch Bar. They all threw up wildly inconsistent battery times in testing. On some trials, the laptops gave out battery life readings that exceeded Apple's own 10-hour estimate. But in other trials, the laptops had less than half of what Apple promises; in one case, the 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar ran for a paltry 3.45 hours. The average of the test totals seem to be in-line with Apple's 10-hour estimate, but that would be cold comfort to someone whose laptop dies on the first leg of a cross-country flight. So, the publication decided to rate the laptops using their shortest battery life times, which dragged down the computers' overall scores. But while the laptops "did very well in measures of display quality and performance," wrote Consumer Reports' Jerry Beilinson, that wasn't enough to outweigh the battery issues. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. So what should people who've already bought (and maybe unwrapped) a MacBook Pro do? There is a bright spot in the Consumer Reports article: try using a browser that isn't Apple's own Safari. When Consumer Reports testers ran their trials using Google's Chrome browser, they found that the laptops had "consistently high" battery life. Unfortunately for Apple, those Chrome tests don't count -- part of Consumer Reports' testing criteria is that it only uses the default browser to score devices. That would flip the conventional wisdom on browsers and Mac battery life; using Safari instead of Chrome is often recommended to improve your battery life. It's not clear why that has changed with these models. Switching browsers may help in the short-term, but doesn't explain why Consumer Reports found the laptop batteries so inconsistent in its official tests; it could hint at a larger underlying problem. Still, it may at least give Apple users who've already paid big money for these computers a way to avoid these battery life problems. Consumer Reports's review follows on the heels of some complaints by MacBook Pro users who have had issues with the battery life of Apple's newest laptops since they hit shelves in October. I haven't experienced battery life problems on the Touch Bar-less laptop Apple has provided for me, but 9 to 5 Mac, running a battery test trial on one Touch Bar model, found a battery life of 8 hours for the 13-inch model. Its reviewer also reported a 6-hour battery life for the 15-inch model. Apple responded -- sort of -- to user complaints by removing the part of the battery indicator that shows the "time remaining" in a laptop's charge, saying that those estimates can be inaccurate. But, it said, there was no issue with the computers' battery life in general. The company is also already running a small replacement program for short-lived batteries on some iPhones.

By Ross Rubin | December 31, 2016 -- 12:59 GMT (04:59 PST) | Topic: Apple It was certainly a year of ups and downs for Apple, which took steps to shore up many of its products outside the core iOS portable offerings. The Apple Watch got a new user interface, but the smartwatch category drags. Apple TV got a new content navigation app (but not an integrated Apple television service). The redesigned MacBook, of course, got a wee strip of touchy goodness. Even the EarPods evolved into a game-changing wireless successor. But while Apple delivered on its annual iPhone update, there wasn't much beyond a revised Home button with an odd click feel and dual cameras that have been cropping up elsewhere. The year ahead Meet 2017's hot new smartphone brands The future of robotics What's top of mind for the CIO So much change in store for storage Smartphones: What's in the pipeline? Make your digital strategy a success in 2017 Catastrophic botnet to smash social media networks Can more meta thinking free us from current malaise? Why businesses can't ignore the cloud market IT spending to rebound in 2017, led by software, services While nagging accusations of innovation slowdown have the company defending its pursuit of artificial intelligence and continuing to investigate "interesting areas" such as self-driving cars and augmented reality, here are some simple wins based largely on its competitive environment today. Revitalize the iPhone. Apple is more than an iPhone company. But when it comes to revenue contribution, no other product it offers even comes close. As we approach its 10th anniversary and smartphone penetration grows, competitive challenges to the iPhone have never been greater. Google itself is attacking from the high-end and midrange phones released from Chinese manufacturers look increasingly impressive. Rumors have swirled that the next-generation iPhone may have more efficient processors, have an even larger display (bucking mainstream screen downsizing) or used curved glass or plastic but, without further details, those would appear to just be following other companies' leads. However, after the apparent USB-C stopgap that was the Lightning connector, it would be nice to see Apple push wireless charging further mainstream. Expand Siri integration. In 2016, Apple took steps to turn some of its key apps into platforms of their own. iMessage was one natural choice for this given the year's focus on chatbots. But the one that likely has even greater potential is Siri, Apple's voice agent that in many ways started the AI obsession tsunami circling the company like its new campus. Today, only a handful of apps types can integrate into Siri, As with the iPhone hardware, though, Apple can expect growing competition here as Google steps up efforts with Google Assistant and Samsung begins to roll out its own agent based on its acquisition of Viv technology designed by Siri's creators. Unveil a home voice agent approach. I once joked that Apple's answer to Alexa and Google Home could consist of little more than a cannister placed over an iPhone. Beyond the addition of far-field microphones and less reliance on a screen, more thought would surely go into such a product. With Amazon announcing that it sold nine times as many Echo units as it did last holiday, the business case for a voice-driven home agent is being proven out even as questions remain about their utility. Even Google, which processes billions of voice commands every day via Android phones, sees the value of capturing different kinds of requests and commands within the home; there must be some value there for Apple as pumps up Siri and other AI efforts. For privacy and security, change these iOS...

 What to expect from Apple in 2017 Steve Kovach Dec. 31, 2016, 8:00 AM 20,744 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook.AP 2016 was a bit of an off year for Apple. iPhone sales were down for the first time in the product's history. The iPhone 7 turned out to be a great phone, but Apple upset a lot of people by removing the headphone jack. The AirPods were delayed two months, meaning most people couldn't get them in time for the holidays. (You'll have to wait until February 2017 for them to arrive if you order them now.) And Consumer Reports torched the new MacBook Pro for its inconsistent battery life. So what does 2017 look like for Apple? Here's what I predict will dominate the conversation around Apple's products next year. It's not an all-inclusive list, but it's the stuff you'll likely care the most about. New iPads AP It feels like an eternity since Apple had anything to say about the iPad. We got the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro this past spring, but every other iPad model is one to three years old at this point.  The lineup is well overdue for a refresh, and it sounds like that may be coming soon. Rumors are all over the place, but it sounds like Apple is planning to release some new iPad models in the spring of 2017. Some reports say the new iPads will have slightly larger screens (10 inches, up from 9.7 inches), and that the non-Pro models will work with the Apple Pencil. Unfortunately, the early reports about the new crop of iPads are so consistent that it's tough to lock down exactly what Apple will end up launching. But it is pretty clear Apple's 2017 will start with the iPad. A greater emphasis on Siri Apple/YouTube Two of Apple's biggest rivals doubled down on voice assistants this year, leaving Siri in the dust. Google launched its excellent new Assistant on the Pixel phone and Google Home speaker. Assistant can tap into Google's vast library of internet knowledge to bring you the answers you want. Amazon continued to define the voice assistant category by expanding Alexa to new Echo devices like the Dot and Amazon Tap. Plus, third parties started integrating Alexa into their gadgets. (Expect to see so much more of that in 2017, by the way.) Despite its five-year head start on the competition, Siri still feels woefully behind. Apple added limited third-party support for Siri, but there are few signs it's really taking off.  What could we see from Siri in 2017? The good news for Apple is it's sitting on a lot of excellent AI and voice control technology, especially thanks to its purchase of a UK-based startup called VocalIQ. I wrote about VocalIQ way back in May. The technology would allow users to control all their Apple gadgets with just their voice, which will be useful in the home, car, and while using the AirPods. Here's what I reported at the time: Because VocalIQ understands context so well, it essentially eliminates the need to look at a screen for confirmation that it’s doing what you want it to do. That’s useful on the phone, but could be even better for other ambitious projects like the car or smart-speaker system Apple is reportedly building. (VocalIQ was being pitched as a voice-controlled AI platform for cars before Apple bought the company.) In fact, VocalIQ only considers itself a success when the user is able to complete a task without looking at a screen. Siri, Google Now, and Cortana often ask you to confirm tasks by tapping on the screen. 2017 would be a great time for Apple to start incorporating VocalIQ's technology into Siri, considering how far ahead the competition is today. Another dull year for the Mac Hollis Johnson/Business Insider The only thing of note to happen with the Mac this year was the launch of the new MacBook Pro. And even that was met with a lot of anger. Many were upset that they had to purchase a lot of adapters to get their accessories to work with the new Thunderbolt 3 port. And then everyone learned the MacBook Pro's battery life was nowhere near as good as Apple claimed. Bummer. It doesn't look like much more is in store for the Mac in 2017. The iMac could get a spec bump and the battery life on the MacBook Pro could (and should!) get fixed, but don't expect much else. Modest improvements to the Apple Watch Hollis Johnson Apple learned a major lesson with the Apple Watch, and has since scaled back expectations for the device and focused on health and fitness instead with the new Apple Watch Series 2. It's unlikely the Apple Watch will get a significant update in 2017, but I wouldn't be surprised if a new model showed up with 4G connectivity so you could use it without your iPhone. A major iPhone refresh A salesman checks a customer's iPhone at a mobile phone store in New Delhi, India, July 27, 2016.REUTERS/Adnan Abidi 2017 will mark the iPhone's tenth anniversary, and it sounds like Apple is gearing up for a blowout. The next iPhone is said to be a major refresh with an all-glass design, no bezels around the screen, and possibly a version with a curved display. Not to mention wireless charging, the death of the home button, and a new screen technology called OLED, which provides deeper, richer colors. By now there are so many reputable reports backing up these claims that it's silly not to believe them. The iPhone is Apple's most important and profitable product. If it feels like the company has shifted focus from other categories to focus on the iPhone, it's easy to see why. It's the product you're going to care the most about and spend the most money on. Expect to start seeing the first design leaks early in 2017. Rebound? After a year full of various stumbles, Apple is exiting 2016 on shakier ground than it started. Besides the next iPhone, there doesn't seem to be too much coming in the pipeline to get super excited about. The big challenge for Apple in 2017 will be to unlock more potential from its products by continuing to improve where it's always been the weakest: AI, software, and other digital services.

On most models, you can choose whether you want to be notified about calls, texts and calendar events. On the Blaze, shown here, you can also link your email account, as well as some messaging programs such as WhatsApp. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     Wearable devices such as smartwatches and fitness trackers were a popular gift this holiday season. But, once you open up the box, it can be hard to know what to look for outside of the basic setup. That's why we're here to help. For these tips, we're focusing on instructions for the Apple Watch and for Fitbit devices -- the two most popular wearables makers in the United States -- although the suggestions fit most types of wearables. Here are three things to think about as you set up your shiny new wearable device. • Pick a side. I realize this sounds pretty basic, but choosing a wrist can be important for fitness trackers such as Fitbit because your dominant hand tends to move a lot more throughout the day than your non-dominant hand. That, in turn, can affect the way trackers actually log your movement. On Fitbit, for example, you can tell it if you're wearing the device on your more active hand or not in the app that links with your new tracker. On the Apple Watch, during setup you can tell it which wrist you want to wear it on (right or left) and which side you want the digital crown -- Apple's little controller wheel -- to face. That should take care of everyone's preferences for watch orientation. If you want to change this for any reason, you can do so through the Watch app on your phone -- just hit "My Watch" and then go to "General" settings. "Watch Orientation" should be an option for you. • To share or not to share? Many of the features in smartwatches and other wearables have a lot of sharing functions -- so you can share your fitness progress throughout the day, or compete with friends. For some people, this is part of the point of getting a wearable. But, for others, it may be a tracking step too far. So, it's time to get cozy with your privacy settings. For Fitbit users, you can find your privacy settings by heading to your web-based dashboard, and diving into the settings menu. From there, you can control who can see your daily step counts, photos, location and other things that Fitbit tracks. By default, some things -- sleep patterns, your age, your weight, photos -- can only be viewed by you, but some things are also viewable by everyone, such as your average daily step count. Adjust as you see fit. On the Apple Watch, you can also share your activity for the day, but that is not set up by default. Where privacy can get tricky with the Apple Watch is in displaying notifications on your wrist. If you don't want anyone who glances at your wrist to be able to read the start of your text messages, there is a setting that will let you limit what is shown on the watch face. Head to the Watch app on your phone and hit the "Notifications" menu. If you switch on "Notifications Privacy," you'll have to tap to see messages and other notification details. It can be a little less convenient, but it could also save you some embarrassment in a meeting. • Mind your notifications. One thing that can quickly kill the joy of a wearable device is getting too many notifications. It's great to see who's calling or texting, but it can be pretty annoying to be expecting a message and then get a tap on the wrist to let you know that an article about a celebrity you don't know is trending on Twitter. For the Apple Watch, you can set the watch to mirror all your phone's notifications, but that can become overwhelming quickly. A better approach is to head into the Watch app and find your "Notifications" section. Scroll down through all the apps to choose what you want to see on your wrist and what you don't. Keep in mind that you may have to head back here as you install new apps, to set those notifications as you like them as well. On Fitbit devices, notifications vary by the type of device you own, but can be controlled through the Fitbit app by heading to the "Account" section and then tapping on "Notifications." On most models, you can choose whether you want to be notified about calls, texts and calendar events. On the Blaze, one of Fitbit's more advanced models, you can also link your email account, as well as some messaging programs such as WhatsApp. For all models, keep in mind that to receive notifications on your wrist, you will also have to turn them on for your phone.

Hints of fruit, honey and white flowers make an appearance, so it's a top option to toast with on New Year’s Eve.  Jenn Rice Fullscreen Torn between beer and bubbly to ring in the new year? Stella Artois Cidre is a well-balanced, crispy and great option. Enjoy it straight out of the bottle or sip it like Champagne out of a proper wine glass.  Jenn Rice Fullscreen At Egg Shop in New York City, executive chef Nick Korbee is constantly looking for bubbly options to pair with brunch and dinner. His current favorite? Sustainably made Da Mar Prosecco. “Eggs and bubbly always make for a fantastic pairing, but you don’t always have to splurge on Champagne,” he says. “The effervescence and acid on the Da Mar complement our savory, flavorful egg dishes perfectly, and the bottle won’t break the bank.”  Egg Shop Fullscreen Cult cider producer Andy Brennan, of Aaron Burr Cidery in Wurstboro, N.Y., is making cider using the Champagne method -- and yes, you guessed it, the cider actually drinks like a fine glass of bubbly. While it’s hard to get ahold of due to popular demand, stop by The North Branch Inn’s bar in the Catskills for a taste of Callicoon Creeks cider (or whatever version they have on hand at the time).  Jenn Rice Fullscreen Just in time for the holidays, SIMI Winery released its first two sparkling wines since 1940. SIMI 1876 Brut features a crisp, refreshing flavor profile of apple, citrus and almond pastry -- making it a great bubbly option to pair alongside soft cheese spreads and oysters.  Jenn Rice Fullscreen For rosé fanatics, SIMI’s 1876 Brut Rosé entices the taste buds with sweet and savory notes of pie crust, candied cherry, apple and fig.  Jenn Rice Fullscreen Crafted with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Blanc grapes, Le Marchesine Franciacorta Rosè Brut Millesimato is an Italian sparkling option you’ll want to stock up on year-round. It’s the perfect rosy hue that’s not too dry and not too sweet and gives off subtle aromas of flowers and raspberries.  Jenn Rice Fullscreen The White Knight Prosecco D.O.C. is a “fresh and flirty” option that will definitely please the palate. With delicate aromas of melon, pear, white peach and green apple, what’s not to like?  Jenn Rice Fullscreen Another amazing option discovered via Wines of Chile is Valdivieso Brut Rosé. As one of Chile’s most prized and celebrated wineries, this crisp, dry and slightly sweet rosé is a bottle everyone will enjoy.  Jenn Rice Fullscreen Crafted from Chardonnay, Glera and Malbec grape varieties, Santa Margherita Sparkling Rose is a rosy pink crowd pleaser. Its nose of white fruits and berries makes it a sparkling option that you can drink (responsibly) all night long.  Santa Margherita Fullscreen Brotherhood Winery in Washingtonville, N.Y., touted as "America's oldest winery," offers a delicious Blanc de Blancs Sparkling Wine that will please any Chardonnay aficionado, as it's crafted from 100% New York Chardonnay.  Brotherhood Winery Fullscreen If you’re looking for a non-wine option, look no further than Awestruck Lavender Hops -- a unique hard cider crafted in Sidney, N.Y. It’s the perfect marriage of citrus and floral and is a fun, purple-hued, fizzy beverage that beer and wine drinkers will appreciate.  Awestruck Fullscreen Hillersden’s Sparkling Sauvignon Blanc caters to both Sauvignon Blanc and Champagne drinkers thanks to its bubbly, crisp and refreshing profile. The winery makes the first single vineyard wine in Marlborough Valley, New Zealand.  Hillersden Fullscreen In Brooklyn, Smith & Vine can’t keep Lini 910 Labrusca Lambrusco Rosé in stock. The medium bodied, fruit-forward Italian sparkling wine pairs well with everything from cheese and charcuterie to bruschetta.  Smith & Vine Fullscreen One of Mumm Napa’s most sought after wines, Cuvée M Red is a sparkling blend made from Pinot Noir and Syrah that will entice the crowds. Its complex bouquet features cassis, elderberries, red plums, cardamom and tobacco.  Mumm Napa Fullscreen Like this topic?

Here are the rumored iPhone and iPad features iOS 10.3 beta already? Here are the rumored iPhone and iPad features By Matt Swider Mobile phones   iOS 10.3 leak points to mysterious 'Theatre mode' Shares Apple is readying the iOS 10.3 beta update for January, according to a new leak that allegedly spills the beans on the new iPhone and iPad features. The big highlight to Apple's next major software update is dubbed 'Theatre mode,' according to notable leaker Sonny Dickson on Twitter. While Dickson doesn't go into much detail about the new mode, he does reveal that it includes a new popcorn-shaped Control Center icon. That leads us to believe it's either a 'dark mode' for optimal video viewing (Apple did just launch a bright white TV app), or a new way to silence your phone when taking it into the movies. The iOS 10.3 launch timing checks out The iOS 10.3 beta release date, said to be January 10, comes on the heels of this month's final iOS 10.2 software launch. But the timing isn't surprising for anyone keeping track. Last year, the iOS 9.3 beta arrived in January, too, and it debuted the popular Night Shift mode in successive beta updates. We could be (and hopefully are) in for another mid-cycle game changer with 'Theater Mode,' should it be just as valuable as Night Shift in the end. Even more exciting is the prospect that the final iOS 10.3 update could be timed to launch with a new iPad in March or April, just like the final iOS 9.3 update did with the iPad Pro 9.7.  Anyone up for an iPad Pro 2 running iOS 10.3?

Texas does not have any law preventing motorists from using their smartphones while driving in its highways.  ( Mario Tama | Getty Images ) Advertisement Apple has just been slapped with a lawsuit that alleges its FaceTime application caused a fatal crash that happened in Texas last 2014. The case, which has been filed before the Santa Clara County Superior Court in California last Dec. 23, cited that the company has failed to implement a critical feature that it already has patented. Complaint Based On Apple Patent James and Bethany Modisette, the complainants, allege that such a feature could have prevented the accident from taking place. The incident claimed the life of their daughter and caused serious injuries to several members of the family. The identified technology involves the patent that Apple submitted in December 2008, which has the capability to lock FaceTime when its user is driving a motor vehicle. It was approved in April 2014, eight months before the accident. Texas Car Crash The Modisettes' case arises from the incident that transpired on Christmas Eve of 2014. The couple and their two children, Isabella and Moriah, were on board a vehicle traversing the Interstate I-35 in the outskirts of Dallas. Another car slammed into it and critically injured James and Moriah. Both were rushed to a nearby hospital, but the young girl eventually died due to her injuries. She was only 5 years old when the incident happened. FaceTime And Apple's Purported Liability According to the driver of the motor vehicle that collided with the Modisettes, he was distracted by FaceTime, which was still open on his iPhone 6 Plus when first responders arrived at the scene. "Defendant Apple Inc. has had the technology to prevent these events, and the Modisettes' injuries, specifically since at least Dec. 12, 2008, when it filed an application with the U.S. Patent Office for a 'driver handheld computing device lock-out," the complaint against Apple stated. The complainants further claimed that Apple's responsibility rests on its failure to manufacture and sell the iPhone 6 Plus with the safety feature that is already available to it. It also pointed out that the company was not able to warn its consumers about the danger posed by its devices and applications when used or misused. Defective Product For these reasons, the Modisette family accuses Apple of letting a device it considers to be defective roll out of its facilities. The complainants further stressed that the action and the liability of the driver who caused the crash is inextricably intertwined with Apple and its culpability. The Modisettes also noted how Apple already has the technology for years and the patent granted to it that guarantees the company can exploit the feature without competition for 20 years. Apple is yet to issue an official statement about the case. The company, however, has already encountered disputes concerning another FaceTime patent, as well as its other technologies in the past. The company is also constantly refining the application due to emergent threats and vulnerabilities. TAG Apple, FaceTime, iPhone 6 Plus, U.S. Patent Office © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

By Emily Bary Dec. 30, 2016 2:07 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large A report on Friday suggested that Apple was cutting 10% of its iPhone 7 production, based on calculations from suppliers. Illustration: Getty Images Apple CEO Tim Cook called the company’s AirPods earphones “a runaway success” this week and noted that the Apple can’t make them fast enough to keep up with demand. That doesn’t appear to be the case with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The company is reportedly cutting iPhone production by approximately 10%, according to the Nikkei Asian Review. That’s based on calculations from suppliers. Apple ended up trimming production around this time last year, too, the Nikkei Review says. That’s because of an inventory pile-up after the iPhone 6 and 6s didn’t sell as well as planned. The article notes that the smartphone company tried to learn from those mistakes by cutting production of the 7 and 7 Plus by 20% at the outset, but the phones still haven’t been flying off shelves. That could be because the new phones don’t have many features that you couldn’t also find on prior models, so people aren’t inclined to upgrade. And while the 7 Plus has a fancy new camera, the Nikkei Review mentions that Apple is having trouble getting enough camera sensors for its bigger iPhone model. These are some worrisome trends, but Apple doesn’t need to rely on new phone sales as much as it did in the past. The company’s “services” business, made up of things like the App Store and iCloud Storage, is growing quickly. As long as people are still buying music and movies from the iTunes Store and Apple Music, it might not matter too much what kind of phone they use. Meanwhile, the entire production issue could be moot given that 2017, when Apple celebrates the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, has a major launch in store -- the iPhone 8. Apple shares were down 0.8% in Friday trading, to $115.78. For 2016, the stock has returned 12.5%, including dividends, exactly on par with the S&P 500. Big Picture: Apple appears to be cutting production of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. That implies that the phones haven’t been selling as well as the company had predicted.

Five important technological breakthroughs in 2016 Tech giants' new success mantra: Develop in India for the world Inter-state council a forum to address people's concerns: Modi The year 2016 has been a packed year when it comes to technology, with some of the biggest trends emerging out of India. From a $20 billion investment on setting up a 4G network to Aadhaar now becoming part of the “billion club” that only companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft have been members of. Here are the top 10 technology trends for the year gone by: A Billion Aadhaar In April this year the number of people registered by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) crossed one billion, marking a significant milestone for the country’s digital identity programme. The Aadhaar programme became the first government-funded programme in the world to ever have over a billion users. The only comparisons one can draw are to global technology companies such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft which have over a billion users for their products. The service is today powering schemes such as the Direct Benefit Transfer and going forward, will be used to power the India Stack, a group of digital services that will enable payments, authentication, storage of important documents, enable easier disbursal of loans and even make it easier for the common man to invest in capital markets. Year of Make in India for phones While Make in India has been one of the most popular agendas of the Modi government, the scheme really came into its own in 2016. India saw 35 new smartphone factories being setup with capacity for local production jumping fivefold over the previous year. The growth in manufacturing phones in India has given employment to an additional 37,000 people, with the aim of growing the sectors employment to 50 lakh people by 2020 when production hits 500 million devices. While today the smartphone manufacturing sector in India largely just assembles phones, in the upcoming years there are plans to being component manufacturing here as well which. This will not only require additional skills as a country but also better infrastructure, but will be worthwhile considering the bulk of smartphone demand in the future will be driven by Indian consumers. Google becomes a hardware maker So far Google has been known for making some of the slickest software in the world, with over seven of its products having over a billion users. While the company has dabbled with the idea of making its own hardware for a few years now, nothing really said “Google has arrived” in hardware as much as its Pixel phones. Launched in October this year, the Pixel smartphones from Google is what the company imagines the best hardware to run its Android software and apps is. While the Nexus devices were sort of that, Google now has full control over its own premium hardware. The Pixel phones are directly pitted against the Apple iPhone, with many calling it the iPhones biggest competitor in the years to come. In India, analysts estimate that the Pixel has captured 10 per cent of the premium smartphone market (Rs 35,000 and above) in the country. Reusable rockets Elon Musk’s space venture SpaceX, achieved one of its greatest feats in the quest for affordable space travel in 2016 -- it landed a rocket used to propel a satellite into space back to earth safely. With it the era of reusable space vehicles was back, after NASA decommissioned the space shuttle. By reusing its Falcon 9 rocket (and other future rockets) SpaceX hopes to lower the cost of launching satellites or other items into space by as much as 30 per cent. This along with the already dwindling cost of launching items into space could really make “affordable” space travel a reality. Luxembourg-based satellite manufacturer SES has already signed a contract with SpaceX to launch using one of the company’s reused Falcon 9 rockets. At this stage everything is still an experiment, but with Musk’s push for commercialising test flights, the speed of development is extremely fast. Reliance Jio Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio has been heralded as one of the most revolutionary changes in India’s telecom sector, which will have a larger impact of putting the Digital India dream on the map. According to statistics, Jio users are consuming 40-50 times more data than the average 3G smartphone user, with the service adding 10 million new users every month. While growth is expected to level off in the months to come when the promotions run out, the fact that a large number of first-time users or low end users would have experienced the boon of high-speed net connectivity is enough to push them to pay more for 4G connectivity in the future, or at least that’s the idea. None of this came cheap though. Mukesh Ambani calls Jio the world’s biggest startup that spent between $17-20 billion on infrastructure and other things before even getting its first customer. With a base plan that’s equal to the average monthly Indian spend on mobile talktime and recharge (Rs 150) and higher plans of Rs 499 and Rs 999, it is to be seen how quickly Jio makes back its investment. Year of self-driving Every major car manufacturer and even technology companies such as Google, Apple and Uber are now very much in the race to build self-driving cars. The year 2016 was a milestone for self-driving cars not only because a lot of them finally got permission to begin testing on public roads, but also because the stance of some players such as Google and Uber became clear that they would sell self-driving as a service rather than build cars. While self-driving cars might have grabbed most of the headlines, it’s clear that the first form of autonomous vehicles on roads will be trucks. Otto, a subsidiary of Uber that builds self-driving trucks, made a 120 mile (193 km) run carrying 50,000 beers for Budweiser almost completely autonomously. Self-driving cars are still a way away, but more of the features are slowly trickling into cars, albeit high end ones, already. Tesla’s cars can now drive themselves on the highway, and while the company faced a setback when investigators began looking for malfunctions in its system that could have caused a fatal crash, just this month a video of a Model S swerving to avoid a collision before the crash had even occurred ahead of the vehicle began doing the rounds. Uber out of China On August 1, Uber traded its China business for a 20 per cent stake in rival Didi Chuxing, thus bringing an end to the pipe dream that western firms could successfully do business in China. Muscled out of China with rules favouring local competitors, Travis Kalanick fully turned his attention to winning India. While India was always a large blip on Uber’s radar, thanks to its underdeveloped and shoddy public transport systems and high-fare cabs. With big investments freeing up from China ($200 million a month) a big chunk of that has been diverted to winning in India, apart from an already substantial portion of a $3.5 billion fund raise being allotted to Uber India. Uber’s heavy handed tactics of buying itself into the first place has been objected by current Indian market leader Ola. The Indian firm has accused Uber of “capital dumping” - a term it explained as foreign companies using capital raised or earned abroad to create an uneven playing field in India. Ola, one of the most well-funded companies in Indian used its capital muscle to squeeze all its local rivals, and even bought and shut down its closest rival TaxiForSure. Drone deliveries Drones became a staple of technology terminology in 2015, with everyone from cinematographers to the average joe buying into the “drone culture”. The year 2016 was when some serious applications for drones in the civilian space began to emerge. Among the coolest uses for drones came from e-commerce giants such as Amazon that began testing drones for delivering items to a customer's doorstep. The company made its first commercial drone delivery in the UK, when it delivered popcorn and a Fire TV streaming device to a customer outside Oxford. In India, Amazon’s biggest competitor Flipkart too is dabbling with the idea of delivering products to customers using drones. The company told Business Standard it was working with a few universities that were developing drone technology to really explore their use in e-commerce logistics. Google WiFi at Indian train stations Google began rolling out its free Wi-Fi at Indian train stations in January, and by December had achieved a goal of connecting 100 stations. Going forward, the company plans to connect a total of 400 stations and reach 10 million people a day with its free Wi-Fi. For 2017, it is expected that Google will stick to the same pace, growing its base by a further 100 stations through the year. For the project that’s trying to promote people who’ve never used the Internet to buy into a data pack, that should be a commendable goal. ISRO goes private India’s space agency is looking more deeply at partnering with the private sector as it looks to speed up growth to tap into the massive growth seen in the global space market. While already tapping into private companies to build components for satellites and rockets, it has decided to grow that in the coming years. Not only did ISRO sign over the complete development of two satellites to a private consortium, it also has begun working on plans to setup a separate entity along with private players to build and launch its PSLV rockets for other private players and countries. ISRO is looking at a timeline of 2020 to setup the consortium of private partners, but has begun working on the framework for rules of engagement. The idea is to retain all strategic and social function launches thorough ISRO while commercial launches could be diverted to the private consortium giving the space agency more bandwidth to work on cutting edge research.

The family claims that Apple had the patent for a safer version of its "FaceTime" video calling app, but chose to make the less safe version available with the iPhone 6 -- ultimately leading to a car crash that resulted in the death of their five-year-old daughter Moriah Modisette, Courthouse News reported this week. The case dates back to 2014 when Moriah was travelling in the back of her parents' car near Dallas and was hit by another car driven by Garrett Willhelm who was using the Apple "FaceTime" while driving. The erring driver had confessed to the police that he was on "FaceTime" and police had also found that the app was still live when they arrived at the scene. Given the fact that the app fully engages visual components, the Modisette family blamed Apple for its failure to either programme a shutoff into the "FaceTime" or give strong warning about using the app while driving. "Defendant Apple Inc. has had the technology to prevent these events, and the Modisettes' injuries, specifically since at least December 12, 2008, when it filed an application with the US Patent Office for a 'driver handheld computing device lock-out," the family said in the complaint. The failure of Apple to use GPS tracking to detect the speed of the vehicle in which a user was travelling and shut down the "FaceTime" app was a significant factor in the accident, the family added. The grieving family has sought economic damages along with punitive damages. --IANS qd/gb/bg (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Details here! Samsung OLED Display 2017 is Rumored for Apple iPhone 8 A report suggests that Apple outsources its iPhone's OLED panels to Samsung. While this isn't news anymore, but MacRumors has updated the information after investigating several sources regarding the partnership. As a reminder, the previous rumor on iPhone 8 hints Apple unveiling three variants, 4.7 inches, 5.5 inches and 5.8 inches and as per AppleInsider report, the largest iPhone 8 will be the only one rocking Samsung's AMOLED display.

Apple has also reportedly been testing out several iPhone prototypes and one of them is the alleged curved-display iPhone 8 Apple iPhone 8 Foldable Screen Reports There have been reports stating that iPhone 8 will feature a foldable display.

Gadget Which phone has a better camera? iPhone 7 Plus vs Google Pixel XL: Check Out The Google Pixel is the first Android phone to use Google Assistant. But Siri continues to get better too. Google Assistant was better at answering questions about differences between competing technologies (e.g., OLED vs. LCD). By Rishabh Rajvanshi - Jan 1, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Few months have passed since the legendary phones of 2016, Apple iPhone 7 and Google Pixel XL, were launched in by the two tech giants. And several reviewers and tech geeks have shared their opinions on the Internet suggesting the which one is better option to choose. But still those who want to purchase a flagship smartphone are getting confused between the two as both of the companies have given their best efforts to make a unmatchable handset. So we have decided to offer a comparison between the camera performance of the two smartphones. Have a look: Google Pixel XL The Google Pixel XL smartphone is creating so much hype in the smartphone market, the smartphone is claimed by the company to boast best smartphone camera ever. Also, the reviewers are comparing its camera pairs with the professional DSLR camera. In addition, some people using the handset are fans of its performance. So clearing out readers that it is not a myth anymore that the smartphone comes with the best camera ever. Camera Specs With f/2.0 aperture and 1.55um pixels drawing in maximum light, the point and click experience seems promising. With a 12.3 megapixel rear and 8-megapixel front camera, all you budding photographers can click your best. Also, DXOMark gives the rear camera 89 points, the highest points ever for any smartphone. App Update The company really has been putting its efforts to offer best photography experience to its users. And for the same, Google has recently launched an update, after acknowledging the lens flare issues in its recently launched Pixel phones, Google is whispered to bring a software update for bug fixing in the mid-November. Bug Fixes After receiving so many complaints about the malfunction in the camera app, Google is gearing up to fix the issues with the minor update, which is expected to dispatch by the end of November. The lens flare issues are found in most of the Pixel devices, causing the drop in image quality when piercing directly at an intense light source. Google, soon after launching the Pixel smartphones on October 13, started receiving complaints from a number of users about the ‘Arc Flare’ aka ‘Halo effect’ on images clicking from the Pixel phones. Isaac, the admin of Google Pixel device in a blog said, “Users are going to have a refreshed software update in the next couple of weeks which is completely intended to will fix the camera lens issues of Pixel smartphones. Currently, the technical team of Google is working on some algorithms which will identify the Halo or ARC flare effects in the camera portion of the Pixel Phones. However, he mentioned that the users need to have HDR+ to grab the benefits of this new software update.” iPhone 7 Plus The recently launched Apple iPhone 7 Plus is touted as the best image snapping camera phone till date. The 12 MP wide-angle lens and 12 MP telephoto lens of the iPhone 7 Plus shooter enables the users to click DSLR-like photographs and videos. In addition, the image and video hosting website, Flickr reported that iPhone models occupy top 10 positions in the list of best camera phones, including iPhone 6, 5s, 6s, and rest. Following are the photography points that makes the iPhone 7 a good camera phone: Shoot with the Perfect Light To get the perfect light for a shot, the manufacturer suggests to tap and hold anywhere on the display of the phone in order to lock AE/AF and then gently slide up or down and play with the exposure depending on the situation of the user. Better Zoom If a user wants to take a better digital zoom of almost 10x, the iPhoneallows them to use the optical zoom with dual 12 MP camera and it will give the excellent shot even if the object, which is required to be captured, is far away from the user. Use 4K Video Using 4K video is extremely prescribed to shot the videos with improved optical image stabilisation and built-in f/1.8 aperture setting. This will not only enhance the video quality but also make it crisp, colourful and look brighter. Time-lapse Video The iPhone 7 also allows users to make much smoother time-lapse videos than ever before. Users are enabled with the device to shoot time-lapse videos and get a closer view of the object’s actions. Capture Photo Most of the times it happens that we would want to click a photo of a particular action along with recording it. Here’s the solution! The users are also allowed to snap an image while recording video through an iPhone 7 by just tapping on the white icon, next to the red record button. Landscape Mode is the Best – To get the best video recorded, capturing it in the landscape mode is highly recommended. Capture HD Video Everyone wants to capture HD photos and videos today. With the latest iPhone, users can now shoot HD quality videos by just adjusting the camera settings, enabling the Record Video at 60 FPS option, which will allow them to record videos to 1080p HD video. Focus the Photo If you need the focus of the photo to be at one point of the frame, the iPhone 7 also enables the users to simply lock the auto focus or auto exposure at the point of focus. Verdict Debates trending on Twitter like “Google shouldn’t try to be Apple” is a fallacy. Rather than suppressing its capabilities, Google played to its strengths. What do you want in a phone, solely depends on you and it influences your expectations and demands. The features available in Pixel, if are what you have been searching for, your prayers just got answered. Yes, the Google Pixel is a lot of money, but it is the real deal. It is a flagship product which commands flagship price. Fair enough. Apple and Samsung just got a run for their money. With the Pixel, Google keeps things nice and easy.

Stock Market Today Stocks End Down, But Up For 2016; Apple, Microsoft Drag On Dow, Nasdaq The stock market fell Friday but ended the year with decent gains. Will the Dow hit 20,000 in the new year? (Richard B. Levine/Newscom) NANCY GONDO 12/30/2016 Reprints The stock market wrapped up 2016 with a whimper Friday, as the key indexes posted moderate losses. But for the year, they ended with decent gains after a post-election rally. The Nasdaq fell 0.9%, the S&P 500 0.5% and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.3%. Volume was slightly higher on both the NYSE and Nasdaq, according to preliminary data, likely due to "window dressing" by fund managers as they adjust their portfolios. The Dow, up 13% for the year, closed well below 19,800 after recently flirting with the 20,000 level. The S&P 500 notched a 9.5% gain, while the Nasdaq advanced 7.5%. Gold miners, telecom and chip stocks led the downside in the stock market today. Banks, property REITs and insurance stocks were among the few industry groups that posted small gains. Tech stocks, among the biggest losers on the Dow, took a hit. Microsoft (MSFT), Intel (INTC), Apple (AAPL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) all shed about 1% each. Three of the four big-cap techs outperformed the Nasdaq for the year, but fell short of the Dow. Microsoft rose 12%, Cisco 11%, Apple 10% and Intel 5%. Microsoft remains just out of the 5% buy zone from a 58.80 flat-base buy point. Cisco is trying to hold support at its 50-day moving average as it works on a flat base; Intel has shaped a cup with handle with a 37.44 buy entry. Apple may form a handle as it continues to build the right side of a cup base. The buy point for now stands at 118.79. Though shares are still 14% below their May 2015 peak, they made an impressive run in the back half of 2016, rising 33% from a May 2016 low to an early October high. Apple dipped 0.8% in below-average volume Friday amid a Nikkei Asia Review report it's cutting back on iPhone production due to weak demand. In other news, Apple reportedly plans to start making iPhones for the Indian market at a Bangalore factory in April. In the IBD 50, graphics chip designer Nvidia (NVDA) suffered the biggest loss, down more than 4% in heavy trade. Friday's action serves up the second big-volume drop in three sessions, a bearish sign. The stock plunged 7% Wednesday after reversing from a new intraday high. While it's due for a slowdown after a torrid 227% YTD gain, the heavy-volume reversals are alarming. SVB Financial (SIVB) was the biggest IBD 50 gainer for the day, picking up nearly 0.8% in tepid trade. The holding company for Silicon Valley Bank is far extended from a 112.93 buy point first cleared in October. Other financials with small gains included Citizens Financial Group (CFG), Goldman Sachs (GS) and East West Bancorp (EWBC).

(Image: Reuters) A family in the US who lost their young daughter in a car crash recently filed a lawsuit against Apple for allegedly encouraging distracted driving through "FaceTime" video calling app, media reported. The family claims that Apple had the patent for a safer version of its "FaceTime" video calling app, but chose to make the less safe version available with the iPhone 6 -- ultimately leading to a car crash that resulted in the death of their five-year-old daughter Moriah Modisette, Courthouse News reported this week.

The erring driver had confessed to the police that he was on "FaceTime" and police had also found that the app was still live when they arrived at the scene.

The failure of Apple to use GPS tracking to detect the speed of the vehicle in which a user was travelling and shut down the "FaceTime" app was a significant factor in the accident, the family added. The grieving family has sought economic damages along with punitive damages.

Like this story, share it with millions of investors on M3 Apple to make iPhones in Bengaluru Local manufacturing is expected to help Apple price its phones more competitively in India as it currently attracts 12.5 percent additional duty on imports. Post Your Comments Share Cancel | 1 Comments Apple is all set to start manufacturing its iconic iPhones in India at Bengaluru, as part of efforts to cash in on the world's second largest smartphone market in a big way. Local manufacturing is expected to help Apple price its phones more competitively in India as it currently attracts 12.5 percent additional duty on imports. The phones would be manufactured by Wistron, a Taiwanese OEM maker for Apple, according to top government sources. "Wistron has plans for setting up iPhone manufacturing plant for domestic market in Peenya," top government sources familiar with the developments told PTI. Another senior government official said Bengaluru has the talent required for quality high technology products and that was the reason for selecting the city. The official added that Foxconn, which also manufactures iPhones for Apple, had come with similar plans to the city some time back. This would be Apple's second big project for Bengaluru. In May, Apple had announced setting up a design and development accelerator in the City to grow the iOS developer community. The announcement was made as part of the visit of Apple CEO Tim Cook to India. The Cupertino-based company has been in discussions with Indian government seeking incentives to set up a manufacturing unit in the country. A group of senior officials from ministries, including commerce and finance, will early next month deliberate on the incentives sought by Apple to set up a manufacturing unit in the country. Apple had asked for several tax and other incentives to enter India in the manufacturing sector. The company has been ramping up its efforts to expand its business in India, one of its fastest growing markets. Apple is also keen on setting up retail presence in India and has sought relaxation in local sourcing norms. Tags  Apple manufacturing iPhones Bengaluru smartphone market Tim Cook Buy, Hold, Sell ?

And what were the issues that kept us busiest? Sat 8:00 AM 13,466 Views 21 Comments Share5 Tweet Email 2016 WAS THE first year of TheJournal.ie‘s FactCheck – the Republic of Ireland’s first and only fully-dedicated fact-checking project. As we turn the corner into 2017, we’re going to take a minute to pause and reflect on what turned out to be a momentous 12 months for politics, journalism, and (as it happened) fact-checking, around the world. We’ll present a tally of verdicts for politicians, and look back on the issues that kept us busiest. Politicians and their verdicts Including our first article on 5 February, we’ve done a total of 89 fact checks, examining more than 160 separate factual claims, up to 16 December. By far our biggest source of inspiration has been you, the reader. Your suggestions by email, tweet and direct message on Twitter gave rise to 37% (33) of all our fact checks. The rest came from TV and radio debate, social media, and we even had one fact check request delivered from the floor of Dáil Éireann. Since we started right at the beginning of the general election campaign, we were able to examine the claims of individuals and organisations from many different areas of Irish public debate, but 71% of our fact-checks (63) had to do with politics, or involved politicians or political parties. A breakdown of verdicts for everyone would be cumbersome and in some cases not particularly meaningful (what would we learn from knowing someone has a 100% TRUE rating, based on just one claim?) Instead we’ve picked out the nine political figures who had the most claims fact-checked this year, with all of them having had at least three claims checked. Here’s how they performed: Source: For a full-size version of this chart, click here As you can see, a series of debates during the general election campaign meant that the four major party leaders at the time had the most claims checked. Sinn Féin’s Gerry Adams had the relatively impressive record of seven TRUE claims out of 14 in total, while former Labour leader Joan Burton had six FALSE claims out of 12. Enda Kenny had a more mixed record, with five claims either TRUE or Mostly TRUE, and four either FALSE or Mostly FALSE. Out of his 10 fact-checked claims, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin had four FALSE, four TRUE or Mostly TRUE, and two Half TRUE. Justin Barrett, leader of the newly formed National Party, attracted a FALSE verdict for every one of his four claims in one fact check in November. By contrast, Mary Lou McDonald, who featured in a TV3 Deputy Leaders’ debate, had three TRUE claims out of three. Climate Change minister Denis Naughten had an odd mix, with one verdict each of Mostly TRUE, Half TRUE and UNPROVEN. Meanwhile, Social Protection Minister Leo Varadkar had one TRUE claim, but one FALSE and one Mostly FALSE, as well. The Big Issues There were four major themes that recurred throughout the year – in the news, in readers’ requests to FactCheck, and therefore in our articles: Water, jobs, industrial action and abortion. Water  Video (http://www.youtube.com/watch=8aaY-CRuwHg&t=) Source: TheJournal.ie/YouTube Arguably the biggest claim of all on this front – and, indeed, the one voted by readers as the False Claim of the Year – was Fianna Fáil’s unflinching denial that their stance on water charges and Irish Water had been anything other than consistent and unmoving. In fact, the party adopted several policy combinations, laid out in detail in our September fact check. When it came to this issue, the claims really did come thick and fast all year. Right2Water activist Brendan Ogle overstated the case in June when he said “big business and agriculture” used 90% of water, but ordinary households paid for 78% of the cost. Then there was former Minister and Labour TD Pat Rabbitte’s often-repeated claim that RTE focused mainly on water protests, largely ignoring the need for water infrastructure improvement. A FactCheck audit of the RTE news and current affairs archive found that this claim simply did not stand up to factual scrutiny. Video (http://www.youtube.com/watch=EHLAq01MNV4&t=) Source: TheJournal.ie/YouTube And earlier this month, with the report of the Expert Commission appearing to move water services in Ireland back in the direction of general taxation, the AAA-PBP made a point of saying that 73% of people had declined to pay their charges, the last time they were asked, in April and May. After a careful analysis, FactCheck came to the conclusion that Paul Murphy and Kieran Allen were probably right, but given a surprising gap in Irish Water’s data, we couldn’t say for sure. Jobs, Apple, multinationals Back at the height of the general election campaign, with jobs numbers being frequently and enthusiastically invoked by the government, and challenged by the opposition, we checked out two major issues, the source of many queries from readers over the past 11 months: the effect of JobBridge and temporary, part-time contracts on artificially putting a gloss on the employment statistics. The reality? Yes, job activation schemes have had a meaningful impact on unemployment levels. Right before Election Day, the unemployment rate would have been 12.6% instead of 8.6%, if people on job activation schemes were counted as unemployed. But no, the schemes don’t really represent a significant factor in terms of employment, during what has been a year of undeniably strong jobs growth in Ireland, whatever way you look at it. And contrary to common perception, as our fact check just a week later showed, a great portion of the new jobs created in the past few years have been good quality, full-time, permanent positions. Video (http://www.youtube.com/watch=ujw-BJ2frwA&t=) Source: TheJournal.ie/YouTube The European Commission’s Apple tax ruling in August gave rise to all manner of statistics being put across the airwaves in Ireland, especially in an effort to convey the stakes at play for Ireland. During one memorable week, it appeared almost as if government ministers were attempting to outbid one another at an auction, as the “number of workers at foreign companies” increased with successive interviews. The dependence of the Irish economy on foreign direct investment is fairly well-established in the public consciousness, and the true scale of employment at multinationals is actually significant enough in its own right that it doesn’t appear to have warranted the kind of progressive exaggeration we saw in September. The company at the centre of the whole debacle had its say, of course. In his response to the Commission’s ruling, CEO Tim Cook claimed that Apple was “the largest taxpayer in Ireland”, a claim repeated by Michael Noonan on the Six One News. The problem was, only Revenue is supposed to know how much every company pays in taxes. And they’re not authorized to tell anyone else. So how could Tim Cook possible know whether Apple is the biggest taxpayer in the country? Who knows. The company didn’t respond to our request for evidence, and the Department of Finance told us confidentiality concerns meant they were barred from commenting. Although that didn’t prevent Michael Noonan from repeating Tim Cook’s claim in the first place. Strike talk There was an almost unprecedented level of debate about industrial action in Ireland in 2016, and naturally this translated into plenty of factual claims on every side of every dispute. Back in March, we corrected the exaggerations and simplifications (as well as the accurate statements) contained in a heavily-circulated meme about Luas drivers and junior doctors. It provoked a strong reaction among readers, becoming the most-read fact check of the entire year. And at the height of the Dublin Bus drivers’ strike in September, we turned our sights to the NBRU leaflet dropped on buses across the capital one morning. When it turned out their claims were almost entirely true, readers shared our fact check en masse, and it formed the basis of a segment on TV3’s Tonight With Vincent Browne (starts at 23 mins). Then there was the $64 million question – is it legal for gardaí to go on strike, the subject of an in-depth fact check in August. While the government’s deal with gardaí avoided the unprecedented spectacle of our police force out on strike, it also inspired other sectors of the public service to re-evaluate their own posiitions – including the nurses. As our fact check revealed, the nursing union boss Liam Doran ran the gamut from FALSE to Mostly TRUE, and everything in between, during an extraordinarily fact-filled 90 seconds on Claire Byrne Live, in November. Abortion and the 8th Amendment With a Citizen’s Assembly beginning in September, and bills to repeal the 8th Amendment going through the Dáil, intensive debate on this perennial and sensitive issue was inevitable in 2016. Most notably, the Pro Life Campaign’s Cora Sherlock was found to have her facts straight, more often than not, in a series of public disputes with: the Irish Times’ Fintan O’Toole (on Ireland’s maternal mortality rate); Labour Senator Ivana Back (on “late-term” abortion); and with AAA-PBP TD Ruth Coppinger (on the subject of Down Syndrome and abortion in the UK). However, Sherlock’s Prolife Campaign colleague Sinead Slattery found herself caught out on TV3’s Tonight With Alison O’Connor, after appearing to read a quote from HSE guidelines on maternal bereavement. The problem was, the HSE guidelines did not say what she claimed they did. Video (http://www.youtube.com/watch=CLYmt03Fqm8&t=) Source: TheJournal.ie/YouTube During the summer, Taoiseach Enda Kenny was accused of misleading the Dáil after badly misrepresenting the results of Ireland’s several past referendums on abortion. FactCheck asked Kenny’s office for evidence to support his claims, and later on, if he would be retracting his statements. We got no response. The major stories of 2016 With the seismic, shocking impact of Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, it was perhaps inevitable that FactCheck would rub up against some bold claims connecting Ireland to the year’s two biggest news stories. Government Chief Whip Regina Doherty misrepresented the facts in October, when she defended the cabinet’s preparations and contingencies for Brexit, by claiming that it would be “illegal” for them to negotiate with the UK before the Article 50 notification is triggered. It wouldn’t, as it turns out. And back in the summer, then candidate Donald Trump announced a plan to visit his business interests in Scotland and Ireland, prompting a petition to ban him from the country, which got us thinking – could he actually be barred from Ireland? It turns out he could, but it was always going to be unlikely. In the end, he cancelled his trip. After the publication of our fact check. (But let’s not rush to conclusions about cause and effect). And finally, a word about “fake news” and social media. Post-’post-truth’ Not that there’s any fear of us forgetting, but remember, 2016 was the year that the Oxford English Dictionary felt was best captured with the phrase “post-truth”. Interestingly, the Society for the German Language also deemed “postfaktisch” its word of the year. While Irish public debate has, mercifully, been spared the kind of blatant lying and redefinition of the meaning of language seen, for example, in the US this year, FactCheck did have one or two brushes with outrageous or viral falsehoods, this year. This included our first ever verdict of “Nonsense”, which was introduced in September, and went to an article on the Winning Democrats website, which claimed “Ireland is now officially accepting Trump refugees from America”. As an example of what’s generally (though without precise definition) referred to as “fake news”, it’s almost perfect. An ideologically-motivated piece on an ideologically-slanted website that appears to produce news (but doesn’t really) A headline that does not match the body of the article Is not supported with any specific evidence in the article And constitutes a baseless exaggeration of an existing story (the people of Inishturk inviting Americans to come and visit) Which is itself centred around an (at best) considerable misquotation from another source. And though the article was originally published in May, it went viral (all over again) in the 48 hours after Trump’s election. As a result, many internet users received the (entirely, ridiculously) false impression that, almost immediately after the result, Ireland had formally opened its doors to Americans seeking asylum because of a president who had not yet taken office. Speaking of fake news, and bearing in mind the year that was in it, in September TheJournal.ie‘s FactCheck took the step of signing up to the world’s first Code of Fact-checking Principles, as part of our involvement with the International Fact-checking Network.

The iPhone X concept is a device we would love to see from Apple in 2017, and it’s something that would absolutely smoke the competition. As often as we joke about Android phones looking the same, Apple hasn’t changed things up drastically from a design standpoint in ages. Sure, they make small design changes go a long way, but an edged panel would bring consumers to a frenzy. That’s what we’re getting from a new iPhone X Anniversary concept render from designer Imran Taylor, who produced the beautiful handset you see in the photos. Our favorite concept phones are ones that keep things in the realm of possibility.  The iPhone X does just that as it has a clean look with rounded edges and the classic home button. From the side you can see the glass extends around the edges, and while it’s minimal, it is striking nonetheless. The display would be 5.8-inches according to Taylor, and of the curved OLED variety with a touch-sensitive lower bezel. The new home button would be able to handle gesture support while the front and back would make use of Sapphire Glass. There’s also a smart connector on the back to go along with wireless charging and a rear Dual Camera setup. As for the build, Zirconia Ceramic was mentioned, which we had to look up. It’s strong and note prone to cracking which makes sense given the oversized display and the whole Bendgate issue. It’s also heat resistant and can deal with electrical waves like a boss. The new iPhone X or iPhone 8 concept render isn’t too flashy and has more than enough class to keep fans happy. It’s also different enough to draw in a whole slew of new consumers, especially ones looking to turn away from the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 next year. For now, we’ll have to dream but we will have our fingers crossed Apple goes edged in 2017.

The news comes after Yahoo-owned research firm Flurry earlier this week revealed that the holiday season was a big hit for Apple`s iPhone and between December 19 to 25, Apple`s iPhone and iPad accounted for 44 percent of all mobile activations -- much higher than Samsung. "This is not the first time Apple has cut back on iPhone production as a similar event occurred this year in the January - March quarter. That cut on production was around 30 percent," 9to5mac.com reported. Last year, Apple`s devices accounted for 49.1 percent of all activations during the same period while Samsung last year accounted for 19.8 percent of all activations. Apple is also reportedly planning to manufacture iPhones in Bengaluru in association with Wistron, a Taiwanese OEM manufacturer for Apple and will start production by April 2017.   First Published: Saturday, December 31, 2016 - 12:18 Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus MOST READ TOP NEWS MOST VIEWED State Bank of India cuts lending rate by 0.9% across maturities Home, auto loans cheapest in 6 years as SBI, PNB, ICICI cut lending rates by up to 0.9%, other banks follow Eating at restaurants, hotels to be cheaper; govt says service charge on bill not compulsory Petrol price hiked by Rs1.29 per litre, diesel Rs 0.97 per litre India's core infrastructure sector growth rises to 4.9% in November Big relief to housewives from IT department New Year gift: Home, auto loans set to be cheaper Luxury cars to be launched in 2017 Bikes to be launched in 2017 Service charge in restaurant is not compulsary Prices of petrol in 10 major cities Prices of diesel in 10 major cities RBI introduces facility for NRIs to exchange old Rs 500, Rs 1000 notes up to June 2017 BSE's India International Exchange​ to go live post 'Makar Sankranti' Related News iPhone production to be slashed by 10% in Q1 2017: Report   Check out top 5 best-selling holiday movies on iTunes Apple, Nokia lock horns over patents; sue each other again Apple iPhone 8 with OLED models likely to sport curved panels Apple adds wide range of fresh emojis to iPhone TAGS Apple Apple iPhone Apple iPhone cost Apple iPad iPhone production Gallery 10 Major Cars Launched in 2016 10 Most Expensive Hotels In India Top 10 countries in ease of doing business TOP VIDEOS New Year gift: Home, auto loans set to be cheaper Govt keeps interest rates of small saving schemes unchanged Service charge in restaurant is not compulsary contact Privacy Policy Legal Disclaimer complaint Our Team investor info WHERE TO WATCH Careers Partner Site: DNA INDIA news India States World Technology Science & Environment Health Photo entertainment Bollywood television Music Regional Movie Reviews Hollywood lifestyle People Relationships Travel Food & Recipes Fashion Culture Horoscope Spirituality sports Cricket Football World Motorsports Golf Others Softspot Debate Blogs Exclusive Pics Videos business Automobile Economy Markets Personal Finance Market Stats Companies Real Estate Bullion International Business Photo Gallery India City Mumbai Kolkata Pune Bengaluru Chennai Hyderabad Ahmedabad STATES Andhra Pradesh Assam Bihar Chhattisgarh Delhi NCR Goa Gujarat Haryana Himachal Pradesh Jammu and Kashmir Jharkhand Karnataka Kerala Madhya Pradesh Maharashtra North East Odisha Punjab Rajasthan Tamil Nadu Telangana Uttar Pradesh Uttarakhand UTs West Bengal World Asia Africa Americas Europe Australia-Oceania Technology Gadgets Mobiles Gaming Apps Internet & Social Media Science & Environment Space Environment Discoveries Science Hindi Home देश प्रदेश दुनिया खेल-खिलाड़ी कारोबार ज्ञान-विज्ञान मनोरंजन ज़ी स्पेशल सेहत तस्वीरें वीडियो भविष्यफल Marathi Home मुंबई महाराष्ट्र भारत विश्व स्पोर्ट्स बार कल्लाबाजी हेल्थ मंत्रा ब्लॉगर्स पार्क युथ क्लब Exclusive फोटो व्हिडिओ भविष्य Bengali Home Kolkata State Nation World Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Blogs Health Photos Videos Slideshows Weather Inverstors Home About ZMCL Listing Document Shareholding Pattern Presentations & Releases Board of Directors Financials-Annual Financials-Quarterly Q&A Transcripts Code of Conduct Notices © 1998-2016 Zee Media Corporation Ltd (An Essel Group Company), All rights reserved.
IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Gadgets Consumer Reports stands by its findings on Apple MacBook Pro, will not conduct tests again: Report Consumer Reports stands by its findings on Apple MacBook Pro, will not conduct tests again: Report Consumer Reports surprised customers when it refused to give recommended ratings to Apple’s new MacBook Pro series. By: Tech Desk | Updated: December 31, 2016 12:54 pm Consumer Reports surprised customers when it refused to give recommended ratings to Apple’s new MacBook Pro series. Consumer Reports has said it stands by its findings on Apple’s new MacBook Pro battery results. Consumer Reports’ director of electronics testing Maria Rerecich, in response to 9to5 Mac’s suggestion to run battery tests on MacBook Pro again, quoted several reasons for not going forward with it. Maria pointed out the team is confident of its results as they were performed using the right equipment and results were monitored closely. Rerecich’s statement to 9to5 Mac reads, “In this case, we don’t believe re-running the tests are warranted for several reasons. First, as we point out in our original article, experiencing very high battery life on MacBooks is not unusual for us – in fact we had a model in our comparative tests that got 19 hours. Second, we confirmed our brightness with three different meters, so we feel confident in our findings using this equipment. Finally, we monitor our tests very closely. There is an entry logged every minute, so we know from these entries that the app worked correctly.” Consumer Reports surprised customers, as well as Apple’s Senior Vice President Phil Schiller, when it refused to give recommended ratings to Apple’s new MacBook Pro series. The site, which conducted several tests on MacBook Pro 2016 series to evaluate display, performance etc noted that battery life of the laptops was ‘highly inconsistent’. Schiller tweeted out saying, “Working with CR to understand their battery tests. Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data.” Read: Apple MacBook Pro 2016 series fail Consumer Reports’ battery tests Consumer Reports’ team conducted tests on the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar and a 15-inch MacBook Pro. However, according to the website, the MacBook Pro battery life results were ‘highly inconsistent from one trial to the next’. It is worth noting these are the first set of MacBooks to not receive recommended ratings from Consumer Reports. In our review, we did not face any issues with the battery, except for one time when the battery seemed to have drained inexplicably. A full screen-on test on the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar with 100 per cent brightness, music streaming and playing at full volume and me working on Safari, Notes and Chrome gave us 4 hours and 20 minutes of juice, which is not bad. Meanwhile, Consumer Reports has put out another report with steps to fix Apple MacBook Pro’s battery issues. The report lists adjustments that can be made to the device that’ll help, though the root cause of the problem hasn’t been identified yet. “It’s possible that a software update from Apple would be able to correct the problem,” the report says. Must Read: Apple MacBook Pro 2016 review: Ideal for the power user Apple unveiled its new MacBook Pro series at its event on October 27. The new MacBook Pro series is supposed to be faster and change the way we interact with our computers. The new MacBook Pro series has a TouchBar and no function keys. The new generation MacBook Pro comes with four Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports and one 3.5mm headphone jack. Apple’s new MacBook Pro series is the thinnest and lightest one yet. Apple claims the MacBook Pro features the ‘brightest and most colourful Retina display yet’ with 500 nits of brightness. The device starts at Rs 1,29,900 for the 13-inch variant (256GB) without the TouchBar. The one with TouchBar costs Rs 1,55,900 for the 256GB version and Rs 1,72,900 for the 512GB storage option. The 15-inch display variant of Apple MacBook Pro is available in India at Rs 2,05,900 for 256GB storage variant. The 512GB option costs Rs 2,41,900. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Apple Best of Express PM Modi frames UP fight: Growth exiled for 14 yrs, give us majority EntertainmentDangal box office collection day 11: Aamir Khan film all set to take over Sultan as biggest hit of 2016 EntertainmentRaees: Dear Shah Rukh Khan, why are you so 'Zaalim' on us?

By Agamoni Ghosh December 31, 2016 06:47 GMT Sluggish sales has compelled the company to cut back production of iPhone 7 range from Q1 of 2017Reuters Apple is expected to cut the iPhone 7 range production by nearly 10% according to information based on data from suppliers as the phones have not been selling as expected. Nikkei reports that sluggish sales has compelled the company to cut back production from Q1 of 2017 and rather focus on the iPhone 8 that is going to be released in 2017, which also marks the 10th anniversary of Apple's iPhone. Although the iPhone 7 Plus featuring a dual-lens camera module is popular and high in demand due to the shortage of these camera sensors Apple has not been able to meet demand for the units. The company had slashed output for the iPhone 6s as well January-March 2016 as accumulated inventory of the model was unlikely to sell out and still remains with the company. Apple was pipped to get an advantage for iPhone 7 sales given the Galaxy Note 7, its closest competitor had to be discontinued due to safety hazards associated with the device. However, as per the report Apple has not been able to take advantage of the situation as Apple's holiday numbers are not expected to be that great. Earlier reports have hinted that despite the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, Samsung loyalists have stuck to their favourite brand. For Japan in particular the report claims the demand for the iPhone 7 is rather high partly due to the phone's compatibility with contactless IC chip readers used for services such as cashless payments. Sadly, Japan makes up just about 10% of the global smartphone market and its demand pattern cannot over power a general sluggish trend.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software iOS 10.3 Update with ‘Theater Mode’ Releasing in Early January By Uzair Ghani Posted Dec 30, 2016 9Shares Share Tweet Submit iOS 10.3 update with a new ‘Theater Mode’ feature is bound for release in early January, according to a reputable source. What is ‘Theater Mode’? Your Guess is as Good as Ours – iOS 10.3 Update is Going to be Interesting, Nonetheless According to Sonny Dickson, a man famous for leaking key Apple announcements ahead of time, has taken to Twitter to reveal that Cupertino is all set to release the iOS 10.3 update (in beta) on January 10th. Interestingly, not a lot of details are at hand, but what we do have right now is something which Apple might end up calling ‘Theater Mode’. That’s not just it though, it’s also rumored that this new feature will have its dedicated button in the Control Center, and will be shaped like a popcorn. Given how the term ‘theater mode’ is treated by many different outlets already, it’s likely that the feature will bring dark mode to iOS (at long last) if nothing else. But of course, there could be a surprise waiting for us which we do not know about currently. Also, given how close we are to January 10th, we will know very soon what Apple has wrapped for us in the gift box. Here are all the tweets Sonny Dickson sent pertaining to the upcoming iOS 10.3 update: iOS 10.3 to feature a new Theatre mode – will include a new popcorn-shaped Control Center icon. — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) December 30, 2016 iOS 10.3 beta 1 is scheduled to seed on January 10th. Advertisement — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) December 30, 2016 We will, as ever, update our readers whenever the first beta of iOS 10.3 becomes available. And it is highly likely that the first release will be aimed towards developers only, with public beta testers getting a taste of the build within the same week. The developer beta, as you can tell already, can be accessed only by those who have an Apple Developer Program membership. Public beta software on the other hand, is absolutely free to download and try. Wrap Up Theater Mode is going to be an interesting addition to iOS 10 as it is a feature many users have been asking for, including me. But given how Apple is planning to add a flagship feature to its current OS ahead of iOS 11, it makes us curious what the next-gen software will pack under the hood.

Opinion Anna Scantlin Contributing Editor | December 30, 2016 23 shares 10 13 0 0 0 0 0 0 0               2016 was kind of a weird year for mobile. We had some great new additions like the Google Pixel; we saw the Galaxy S line go from good to better between the S6 and the S7; the HTC 10 was a remarkable improvement over the HTC One M9; both LG and Lenovo had some creative ideas with their modular G5 and Moto Z, respectively; even Apple had a pretty solid year with the release of the iPhone SE and the iPhone 7. However, we’ve had some blunders as well. The Note 7 is probably the most notable, and recently reports have been surfacing stating that some Google Pixel and Nexus 6P devices have been mysteriously shutting down at 30-40% battery life. There’s also that weird phenomenon where manufacturers seem to think that removing the 3.5mm headphone jack is a good idea, but I would argue that most consumers don’t feel the same way. Thinking about the things I would like to see happen in 2017, I’ve come to the conclusion that there’s really not a whole lot on my list that I’m hoping for. I’m actually quite impressed with how far smartphones have come in such a seemingly short amount of time and feel that I really don’t have much of substance to complain about. Still, nothing is perfect, and there are still a couple of things that I would be happy to see come to fruition in 2017’s smartphone lineup. Better battery life I don't think I’ll ever feel like battery life shouldn’t be improved upon. The longer I can go without having to plug in my phone, the better. At this point I’m just happy that I can last an entire day (and often more) without absolutely needing to plug in my phone, but I would love to safely go a few days or longer without having to worry about charging my phone at all. The 3.5mm headphone jack stays Although more and more OEMs seem to be hopping on board with the idea – or are at the very least rumored to – I still don’t consider the move beneficial at all. I’m hoping this situation ends up like microSD cards; maybe it is old and outdated technology, but a lot of people still find it convenient and useful. USB-C for iPhones I’ve always harbored a resentment towards Apple for their chargers. Apple has always had different chargers even after smartphone manufacturers agreed to streamline their proprietary connectors to one universal connector, micro USB. I saw the usefulness in Apple’s chargers, but as somebody who frequently switched between iOS and Android it was somewhat of an annoyance to have to carry around two sets of chargers, and then later replace an entire collection of 30-pin connector accessories with Lightning. Fortunately, Apple seems to be embracing the new standard that the rest of the tech world is heading towards using, USB Type-C, as evidenced with its presence in Apple’s MacBook laptops. A Type-C port existing in MacBooks make me think that it’s possible for Apple to ditch Lightning in favor of Type-C in iPhones eventually, although probably not in 2017. No more glass backs Aside from aesthetically, I never understood the appeal of designing a phone with glass fronts and backs. It’s bad enough when you drop your phone and it lands face down and you spend a moment or two praying to your deity of choice that the glass didn’t shatter, but it’s kind of dumb when you do the same thing for the back of your phone as well. I didn’t understand it with my old iPhone 4S and I don’t understand it with the Galaxy S7. Glass is breakable, slippery, and a fingerprint magnet. It’s just not a good material to use on the backs of phones. I’m excited to see what 2017 brings us, but I really hope to see some of these ideas implemented as well – particularly better battery life and keeping the 3.5mm headphone jack around.

Cunningham 10:19 a.m. EST December 30, 2016 Daniel Cunningham (Photo: Provided) Daniel B. Cunningham is CEO of West Chester-based Long-Stanton Group. It has been pleasantly surprising to see recent discussions about how to manufacture iPhones in the United States, an idea I introduced in 2012. For Americans, making iPhones here would be a win all-around: for consumers, workers, Apple and increased U.S. growth. Consumers could order a customized iPhone online for next-day delivery. Order it with an extra-long-life battery, 100 percent pre-charged. You could design a purple and pink polka-dot back, chartreuse front, and brushed stainless steel sides. All your data will be downloaded to it. You'd receive it the next day, fully operational, and begin using it immediately, all without setting foot into a retail store. Would you pay $40-$50 more for this iPhone? Many would. China cannot complete with this American scenario. For workers, this flexible and automated manufacturing plant would supply a secure good living wage. A highly automated process would cancel the labor advantage China has. A seamlessly integrated process would make the plant a great place to work and have a career, with cutting-edge technologies to support success now and in the future. As President-elect Donald Trump said: ”We’ll make the robots, too.” Memo to Apple CEO Tim Cook: The technology to produce mass-customized iPhones I have described here will come in handy when you begin manufacturing Apple driverless cars. Anyone for a car that's purple with pink polka dots? Buy Photo Iphones could profitably be made in America, a West Chester CEO says.  (Photo: The Enquirer/Cara Owsley) U.S. growth would edge back toward the 3 percent level that America has not sustained this century. An economic decline that rocked the heartland and left median real wages below 1999 levels, America needs to elevate worker retraining to the level of the post-World War II GI Bill. Some pundits say the price of a U.S.-made iPhone would be much higher. iPhone 6s are estimated to cost $230 to make, and they sell for $749. The labor cost to make iPhones in China varies from $4 to $10, while American labor costs would be $30-$40. The American-made iPhones I envision would be assembled in highly automated plants, reducing the labor cost to the same as China or even less. (A Texas plant made Motorola Moto X phones, but shut down when break-even volumes were not reached.) Other pundits say the supply chain in America is not as quick as in China. Wrong. When Toyota broke ground on its first U.S. plant in Kentucky in 1986, there was little supplier support available. Toyota started with a mix of global and local suppliers. Over time, suppliers built up their local supply chains. Toyota become the largest car manufacturer in the world in 2008. Apple can use Toyota’s playbook, reducing political pressure. Let me suggest this: Make iPhones in America for Americans, and make iPhones in China for Chinese. Global supply chains mean that components are made all over the world. But once you start doing final assembly in one place, component manufacturing and the necessary skills will migrate to be near the final assembly point. Components come from all over the world to China, so the logistics cost of getting the global supply chain to work with an Apple assembler in the American heartland will probably not increase cost, but could reduce cost. How does Apple get an additional $1 billion in profit from making iPhones in America?  An estimate using Apple’s fiscal 2016 Q4 global iPhone sales of 45.5 million units times the non-international sales of 38 percent, suggests 69 million iPhones are sold in American yearly. Delivering the value-add and overnight delivery that I described above, an additional profit of $15 per unit (with a bit more for capital costs), and the $1 billion profit is now realized. No special tax breaks needed. Back in 2012, I suggested iPhones be built in Cincinnati. Airfreight terminals and shipping containers coming and going globally, via the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, provide inexpensive transportation. U.S. Sen. Ron Portman, an early and strong supporter of my idea, wrote a letter to Tim Cook inviting Apple to build iPhones in the Cincinnati region. Building the iPhone in America for Americans is a four-way gold mine for U.S. consumers, workers, Apple and U.S. growth. Not only are the benefits spread around, but it would be a shot in the arm for Americans, building the hope we are craving. 54 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2iMlA8W TOP VIDEOS Nashville star Sam Palladio talks about the new season 1:21 34 strikes in a row nets local bowler record for highest series 0:32 Big Mac lover Don Gorske eats number 29,000 1:52 Dolly Parton announces $1,000 per month donation for fire victims 1:23 Watch Google Home struggle to answer queries 1:34 Cole Swindell has ‘You Should be Here’ moment on CMA Awards red carpet 2:01 Cole Swindell talks about is favorite 30 seconds while on CMA Awards red carpet! 1:01 RaeLynn’s reaction to watching old clips from ‘The Voice’ is priceless! 0:50 What’s it like to be inducted into Country Music Hall of Fame?

Not for Sale: The Highly Touted Electronics That Missed the Market in 2016 Consumer Reports 3 days ago Electronics that didn't reach the market in 2016 What did 16-year-old Josh Joseph want for the holidays? The Melville, N.Y., high school junior wanted Apple AirPods. The same wireless earbuds that he'd been waiting patiently for since October. “The most fun part of a new product is that exciting feeling of waiting as launch day approaches,” he explained just before the holiday weekend, with thinly veiled exasperation. “So I was let down by the delay, but even more so by Apple’s inability to pin down an exact release date. A company with such wealth and scale should be able to consistently deliver on time, and it's disappointing whenever they don't.” Joseph was hardly alone. Though a limited quantity of the AirPods made it to market a couple of days before Christmas, a number of other high-profile products announced this fall, including the Samsung Galaxy Note7 smartphone and the GoPro Karma drone, weren’t available for holiday shoppers. Jonathan Sweetwood, owner of Unique Camera (which sells a variety of audio, video, and photography equipment) in Wayne, N.J., explains that when a consumer decides on a product only to find out that it's not available, it complicates what should be a straightforward transaction. “With some people it’s, ‘I’ve got to have the Apple AirPods,’” Sweetwood says. “But with others, we try to get down to the root of what their needs are and we try to find them a comparable product.” What’s behind these disappointing product launches? At least part of the blame goes to Wall Street. According to Jonathan Yarmis, a former electronics analyst with Gartner and now principal analyst with the Yarmis Group, the reason for these product delays is that with an eye toward the stock market’s expectations, companies are compressing their product development cycles. “Everybody now feels this incredible pressure to come to market quickly,” he explains. “We used to go to CES to find out what products were coming in the coming year. Now you go to CES to see what’s coming on Tuesday.” Though each product that wasn't available this holiday season followed its own path—some were recalled because of safety problems, and others were merely delayed—Yarmis sees a common theme: an accelerated product development cycle that leaves little time for testing and even less time to fix a problem once it's discovered.  When there's a glitch, Yarmis explains, it often results in finger pointing between competing factions within the company. “You have two conflicting groups within an organization," he says. "The marketing people who are saying 'Now! Yesterday!' and the product development guys who are saying, 'This isn’t simply a matter of issuing a press release. There are technological challenges. There are testing challenges.’” Increasingly, Yarmis notes, the marketers are winning these intramural battles. What does that mean for you? “The consumer is now the beta tester,” Yarmis says, half jokingly. As for Joseph, he didn't give up on his quest to make 2016 the year of the AirPod. He searched a site called iStockNow and tracked down a pair at a nearby Apple Store at Long Island's Roosevelt Field Mall.   Here’s a look at five "woulda, coulda, shoulda" products from late 2016 that stumbled on the path from introduction to consumers' hands. Samsung Galaxy Note7 The Product: Samsung’s top-of-the-line smartphone was introduced in August to compete with the iPhone 7 for this fall’s phone upgraders. The Problem: Shortly after the introduction, reports began filtering in that the lithium-ion batteries in these phones had begun exploding. That led to a recall, and then when replacement phones also started catching fire, to a second, wider recall that resulted in all of the phones being pulled from the market—sending consumers to other models. The Resolution: After the recalls—and a Federal Aviation Administration ban on Note7s on airplanes—Samsung finally gave up on introducing a Note7 model, and even took measures to make it impossible to use any Note7 phones still in consumers' hands. Apple AirPods The Product: Apple’s iPhone 7 was largely notable for what it didn’t have: a traditional headphone jack. While Apple fans debated the dongle question, Apple expected that the AirPod wireless earbuds that it announced at the same time would resolve this issue.  The Problem: The iPhone 7 hit the market in October, but the Air Pods remained in limbo. The company kept quietly pushing back the street date. Apple hasn't specified a reason for the delay, and published reports speculated on causes ranging from problems with Bluetooth to manufacturing problems. An Apple spokesman referred us to this statement, issued by the company in October: "The early response to AirPods has been incredible. We don't believe in shipping a product before it's ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers." The Resolution: Though a few lucky and/or resourceful Apple fans will get their AirPods this year, most users will have to wait until 2017. GoPro Karma Drone The Product: The Karma, which folds to fit in a backpack, was touted by many as the product that would make drones a mass-market phenomenon. The Problem: Three weeks after its mid-October introduction, GoPro received reports of several “in-flight failures,” a.k.a. drones falling out of the sky. The good news was that no injuries or property damage were associated with the failures. GoPro, with little help from the FAA or the Consumer Product Safety Commission, neither of which claimed jurisdiction over this issue, began its own recall. (Unlike a recall backed by regulators, the GoPro effort lacked governmental authority behind the effort to remove the product from store shelves.) The Resolution: The Karma was an important product for the struggling company, so GoPro went the extra mile to appease the consumers it inconvenienced. In addition to a full refund, early adopters of the Karma also got a $300 camera from the company. The Karma is now expected to return to store shelves early in 2017.  DJI Mavic Pro Drone The Product: This modestly priced personal flying machine was set to vie with the GoPro Karma for a share of the growing market of casual drone users. The Problem: Partly because of the Karma recall, demand for the Mavic Pro outstripped supply. The company failed to make its aggressive October launch date and reportedly began shipping small quantities of preordered drones in November. Later orders were subject to a backlog of around two months. The Resolution: Amazon currently lists the release date for the product as Feb. 10, 2017. Beats by Dr. Dre BeatsX The Product: Call them AirPods for the fashion conscious. The Beats version of Apple’s wireless earbuds, which share some technology with the AirPods, were also introduced in September and supposed to hit the market a month later. The Problems: The BeatsX seemed to share the same logistical issues—and the same delays—as the AirPods. The earbuds were scheduled to hit the market in mid-October, but that deadline has quietly slipped. Apple now says the BeatsX will be available in February. The Resolution: Dr. Dre undoubtedly has his pair already, but for the rest of us, the Beats X should be available in early 2017.

LOUIS, MO (KTVI) - Ballwin police are looking for the people involved in a smash and grab burglary that happened at an Apple repair shop early Friday morning. The owners of the I-Tech Shark store SAY someone used a boulder to do their dirty work. The crime was all caught on camera. Four people smashed their way into the I-Tech Shark Apple Repair Shop in the 14,800 block of Manchester in Ballwin. Owners say broke in at around 1am and boldly made a b-line to the back of the shop where they took more than $10,000 in Apple merchandise in less than 5 minutes. It was all captured on surveillance video. The store has been at the location for about three years and had two break-ins. The first was last January. Now they want the people in this video to pay for their crimes. "They knew where they were going. They went straight to the back, to our merchandise. That was strange. People don't go back there. If they did this, and other crimes, I hope they are caught and do a good amount of time," said Michael Slyman. Owners say none of their customer's phones were taken. The thieves left the register and iMAC at the front desk in tact. We're told none of of the other near by businesses were affected.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 31 December 2016 | MYT 8:00 AM Tiny AirPod will cost a bundle to replace by troy wolverton Whopping fee: Apple's charging a US$69 (RM309) replacement fee for each one of its wireless headphones, the company disclosed recently on a customer support web page. — Bay Area News Group/TNS If you lose an AirPod, you'll have to pay Apple a pretty penny to replace it.  Apple's charging a US$69 (RM309) replacement fee for each one of its wireless headphones, the company disclosed recently on a customer support web page. That's about 43% of the total cost of the US$159 (RM713) gadgets. And if you lose your charging case, you'll have to pay the same amount.  The iPhone maker announced that it's begun taking AirPod orders. The new gadgets come with a one-year limited warranty that only covers defects, not wear-and-tear from regular use. If you're having battery problems after the warranty expires, Apple will charge US$49 (RM219) to replace the ones in the AirPods themselves and another US$49 (RM219) to replace the one in their charging case.  If you damage the AirPods or the case – a situation that's likely not covered by the warranty – you'll have to pay US$69 (RM309) to replace the case and the same amount for each headphone.  Apple unveiled the AirPods in September when it rolled out the iPhone 7, the first of the company's smartphones to lack a headphone jack. The company is pushing wireless headphones as a replacement for wired ones that relied on that jack. — The Mercury News/Tribune News Service You May Be Interested Otterbox Defender: Making case for protection Watch YouTube videos in HDR Doubles 'goddess' Goh is now single Another viral video of another Ipoh 'daredevil' Traffic crawl along major highways Quality homes below RM400k Others Also Read At least 100 homes burned as fire erupts in Valparaiso, Chile Analysts negative on Felda deal Fund Managers' pick advertisement Latest News Seattle’s cloud-computing boom is new force driving regional economy What is cloud computing?

Apple AirPods: UK price, availability and do they work with Android? By Luke Edwards 30th Dec 2016 Features Tweet Apple AirPods are the new wireless earphones for your iPhone or iPad, but when can you buy them in the UK, how much do they cost and do Airpods work with Android mobile phones? Here's all you need to know about Apple AirPods. Apple has taken a big step towards its totally wireless future by releasing the wire-free AirPods earphones. These are two independent earphones that pop snuggly into your lug-holes, to offer battery-powered listening and voice recognition. The critical reception of Apple's AirPods has been rather mixed, as the earphones have plenty of positives but also a fair few negatives. And as they're rather pricey here in the UK and in other countries, purchasing them can be a tricky decision. That's why we've compiled this all-you-need-to-know AirPods guide, so you're fully informed before commiting to Apple's wireless ear buddies. Apple AirPods UK price The Apple AirPods are a cool new technology for the company so, as you’d expect, they’re not cheap. You’ll need to splash out a hefty £159 to snap up a pair of these, which includes the wireless charging case and a Lightning-to-USB cable to charge the case's built-in battery (which in turn charges the AirPods). Lose any part of the setup, be it an earpiece or the charging case itself, and you’re a bit stuck really. Bearing in mind that’s easy to do with them all wirelessly separate, you might want to consider adding insurance to that price tag too. Apple Airpods setup process: How do I pair my earphones with my iPhone, iPad and other Apple devices? One of the great advantages of AirPods over other wireless headphones is their simple connectivity with Apple devices. Hold them and the charging case near one of your Apple gadgets and they’ll automatically pair using NFC, then instantly work across your other Apple devices, including Watches, Mac computers and iPads. It's all perfectly seamless, thanks to iCloud. Apple AirPods: Do they work with Android devices? AirPods do indeed work with Android phones and other devices, but the experience isn't so seamless and user-friendly. AirPods can be connected to Android devices, as well as computers, just like you can pair up normal Bluetooth headphones. But you’ll need to pair them the old fashioned way, by finding them in your device's BT settings. You also won’t get access to all of the best AirPod features, while battery life may also suffer if not used with Apple devices. How good is the battery life of Apple AirPods? AirPod battery life is good, but it can also be great. Thanks to the wireless charging case you can go for up to 24 hours between charges, or so claims Apple. Your AirPods will last for five hours on a charge when connected with an iPhone 7, with other less optimised devices lowering that. But pop them back in the case and a 15-minute charge will offer three more hours of use, totalling 24 hours in all before the case also runs out of juice. Not bad at all then, presuming you’re using an iPhone 7. Apple AirPods are more than just wireless earphones One of the really fun features of the AirPods is the way they work. They’re 'always on' and so always connected. As a result, all you need to do is pop them in your lugholes to listen. Infrared sensors let them know when they’re in your ears and ready for action. And if you drop from two to one when using them with an iPhone, it’ll switch from stereo to mono so you get the complete audio experience in that one ear. When you want to skip track, change volume or ask Siri something, you just double tap an AirPod's external surface. Thanks to motion sensors it’ll react immediately, allowing you to verbally request a command - and this is accurate too, thanks to the built-in smart mics (see below). Do the Apple AirPods have voice recognition and Siri support? Voice commands with the AirPods is a super smart experience thanks to beamforming built-in mics, which work with the motion sensors to detect when you’re talking. This can then filter out background noise to offer the best possible voice recognition and audio quality, ideal for both Siri controls and for calls. All these smarts and sensors are run by Apple’s M1 chip, developed specifically for the AirPods. That means smart controls while also offering the most efficient use of battery. Are the Apple AirPods good for exercise? The Apple AirPods design has been the subject of much debate. Some enjoy the minimalism and style, while others have called them ugly, cheap and basic. It comes down to personal preference. What doesn’t, however, is their fit. While the AirPods sit snugly in most ears. there are no options to change earbuds for a different size of fit. So if these don’t comfortably lodge in your ears, bad luck. They should sit fine for day to day use, in most people’s case, but don’t expect them to remain in place while running. It’s a shame since the price tag is so high, meaning most people will need to spend even more if they want running headphones too. That’s a double shame when you consider these work with the Apple Watch, which could let you run with music minus your phone. AirPods vs EarPods: Is there a difference in sound quality? Despite being newer, the Apple AirPods are reportedly the same as Apple's EarPods in terms of sound quality. That’s not bad, but not great either. Expect a decent amount of bass, but not heavy boom. These replicate AAC audio, says Apple, but won’t necessarily blow you away. That fit, with plastic earpieces that don’t mould to the ear, may be part of the issue - meaning more background noise bleeding in. The lofry asking price makes this issue more of a problem for those seeking higher quality audio reproduction. If these were run friendly, the quality issue may have been more easily overlooked. But since AirPods are for day-to-day use, sound quality is a seriously important feature for many.

Now Apple is in Santa Clara County Superior Court fighting a lawsuit by the surviving family members. Apple is responsible for the girl’s death, her parents and sister alleged in the lawsuit, because Wilhelm had the firm’s FaceTime video-calling app up on his iPhone 6 Plus before and during the “distracted driving” crash — while Apple sat on patented technology that could prevent people from using FaceTime while driving at highway speed. Apple, the suit said, applied in 2008 for a patent on a “driver handheld computing device lockout” intended to stop texting while driving at highway speed, and should have applied the technology to FaceTime. The lockout could be achieved using the accelerometer and GPS already in phones, suggested the suit, which accused Apple of “gross negligence.” None of the allegations have been proven in court. Apple did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Wilhelm, 21, was charged with manslaughter, according to the Denton Record-Chronicle. “Wilhelm, who was 20 at the time, told police he was using his cell phone when the accident occurred,” the paper reported in August 2015. “The call was still active when the phone was located at the accident scene.” Wilhelm’s jury trial is scheduled for Feb. 27, the paper said. The lawsuit cites data on increasing mobile-device use by drivers and rising traffic fatalities. Texas allows adults to use cell phones while driving. The city of Denton, where the crash occurred, had a ban on texting while driving, but it didn’t apply to interstate highways, the Record-Chronicle reported. The suit was brought by the dead child’s parents, Bethany and James Modisette, and her sister Isabella, all injured in the wreck, James critically. They are seeking unspecified damages, according to the lawsuit filed Dec. 23 and published by Courthouse News Service. Photo illustration: An iPhone held up in front of the Apple logo.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Rollover crash turns Apple Valley intersection into four-way stop Friday Friday Dec 30, 2016 at 5:59 PM Dec 30, 2016 at 6:07 PM Paola Baker Staff Writer @DP_PaolaBaker APPLE VALLEY — Authorities said a woman suffered minor injuries after a rollover crash on Highway 18 Friday afternoon. The crash caused a Toyota Tacoma pickup truck to overturn and crash into a traffic controller at the intersection of Highway 18 and Quinnault Road, briefly blocking eastbound lanes and turning the intersection into a four-way stop. Apple Valley Sheriff’s station Deputy G. Teplansky said the crash occurred just before 3 p.m. Friday as the Tacoma and a white Cadillac were headed east on Highway 18. The woman in the Tacoma slowed for a red light but the driver of the Cadillac failed to slow in time, Teplansky said, causing it to skid and strike the rear of the truck. The Cadillac then skidded underneath the Tacoma, causing the truck to overturn before it crashed into the controller box and a nearby crosswalk sign. Teplansky said the truck landed on its wheels. The woman in the Tacoma was taken to a local hospital with a complaint of pain, while the passengers in the Cadillac reported no injuries on scene. No other injuries were reported. Teplanksy said Caltrans personnel were requested to repair the traffic control box. The intesection was expected to remain as a four-way stop for about three hours until their arrival, but eastbound lanes were open by 3:30 p.m. The cause of the crash is not yet known, but Teplansky said alcohol, drugs or speed are not believed to be contributing factors. The crash remains under investigation by the Apple Valley Sheriff’s station. Paola Baker may be reached at 760-955-5332 or PBaker@VVDailyPress.com. Follow her on Twitter at @DP_PaolaBaker.

However over the years, Chinese OEMs have managed to ramp things up considerably by introducing an avalanche of products that are comparable in performance, but sometimes at half the price. This has led to many Chinese brands dominating markets that companies like Apple and Samsung have typically flourished in. However it seems that nothing lasts forever because according to a report from DigiTimes, various Chinese OEMs such as Huawei, Xiaomi, and LeEco are apparently looking to cut back on component orders in Q1 2017. While China is indeed a massive market with huge potential, it seems that the market is already saturated not just with phones from local companies, but also foreign ones from the likes of Apple and Samsung. This by no means indicates that any of these companies are in trouble, but rather it is just them reacting to the market and situation as it is. In fact a recent report has also revealed that Apple could potentially be looking to cut back production as well by as much as 10% in the first quarter of the new year, so this shouldn’t really be that surprising. However both LeEco and Xiaomi have plans to launch in the US, so if successful production could ramp back up again to meet the demand in the new markets. Filed in Cellphones >Rumors.

The arguments over illegal state-aid and the €13bn in back taxes which the EU’s Margrethe Vestager ruled that phone giant Apple owes this State will, thankfully, start to grind through European courts. The drawn-out legal appeals process will provide some sort of relief from the public relations flack put up by the principal players which included a lot of the faux outrage over the Brussels’ ruling from the Government and Apple. Much heat was generated last summer but, despite the size of the tax demand, markets were nonplussed. Shares in Apple — a behemoth valued at €593bn and which holds a remarkable cash hoard of over €200bn — have risen since Ms Vestager’s August decision. READ NEXT Paul Mills: Amid the risks, our leaders need to up their game Investors view a tax bill of €13bn as so much chump change for the world’s most valuable corporation, and the phone giant’s shares ended the year 10% higher. There was also no market evidence that rock-bottom costs of borrowing for the Government here flickered at all, despite it committing to appealing a ruling that would have given it €13bn, an enormous windfall that would lop a significant chunk from the country’s debt pile. For any state, never mind one that has so recently emerged from near bankruptcy, to turn down a sizeable bounty suggests that big issues are playing out behind the scenes. As the Irish Examiner reported before the ruling, in April, there were signals that the Government had accepted it had lost Ms Vestager’s state aid investigation, but had anticipated a decision involving a much smaller fine, maybe one amounting to as little as €150m. The Government nonetheless decided at this early stage to appeal any adverse ruling that implied the State had cut some sort of sweetheart deal with a multinational. Later, ministers and officials explained their decision to appeal the decision with comments about sovereignty and defending the State’s tax regime from Brussels’ bureaucrats. Ireland and its tax dealings with US multinationals has not been alone in facing scrutiny from Ms Vestager’s probe. But the €13bn clawback from Apple ensured the unflattering international spotlight on Ireland’s tax dealings would not fade away, as had happened with other high-profile adverse EU rulings. Apple is box office after all. Almost all the candidates in the race for the White House had slammed Ireland over so-called tax inversion deals. And it’s easy to forget that it wasn’t Brussels but Washington lawmakers who first drew up the allegations that Ireland had cut a too sweet deal with the most valuable company in the world. A Senate sub-committee committee, in May 2013, claimed US taxpayers were losing billions of dollars in global revenues generated by Apple. The same hearing heard that Apple had paid next to nothing in tax on the global billions passing through two or three firms incorporated in Ireland. The Senate committee’s investigation caught the Government on the hop. It was also to provide a handy roadmap for a newly installed Commission in Brussels to pursue its own investigations into tax arrangements of multinationals in Europe. In the mix, too, are the renewed plans by commissioner tax czar Pierre Moscovici to revive the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base proposal, which even if adopted in a scaled-back version would call time on Ireland’s tax lure that includes the 12.5% rate and ‘knowledge box’ incentives. Yet the Government has effectively a two-way bet in its appeal against the Commission’s encroachment: Launch the appeal and be seen to fight for a continuing flow of projects into Ireland at a time when the election of Donald Trump promises tougher times ahead for US investments in Europe; or after long years legal wrangling if it were to lose the appeal and collect a substantial windfall. But there is another tax issue involving Apple that TDs should probably pay more attention to. In July this year, the CSO, through no fault of its own, had to revise Irish GDP growth figures for 2015 and following common Eurostat rules came up with the infamous 26.3% annual growth surge. No normal advanced economy records enormous growth numbers. The revision led to the partly amusing, partly offensive jibe by Nobel economics laureate Paul Krugman of “leprechaun economics”. The Irish Examiner subsequently reported that Apple was the main driver behind the extraordinary revision, as it re-arranged its international tax affairs by transferring huge amounts of its intellectual property here. Recently, the Irish Examiner reported Apple had communicated with the CSO last summer, reminding the Government agency of its confidentiality rules. Apple’s exercise was an accounting procedure but, presumably, involved contract manufacturing in China being counted as if it were done on Irish soil. It will be revealing to see what happens to GDP figures here as Apple ramps up production of new phones in the future. Apple’s accounting had another huge effect in widening the country’s tax base. Ask many senior economists and they will tell you that Apple was also the leading multinational that helped lead to the Government last year collecting €2.3bn more than anticipated in corporate tax revenues. But no Government minister or official will admit as much. Next week, the Finance Department will release the 2016 tax returns which will show again that corporate tax revenues are taking in a huge haul. It’s time the secrecy surrounding this other Apple tax issue was lifted.

In May, Apple had announced setting up a design and development accelerator in the City to grow the iOS developer community.  The announcement was made during the visit of Apple CEO Tim Cook to India.  The Cupertino-based company has been in discussions with Indian government seeking incentives to set up a manufacturing unit in the country.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Not so SMART phone: Delhi bus drivers continue to talk and...

Apple also seems to have been caught off guard by the demand for its wireless earbuds, with many in-store locations already selling out of $219 CAD headphones. Prior to the AirPods official release, it was rumoured that Apple had delayed the wireless earphones due to manufacturing issues, though they eventually hit store at the start of the holiday shopping season. If you’ve been waiting to get your hands on AirPods, however, there are a number of Canadian Apple Stores that currently have the headphones in stock as of December 30th. Apple’s AirPods are also available for order from its Canadian website, though the shipping estimate comes in at six weeks. We’ve rounded up every Canadian Apple Store that has AirPods in stock below: Apple Carrefour Laval 3035, boulevard Le Carrefour, local C14B, H7T 1C8 Laval, Quebec Apple Chinook Centre 6455 Macleod Trail SWm T2H 0K8 Calgary, Alberta Apple Conestoga 550 King Street, N2L 5W6 Waterloo, Ontario Apple Coquitlam Centre 2829 Barnet Highway, V3B 5R5 Coquitlam, British Columbia Apple Eaton Centre 220 Yonge Street, M5B 2H1 Toronto, Ontario Apple Fairview 1800 Sheppard Avenue East, M2J 5A7 Toronto, Ontario Apple Fairview Pointe-Claire 6801, autoroute transcanadienne, H9R 5J2 Pointe-Claire, Quebec Apple Guildford Town Centre 10355 152 Street, V3R 7C1 Surrey, CBritish Columbia Apple Halifax Shopping Centre 7001 Mumford Road, B3L 4N9 Halifax, Nouvelle-Écosse Apple Mapleview Centre 900 Maple Avenue, L7S 2J8 Burlington, Ontario Apple Market Mall 3625 Shaganappi Trail NW, T3A 0E2 Calgary, Alberta Apple Markville Shopping Centre 5000 Highway 7 East, L3R 4M9 Markham, Ontario Apple Masonville 1680 Richmond Street North, N6G 3Y9 London, Ontario Apple Metrotown 320 4700 Kingsway, V5H 4J2 Burnaby, British Columbia Apple Pacific Centre 701 West Georgia Street, V7Y 1G5 Vancouver, Colombie-Britannique Apple Place Ste-Foy 2450 Boulevard Laurier, G1V 2L1 Québec, Quebec Apple Polo Park 1485 Portage Avenue, R3G 0W4 Winnipeg, Manitoba Apple Sherway Gardens 25 The West Mall, M9C 1B8 Toronto, Ontario Apple Square One 100 City Centre Drive, L5B 2C9 Mississauga, Ontario Apple Upper Canada Mall 17600 Yonge Street, L3Y 4Z1 Newmarket, Ontario Apple Yorkdale 3401 Dufferin Street, M6A 3A1 Toronto, Ontario Shogun Who wants this çrap really. An overpriced piece of hardware that is nowhere near justifiable in price and certainly not in quality Eric Tang I must say that the double-tapping on the earpod is very difficult and I am lucky if it registers my tapping; exchanged for another one and it has the same issue…additionally the lack of volume control on the pod itself is a big let down for me… Shogun You were a sucker to buy that crap in the first place. Eric Tang Well I like to try it anyway. Shogun For the money? Seriously? To each his own but really there are better choices out there for BT headphones. Usually I’d say most of what Apple makes is worth tryIng but these didn’t fit that bill. AdamC284 As much as I’m not a fan as many people here, you can currently order them through Best Buy as well. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/87dbfe59a8e30491d579f69a688a4a8a3d40f1af8a3e15480833a66ac936a43a.png Jonathan Thanks a lot, Patrick! Great post! Peking Duck First 2 locations are in France and half way down you have a Spanish location….hehe KBoland Nothing like fact checking the article you’re writing before hitting the submit button. This site is becoming a joke… Shogun The bigger question is why this is even a story. I mean who cares what store carries what but its obvious that its much-needed page filler and there is a need to churn out as much fluff to give the impression these guys are earning their pay for the little work they do here. What MS needs is some solid editorial commentary that drills down in the nuts and bolts of technology and its positive and negative impacts on society. A little analysis of the industries wouldn’t hurt either. I think they try in their SyrupCasts but something written would be a nice addition to the site and would give it far more substance than it has. KBoland You hit the nail on the head my friend. J-Ro These are really ideal for the gym. Countless times I seen people tangled in their cords or breaking their screens from having the phones too close. This will always be a top seller because of that one industry. Smanny How can you say these are ideal for the gym. Maybe they fit perfectly snug in your ears. However there are other earbuds that a much better for the gym. They even give you multiple ear tips so literally one size fits all. The other thing is some other earbuds offer built in music, that can last up to 3 hours, so no need to carry your phone to the gym at all. Plus some of them offer fitness tracking, and play back controls. All of which is missing from Apples airpods. Clearly you don’t know what is currently offered on the market. Not to mention if you want some better sounding Bluetooth headsets, then there are a number of them that are half the price or less. Randy I am getting the AirPods because it doesn’t use plasticky ear tips and it is true cordless. I have a jaybird and it is constantly falling because when I am wiping my sweat off my head with a towel, the wire that connect the 2 earbuds get accidentally pulled.

The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus did good when they were launched this September, but many Apple fans were not really convinced with the idea of upgrading their handsets this year. It won’t be surprising if consumers will not upgrade their smartphones early next year either.  Given the situation that Apple is in, it appears the Cupertino giant has already planned of adjusting the number of devices it will be making in the first quarter of 2017. Reuters has learned from Nikkei that Apple has decided to trim production of its new iPhones by 10 percent based off of suppliers’ calculations.  An Apple spokesperson has declined to comment on the new information from suppliers. But looking back at this year’s Q1 production, Apple also did some adjustments on the production of its iPhones. From January through March 2016, the company slashed its output by 30 percent as per its inventory. Therefore, it isn’t a major shocker to hear news about the decrease in iPhone production starting next month.  Related Stories Apple AirPods: Supplier Expanding Production After High Demand iPhone 8 Rumors: Samsung To Supply Apple with AMOLED Panels Should You Buy Or Sell Apple Stock? Aside from the reduced output, new information from industry sources claims that Apple is also manufacturing iPhones in India in 2017. The industry sources have said that Apple’s Taiwanese manufacturer Wistron has plans of assembling more iPhones in Bangalore starting in April of next year. This initiative is seen as an advantage to Apple because India is one of the fastest-growing smartphone markets at present, according to Fortune. Meanwhile, Apple is also busy preparing its next flagship smartphones. If the latest rumors are to be believed, the tech giant could be releasing three iPhone 8 models next year: a 4.7-inch, 5.5-inch and 5.8-inch variants. Per our latest coverage of the iPhones, Samsung is going to supply Apple with curved display panels for the OLED version. Contrariwise, the other two models are sporting LCD screens.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Alas, according to Japan's Nikkei, 2017 is set to begin with a whimper, not a bang, as Apple will trim production of its iPhones by at least 10% in the first quarter of 2017. The latest disappointing news comes after the company slashed output in January-March 2016 due to accumulated inventory of the iPhone 6s line at the end of 2015. That experience led Apple to curb production of the iPhone 7, introduced in September, by around 20%. But the phones still have sold more sluggishly than expected. Information on production of the latest models and global sales suggests cuts in both the 7 and 7 Plus lines in the coming quarter. The larger iPhone 7 Plus, which features two cameras on its back face, remains popular. But a shortage of camera sensors has curbed Apple's ability to meet demand for the phones. U.S. research company IDC forecasts global smartphone shipments in 2016 on par with the 2015 level. Even Apple has had difficulty creating appealing new features, stifling demand from customers who otherwise would look to upgrade to the latest device. The Nikkei notes that while Japanese demand for the iPhone 7 line is strong, thanks in part to the phone's compatibility with contactless IC chip readers, commonly used for services such as payment. Japan makes up just 10% or so of the global smartphone market, and cannot compensate for sluggishness overall. Japanese component producers will again feel pain from the coming cuts. But orders from Chinese smartphone makers, as well as growing demand for automobile technology linked to automated driving, will soften the blow. *A source at a major parts producer called Apple's production cut "within expectations," saying the company has reduced the role Apple plays in its overall business*. For those expecting the same pace of growth out of Apple they have been used to for the past few years, that last statement is the last thing they wanted to hear. In response to the news, AAPL stock has dropped to intraday lows. » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: The Street - 3 days ago< > Embed Apple Reportedly Will Cut iPhone7 Production in the First Quarter 00:28 Shares of Apple ( ) were under pressure Friday after a Japanese newspaper reported the tech giant might cut iPhone production by 10% in the first quarter.

Apple to Cut iPhone 7 Production Due to Disappointing Sales GO Report claims production could be trimmed by 10 percent Dec 30, 2016 22:38 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  ​ Apple launched the iPhone 7 with much fanfare in the fall, but the lack of innovation and the similarities between the new model and its predecessor are dramatically affecting sales, with Cupertino now preparing a substantial decrease in production, a new report states. Japanese daily Nikkei reveals that Apple plans to trim production of the iPhone by as much as 10 percent in the first quarter of the next year particularly because both the standard and the Plus models are selling fewer units than expected. Surprisingly, the Plus has become more successful than the smaller iPhone, Nikkei writes, but its sales are below expectations as well because of a different reason. It looks like a shortage of camera sensors is impacting sales of the iPhone 7 Plus because Apple can’t build enough units to cope with demand - the Plus comes with a dual-camera system that uses two lenses instead of one, thus requiring more complex hardware than a traditional model. Apple still claiming the iPhone 7 is a hit Apple is obviously yet to acknowledge the rumored adjustments of iPhone 7 production, but such news wouldn’t come as a big surprise given the fact that Cupertino already reduced production of this model in September because of iPhone 6s inventories. The same source notes that Apple was forced to cut production of the iPhone 7 just before its launch by 20 percent because of the existing iPhone 6s stock. The iPhone 7 is very similar in terms of looks and features to its predecessor, while at the same time causing controversy and criticism due to a number of changes, such as the removal of the headphone jack. These have all contributed to declining demand for the iPhone, with Apple now believed to be putting all of its hopes into the next-generation model celebrating the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. Rumor has it that the 2017 iPhone would come with many more improvements, including an OLED display, as well as new features, such as wireless charging and a bezel-less design. #Apple#iPhone#iPhone 7#iPhone production subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple to Start iPhone Production in India Next Year First iPhone 7 Jailbreak (iOS 10.1.1) Now Available for Download The Jet White iPhone 7 Looks Stunning in This Mockup - Video 5-Inch iPhone to Launch Next Year with Vertical Dual-Camera System New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    iPhone 7 sales not going exactly as Apple hoped new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Designed by Apple, Built by Robots: iPhone Maker Gets Rid of Human Workers more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

The lawsuit alleges that Apple had patented but unimplemented technology that could lock out FaceTime to prevent distracted driving. That patent, filed in 2008 and approved in 2014, would prevent users from activating or using FaceTime while driving, utilizing a motion and scenery analyzer to lock out certain features under certain conditions. This is similar to the limitations that were placed on Pokémon that restricts the game's use while above a certain speed. The driver involved in the accident admitted to police that he was using Apple's FaceTime app on his iPhone when he collided with the other car. In fact, according to Courthouse News, FaceTime was still running when the police arrived. The Modisettes, the family of the young girl that was killed, say that Apple either failed to shut off the app or failed to give enough of a warning about how dangerous it is to use FaceTime while driving. The lawsuit claims Apple should be held accountable because it didn't implement the patented lock-out feature. Whether the claim has merit will be decided in court, but the logic behind the complaint is troubling. Patent protection is an important incentive for companies to innovate, and precedent that requires safety-related patents to be utilized (instead of giving the company the discretion to make that decision) could stifle creativity. It's unclear at this point why Apple decided not to utilize this technology, but it could certainly have valid reasons.

It was a busy year for Apple, and as an Apple customer I got to see this year’s updates in iOS and macOS. I’d like to share my three favorite apps that I’ve used this year. Cryptomator Cryptomator is a piece of open source software that gives you encryption for files you store in the cloud. It’s different than encrypted cloud storage providers like Mega or SpiderOak because it’s client-side. Cryptomator encrypts your files before it uploads them to the cloud. It works with Google Drive, iCloud Drive, Dropbox and OneDrive. Choosing a cloud provider Although iCloud Drive is already encrypted, I personally feel a bit better using this app. Cryptomator also has desktop apps for Windows, macOS and Linux. Some might consider this iOS app a bit pricey at $4.99, but you’re helping to support a small development team and keeping your data secure at the same time. Download it on the App Store. RNI Flashback I take a lot of photos with my iPhone, and I use a handful of editing apps. An interesting app I found is called RNI Flashback. RNI, or Really Nice Images, calls it a “pretty scientific experiment in photo processing.” The app’s main focus is film emulation—evoking the look of pre-digital photos. Editing Interface The company does this in a unique way, by using real film data to simulate how film layers combine when processing colors. Unlike other editing apps, there are no predefined filters. You tap a button to randomize the virtual “chemicals” to get an infinite variety of looks. RNI Flashback is $3.99 and completely worth it to make your photos stand out on Instagram. Download it on the App Store. Curiosity If you love learning new things, check out Curiosity’s app. Every day it presents you with random facts, deemed “most interesting.” You can also dive into a wide variety of subjects like art, history, math, science, etc. Daily Trivia At first glance, you’ll see each image with a fact on it. You can keep swiping, or choose to read the article given with each fact. It often provides a YouTube video about the subject too. The app is one of the first things I check in the morning, and I love learning random bits of trivia. Best of all, Curiosity is free, so check it out on the App Store.

Apple Still Planning to Bring the Watch Digital Crown on iPhones GO New patent shows Apple explores Digital Crown expansion Dec 30, 2016 22:02 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  ​ The Apple Watch Digital Crown is a neat little feature that makes a lot of sense on a smartwatch, especially because it benefits from the high build quality that Apple has become famous for, but it looks like Cupertino is already looking beyond the wrist to expand this control method. A new patent discovered by PatentlyApple shows that Apple wants to bring the Digital Crown on more devices in its portfolio, including the iPhone and the iPad, in a way that would provide owners with an additional touch input giving more accurate control of certain features. While it’s not yet clear how Apple would integrate the Digital Crown in the iPhone design, the company explains in the patent that this feature could be used to control what it’s being called a cube-based user interface in the operating system. Digital Crown’s purpose on an iPhone Users can thus easily rotate the Digital Crown to switch between multiple screens using a cube-like UI, similar to what some Android devices already offer. Apple thinks that this could lead to better organization of iPhone tasks, with the available screens integrated into this cube to play the role of small profiles that users can switch between by simply rotating the Digital Crown, such as work, home, and others. Additionally, the Digital Crown can be used for a variety of other tasks as well, including controlling the volume easily when listening to music - this makes sense given the fact that Apple is already exploring ways to make the iPhone bezel-less, which means that the company could give up on the side volume buttons. Resizing text in a browser could be another helpful feature of the Digital Crown, and so could be zooming in and out photos and other types of content. Certainly, Apple has more in mind when it comes to bringing this little Apple Watch feature on more of its devices, but for the moment, this is just in patent stage and there’s no evidence that mass production is prepared. It’s the second time we hear about such a plan, though, so don’t be too surprised if at some point in the future the Digital Crown shows up on an iPhone. #Apple#Apple Watch#iPhone#Digital Crown subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news iPhone X Concept Imagines the Anniversary iPhone Launching Next Year Apple to Start iPhone Production in India Next Year Apple Sued After iPhone Driver Using FaceTime Caused Fatal Accident iOS Bug Can Crash Messages App on Any New iPhone New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    Apple thinks the Digital Crown has a future beyond the wrist New ios.

This comes after the company slashed output in January-March 2016 due to accumulated inventory of the iPhone 6s line at the end of 2015. That experience led Apple to curb production of the iPhone 7, introduced in September, by around 20%. But the phones still have sold more sluggishly than expected. Information on production of the latest models and global sales suggests cuts in both the 7 and 7 Plus lines in the coming quarter. Nikkei says the larger iPhone 7 Plus is still popular but a shortage of camera sensors has prevented Apple from meeting demand. Demand in Japan for the iPhone 7 is strong; however, the country accounts for only about 10% of the market. Japanese component producers will again feel pain from the coming cuts. But orders from Chinese smartphone makers, as well as growing demand for automobile technology linked to automated driving, will soften the blow. Despite the negative reports, Apple still dominated the holiday season, activating over double the number of smartphones that Samsung did.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Liberty Utilities gives back in a big way Friday Dec 30, 2016 at 1:49 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — The town’s largest water provider partnered with several local organizations to provide more than $14,000 in donations to families in need throughout December. During the holiday season, Liberty Utilities, Apple Valley provided 120 Zacky Farm gift certificates to families in Apple Valley and Yermo, donated 100 pairs of shoes and socks to schoolchildren and treated 40 boys at the Cooper Home to Target gift cards. Employees also raised $8,300 throughout the year for the local chapter of the United Way, donated $1,000 to the Sunset Hills Children’s Foundation, contributed another $1,000 to High Desert Homeless Services and delivered clothing to to students at Yermo School. In a statement, Business Administration Manager Kristin Davenport said the company enjoyed making “the holidays a little brighter for children and families in the communities we serve.” In addition to partnering with the Desert Communities Region chapter of the Inland Empire United Way and the Sunset Hills Children’s Foundation, the company teamed with San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department’s Barstow Station, the Apple Valley Schools Foundation and the Happy Trails Children’s Foundation during its month of charity, the statement shows. “We truly appreciate the partnerships with these wonderful organizations that have such a positive impact in the region,” Davenport said. The 100 pairs of new shoes and socks were given via AVSF’s Shoe Bank Project to benefit Apple Valley Unified School District students. Meanwhile, the donation to HDHS will work to help High Desert residents “who have been displaced from long-term housing due to natural disaster or loss of income,” as well as provide short-term emergency shelter for non-residents. Toys donated by Liberty employees also were delivered to the Barstow Sheriff’s Station for distribution to local children. “Giving back to the community is part of our mission,” Davenport said. “It is especially fulfilling to see our company’s commitment and support of the worthy organizations and causes our team cares so deeply about.” Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254.

The S&P 500 technology sector's 0.72 percent drop put the broader index on track for its third straight day of declines, its longest losing streak since Nov. 4. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was set for its first weekly decline since the U.S. election. The rally had pushed the index to within 13 points of 20,000 last week, but after three straight days of losses, the index is now about 200 points shy. "The market is ending 2016 with a whimper. We entered the rally like a lion, but are leaving like a lamb," said Andre Bakhos, managing director of Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. "It is disappointing on many levels as investors believed that we are going to see the Dow at 20,000. The euphoria that was in motion in the Trump rally has fizzled." Until Thursday, the three main Wall Street indexes were set to end the year with double-digit percentage gains. The S&P is now on track to post a gain of 9.7 percent for the year, the Nasdaq 7.8 percent and the Dow 13.7 percent. At 12:35 p.m. ET (1735 GMT) the Dow was down 20.2 points, or 0.1 percent, at 19,799.58, the S&P 500 was down 5.87 points, or 0.26 percent, at 2,243.39 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 38.38 points, or 0.71 percent, at 5,393.71. Seven of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower, with technology and consumer discretionary stocks taking the biggest hit. Apple was the biggest drag on all three indexes, falling 0.6 percent to $115.98 after the Nikkei financial daily reported that the company would cut production of the iPhone by about 10 percent. Apple suppliers also dropped on the news. Qualcomm, Skyworks Solutions, Cirrus Logic and Qorvo were down between 1 percent and 2 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,444 to 1,402. On the Nasdaq, 1,795 issues fell and 1,004 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed one new 52-week high and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 35 new highs and 36 new lows.

In subdued holiday trading, the S&P 500 declined for a third consecutive session. But the benchmark index still tallied an annual gain of 9.5 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 13.4 percent for 2016, even as it recorded its first weekly decline since the U.S. election on Nov. 8. Stocks stalled this week after surging in the wake of Donald Trump's presidential election. Investors have bet Trump will cut taxes and regulations and introduce fresh economic stimulus. "It's been such a significant run-up that there's been a pause," said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. "We are to the point now where there's uncertainty with regard to what policies are implemented, when are they implemented and how are they going to affect the economy as a whole and industries specifically." The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 57.18 points, or 0.29 percent, to 19,762.6, the S&P 500 lost 10.43 points, or 0.46 percent, to 2,238.83 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 48.97 points, or 0.9 percent, to 5,383.12. The Dow slipped further from the 20,000 milestone, after coming within 13 points of the mark but not yet breaching it. The Dow is now up about 8 percent since the election. "It's been quite a rally, so not surprised to see some profit taking," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer with Solaris Asset Management in New York. "There might be some reality setting in that a lot of this rally is based on assumptions of stimulus legislation occurring, and it's really the market's hope that those actions occur and that there isn't a heated battle and a water down of some of these indicated proposals by the soon-to-be new administration," Ghriskey said. Apple shares fell 0.8 percent after a report that the company will trim iPhone production. Shares of Apple suppliers such as Cirrus Logic and Qualcomm also declined. Tech was the worst-performing major S&P sector, falling 1 percent. Big tech names such as Microsoft and Alphabet slumped more than 1 percent. Investors are wary that the market could be primed for a spill to start 2017, after the S&P 500 posted a surprisingly strong gain in 2016. In other corporate news, OPKO Health shares fell 18.8 percent after the company said its experimental drug for growth hormone deficiency in adults failed to provide a statistically significant benefit in a late-stage study. About 5.6 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 6.8 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.23-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.49-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 1 new 52-week high and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 58 new highs and 48 new lows.

But the organization says it is standing by the results of its battery tests and won’t be running them again. Apple’s latest laptops became the first ever MacBook Pros to miss out on Consumer Reports’ coveted rating, after it found their battery life to be wildly inconsistent. The nonprofit discovered that the runtimes of all three machines varied by more than 10 hours in three consecutive tests. The13-inch model with the Touch Bar ran for 16 hours in the first trial, 12.75 hours in the second, and just 3.75 hours in the third. The 13-inch model without the Touch Bar worked for 19.5 hours in one trial but only 4.5 hours in the next. And the numbers for the 15-inch laptop ranged from 18.5 down to 8 hours. It’s those higher figures, which are almost double what Apple says the laptops are capable of, that have caused 9to5Mac to question the validity of the tests. The publication emailed Consumer Reports’ director of electronic testing, Maria Rerecich, suggesting the experiment should be repeated, but she believes such an action is unnecessary. “In this case, we don’t believe re-running the tests are warranted for several reasons. First, as we point out in our original article, experiencing very high battery life on MacBooks is not unusual for us – in fact we had a model in our comparative tests that got 19 hours,” she replied. “Second, we confirmed our brightness with three different meters, so we feel confident in our findings using this equipment. Finally, we monitor our tests very closely. There is an entry logged every minute, so we know from these entries that the app worked correctly,” Rerecich added. The tests also prompted Apple’s VP of Marketing, Phil Schiller, to make a statement. He said the Cupertino company was working with Consumer Reports to find an explanation for the results, which apparently do not match Apple's own extensive lab and field testing. A large number of MacBook Pro owners say the new machines’ poor battery life is a major problem. A 9to5Mac reader poll found the largest group were reporting the laptops lasting five hours or less before running out of juice. Earlier this month, Apple removed the ‘time remaining’ battery life estimate in the newest version of MacOS Sierra in response to the complaints.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Master Gardeners push for 'Seed' movie screening Friday Dec 30, 2016 at 1:09 PM Dec 30, 2016 at 3:45 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — A group of individuals with a passion to keep a pure seed supply and Americans healthy is attempting to get a local movie theater to screen “Seed: The Untold Story.” The David versus Goliath documentary explores how farmers are engaged in a battle with large biotech corporations who grow genetically modified crops, and sell seeds and pesticides to farmers across the country. The Master Gardeners requested the screening of the award-winning film to be shown at 7:30 p.m. on Jan. 18 at the Apple Valley Digiplex. The group needs 100 confirmed attendees by Friday 6 for the movie to be shown. Meredith “Mo” Hergenrader, a master gardener who owns Valhalla Goat Farm in Pinon Hills, said anyone interested in health and safety should attend the special screening. Hergenrader said she’s one of many who believe the actions of many agriculture giants have led to the manipulation of nature, the reduction of the variety of food being grown and has handcuffed farmers who must buy from their big agro-brother. Producers of the movie claim some 94 percent of seed varieties have disappeared over the last century, with biotech chemical companies controlling the majority of seeds, farmers, scientists and lawyers. “Bayer is buying out Monsanto and pretty soon one company will own up to 40 percent of our seeds, which are GMO and are used in various products,” Hergenrader said. “Food safety is important and we need to be aware that the government is not protecting us from consuming unhealthy product. To them, it’s all about the bottom dollar.” According to Hergenrader, who learned about seeds from her parents who kept “a wall of shelves full of seeds” at their Nebraska home, said she won her first gardening award at age 9 from the Spanish American War Veterans group. Hergenrader claims health risks come from consuming GMO corn, soy, cotton and canola-based products. She added that the incidents of allergies “skyrocketed” in Great Britain after residents began consuming soy products. Figures released by Allergy UK estimate that 45 percent of the country's population is affected by the food allergies, with a 10-fold increase in people with food intolerances in the UK over the last two decades. Hergenrader said consumers who want to avoid GMOs should buy “100 percent organic,” and use olive, coconut, sesame, grapeseed and topical oils. She added the use of pesticides and GMO corn and soy crops have caused the death of thousands of fish in the Great Lakes area. Some 39 species and 18 subspecies have vanished from Great Lakes over the past century. By 2050, the tally could reach as high as 86 species, with an extinction rate that is about 877 times higher than normal and has accelerated in the past 20 years, according to BioScience magazine. "Biotech crops and their food products have been used worldwide for about 14 years, since the first commercial planting in 1996. Since then, more than two trillion meals containing ingredients from biotech crops have been safely consumed," reported Monsanto. In addition to the leading U.S. regulatory agencies, Monsanto said regulatory agencies in 25 different countries have independently assessed these products and concluded they are safe for human consumption and the environment. Beekeeper and teacher Dale Wilcox, owner of The Natural Honey Company, told the Daily Press the use of pesticides is one of the many reasons for bee “colony collapse disorder,” which has severely reduced the agricultural bee population over the last five years. “These GMOs also change the plant’s DNA structure, resulting in weaker bees who can’t survive smaller pest infestation, nutritional deficits or travel to various parts of the state,” Wilcox, 54, said. “It’s like a domino effect, once man puts nature out of balance, the hive is affected.” Hergenrader said she’d like to see a group of like-minded people "gather to begin a conversation" and start a seed bank in the High Desert where they can wash, dry, store and trade non-GMO seeds with each other. As for the flim, Hergenrader said people shouldn’t think the cost of a $11 movie ticket is high, but should “consider it an investment in education and their health.” For more information on the seed bank, call 760-954-7792 or search Valhalla Goat Farm on Facebook.

Violet Blue, @violetblue 12.30.16 in Security Comments 691 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Hulton Archive/Getty Images Just when we thought things couldn't get worse than 2015's security and privacy disasters, the asshole known as 2016 came along to trample and pee on any hope we had left for a hack-free, secure future. This was the year Hollywood hacking scare-fantasies like War Games started to feel uncomfortably real. Yay... This lovely year, our government used Tor exploits, the UK passed its terrible Snooper's Charter, our TSA failed at cyber, the FBI got its hacking powers expanded and the Shadow Brokers tried to sell NSA secrets. But it's the stories below that shaped this year in hacking and cybersecurity. They may have even had a hand in changing the course of history for the free world. All for nothing All it takes to get the FBI's panties in a bunch is for someone to say "no" -- and bunched they became when the agency wanted to get into an encrypted iPhone related to the San Bernardino shootings. The FBI wanted Apple to build a custom version of iOS with a backdoor. Apple said it not only wouldn't, but couldn't break the phone's encryption for the case, because it would essentially break encryption on every other iPhone. This turned into a knock-down-drag-out fight both in congressional testimony and in the press. Everyone had an opinion, and the encryption debate became a vitriolic and emotional squabble. Eventually, the FBI picked itself up, dusted itself off, and ponied up $1.3 million for an exploit that allowed it into the phone. An unhealthy diagnosis When the Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital had its files held hostage in February by malware demanding payment, the digital plague known as ransomware finally got everyone's attention. While not the first emergency service organization to fall victim to these extortion schemes, the hospital's predicament highlighted the direness of the situation. The hospital was at a standstill with its systems responsible for CT scans, documentation, lab work, pharmacy functions and electronic communications all out of commission. Staff relied on pencil and paper; it was reported that radiation and oncology were temporarily shut down. The hospital eventually paid the ransom and got its files unlocked, and no one was harmed as a result of the disruption (that we know of). Still, it demonstrated just how fragile the systems our lives depend on have become. Ocean's 15 is going to be boring The SWIFT bank heists are the stuff blockbuster films are made of. That is, if we wanted to watch George Clooney sit at a computer mashing keys for about 1,000 hours. In April, hackers swiped $81 million from Bangladesh Bank thanks to a flaw in SWIFT international banking software. A bank in Vietnam was also hit with the same technique, to the tune of $1 million. Then May saw another round of SWIFT-related bank robberies, in which hackers snatched $12 million from an Ecuadorian bank. Most of the attacks targeted Australia, Hong Kong, the UK, the Ukraine and the US, and they probably won't stop anytime soon. It's now believed a second group is targeting banks using the same methods, again using malware to cover its tracks via SWIFT. Offshoring accountability There was one big hack and dump that actually felt like it wasn't done with completely evil intentions. That was the Panama Papers leak, in which a boatload of offshore-tax-haven records was released to the public via a handful of global news organizations. The offshore money-laundering firm Mossack Fonesca provided tax-avoidance services mostly to the rich and despotic, who wanted to stay technically within the law but needed to cover their unethical tracks. The resulting scandals prompted the prime minister of Iceland and FIFA ethics-committee member Juan Pedro Damiani to resign. Former UK Prime Minister David Cameron had some fessing up to do; leaders of Sudan and Azerbaijan, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko were also named in the papers. China's government went on damage control and demanded reporting on the Papers be stopped after the family members of eight Communist Party elites were shown to have dealings with offshore companies. Leave Britney alone Throughout the year, one group managed to ruin the day of many CEOs, companies, and celebrities: social media extortionists extraordinaire OurMine. Grabbing usernames and passwords from breach dumps, finding famous names and seeing if the credentials still work isn't exactly the work of hacking masterminds. But OurMine has made headlines time and again with this very simple formula. Big names on the "hacked by OurMine" list include Katy Perry, Marvel, Mark Zuckerberg, Google's Sundar Pichai, Yahoo's Marissa Mayer, AOL's Steve Case and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. They proved that even the people who should know better reuse passwords, and companies aren't doing a good enough job at telling users to change their passwords after a breach. Though, we can note with a small amount of dark amusement that one of its recent victims is Sony ... which you'd think would know all about password and security hygiene by now. What's the opposite of security? If there was a contest for getting embarrassingly hacked and being the worst at user security, Yahoo surely became the reigning queen of 2016. In fact, they won the race to the bottom so hard this year, the company may be hanging onto the crown for years to come. When Yahoo revealed in September it had been hacked in 2014, just after its sale began to Verizon, the truth started coming out. That incident affected a jaw-dropping 500 million Yahoo users. Turns out this was only one of the intrusions Yahoo failed to tell us about, because this month it revealed that it was hacked again, in 2013. This time, it took the crown for the biggest exposure of customer records and credentials, ever -- with over 1 billion accounts coming up pwned in a years-long compromise. Yahoo always had a tough slog when it came to staying afloat, but this year we found out that it really sucked at everything. But most especially security. When your DVR is a honeypot There was only one way this year could get worse when it came to hacking, and of course, it happened. Insecure IoT devices were leveraged via the Mirai Botnet to take out about half the internet when PayPal, The New York Times, Pinterest, Spotify, Twitter and many more sites went offline in October. WikiLeaks said it was all about them, everyone blamed Russia, and IoT hackers pretty much just rolled their eyes. The attackers did all this by exploiting the stupid decisions of "smart" appliance companies who left backdoors and default passwords in things like connected cameras and DVRs. The Mirai Botnet incident was only a partial use of the gigantic implanted malware bot-army, so that's just great. It certainly served as a warning -- albeit too late -- about security neglect in manufacturing, and just how fragile our internet economy and communications really are. Like D-Day, but for drama In July, President-elect Donald Trump invited the Russians to hack us in a very specific way... and they did. So weird, right? They even went the extra mile for him by taking down his Democratic opponent with a series of hacks (and subsequent leaks, via WikiLeaks) that may have swayed the election in the bad hombre's favor. It was the world's most painful lesson in cybersecurity. John Podesta got owned through bad advice encouraging him to click a phishing link, and every US state panicked about the vulnerability and hackability of its voting machines. The result has been an ugly, rolling-downhill cyberwar with Russia, pitting the incoming president against the White House and most governmental organizations who believe Russia fucked us over -- while Trump defends the 400-lb hackers who made him look good. And not just by physical comparison.

The news comes after Flurry Analytics showed that Apple still maintains a lead in holiday activations. This isn’t the first time Apple has cut back on iPhone production as a similar event occurred this year in the January – March quarter. That cut on production was around 30%, which Nikkei Asian Review says was caused by slowing sales of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. Though production of the iPhone is set to slow down in the coming year’s first quarter, that didn’t stop Apple from being another holiday hit this year. Apple devices saw a significant lead over Samsung in terms of device activations this past holiday. Apple came in first at 55% of the total activations, with runner-up Samsung following in at 21%. According to Nikkei, the latest models “sold more sluggishly than expected” and shortages of the camera sensors on the new devices have curbed Apple’s “ability to meet demand for the phones”. Zac Hall and Benjamin Mayo postulated what 2017 will bring for Apple products, and we’ve taken a look back at everything we know about the 10th anniversary iPhone thus far.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple This Text Message Could Disable Your iOS Messages Don Reisinger Tech Media Network (Tom's Guide)December 30, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Apple's Messages app could be permanently killed at the hands of one dangerous message, according to a new report. A security researcher going by the handle vincedes3 created a vCard that contains more than 14,000 lines of code. When the vCard is sent to an unsuspecting Messages user, it causes Messages to freak out and crash repeatedly. Even after you reset your device or turn it off and back on, the trouble continues. The result? A flaw that renders Apple's iOS Messages app completely useless. The flaw, which was earlier reported on by Gizmodo, is actually a problem with iOS. Apple's Messages app doesn't have the ability to interpret exceedingly sophisticated vCards, causing the Messages app to crash. While that's not necessarily a big deal (most vCards have no more than 300 lines of code and they're handled well in iOS) Apple's app automatically tries to open the last text message for users. Therefore, it creates a loop when there's a glitch in Messages that users can't escape. While the flaw has been affecting iOS users since iOS 8, according to vincedes3, it's never been a problem, since few people are trying to send vCards with that many lines of code. However, vincedes3 said that his tool is designed to highlight the flaw and illustrate that while iOS might be a generally secure operating system, it can still fall victim to sophisticated hackers. MORE: iOS 10 Messages: All the New Features and How to Use Them In fact, the vCard flaw is the second iOS Messages exploit this year. The first, which surfaced over the summer, would have allowed hackers to kill a person's iOS device whenever they opened a TIFF image containing malicious code. Although the vCard flaw isn't easy to overcome, it can be circumvented once you find yourself in that endless loop. According to vincedes3, you can simply send a text message via Siri, which will prompt the Messages app to open that text instead of the vCard. From there, simply remove the vCard text and you should be fine. If that doesn't work for some reason, vincedes3 has also launched a "save" webpage you can click on that will stop the flaw from running amok on your device. But if anything is certain, be wary of any vCards your hilarious friends decide to send your way.

Now two more patent applications have been published, suggesting Apple is continuing to take a serious look at bringing the UI feature to future iPhone and iPad models. Related: Apple Watch Series 2 review The initial filing, revealed in July, showed how the crown could be used to control volume, resize text, take a photo or scroll through menus. A second in August demonstrated how it could be used to give iOS a 3D UI that would make it possible to switch between a cube of common apps like Mail, Safari, Phone and Calendar. However, the patents unearthed today by Patently Apple (via 9to5Mac), show how haptic feedback could be added to the Digital Crown if it were deployed on iOS devices. The filing described “an exemplary rotary input that can rotate in a rotational direction as well as be displaced in a direction orthogonal to the rotational direction.” {puyllquote}If deployed it would see to give the user the illusion of a ‘click-click-click” sensation akin to turning a rotary wheel{/pullquote}. Of course, the appearance of these patents doesn’t mean Apple is certain to take future iOS devices in this direction. It does offer an insight into Apple's thinking though and, with iOS feeling a little stale, this might be a away to freshen things up.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Electronics Why iPhone production isn’t coming to the United States Why iPhone production isn’t coming to the United States By Ryan Whitwam on December 30, 2016 at 3:01 pm Comment Apple is not the top seller of smartphones in the world — not even close. It does, however, have the vast majority of smartphone profits in the world with an estimated 90%. The margins on Apple’s hardware are so large that it can out earn OEMs that sell several times as many phones. There’s been a lot of talk about encouraging the manufacturing of electronics in the US with the incoming Trump administration, but is it even feasible to build an iPhone in the US? If Apple built them in the US, would that really create many jobs? It is estimated that the iPhone 7 costs about $400 for Apple to produce. It sells for $649 in the US. A large chunk of the cost of making the phone has to do with getting components to the factories in China’s Zhengzhou region, a historically poor area that has been built up and perfectly tuned to churn out iPhones. This extreme specialization is one reason iPhone production would be very difficult to do cheaply in the US. Analysts have pointed out that when you figure in the increased wages for a US-based assembly operation, the cost of building an iPhone might only rise by 5%. I think that’s an amount that many people would be willing to pay. However, that calculation ignores many of the logistical issues. According to the New York Times, the Foxconn facilities in Zhengzhou can produce 500,000 iPhones per day. Foxconn has gotten to this point with the help of local government grants and subsidies totaling about $1.5 billion. The company has built huge facilities and employee dorms, and the government has added in infrastructure of its own. It laid down new roads and even built an airport just a few miles away from the factory to streamline the exporting process. It’s not unheard of for municipalities in the US to offer incentives to businesses that want to expand, but nothing on this scale. Apple has a sweet deal in China that it simply wouldn’t get in the US. The next problem in moving iPhone production stateside comes in actually getting the components here. Currently, Apple has nearly 800 suppliers for iPhone components, and almost half of them are in China. The vast majority of the others are in Asian countries. The logistics of getting all those parts to the US would add great expense beyond simply paying workers more. These supply chains have been built from the ground up to serve a Chinese manufacturing machine. Let’s just say that Apple decides to build a new factory in the US to assemble iPhones, and it somehow figures out how to do it without adding too much to the cost. It might not result in as many jobs as politicians would like to think. Even in China where labor is cheap, Foxconn is beginning to use robots to replace human workers. In the US, a new factory would undoubtedly be highly automated, limiting potential employment. Building iPhones in the US might sound nice, and it makes for good political rhetoric, but it’s not a silver bullet to create jobs. Smartphones has we know them were devised with Chinese manufacturing and Asian supply chains in mind. The cost of labor is only the first hurdle that would been to be cleared. Different US policies could bring some manufacturing jobs back, but automation is one of the major reasons those jobs don’t exist anymore — and no tariff policy or homegrown manufacturing initiative can easily change that.

Photo / AP Apple wants India to offer tax concessions on iPhones that the company plans to manufacture in the country, a person with knowledge of the matter said. The company wrote to the industry ministry last month seeking lower import and manufacturing duties, the person said, asking not to be identified citing rules on speaking to the media. The concessions should continue even after the government rolls out its goods and services tax which is expected to subsume all existing tariffs, the person said. The Cupertino, California-based manufacturer of iPads and iPhones is keen to kick-start operations in the world's fastest growing phone market as growth slows in countries such as China. Apple trails rivals selling cheaper handsets in the US$2 trillion (NZ$2.8t) Indian economy and producing devices in the country could accelerate the roll out of its iconic retail stores to capture burgeoning demand in the world's second-most populated nation. Apple's path toward a bigger slice of Indian sales hasn't been smooth. Its application to open stores was rejected as it fell foul of local rules that typically require at least 30 per cent of components to be made locally before a foreign company can sell through their own outlets. Apple makes most of its products in China and doesn't currently meet that criteria. Apple's spokesman in India, and Mattu J.P. Singh, a spokeswoman at India's Commerce and Industry Ministry didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants companies to make products in the country as part of his "Make in India" policy, aimed at reaping the benefits that come from manufacturing facilities and jobs. His administration doesn't want technology companies to sell products and take advantage of its vast consumer base without making their own capital investments. The company wants to start discussions with the tax department on future liability on its India earnings, the person said. It has also sought competitive advantages compared to other economies where they are already manufacturing. While Foxconn Technology Group -- Apple's main manufacturing partner -- has expressed plans to assemble phones in the country for brands like China's Xiaomi, most iPhones are put together in China. The Taiwanese company only began making its first smartphones in India in the middle of 2015.

Others share their life stories. A wife got rid of the handgun her abusive husband waved in her face. A young man handed over a brown paper bag with a loaded pistol inside. A mother dropped off a Glock she found in her son's dresser drawer. A pedestrian came in with a firearm found hidden in Washington Park. Pastor Charlie Muller of the Victory Christian Church has been the middle man for Albany County's illegal handgun buybacks for eight years, trading more than 500 anonymously surrendered weapons for $100 each. But it's a system on uncertain legal ground. Muller doesn't have a pistol permit to possess a handgun. And, even if he did, he's holding onto illegal firearms that can't be registered on a permit. "It's a judgment call and it does more good than harm. We have an arrangement," Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple said about his and District Attorney David Soares' decision to partner with a pastor. "We're trying to get these guns off the streets," the sheriff said after picking up 26 guns from Muller Friday. Muller could technically be charged with criminal possession of a weapon, but his plan to collect and transfer the guns to law enforcement shows no "criminal intent," the sheriff said. Muller and Apple attributed the program's success to their "unique" arrangement in Albany. Elsewhere a law enforcement agency participating in a gun buyback accepts the illegal guns directly. "People trust someone in the faith-based community more than they trust law enforcement," Apple said. "I have no idea who handed these guns in." Calls from anonymous civilians who want to surrender illegal handguns come to Muller's cellphone at all hours and he said he arranges to meet with them "immediately and wherever they want." After each hand-off, Muller unloads the weapons and snaps provided gun locks on each one, Apple said. Muller locks the guns in a safe inside a vault built into his church on Quail Street, which used to be a post office. "I got to trust the guy. He's been a great partner for us," Apple said. The sheriff said Muller uses the church's money to pay for each $100 trade. Once the guns are handed over to sheriff's deputies and tested, the county reimburses the pastor using asset forfeiture money collected by the district attorney's and sheriff's offices, Apple said. Deputies check every serial number and test fire each guns for ballistic examination. So far, none of the more than 500 guns handed over in the last eight years have been traced to a crime, Apple said. The guns are then destroyed in a metal-grinding machine.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Silly as they look, AirPods are facing increased demand from consumers who want to buy Apple’s latest gadget. The headphones went on sale just before Christmas but sold out within an hour. Shipping times are now pushed back into February. As a result, Apple’s suppliers are working around the clock to boost production. DigiTimes cited a report from China’s Economic Daily News on Friday, noting that Apple’s supplier Inventec is “working overtime to deliver orders” placed for Apple’s AirPods. The report said Inventec is also “expanding capacity,” which should allow it to create even more AirPods. AirPods quality control should be a focus, too This doesn’t mean that your order will ship any sooner but it should help Apple have enough stock in the coming months that new orders won’t be delayed as long. Apple should be focused on quality control as well, however, because reports are already starting to surface that suggest the AirPod travel case doesn’t actually provide as much battery life as advertised. Maybe Apple should fix that before it sends production into overtime.

The Surface Studio is selling better than expected, according to Digitimes, but it's still very far from being a mass-market product. However, it could have other benefits for both Microsoft and the PC industry... By Jack Schofield for Jack's Blog | December 30, 2016 -- 08:30 GMT (00:30 PST) | Topic: Microsoft Microsoft's Surface Studio offers a new angle on the desktop PC Image: Microsoft Microsoft's high-priced Surface Studio may be selling better than expected, if we can believe a recent report from Digitimes. The Taiwanese company - which publishes a Chinese daily newspaper on IT and high-tech supply chains - reports that "Microsoft has ordered 30,000 units to be shipped in the first quarter of 2017, according to Taiwan-based supply chain makers." Original estimates suggested that only 15,000 units would be shipped this quarter, because the Surface Studio costs so much more than alternative all-in-one PCs. The three models cost $2,999, $3,499 and $4,199. Assuming the average buyer spends $3,400, the retail value of 30,000 Surface Studios would be $100 million. If Microsoft could sell 100,000 a year, sales would be worth $0.34 billion. But this would still be a drop in the bucket. The news item says: "Apple ships about 3.5-4 million all-in-one PCs a year and is the second-largest all-in-one PC vendor worldwide behind Lenovo, according to Digitimes Research." If so, Apple could be shipping around 40 iMacs for every Surface Studio. We also don't know what sort of people are buying Surface Studios. If Microsoft is lucky, most of them will be the creative types at whom the product is aimed. But Microsoft has around 114,074 staff - that's the official number for June 30, 2016 - and a lot of them could be tempted. Some Surface Studios could even end up on their office desks, at Microsoft's expense. But it doesn't really matter. The Surface Studio is obviously a high-end product, not one designed for the mass market. If Microsoft aimed for the mainstream, it would be competing with its own partners, and I don't expect the major ones - HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus, Acer etc - would like that. The Surface Studio is doing other things, regardless of how many it sells. First, it's competing directly against Apple in the image wars, rather than the sales wars. Microsoft never wants to hear anyone say that the best PC for running Windows is a Mac. I think it would enjoy hearing that the best PC for running Windows is a Microsoft Surface, whether or not people actually buy them. You may remember that the Surface Studio has already scored a major victory in the image wars, because Microsoft's launch generated lots of praise on social media and in the press for its innovation and style. One day later, Apple was widely criticised for its lacklustre MacBook Pro launch, and for failing to even mention its moribund desktop products. The idea that "Microsoft is the new Apple" is a potent one. Second, Microsoft's research is feeding innovation into a PC industry that is struggling in a declining market. The Surface Pro range has already prompted several knock-offs, including Apple's iPad Pro. Even if nobody clones the Surface Studio directly, it will give other PC designers new things to think about. Third, Microsoft's Surface range should help to improve Windows 10. Until recently, Windows software was developed without much first-hand experience of the hardware design problems, whereas Apple benefited from the close integration of hardware and software. We can but hope that the future development of Surface and Windows 10 will produce similar benefits. Microsoft still makes most of its income by selling through partners, so competing with partners is a dangerous game. However, in this case, there are some benefits. And if the OEMs can see that Microsoft is targeting Apple rather than them, they'll probably live with that.

In subdued holiday trading, the S&P 500 was on pace for its third consecutive session of losses. But the benchmark index was still on track for an annual gain of more than 9 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed more than 13 percent for 2016, but was also on pace to post its first weekly decline since the U.S. election on Nov. 8. Stocks have stalled this week after surging in the wake of Donald Trump's presidential election. Investors have bet Trump will cut taxes and regulations and introduce fresh economic stimulus. "It's been such a significant run-up that there's been a pause," said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. "We are to the point now where there's uncertainty with regard to what policies are implemented, when are they implemented and how are they going to affect the economy as a whole and industries specifically." The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 55.22 points, or 0.28 percent, to 19,764.56, the S&P 500 lost 10.5 points, or 0.47 percent, to 2,238.76 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 51.17 points, or 0.94 percent, to 5,380.92. The Dow slipped further from the 20,000 milestone, after coming within 13 points of the mark but not yet breaching it. Apple shares fell 0.9 percent after a report that the company will trim iPhone production. The stock was one of the biggest drags on major indexes, while shares of Apple suppliers such as Cirrus Logic and Qualcomm also were lower. Tech was the worst-performing major S&P sector, falling 1 percent. Big tech companies such as Microsoft and Alphabet slumped more than 1 percent. Investors are wary that the market could be primed for a spill to start 2017, after the S&P 500 posted a surprisingly strong gain in 2016. In other corporate news, OPKO Health shares fell 19.9 percent after the company said its experimental drug for growth hormone deficiency in adults failed to provide a statistically significant benefit in a late-stage study. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.80-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 1 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 40 new highs and 43 new lows.

NEW DELHI: Apple may well be planning to make iPhones in India through the contract manufacturing route, initially partnering with Wistron, with industry insiders saying the Cupertino-based smartphone maker can begin with accessories and repairs before taking the bigger plunge. Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron is setting up a plant in an industrial area near Bengaluru, two people aware of the developments said, adding that a timeline for undertaking the task has not been decided. "Wistron is setting up a plant exclusively for Apple," one of them said, requesting anonymity. While Apple declined to comment, Taipei-headquartered Wistron said, "We are unable to make any comments on our clients and products currently," when asked specifically about Apple’s plans to make in India. Wistron is one of the global contract manufacturers and was hired by Apple in 2016. The company reportedly assembles iPhones at three plants in China. Industry insiders say that while assembly of phones may begin with Wistron, Apple could look at taking the manufacturing to deeper levels in the coming years, with larger players like Foxconn or Pegatron. Foxconn is Apple’s largest supplier of iPhones. Analysts say that while taking the step of assembling iPhones can be done with present set of duties and incentives being offered by the government, full scale manufacturing is still a few years away. "The question in Apple's case is what level of manufacturing it wants to do in India… some high-end phones are already being made in India, but Apple's level of manufacturing is way above what local vendors are doing here," said Jaipal Singh, senior analyst at IDC India. Manufacturing in India may enable Apple to sell phones in India that cost 10 per cent less than those imported – at upwards of Rs 50,000 a pop, the cost saving is a very attractive proposition. But experts point to the fact that local level manufacturing is still in the nascent stages of assembly, which will continue for the next two to three years. There is also the element of lack of supporting ecosystem, as all parts are imported from China and put together in India. The other issue is of the demand and whether Apple will have enough volumes for assembling locally. "Majority of the Indian market is less than $200, so the most pertinent question is that how much is Apple willing to invest for just 15 per cent of the market?" Singh added. Apple has shipped a record around 2.5 million iPhones from October 2015 to September 2016, up 56 per cent on year, according to Counterpoint Research. The annual volume is far lower than the average monthly sale of a local smartphone maker in India. Despite the low volumes, India has been on Apple's radar in 2016, more so after CEO Tim Cook spent nearly a week here in May.

Nikkei sources say Apple will make one less iPhone for every 10 between January and March, amid reports of slowing demand for the flagship models. Related: iPhone 7 review - not up to Apple's high standards The report says: “Apple will trim production of its iPhone family around 10% on the year in the first quarter of 2017, according to calculations by The Nikkei based on data from suppliers. ...the phones still have sold more sluggishly than expected. Information on production of the latest models and global sales suggests cuts in both the 7 and 7 Plus lines in the coming quarter.” Many of the firm’s loyal customers are believed to be swerving the modest update served up in September. The iPhone 8 (or 7s or whatever Apple ends up calling it) will bring a much larger design overhaul, if reports are to be believed. The iPhone 8 is believed to offer a flexible OLED display with a bezel-free design and an all-glass casing. Today’s report follows purported insight from the analysts at NPD, who claimed the iPhone 7 lacked enough “compelling features” to fully capitalise on Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 disaster.

The iPhone 7 was released without a headphone jack, an unpopular choice that's now been somewhat ameliorated by the launch of the AirPods, and the MacBook Pro has been plagued by battery issues, graphics problems, and complaints about the high price of the device. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. Apple also saw its first decline in iPhone sales in 2016, but 2017 could potentially turn things around for the company. We're expecting the biggest iPhone revision we've seen since the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launched in 2014, plus we're also expecting major iPad changes, refreshed desktop Macs, and software improvements. iPhone 8 - September 2017 Rumors about the 2017 iPhone started ramping up before the iPhone 7 was even released, so there's a lot of information out there, and at this point, quite a bit of it conflicts, so it's difficult to get a clear picture of what Apple is planning for the iPhone's 10th anniversary. If you read all of the rumors and suss out some common themes, there are a few concrete details that hint at what likely to see in the next-generation iPhone. We're assuming it's going to be called the "iPhone 8" due to design changes that are more radical than we'd expect for an "iPhone 7s," but it's entirely possible Apple will go with another name. It looks like there's going to be at least three iPhone models, and one of those will have an OLED display. It's sounding like we're going to get one premium OLED iPhone somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 inches, with either a flexible curved display that wraps around the edges like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge or an edge-to-edge display more in line with the current design of the iPhone 7. These seem to be mutually exclusive concepts, but we've heard rumors suggesting both possibilities. A display that wraps around the sides of the phone seems to suggest we'd continue to have some kind of top and bottom bezels, but information coming from sources like KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo seems to point more towards a less curved 2.5D edge-to-edge display that does away with bezels entirely. Edge-to-edge iPhone concept image via ConceptsiPhone Of course, it's possible some "edge-to-edge" rumors refer to the removal of the side bezels rather than the top and bottom bezels, but it's not entirely clear. Either way, it seems the iPhone 8 will do away with the Home button, incorporating a Touch ID fingerprint scanner directly into the display. Ambient light sensors, microphone, and camera may also be located under the display for a true single piece of glass look. Along with that OLED model, rumors also suggest we're going to get two other iPhone models, perhaps in standard 4.7 and 5.5-inch configurations. These would presumably be less expensive and would use easier to obtain standard LCD display panels. Either the OLED model or all three iPhone models rumored for 2017 will include a glass body, doing away with the aluminum-style body that Apple has used for several years in a row. The glass back and the display may be housed in an aluminum frame for stability, but the glass itself will mean a significantly different visual aesthetic. A glass body will bring a fresh look, but there's another reason behind the materials switch -- wireless charging. Apple is rumored to be developing long-range wireless charging techniques, which could make their debut in 2017. An aluminum body can interfere with wireless charging speeds, while a glass body offers less interference. It's not entirely clear if Apple is developing its own wireless charging solution or working with a company like Energous, nor do we know exactly how wireless charging will be implemented, but it is looking like a feature we can expect to see in all 2017 iPhone models. Other features rumored for the 2017 iPhone include a faster A11 processor, more advanced biometric features like improved facial recognition techniques or perhaps even iris scanning, and an upgraded Taptic Engine able to create "more complex tactile vibrations." Dual cameras are expected to be offered in some iPhone models, but optical image stabilization could be added to both lenses (instead of just the wide-angle lens) in the next-generation iPhone. Apple is rumored to be considering upwards of 10 different prototypes for the 2017 iPhone, which explains why we may be hearing so many different rumors about the device at this point in time. As we get closer to the September launch date of the 2017 iPhone and as Apple's own plans solidify, we'll get a better idea of what to expect. Read full iPhone 8 roundup iPad Pro - Spring 2017? Apple is working on a revamped version of the iPad Pro, and as with the iPhone, the rumors are all over the place. Apple is said to be planning on introducing three models in 2017: a 9.7-inch iPad Pro, a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and a new mid-range model with a display that's somewhere between 10.1 and 10.9 inches. The 10-inch iPad Pro is rumored to feature an edge-to-edge nearly bezel-free display much like the iPhone 8, and its actual body size will be identical to the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. For that reason, rumors suggest the 10-inch iPad Pro will be replacing the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, but Apple plans to keep the 9.7-inch iPad Pro around as a low-cost tablet option. The 10-inch and 12.9-inch models will reportedly be the new flagship models, upgraded with faster A10X processors. The exact size of the 10-inch iPad hasn't been sussed out yet. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who often reliably predicts Apple's plans, says it will measure in at 10.5-inches. Japanese site Mac Otakara has a more mixed track record and has released two reports pointing towards both 10.9 and 10.1 inches. Rumors out of the Taiwanese supply chain have suggested 10.5 inches, and research conducted by Barclays Research says it'll be 10.9 inches. One rumor from Mac Otakara also suggests Apple will introduce a smaller 7.9-inch iPad Pro to succeed the iPad mini, but that information has not yet been confirmed by another source. With Apple planning to introduce new iPads in 2017, there may also be more of a focus on iPad-specific software during the year. Apple is said to be aiming to enhance the iPad Pro with new hardware and software features that cater specifically to professional users, such as a faster display for smoother on-screen zooming, panning, and scrolling, and expanded iOS support for the Apple Pencil that will allow it to work in more areas. Mac Otakara and Barclays Research have both predicted an early 2017 launch for the new iPads, perhaps in March or April, but if a radical edge-to-edge redesign is in the works, it is questionable as to whether Apple will upstage the 2017 iPhone 8 that's expected in September with an edge-to-edge iPad launching earlier in the year. Read full iPad Pro roundup iMac - Spring 2017 New iMacs didn't debut alongside the MacBook Pro at Apple's October 2016 event, but there's rumored to be an update in the works. According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, we will see iMacs in "mid-1H17," which translates to sometime around March or April. A refreshed iMac will likely include Intel's Kaby Lake chips and AMD graphics (in models that use discrete graphics options). The iMac is potentially due for a design refresh, but there have been no rumors suggesting anything more than a minor spec update is on the horizon. In fact, information from Bloomberg suggests all we'll see in a 2017 is a shift to USB-C and improved processors. Kaby Lake chips appropriate for the iMac are set to come out in late December to early January, perfect timing for a spring release. We could potentially see a new keyboard that could ship alongside an iMac. Apple is rumored to be considering a standalone keyboard that incorporates a Touch Bar much like the keyboard of the MacBook Pro. Such a product might accompany a future iMac. Read full iMac roundup MacBook - Spring 2017 After introducing the 12-inch Retina MacBook in the spring of 2015, Apple launched a refreshed version in the spring of 2016, so it stands to reason we'll see yet another upgrade in the early months of 2017. Low-power Kaby Lake chips appropriate for the MacBook are already available, so that's a safe bet for what we might see in an upgraded machine. No design changes are expected. Read full MacBook roundup MacBook Pro - Fall 2017 New MacBook Pro models with a Touch Bar came out in 2016, and if Apple sticks to a traditional upgrade cycle, we'll see a refresh with upgraded internal components in the fall of 2017. Upgrades could include Kaby Lake processors and slight price cuts, but no external design changes are expected for the next several years. Read full MacBook Pro roundup Mac Pro The Mac Pro is overdue for an update, having last been updated in 2013, and we don't know when it's going to get a refresh. There are no concrete rumors suggesting an update is in the works, and no hints on what a new machine might include. Processors and graphics cards appropriate for an updated machine have long been available, but Apple could be waiting for the latest technology from companies like Intel and AMD before presenting a new Mac Pro. If a Mac Pro is planned for 2017, it could come in the spring alongside refreshed iMacs or, if Apple is waiting for cutting-edge current-generation chips, it could come in the fall. Read full Mac Pro roundup Mac mini Like the Mac Pro, the Mac mini has not seen an update for multiple years, with the last update coming in October 2014. Unfortunately, we've heard no rumors on whether or not we can expect to see an upgraded Mac mini in 2016, but if it does come, it could include Kaby Lake chips, faster SSD options, better graphics, and other improvements that have been brought to the Mac lineup over the last two years. Read full Mac mini roundup MacBook Air - Never With thinner, lighter MacBook and MacBook Pro machines now available, we don't expect to see another MacBook Air update. Apple will likely keep the MacBook Air around for a while as a low-cost option until it's able to cut the price on more expensive machines, but a new MacBook Air probably isn't going to happen. We could, however, potentially see small spec boosts and minor internal upgrades if Apple wants to keep its low-cost machine relevant for a longer period of time. Read full MacBook Air roundup Apple Watch - Fall 2017? If Apple is working on a third-generation Apple Watch for the fall of 2017, it's being kept tightly under wraps. We haven't heard any rumors suggesting a new Apple Watch is in the works for 2017, but if we are going to get one, it could come in the fall alongside the iPhone 8. Potential features we could see in a new Apple Watch include the first significant design changes, upgraded processors, and perhaps sensors that Apple was not able to build into the first and second-generation versions. Cellular connectivity, a feature Apple has wanted to incorporate into the watch but hasn't been able to add due to battery life concerns, could also come in a 2017 model. We've also heard rumors of a potential switch to micro-LED displays for the Apple Watch, which can be thinner and lighter with improved color gamut and brightness. At this point, it's too early to tell if we're going to get a new Apple Watch in 2017, so we'll need to wait for additional rumors to surface over the first few months of the year to figure out what's going on with Apple's wearable. Read full Apple Watch roundup Apple TV - Unknown While it's possible Apple could introduce an Apple TV update in 2017, we don't think it's likely to happen. There are no recent rumors suggesting an update is in the works, and there's no real reason for the Apple TV to be updated. Prior to the introduction of the fourth-generation Apple TV, Apple went several years without introducing a new version of the device, so historically, it is not on an every-year or every-other-year update schedule like Macs and iOS devices. That said, rumors suggest a future Apple TV could include a better processor and perhaps some features that would allow it to compete with products like the Amazon Echo and the Google Home, but there are other rumors that make it unclear whether these are features that would go into an Apple TV or another standalone product also rumored to be under development in Cupertino -- a home hub. Read full Apple TV roundup Home Hub - Late 2017? Rumors suggest Apple is working on a connected smart home device that's similar to the Amazon Echo. It would be equipped with a speaker and microphone and powered by Apple's Siri voice assistant. The hub, which has been in development for two years and is in the prototype testing phase, is said to be able to control HomeKit-connected accessories like lights, locks, window shades, and more through voice activation. It may feature "more advanced microphone and speaker technology" than the Amazon Echo or the Google Home, products it will compete with. The Amazon Echo Information on the hub is a bit nebulous at this point, and it's not clear if it's going to be a new standalone speaker-only product or something in the AirPort or Apple TV families, both of which are possibilities. Facial recognition capabilities may be built into the device, and Apple is also working on Siri advancements that will allow it to do more. Because the hub is still in the prototyping phase, it's not entirely clear when it will launch. It could come in the later months of 2017, but it may not be ready until 2018. Apple could also scrap the project entirely. iOS 11 - Fall 2017 (June Preview) Apple introduces a new version of its mobile operating system for iPhones and iPads on a yearly basis, and in 2017, we're expecting to see iOS 11. There aren't many details on what will be included in iOS 11, but we've heard some hints suggesting there could be more of a focus on the iPad, with features like improved Apple Pencil support that cater to professional users. Apple is said to be planning on allowing the Apple Pencil to work more widely across the operating system. Apple is also rumored to be developing its own social networking app to compete with Snapchat and Facebook, allowing users to record video, edit video, and add filter and doodles. Such an app, if development continues, could debut alongside iOS 11. Apple has also been exploring augmented and virtual reality with a dedicated AR/VR team, and some kind of augmented reality feature could potentially be introduced in iOS 11. Maps and Photos are two areas where Apple could take advantage of augmented reality with the iPhone's camera, offering features like mapping overlays of real-world views or Snapchat-style photo filters. macOS 10.13 - Fall 2017 (June Preview) The next-generation version of macOS (10.13) will come in the fall of 2017, introducing new features and refining the macOS operating system. There's no word yet on what features we might see in macOS 10.13, but details will likely leak out as it gets later in the year. Apple will preview macOS 10.13 at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, which typically takes place in June. watchOS 4 - Fall 2017 (June Preview) Alongside iOS 10.11, we're likely going to get watchOS 4, an updated version of the operating system that runs on the Apple Watch. There's no word yet on what new features could be included in watchOS 4, but we'll get our first glimpse of the new software in June. tvOS 11 - Fall 2017 (June Preview) The final software update we're expecting in 2017 is tvOS 11, a new version of the tvOS software that runs on the fourth-generation TV. Apple is still working to refine the tvOS experience, so we can likely expect to see some interface improvements and other usability changes as the company gets a better handle on how people are using their set-top boxes. tvOS 11, along with macOS 10.13, watchOS 4, and iOS 10.11, will be previewed at WWDC ahead of a fall launch.

I'll still rock their phones but when it comes to my next laptop, it's getting harder to root for Apple with competition heating up. With them dropping their Airport routers just gives me another reason to look elsewhere. I'm not into Apple jewelry or gimmicks to be honest. Rating: 37 Votes radiology 3 days ago at 11:58 am This is going to be the best year in the history of the company. The products Apple will realease are just unbelievable. They will blow people's mind. You will see the the widest range of colors in the entire tech industry. There will be new watch bands that will make YSL envy. Needless to say, all the products will be thinner and thinner as unnecessary ports are removed from the devices. The new emoji collection will have the most comprehensive ethnicity ever created. The number of online orders for each product category will be the largest in Apple's history and will outpace the competition by many folds. The company will continue to make efforts to improve safety and privacy. On top of that, they will continue to make sure we live in a better planet. For all that, I thank you Tim, for ruining Apple computers. Happy 2017, everyone! Rating: 31 Votes Cineplex 3 days ago at 11:56 am What to expect from Apple in 2017? One word. Disappointment! Rating: 26 Votes Mascots 3 days ago at 11:08 am Refreshed Macs? I wouldn't hold my breath these days :( I'll be blue by next November Rating: 23 Votes Altivec88 3 days ago at 08:57 pm When I look at what Apple is doing in its entirety, I see a company who is slowly but surely gravitating towards what they believe will be the next big thing. The things we are criticizing Apple for, I feel they are simply growing pains as Apple prepares to leave older markets behind and enter new ones. And I feel we need to be understanding in this area. . As an enterprise customer that has built their entire business on Apple products the past 30+ years, We do not have the luxury of being understanding in this area. Unfortunately, for us pro's, "the next best thing" doesn't put food on our plate. For the time being we must rely on those old things called computers. The point of paying a premium for Apple products is the problem free (well less problem free lately) ecosystem between all products. From our iPhones and iPads, to our Mac mini servers and airport routers, right down to our work horse MacPro's. Allowing us to concentrate on our work rather than the technology more than makes up for the extra costs we pay Apple. The problem is we've been waiting 6 years to update our aging and dying 12 core 2010 MacPro's. We purchased one 2013 MacPro to try out and there was virtually no improvement in rendering speeds, yet they were double the price of our 2010 models. So month by month we kept waiting for a speed bump. Both Dell and HP have updated their workstations twice since 2013 and currently offer 44 core systems. When Apple announced their Mac Event at the end of 2016, we were sure a Mac Pro update was imminent. Nope, not even a mention... That silence was deafening to us and triggered a stop order on all future purchases of any Apple product. We use iPhones and iPads to automatically sync notes and photos to our pro machines. If we have to switch our Mac Pro's to Dell or HP workstations, we have no reason to buy Macbook Pros, iMacs, iPads or iPhones. We will be switching those to surface's and window phones for easier integration and lower cost. I know, windows sucks and we don't want to leave, but as other pointed out, Apple is pushing us out the door by neglecting us. So I get that consumers who are okay with outdated tech and slow updates get upset at seeing all the negativity. Trust me, I use to be a die hard fan boy too. But when your PC using competition is blowing you out of the water because their tech is far far superior to yours and it starts costing you big dollars, you would show a little displeasure too. 2017 is the year that things better start popping out this long dragged out pipeline or I really won't care any more. More specifically, no Mac Pro by March and you can put a fork in it. Thanks Tim for ruining Apple. Rating: 21 Votes tech4all 3 days ago at 02:26 pm Hope we get less whiners/trolls/trolling posts next year! If Apple delivers satisfactory products, then people will stop stating their dissatisfaction, or "whining" and "trolling" as some call it. Rating: 21 Votes gertruded 3 days ago at 12:24 pm We are Apple users since our first Apple 2 plus through iPhone 6splus, we are finally through. Our 2007 iMac, our 2009 mini, and our 2012 air are all aging and need replacement soon. We purchased a Windows machine for Christmas and it seems to be OK. Apple is clearly abandoning their Mac line. The difficult conversion of files has begun. Apple left us, not the other way around. Rating: 20 Votes BreadofWonder 3 days ago at 11:13 am No reason to update the Apple TV? Really? I can think of two really good ones: 4K and HDR. Every other streamer has it at this point and I'd be shocked if Apple doesn't do it too before the end of the year.

Video provided by TheStreet Newslook There’s a lot more you can do with your new iPhone than simply take photos, listen to music and make calls. (Photo: Apple) Apple will reportedly cut production of the iPhone during the 2017 first quarter as sales of its latest smartphone are slower than expected. According to Nikkei Asian Review, Apple will trim production by 10% based on data from suppliers. The additional cuts arrive despite Apple performing a similar cut last year for the iPhone 6s. The report also says Apple's iPhone 7 Plus remains popular, but the company can't meet demand because of a shortage in camera sensors. Apple declined to comment on the report. Shares of Apple were down nearly 1% in afternoon trading Friday. Apple has hinted throughout the year sales of its iPhone would decline. Fiscal year revenue for 2016 dropped for the first time in fifteen years. Meanwhile, fourth quarter iPhone shipments were down 5% from the same time last year. Next month, Apple is expected to report first quarter results, which will break down sales of Apple devices during the important holiday season.

That’s good news for impatient consumers who are currently waiting upwards of six weeks for theirs to arrive. Inventec ramps up AirPods production to help meet demand News of the production increase comes via DigiTimes from the Chinese-language Economic Daily News. EDN reports Inventec also has staff working overtime to help meet Apple’s demand. Apple introduced the AirPods wireless earbuds in September at its iPhone 7 launch event. AirPods connect through Bluetooth, and once paired with one of your devices they automatically work with others linked to your iCloud account. AirPods were supposed to ship in October, but were delayed until late December. Apple began taking preorders on December 13th, but excitement quickly led to frustration when shipping times were pushed out to four weeks within an hour. That delay stretched out to six weeks in short order, and hasn’t changed. Inventec’s efforts may already be paying off because some AirPods buyers are getting their delivery earlier than expected. If you’re hoping to get AirPods earlier, Apple’s stores are getting very limited stock.

And there's much more chaos and innovation to come. [Photo: Flickr user Steven Depolo] John Paul Titlow 12.30.16 2:00 PM Last year was another eventful one in the history of music. And that was no surprise. In 2016, the music industry saw its first signs of true growth since the internet started ravaging it a decade and a half ago. By mid-year, labels saw revenue grow 8.1% over the same period in 2015, fueled mostly by an explosion in subscribers flocking to services like Spotify (40 million subscribers) and Apple Music (20 million). Indeed, in early 2016, we learned that streaming had officially become the industry’s biggest source of income in 2015. While revenue from downloads and physical album sales both continued their years-long decline (by 14% and 17%, respectively), streaming revenue grew 57% during the first half of 2016, and since then, all signs have pointed to continued growth. This is good news for record execs, but what it means for artists and streaming platforms—which each have their own contractual relationships with labels—remains to be seen. As the pie grows, expect to see intensified battles over how it all gets divvied up. 5 Ways Streaming Music Will Change In 2016 2015 was a transformative year for online music. So what's next? There were also big changes within the streaming landscape itself. Amazon and SoundCloud launched Spotify competitors. Apple polished up its existing service with a new interface. Pandora also unveiled its premium subscription service, expected to launch in the first quarter of 2017. For those keeping count at home, that’s three new subscription services in one year, on top of the three that launched the year before (Tidal, Apple Music, and YouTube Red). Despite all the new competition, Spotify has held onto its dominant role, growing its listenership and flexing its playlisting muscle with more in-house curation and data-powered personalized playlists like Discover Weekly, Release Radar, and Your Daily Mix. Despite all the upward-sloping numbers, the music industry still found reason to gripe. Its chief target this year was YouTube, which, along with Spotify’s free tier, creates what the RIAA calls a "value gap" for the industry. Simply put, ad-supported services just don’t make as much money as music subscriptions. Indeed, vinyl sales—a relatively tiny sliver of the industry’s income—generated more money than ad-supported streaming like YouTube, SoundCloud, and Spotify’s free tier. There was tension elsewhere as well. Frank Ocean pulled a fast one on his label Def Jam by releasing his short visual album Endless on Apple Music to fulfill his contract before self-releasing the blockbuster Blond and denying Def Jam a cut of the profits. The maneuver made record executives rethink the already-controversial practice of releasing albums by major artists exclusively on one platform, which may help drive subscription numbers, but frustrates fans and encourages piracy. Up until that point, big-name exclusives practically defined the year in popular music: Kanye West, Drake, Beyoncé, and Chance the Rapper all put out albums initially available only via either Apple Music or Tidal. (Spotify refuses to play this game.) Meanwhile, the concept of the album itself became ever more fuzzy, thanks to visual albums (i.e., music released as a long-form video or film) from Ocean and Beyoncé, plus Kanye West’s post-release editing of Life of Pablo. With so much change in the last few years, what could 2017 possibly hold? Plenty. Here are our predictions. The Music Subscription Boom Will Continue The number of people willing to pay $10 a month for music skyrocketed in 2016, but it’s still pretty small. All told, about 100 million people are believed to subscribe to music services. (This doesn’t include free streaming from SoundCloud, YouTube, or Spotify’s free tier.) But considering that there are 319 million people in the United States alone, there’s plenty of room for growth. Just look at Apple Music. The service, which is available in 113 countries and comes pre-installed on every iOS device, only took a year and a half to reach half of Spotify’s size in terms of paying subscribers. And they both keep expanding. Now we have Amazon Music Unlimited, which is well positioned to reel in new subscribers at $8 per month for Prime members. When Pandora finally launches its subscription service, it will have 78 million listeners to potentially convert into paying subscribers—not to mention a newfound possibility of expansion beyond the U.S., New Zealand, and Australia (although those plans are still being hammered out). Streaming music is also breaking free from the confines of our smartphones and laptops. Thanks to the rise of smart speakers like Amazon Echo, Sonos, and Google Home, more listening is happening at home, making the prospect of treating music like a monthly utility an even more sensible one. Cheaper family subscription plans don't hurt, either. At Least One Music Service Will Disappear We’ve seen five new music subscription services arrive in the last two years (and one more coming from Pandora early next year), but that doesn’t mean music streaming has become a lucrative successful business. Quite the opposite: None of these services has made an enduring profit, although Spotify is working aggressively toward that goal as it gets ready to go public next year. Big tech companies like Apple, Google, and Amazon can afford to run their music services at a loss indefinitely. This landscape makes it tricky for smaller players like Tidal, SoundCloud, Deezer, and Napster (formerly Rhapsody). Both Tidal and SoundCloud were the subject of acquisition rumors in 2016, and rumors continue to swirl around the prospect of Pandora selling itself off. Bandcamp would make a very attractive acquisition for Pandora or Spotify, but the artist-centric music and merch marketplace is well positioned to stay independent if it prefers: The company has been profitable since 2012 and its cultural influence is only growing. The bottom line: Expect to see fewer music services this time next year. At least one of these companies is bound to get acquired or go under altogether. Streaming eExclusives Won’t Die Frank Ocean may have put a damper on the industry’s enthusiasm about platform-exclusive album releases, but don’t expect to see the trend die off just yet. Universal (owner of Def Jam) may have sworn them off, but the other major labels have remained silent on the issue. Besides, in an age when many artists have an unprecedented capacity to chart their own course, does it really matter what the labels think? Apple and Tidal are apparently willing to shell out a ton of money for these exclusive deals. And as long as they remain an effective tool for driving subscriptions amid intensifying competition, the streaming platforms aren’t likely to stop offering them. Despite some controversy, the exclusivity approach seems to work for most artists: Drake was the most-streamed artist on Spotify this year, despite Views only being available on Apple Music when it debuted. Like Beyoncé’s Lemonade and Ocean’s Blond, Drake’s latest album was a massive success overall. That said, we should expect to see fewer of these deals next year. Streaming platforms, labels, and artists will use the tactic much more selectively to minimize fallout while still extracting whatever competitive value they can. Musicians Will Squirm As AI Gets Better At Making Music Have you ever seen a computer write a song? It’s nuts. Give IBM’s Watson a simple melody and define a mood, and the multi-talented artificial intelligence platform will churn out an original song that sounds like it was made by a person—albeit not an especially talented one. But it’s now possible to teach machines enough about the rules of music theory to let them compose their own music, complete with multiple instrumental layers and changes in key and tempo. The result isn’t something you’ll want to listen to on your daily commute, but it’s still early in the quest to teach computers how to make art. And it’s not just IBM that’s focused on this. Google’s Magenta project, announced in April 2016, is in the beginning stages of stretching the limits of machine learning to help computers understand—and eventually mimic—creative thinking. Like Watson, Magenta has already produced a rudimentary song of its own. Machines aren’t about to put artists out of work, but advances in artificial intelligence could make certain types of music easier and cheaper to create—video-game soundtracks or background music for a retail store, for instance—that would not require licensing or paying royalties. AI could also augment the creative process for flesh-and-blood songwriters. An artist stuck on writing the chorus of a song could tap into tools based on Watson or Magenta to auto-generate a few ideas. Next year, expect the technology to improve slightly and for more artists to catch wind of it. Some will see an exciting new creative opportunity. Others will cringe at the mere idea of it. New Answers (And Dollar Signs) For Artists The brief history of streaming’s rise has been accompanied by an often awkward question: How will artists fare? It’s a natural concern given the minuscule per-stream royalty rates offered under a model that’s still scaling to its full potential. There won’t be a silver bullet in 2017, but artists will see more reasons to be hopeful about the future because catering to artists has increasingly become a priority for streaming services. Apple Music and Tidal have famously made artist-friendliness a key tenet of their offerings—or at least of their marketing. In June 2016, Spotify hired former Lady Gaga manager Troy Carter to oversee its expanding artist relations initiatives. Middle-class artists might not be getting huge checks from Spotify, but many are finding new promotional value in landing on the service’s most popular playlists, whether they be hand-curated in-house or data-powered. Discover Weekly alone drove more than half of all listening for 8,000 artists in less than a year. Spotify is also building out more tools and services for artists and finding ways to tap into the passion—and disposable income—of super-fans. Meanwhile, Pandora is busy reshaping itself into a service that caters more directly to artists’ needs, be it with data, marketing tools for artists, or the ability to sell concert tickets directly to fans from within the app. Spotify's Discover Weekly Has 40 Million Listeners—More Than Apple Music And Tidal Not even a year after launch, the playlist is boasting some big, impressive numbers. For now, record labels still reap the lion’s share of revenue, but that balance of power is poised to shift. Between the platforms' investment in artist relations and the growing slice of revenue being generated by streaming, musicians are bound to see new benefits. And streaming services, labels, and artists will all have to renegotiate their relationships with one another. Artists may soon be in a better position to demand more from their labels or, following Frank Ocean’s lead, sidestep the middlemen altogether—a prospect that could become easier for less-than-household names as the streaming industry’s artist-facing services mature. We’re also seeing promising signs outside of the all-you-can-stream model. In 2015, Bandcamp announced that it had paid out $100 million to artists since being founded in 2008. As 2016 winds down, that number is already up to $190 million, a number that suggests Bandcamp is booming. That’s not just good news for Bandcamp and the artists who use it to sell music and merchandise. It’s also a clear sign that music fans are perfectly happy to pay for music and support artists directly in the digital age. Amazon Will Become A Major Player In Music In 2016, the streaming battle was primarily framed as a competitive struggle between Apple and Spotify. That will continue in 2017, but while latecomers to the subscription game like Pandora and SoundCloud fight to amass bigger numbers, one company will have a relatively easy time: Amazon. Like Apple, Amazon has the advantage of being a giant tech company with a massive customer base to which it can market its music service. Its wildly successful Echo smart speaker is also a natural vehicle for a full-fledged music subscription service, and Alexa offers more voice control functionality to Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers than it does to users of other services like Spotify and Pandora. Hands On With Amazon’s Spotify Competitor: A Bare-Bones Service, But Still A Threat It may lack sophistication, but the new Amazon Unlimited Music has convenience and price going for it. And that should win it some fans. It's also a cheaper option for many people: If you subscribe to Amazon Prime, Amazon’s music service is $8 per month. If you own an Echo or Echo Dot, you can get the service for $4 per month (although it will only work on that device). No other major subscription service has been able to dip below the standard $10 monthly price tag, making Amazon’s lower cost a unique competitive advantage. While it’s no Spotify, Amazon Music Unlimited launched as a perfectly decent, cross-platform music service. And the company is already starting to improve the service with more hand-curated playlists and exclusive content deals like the one it recently signed with Garth Brooks. Like Apple and Google, Amazon can afford to invest in this area without much concern for profitability. Expect Amazon to nab quite a few subscribers pretty quickly. Next Wave Of Innovation: Virtual Reality Music execs might have been caught off guard by file-sharing and other technological innovations, but the resulting wounds have taught the industry a valuable defensive tactic: Sleep—to paraphrase Napster’s one-time archnemesis Metallica—with one eye open, lest it get blindsided by change yet again. If virtual reality is going to be as explosive as the experts predict (ballooning to nearly $30 billion in revenue by 2020), the music industry will be ready. Big names like Paul McCartney, U2, Björk, Coldplay, and Deadmau5 are just a few of the artists who have already embraced VR in the form of immersive music videos or live concerts that invite fans onstage. But since consumers are just starting to get acquainted with VR, the music industry has pumped the breaks as it waits for the market for hardware and software (and thus demand for immersive content) to catch up with its ambitions. It’s pretty unusual for the music industry to be ahead of the next wave of innovation, but that’s what’s happening with VR. There are already signs that VR will yield exciting developments for fans and the music industry. Immersive live streams of concerts, for instance, could evolve into a real source of revenue beyond the standard catalogs of recorded music. Music videos, music documentaries, and music-oriented video games can also take on new life in a world where virtual reality headsets are common. There are also interactive music visualizers, which turn songs—or even your own voice—into responsive animations that unfold in front of you. Then there’s the audio itself. For the best experience, immersive music environments will require engineers to mix songs in more spatially complex manners than standard stereo or even surround sound, which could pave the way for innovations in the way music is composed and produced. There could also be money in VR. It’s still early enough that artists and labels can start crafting business models around a simple but familiar logic: Give fans something meaningful and entertaining that they can’t get anywhere else (or easily pirate) and they just might give you their money.

Let me be up front about this report right away – we’re working with parts production numbers, which could indicate several things. That in mind, pay heed to the sign of the times: this could be another indicator that the public already has a smartphone in their pocket, and they’re not quite ready to buy another. According to Nikkei, Apple is set to trim production of its entire iPhone family “around 10% on the year” in the January-March quarter. This information, they say, comes from calculations done by Nikkei based on supplier data. This might be bad news for Apple’s stock – but it might not be all bad, considering the circumstances. This same source’s numbers put Apple’s production cuts for the iPhone 6s – at this same time last year – at 20%. That’s 20% less production than the year before in the first quarter of the year. This could mean that Apple is inching toward a new normal – not quite as good as it was a few years ago, but still not something to panic about. Nikkei also suggests that a source “at a major parts producer” said that Apple’s production cuts are “within expectations.” What they don’t say is what they expect parts production to do next year. This is year which could produce an iPhone that’s quite a bit different from years past. For more information on what’s possible in the next year for the iPhone, have a peek at the timeline below. Apple is reaching a point at which the tick-tock schedule for the iPhone might not make sense for much longer. This year will still likely make for an easy win with the iPhone 7s, but the year after this – big things.

These modular tiles probably won’t replace traditional lamps or ceiling bulbs, but the customizable LED lights provide visually impressive colorful (and pricey) accent lighting. See it in action below: Nanoleaf’s Aurora smart lighting system retails for $199 for a starter kit that includes nine panels, nine linkers, the HomeKit-compatible controller, 28 3M mounting strips, and the power supply. That’s comparable in price to the Philips Hue smart lighting system which includes three color-changing A19 LED bulbs and a HomeKit-compatible bridge, but the novelty of Aurora is unmatched by any other HomeKit lighting solution on the market. Aurora is modular so you can create a variety of designs from the same nine tiles, or add additional tiles to create more complex layouts. Each lighting panel can connect to up to three more lighting panels with one linker connecting two tiles. Aurora intelligently detects what layout you’ve created, then maps it on Nanoleaf’s companion app where you can set color flows, brightness, speed, and more. Additional tiles are sold in sets of three for $59.99 which is about the cost of one additional Philips Hue color bulb. Check out our hands-on video with Nanoleaf Aurora below: Subscribe to 9to5Mac for more videos HomeKit support means you can also set colors and brightness with Siri, Apple’s new Home app, or through automation based on time or commands that control other accessories. For example, you could have a scene called Movie Night that turns off the ceiling light and sets the Aurora lights to deep blue at 10% brightness; just tell Siri to ‘set Movie Night scene’ and your connected accessories automatically jump to the right mode. Apple’s Home app doesn’t support multicolor waves from the built-in color picker — only solid colors — so you’ll want to spend more time in Nanoleaf’s app at first to discover different color effects. HomeKit makes changing the brightness, toggling the lights on and off, and setting solid colors very convenient. You can also turn color effects you discover or create in Nanoleaf’s app into scenes in Apple’s Home app. This is where HomeKit support’s potential is really unlocked. You can use Siri to change between dramatically different color effects, or pick a few favorites to access from Control Center. You can also automate specific color effects using Apple’s Home app. For instance, you can have Aurora display a vibrant sunrise color effect at 7 am each morning or even based on the actual sunrise time where you live. Simply using Siri to turn Aurora on, change the color effect and brightness, and turn Aurora off makes HomeKit support super valuable. Setting up Aurora can be a bit intimidating, but Nanoleaf provides the necessary  supplies including paper templates that let you mock up a design on your wall before sticking tiles. Nanoleaf also has a series of very helpful video tutorials that I found useful before installation. Nanoleaf’s packaging is pretty minimal and easy to break down and recycle (the box even asks you to) which I appreciated. The power supply includes plenty of cable length for wiring the controller to where you need it, and each tile is pretty light and can stand a few accidental drops (trust me). Nanoleaf recommends connecting each panel right out of the box before you starting hanging anything to make sure there are no defects. The first panel connects to the controller, then each additional panel connects with a small tab called a linker that inserts into both panels to pass power and data. 3M mounting strips hold each panel in place on the wall. Nanoleaf recommends exposing the non-adhesive tab on each mounting strip so panels can be easily removed in the future, and you can strategically place them so that the connecting tile covers the exposed tab. The process is super easy once you get the hang of it. Deciding on a design pattern may be the hardest step. Nanoleaf provides several ideas in the setup guide including four patterns that work with the starter kit, four more designs that work when adding the expansion kit, and seven ideas when using 15 and 30 panels. You can make any pattern with your panels, though, and the Nanoleaf app recognizes it and reflects it on your smartphone or tablet. I was tempted to go with the fish layout, but ultimately decided on a more linear layout to cover a few scratches on the wall from guitars. A few things to keep in mind: each panel is lit by three LEDs which are more noticeable at high brightness levels, the controller is wired and may not sit flush like each tile so try to place it out of sight, and consider how the plasticky white panels will appear when not lit before deciding on placement. Aurora is visually impressive and well integrated with Apple devices and Siri thanks to HomeKit, and Nanoleaf makes the lighting system both easy and fun to set up with the modular design. The starter kit is pricey for mood lighting at $200, but overall the product is very well done. I can definitely imagine purchasing additional starter kits to create different designs in other rooms in the future. My office has a ceiling bulb connected to a HomeKit wall switch, a HomeKit bulb in a desk lamp, two studio lights connected to a HomeKit switch, and now Aurora which is overall my favorite for just general background lighting. Nanoleaf Aurora is like a beautiful screensaver for your wall. Pair that with some music you enjoy and you can create a very ambient lounge experience. Nanoleaf Aurora starter kit is available for $199.99, Aurora expansion kit retails for $59.99, and Best Buy is currently bundling Aurora starter kit and expansion kit together for $199.98. Nanoleaf also makes other interesting HomeKit lighting solutions like the Ivy (reviewed) which you can find on Amazon.

 'Within expectations:' Apple will cut iPhone production to start 2017 Kif Leswing and Reuters Dec. 30, 2016, 1:42 PM 9,727 facebook linkedin twitter email print Hollis Johnson/Business Insider Apple will trim production of iPhones by about 10% in the January-March quarter, Nikkei reported, citing calculations based on data from suppliers. The company slashed output by 30% in the January-March quarter in 2016 because of accumulated inventory, Nikkei reported. Apple sold fewer iPhones in its fiscal 2016 than it had in the previous year for the first time since the iPhone was introduced. 'Within expectations' A source at a parts supplier told Nikkei that the cut was "within expectations," suggesting that Apple's suppliers have been preparing to reduce their dependency on the Cupertino, California, company. The production cuts are likely to affect Apple's 4.7-inch iPhone 7 — not the larger, more expensive iPhone 7 Plus. Demand is stronger for that device, and Apple has had trouble filling demand because its two-lens camera is difficult to manufacture. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo in November forecasted a year-over-year production decline over the entire first half of 2017. "We forecast total shipment volume of iPhones will decline YoY in 1H17 due to weak demand in China, slow shipment volume of 4.7-inch iPhones in 1Q17, and the lack of a new iPhone SE in 2Q17," he wrote in a note distributed to clients in November. The gloomy outlook for sales of Apple's iPhone 7 in 2017 is another reason the company is widely expected to launch an impressive iPhone model in September with a higher-quality screen, wireless charging, and new glass design. Apple's shares were down under 1% in midday trading.

On December 24, 2014, the Modisettes were on Interstate 35, with James needing to slow the car down due to road congestion. The family’s car was then rear-ended by another car at 65 miles per hour, which left Moriah, one of the Modisettes’ daughters, with severe injuries that later resulted in her death. When talking to police, the 20-year-old driver who crashed into the Modisettes’ car admitted to using FaceTime on his iPhone 6 Plus while driving. According to the Modisettes’ complaint, authorities found the FaceTime app open and a call in progress when they arrived at the scene. More: A car accident almost took my brother away, but FaceTime brought him closer The crux of the complaint, which was filed in the Santa Clara County Superior Court in California, does not concern itself with the driver that rear-ended the family’s vehicle. Instead, the lawsuit asserts that the driver’s conduct is “inextricably intertwined” with Apple’s failure to implement a FaceTime feature that renders the app inaccessible while someone is driving. The complaint also chastised Apple for not implementing the aforementioned FaceTime lockout feature, even though the company has the patent for it. Finally, because the iPhone 6 Plus does not implement the technologies for the feature, the lawsuit claims Apple acted with intent to cause injury, with a “willful and knowing disregard of the rights and safety of another” in order to make a profit. “Despite both the technology since 2008 and a patent on that technology so it could exploit its patent without competition for 20 years, defendant Apple has consistently and continuously failed to implement a safer, alternative design that would lock-out and prevent use of FaceTime while driving,” reads a relevant portion of the complaint. The Modisettes’ lawsuit seeks damages, including punitive damages, and medical expenses. Digital Trends reached out to Apple for comment and will update accordingly. Also watch: Share

The UltraFine 5K and 4K displays are optimized for the Mac with tight software integration, and the 5K model in particular with single-cable connection over Thunderbolt 3 has been highly anticipated. Apple has just begun shipping the UltraFine 5K display, and while a handful of lucky customers received their deliveries late last week, availability is significantly increasing this week and we've had about 24 hours with ours to develop some initial impressions. Setup Unlike some other displays, LG's UltraFine 5K comes fully assembled in the box, making setup a breeze. Once you pull the protective sleeve off the display itself and some foam wrap off of the display's foot (and easily peel off an Energy Star sticker), it's just a matter of finding a spot for it on your desk, plugging in the power cord, and connecting the Thunderbolt 3 cable to your MacBook Pro. Also unlike some other displays, the power supply is built into the display itself, so there is no large external power brick to have to find a place for. While the display comes fully assembled, the stand can be easily removed for transport or if you wish to use a VESA arm or wall bracket for mounting the display. LG includes a separate rear cover in the box for use with VESA mounts to make it simple to convert from standing to mounted setups. The UltraFine 5K includes smooth spring and friction height adjustment, making it easy to move the display up and down over a range of 110 mm to find just the right height, while the display can be angled up or down over a range of –5 to +25 degrees. Vertical orientation of the display is not supported, although it can be rotated slightly left or right to compensate for minor leveling issues. A Kensington lock slot is included if you need to secure the display to a desk or other fixed object. With the LG UltraFine 5K able to supply up to 85 watts of power over USB-C, this truly is a one-cable solution even for the 15-inch MacBook Pro, at least for basic setups. The display includes a 1920x1080 camera, speakers, and three downstream 5 Gbps USB-C ports that provide up to 1.5 amps to allow for additional peripherals to be connected hub-style. There isn't even a power button on this display, which keeps the look and functionality clean and simple as the display automatically sleeps and wakes depending on the state of the connected computer. While it's a simple design, the fact that there's a single cable for data and power means that if you want to charge your MacBook Pro through the display, the UltraFine 5K has to be on, which may be an issue for a few users. Build Quality Make no mistake, this doesn't look like an Apple display, but it's certainly not terrible. A metal foot provides solid stability, while the rest of the body is a matte black plastic. My desk setup includes a hutch and I tend to keep the lighting in my office fairly dim, so everything about this display except for the screen itself kind of disappears into the background and doesn't bother me. But if you plan to have this display sitting prominently out in the open, you'll probably notice it's not the prettiest thing on the market. Bezels are a bit larger than many other displays, particularly on the top where the camera and microphone are housed. To be honest though, when you set this display up you're not going to be looking at the bezels. It's the gorgeous 27-inch screen that catches your eye. The 218 ppi IPS display is likely an identical or very similar panel to the one used in Apple's 27-inch Retina iMac, supporting 99 percent of the P3 spectrum for improved color display. The screen itself has a glossy finish, although it does generate considerably less glare than the Apple Thunderbolt Display users may be familiar with. Ports A Thunderbolt 3/USB-C port is the sole input available on the UltraFine 5K, which means you won't be able to hook up multiple sources such as over HDMI or DisplayPort and switch between them. The MacBook Pro uses Thunderbolt 3 over the USB-C port to drive the full 5K resolution over a single cable, while older Thunderbolt Macs can use Apple's adapter to drive the display at lower resolutions. On the downstream side, the three 5 Gbps USB-C ports with 1.5 amp power delivery make for a decent connectivity hub, but the lack of USB-A ports also means you'll likely need some adapters if you want to hook up your peripherals. Resolutions The UltraFine 5K can be managed alongside other displays within the Displays section of System Preferences, and it defaults to a Retina 2560x1440 display, taking full advantage of the massive 5120x2880 screen. Unsurprisingly, text and Retina-optimized images are extremely sharp in this mode. I've been testing the UltraFine 5K as part of a three-display setup, alongside an Apple Thunderbolt Display and the MacBook Pro's own screen. The Retina 2560x1440 display offers the same desktop size as my Apple Thunderbolt Display, which makes for a natural layout and easy transitions between displays. With its Retina display, the UltraFine 5K is obviously much sharper than the Apple Thunderbolt Display, a fact that's impossible to miss. My current desk setup: Apple Thunderbolt Display on left, UltraFine 5K in the middle, and new 15-inch MacBook Pro on right If you prefer a different resolution for the UltraFine 5K, you can select from several other resolution options in System Preferences, including 3200x1800, 2880x1620, 2048x1152, and 1600x900. Interestingly, Apple doesn't offer anything higher than 3200x1800 as a recommended scaled option, although the full 5120x2880 (as well as 1440x810 and 1280x720 low-resolution options) is available if you hold down the option key while clicking the Scaled resolution option. Unsurprisingly, everything is really tiny at the full resolution, as this display packs a lot of pixels. LG Screen Manager The UltraFine 5K and its 4K sibling are supported by an LG Screen Manager app for Mac, which is very similar to the OnScreen Manager app users of some other LG displays might be familiar with. LG Screen Manager supports automatic splitting of a desktop, allowing you to divide your screen into up to four sections to allow multiple apps to be automatically displayed maximized to the size of the section and preventing them from overlapping. As you drag an app to a section, other apps are automatically moved to other sections of the display and everything is resized to fit their new locations if necessary. Example of LG Screen Manager's split view – Dragging Safari from bottom right section to left section will automatically arrange and resize the window to fit the desktop section LG Screen Manager's most handy implementation is through a menu bar app that allows quick access to the different screen splitting options, but it also includes a fully windowed app that allows access to the same options, as well as software updates for the display and links to Apple's System Preferences for adjusting resolution and more. LG Screen Manager menu bar app (left) and main app (right) Bottom Line If you're in the market for a 5K display to use with your new MacBook Pro, you don't really have any other options, as the Thunderbolt 3 standard is just hitting the market. Regardless, this is a very solid display. Image quality is terrific, as anyone with a Retina iMac can attest, with accurate color representation and sharp text and graphics. The physical design may not match Apple's aesthetic, but it's serviceable and relatively non-obtrusive, while the build quality is solid. The $1299 list price is certain to give many pause given other Ultra HD and 4K options on the market for half the price or less, but with Apple's 25 percent discount dropping the price to $974 through the end of March, it really makes this display worth considering. The jump to 5K truly does make a difference compared to displays in the 4K range and the quality of this display is fantastic. The included camera, microphone and speakers are also nice additions for keeping a clean setup if you don't have high-end requirements, and many users upgrading from the Apple Thunderbolt Display would miss them if they hadn't been included. On the downside, the single input may be an issue for some, while only having three USB-C ports on the rear of the display for downstream connections isn't ideal given the USB-A world we're mostly still living in. But USB-C is the future, so the situation will only improve as more and more peripherals adopt the standard. Apple is currently the only authorized retailer for the UltraFine 5K, with online orders currently being quoted shipping estimates of 2–4 weeks and in-store pickup dates listed as early February. Apple's discounted pricing extends through March 31, so users considering placing an order should make sure to lock things in before then.

To be clear, LG did not pay for the post or provide the display. I tried to be fair in my assessment, although I'll admit it's a bit superficial given the limited time I've had with it, so it's more of an impressions post than a full review. The screen is excellent, while the aesthetics of the design are up for debate. They don't really bother me, but I know some people hate the design. It's subjective.

They've made more mistakes THIS YEAR than on your 10 year long list. Most of what you list are problems or manufacturing issues. Not MISTAKES. Not mis-steps.

Rating: 11 Votes HadrianMQ 3 days ago at 10:24 am I used Apple products because they are beautiful, sturdy, and cooperate together. I love the harmony of the ecosystem and aesthetics. If I wanted function over form, I would buy PCs - oh wait - I did this year because Apple hasn't updated some products in years. This 3rd party device is part of a problem at Apple and their brand. I've replaced my Airport, monitors, PC, and AppleTV since the ridiculous Apple announcement of the MacBook in October - I am eyeing Google Pixel for phone and tablet in the coming months too. I even abandoned iCloud for Google services. And Siri is a joke next to Google Assistant, so Google Home will happen soon. Apple will need a big bang release of a lot of stuff at one time to really knock my socks off - but I just don't think they can pull it off.

Bigger, better, and curved displays, an all-glass design, wireless charging, and a new embedded home button are just some of the features Apple is reportedly considering for the iPhone 8. Head below for our full roundup of everything we currently know about Apple’s next flagship.  4.7 to 5.8-inch Displays | OLED | Curved  There have been a lot of varying reports about screen sizes for the upcoming iPhones. Updated 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models like the current flagship iPhone 7/7 Plus lineup appear to be in the works, but there are also many reliable reports of a new 5.8-inch flagship model incoming… That 5.8-inch model, according to one report, will actually have a 5.2-inch panel of usable touchscreen space with the remainder of the display curving around the edges of the device. And it’s not just that report that points to evidence Apple is working on a new curved display for some upcoming iPhone models. The Wall Street Journal recently confirmed Apple is prototyping a hi-res curved-screen model as a possible top-tier iPhone 8, and a separate report citing supply chain sources claimed Apple was partnering with LG Display on a foldable OLED for upcoming iPhones. While the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 is said to be the first to switch to an OLED display, one report said the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch updates would remain with LCDs. Though there are a couple additional reports that a 5-inch iPhone model is also being planned for next year, it’s unclear where that would fit in the lineup if accurate, especially if a 4.7-inch model does indeed stick around. Lastly, the company is said to not be planning an update to its current iPhone SE model introduced last March, the last of the 4-inch iPhone models on the market. Apple reportedly sourcing 5.8-inch AMOLED panels for next iPhone exclusively from Samsung Report: Apple planning new 5-inch iPhone model with vertical dual-camera design for 2017 LG Display reportedly partnering with Apple on foldable OLED for upcoming iPhones Report: Apple iPhone 8 to feature plastic, curved, OLED display New profile sheds light on Apple’s push to switch to OLED displays with iPhone 8 Apple prototyping hi-res curved-screen model as possible top-tier iPhone 8 – WSJ Apple planning one 5.2-inch OLED iPhone 8 with major redesign + 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch LCD models iPhone 8: No OLED display expected on 4.7-inch and some 5.5-inch models, dual camera staying Plus exclusive iPhone 8 Plus model likely to use OLED display says Sharp CEO, company could make future iPhone OLEDs in US Nikkei: iPhone 8 will introduce 5-inch version iPhone sales expected to drop in 1st half of 2017 without new SE model, Apple to put margin pressure on suppliers All-Glass Design | New Colors | Apple is planning a new design for the 2017 iPhone lineup that will ditch the aluminium body of the current models in exchange for an all-glass design with metal only around the edge of the device. This comes from several supply chain reports in recent months from typically reliable sources. Think iPhone 4/4S, Apple’s last iPhone model to sport glass on both the front and back, although likely with a much sleeker design overall thanks to the curved display reportedly being planned. The iPhone 4 was offered in black and white, but Apple could have other options as well… A separate report said Apple is planning a red chassis as a new color option for an upcoming iPhone, and there are still rumors floating around that the company is working on a white color option for iPhone 7 that could presumably make its way to the “iPhone 8” next year too. Apple reportedly introducing a red chassis color option with new ‘iPhone 7s’ in 2017 Nikkei: iPhone 8 will introduce all-glass backs across lineup KGI: Apple to drop aluminum iPhone casing in 2017 in favor of new ‘all glass’ enclosure with AMOLED screen KGI: Apple to revamp iPhone lineup in 2017 w/ iPhone 4-like design Wireless charging | If all the supply chain chatter is accurate, wireless charging functionality could be one of the highlight new features for the iPhone 8. A recent report from KGI said Apple was planning to offer wireless charging on three new iPhone models (4.7-inch, 5.5-inch and the new 5.8-inch), though the supply chain analysts also suggested the wireless charger would not be bundled with the device and instead sold as a separate accessory. Backing up the report, separate supply chain intel back in October claimed Apple manufacturing partner Foxconn was producing and testing wireless charging modules for iPhone 8. Inductive wireless charging has been available via accessories and on other smartphones for quite a while, but Apple has made it known publicly that it doesn’t like the tech. The company’s head of marketing Phil Schiller noted back in 2012 that “wireless charging systems still have to be plugged into the wall, so it’s not clear how much convenience they add.” That’s what makes Apple’s reported connection with Energous, a company that has developed a truly wireless charging solution called WattUp, all that more interesting. The technology can charge devices from up to 15ft away using a single transmitter and a receiver embedded into your device. That means no charging mats or additional accessories to plug-in like current solutions. A recent report noted that Apple supplier Dialog has partnered with Energous. Before that discovery, a separate story detailed what appeared to be evidence between Apple and Energous, although the company later responded, it didn’t deny a partnership with Apple. Ahead of iPhone 8, Apple supplier Dialog partners with long-range wireless charging company Energous iPhone 8 to eclipse sales record set by iPhone 6, wireless charging on high-end and low-end models Apple to incorporate wireless charging into ‘all-glass’ iPhone 8 in 2017, but wireless charger may not be bundled in the box Report: Foxconn currently producing & testing wireless charging modules for iPhone 8 KGI: Apple to revamp iPhone lineup in 2017 w/ iPhone 4-like design, wireless charging More evidence Apple is working on wireless charging tech with Energous Embedded Home Button | It has been rumored for several years now that Apple is experimenting with a Home button embedded right into the iPhone’s display and Apple even has patents for such a concept. That would allow it to reduce or perhaps remove the bezel on the front and increase screen real-estate without increasing the size of the device. One patent showed Apple is even exploring methods of allowing fingerprint recognition almost anywhere on the screen. Add in the curved display that Apple is reportedly considering for at least some of the new iPhones and you can imagine what could be quite a stunning update for the front side of the iPhone 8 with near edge-to-edge glass. NYT corroborates rumors of ‘full-screen face’ 2017 iPhone with embedded Home button Apple again said to remove Home button with iPhone coming in 2017 WSJ: iPhone 7 w/ similar design and removed headphone jack this fall, major changes next year Latest Apple patent appears to show fingerprint recognition almost anywhere on the screen Bezel-free iPhone a step closer as third Apple patent published for Touch ID sensor embedded in display Report: Apple already working on putting a virtual Home button into the iPhone screen Augmented Reality | While the reports on these features are few and far between at this point, there are at least some clues that augmented reality features are in the cards for future iPhones, perhaps even starting with the iPhone 8. In January, 2016 a report said Apple was building a secret research team to develop virtual and augmented reality tech including reportedly prototyping VR headsets. A  separate report back in November claimed Apple is working on AR features that will debut first in a future iPhone’s camera app and tap into technology the company picked up through its acquisition of Metaio and others. That includes object and facial recognition camera features, according to the report, with plans for an SDK for app developers down the road. A separate report from Bloomberg said Apple is exploring digital glasses that could be released as early as 2018.

Moriah Modisette was sitting in the back seat of her parents' car when another vehicle slammed into them - killing the five-year-old. Driver Garrett Wilhelm, 22, is accused of using FaceTime at the moment he hit Moriah's parents James and Bethany's car at 65mph. According to investigators Wilhem, who has been charged with manslaughter, still had FaceTime active when police officers arrived at the fatal crash scene. Garrett Wilhelm was arrested following the crash (Photo: Police Handout) Moriah was killed in the accident on Christmas Eve 2014, but her parents have now reportedly launched a suit against Apple claiming FaceTime was a 'substantial factor in causing the plaintiff's injuries and decedent's death.' In court papers the family, from Texas, allege Apple is responsible for the death because of its "failure to install and implement the safer, alternative design for which it sought a patent in December 2008 to ‘lock out’ the ability of drivers to utilize the ‘FaceTime’ application on the Apple iPhone when driving a motor vehicle, which resulted in the injuries sustained by plaintiffs". Read More Woman hands sippy cup 'filled with wine to child to avoid being caught drink driving by police' The family further says in its complaint: "Defendant Apple Inc. has had the technology to prevent these events, and the Modisettes’ injuries, specifically since at least Dec. 12, 2008, when it filed an application with the US Patent Office for a ‘driver handheld computing device lock-out." The FaceTime app appears on Apple phones (stock image) (Photo: Getty) The Modisettes also claim that by failing to implement the alleged technology, Apple has "breached a duty of care to plaintiffs." Wilhelm was on his way to visit his parents when he allegedly smashed into the rear of the Modisettes' Toyota.

As consumers hurried to buy Apple’s new product this holiday season, Inventec is now rumored to have started expanding its capacity in some of its plants in Shanghai “in order to satisfy increasing demand for the earphones and the plants are currently working overtime to deliver orders,” the report says. When the AirPods were released on Dec. 13, Apple noted the earphones would begin shipping in “limited quantities” at launch, which was rumored before. However, the shipping date was extended to more than four weeks, and six weeks a day after the AirPods were released. But customers said they were notified that they were getting their wireless earphones sooner than they expected.

Apple CEO Tim Cook called the AirPods a “runaway success” in an interview with CNBC this week at the New York Stock Exchange. "We're making them just as fast as we can," he said. Cook added that Apple has had a “great” holiday season overall. The AirPods, which come with a charging case, are priced at $159. The product was announced during Apple’s September event alongside the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The AirPods were supposed to launch in October but the release date was delayed.

Skip to content Search for: Search Kopitiam Bot News · Lifestyle · Tech · Singapore Home Current Affairs Technology Startups Money Matters Lifestyle Contact Us About Technology Can we go back in time and wipe Assassin’s Creed film from our DNA? Date: 2016-12-31Author: kopitiambot (Source: arstechnica.com) The most telling line in the Assassin’s Creed film, based on the video games of the same name, comes about midway through the film. Our hero, Callum Lynch (Michael Fassbender), is bombarded by nonsensical comments while trying to eat his lunch. After he’s left alone for a moment, he chuckles to himself—the first and only time he does so in an organic fashion through the whole movie—before exclaiming, “What the fuck is going on?” I’m shocked that the filmmakers left this moment in the film, seeing as how Assassin’s Creed’s every element—the plot beats, the characters’ decisions, the logical leaps—begs such a question. Assassin’s Creed has the dubious honor of combining ho-hum action sequences, half-baked characters, and a script no larger than a doctor’s free pamphlet. The results leave both series fans and curious passersby with nothing to sink their hidden blades into. Apple of no one’s eye Lynch’s origin story will sound familiar to anybody who has ever played the games. Most of them star a modern Everyman-with-a-checkered-past… who just so happens to have a bunch of badass assassin ancestors. Rather than try to recreate the games’ longtime protagonist, Desmond Miles, Director Justin Kurzel (Snowtown) starts from scratch with Fassbender’s Lynch—who, much like Miles, almost immediately gets tangled up with a shady research institute. Lynch is kidnapped, and his body is plugged into a giant, hydraulic claw. This device, called the Animus, reads Lynch’s DNA before overloading his mind and senses with the feeling that he’s back in the year 1492. Convinced he’s in the Renaissance, Lynch relives the adventurous memories of a Spanish ancestor named Aguilar who was a member of a longtime order of assassins. They were charged with protecting the world’s citizens from an equally longtime order of devious “Templars.” (By the way: Spain, 1492. Yes, you are free to start groaning at the duhhh-I-saw-it-coming possibilities.) At the outset, I had faint hopes that Kurzel’s film might pull off a high-octane version of Quantum Leap or Doctor Who. The game series, after all, updates its location, time, and historical potential with every entry. The problem with the game sequels is that they rarely match their new settings with new gameplay. With TV or a film, on the other hand, that kind of new-every-episode refresh can be a fun way to mix familiar, beloved characters with new villains and bizarre circumstances. The film’s first problem comes from how painfully thin the script is. Does Lynch have a personality? Hard to tell. All he gets to do is groan about his captivity, groan about his pain, and groan about his confusion. His history and personality are hinted at with a three-second glimpse at a wall of news clippings about his life—the kind of stuff, I should note, that gamers would get to pore over during a lengthy quest. Movie viewers aren’t given this luxury. The only other speaking character with a sliver of personality is Sofia, played by Oscar-winner Marion Cotillard. She’s the primary researcher assigned to Lynch’s DNA depths. She wants Lynch to help her discover Eden’s Apple—a holy relic that she’s been led to believe will let her “cure” all of mankind’s violent tendencies. Spoiler alert: Eden’s Apple does this by depriving all humans of their capacity for free will. When Sofia eventually learns this from Rikkin (her father, played by Jeremy Irons), she acts plum-shocked that such a thing could happen. Um, no. Cotillard’s biggest screw-up in her portrayal of Sofia is that she’s clearly a good actress, and she therefore resembles a reasoned, emotionally capable person who should have such insight. “Maybe taking away the ability to be violent, which has decided the fates of various species throughout the entirety of evolution, might be a misguided goal,” you’d expect her to mutter at some point. That doesn’t happen. We only hear insipid one-liners, as if we’re too stupid to question how ridiculous they sound. When Rikkin stands before a UN-like committee in an early scene, he declares, “The economic impact of antisocial behavior was $9 trillion last year.” What? What’s the metric here? Reality TV ratings? Number of houses TP’ed in the nice part of town? Ninja, ninja, rrrrrap Assassin’s Creed’s modern-day characters receive no development, and gosh, the fact that the movie squanders Michael “Omar from The Wire” Williams as a result is unforgivable. Worse, once Lynch enters the Animus and slashes dozens of fools in 15th-century Andalusia, dialogue pretty much drops to zero. Even the worst Assassin’s Creed games pump their worlds full of dialogue, stories, and history odes—and those are often my favorite parts of the games because they show just how much the series’ developers love their source material. Kurzel seems content to conjure up an imaginary version of Renaissance Spain. If the action were up to snuff, that might be tolerable. Bad news: Assassin’s Creed is replete with some of the most cookie-cutter martial arts to pad a blockbuster in years. You wanna know Fassbender’s cleverest attack? While cocking an arrow back, he uses his elbow to smack a guy’s jaw before releasing the arrow and shooting someone else. (“Elbow-and-arrow,” I wrote in my notepad.) Further Reading How Ubisoft kept the lid on Assassin’s Creed III‘s biggest spoilerThe main reason I clearly remember that elbow-to-jaw moment is because nothing else came close, unless you count the film’s final, hilariously awkward fight. This cheeseball, one-at-a-time karate-and-swords fight—complete with armies of armed guards who shout maniacally for no logical reason—better resembles something out of a ’90s Ninja Turtles film than an Assassin’s Creed game. Did you come hoping for at least a few authentic, series-worthy run-and-climb moments? Fassbender and his ancient-Spain cohorts occasionally jump from rooftop to rooftop, sure, but the whole thing honestly looks more like the Prince of Persia game remasters than it does an Assassin’s Creed title. This film’s namesake games astounded when they first debuted because of their amazing wall-scaling and parkour movement systems. You’re not gonna find much of that here. (Series note: thank goodness at least one dude fell from a great height into a bale of hay, but not the same way that you do in the games.) I appreciate that the film relies largely on practical effects, as opposed to a boatload of CGI. What’s more, the Animus sequences—in which modern-day Fassbender jumps around in a lab and battles transparent, particle-loaded versions of his time-travel foes—look cool on occasion. That’s in spite of the Animus contraption, which straps to Fassbender’s back and resembles this South Park episode. Someone, please go back in time and unmake this movie By the end, the whole production goes off the rails. Its Brave New World Eden’s Apple schtick concludes with Sofia blaming Lynch for committing a crime that she encouraged him to do, at which point she gives up on her save-the-world perspective and turns into a furrow-browed villain (just before the credits roll, of course). This crime, by the way, happens inside the most sensationally protected sanctuary of rich nobles, and it happens so quickly and uncontested that you get the feeling the film’s editor had a train to catch. The only thing that got me through the movie was my belief that Ubisoft could honestly try again. Fassbender is clearly a great actor (although I’ve never seen such talent chained to such a rusty furnace of source material). Someone half as good as Fassbender could carry a serial TV show about a time-traveling assassin who lands in a new time period, complete with tons of series-worthy historical-icon cameos, every 44 minutes. If we could pretend this movie never existed, that’d help. My advice to Ubisoft: please hook one of your executives to the Animus and have him or her assassinate this filmmaking disaster from the nucleotides within all of our DNA.

Apple may manufacture iPhones in India from April 2017 International Business Times 3 days ago Sarmistha Acharya © Reuters/Arnd Wiegmann Apple to manufacture iPhones in India Apple is reportedly planning to manufacture iPhones for Indian consumers in the Silicon Valley of the country, Bengaluru. Wistron, a Taiwanese original equipment manufacturer for Apple is setting up a facility in Peenya, the industrial hub of the city. The facility will begin production from April next year, industry sources told daily news outlet The Times of India. There has been no official word so far about the project. The sources told TOI that Apple is quite serious about starting the assembly operations. The full manufacturing line is expected to begin sometime at the end of next year. The sources said, "Bangalore is being looked at seriously." Apple has even posted job opening on its portal at its OEM's factory in Bengaluru for positions such as operations programme manager and product quality manager. Taiwan-based OEM, Foxconn, was earlier expected to set up a manufacturing plant in the western state of Maharashtra. While there were reports suggesting the plant would make only Apple products, but sources say that Foxconn seems to have tied up with firms such as Xiaomi and OnePlus. Setting up facility is not the first biggest announcement Apple made for India. In May this year the company said it would establish a Design and Development Accelerator in Bengaluru, which the company is calling as first-of-its-kind center to support developers creating mobile apps in India. The iOS App Design and Development Accelerator is expected in early 2017. According to data shared by Counterpoint Technology Market Research, Apple sold 2.5 million iPhones in India from October 2015 to September 2016, marking a rise of more than 50% over the year-ago period. It made INR 9,997 crore (£1.19bn) in 2016 financial year, a 56% growth from INR 6,472 crore earlier.

Available in 500GB or 1TB capacities for $229.95 or $379.95, respectively, the G-Drive Slim is lightweight and portable with a sleek aluminum casing in Silver or Space Gray that matches Apple products. It features USB 3.1 Gen 2 technology and supports transfer speeds of up to 540MB/s. It’s bus-powered and while designed for USB-C machines, it also ships with a USB-C to USB-A cable for use with older Macs. The G-Drive USB-C Mobile is similar to the Slim SSD, but it’s more affordable at $119.95 and features a 1TB 7200 RPM hard drive. The G-Drive USB-C Mobile features support for USB 3.1 Gen 1 with transfer speeds of up to 136MB/s. It’s also made from a lightweight aluminum and is small enough to be tucked into a purse, pocket, or backpack. It comes in Silver, Gold, Space Gray, and Rose Gold to match Apple’s line of MacBooks. The Rose Gold, which we’re giving away, is an Apple-exclusive color (and it’s on sale from Apple.com as part of Apple’s USB-C sale). Like the Slim SDD, it comes with both a USB-C to USB-C cable and a USB-C to USB-A cable for use with older machines.

The drive is actually still working but it's PATA. I always enter these things but never win and forget to ever check who wins or if they ever announce it. The chance you win here is probably less than getting hit by lightning.;) Sorry, couldn't resist.:p Rating: 5 Votes classicalbear 3 days ago at 01:40 pm Can't wait for those to be affordable, SSD is still very expensive. And too bad I'm in Canada :-( Rating: 2 Votes Johnny907 3 days ago at 11:28 pm So why are you an Apple consumer? ... because I can't build a MacBook? Or an iPhone? Or an Apple Watch? Or an iPad? I can, however, easily assemble an external SSD drive for a fraction of the cost of third party solutions like this, thus saving money that can otherwise be used to purchase all of the above mentioned Apple products Rating: 2 Votes rGiskard 10 hours ago at 09:13 am I used to use HDDs striped too, but nah, it's still slow for non-sequential I/O. Your system or a database should run much better on an SSD. Oh definitely, I only use HDD's for backup or audio/video libraries. I'm rockin' a Samsung SM951 boot drive in my Mac Pro. :p Unfortunately the G-Drive SSD is a bit of a dog. ('http://www.anandtech.com/show/10840/gtechnology-gdrive-slim-ssd-usbc-500gb-external-ssd-capsule-review') I'd probably just go for the HDD and use it for backup. Rating: 1 Votes bladerunner2000 3 days ago at 11:24 pm I'll take a free one but I'd never pay 230 bucks for something I could make myself with a $109 512GB SSD and $20 USB-C enclosure that supported UASP and get the exact same performance and form factor for a hundred bucks less. These markups are ridiculous. So why are you an Apple consumer?

Video provided by TheStreet Newslook LOS ANGELES — Apple continued its winning ways in 2016, with one product that sold more units than any other competitor, the top-selling iPhone. But the year was controversial, as the company angered longtime customers by removing popular features from products and falling further behind Amazon, Google and Facebook in innovation. There’s a lot more you can do with your new iPhone than simply take photos, listen to music and make calls.  (Photo: Apple) KTLA-TV tech reporter Rich DeMuro joined USA TODAY for a Facebook Live video chat, as we compared notes on Apple's year. Click the link below to view our nearly 30-minute conversation. "Apple didn't blow us away with anything brand new, but they delivered on what they do best," said DeMuro. Or in other words, the new iPhone and iPads were the same old product with a new skin and a few new features. That said, I find the latest iPhone, the 7 Plus, to be Apple's best ever, with water resistance and a terrific camera with two lenses. Two big issues didn't get fixed, though: a longer-lasting battery and screens that won't crack. Grade: After a string of new products that were more updates than anything new, I give Apple a B- in innovation in 2016, with an A for running the company efficiently. DeMuro offers a C+ for innovation and A+ for operations. That leaves my grade at B and his at B+. The company generated over $200 billion in revenue from the fourth quarter of 2015 through the first three quarters of 2016. KTLA-TV reporter Rich DeMuro joined USA TODAY for a Facebook Live video chat about Apple's 2016  (Photo: Jefferson Graham) But it wasn't an easy year for the company. First Apple gave us a new iPhone without a headphone jack, saying it took courage to ditch the standard port we’ve grown accustomed to all these years. Then it brought us new Macintosh laptops a few months later with a headphone jack, but minus all the accessory slots we pros live on such as an SD memory card slot to import photos, and videos and USB slots to plug in external hard drives and charge the iPhone. USA TODAY I'm really missing the SD slot on the new MacBook Pro Apple introduced smaller versions of the iPhone and iPad, put a smartphone like TouchBar on new MacBook Pros and gave us some odd-looking wireless headphones, called AirPods, that were recently released after a long production delay. USA TODAY Review: After shaky start, Apple's wireless Bluetooth AirPods work great The company tried to convince us that after five years, the personal digital assistant Siri was finally ready for prime time because now developers could add Siri to their apps. DeMuro and I agree that Siri still isn’t cutting it for us, even if you can use it on Uber. JibJab app for iMessages  (Photo: JibJab) Apple did do a good job upgrading the iMessages program in September, bringing in apps and stickers to greatly enhance our texts with more visuals. USA TODAY Did you install Apple's new upgrade? Check out stickers The new Apple Watch is water resistant and has GPS, but it still has a clunky interface with useless apps. That said, kudos to Apple for not giving up on it and still trying. Echo.  (Photo: Amazon.com) With the Mac Pro laptop update, Apple turned its backs on pros and raised prices to the point where many started looking seriously to Windows for the first time in years. Then again, the computer division is tiny compared to the cash cow of the iPhone. Despite Apple losing the cool mantle to competitors, it still outsells everyone. Amazon had a killer year with the Echo-connected speaker that sold out for the holidays. Analysts project Amazon to have sold around 10 million Echos. Apple will sell way more than 200 million iPhones this year, an amazing feat. But watching the company isn't as much fun as it used to be, with all the product stumbles of 2016. Still, don't hold a benefit for Apple CEO Tim Cook & Co. — they're crying all the way to the bank. What’s your grade for Apple? Let’s chat about it on Twitter, where I’m jeffersongraham.

Co. Ltd.’s Best Moves in 2016 In 2016, TSMC enjoyed an improved positioning at Apple, made progress on next-generation technologies, and defended its position in older, lucrative technologies. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Dec 30, 2016 at 9:41AM Contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM), commonly abbreviated as TSMC, has had a good year in 2016. Its stock price is up 28% year to date, and it's expected to enjoy more than 13% revenue growth this year, as well as nearly 10% earnings-per-share growth for the year. The company made a lot of good moves this year. Here are three of its best. Winning all the A10 orders In 2014, TSMC won all of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) A8 chip orders, which meant that every single iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus that was shipped included a TSMC-built applications processor. Considering that the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were enormous successes for Apple, this translated into a nice win for TSMC. In 2015, however, TSMC didn't win the entirety of Apple's A9 chip orders. In fact, numerous reports from the press and the analyst community pointed to TSMC only winning a minority allocation of those chips. However, TSMC is believed to be the sole manufacturer of the A10 processors that power Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones. It's also believed to have won both the chip manufacturing orders, as well as the packaging orders for the A10. (This means more revenue share for TSMC.) Image source: TSMC.  Broadening the business with 7-nanometer tech TSMC is planning to begin generating revenue from its 10-nanometer chip-manufacturing technology in the first half of 2017, but that technology is expected to be short-lived and utilized by only a handful of customers. The next "major" technology from TSMC is expected to be its 7-nanometer technology, which promises performance, power, and area improvements over its 10-nanometer technology. TSMC has said that this technology "has been adopted not only by high-end mobile customers, but also by high-performance computing customers for [graphics processing units], gaming, [personal computers] and tablet[s], virtual reality, server, FPGA, automotive, and networking applications." Although it'll be a while before revenue from these design wins start rolling in -- expect the first revenue during the first half of 2018 -- TSMC's commentary points to strong execution in both the technology, as well as in securing a broad range of customers. It will be interesting to see just how much revenue growth it can drive, especially in applications beyond mobile, in the years ahead. Staying strong in older technologies Although much of the fanfare is around the latest manufacturing technologies from companies like TSMC, the reality is that a lot of the revenue and gross profit dollars that contract-chip manufacturers generate comes from older technologies. While there have been worries that less advanced chipmakers might begin to take share from TSMC in older technologies, like the 28-nanometer technology, TSMC has consistently managed to keep demand very high for such technologies. "Our 28-nanometer capacity remained fully utilized and represented 24% of our wafer revenue in the third quarter," said TSMC CFO Lora Ho. TSMC co-CEO C.C. Wei also said that demand for its 28-nanometer technology "has continued to be strong throughout this year and is expected to last through many years." When management was asked about potential competitive threats from tier-2 chip manufacturers for 28-nanometer business, co-CEO Mark Liu expressed confidence that the company could maintain market share in this technology generation.

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Dec 30, 2016 at 10:10AM While the fourth quarter has not quite ended, and it will take a while to sort out all the winners and losers of the 2016 holiday shopping season, two clear victors have emerged. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) said in a press release that "this 2016 holiday was the best-ever season," noting that it shipped more than 1 billion items worldwide with Prime and Fulfillment by Amazon. The online retailer also reported strong sales for its Alexa-powered devices Echo and Dot, with sales for the artificial intelligence (AI) home assistants seeing sales rise by over nine times compared to last year's holiday season. The other big winner of the season, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), claimed 44% of all phones and tablets activated during the season, according to data from Flurry's Analytics Blog. That's actually down from 49% last year, but it's still double the nearest competitor. Amazon's Echo and Dot devices were big sellers this year. Image source: Amazon. Amazon totally crushed it While the online retailer rarely shares specific sales numbers for its devices or membership counts for Prime, it did offer some information in its post-Christmas press release. The company called the number of devices purchased from its Echo family of products "record setting," while also calling its Fire TV Stick and Fire tablets best-sellers. "Echo and Echo Dot were the best-selling products across Amazon this year, and we're thrilled that millions of new customers will be introduced to Alexa as a result," said Amazon's Worldwide Consumer CEO Jeff Wilke. "Despite our best efforts and ramped-up production, we still had trouble keeping them in stock." Amazon also celebrated (without offering any numbers) its $99-a-year Prime service, which offers free two-day delivery along with other perks. The company said that "more people around the world tried Prime this holiday season than any previous year." It also said that Dec. 23 was the biggest day ever for Prime Now (its two-hour delivery service available in limited markets) with the number of items ordered increasing by three times over last year. A good year for Apple, too Apple does very little discounting during the holiday season (though it did offer some limited deals on Black Friday). That did not stop it from seeing iPhones and iPads fly off the shelves, with the company leading in activations, with 44% of all devices. That's more than twice the 21% Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) was able to score to come in second, according to Flurry. Still, while "Apple devices continue to be the gift to give," according to Flurry, Samsung has to be pleased that it not only held the No. 2 spot, it inched up 1% over last year. That's a victory given the massive recall of Galaxy Note 7s the company had to conduct in 2016. These results show that while Apple remains popular, Samsung had enough goodwill to move past its difficult year. That may be good news for the Galaxy maker in 2017 when Apple will likely release a 7s, not a full update to its phone. The gifts that keep on giving By selling phones and home-based voice assistants in large numbers, both Amazon and Apple set themselves up for a strong year. Anyone who owns an iPhone or iPad will likely buy apps, Apple Music, or other services, putting more money in Apple's coffers. The same is true for Echo, which allows customers to subscribe to Amazon's music service and buy items from the online retailer. In addition, while some people do mix and match, if a person buys an iPad or iPhone, he or she may purchase other devices in the Apple family. The same is true for Amazon, as Echo sales could lead to people buying Fire tablets or Fire TV because they have become comfortable with the retailer's Alexa voice assistant. It's possible for both companies that going forward these sales could lead to consumers using their devices to automate their homes -- allowing for even more sales opportunities.

Garrett Wilhelm, 22, had been using FaceTime when he smashed into the back of James and Bethany Modisette's car going 65mph in 2014, killing their daughter Moriah who was sitting in the back seat. Wilhelm - whose FaceTime app was still active when officers arrived on the scene - faces a manslaughter charge for the crash. But the Modisettes claim that Apple's product was also a 'substantial factor in causing the plaintiffs' injuries and decedent's death.' Moriah Modisette (pictured) was killed in a deadly car crash in 2014 after a driver, who was using Facetime, smashed into her family's car James and Bethany Modisette are suing Apple claiming its FaceTime app was responsible The couple is now suing Apple for undisclosed damages in a wrongful death lawsuit. Filed in California last week, the lawsuit stated that Apple was liable for the fatal crash because its 'failure to install and implement' a patented design to be able to 'lock out' the app while users were driving. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Did YOU get an iPhone for Christmas? Apple dominated the... Share this article Share The patent would have used GPS tracking to determine the speed a user was travelling to prevent the app from working. However, it is not clear how that technology would work for passengers, or people travelling on buses or other public transport. 'Despite both the technology since 2008 and a patent on that technology so it could exploit its patent without competition for 20 years,' declares the court filing, 'defendant Apple has consistently and continuously failed to implement a safer, alternative design that would lock-out and prevent use of FaceTime while driving.'   Little Moriah died from her injuries shortly after the crash on Christmas Eve in 2014 The suit claims that the conduct of the driver was 'inextricably intertwined' with Apple's failure to implement the lock-out feature.  The Modisettes claim in their filing that by failing to implement the technology, Apple has 'breached a duty of care to plaintiffs.' They also claim that the cost of implementing the design would be 'minimal' for Apple and holds 'no conceivable disadvantage' for the tech giant, although provides no evidence in the lawsuit. Garret Wilhelm, (pictured)  of Gainesville, who was on his way to visit his parents in Keller, had slammed into the back of the family's Toyota Camry at speed DailyMail.com has reached out to Apple for comment. The grieving parents filed the lawsuit after the tragic loss of their daughter in the Christmas Eve crash in 2014. James Modisette had been driving with his family on the Interstate 35W when he slowed down as he approached traffic.  Wilhelm, of Gainesville, who was on his way to visit his parents in Keller, had slammed into the back of the family's Toyota Camry at speed. Wilhelm's Toyota 4Runner rolled 'up and over the driver's side of the Modisette car,' the lawsuit states, critically injuring James and five -year-old Moriah, seated behind him. James, his wife Bethany, and their eight-year-old daughter Isabella were taken by ambulance to Denton Regional Medical Center, along with Wilhelm, for treatment. Meanwhile Moriah was airlifted to Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth. She later died of her injuries, reports the Denton Record-Chronicle. Texas is one of the last states which still allows motorists to use their cellphones while driving. However, local ordinances are in effect in both San Antonio and Austin which prevent it.

Happy New Year firework wallpapers The top stories of the week on iDB How to use AirPods like a pro   skip to main content skip to main menu     Samsung developing own AirPods-like earphones for Galaxy S8 launch By Christian Zibreg, Dec 30, 2016 Tweet 169 Comments Samsung is probably going to rip off AirPods next: the company should debut all-new wireless earphones alongside Galaxy S8 launch, according to confidential information received by SamMobile. “Samsung is surely looking to put out a product that competes with Apple’s AirPods,” reads the report. Samsung, of course, was found guilty of lifting Apple’s hardware and software designs in the past. It currently owes the Cupertino firm hundreds of millions of dollars in damages. Back in 2015, Samsung copied the look and feel of Apple’s wired EarPods for Galaxy S6. This won’t be Samsung’s first-ever wireless audio gizmo: the company recently launched a pair of Bluetooth fitness earbuds, called Gear Icon X, depicted top of post. They’re Samsung’s first completely wireless headphones. It’s unclear whether the upcoming earphones would be bundled along with Galaxy S8 or sold separately and if they might use Harman Kardon technology as Samsung is in the process of buying Harman International Industries for a reported $8 billion. SamMobile reported earlier that Galaxy S8 would lose the 3.5mm headphone jack. Bloomberg reported that the upcoming Galaxy will beat iPhone 8 to the virtual Home button and bezel-free appearance because it would use an in-screen Home button. Other outlets have said that a new six-inch Galaxy S8 Plus model would be joining the mix as a viable option for those who may prefer the Note phablet. Last but not least, Galaxy S8 is expected to use Viv personal assistant technology from the creators of Siri, provide dual cameras out the back just like iPhone 7 Plus and possibly boost display resolution to a sharp 4K. Is Samsung’s version of AirPods going to look extremely close in design to the real thing, do you think?

And how is some unknown, unheard of, RUMORED device considering copying? I can’t wait for Apple to release their iPhone edge and see what kind of comments I’ll find here. Docservlet Bluetooth headphones have been around for a long time. Your trying to say that AirPods are the same as any old dumb bluetooth headset. How could you make such a stupid comparison? John Because he doesnt have a clue what hes talking about but thinks he does. jOn Garrett I’m talking about an article about a Samsung product that doesn’t even exist yet somehow Samsung is already accused of copying Apple’s wireless buds when Samsung actually had wireless buds in stores BEFORE Apple even ANNOUNCED their ear tampons. Docservlet Samsung has been consistent in their copying. Rowan09 What did Apple do to you because you’re the biggest fan on this site? Please don’t tell me Samsung hearing aids look better than Apples wireless headsets? jOn Garrett What pissed me off and turned me away from Apple was when I had the iPhone 4. At that time I was an apple fan and had zero interest in Android. So one day, I see a Samsung phone, the one that was in the chimerical where the guy thinks he’s killing a spider but breaks the phone. The display was stunning. I wanted a phone with a display like that. I grew tired of the jailbreaks. Apple trying to control what people do with their own property. I got tired of the cat and mouse iOS updates and waiting for a jailbreak. I was moding my phone more and more to have all those cool things I saw on Android phones so one day I switched. Funny thing is that my first Android phone was shitty, the S2 and I hated everything about the hardware but really liked what I could do with Android. When Steve Jobs made 2 comments I knew at that moment that I would never support apple. 1. When he said 2011 was the year of the copycats when Android OEM’s released their first tablets. The message he sent was clear–the message was that I don’t have the right to buy anything unless I buy it from him. 2. When he called Android a stolen product!!! I was like what? WTF is this guy saying? He’s a sick fuk. So then he goes on to say that he would spend all of Apple’s billions on his (failed) war against Android. So again, this man tells the world that nobody has the right to offer competing products and I have to buy only his. Those 2 things turned me off immensely, if Samsung or Google ever does that I’d never buy their sh’!t again either. I would not buy another iPhone until the 6 plus which died of touch disease and or a bad battery. I only bought the i7 because the 6 plus died. Rowan09 Oh now I see. Android was stolen software hence they pay Microsoft and others royalty. Did you see how an android phone was suppose to look before the iPhone was released? Androids were going to look like a blackberry bold and changed after the iPhone was released. jOn Garrett There’s nothing wrong with them reworking it. They’d be stupid not to, that’s how competition works. The Android OS was not stolen, they changed it from hardware interface to touch. Touch interface existed a decade before the iPhone and capacitive touch wasn’t developed by apple. Companies have every right to licence their tech to other OEM’s LG chose to do so. Take what’s coming up next, wireless charging from a distance–Apple had ZERO to do with its development, they’re going to license it as will Samsung and others but guess how it will be spun on this site and others? Rowan09 Hold on Apple is licensing true wireless? Where did you read that story? Who told you Apple doesn’t invest into some tech development? jOn Garrett Far field wireless charging is almost a decade old and several companies have been developing this tech since then. There’s a company called Energous, I think that’s how it’s spelled–I read somewhere a while back that both Samsung and Apple have invested in this company. There are 2 other companies that Apple will partner with, I can’t remember the names but I’ll try to find them for you. Rowan09 Right Apple doesn’t need to make everything that would just be stupid. As I stated investing into the tech means paying cash for it. I and everyone cares less who makes it in future phones, if Apple is first and it works they get the credit and vice versa. Wireless charging on the S devices are really not needed at all and if you don’t buy a wireless pad you are not missing out on any experience. jOn Garrett Tech doesn’t leap over tech. Without black and white TVs they’re would be no color. Prop planes before jets, and muskets before M-16’s That doesn’t mean that those things of the past were not good or were not useful. You can’t say that wireless charging on S devices aren’t needed–everybody that has wireless charging now likes it and benefits from it. And I hope you don’t think the next iPhone won’t have the exact same thing because it will. Rowan09 Here’s why it’s a gimmick now but if they do get rid of the headphone jack it’s now becomes needed just like on the iPhone 7. Apple needs wireless charging in its current state on the iPhone 7 because there is only 1 port just like on the rumored S8. On the S7 Edge however it serve no real purpose and doesn’t solve a problem. Something is a gimmick when it doesn’t solve any problem like eye scroll. jOn Garrett Two questions for you and answer them honestly. 1. Why is everything an iPhone doesn’t have its a gimmick? No matter the feature, if iPhones don’t have it it’s a gimmick until the iPhone gets it. What problem was solved by apple removing the jack? So by your own definition Apple removing it was a gimmick. The edge on an iPhone solves no problems. When Apple first used a 64bit processor (with just 1GB of RAM it solved no problems. The S8 being all glass removing it is necessary same with all glass body, that was a necessity to accommodate wireless charging which is why Apple is going back to it. Mike You don’t own a Samsung S7 Edge… You always bash on it like it’s a 10 year old phone. It lags? you probably don’t know how to use it… The screen is a big deal actually you look at it all day long and you don’t watch movies on your phone most of the time. You will be waiting for that file manager for a long long time. Rowan09 Oh yes here we go. If you search the web you hear from fanboy and girls how Touch wiz is horrible and it’s nothing like pure Android, blah, blah, blah. I never comment on something being bad unless I own it. The S7 Edge is slower than the iPhone 6-7. I probably don’t know how to unlock a phone and wait for an application to open up? Come on man I hack and modify everything I own and I am also a repair technician. Do I really have to take a picture now? I owned 2 S7 Edges remember the buy 1 get one free deal with 2 VR headsets. I did that deal. My wife has the S6 Edge and when I got her the S7 Edge she didn’t like it, so I sold it. Even though the gold 32Gb was “sold out” I couldn’t get anything but base price for it. I also sold one the VR headsets once it finally arrived and kept 1 VR and 1 S7 Edge. I have 4 lines with t-mobile (get 3 for $150 get forth line free) My wife has the S6 Edge (1 line), my daughter has an iPhone 6S (second line), I have an iPhone 7 Plus (3rd line) and the other S7 Edge (4th line). I also own a S4 and Note 2 which I kept since I can’t make any money from selling them. jOn Garrett I’m taking about the Gear icon X you fool. And this article is about a Samsung product that doesn’t even exist!!!! Docservlet Gear Icon x are junk you moron. jOn Garrett Dude your brain in junk. Docservlet Dude your brain is a worthless dysfunctional piece of crap John Smith Stop being naive. I myself can make a crappy wireless earbuds just to be called first. Icon was crap jOn Garrett How do you know Icon are crap and the Apple buds are not considering you’re just another iDiot who hasn’t used either. Docservlet Because I’ve owned both idiot jOn Garrett You own a shi’ty boost mobile phone with Android gingerbread and $3 earphones you purchased on the street. Docservlet I owned your little mind. I’ve had android and iPhone since 2009. jOn Garrett So lemme get this straight. Android is so shi’!ty and Apple is so great yet you have been buying Android phones–flagship Android according to your comments for 7 FKing years? Do you realize how stupid you sound? If you’re going to lie, at least try to sound believable. Docservlet So let me get this straight….you don’t think that people can buy and use android phones as part of their jobs for 7 years? And you’re idiotic enough to profess that you think I’m the liar while your troll Apple sites like an insecure dbag? LOL jOn Garrett Your posts are childish and immature. There’s no way you’ve been working anywhere for 7 years. I doubt very much that you’re older than 15. People who have to use certain phones for work done have to buy them, they’re given to them by their employers. Docservlet LOL. You fail at logic as usual. Do you think that those who administer, test and deploy mobile solutions inside of Fortune 500 companies have to buy their own gear. Do you think that perhaps they are responsible for purchasing decisions and deployment? Of course an 8 year old fandroid like you wouldn’t be able to think himself out of a box but I believe we’ve all come to expect that from you. Your posts have reflected your deep sense of insecurity and general state of idiocy. John Smith I have none but seen both reviews on Youtube. AirPods battery = 5 hours. Icon battery = 1 hour, that’s enough to shut your mouth jOn Garrett So watching a YouTube review is the same as using something and judging for yourself????!!!! That’s like watching your friends have sex and saying you did it too! lmfao MvP77 I don’t see how this is saying they are developing air pod like headphones when I been rocking Gear Icon X in the picture since august. Maybe they are developing the icon x 2. Neither Samsung or Apple where the first with completely wireless headphones. Natalie I’m waiting on my Phazon earbuds to get to me. I think they might be the best pair of earbuds on the market to date. John Ure kidding right? MMA Rules Your famous IconX have such bad reviews that people have been returning them, check Amazon! They are a half baked product! MvP77 Oh golly, guess I should return a product I like and use almost daily because some people I don’t know gave it bad reviews. You know, I read a couple bad reviews about my iPhone and MacBook to. Guess I’ll return those also! John Smith “Rocking”? Lol half hour battery life askep3 The iPhone 8 better be good, otherwise anybody who’s not stuck in apple land like me had a much better device to buy (specs at least) Rowan09 Samsung was always about inflated specs, so this is no different. 4K on a phone like Sony did a while back is overkill. Snailpo Why would you settle for less? Docservlet Graphics performance and the fact that you can’t see the difference jOn Garrett Of course you can see the difference and Samsung has VR headsets so why would you say something so stupid? Docservlet Of course you can’t see the difference. The pupils cannot distinguish pixels you moron. jOn Garrett Your grand ma is a moron. And of you’re using a VR headset (which you can’t anyway as an iPhone user) you can clearly see pixels on a 2k display. And I did VR several times, I said nothing about normal use. Docservlet You’re a moron and so is your mom. LOL! Under normal viewing there is no pixelation. I’ll leave the VR gimmicks to you children. My Galaxy Prime What iOS users considered gimmicks before Apple did it… Large screens Widgets Curved screens Water resistance Wireless charging (they own patents) Dual speakers Dual cameras I know for sure I’m missing a lot. Help me out people. What else was a gimmick until Apple did it? Docservlet What iOS users still consider gimmicks: Widgets Curved screens Water resistance Wireless charging (they own patents) Dual speakers I don’t remember anyone considering large screens or dual cameras a gimmick. Those were obviously great features and what is your point? The fact that Samsung released high res screens with crap graphics performance is somehow great? How bout the LG dual camera phone that took horrible photos? Or my crappy S7 Edge with curved screen that’s ridiculous to type on because it has stupid curved screens. Use some logic. My Galaxy Prime You all thought they were gimmicks and we’re so outspoken but now that the iPhone has it, you guys are quiet. I remember when you got 3rd party keyboards. Lol that was the greatest thing to happen to the iPhone but who the hell wants to customize their device right? Customization. Beyond changing your wallpaper is a gimmick. No one considered large screens gimmicks when every iPhone user laughed at Samsung? But then you get it and the iPhone 6 is the best selling iPhone. You can’t type on an S7? What’s wrong with your tiny hands? Do your palms really touch the edges when you type? Buy a case, problem solved. Use 1 handed mode, problem solved. Use 2 hands to type, problem solved. Sell the S7 edge and buy the S7 to suit your Trump like infant fingers, problem solved. Docservlet The iPhone has waterproofing. Still a gimmick. I still don’t use widgets. The curved screen on my S7 is PURE GARBAGE. Wireless charging is something I don’t miss at all from my Palm Pre. The S7 Edge has curved screens. That makes touch accuracy nearly impossible and random edge inputs a reality. What’s wrong with your tiny little brain? Is it broken? Or has it turned to mush from all the abuse? One handed mode doesn’t solve the right edge or left edge problem. Sell your brain and trade it in for something newer. Maybe that will solve the issues you’re having with your infantile mind. 3rd party keyboards are a hilarious example of where fandroids fail. While 3rd party keyboards from China were lapping up your usernames and passwords, iPhone was secure. While Android has the security of an open door, security companies are trying to figure out how to break iPhone encryption. Something Android hasn’t even figure out yet. Your comments are so myopic and imbecilic. My Galaxy Prime Lol so because you don’t use them, no one else does? I see, only technology is made for YOU and if you don’t like something, it means no one else does either. Who cares if companies are pouring millions into VR, you can’t use it so it’s dumb technology right? You don’t miss wireless charging so no one else , including Apple, should care about it? Lol and Swype, that China grown 3rd party keyboard is stealing all of our info. We should alert…Oh, none of this is true? I guess creating a fake reality makes you sound dumb…In reality. Lol iPhone is secure right? I have a text I want to send you. Lol or maybe we can contact the FBI and ask them who cracked through the iPhone’s impenetrable encryption. Docservlet LOL!!! You’re such an idiot. So because you consider these gimmicks as feats of technology because you’re a moron then everyone else should??? LOLOLOL!!! Who cares that companies are releasing junk after junk after junk into the market hoping that these gimmicks stick as opposed to useful products. Who cares that wireless charging was on my Palm Pre and didn’t save Palm? Logic is obviously not your friend. Who cares that for the better part of a decade, everyone was using smartphones and tablets that were absolute junk. Who cares that Android is the most insecure mobile OS on the planet with the highest number of vulnerabilities and user damages. Oh but you have wireless charging and VR? LOLOLOLOLOL! How idiotic are fandroids these days? Incredibly idiotic. Android has not Continuity, Hand Off, iWork, FaceTime, 3D Touch etc etc etc etc etc etc. Android is pure junk. Android is laggy, fragmented software. The Android ecosystem is non existent and fandroids will never understand because of their idiocy and bias. My Galaxy Prime I dont consider them feats of technology, your iPhone buddies do. When they were finally able to do these things, they stopped calling them gimmicks and embraced them. And are you assuming that wireless charging is supposed to save technology? You think wireless charging was a means to save…I can’t argue with you. You think like a wall and I feel dumber for having to explain common knowledge to you. You think you k ow tech but you I my know what an iPhone can do. You don’t even know what Apple is working on so what really do you know? I’m having a back and forth with someone who finds it too difficult to do a google search. Do this, when you think of a comeback, Google it first to see if there’s evidence to back up what you’re saying. Don’t see the evidence, don’t say it. This gives your argument credibility rather than saying something like WhatsApp is only minor even though it has over a billion monthly active users. Android is laggy? Really? Still? Android is an open ecosystem dummy. Android works with many services and…Can I have a discussion with someone who actually knows what’s happening in tech? I feel like I’m spending the majority of my time explaining to this idiot what they can read for themselves in years worth of articles. Please, anyone, can I have an actual conversation with someone who knows the subject? Docservlet Only fandroids consider these gimmicks useful. Just like they thought that hand waving and face unlock were useful. Why? Because fandroids can’t see 2 feet in front of them. When a fandroid is so steeped in their own ignorance that reality is just an inconvenience, it’s convenient just to let them run on their own hamster wheel. While technologies like A10 fusion and NVMe storage blow performance metrics for mobile devices out of the water, you and your buddies hang on to wireless charging and waterproofing! LMFAO!!!! That is just about the most pathetic thing I’ve ever seen. So when I say FaceTime, iMessage, Continuity, Hand Off, iWork etc…I would expect morons like you to actually know what they are. Spend a little time educating yourself rather than saying things like WhatsApp and FaceTime. LOL!!!! Pathetic. That just makes your responses appear even more idiotic. If you’re looking for conversation, maybe you should head over to android police and you whackos can keep telling yourselves that wireless charging and waterproofing are amazing “features”. LMFAO!! Idiots. My Galaxy Prime I can’t believe I need to say this again, Apple is working on wireless charging and they made their iPhone water resistant. APPARENTLY, APPLE CARES ABOUT THESE FEATURES. And without water resistance, I couldn’t respond to you while in the shower, like I am now. This lets me respond to your dumb ass comments without having to wait. “Spend a little time educating yourself rather than saying things like WhatsApp and FaceTime. LOL!!!! Pathetic.” What does this even mean? And I own a Mac. I know what continuity, FaceTime, iMessage, Hand Off and iWork all are. This is also how I know that you can get a similar or better experience on Android. You, however, do not know this. You, unfortunately, don’t know alot. Lol A10 fusion. A chip that runs on an underpowered device is a better selling point over a larger screen, smaller bezels, better low light photography, lol the ability to charge your device while listening to music, and so on? Docservlet So what if Apple made their phones wireless. You mean they added some gaskets to the phone? WHO CARES? You do. You think on the scale of technological advances that Apple has provided that waterproof is high on the list? It wasn’t even a factor for the Google Pixel. That is such an ignorant statement considering the massive gains in chip and storage technology that NO ONE has even come close to. Forget the fact that Apple was first with 64bit while the rest of the industry didn’t even have a road map or comprehensive payment solutions like Apple Pay that Google lifted for Android Pay. Or how bout the telephoto lens that none of the android handsets have and are forced to take grainy software zoom. I’ve owned android since 2009. At least a dozen android handset in that time. They are old, tired pieces of junk. While you talk about idiotic things like bezels and waterproofing, the Apple ecosystem has literally crushed Android/MS to a mockery. The ubiquity of access to telephony and messaging across devices isn’t even a possibility with Android. While you morons drone on about face unlock and hand waving, Apple has managed to provide A10 fusion chips, the Apple Pencil, and the fastest production storage speeds on any smartphone or laptop. Your understanding of technology is so basic and limited that it’s amazing you can put sentences together. You’re simply sounding off fandroid talking points like the rest of your insecure herd. Rowan09 It nice to have opinions not by losing battery life. Why does anyone need a 4K screen on a phone? Remember eye scroll we could do without what happened to it? Having too many choices by default is just as bad as not as much choices. Rowan09 How can a large screen be a gimmick? The main reason Android went to bigger screens is why? Let’s see if you even know the reason. Water resistance is a gimmick how? The S7 Edge while a better looking phone than the S7 doesn’t make it any more useful with the curved screen. Widgets are helpful and I’ve never called them a gimmick because it’s a shortcut. Why would anyone say dual speakers is a gimmick when it amplifies sound? Dual cameras is still a gimmick even on the iPhone 7 Plus which I also own. Snailpo Grab a Samsung and compare it to an iPhone. You can’t tell me you don’t see a difference in screen quality. Graphics performance? If we are talking GPU processing to processing you won’t notice a difference between the 2. Docservlet I own an S7 Edge. Worst purchase I ever made. I do see a difference in the screen. There is a noted yellowish tint in the S7’s display. Colors are more vibrant in the AMOLED displays. iPhone display shows the correct color of white. CAN I SEE PIXELS IN EITHER PHONE? NO! That’s what you don’t get. You can have a 10k display but at what point does it make a difference when your eyes stopped seeing the difference 1080p ago. Snailpo I guess your eyes are not very good because it you look you can easily see the Pixel difference. I have an s7 edge, and an iPhone 7 plus. Just looking at the two you can tell the Samsung has a much clearer screen. Docservlet “clearer screen”. You eyes and your brain are obviously not that good. The human eye cannot distinguish the pixels. The human eye can however distinguish between colors and white and black levels and gradation. I have both phones and see the yellowing features of the AMOLED on the S7 Edge. Snailpo Maybe your eyes can’t, but everyone I have ever known can easily see the difference. Docservlet It’s obvious that you’re attempting to defy human biological limits. LOL….ok supergirl! Snailpo Did you just assume my gender ? Docservlet Yes Snailpo Wow what a bigot ! Docservlet Do you know what a bigot is? Obviously not! LOLOLOL!!! Snailpo Like 95% of democrats in this world… #LiberalsUnite Docservlet Your delusional. There’s no place for your silly politics wether it’s liberal or conservative. I don’t care about delusional ponderings. Ideas are vacuous and meaningless. jOn Garrett He says that knowing damn well he doesn’t own a Galaxy. Docservlet LOL!!! You clueless trolls think people can’t own both devices. Snailpo What point does it make having a super fast SSD on your phone? It’s just a phone. But you still got one don’t ya? What’s the point in having a car ? You could just walk, but you got one huh? jOn Garrett They know, they just hate to admit when the iPhone comes up short. Docservlet LOL….it’s useless. While the iPhone offers useful features like A10 Fusion, NVMe storage, iWork, iCloud, Continuity, Hand Off etc etc you fandroids are busy wearing your phones on your heads. LOLOLOL!!! Stupid. My Galaxy Prime Lol when your chip and the storage type are your best features, you have run out of ideas. Docservlet LOL…when a fandroid thinks that hardware and software performance are not important, you know they’ve failed…at life. My Galaxy Prime Of course I think it’s important. But you get great hardware and software on the majority of Android devices out. Even on low budget devices. How’s that low light photography compared to what’s on the market? That’s a selling point. Can you do manual mode on an iPhone? No? Well I guess that camera software sucks too. Apparently, Apple doesn’t think these 2 are important but at least you have that A10 chip. That thing no one is going to stores asking for it specifically. Wait, didn’t Apple just call for a cut in production? Didn’t they sell fewer devices this holiday season vs the past? I guess the A10 chip isn’t a feature many people care about after all Docservlet On high end android devices you get sub par performance and cheap components. No NVMe storage and chipsets that are considerably weaker than the A series Apple chips. There are many APIs that Apple allows into the camera and many apps that utilize it. How’s that oversaturated photo you just took? Oversaturated? Well I guess the cameras suck on Android devices as well. How’s that software update you’ll never get? Nougat is out and most Android devices won’t see it for years if at all. Wait, didn’t Apple just break a record for the December quarter and muster more activations than anyone else? Didn’t their marketshare increase globally? Wasn’t it Apple who managed to capture %104 of mobile profits? keep digging….lol My Galaxy Prime How’s my over saturated picture look? Better than anything you can do on the iPhone especially because I can manually adjust what I want. As a matter of fact, most devices produce better photos than the iPhone. Nougat is coming in January, Samsung just finished their beta testing, Apple got more activations but fewer than last year while everyone’s rose. Damn, even with the Note 7 recall, Samsung was still able to increase activations while the iPhone saw a decrease. And Apple saw their own profits. Just because a company doesn’t make a profit it doesn’t mean another company takes it. Also, isn’t Apple’s profits falling from last year? Hell, from last quarter? Everyone else is selling more devices while Apple sells fewer. Didn’t Android gain more market share this year’s while Apple continued to lose? Docservlet iPhone manual controls were introduced in iOS 8. With the introduction of RAW photos, Apple has opened APIs to even more controls. That’s literally how far behind you are. As a matter of fact, the iPhone still achieves some of the highest rated photos of any device. Nougat is coming in January??? LOLOLOL! Golf clap. While you fandroids have fragmentation up the wazoo, iPhone has achieved an incredible 63% adoption of iOS 10. How does that compare to the 1% of android nougat adoption. Hasn’t Samsung’s profit been on a steady decline since 2013? As others android OEMs are pushing out cheaper and junkier phones, Samsung is unable to compete because there’s no differentiation in android. It’s a race to the bottom and the ASPs keep getting lower. All android OEMs are struggling and companies like Le Eco are packing it up and going bankrupt. Meanwhile, Apple keeps earning more and more from record launches like the iPhone 7 and laptops and services and blockbuster product releases like AirPods. All the while Samsung is playing catch up. LOL My Galaxy Prime The iPhone camera has manual control? Yup, you’re dumber than a wall. Good-bye Docservlet LOL!!!! The fact that you don’t know this speaks volumes for your ignorance. Get lost before you embarrass yourself even more. My Galaxy Prime lol manual exposure, self timer, and time lapse are the manual modes you’re referring to? Speak to me when you can manually adjust focus, white balance, the ISO, and shutter speed. lol the iphone camera doesn’t have manual mode. it’s auto mode with the ability to change the exposure. Might I add, Android devices, including my S7, all come with manual exposure, a self timer, and time lapse. The fact that you don’t know what manual mode continues to reinforce how little you actually know not only about Android devices but the device you carry around with you as well. You can’t do this with your iPhone’s camera app www digitaltrends com/mobile/how-to-use-pro-mode-samsung-galaxy-s7/2/ Docservlet LOL! Are you seriously that clueless? Speak to me when you find your brain. the Focus app takes full advantage of manual features such as shutter speed, white balance and ISO and where it really shines is in its manual focus control. Manual app is super simple to use and lets you adjust shutter, ISO, white balance, focus, and exposure compensation. In a single tap you can also view aperture settings, making Manual a straight-forward and user friendly photography tool. ProCam 2 combines great tools with a great layout. Controls include manual focus, exposure compensation, shutter speed, ISO, and white balance. The fact that you’re a complete clueless idiot reinforces my perception of your stupidity. The fact that you are so clueless that you stand on something that has been available for some time speaks to your considerable mental challenges. My Galaxy Prime So you need to download multiple apps to do what the S7 can do out of the box? Your iPhone is so cool. Docservlet Oh no!!! You mean I need to download multiple apps to get something like iMessage and FaceTime? How bout the fact that you were completely wrong about manual controls? LOLOLOLOL. You clueless trolls. My Galaxy Prime I can text message and video chat out of the box too. Lol they’re baked in features. ROTF really? Just because they’re called iMessage and FaceTime doesn’t make them revolutionary. It’s texting and video chatting. Lol no need to download anything. I can already do it. Docservlet Text message? Is that the same as iMessage? LOLOLOLOL!!! LMFAO! Are you that delusional as to what iMessage is? FaceTime is the same as video chat? Holy smokes. You fandroids sure know how to stretch. Not to mention Continuity, Hand Off, iWork etc etc is baked in. There is no Continuity or Hand Off equivalent in Android. You have to download the junk Google Docs from the Play Store. LOL! Your monkey-like tap dancing is becoming hilarious. My Galaxy Prime So to use iMessage, you don’t communicate with others through their phone number? Isn’t that exactly how text messaging works? And Facetime is video chatting. What do you do on facetime? Chat over video. really? I can download airdroid and get my messages on my Mac, I can be on a website on my device and continue where I left off with Chrome, and Google Docs actually comes pre-installed. I never said any of these were baked in. I said we have alternatives that offer the same or better experiences. The manual controls I said were baked in. You keep mentioning these services…like ALOT. Almost like these are the only things the iPhone can do. Is there anything else special beyond Continuity, Hand off, and iWork? lol who even mentions iWork when speaking about Docs and Office? lol iWork is so great that Apple bundled it into MacOS Sierra. Nope, they didn’t. How great is iWork when Apple doesn’t even bother to bundle it into their newest OS? Docservlet So to get messages on your Mac you have to download airdroid? And then you have to download Chrome? Interestingly Google Docs was not preinstalled on my S7. What is it you do with iMessage? Send full resolution photos, videos, documents, and practically every other attachment that fails to send with regular text messages. Not to mention iMessage apps that further enhance those capabilities. What do you do on video chat? You mean like downloading a separate app and hoping they have a social media account.If they value their privacy, that’s a non starter. Not to mention the complete seamless transition on iPhones between voice and video calls. Airdroid is a joke. How do I get my text messages on my tablet? How do I get my text messages on my other iPhones or Macs? I don’t. How do I answer a call from my Mac, iPad or Apple Watch? I don’t. You simply don’t even have the basic knowledge of what continuity and hand off really are. iWork was included on my iPhone, iPad, and new TouchBar MacBook Pro. Yes they did. Have you seen all the bad reviews for Google Docs? It’s miserable outdated and ugly interface. It consistently rates bottom in capabilities in professional reviews. Google users don’t like the software and professionals pan it as garbage. You keep exposing your ignorance with every post. My Galaxy Prime As an Android user, to get messages on a device that doesn’t support anything outside of the Apple ecosystem, do I need to download an app? Of course. What type of dumb question is that? Its one thing when your device needs developers to create an experience others get out of the box. it’s another when you need developers to create a connection with another device because a company refuses it. Video chat is built in. See that green thing that looks like a camera? If you actually had an S7, you would know. How do I answer a phone call on my Mac using a device Apple refuses to connect with? I don’t. I use my phone. How do I answer a call on my Gear S3? Well, I can either use the 3G service that’s built in or connect it through bluetooth. Dude, I’ve told you that I know what hand off and continuity are. Are these the only things you know that the iPhone can do? iWork is split into 3 apps, Pages, Numbers, and Keynote. I just looked at the reviews for Docs, Slides and Sheets and they all have more positive reviews than negative. Where did you get your info from? You get your news from the same source as Trump. I found this little article when comparing iWork to Docs. The title of the article says it all. www digitaltrends com/computing/apple-iwork-collaboration/ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4c996e05b3c5b12d8c771f8d84c8a8de7f8918382adfa483ab2e59b9ec1d3b9a.jpg Docservlet LOL! So I need to download software that Apple provides out of the box to experience iMessage and Continuity and Hand Off etc etc etc. And Google Docs isn’t included on my device so I have to download that too???? And I have to download AirDroid??? LOLOL! It wasn’t an actual question imbecile. I was mocking you. See that green light that indicates video. It’s a carrier enabled feature and it’s device dependent. FaceTime was introduced in 2010 and has been ubiquitous on all iPhones since then. How bout the fact that you can’t answer calls on your tablet or Laptop? LOLOLOL!!! Keep dancing. Dude, it’s obvious you don’t understand what hand off and continuity are. You’re so vacuous in your rambling and tap dancing that your actually forgetting what you’re writing. LOL!!! Not to mention the fact that ratings and reviews for iWork have consistently outranked Google Docs. It’s amazing the level of ignorance you display. My Galaxy Prime 88 1 star ratings for pages? ouch! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/450315ff2f89447afa45386679e1a7bcd31bfba510b382cc37bab1e341ff87d9.png Docservlet 32,000 one star ratings for Google Docs. Ouch. My Galaxy Prime You can 100% see the difference Docservlet LOL…only in your dreams. My Galaxy Prime You are aware that it is very possible to take an iPhone and a Galaxy device, put on the same YouTube video and compare the content right? My brother has an iPhone 6s. I have, in front of him, compared the screens. Now, since his device has a max resolution of 750p, the resolution on YouTube could only go up to 720p. However, for the S7, the resolution can get bumped to 2K. So do I see a clear difference between 720 and 2K? Yes. And is that really your educated and well thought-out argument for there not being a difference in screen quality between the 2 devices? Docservlet You know I own a Samsung S7 right? Now, since the human eye CANNOT distinguish pixels on my iPhone 7 Plus and S7 Edge mobile displays at those resolution it’s another predictable case of fandroidism. On my S7, there are no more or fewer pixels on the screen. There is a distinct yellow tint to the S7. There are more vibrant colors on the S7. The iPhone has brighter whites. As far as educated response, I already know the kind of insecure fandroid I’m dealing with. My Galaxy Prime I’m not insecure. I’m telling you that you’re wrong. Even at 1080p, there is a difference. You don’t need to see individual pixels to notice it. How, oh how, is this common knowledge online and you still can wrap you’re head around it. It is well known that Galaxy devices have better screens and pictures than their iPhone counterparts. Seriously, when was the last time you ever head someone, besides you, say that the iPhone has a better screen than a Galaxy device. Hell, if the iPhone’s screens were so great, they wouldn’t be buying panels from Samsung. Lol they wouldn’t be switching from LCD to OLED. If Apple’s screens are so great, why then switch to “inferior” hardware? And that’s cool to own an S7. I own a Mac. That doesn’t make you any less wrong. Docservlet LOL!!! It’s common knowledge that YOU CANNOT SEE PIXELS. You can see differences in display type and quality. How are you attempting to defy the laws of human biology. It is not well know that Galaxy users have better screens. The head of DisplayMate himself said there are benefits to both AMOLED and LCD and ranked them as nearly equal. AMOLED is newer but also has many many drawbacks. So you mean, if iPhone switches to newer display technology that buying them from Samsung is somehow a massive change? Ridiculous and childish statement. iPhone 7 achieved the highest color accuracy, peak brightness, and contrast rating in bright light of any smartphone display, the highest contrast ratio of any IPS LCD display, and the lowest screen reflectance of any smartphone display. So given that it achieves such exceptional displays performance your point is moot. NO ONE SAID that AMOLED is inferior. Apple doesn’t make screens. It buys them from Sharp and LG. Now it’s SPECULATED that it may be buying AMOLED. If they’ve sorted out burn in, graphics performance issues, yellowish tinting, and dead pixels, then hopefully the transition will not be so painful. As it stands, OLED is not that great a technology. Rowan09 Why not 8K? A small screen won’t benefit from such high resolution and Sony found that out the hard way. It’s just not worth the battery life for marginal differences. jOn Garrett VR Docservlet Gimmick jOn Garrett First off, Samsung has no 4k phone. Second Samsung has VR headsets–try using one on your sh’!ty 720p LED display then try again on 2k or 4k AMOLED then come back here and tell us again about overkill. Docservlet VR is nonsense. Who wants to put a ridiculous piece of junk over their eyes? For what????? If I want VR, I’ll get it on my Playtstion and not on my phone. Snailpo I do.. my and my family absolutely love the VR experience. It is a cheap way to have a great time! Just because your iPhone doesn’t have it doesn’t mean it’s useless or pointless… apple doesn’t even give you the option. You don’t HAVE to use it on Samsung, but you can if you want to. Docservlet I don’t. I’m not going to sit there with some ridiculous headset bandaged to my head and pretend to be doing something. No one cares about it because no one uses it. It’s a gimmick just like all the hand waving and face unlocking nonsense. My Galaxy Prime I use my vr headset to play games, watch movies, visit interactive places around and outside of the globe. Had you actually used one, you would see a benefit. Hell, play EVE GunJack, Temple run, smash hit, or End Space and it’ll make you rethink the way you play games. VR is not a gimmick. This is why companies are investing billions in the platform. You’re arguing without a platform to stand on. How can you honestly say something isn’t good when you haven’t even given it a chance? Because other people said so? You can’t think for yourself and come up with your own conclusion? Docservlet This is the same ridiculous and idiotic argument you fandroids make for features like wireless charging. No one is breaking down the door to get wireless charging. No one is going to buy the ridiculous VR garbage and stick their phone on their face. Or maybe some fandroids will. Features like Continuity, Hand Off, iMessage, FaceTime, iWork, etc etc all make android features like VR look lame and pathetic. My Galaxy Prime Doesn’t Apple’s new earpods and watch both charge wirelessly? Apple just had a patent approved for wireless charging. This was like, a month ago. Lol Apple is breaking down doors to get wireless charging. Have you seen the number of patients they have on wireless charging alone? They have patents dating back years. How do you not even know what Apple is working on but still feel like you know everything? The Gear VR was just ranked 3 on Amazon’s best selling wearables so people are actually buying these ridiculous garbage headsets. But yes, only Android users can buy VR headsets because Apple doesn’t offer anything in this space. And every iOS feature you mentioned are available in some fashion for Android. iWork, iMessage, and FaceTime…Google Docs/ MS office, WhatsApp/ Facebook Messenger, Skype. So we get everything that Apple has plus VR? That seems like a better option. Docservlet Of course they both charge wirelessly and who cares? I had wireless charging in 2009 on my palm Pre. It didn’t make the phone any faster or make HP suck any less. Apple is not breaking anything down. If you had a couple of brain cells, you’d know that induction charging is THE least technical technology. It’s literally 50 cents worth of induction magnets. The Gear VR….you mean literally a set of goggles you strap to your head like some kid? What happens when I get a phone call or text? LOLOLOL! But yes…only android users are childish enough to use VR headsets. Android has no equivalent to iMessage, iWork, FaceTime nor Continuity or Hand Off. You actually don’t get it which isn’t surprising. My Galaxy Prime Did your Palm come with fast wireless charging? No? OK. My S7 does so it actually does make my device faster…Well, charge faster. Wireless charging on my S7 is still faster than wired charging on an iPhone even though the iPhone has a smaller battery. And spending millions on R&D so Apple can most likely create a wireless charging alternative that only works with the iPhone (because Apple) seems like breaking down doors. I mean, when have you personally spent millions on something you didn’t care about? When have you hired experts and professionals for no reason? Wireless charging is important to many but you’ll agree once Apple has a charging pad for you to buy. And yes, a VR headset is something you strap to your head. Sort of like glasses but I can only imagine how stupid you think glasses are. And when you get a text or a call, a notification appears on the screen. Lol your experience doesn’t just shut down. Dude, you seriously haven’t used it but feel the need to comment like an expert? Had you even used the headset, you would have the answer to that question. Don’t waste my time with this nonsense. Why am I sitting here having a discussion with someone who literally has no idea what they’re saying. You don’t know that Apple is investing in Wireless technology. You don’t know that more companies are investing in VR and that the Gear VR sold very well this holiday season. You don’t know that Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Allo, Skype, Duo, Office, Google Docs, AirDroid, and Chrome are all alternatives to the apps you just mentioned. Lol you think no one on Android is texting because we don’t have iMessage? Really? iMessage borrowed so many of their new features from Allo, WhatsApp, and WeChat. Lol what, you didn’t know that either? Docservlet Did my Palm come with wireless charging? Yes. Does my S7 come with wireless charging? Yes. Oh cool….now it charges faster???? BFD!!!! Wireless charging with a 2 amp charger on the S7 is roughly 20 minutes faster than the iPhone with a 2 amp charger. Apple can spend 50 cents on a couple of contacts for the back of the iPhone 7 and a two dollars for a base and call it a day. This is not revolutionary technology. Wireless charging is GARBAGE tech. Wireless charging is important only to fandroids because it’s the only leg they have to stand on. Apple has thousands of engineers. LOL….you still don’t get it. None of those is like Continuity, Hand Off, iMessage, FaceTime, iWork etc. Allo isn’t used by anyone. WhatsApp is a minor alternative but what about regular texting? Which 99% of the world seems to do? You actually have no idea what you’re talking about do you. You’re so behind on the actual technology that you’re just offering Apps. My Galaxy Prime Did your Palm come with FAST wireless charging. You missed the word fast which makes your 1st 4 sentences stupid. Why do you keep saying wireless charging is only important to us when Apple is also spending millions on wireless charging? That’s stupid. You’re ignoring fact to support your dumbass claim. And sure, Apple CAN spend the money but they haven’t. Instead, they’re taking that 50 cents and churning out new patents for wireless charging lol. WhatsApp is a minor alternative? Most of the world uses WhatsApp. And WhatsApp is a TEXT APP. If you have a phone number, you can use it. Do you not know how WhatApp works? I’m done. Rowan09 What’s features did iMessage borrow from Allo? iMessage is way better than anything Google has or tried they were and are all failures. They tried but to force me to use boy I forgot the name to respond on YouTube because they purposely make YouTube messaging system horrible. Continuity is an Apple thing. I could go down a list of things Apple does better and things Google does better, but overall Apple is better in my opinion. Everyone brags about Android being open source when ever since they first made Android they have more closed source apps than Apple. The OS is still open but if you are going to use Google services your stuck to strict Google rules which is no different than Apple really. Both OSes are great but can you tell me why can’t S7 Edge see a tracking number as a tracking number? On my iPhone I click on a tracking and it brings me to the respective page, on Android nothing I have to copy and paste. Simple things like this in my opinion makes IOS better than Android. I love Android as well though because I make a killing off Fire Sticks/Fire TVs. My Galaxy Prime Google that question. Rowan09 Nope I’ll use Bing. Rowan09 They make VR headers for every platform man. Wireless charging on the S7 Edge which I also own is a gimmick. Why do I need to put my phone on a pad and when it rings I have to pick it up? Apple is suppose to be working on true wireless meaning no pad and that would be great. The Apple Watch and Airpods needs wireless charging because they are small devices. My wife has a Gear watch and she has to try her best to just plug in the charger. Watches and small devices benefit from wireless pads not cellphones. Plus every phone has cases for wireless charging as well. jOn Garrett Gunjack is amazing. Imagine what VR games will look like in a few short years from now. My Galaxy Prime I can’t wait to play Call of Duty in VR Rowan09 Come on man VR is obsolutely a gimmick on the Samsung VR because the quality is garbage. I use the a PlayStation VR and that’s a great experience. I didn’t try the Vive or Oculus which is the best. I own the VR headset and it sucks I don’t even use it anymore. I’m watching Netflix in 480P on that thing. Snailpo Ridiculous gimmick? I’m sorry that you have no benefit or enjoyment for it. You don’t have to use it. That is the joy in Samsung, it’s there if you want to and a lot of people want to! Docservlet LOL…you have no benefit for faster processors, faster storage, better ecosystem, continuity, hand off etc etc etc. Samsung is a joke. Rowan09 Umm you can use VR headset for any device including the iPhone, they come a dime a dozen. Right now VR is just a hype it’s not ready and the Samsung VR is the worst. I would know since I’ve had it with a S7 Edge since day 1. Snailpo I have had the Samsung since day one as well. As well as an iPhone 7 since day one. The Vr experience combined with oculus is the best experience I’ve had. I can stream my PC games to it and use a controller and it works flawlessly. Rowan09 What VR experience on the Samsung VR or the Oculus Rift? Snailpo On the Samsung VR you can stream any PC video game to it, it’s a blast! Not quite as good as an actual oculus rift, but it’s damn close for only 100 bucks lol Rowan09 Come on man it’s not close. The viewing quality is what kills the experience for me and the headset is not comfortable. Did you use the Oculus Rift (I didn’t)? I used the Playstation VR and it was great and comfortable and had a chance to try the Vive but didn’t try it. VR is not the future AR is the future. I would like the try the new Google VR to see if it’s any better viewing wise than the Samsung VR. There are many other VR headsets that does the same as Samsung VR for a fraction of the price. george Until Apple makes one and then you call it revolutionary. Pathetic. Docservlet Idiotic. Until your phone gets features like continuity, Hand off, iWork, iCloud, etc etc etc, your phone is garbage. Fandroids are Pathetic insecure idiots. Snailpo You say that all these points that Samsung has other better things than apple are “pointless” it may be pointless to you and you may not need it, but at least I still have it and I can still do it. Whether my screen resolution is triple iPhone or not, I still have a display that is drop dead stunning, or if I have a VR experience, whether I use it or not I still at least have the option of being able to use it. That is the difference between Apple an android Docservlet I have Continuity, Hand Off, dual Camera, Touch ID, 3D Touch, the FASTEST Smartphone Storage on the planet, the A10 fusion chip which obliterates other mobile processors and allows for faster video editing and load times, optical zoom etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc. I’m sure you clueless fandroids will consider it useless but Apple offers them. Whether Samsung’s phone offers a display that is pretty much on par with Apple’s is fine. The fact that you have pointless VR experiences is pointless. Whether or not you use those gimmicks while losing everything else is a hilarious comparison. Snailpo Funny you say all the things that android has as well. Also it’s funny that you say half of the stuff that android has is useless, but half the stuff you just named off is in that same category… but at least you can say you have it. Can’t call me an android fan boy if I use both play forms religiously. I just think Apple holds back way more than they really should. I want stuff in my phone that I don’t necessarily need, because even if I use it once and think it was cool I still had the choice to use it Docservlet Funny, I say all the things Android DOESN’T have. Rowan09 Let me guess when Apple made Touch ID wasn’t it revolutionary? When Apple finally releases something it’s usually a big deal and works different usually better than anything else on the market. Apple is rarely ever first, besides the gimmick of 64Bit processor according to android fans. george I’m talking about VR which he said is stupid. Rowan09 The Samsung VR is garbage. Sony VR is great, Vive I heard was better and Oculus the best. george He’s not talking about quality he’s talking about putting something on your face and looking stupid. So when Apple releases the same thing I hope he says the same. Rowan09 I have the VR and S7 Edge and it is garbage. If Samsung is making a 4K phone just for VR boy oh boy that’s a bad idea. Samsung VR is by far the worst out of all the others. I know Samsung never made a 4K phone Sony did. But according to your point since VR is so important to Samsung why not make a 8K phone that would be better than 4K and sharper. John I swear VR is only good for one thing. Porn. And the only type of person that needs VR porn are losers that sit infrint if their PC all day jerking off. Waste of time. Clearly Samsung are aiming at their target audience. Lol Rowan09 I own the 7 Plus which is 1080P and I used my S7 Edge with the VR and it’s horrible. It never focuses perfectly (I have 20/20) and watching videos is far from HD. Stuart Lombard They couldn’t possibly copy the airpods because Samsung came to market with wireless earbuds before Apple. If you’re going to accuse anyone of stealing ideas, then it would have to be Apple! Rowan09 I’m assuming they are speaking of the style not just simply making wireless earphones. It’s hard to tell from the article so even if it’s like the airpods I don’t blame Samsung because it seems to be a popular device. jOn Garrett Assumptions, rumored, not even built gadget = BS you post to get page views. Docservlet Samsung is going to follow their business model of copying Apple. BS = your idiotic denial. Natalie More like Shitsung are updating there V1 wireless earbuds to match the market now. Apple released theirs a lot later so they can’t be copying. george How are they copying Apple when they already have a product line? Stupid AF article. John After they mocked apple for removing the head phone jack and making room for wireless earpods. They then do the same. Late to the party as usual. jOn Garrett How so why they had their wireless pods in stores before Apple’s was even announced? Apple is late to the missing headphone jack too since than was done starting in 2014 with the Oppo R5 followed by 4 or 5 other Android phones. Docservlet LOL… those weren’t wireless pods. Those were just stupid BT headsets. Apple is ahead of everyone. The level of technology packed into the AirPods pushed bluetooth headsets forward 5 years. Android phones are horrible and they remove headphone jacks and don’t do anything else….like function properly. MvP77 What’s the different tech in airpods? Curious icon x owner wants to know. Seriously, want to know if it’s worth grabbing them. The only thing I miss about using my icons on the my iPhone is the heart rate and workout monitor during workouts. And the ambiant noise switch. Docservlet -Charging case give me about 3 or 4 days of use before needing to recharge. -Automatic stop/start music when inserted or removed in ear -True HD voice quality during HD voice calls -WIreless range of about 100 feet in clear site -Automatic set up across all devices. Can easily switch between iPhone, Mac, Apple TV, Apple Watch. I think that covers a few. MvP77 Thanks, my icon x charging case is about the same, tho I only use them about 45mins a day for workouts. The auto start / stop seems interesting. I don’t really care about call quality. Can you turn up the volume and change tracks with them? Docservlet Only way to change volume is with phone or through Siri. I’ve not found that to be a problem since I never used it on my old bt headsets. The small controls more often resulted in hanging up calls than changing volume. MvP77 Cool, not a deal breaker. Icon X uses gestures to change volume and tracks but it takes some getting use to. I might check out the airpods or bragi dash. Docservlet Cool…ultimately fit is key. Good luck AMB_07 I do have to admit that Apple generally gets it right but they rarely get it first and to start accusing Samsung of copying them is nothing more than pure blind fanboyism. Did Samsung copy in the past? Sure, so did Apple! jOn Garrett The problem is that people enjoy accusing Samsung while Apple mostly gets a free pass. Samsung gets accused of copying Apple when Apple doesn’t even have a product on the market or when said item is already years old on other devices. Imagine what these Apple site posts would look like if Apple had made an iPhone edge in 2015 and Samsung was the one coming out with a Galaxy edge (with glass body, AMOLED display, wireless charging, dust and water resistance) AMB_07 I find some of the writers (particularly Christian here) a bit hypocritical sometimes. I remember back in the days when Samsung popularized phablets and how he and others here were bashing them for creating big phones and they kept bringing back Steve Jobs’ quote about ”if you see a stylus, they blew it”. Yet when Apple made not only a bigger iPhone (which nobody thought was a bad idea) but also a phablet version suddenly it all made sense and this is Apple reacting in a smart way to how the market is shifting. Which isn’t false but still hypocritical. Also, Apple pen. The fact is that both Samsung and Apple will take ideas from each others in order to be one step ahead of the other and Apple has copied tons from Android and vice-versa (although I feel Android copied a little less). John You miss the point. Samsung mock and then copy. They are ultimatly a parasitic company that piggy backs on everyone elses success whilst claiming they innovate. jOn Garrett Mock and copy? Didn’t Jobs say no one wants a hummer sized phone? Didn’t he also say that 7″ tablets were too small to be useful? Didn’t Jobs and Cook mock the S pen? Yet here we are with Apple selling an iPhone that’s bigger than the Note, 7″ tablets and an apple pencil. Apple stole Sony’s design for the iPhone 4 Apple stole slide to unlock Apple even stole the iPhone name. So tell me again about a mocking parasite. My Galaxy Prime Samsung 100% released wireless earpods before Apple, yet they’re copying? If they release new earpods it’s because it’s an update to what is alreadt out. People need to stop getting tech news from those who can’t see beyond a bitten fruit. Crim Nino Correct me if I’m wrong but didn’t the mainstream market bash apple for this? I’m shocked how nobody made any comments about samsung confirming getting rid of the 3.5 headphone jack in favor of all wireless head phones something that was bashed during iPhone 7 launch. So when apple does it then it’s bad but when others copy apple doing it then it’s ok??? Apple got bashed for a non removable battery then others followed. Apple is a trend setter. Rowan09 Absolutely. Apple is number 1 in popularity and sales so other companies look and see what they are doing and follow. Crim Nino I remember how the CEO of Samsung bashed Apple for going 64 bit (first mobile phone) then Samsung went 64 bit Rowan09 Oh yes and all the fandroids said it’s useless and now every phone is 64 bit.
