Opinion What Samsung expects from iPhone 8 Samsung works pretty hard to make sure its products offer more or less the same features as Apple's iPhone, so the rumors speak volumes here.

The explosive Apple/Samsung relationship lacks romance but has launched over a billion smartphones all the same. One way Samsung tries to compete is to match the iPhone rumors with the features of its own flagship phones, which it rushes to market to remain competitive. In my opinion this means that when we look at what Samsung is expected to ship we are also looking at what Samsung thinks Apple may be working on. Given both firms have connections across each other’s supply chains, I think it’s a supportable theory. What are Samsung’s plans? The Samsung v. Apple struggle is good for consumers (other than when devices are rushed to market in order to explode), but it also means that when you look at the rumors you’re also getting a good insight into what Samsung thinks the next iPhone will look like. So, what are people predicting? A quick scout around the Web gave me: Ultra HD display (2K in S8 series smartphones) Faster processor VR capabilities, and a new Samsung Gear VR wearable. Note S Stylus support in Galaxy S8 Curved edge AMOLED display Dual lens camera for high end device (Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus?) IP86 certified, dust proof and water resistant No headphone jack Wireless charging Available in gold, silver, black, and blue. Samsung will also introduce its recently acquired Bixby virtual assistant in its high end Note and S8 phones. Bixby was created by Siri developers, Viv Labs, and is just part of the company’s focus on Artificial Intelligence. "Samsung is setting its sights on becoming a major player in software and services, and specifically AI, Viv Labs CEO Dag Kittlaus told the Express. "You will soon come to see the utter seriousness of Samsung’s intentions. And like us, they aim to win." What are Apple’s plans? Samsung may well be playing to “win”, but so is Apple. It is doubtful both firms share the same vision of victory. Samsung focuses on selling vast quantities of product at low profit margins, while Apple’s business plan is to sell vast quantities of product at more sustainable profit margins*. (*Apple’s plan appears to be changing – in future it hopes to build business value through attachment of services, which is something its biggest competitor cannot match). This will be the tenth anniversary iPhone, though it isn’t known if Apple will mark it. MacRumors tells us to expect: OLED display, potentially curved Faster processor (Apple’s A-series chips are the fastest in the industry) No Home button Wireless charging with partner, Energous All glass body Waterproof No headphone jack (“Courage”) Apple Pencil support in larger model More sophisticated biometric sensors, potentially including non-invasive diabetes blood tests? Also available in white. We also expect Apple to reveal some of what it has been developing for VR/AR this year, potentially including VR glasses it has been working on for years. In other words, Samsung appears to think the iPhone will match the rumors, given the similarity of the speculations being made for future devices from both firms. One more thing Apple finds it much harder to keep secrets than it once did. Its success means it endures constant scrutiny from media, government and everybody else. It may also feel that the legal system has proved itself unable to effectively protect iPhone design patents. In order to maintain a unique market position, Apple will need to rely heavily on proprietary technologies, software, processors, component, and unique material and manufacturing processes within the tenth anniversary iPhone. It needs to weave these deep inside its new product, in order to create something that isn’t only protected by patent law, but by utility patents that protect unique and proprietary manufacturing processes. You may be able to match the design, but can you imitate the components? How else will it slow its fast follower down? Google+?

The credits do boast of a super line up with Fassbender, Marion Cotillard, Jeremy Irons, Brendan Gleeson, Charlotte Rampling, Ariane Labed and Michael K. Williams… but the culmination leaves a few things to be desired. Tortured by the death of his mother Callum Lynch (Michael Fassbender) has spent the last 30 years running away from his nightmares; he has led a life a of crime, and finally his sins catch up he finds himself on the death row, charged with the murder of a man who tried to mug him. Callum is strapped to the seat and administered a lethal dose, but he wakes up one fine morning completely free from his shackles to find out that he had been given a second chance at life… at a price. Callum’s saviour is none other than Alan Rikkin (irons) the ‘visionary’ CEO of Absetrgo Industries, which is actually the modern day embodiment of the Templar order. Rikkin hires Lynch to enter an experimental research project called the Animus project to locate the Apple of Eden created by an ancient civilization; the Apple contains the genetic codes for free will and the magnanimous  Rikkin believes that it will help eradicate a virus that is plaguing mankind. The company’s head scientist Sophia Rikkin (Alan’s daughter) reveals that Lynch is in fact a descendent of Aguilar (also played by Fassbender) and she hooks him up with a machine to revive Aguilar’s memories in order to locate the Apple. The plot moves with many twists and turns as we are made aware of the façade maintained by Abstergo Industries, but underneath the layers of marketing brilliance lies a very ordinary, albeit hackneyed theme of an unlikely hero fighting for justice. The movie is somewhat theatrical in its approach and yet we feel a sense of ‘been there seen that’ with it; the actions sequences are well shot, but appear too much like the Matrix trilogy. The director appears to have tried to please a majority of the audience, and as a result the film has lost a sense of individuality. The art direction is stunning however, and the audience will find it easier to immerse themselves in the ‘period’ tone of the movie. The characters are fairly commonplace; Fassbender and co. do justice to their roles but their performances are largely hindered by the lacklustre script. In a movie that thrives on past occurrences, we learn very little of the characters themselves. Fassbender gets the most screen space as Callum and Aguilar, with very little to separate them one from the other. Callum is perhaps the more selfish of the two characters as he has committed murder for personal gain, whereas Aguilar committed crimes for the benefit of all humanity. Nonetheless Fassbender plays both with a sense of brooding tension – there is something very Shakespearean about his approach to characterisation. He is effective but unable to give a truly nuanced performance due to the limitations of the script. Cotillard is refreshing (as always) as Sophia. Her character is best written out of all, and the actress embodies the grey area of Sophia’s personality with much class. The ensemble cast delivers well, although some of them are wasted in their roles. Assassin’s Creed is a movie that contains much that is good and bad; it is well directed and the CGI graphics are breathtaking… but the movie suffers from a lack of originality. Nonetheless it is a film that can be enjoyed, if only for the action sequences and characterisation. Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

It’s not. It’s cool though, AirBar has you covered — at least if you’re a MacBook Air user. What is it? “The most awesome stage” Last year, Facebook's VP of Design thought the TNW Conference main stage was the best she'd ever been on. FIND OUT WHY AirBar is a tiny strip that plugs into the USB port on your PC (now including the MacBook Air) and turns non-touch displays into touch-friendly devices. To accomplish this, the plug-in device uses magnets to attach to the bottom of your screen and emit an invisible light field over the monitor. This light field measures finger position to act as a sort of hacked touchscreen and gesture control center for non-touch friendly devices. It feels natural, and there wasn’t any discernible lag in the demo model at CES. According to AirBar Senior Vice President Remo Behdasht: We believe the community of devoted MacBook Air users will welcome this new prod- uct, as AirBar for MacBook Air will surely enhance the user-experience of an already great product. Our goal for AirBar continues to be expanding its application to more devices, across even more markets. Why does it matter? These days, computing power isn’t progressing as fast as it used to, and users are holding on to older laptops longer than ever before. If moving to a touchscreen device is your only reason for upgrading, AirBar makes a lot more sense. When is it coming? It’s here. AirBar for Windows has been around since the beginning of last month, while the MacBook Air version was just announced prior to CES. Both are available to order on the Neonode website for $69. Just allow four to five weeks for shipping. For more CES 2017 news from TNW, check out our event page here, and follow us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat.

Credit: Thinkstock More like this Both Apple and Microsoft take tumble in Gartner's latest device forecast PC shipments predicted to return to growth in 2018 after six-year skid Windows comes up third in OS clash two years early Video Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana Apple will steal a march on Microsoft this year when for the first time this century shipments of devices powered by its operating systems outnumber those running Windows, research firm Gartner said today. In 2017, Apple's combination of iOS and macOS -- the former on iPhones and iPads, the latter on Macs -- will take second place from Windows on the devices shipped during the year. The gap between the two will widen in 2018 and 2019, with Apple ahead of Microsoft both years. According to Gartner, which provided Computerworld with its latest device shipment forecast broken out by operating system, in 2016 Windows powered about 260 million devices of the 2.3 billion shipped during the year. Windows accounted for approximately 11.2% of the total devices, which overwhelmingly ran Google's Android. Meanwhile, iOS and macOS -- the latter was formerly dubbed OS X -- sank to 248 million devices in 2016, a 10% drop from the year prior. The cause: Slackened sales of the iPhone, Apple's dominant device and biggest money maker. Gartner predicted that iOS + macOS, unlike Windows, will recover in 2017. Apple's OSes will climb 8% to 268 million this year, add 3% in 2018 to reach 276 million, then increase another 3% in 2019, with that year's device shipment forecast at 285 million. Windows will dip this year, then stagnate for the following two years. Microsoft's operating system will power about 252 million devices shipped in 2017 -- the bulk of them personal computers -- for a year-over-year decline of 3%. Windows will account for 253 million devices in 2018 (for a near-zero growth rate) and 257 million devices in 2019 (an annual growth rate of 1.8%). The gap between Microsoft and Apple -- 12 million last year, with Microsoft atop -- will widen to 27 million by 2019, advantage Apple. Gartner's forecast was another gloomy report on almost every device category, with shipments flat this year compared to last and growth not projected until 2018. "The global devices market is stagnating," said Gartner analyst Ranjit Atwal in a statement Wednesday. Mobile phone shipments are growing only in emerging markets in the Asia and Pacific markets, Atwal added, and noted that, "The PC market is just reaching the bottom of its decline." The PC industry's troubles have affected Microsoft most of all; Windows is almost entirely dependent on PC shipments, which have been stuck in a protracted slump. Future shipments were further hit when Microsoft walked away from the smartphone business last year. Gartner pegged total shipments of PC-like devices at 268 million for 2016, a 7% contraction from the year before, and contrary to an October forecast, now says shipments would again decline in 2017, dropping 0.7% to 266 million. Circumstances will improve only marginally in the two years following, as shipments rise to 272 million in 2018 and 278 million in 2019. The new normal is a sub-300 million market. PCs will not disappear -- something some pundits fretted about as the sales and shipment downturn extended past earlier records -- but the business has been hard hit: In 2012, for instance, more than 350 million PC-like devices shipped globally. Gartner is still betting that a PC replacement cycle will boost shipments, even if only slightly. But this week's forecast -- unlike the one in October -- predicted a delayed growth. In October, Gartner had said the PC business would claw its way back into the black in 2017; this month's prognosis is that growth won't occur until 2018. Most analysts have essentially written off growth in the consumer portion of the PC market; instead, they expect that any gains will come from commercial customers, who still rely on personal computers, as they try to transition from Windows 7 to the newer Windows 10 before Microsoft retires the former in three years. Computerworld (Data: Gartner) Microsoft's decades-long operating system supremacy over Apple will end in 2017, according to Gartner Research, as iOS and macOS power more devices shipped than does Windows.

The Cupertino company could be ready to adopt indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) displays before the end of 2017. IGZO displays have been around for a few years now — Sharp was the first manufacturer to begin production of LCD panels using the technology back in 2012. Apple is thought to have used the material for the original iPad Air in November 2013. It’s long been speculated that the company would utilize IGZO in its laptops, but these rumors never came to fruition. However, there’s now word that both Sharp and Samsung could begin supplying IGZO displays to Apple as soon as the second quarter of 2017, according to a report from Mac Rumors. The company currently uses amorphous silicon panels for its MacBook Pro, but that’s apparently set to change. More: Your next laptop will have an awesome display. Here’s why IGZO is better at conducting electricity than previous technologies and is more transparent, meaning that the system’s backlight doesn’t have to work as hard to deliver a bright, clear image. As a result, IGZO panels require less power to display a picture that’s as good, if not better, than the competition. Given that Apple just committed to a major refresh of its MacBook Pro last year, it’s difficult to predict how the new IGZO display will be implemented. Its possible that the first revision of the laptop could simply feature an upgraded screen, without making any big changes to the overall design that debuted in 2016. That said, it could well be that Apple has bigger plans for the MacBook Pro this year. If the company plans to field a new version of the MacBook Pro rather than an incremental update, an IGZO display could be an attractive selling point. Also watch: Share

Many Apple Watch fans have been hoping for a slimmer form factor, while earlier rumors promised features like cellular connectivity and even a FaceTime camera. Would you buy another Apple Watch that looks the same but lasts longer in between charges? Join us in this week’s Friday Night Fight as we discuss whether Apple Watch Series 3 needs a major overhaul. Luke Dormehl: We recently heard the rumors about a new Apple Watch, set to arrive in the fall of 2017 — and while I realize it’s never good to judge things solely based on a rumor, it does sound a bit disappointing. You and I have talked previously about the fact that Apple feels like it’s dropped behind in the innovation game in the last couple of years: favoring slow, iterative improvements on its products, rather than the kind of “tear it up and start again” mentality that made it such an exciting company in the late 1990s and 2000s. The Apple Watch Series 3 is supposed to feature better battery life and performance upgrades. That’s all well and good as an iterative upgrade, but I don’t think it’s something that’s going to get skeptics interested in the device if they aren’t already. I always kept an open mind about the Apple Watch: slightly doubtful about the smartwatch form factor, but hoping that Apple had cracked the formula and could show me something I’d not thought about previously. There are, of course, the usual caveats here: a disappointing seller for Apple is a great seller by any other company’s standards, maybe Apple doesn’t expect customers to upgrade every year, yada yada yada. But if we’re entering into the third generation of Apple Watch, I feel like there should be some unique vision for what this device does that’s different from Apple’s other products — and it sure doesn’t feel that way. At this rate, it’s basically settling into being an Apple TV level of device; essentially a “nice to have” that will appeal to a select few customers, but which isn’t a priority for Apple. Maybe that’s enough, but considering that a lot was riding on the Apple Watch (not least proving that it can still launch a new category of device people will get excited about) it doesn’t sound like the company is any closer to cracking the formula than it was when the first Apple Watch came out. Killian Bell: I certainly understand some of your concerns here. Apple made significant performance and battery life improvements with Apple Watch Series 2, and I think further improving upon these things for the third-generation model is kind of pointless. Granted, battery life improvements are always welcome, and the longer I can wear my Apple Watch before I have to charge it up again, the better. But how fast does Apple Watch really need to be? It works great now, but there’s only so much we’re going to want to do with apps built for a tiny device we wear on our wrists. I would certainly prefer it if Apple focused its efforts on integrating things like 4G connectivity, and making Apple Watch much slimmer. I’m not really interested in a FaceTime camera, but that’s another upgrade I know a lot of users are crying out for. But Apple has to find the right balance. Right now, Apple Watch is probably the best it can be with the technology Apple has at its disposal. If the company was to add additional features — like those mentioned above — it has to make room for more components, and that means making Apple Watch thicker (no one wants that). Alternatively, it has to reduce the size of other internals. Now, it’s probably safe to assume most of those internals are already as small as they can be for now. The only thing Apple could shrink with ease is Apple Watch’s battery (and no one wants that, either). So, it seems Apple is stuck between a rock and a hard place. There’s only so much it can do with Apple Watch right now, and while its existing design might be getting a little old, Apple isn’t going to change it just for the sake of change. Apple doesn’t overhaul its hardware unless there’s good reason for it. With the exception of the iPhone, which has traditionally received a new design every two years, Apple’s products typically carry the same look for several years. The iPad Air series (and now the 9.7-inch iPad Pro) has looked the same for over three years. The iMac hasn’t changed in over four. Apple doesn’t invest in new designs unless there’s good reason for it. Luke: But wait, aren’t you arguing that it wouldn’t be disappointing if this turns out to be the next Apple Watch? In terms of changing the Apple Watch by, say, making it round or thinner is a very subjective discussion, but features like making it iPhone independent — or having a proper use-case for it should be things we should have by the time a third-generation product ships. Personally, I think the Apple Watch was the wrong direction for Apple to go in altogether. For me, the best case scenario for it is that it winds up being what the Newton MessagePad was: an ahead-of-its-time product which paved the way for a genuinely great product Apple shipped 15 years later. It certainly doesn’t seem like Apple has a whole lot of vision for what this can be, besides a shrunk-down iPhone for your wrist. Judging by the bored reaction from watchOS developers, it certainly doesn’t seem like it’s struck much of a chord with them, either, as far as compelling use cases go. The Watch feels more and more like a market Apple felt it had to try and compete in, rather than one it wanted to compete in. Yes, I don’t doubt that Jony Ive likes the idea of entering the luxury goods watch market, but for your average customer, I don’t think this has been an exciting product. If the reports of shrinking customer interest in smartwatches are accurate, then I don’t think this rumored Apple Watch Series 3 is likely to change people’s minds. Do you? Killian: I’m not saying I won’t be a little disappointed, but I think it’s unrealistic to expect major changes just yet. Like I said, adding new components means making sacrifices — like cutting battery life — and we know Apple isn’t going to make them just to add a new feature to a product sheet. I don’t believe the features you’ve mentioned are things we should have by the time Apple Watch Series 3 arrives. We’re not entitled to anything, and no one is forcing us to upgrade to the next model. Like I said, there’s only so much Apple can do with the technology available. I don’t agree Apple Watch was the wrong direction to go in, either. I think Apple needed to have a presence in the smartwatch market. When Android Wear first debuted, consumers suddenly became excited about wearables, and I know several people who swapped their iPhone for an Android device just so that they could own a smartwatch. I certainly don’t think a large percentage of people were doing that, but still, Apple needed to compete. I do agree, however, that Apple probably doesn’t know what to do with Apple Watch just yet — and that’s because no one knows what to do with smartwatches right now. None of them have changed significantly in recent years, and they’re still devices that are nice to have, but aren’t necessary. Apple is doing more than most, though — especially when it comes to health and fitness. Maybe smartwatches will never become a necessity, but that doesn’t mean Apple should stop making them. Apple Watch seems to be selling very well — no other smartwatch comes close — and although you claim developers are bored, there’s an incredibly large catalog of excellent watchOS apps that’s growing every day. So they’re still supporting it. If Apple was to give up on Apple Watch just because it’s not quite sure what to do with it yet, surely it should also give up on iPad, iPod, Mac mini, and Apple TV? None of these things have changed significantly in recent years; they’re just getting incremental upgrades to keep sales ticking over while Apple thinks up something revolutionary. Luke: The trouble with what you’re saying is that the whole point of Apple being the size that it is is that it doesn’t, or shouldn’t, need to compete in a market just because other people are doing so. Others have been making VR headsets for a while now, and Apple’s yet to come out with its own version of Oculus Rift. Increasingly the watch feels, for Tim Cook, what the Newton was for John Sculley: a device to try and prove can follow what Steve Jobs did and prove that Apple’s still innovative. The difference is that the Newton turned out to be way ahead of what the competition was doing, while the Apple Watch is keeping pace with an ailing product category. I really want to like the Apple Watch. As smart homes mature, who knows, maybe this will become the perfect control mechanism by which we control our devices. Maybe Apple will eventually get it classified as a medical device and come up with smart sensors which could make this a useful diagnostic tool, subsidized by more insurance companies. But right now it’s none of those things — and the best defense I’ve ever had is from people like yourself who effectively argue “well, it wasn’t meant to be all that great.” But maybe I’m wrong. So let’s turn it over to readers. Are you excited about the new Apple Watch? What would get you to buy an Apple Watch Series 3? Leave your comments below — and have a great weekend. Friday Night Fights is a series of weekly death matches between two no-mercy brawlers who will fight to the death — or at least agree to disagree — about which is better: Apple or Google, iOS or Android? Leave a comment Deals of the Day See all deals RF9 Samsung Gear S3 looks really nice. The rotating bezel seems more innovative as a user interface than the crown. They also have LTE integrated and a 4-day battery life (presumably without LTE.) Honestly I’m jealous and tempted. I love my Apple Watch Series 2, but it seems like they can do “better” than just performance and battery life. If they can at least get to an always-on screen option and/or longer battery life, that would be helpful. It already has about two-days of battery for me (even with workouts.) I would really like to see it get LTE (or 3G) connectivity like Gear S3 or LG Urbane. Jeremy Vaughn I’ve generated $84 ,000 right now now working over the internet moreover I’m a full time student .

Here’s everything I do>>> FL-Y.COM/3kz0 David Starry I have read many reviews of the watch. I feel, not unlike many of the comments presented here that they are too overreaching and are in line with the fud that is generally generated around Apple products and its stock value. Batteries in all devices have been complained about since the beginning so it just seem silly to include them. The watch has delivered on what Tim Cook said it was for, to keep the phone out of my hands. I measure my phones battery life now in days and not hours due to the watch. Given it is still a young product category I can’t imagine how fast its maturity is supposed to be measured. Criticizing its grow without something to measure it by seems to be moot at this point. Removing the fud would be a nice place to start disguising its potential. I have read and imagined its health benefits like contacting emergency help for a heart attack. Being able to carry your own health records with you at all times. Given how long it takes to get a product to market I can just image what they are working on today that we won’t see for several more years. Trying to keep it simple to use must be the most frustrating part of developing, same with the iPhone. I see people fumbling around with their android phones everyday because it has so many options its gets confusing. I have tried to teach people how to use a computer for a long time but it is just too confusing for most people unless its for a job, well even then. Steve Jobs made it possible for everyday people to learn how to use a computer easily. I feel this is key to how and when the watch gets more features. Maybe they are aiming at security features of use for the watch. A dive computer. Overall I am very satisfied with the watch and what it can do for me today. Thank you for the discussion. devjah Hope they’re not adding FaceTime camera. If I’m going to FaceTime, I’m not gonna do this on my watch. WTF disqus_YEXmx1H3xe Top end watches don’t need to be upgraded all that often. My last watch was a Tag and I wore it for 15 years. When Apple comes out with a big innovation, I’ll probably be compelled to replace my Watch. Until then, I am quite happy with my original Watch. It does everything Apple said it would and pushes me to get a lot more exercise than my Tag did. In short, step by step innovation gets more people hooked and then a big change pushes us all to replace the one we have already bought. I would love to see more accurate sensors, wireless charging that allows it to charge while I’m wearing it, etc.Still, it does exactly what I bought it for and I will continue using it until a new feature is worth the retail price to me. wakeupmymac Meh Surprised that no one mentioned an edge to edge screen. For me the interface is too clumsy, taps, swipes etc aren’t registered properly making the simplest tasks frustrating. Often it is still easier for me to go find my phone. At the moment, for me at least, it is nothing more than a glorified step counter and occasional heart rate monitor. Josh Turiel With Series 2, it’s a good device that checks all the boxes to be a solid watch. The price is reasonable for a nice mechanical watch (it isn’t, and never will be, anything like a competitor for the $50 Timex or Casio). It is stylish enough to not be super dorky like most smartwatches are so far. It’s waterproof. The battery life is finally at the point where a normal person could not charge it one night and still be able to use it the next day. The functionality is great as it stands just on notification management and fitness alone. Not that it can’t improve more over time, but a watch is what it is, and there’s only so much you can cram into that form factor. I’m happy with my Series 2, my family enjoys their 1st gen watches, and I don’t think there’s any good reason to upgrade annually. Every few years is fine for a device like this. I don’t really care about cellular connectivity, either. Just increase battery life each generation and I’ll be happy, along with a little bit of styling updating once in a while. I’m sure there will be some new functionality as time goes by but I honestly can’t think of anything I want that isn’t already there. I don’t want a cell phone on my wrist. I just want a smart watch. Adrian Agreed–notifications and fitness mean that this watch is worth it. All I need when I upgrade from Series 2 to maybe Series 4 is better battery life, perhaps with the distance charging that Apple is supposedly working on (according to the TWiT podcast this last week) — maybe it’ll be charging while I’m sleeping and it’s collecting sleep data. For me this thing on my wrist as magical as my phone, as long as I know that it’s a watch, not a phone. The killer uses for me are: “Now Playing” that lets me control volume and skips for music & podcast apps Texts – quick glance & quick replies to short texts Ping – make my phone ping when misplaced — I use this 10x/wk recording apps – (“Just Press Record”, “Mic’d”, “Say&Go” are all good) for notes either on the watch or the phone Nike+ and the workout app – these really honestly have make me run the extra mile harder, and have paid for the watch, I’m sure, in a longer and more fit life Other apps I use very often and which have added significant value are: Dark Sky for weather, GTasks for my tasks, Fantastical for what’s next, Heart Watch for heart stats, Breathe for slowing down and changing perspective, Capture for camera remote, Streaks for staying on track with behaviors, V for Wikipedia to buzz me about local pts. of interest, Shazam for quickly getting that song, lyrics, and bookmarking it Plus a timer, sunrise-sunset, Siri, a stopwatch, ATV remote, alarm and other complications. In reviews and discussions I see little about these functions, which I find are fast & easy to use. What I’ve done that I feel many others haven’t is spend time on the learning curve, including a couple of hours today, so I can use the watch as quickly as I do my phone. It has taken time to learn how things work and what apps and complications work best for me. Like “Now Playing” does with music and podcasts, the “Home” app gives me very very quick access to controlling my Hue lighting. I agree that this may become even more useful as my HomeKit rolls more smart devices (what’s taking you so long, Apple?). I totally love having this control on my wrist instead of pulling my humongous 6sPlus out of the pocket (or finding it where I lay it down). Tip: get the Nike+ model for the same price. Aftermarket bands are cheap on amazon. For me this thing is just short of a miraculous piece of technology as is, and the whining I hear is not understandable. David McAfee I have been holding off getting an Apple Watch purely because of battery life. AW3, provided it has a 3-4 day battery life, will probably be enough to sway me to get one. judith.moffatt I’ve generated $84 ,000 until now sometime this year working on line however I’m a full time student .

Cook still did extremely well, with a compensation package valued at $8.7 million for Apple's fiscal year that ended Sept. 24, according to a regulatory filing made Friday. But the amount was down from nearly $10.3 million in the prior year. The Cupertino, California, company cited a downturn in Apple's revenue and operating profit as the main reason it cut the pay of Cook and its other top executives. Apple's revenue dropped 8 percent to $216 billion, while its operating profit declined 16 percent to $60 billion. That was mainly because it sold fewer iPhones for the first time since the device came out in 2007. It also marked the first time that Apple's annual revenue decreased since 2001, which was just before the company's late co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the iPod. That digital music player set the stage for the iPhone and iPad. The iPhone triggered a revolution in mobile computing and became Apple's biggest moneymaker, even as a wide range of device makers released competing products primarily running on Google's free Android software. Most of the world's smartphones are powered by Android, but the iPhone remains a popular high-priced status symbol. Even so, consumers are holding on to their existing iPhones for longer periods instead of upgrading to a newer model every year or two. That has raised investor concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone, a nagging worry that has been aggravated by the company's inability to introduce another breakthrough product since Jobs' death in 2011. Cook, Jobs' anointed successor, had hoped Apple would have another huge hit with a smartwatch unveiled in 2014, but that device has only had moderate success. Apple's regulatory filing revealed that the company was bracing for a sales drop last year, although not quite as steep as what occurred. The compensation committee for Apple's board of directors had established a revenue goal of $224 billion for last year, which would have been a 4 percent decline from the previous year. The company expected sales to rebound during the holiday shopping season on hopes that consumers would be snapping up its latest iPhones, the 7 and 7 Plus. Apple will release its quarterly results that include the holidays later this month. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Firm hints Apple set to be first customer for radical technique to charge phones from fifteen feet away The 10th anniversary iPhone could be the first to be completely wireless Energous specializes in long-distance wireless charging technology  Current wireless charging relies on contact between devices and a base unit  By Cecile Borkhataria For Dailymail.com Published: 12:21 EST, 6 January 2017 | Updated: 18:19 EST, 6 January 2017 e-mail 8 shares 6 View comments Rumors have emerged that the next iPhone will have wireless charging technology, making it the first completely wireless iPhone.  Steve Rizzone, CEO of California start-up firm Energous, fueled the rumors in an interview with The Verge where he said they've signed a 'key strategic partnership' with 'one of the largest consumer electronic companies in the world.'  The technology could work over distances up to 15 feet (4.5 metres) and is expected to be released toward the latter half of 2017, which would tie in with the expected release of three anticipated new models of iPhone. Scroll down for video Energous's WattUp technology could allow people to charge all of their devices wirelessly with software control that can enable you to prioritize which devices should be charged more quickly HOW WOULD IT WORK?  California start-up firm Energous is thought to be working on a mid-range wireless charging transmitter which could work over distances up to 15 feet (4.5 metres).  The 'WattUp' platform, which uses small antennas to transfer energy over fairly long distances.  It works at greater distances than existing wireless charging solutions that rely on traditional inductive charging coils. The charging process is controlled by software, meaning end users can decide the order in which devices receive power and create schedules for their charging. Mr Rizzone said he couldn't reveal the company his firm is working with, but he can 'virtually guarantee that you have products from this company on your person sitting on your desk, or at home.' In a research note from market analyst Louis Basenese, which was obtained by Apple Insider, a number of other connections between Apple and Energous were made.  Among them is the defection of Apple's Regulatory Certification Program Manager Billy Manning. Mr Manning spent seven years at the company before joining Energous as Director of Regulatory Operations in September 2016. It has also emerged that Energous is working with Apple suppliers Dialog Semiconductor and Pegatron.

Share this article Share Current wireless charging relies on contact between devices and a base unit (pictured). But leaked information suggests Apple is working with Energous, who specialise in long-distance wireless charging technology SHOULD YOU UPGRADE TO THE IPHONE 7?  Some technology sites are advising users to hold off on upgrading their iPhones until the next year's version, which will mark the 10-year anniversary of Apple's revolutionary handset. Analysts say the iPhone 8 may feature a curved display that reaches from one edge of the device to the other and a home button integrated into the screen. But patents previously filed by the Apple suggest the technology giant has also been exploring the option of more traditional inductive wireless charging. A patent applied for by the firm, details of which emerged in September 2016, refers to an 'inductive charging station' similar to the plastic wireless charger used by the Apple Watch. The move would also fit with suggestions that the iPhone 8 will feature glass casing, to support wireless charging. Serbian-American inventor Nikolai Tesla first envisaged long-distance wireless electrical transfer more than 100 years ago.  But it is yet to make its way to the mainstream.  Previous rumours suggested Taiwan firm Foxconn Technology Group, a division of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, were making wireless charging modules to go with Apple's next iPhone. A patent applied for by the firm (pictured), details of which emerged in September 2016, refers to an 'inductive charging station' similar to the plastic wireless charger used by the Apple Watch Apple's upcoming iPhone 8 (artist's impression pictured) could be set to ditch the current aluminium and glass design in favour of a plastic OLED screen that curves 'all over' Rumours also suggest the iPhone 8 could be made from Bulk Amorphous Alloy, which is a mix of titanium, nickel, copper and zirconium melted together. This is said to have the smooth texture of glass and the rigid sturdiness of rubber (artist's impression)  IPHONE 8 RUMOURS  Several rumours have been circulating about the iPhone 8, and suggest the next device may have: - Dual-lens 3D camera - Augmented reality to generate real-time views of surroundings - Curved glass casing - Plastic OLED screen - Wireless charging - A folding element - New 5 inch (12.7 centimetre) and 5.8 inch (14.7 centimetre) models - A new 'pure white' model A research note from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo obtained by MacRumors commented on industry expectations. Mr Kuo said: ‘We believe one of the reasons why new iPhones will switch from metal casing to glass casing is to support wireless charging. ‘In order to ensure a superior performance, we believe it is most appropriate for EMS suppliers to develop and make the wireless charger because then a comprehensive test can be conducted.’ ‘As Hon Hai needs to deploy most resources to develop and produce OLED iPhone, we expect Pegatron will be the exclusive supplier of the wireless charger.’ A wireless charger would also solve a problem caused by Apple ditching the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone. It would enable users to charge their phone while simultaneously using the Lightning port to plug in a pair of headphones. Some technology sites are advising users to hold off on upgrading their iPhones until the next year's version, which will mark the 10-year anniversary of Apple's revolutionary handset. Analysts say the iPhone 8 may feature a curved display that reaches from one edge of the device to the other and a home button integrated into the screen.

From the ease of the initial setup to the small carrying case that doubles as a charger to the sound quality of the speakers and directional mics, the AirPods do a lot of things right -- elegantly, even -- yet they are not entirely without flaws. The $159 wireless headphones were announced back in September, but didn't start shipping until last month and were quickly backordered. Only recently have customers actually started receiving them and they're still a rare find at Apple Stores. (Buying directly from Apple's online store means a six week wait before the order ships.) Apple Store employees have told me that they receive daily shipments, and sell out quickly. Your best bet if you want a pair sooner rather than later is to track availability at your local Apple Store via iStockNow.com. That's what I did just before Christmas. I was able to use the Apple Store iPhone app to purchase my pair on Dec. 21 from the Providence Place Apple Store in Rhode Island as soon as iStockNow's availability indicator lit up green. Within a minute, that store was out of stock. Open box, easy setup In the box is the pair of AirPods, the small white carrying case that doubles as a charger, a Lightning-to-USB cable similar (if not identical) to the one that ships with iPhones and basic documentation -- a small foldout pamphlet with simple instructions for pairing and using the AirPods. Adam Patrick Murray AirPods are compatible with iOS devices capable of running iOS 10, any Mac capable of running macOS Sierra, and any Apple Watch running watchOS 3. To work seamlessly between devices, all must share the same iCloud account. Using the same iCloud account is part of what allows Apple to boast they're "magical;" it makes setup a breeze. Once the AirPods are paired up with one of your Apple devices, they're paired up with all your devices sharing the same iCloud account. AirPod setup is as follows: unlock your iPhone, open the lid of the AirPod carrying case within a couple of inches of the iPhone, and tap Connect on the iPhone's screen. That's it. Your iPhone -- and now, every Apple device you own -- can use your AirPods. This is possible because they use Apple's custom W1 chipset. It piggy-backs on the existing Bluetooth protocol and means AirPods are compatible with anything that can stream through Bluetooth, including Android phones. The W1 chipset doesn't just help with pairing, though; it is designed to help maintain a stable connection to each individual AirPod while maintaining about five hours of continuous battery life. (Editor's note: The W1 chip is also used in several new Beats headphones and allows the same easy setup and lengthy battery time.) The AirPods represent Apple's follow-up to the elimination of the analog audio jack in the iPhone 7. In addition to providing a dongle if you need to connect an older pair of headphones, Apple rolled out new technology that improves on current wireless implementations. Notice that I said improved, not perfected. But we'll get to that in a bit. Fit, feel and sound The AirPods are in-ear, but they aren't the type that squeezes into your ear canal. This means wearing them doesn't block ambient noise. Initially, I used the AirPods one at a time while doing chores or fixing computers at work. But I've found that even with both AirPods in, hearing your surroundings isn't a challenge if the volume is kept low. The speakers have a good range of volume and a pretty good balance of highs, lows, and mids. Bass is, well, bass is bass on a tinny speaker; existing technology hasn't changed that. But to my non-audiophile ears, the sound is more than acceptable and into "very good" territory. (My previous go-to earphones were the SmartOmi Boots mini wireless earbuds, which are in-ear and thus provide better bass.) Michael deAgonia From left to right, a SmartOmi Boots mini wireless earbud, an AirPod and the standard Apple EarPods. Despite the ease with which the AirPods slip on, it takes a lot of effort to knock them out. In my use -- which has involved running, weight-lifting, a couple of bouts of Insanity classes, and, just to see if I could knock them out, sustained head-banging -- the only time they fell out of my ears was when they were physically knocked out. (Other people have reported less luck keeping them in place, though; your mileage may vary.) Using them There are a couple of ways to interact with the AirPods, but because they lack buttons, actions are limited. Inserting one or both AirPods will sound a chime, alerting you that they're connected and ready. While audio is playing, removing one will pause the audio -- perfect if someone walks up to chat. Placing the AirPod back in your ear automatically resumes whatever you were listening to beforehand. If you remove both AirPods and then put them back in your ear, you have to manually trigger the audio to re-start. Double-tapping either AirPods brings up Siri or Play/Pause your audio source, depending on your setting. (Settings can be changed in the Bluetooth category in iPhone Settings.) And...that's it. To do anything else, you use Siri, which responds to commands for adjusting volume, skipping tracks, starting playlists, and other Siri-related functions like getting the weather, placing phone calls and dictating messages. The built-in microphones pick up audio really well (using what Apple calls a voice accelerometer in concert with the beamforming mics). At work -- in a quiet cube farm environment -- I invoked Siri but didn't want to disturb coworkers with audible commands. To my surprise, the AirPods were able to pick up commands I whispered. Using your voice to control basic functions works well enough; but Siri still needs enhanced capabilities to make the experience better. For instance, using Siri means that there needs to be an active internet connection, even for on-device functions like skipping tracks or volume adjustment. And Siri often displays the answer to a question on the iPhone screen instead of reading it out loud. So in that sense, Siri is a letdown. Support for local functions without an internet connection would be a good improvement. So would adding configurable multiple-tap options per AirPod. (In addition to the two taps that initiate Siri, there could be options for three taps on the right AirPod to skip, and three taps on the left to go back a track, etc. Thankfully, that's an option that could be added later via software update if Apple so chooses. Let's hope they do.) Keeping them charged The quality and build seem solid. When they're slid into the charging case, the AirPods snap into place via hidden magnets. The case also closes with a satisfying snap, and is held shut by magnets. That means there's no latch to catch on something or break, or button to depress to open the lid. And because it uses a decent magnet, you can be confident the case won't just open and cause you to accidentally lose an AirPod. (It costs $69 each to replace them if you do.) Michael deAgonia The AirPods carrying case doubles as a charger Just putting the pods in the case for storage means they're getting charged. Fifteen minutes of charging buys three hours of audio; on full charge, the AirPods should last for five hours. The case, which is charged with the included Lightning cable, has about 24 hours of battery capacity. In my experience, I've had to charge the case about once a week, while using the AirPods during the work day and for gym sessions. If you want to check the battery status of the AirPods and the carrying case, you can do so in the Control Center on your iPhone under the AirPods option, or when you flip open the carrying case near the unlocked iPhone. (The AirPods need to be in the case though.) Final thoughts Michael deAgonia Some people think the AirPods look goofy in use. I don't. The AirPods aren't without issues. I have had several dropped connections, and each time it was embarrassing. In a couple of weeks of daily testing, there were a few times the connection completely dropped and my iPhone speaker broadcast to my coworkers that I was listening to sports radio (Go Patriots!). It's annoying having to scramble for the audio pause button, so I'm hoping Apple will improve the connection behavior in the future. I've also noticed audio cutouts at times, when the sound drops out for a second or so. Interestingly, I've seen more hiccups with macOS than iOS 10. And I should note that a few people have told me they look goofy, in case that matters. But I don't care. Ultimately, the AirPods do much more right than wrong. If you're already in the Apple ecosystem, these AirPods (or even the newest Beats headphones with the W1 chipset) will work very well across all of your devices; if you're not in the Apple ecosystem, these little earphones are still worth checking out. Apple hasn't completely ended wireless audio issues with AirPods, but it's done a damned good job in a few specific areas (like initial setup and audio quality) to make the AirPods worthy of consideration if you're in the market for wireless headphones.

Beating that loud mouth Ballmer and copycat Gates would have made his day thinking back to the humble beginnings of Apple's first iMac.      Patently Apple covered the Gartner report on January 4 under the byline "Gartner Sees 2017 as a Stagnating Year for the Tech Sector." There was no official word from Ranjit Atwal, research director at Gartner, about Apple devices with their respective OSs possibly overtaking Windows 10 devices. So we're left having to believe that Atwal's added commentary, exclusive to Computerworld, actually took place.   Computerworld notes in their report that "In 2017, Apple's combination of iOS and macOS -- the former on iPhones and iPads, the latter on Macs -- will take second place from Windows on the devices shipped during the year. The gap between the two will widen in 2018 and 2019, with Apple ahead of Microsoft both years.   According to Gartner, which provided Computerworld with its latest device shipment forecast broken out by operating system, in 2016 Windows powered about 260 million devices of the 2.3 billion shipped during the year. Windows accounted for approximately 11.2% of the total devices, which overwhelmingly ran Google's Android. You could read about how Atwal arrives at his forecast here.   As much as I want to see that happen for the sake of a historical upset, I'm not sure it's going to be as easy as Atwal sees it. In December Patently Apple posted a report titled "Microsoft to Announce Qualcomm Snapdragon based Tablets and PCs with Built-In Cellular Capabilities on Thursday." Maybe I'm off base here, but with Huawei and Lenovo coming on board to promote Windows 10 on 2-in-1's along with new models from Samsung and Xiaomi to name just a few, I think the Windows meter is going to take a generous swing to the upside in 2017.   On the flip side, new Macs and iPads are going to debut in first half of 2017 and Apple may have more than just the anniversary iPhone up their sleeve for the September event to push iOS to all new highs. So both camps may have surprises to make this epic battle a lot of fun to stay on top of this year. For the history books, make your prediction below in the comments section and when we find out who won the battle next year we'll see who got it right.     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

 NOMURA: iPhone 8 is going to blow iPhone 6 out of the water Hannah Roberts Jan. 6, 2017, 8:00 AM 46,380 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook.REUTERS/Robert Galbraith Analysts at Nomura Instinet estimate that a "supercycle" will develop in the last three months of 2017 that will make iPhone 8 a much, much bigger product than iPhone 6. iPhone 6, launched in 2014, was an era-defining product for Apple that propelled the company to record sales. But Apple's iOS subscriber base — the number of people using an Apple product — is expected to be 45-50% larger than it was in 2014, according to Nomura Instinet. This next supercycle "seems well underappreciated," analysts Jeffrey Kvaal and Gregory McNiff wrote. Their forecast is higher than the consensus of their peers: "Consensus calls for 80 million iPhones in F1Q18 (Dec '17) ... only modestly above the iPhone 6 supercycle (75 million). However, we estimate the iPhone 8 will launch into an iOS subscriber base 45-50% larger than the iPhone 6 did and model 86 million iPhones in F1Q18 (from 83 million)." The increase in subscribers has been driven by sales of the iPhone 6, the analysts say. "We believe the iPhone 6 drove the iOS base up ~35%, followed by 5-10% increases from the subsequent devices," they wrote. Anyone who is still using an iPhone 6 is a prime candidate for buying a new iPhone in late 2017. The possibility that the upcoming iPhone could tap into a large base of people who are waiting to upgrade has been floated by several analysts before as a rationale for being bullish on Apple. The iPhone 8 — codenamed "Ferrari," according to leaked manufacturing documents — is expected to include a new kind of OLED screen already used by Samsung, which would allow the phone to have a borderless, all-display front surface. This OLED model may trigger replacement demand among high-end users, especially if it comes in an all-new design with notably superior specs, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Other rumoured features the document mentions include a glass-sandwich design — glass on the front and back of the phone — an invisible home button, and wireless charging.

While the graphics aren’t stunning in technical quality, the stylish and retro 60’s inspired theme is a nice throwback to the classic secret agent era of James Bond, Dick Tracy, and The Avengers. More importantly, however, the puzzles are challenging and engaging without being frustrating. While I was somewhat stuck at a few points, I didn’t find myself so stuck that I became tempted to look for hints online, which speaks to the game’s playability — you’re encouraged to keep poking around even when the answers aren’t obvious. While Agent A has been out for a while, the version 3.0 update adds a new chapter in a new environment with more interesting puzzles to solve, and even that’s open-ended — I’m already eagerly waiting to see what Chapter 4 holds. Another interesting point to note is that while the game is available both on the Apple TV and iPhone/iPad, players who want more of a challenge will want to tackle the iOS version. Somewhat by necessity of using the Siri remote rather than a touchscreen, the tvOS version presents “hot points” showing you everything you can interact with. While I prefer this to a free-floating cursor, it does provide a few more clues that aren’t available on the iOS side by showing you targets on areas you might not otherwise think to tap. Magic Fireplace ($1) — Virtual fireplaces were among the first apps to debut for the fourth-generation Apple TV last year, and the App Store is now pretty much littered with a whole bunch of pretty basic apps that either provide very limited fireplace options, low-quality images, or poor integration into the tvOS experience. So I was quite pleased when I discovered Jetson Creative’s Magic Fireplace. It’s an inexpensive virtual fireplace app that not only provides a selection of 26 high-quality slo-mo 60fps fireplaces, but a whole collection of other more advanced features ranging from customizing background sounds, mixing with music, displaying an on-screen clock, and even multiple color filters. All the fireplace videos looked stunning on my 65” plasma TV. Not surprising, considering the developer notes they were professionally mastered at 4K and the app isn’t just an iOS port — it was built with Metal specifically for the Apple TV. Individual fireplaces can be marked as favorites and you can scroll through them with the Siri Remote, or even automatically shuffle through your favorites or all fireplace selections. Eight different background soundtracks are also available, so you can customize how you want your fireplace to sound, and you can mix it with any music that’s already playing on your Apple TV and adjust the relative volume of the soundtrack so that it blends well with your music tracks. Black and white, sepia, grayscale, and retro filters are also in the app for changing up the colors, and four clock display modes allow you to optionally display the time and date over the fireplace. Maybe it’s just the heat that my plasma TV throws off by itself, but Magic Fireplace makes my living room feel even warmer than usual, and it ran pretty regularly here over the whole holiday season (naturally with appropriate Christmas music from Apple Music as a backtrack). The only downside is that it can’t be used as a default Apple TV screensaver, but that’s Apple’s limitation, not the developer’s. Strike! Ten Pin Bowling (free / $9) — This tvOS bowling game by Touch Mechanics turns the Siri Remote into a Wii-style motion controller, and will therefore be familiar to anybody who has wasted hours of their time bowling on the Wii. It’s a pretty straightforward bowling game, with smooth graphics and realistic physics, and I found it pretty engaging and hard to put down. It’s also good for indoor winter exercise — I easily made my Apple Watch workout goals after about an hour of play. The Siri Remote is used to pick up and throw the ball using natural motions that any fan of Wii bowling will already be familiar with, and the accelerometer in the remote lets you add spin and curve the ball as you swing and release. The full classic 10 pin game is here, along with three mini games and online play through Game Center, at least in the iOS versions — sadly, this seems to be unavailable when playing on the Apple TV. Other features like ball customization also appeared to be missing on the tvOS side, and it’s worth noting that while you’ll be able to bowl in the free version, the full tvOS games require separate purchases of up to $9 for the entire gaming pack, making the free version more of a trial version. That said, in my opinion, it’s a quality game well worth the price tag for the full series, and a lot of fun on the Apple TV. The only real downside is that I found myself concerned about accidentally hurling the Siri Remote into the TV screen. This may be the best justification we’ve seen to spend $13 on Apple’s Siri Remote Loop or something like Griffin’s Survivor Play for Siri Remote to improve your grip. Warp Shift (free) — Rounding out the set of apps I’ve been enjoying lately is FISHLABS’ new Warp Shift, and intriguing and challenging puzzle game with stunning graphics and sound design and engaging gameplay. While the premise seems pretty simple — rearrange a series of cube-shaped rooms to help your character find her way to the exit portal for each level — it ramps up in difficulty as you work your way through, and if you’re someone like me who always wants to nail the three-star rating on each level, you’ll be left twisting your brain to figure out how to do this in the very fewest possible moves. There are no in-app purchases here beyond completely optional hint packs, and even then FISHLABS gives you a free hint in exchange for watching an advertising video, so even if you’re really stuck you don’t really have to spend any money here unless you want to. Everything is done via taps and swipes, and scores are counted on move limits, not time limits, so there’s no rush, and the game is actually quite relaxing and ponderous as opposed to feeling rushed or energetic — even the soundtrack promotes a certain relaxing feel to the game. I actually found the whole experience to be very great for kicking back and de-stressing. Warp Shift is easily the most mesmerizing and relaxing puzzle game I’ve played since Monument Valley, and best of all, it’s entirely free.

Apple (AAPL.O) climbed 1.1 percent after Canada’s Competition Bureau did not find sufficient evidence the iPhone maker had engaged in anti-competitive conduct, closing a two-year investigation into the company. Wall Street has been on a tear since Trump won the U.S. election in November, with the Dow up 9 percent as investors bet he will stimulate the economy with lower taxes and infrastructure spending. While Friday’s gains suggested the rally was not yet over, some investors have grown cautious. “The market’s advance is understandable because of the economic stimulus optimism associated with a new Trump presidency,” said CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall. “But parabolic market advances traditionally experience digestion of these gains, and I don’t think this time will be any different.” The record trading session followed a U.S. Labor Department report that showed the economy added fewer-than-expected jobs last month but wages increased, suggesting resilience in the labor market. Stocks did not react significantly to a report that five people were dead in a shooting at Florida’s Fort Lauderdale airport. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 64.51 points, or 0.32 percent, to end at 19,963.8 points. The index rose as high as 19,999.63 but lost ground. Goldman Sachs (GS.N) rose 1.48 percent, helping the Dow more than any other stock. The S&P 500 .SPX gained 7.98 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,276.98, its highest close ever. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 33.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,521.06, also a record. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, led by the technology sector’s .SPLRCT 0.96 percent gain. For the week, the Dow rose 1 percent while the S&P gained 1.7 percent and the Nasdaq jumped 2.6 percent. INVESTORS EYE EARNINGS The strength of fourth-quarter earnings reports from U.S. companies over the next few weeks will be closely watched by investors eyeing high stock valuations. Following its recent gains, the S&P 500 is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, pricey compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Analysts on average expect fourth-quarter earnings to rise 6.1 percent compared to a year before, when slumping oil prices crippled energy companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. During the session, Amgen (AMGN.O) rose 2.48 percent after a U.S. district judge blocked Sanofi (SASY.PA) and Regeneron (REGN.O) from selling their cholesterol drug, which Amgen said infringed its patents. Regeneron fell 5.84 percent and was the biggest percentage loser on the S&P 500. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.11-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.21-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 24 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 76 new highs and 15 new lows. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, a bit under the 6.7 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon The Dow came within one point of 20,000 for the first time on Friday and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 reached record highs, boosted by Apple, extending a two-month rally fueled by optimism about U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Apple climbed 1.1 per cent after Canada’s Competition Bureau did not find sufficient evidence the iPhone maker had engaged in anti-competitive conduct, closing a two-year investigation into the company. Wall Street has been on a tear since Trump won the U.S. election in November, with the Dow up 9 per cent as investors bet he will stimulate the economy with lower taxes and infrastructure spending. While Friday’s gains suggested the rally was not yet over, some investors have grown cautious. “The market’s advance is understandable because of the economic stimulus optimism associated with a new Trump presidency,” said CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall. “But parabolic market advances traditionally experience digestion of these gains, and I don’t think this time will be any different.” The record trading session followed a U.S. Labor Department report that showed the economy added fewer-than-expected jobs last month but wages increased, suggesting resilience in the labor market. Stocks did not react significantly to a report that five people were dead in a shooting at Florida’s Fort Lauderdale airport. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 64.51 points, or 0.32 per cent, to end at 19,963.8 points. The index rose as high as 19,999.63 but lost ground. Goldman Sachs rose 1.48 per cent, helping the Dow more than any other stock. The S&P 500 gained 7.98 points, or 0.35 per cent, to 2,276.98, its highest close ever. The Nasdaq Composite  added 33.12 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 5,521.06, also a record. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, led by the technology sector’s 0.96 per cent gain. For the week, the Dow rose 1 per cent while the S&P gained 1.7 per cent and the Nasdaq jumped 2.6 per cent. Canada’s main stock index fell on Friday as gold miners and other materials stocks led a broad retreat to end an otherwise robust week of gains to start 2017. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index unofficially closed down 90.53 points, or 0.58 per cent, at 15,496.05. The index gained 1.4 per cent over the holiday-shortened week. The strength of fourth-quarter earnings reports from U.S. companies over the next few weeks will be closely watched by investors eyeing high stock valuations. Following its recent gains, the S&P 500 is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, pricey compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Analysts on average expect fourth-quarter earnings to rise 6.1 per cent compared to a year before, when slumping oil prices crippled energy companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.6 per cent after falling 1 per cent Thursday. It is little changed for the week. The offshore yuan fell 0.6 per cent to 6.8304 per dollar after a four-day climb. The euro dropped 0.7 percent to US$1.0534 and the pound retreated 1.1 percent to US$1.2288. Canada’s dollar was little changed at $1.3263 against its U.S. counterpart after the country posted its first trade surplus in more than two years and full-time jobs surged. Turkey’s lira was down 1.4 percent after touching a record low Thursday. Crude was little changed at US$53.74 a barrel in New York. U.S. government data showed strong job and wage gains while Kuwait and Saudi Arabia signaled they are curbing output. Gold futures fell 0.8 per cent to US$1,172.50 an ounce. Copper slipped 0.6 per cent and natural gas futures slid 0.7 per cent. © Thomson Reuters 2017 with files from Bloomberg News Find Financial Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Typo?

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley resident shares granddaughter's once-in-a-lifetime concert experience Friday Jan 6, 2017 at 12:57 PM Jan 6, 2017 at 5:01 PM Monica Solano Staff Writer @DP_MonicaInes APPLE VALLEY — Holding up a large yellow poster that read, “This is my 13th Birthday Present,” a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity was how young Briana Dinsdale described her seven minutes of fame when she was called up on stage by Keith Urban during a recent concert in Brisbane, Australia. “I knew they were going to the concert since they purchased the tickets well in advance, but I didn't think that would happen,” said Dinsdale's grandfather and Apple Valley resident William Wetzell. “I was both shocked and happy to know she had the best birthday ever.” Wetzell couldn’t contain his joy after being told his granddaughter was given the opportunity to stand alongside the country superstar on Dec. 17 and reached out to the Daily Press. The concert tickets were a birthday present for Dinsdale, but she never anticipated she'd get called on stage by Urban and given the opportunity to perform in front of thousands of people. “Knowing that Keith is such an amazing human being and to show that he cares for his fans was the biggest takeaway from that concert,” said Dinsdale, 13, who lives in Logan, Queensland, Australia. “Not many celebrities let their fans come on stage with them and take the time to get to know them.” Despite the long distance, Wetzell and Dinsdale remain very close thanks to an unbreakable bond over their love of music and Skype once a week, which is how Wetzell found out about the surprise at the concert. “She and the rest of her family are the love of our lives,” Wetzell said. “My wife and I could brag on and on about them. Music plays a huge part in their family and Briana has always been musically driven since she was a young girl.” A longtime fan of Urban, Dinsdale was starstruck when the famous country singer took notice of the sign and invited her to join him on stage. While on stage, Dinsdale told Urban she knew how to play piano and guitar, and she performed a few lines of “Temporary Home” by Carrie Underwood, wowing both Urban and the audience in the process. Urban then offered to take a selfie with the young girl before leaving the stage, all while her family captured the entire experience on video. Soon after, the video was posted on Dinsdale’s personal YouTube channel, where she also uploads her own original content and covers. The video, titled “The day I met Keith Urban,” has received over 104,000 views. “I’ve always been a fan of country music. I grew up with it thanks to my parents and playing piano when I was 4 was my parents' idea that music was an excellent way to assist my learning,” Dinsdale said. “Being a country singer, it allows you to be yourself and express your feelings in song. It brings the spark out in me.” During her free time, Dinsdale regularly performs and competes in country music competitions, and said in 2016 she was lucky enough to place first in a couple of categories. Along with participating in dance and running on her school’s cross country team, Wetzell said the young girl has also performed at the Raymond Theater. “She sang and recorded a song called ‘Grandpa’ as a Christmas present for me two years ago,” Wetzell said. “It was the best gift I’d ever received; I had to hold back tears. I'm very proud of her."  Dinsdale said she hopes to continue pursuing her dreams of becoming a famous songwriter, whether it be performing gigs at restaurants or playing in front of 15,000 people like Urban. “I would take in mind what Keith did for me and take the time to get to know my fans and let them get to know me,” Dinsdale said. "Just like Keith." Monica Solano can be reached at MSolano@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6231. Follow her on Twitter @DP_MonicaInes.

According to the report, the tech giant may continue using a-Si TFT-LCD for its computers until the end of the first quarter before making the shift to IGZO. Samsung and Sharp will allegedly start supplying IGZO panels to Apple by mid-2017, the report says. IGZO is a semiconducting material made up of Indium, Gallium, Zinc and Oxygen. It makes transistors smaller and provides a crystal clear display, Sharp explains on its site. IGZO has twice the resolution of ordinary LCDs, uses less power and delivers “life-like picture in super high definition.” Its electron mobility is 20-50 times faster than the MacBook Pro’s current display material.  Related Stories No More Battery Life Indicator with macOS Sierra 10.12. 2 Update CES 2017: You Will Soon Use Apple Pay At Vending Machines Apple’s switch to IGZO displays also suggests the company may soon introduce a new line of next-generation MacBook Pro. Apple will order approximately 13.6 million MacBook Pro display panels this year, fewer than the 16.2 million units ordered in 2016, IHS says. LG Display will likely remain as Apple’s largest supplier. Panels for MacBook Air will decrease from 6 million units in 2016 to 2.7 million this year, since production of those devices will end in 2017, the report says. Meanwhile, procurement for the MacBook Pro will rise from 8.8 million units last year to 9.7 million this year.

This will be the company’s first official store in the country, which also plays home to the headquarters of Samsung, Apple’s largest competitor in the smartphone space. A spokesperson for Apple confirmed the plans with Reuters via email, saying “We’re excited about opening our first Apple Store in Korea, one of the world’s economic centers and a leader in telecommunication and technology, with a vibrant K-culture.” The person wouldn’t say, however, where in Seoul the retail store will be located, or when it will open. There are 15 retail job listings for the store on Apple’s website, including a store leader and business manager, but they don’t reveal any added details. Regardless, when it happens, this will be an interesting move for Apple as it’s essentially moving onto Samsung’s home turf. The two companies are not only competitors, but they are also litigation rivals locked in several lawsuits, and supply chain partners.

And chances are that longtime Mac owners will have a mini DisplayPort-capable monitor lying around, as Apple has supported the standard since 2008. But if you want to connect your new MacBook to your mini DisplayPort monitor (including pre-2011 iMacs in Target Display Mode), you need to be aware of some compatibility limitations when it comes to Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C adapters. As discussed on Mac Geek Gab Episode 638, Apple’s Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter, while seemingly the simplest option, isn’t going to do the job. That’s because even though Macs with Thunderbolt 2 ports could output mini DisplayPort video, Apple didn’t include that functionality in the Thunderbolt 3 adapter. As stated in Apple Support Article HT207266: The Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter doesn’t support connections to these devices: Apple LED Cinema Display DisplayPort or mini DisplayPort displays DisplayPort or mini DisplayPort adapters, such as Mini DisplayPort to HDMI or Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapters Thunderbolt 3/USB-C to mini DisplayPort So if Apple’s adapter isn’t the answer, what is? One solution would be to pick up a Thunderbolt 3 docking station that has either a mini DisplayPort or full-sized DisplayPort output, such as the OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock. But Thunderbolt 3 docking stations are relatively expensive, and if all you’re looking for is a way to connect your 2016 MacBook Pro to your mini DisplayPort monitor, there’s a cheaper solution. As discussed on the NosillaCast podcast, you’ll need to turn to a third party adapter for mini DisplayPort compatibility. One such option recommended by a listener to the NosillaCast is the All Smart Life USB-C to mini DisplayPort Adapter, currently priced at $21.99. You’ll also find a range of similar adapters over at Amazon. Just plug it into your 2016 MacBook Pro, connect your monitor to the adapter’s mini DisplayPort connection, and you should be good to go. Apple’s Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter is still useful, of course, but only for connecting legacy Thunderbolt devices or Thunderbolt-capable displays such as the 27-inch Thunderbolt Display.

From Disney animators sketching classic characters, to an illustrator using an iPad Pro to design the New Yorker’s latest cover. In today’s latest artistic drive, Apple has partnered with five young Chinese artists to reinvent classic Nianhua folk art. On Apple’s new Made in CNY page, artists share the tools of their trade along with their art. Apple has written a small piece on each artist who showcase five different stylings used to tell the story of the Nianhua, Chinese for ‘Year Picture.’ More interestingly, Apple is also showing individual times to meet these very artists at different Apple Stores located around China. Interested customers can head over to the site to register for the events when they become live. The artists have used a mix of Apple products to create the final works seen on the website, including MacBook Pros, iMacs, and iPad Pros and the Apple Pencil. In Jianh Shan’s Fortune Flows (pictured above), the artist drafted the artwork down on paper, before eventually moving to Adobe Illustrator to round out the final touches. With Lucky Rooster, Victo Ngai used the Apple Pencil, iPad Pro, and the Procreate app to sketch out her work, and moved to the MacBook Pro to finalize the composition.

Head over to the Made in CNY page to read more on how each artist designed their work and to download free copies of each as a Mac, iPhone, or iPad wallpaper.

Reuters/Mike Segar The iPhone 7 Plus is the best phone Apple has ever produced to date, but how does it fare battery-wise against its predecessors? Let’s see if the Cupertino-based tech giant’s latest handset can topple the older iPhone 6s Plus and the even older iPhone 6 Plus in a battery endurance test. The new iPhone 7 Plus equips a non-removable lithium-ion battery with 2,900 mAh capacity. It offers up to 21 hours of phone calls and 60 hours of music play. Apple’s latest smartphone can last a couple days of moderate usage. One advantage that the iPhone 7 Plus has over the previous models is that it packs the latest energy-efficient A10 Fusion chipset, which allows for a longer battery life. No fast charging feature is available on the iPhone 7 Plus, so charging can take more than two hours before the battery is full. The iPhone 6s Plus lithium-ion battery is also non-removable although it has a much lower capacity compared to that of the iPhone 7 Plus at 2,750 mAh. The 6s Plus delivers up to 24 hours of talk time and 80 hours of music play. Just like its successor, it can last up to two days with normal use. The iPhone 6s Plus also has a battery-saving feature that provides an extra number of hours. Users can turn it on by going to Settings so they can be notified when the battery level drops to 20 percent. The iPhone 6s Plus also takes about two hours to fully charge. The iPhone 6 Plus furnishes a non-removable 2,915 mAh lithium polymer battery, which is slightly more powerful than that of the iPhone 7 Plus in terms of strength, although it provides the same number of hours as the iPhone 6s Plus when it comes to phone calls and music play. According to Trusted Reviews, the iPhone 6 Plus can last two full days of reasonable use provided that the display brightness is set to 50 percent. When TechRadar pitted the three Apple iPhone Plus handsets against each other in a rigid battery performance test, the iPhone 6 Plus was completely drained after just 3 hours and 34 minutes of work. The iPhone 6s Plus lasted 3 hours and 54 minutes while the iPhone 7 Plus withstood the heavy labour the longest, lasting 4 hours and 15 minutes.

A newly discovered video, posted to YouTube by independent tech journalist Sonny Dickson, shows an iPhone running an iPod-like precursor to the iOS operating system, dubbed Acorn. In the prototype, the iPhone was controlled by a virtual “click wheel” in the bottom half of the screen, not the familiar touch-button apps we know today. The prototype had a menu display in the top half, just like early version of the iPod, and a black strip in the middle with buttons for rewind, menu, play/pause and fast forward. The Acorn software was entirely text-based, with options for “favorites,” “recents,” “dial” and “SMS,” in addition to all the menu items familiar to iPod users at the time. Though the video doesn’t show a call being placed, it gives us a peek at a dialer that probably would have driven iPhone owners insane. It appears as though people would have had to dial numbers like on an old rotary phone. God help them if they wanted to type a text message. “You can see why we ditched it?” iPod designer and former Apple executive Tony Fadell tweeted Friday morning. The click-wheel iPhone has long been legend. Steve Jobs biographer Walter Isaacson wrote that Apple’s engineers weren’t sure customers would be able to master a smartphone with a touchscreen, so they pursued an alternate operating system controlled by a click wheel. Until Friday, a patent filed in 2006 was our only glimpse at what a click-wheel iPhone could have looked like. It turns out the patent drawings were very similar to the prototype revealed on Friday. Early prototypes for the iPhone are rarely seen: Apple famously destroys its rejected designs to avoid leaks. But we’ve been treated to a few glimpses into Apple engineers’ thinking about how the first iPhone should have been designed. A patent dispute with Samsung in 2012 made public several early versions of the iPhone’s hardware, including some truly odd shapes and sizes. According to Isaacson’s biography, Apple’s engineers got fully behind the touchscreen concept because they could not figure out how to dial and text using a click wheel. The touchscreen iPhone we’re all familiar with ultimately debuted in 2007.

Though the video doesn't show a call being placed, it gives us a peek at a dialer that probably would have driven iPhone owners insane. It appears as though people would have had to dial numbers like on an old rotary phone. God help them if they wanted to type a text message. "You can see why we ditched it?" iPod designer and former Apple executive Tony Fadell tweeted Friday morning. SW version of iPod+Phone for UI team. You can see why we ditched it? Apple's click wheel iPhone https://t.co/622WOH9WfI @Verge @jjvincent— Tony Fadell (@tfadell) January 6, 2017 The click-wheel iPhone has long been legend. Steve Jobs biographer Walter Isaacson wrote that Apple's engineers weren't sure customers would be able to master a smartphone with a touchscreen, so they pursued an alternate operating system controlled by a click wheel. Until Friday, a patent filed in 2006 was our only glimpse at what a click-wheel iPhone could have looked like. It turns out the patent drawings were very similar to the prototype revealed on Friday. Early prototypes for the iPhone are rarely seen: Apple famously destroys its rejected designs to avoid leaks. But we've been treated to a few glimpses into Apple engineers' thinking about how the first iPhone should have been designed. A patent dispute with Samsung in 2012 made public several early versions of the iPhone's hardware, including some truly odd shapes and sizes. According to Isaacson's biography, Apple's engineers got fully behind the touchscreen concept because they could not figure out how to dial and text using a click wheel. The touchscreen iPhone we're all familiar with ultimately debuted in 2007.

Noel Randewich Reuters Published Friday, Jan. 06, 2017 4:25PM EST Last updated Friday, Jan. 06, 2017 4:25PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print The Dow came within one point of the 20,000-point milestone for the first time ever on Friday, boosted by a rise in Apple shares and extending a two-month rally fuelled by optimism that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s policies will bolster the economy. Canada’s main stock index fell on Friday as gold miners and other materials stocks led a broad retreat to end an otherwise robust week of gains to start 2017. All three major U.S. indexes were set to notch record high closes, helped by Apple. The iPhone maker climbed 1.16 per cent after Canada’s Competition Bureau did not find sufficient evidence it had engaged in anti-competitive conduct, closing a two-year investigation into the company. U.S. stocks have risen sharply since Trump won the U.S. election in November, with the Dow up 9 per cent. While Friday’s gains suggested the rally was not yet over, some investors have grown cautious. “The market’s advance is understandable because of the economic stimulus optimism associated with a new Trump presidency,” said CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall. “But parabolic market advances traditionally experience digestion of these gains, and I don’t think this time will be any different.” The first record high of the year for the S&P 500 followed a U.S. Labor Department report that showed the economy added fewer-than-expected jobs last month but wages increased, suggesting resilience in the labour market. Stocks did not react significantly to a report that five people were dead following a shooting at Florida’s Fort Lauderdale airport. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 64.99 points, or 0.33 per cent, to 19,964.28, the S&P 500 gained 8.01 points, or 0.35 per cent, to 2,277.01 and the Nasdaq Composite added 33.12 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 5,521.06. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index closed down 90.53 points, or 0.58 per cent, at 15,496.05. The index gained 1.4 per cent over the holiday-shortened week. The Canadian dollar fell 0.07 of a cent to 75.5 cents (U.S.) after a strong week of gains as commodity prices rose. Nine of the 10 TSX sectors were down, led lower by a 3.48-per-cent decrease in the materials sector, and a decline of 1 per cent by the consumer staples sector. Crew Energy was down 4 per cent, Air Canada fell 1.24 per cent, while MacDonald Dettwiler rose 2.8 per cent after announcing a $100-million contract with NASA. In the U.S., Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, led by the technology sector’s 1.07 per cent gain. The Nasdaq was on track to end the week up 2.7 per cent. The S&P 500 headed for a 1.8 per cent weekly rise while the Dow was on track to end 1.1 per cent higher for the week. The strength of fourth-quarter earnings reports from U.S. companies over the next few weeks will be closely watched by investors eyeing high stock valuations. Following its recent gains, the S&P 500 is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, pricey compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Analysts on average expect fourth-quarter earnings to rise 6.1 per cent compared to a year before, when slumping oil prices crippled energy companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. During the session, Amgen rose 2.7 per cent after a U.S. district judge blocked Sanofi and Regeneron from selling their cholesterol drug, which Amgen said infringed its patents. Regeneron fell 5.3 per cent and was the biggest percentage loser on the S&P 500. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.02-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.12-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 24 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 71 new highs and 14 new lows.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Canadian Competition Bureau Closes its Investigation into Apple Conducting Anti-Competitive Practices | Main | Oh, this News would have put a Big Smile on Steve Jobs Face » January 06, 2017 Huawei Begins their Big Squeeze on Samsung in the U.S. Today   In December Patently Apple posted a report titled "Samsung is going to Experience the 'Big Squeeze' in 2017 and their U.S. Market Share is Headed for a Crash." The report noted that Huawei, Oppo and Xiaomi were coming to the U.S. in 2017 and with more quality Android smartphone options, Samsung was likely to experience a decline in U.S. smartphone market share. On Monday Samsung's Co-CEO Kwon Oh-hyun addressed employees and warned that Samsung would experience "lagging" growth in its key markets and pledged reforms to avoid a repeat of the "expensive" Note 7 smartphone recall debacle.   This week at a pre-CES event, Huawei Device USA revealed that its highly-acclaimed Huawei Mate 9 will be available in the United States starting January 6, 2017. Building on Huawei's renowned innovation, the beautifully-designed Mate 9 delivers an all-new Android experience, featuring fast computing performance for 18 months with the new Kirin 960 chipset and machine-learning algorithm, SuperCharge technology for safe and fast charging, and a stunning new photo experience. For more of the details on this smartphone see Huawei's full press release here.   Oppo is likely aiming to enter the market later this fall. The only one of the original three that won't be coming to the U.S. as first forecasted is Xiaomi who basically chickened out. Xiaomi's global VP, Hugo Barra was quick to dispell any hope for their Mi line of Xiaomi phones entering the U.S. this year.   Bara squirmed around the rumors by saying that "We don't have any specific-enough plans yet that we're comfortable talking about yet." Of course the bravado was at a fever pitch about Xiaomi coming to the U.S. when Xiaomi was hitting the top five smartphone makers chart in China. This year they were wiped off that chart by Oppo and Vivo (owned by BBK) and new challengers are on the way like OnePlus.   So their glorious dreams of entering the U.S. on a flying chariot of fire is now all but a lost opportunity. They're just one brand amongst many mid-tier players with nothing much that could distinguish them.     Barra added that "We don't want to go anywhere near the half-hearted efforts to launch a brand in the US just to say we're in the US."   At the end of the day, Samsung was able to change the narrative about their disastrous Note7 today by pre-announcing that the conglomerate known as Samsung was going to announce a very strong quarter.   But let's not lose sight of the reality that their mobile division was a major loser this quarter and if it wasn't for an army of other products made under the Samsung brand, their stock would have gotten run over by Wall Street brokers running for the doors.   The reality of the day is that their Co-CEO said on Monday that they would experience "lagging" growth in its key markets – and that of course is a reference to the U.S., first and foremost, and it's due to new competition on the way that started this week with Huawei's announcement at a pre-CES event.   The big squeeze has begun and the anniversary iPhone is only going to give Samsung a bigger headache later this year. But as much as I'm not a fan of Samsung, they're a resilient mega beast and the Galaxy S8 is going to be jammed packed with goodies to delight their fans.   Samsung may even try to get under the skin of Apple fans by offering their new Galaxy S8 customers free wireless earbuds to mock Apple's very expensive AirPods. It's hard to believe that Samsung would go that far to sell their new smartphone, but that's what the rumor was this week. Desperate times push companies to take desperate measures and the big squeeze on Samsung has only begun.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Andrew Cunningham - Jan 6, 2017 6:14 pm UTC Enlarge / Apple's executive pay for 2016. Apple reader comments 150 Share this story Further ReadingApple is 19 percent less profitable in Q4 of 2016 than in Q4 of 2015 Apple raked in $215.6 billion in sales in 2016, but it wasn't enough to keep the company from reporting its first year-over-year sales decline since 2001. According to the company's definitive proxy statement filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the company's sales declined from $233.7 billion in 2015, and its operating income likewise fell from $71.2 billion in 2015 to $60.0 billion in 2016. The decline in these two metrics was enough to significantly cut incentive-based pay for Tim Cook and a number of other high-level Apple executives. The SEC report lists the earnings of six "named executives," including CEO Tim Cook, CFO Luca Maestri, Retail SVP Angela Ahrendts, Internet Software and Services SVP Eddy Cue, Hardware Engineering SVP Dan Riccio, and General Counsel Bruce Sewell. Cook's base salary is set at $3 million, while the other executives' base pay is $1 million. Each executive has the opportunity to earn up to four times his or her base salary if the company meets net sales and operating income goals. Incentive payout targets versus where Apple fell in 2016. Apple Last year, all of the executives maxed out their potential cash bonuses—Cook received an $8 million cash bonus based on his then-$2 million base salary, and the other named executives earned $4 million based on their $1 million base salaries. This year, Cook earned $5.3 million and other executives earned about $1.8 million, a little less than twice each executive's base salary. Each of the executives aside from Cook received $20 million in stock, $8 million of which is incentive-based (though the way these incentives are awarded depends on Apple's stock performance relative to other companies rather than its revenue). Apple's revenue fell this year mostly because the iPhone declined—the iPhone 6S was unable to repeat the iPhone 6's success. Sales in China fell precipitously after surging in 2015, and unexpectedly strong sales for the iPhone SE lowered the iPhone's average selling price. Revenue from services like the App Store and Apple Music grew at a steady clip throughout the year, but it wasn't nearly enough to make up for the iPhone's stumble or the smaller year-over-year dips in iPad and Mac sales. For 2017, Apple will be making its executives' pay even more dependent on performance—specifically, up to 50 percent of "long-term equity incentives" (i.e. stock) will rely on the company's performance in the coming fiscal year. The company's earnings call for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 will happen on January 31, and the company has projected revenue between $76 and $78 billion, slightly beating the $75.9 billion it earned in the first quarter of 2016.

LIKE   TWEET   SHARE   PIN   SHARE   POST MAIL MORE Posted January 6, 2017 at 8:08pm by iClarified · 7264 views · Translate Apple is planning to shift to IGZO display panels for the MacBook Pro in the second quarter of 2017, according to an IHS report via DigiTimes. It's estimated that Apple will purchase 13.6 million notebook panels in 2017, that's fewer than the 16.2 million it purchased in 2016. LG will likely remain Apple's largest supplier. IHS believes that Apple will stop production of the 11.6-inch MacBook Air this year and so the number of MacBook Air panels it purchases will reportedly decrease from 6 million to 2.7 million as there is considerable 13.3-inch inventory. Currently, Apple uses a-Si TFT-LCD panels for the MacBook Pro but that will purportedly change very soon. Apple may continue to procure a-Si TFT-LCD panels for the MacBook Pro until the end of the first quarter of 2017 and then shift to IGZO TFT-LCD panels. In addition to Samsung Display, Sharp will begin supplying IGZO TFT-LCD panels to Apple as soon as mid-2017. Procurement for the MacBook Pro will increase from 8.8 million units in 2016 to 9.7 million units in 2017. IGZO panels use less power, have improved touch sensitivity, and increased pixel density. DisplayMate President Raymond Soneira told MacRumors that IGZO can also result in "significantly higher brightness," but the material costs "considerably more" to manufacture. "Sometimes IGZO is simply referred to as Metal Oxide," says Soneria. "The higher the PPI and the wider the Color Gamut (like DCI-P3 for the new MacBook Pro) the greater the benefits of IGZO over a-Si, particularly for LCDs." Notably, IGZO displays can be made smaller, perhaps allowing for a thinner MacBook Pro; however, Apple would have to balance this with battery life concerns, especially following battery issues with the new MacBook Pro. IGZO displays have been rumored for the MacBook Pro in the past; however, those rumors never materialized. Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

With that in mind, how will third party accessory manufacturers figure out whether there is a large enough market for Apple Watch add-ons? The CMRA is a bold attempt for sure, being an industry-first smart watchband for the Apple Watch. First revealed to the world last November by Glide, the CMRA will boast of not just one, but a pair of High Definition (HD) cameras which will work in tandem to deliver a seamless photo and video capturing experience from your wrist itself. Yes, you might be seen as fiddling with menu options on your Apple Watch by those who do not know any better when you are actually performing a James Bond routine, trying to capture what’s going on around you. The dual-camera band would see the Apple Watch gain a self-facing camera which will pave open the way to snap selfies with your smartwatch, or to carry out a video chat on it. Certainly an accessory that is truly original at this point in time. Pre-orders for the CMRA are available for $169 a pop, where it ought to ship from this spring onward if there are no hiccups. If you missed out on the pre-order, then the final retail price would be a far more expensive $249. Filed in Gadgets. Read more about CES, CES 2017.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley resident shares granddaughter's once-in-a-lifetime concert experience Friday Jan 6, 2017 at 12:57 PM Jan 6, 2017 at 5:01 PM Monica Solano Staff Writer @DP_MonicaInes APPLE VALLEY — Holding up a large yellow poster that read, “This is my 13th Birthday Present,” a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity was how young Briana Dinsdale described her seven minutes of fame when she was called up on stage by Keith Urban during a recent concert in Brisbane, Australia. “I knew they were going to the concert since they purchased the tickets well in advance, but I didn't think that would happen,” said Dinsdale's grandfather and Apple Valley resident William Wetzell. “I was both shocked and happy to know she had the best birthday ever.” Wetzell couldn’t contain his joy after being told his granddaughter was given the opportunity to stand alongside the country superstar on Dec. 17 and reached out to the Daily Press. The concert tickets were a birthday present for Dinsdale, but she never anticipated she'd get called on stage by Urban and given the opportunity to perform in front of thousands of people. “Knowing that Keith is such an amazing human being and to show that he cares for his fans was the biggest takeaway from that concert,” said Dinsdale, 13, who lives in Logan, Queensland, Australia. “Not many celebrities let their fans come on stage with them and take the time to get to know them.” Despite the long distance, Wetzell and Dinsdale remain very close thanks to an unbreakable bond over their love of music and Skype once a week, which is how Wetzell found out about the surprise at the concert. “She and the rest of her family are the love of our lives,” Wetzell said. “My wife and I could brag on and on about them. Music plays a huge part in their family and Briana has always been musically driven since she was a young girl.” A longtime fan of Urban, Dinsdale was starstruck when the famous country singer took notice of the sign and invited her to join him on stage. While on stage, Dinsdale told Urban she knew how to play piano and guitar, and she performed a few lines of “Temporary Home” by Carrie Underwood, wowing both Urban and the audience in the process. Urban then offered to take a selfie with the young girl before leaving the stage, all while her family captured the entire experience on video. Soon after, the video was posted on Dinsdale’s personal YouTube channel, where she also uploads her own original content and covers. The video, titled “The day I met Keith Urban,” has received over 104,000 views. “I’ve always been a fan of country music. I grew up with it thanks to my parents and playing piano when I was 4 was my parents' idea that music was an excellent way to assist my learning,” Dinsdale said. “Being a country singer, it allows you to be yourself and express your feelings in song. It brings the spark out in me.” During her free time, Dinsdale regularly performs and competes in country music competitions, and said in 2016 she was lucky enough to place first in a couple of categories. Along with participating in dance and running on her school’s cross country team, Wetzell said the young girl has also performed at the Raymond Theater. “She sang and recorded a song called ‘Grandpa’ as a Christmas present for me two years ago,” Wetzell said. “It was the best gift I’d ever received; I had to hold back tears. I'm very proud of her."  Dinsdale said she hopes to continue pursuing her dreams of becoming a famous songwriter, whether it be performing gigs at restaurants or playing in front of 15,000 people like Urban. “I would take in mind what Keith did for me and take the time to get to know my fans and let them get to know me,” Dinsdale said. "Just like Keith." Monica Solano can be reached at MSolano@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6231. Follow her on Twitter @DP_MonicaInes.

The iPhone maker listed hiring notices for 15 positions dated Thursday on its website, including a store leader and a business manager. The listings did not specify the exact location or when those who are hired will begin working. "We're excited about opening our first Apple Store in Korea, one of the world's economic centres and a leader in telecommunication and technology, with a vibrant K-culture," Apple told Reuters in a statement yesterday. "We're now hiring the team that will offer our customers in Seoul the service, education and entertainment that is loved by Apple customers around the world." The company declined to comment on where in Seoul its store would be or when it would open. But South Korea's Yonhap News Agency said yesterday that construction was under way for the outlet at a location in a southern district of Seoul and that the work will likely be completed by end-November.

But now that AirPods are here and I’ve been using them daily for an extended period of time, the difference is even more striking than I anticipated. With AirPods, Apple has done what it does best: taken an emerging product category with a frustrating user experience and delivered a polished product made possible by its control over both the hardware and software. And the AirPods are one of the best examples of that in a long time. But is there any competition or even a decent alternative? Fit and Comfort The fit of AirPods was always bound to be a topic of controversy. Since they don’t have silicone or flexible tips like most competitors, which allows a certain level of customization and a particularly snug fit, they won’t work for everyone. And if they don’t fit, the rest doesn’t really matter. A lot has been made about the stem on AirPods that hangs down out of the user’s ear. Aside from housing the microphone closer to the mouth and giving some extra space for components in general, this gives AirPods another really big advantage that not many have mentioned. The charging contacts aren’t inside of the ear, which is a major downfall for the majority of competitors… I originally had hopes of using a pair from the competition as my new daily driver earbuds, replacing my wireless Jaybird earbuds that I’ve enjoyed for several months now, at least until I had a set of AirPods to compare side by side. That didn’t happen. Sol Republic’s Amps Air ($179) have great sound and for bass lovers beat out the AirPods. But they were way too bulky for me personally and ideally need to shave off about 20% in overall size before they can compete. And when weight and bulkiness wasn’t an issue– like with Skybuds and Bragi’s The Headphone— exposed charging contacts irritated my skin and caused discomfort over extended periods of use.  I had a lot of recommendations to try out Erato’s Apollo 7 buds ($249) following my previous reviews. They offered a comfortable fit and are the only non-AirPods option without charging contacts touching the skin, but the bullet-shape (opposed to the hearing-aid style of others) made them protrude in a way that both looked silly and felt a bit heavy in my ears. It’s not just the Erato and Bragi products, I had one or more of these issues with all 7 sets of cord-free earbuds I tested (full list below). The consensus on AirPods seems to be in: they fit better for more people than Apple’s old EarPods, and I found that to be true for my ears too… Zac mentioned on a recent episode of 9to5Mac’s Happy Hour podcast that it seems to be the lack of a cord pulling downward that gives the AirPods a nicer fit for more people compared to Apple’s old wired EarPods that otherwise have just about the same physical shape. Thats not unique to AirPods, but it’s part of the reason it seems AirPods are overall getting a thumbs up for fit. For that reason I’d recommend trying them even if EarPods weren’t particularly comfortable for you. There is of course going to be exceptions to that. Everyone has different ears. For me they pass the shake test no problem and I’ve been using them for daily workouts. There are also companies making accessories that might allow more people to find a comfortable and tight fit with AirPods, and I think there will be market for those.  Connectivity and Pairing When I did find a decent fit, everything but AirPods was a nightmare for connectivity and pairing.  It became quite clear in my tests in recent months that companies were having a tough time with cord-free earbuds and getting the individual earbuds to both pair and deliver stereo sound reliably. This is where the AirPods shine and live up to Apple’s ‘it just works’ promise where the competition has all failed miserably to come up with a solution.  The experience is the same with everything but AirPods. Turn on your earbuds (some will automatically turn on when taken out of their case) and then navigate to Settings, Bluetooth and select the product from a list to initiate a connection. Some are supposed to automatically pair after you’ve done this process the first time, but none of them seemed to be able to do that reliably, and that was frustrating to say the least. Erato’s Apollo 7’s would sometimes not deliver audio at all even though they’d appear as connected. Bragi’s The Headphone would sometimes deliver sub-par sound quality and require a reboot to fix. And Samsung’s and the rest almost never automatically paired reliably, requiring me to often cycle power on and off, fumble through Bluetooth settings, and swear a little while preparing to leave for my morning workout. AirPods have none of these issues. Open the case, stick them in your ears, and start playing your music. Open the case at any time and instantly get a breakdown of remaining battery for the AirPods and charging case (as pictured above). Apple needed to build something it’s calling the W1 chip to offer this seamless experience, and it makes a world of difference. You can finally use cord-free earbuds as easily as your old wired headphones, as long as you remember to charge them. Sound Quality The Skybuds and Bragi’s The Headphone both seemed promising but I eventually stopped reaching for them due to a mix of not-so-great sound quality, the exposed charging contacts mentioned above, and frustration with the pairing process among my devices. An important thing to note: the sound quality issues with the earbuds I tested weren’t always due to low-quality components necessarily but seemed to be tied a lot to Bluetooth connectivity problems and fit. The Bragi Headphone is capable of sounding half decent, but I found the experience to be rather inconsistent. I’d often have to readjust the earbuds several times to get a fit that allowed them to sound decent, and sometimes I’d get low quality sound at first until turning off and then repairing. I experienced those issues with the Skybuds too. I was mostly reviewing these products for the headphone experience, so mic quality was never a make or break feature for me. I would describe call quality as poor to passable for most of the earbuds I tested, but AirPods offered noticeably clearer call quality compared to the top of the line competition. It’s still not something I’d rely on for important calls in noisy environments, but it’s another win for the AirPods. The sound on the AirPods is nothing to brag about, but it’s solid and consistent enough that they at least get a passable grade for a recommendation. Sol Republic’s Amps Air are the only option that had noticeably bigger bass and fuller sound than AirPods, and they needed a much bulkier design to achieve it. If you are waiting for audiophile quality sound in cord-free earbuds, they simply don’t exist yet. Charging Cases Wow. Just look at the AirPods charging case next to the competition. I never truly realized just how small this thing is— it’s not much bigger than the AirPods themselves— and that doesn’t mean it’s lacking any features that the other guys have. The case charges your AirPods a handful of times, giving you around 24 hours of listening time before needing to plug-in. That’s as good and in many cases much better than all of the competition. The charging case turned out to be one of the most impressive aspects of the AirPods after getting my hands on them and comparing to what the competitors came up with. The size is a big deal considering the point of the case is to carry it around with you. Apple’s is easily pocketable. The competition? Not so much.  My time with AirPods doesn’t come without a few complaints, but those mostly fall into the nitpicking category for now as they haven’t prevented me from using the product daily. And my complaints and feature requests— things like lack of volume control without Siri and no offline Siri support for basic functions— seem like no-brainers for Apple to add in future iOS updates.  Winner: AirPods But if AirPods don’t fit, what do you go for? If they must be cord-free, Samsung’s Gear IconX buds for me and handful of people I tested with offered the best fit in the most compact form factor that looked decent in the ear. A soft matte rubber material over the entire earbud makes them particularly comfortable in the inner ear, and small hooks are positioned to lock them-in for extra security. But I still found the charging contacts to irritate my inner-ear with use over extended periods of time, which is something you’ll have to test for yourself. They sounded a bit dull compared to Apple’s AirPods that are in contrast a bit tinny but much better sounding. Unfortunately you will miss out on many of the other upsides of AirPods if you don’t have headphones with the W1-chip. But in my tests Samsung’s Gear IconX offered the best alternative for both fit, style, and sound quality if AirPods are an absolute no-go due to fit. You could also try using AirPods with a rubber ear hook attachment for a better fit, and there are strap attachments for those really worried about losing one. Or look to wireless Bluetooth W1 options with cables like the Beats PowerBeats3 and upcoming BeatsX if cord-free isn’t a must have for you right away.  Runner-up: Samsung Gear IconX But what about CES taking place in Las Vegas this week? Surely there are a number of promising competitors being shown off? Nuheara is showing off its IQ buds ($299) that are still on preorder for Q1, Earin has $249 buds with not-so-great 3 hours of battery that also aren’t shipping, and both don’t do much to shake the hearing-aid look of the current competition. So no, not really.

Home Market Boosted by Apple, Wall Street parties like it’s 19,999 Boosted by Apple, Wall Street parties like it’s 19,999 The Dow came within one point of 20,000 for the first time ever on Friday, boosted by a rise in Apple shares and extending a two-month rally fueled by optimism that Trump's policies will bolster the economy. By: Reuters | Published: January 7, 2017 2:24 AM Stocks did not react significantly to a report that five people were dead in a shooting at Florida’s Fort Lauderdale airport. (Reuters) The Dow came within one point of 20,000 for the first time ever on Friday, boosted by a rise in Apple shares and extending a two-month rally fueled by optimism that US President-elect Donald Trump’s policies will bolster the economy. All three major US indexes were set to notch record high closes, helped by Apple. The iPhone maker climbed 1.16 percent after Canada’s Competition Bureau did not find sufficient evidence it had engaged in anti-competitive conduct, closing a two-year investigation into the company. US stocks have risen sharply since Trump won the U.S. election in November, with the Dow up 9 percent. While Friday’s gains suggested the rally was not yet over, some investors have grown cautious. “The market’s advance is understandable because of the economic stimulus optimism associated with a new Trump presidency,” said CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall. “But parabolic market advances traditionally experience digestion of these gains, and I don’t think this time will be any different.” The first record high of the year for the S&P 500 followed a U.S. Labor Department report that showed the economy added fewer-than-expected jobs last month but wages increased, suggesting resilience in the labor market. Also Watch: Stocks did not react significantly to a report that five people were dead in a shooting at Florida’s Fort Lauderdale airport. At 2:57 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 84.99 points, or 0.43 percent, to 19,984.28 points. The index rose as high as 19,999.63. The S&P 500 gained 10.56 points, or 0.46 percent, to 2,279.56 and the Nasdaq Composite added 39.75 points, or 0.72 percent, to 5,527.69. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, led by the technology sector’s 1.07 percent gain. The Nasdaq was on track to end the week up 2.7 percent. The S&P 500 headed for a 1.8 percent weekly rise while the Dow was on track to end 1.1 percent higher for the week. The strength of fourth-quarter earnings reports from U.S. companies over the next few weeks will be closely watched by investors eyeing high stock valuations. Following its recent gains, the S&P 500 is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, pricey compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Analysts on average expect fourth-quarter earnings to rise 6.1 percent compared to a year before, when slumping oil prices crippled energy companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. During the session, Amgen rose 2.7 percent after a U.S. district judge blocked Sanofi and Regeneron from selling their cholesterol drug, which Amgen said infringed its patents. Regeneron fell 5.3 percent and was the biggest percentage loser on the S&P 500. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.02-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.12-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 24 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 71 new highs and 14 new lows. Please Wait while comments are loading...

The iBoss had to live on a mere $8.7m 6 Jan 2017 at 20:52, Shaun Nichols Peak Apple With Apple revenues down, and the normally docile tech press finally turning on the iPhone maker, top executives at the Cupertino giant – including CEO Tim Cook – took a pay cut in 2016. In its annual filing with the SEC, Apple Inc reported that its CEO was hit with a 15 per cent pay cut last year. Steve Jobs' protege logged a base salary of $3m in 2016, while bonus pay tacked on another $5.7m. That is a drop from 2015, when Cook took home $10.2m, and 2014 when he made $9.2m. The drop in pay comes thanks to the slowdown in revenue growth at Apple. Even though Cook made more in base salary (he got just $2m in 2015), the bonus pay he received in 2016 was down 33 per cent from 2015, when Cook got an $8m bonus package. This as Apple has seen much of the luster wear off of its flagship iPhone lineup. With the market already saturated for smartphones, and production issues lingering, Apple saw a drop in phone sales for the first time in years, and overall revenues began to dip from their record highs a year ago. Don't feel too bad for Cook, however. His modest $8.7m take-home was fortified by a package of vesting stock options that netted him a cool $135m payout earlier in the year. Apple also shelled out $220,432 to cover Cook's security costs, $138,462 in vacation cash-out pay, $15,900 in contributions to Cook's 401k plan, and $2,925 to cover his life insurance premiums. Other Apple execs actually fared better than the CEO in 2016. CFO Luca Maestri, software head Eddy Cue, retail head Angela Ahrendts, hardware lead Dan Riccio, and general counsel Bruce Sewell all netted $20m stock awards from the company, in addition to their $1m salaries and $1.79m bonuses. Even Apple's board members took home a tidy pay package last year. Al Gore was given $352,492 for his time, while Bob Iger made $377,289, and James Bell pocketed $465,551. Sadly, Sir Jony Ive was not listed in the filing, so we can only speculate what the design guru gets paid to narrate watch ads these days. ® Sponsored: DevOps and continuous delivery Tips and corrections 31 Comments More from The Register Lenovo shows off 'Microsoft-friendly' VR cosplay at CES CES 2017 No actual demo, though.

A regulatory filing reveals Cook received $1.53 million less in 2016 than the previous year, as his incentive pay dropped from $10.3 million to $8.75 million. The decline in sales didn’t just affect Cook’s compensation, but a number of other high-level executives also suffered for Apple’s first annual revenue decline in 15 years. Scroll down for video  While Cook’s base salary did increase from $2 million in 2015 to $3 million last year, his ‘incentive plan compensation’ dropped from $8 million to $5.37 million. However, other executives saw a $2.21 million drop in this area from the previous year APPLE BY NUMBERS  A regulatory filing reveals that Apple CEO Tim Cook and other high-level executives also suffered from the firm's decline in sales.  Apple’s annual sales were 3.7 percent below its target of $223.6 billion, and its operating income of $60 billion was 0.5% short of the $60.3 billion target.  Cook received $1.53 million less in 2016 than the previous year – his incentive pay dropped from $10.3 million to $8.75 million.  However, other executives saw a $2.21 million drop in this area from the previous year.  The filing, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, also lists how badly of a year the Cupertino company had altogether. Apple’s annual sales were 3.7 percent below its target of $223.6 billion, and its operating income of $60 billion was 0.5% short of the $60.3 billion target. And as a result, the executives were only given 89.5 percent of their targeted annual cash incentive. While Cook’s base salary did increase from $2 million in 2015 to $3 million last year, his ‘incentive plan compensation’ dropped from $8 million to $5.37 million. His incentive pay may have taken a hit, but the CEO still took home a total of 11.74 million for 2016.  On the other hand, other executives saw a $2.21 million drop in this area from the previous year - but each took home more than 23 million in total.  A filing from August highlighted that Cook received 1.26 million Apple shares, valued at around $135 million at the time, that were previously restricted.

Share this article Share 84 shares He earned a majority of these shares by sitting as CEO for Apple for five years. And the reset were given to Cook because of Apple’s stock performance.  The drop in sales for 2016 may have been a result users being disappointed with the new iPhone 7 line - as it seems to be just a refreshed iPhone 6.  A regulatory filing (pictured) reveals Cook received $1.53 million less in 2016 than the previous year, as his incentive pay dropped from $10.3 million to $8.75 million. A number of other high-level executives also suffered for Apple’s first annual revenue decline in 15 years It was also found in a survey that Apple products only accounted for 44 percent of new smartphone and tablet activations in the week leading up to Christmas. And although that was more than double what Samsung had – Apple was still down by 5 percent from 2015. The iPhone 7 may have been a flop among the crowd, but the firm says the next smartphone will be 'the most radical design ever'. The iPhone 8 is set to be unveiled this year for the firm’s 10 year anniversary – so many iOS users are sure Apple will impress them with new cutting edge technology. Apple’s annual sales were 3.7 percent below its target of $223.6 billion, and its operating income of $60 billion was 0.5% short of the $60.3 billion target IPHONE 8 RUMORS   Several rumors have been circulating about the iPhone 8, and suggest the next device may have:  - Dual-lens 3D camera  - Augmented reality to generate real-time views of surroundings  - Curved glass casing - Plastic OLED screen  - Wireless charging  - A folding element - New 5 inch (12.7 centimeter) and 5.8 inch (14.7 centimeter) models  - A new 'pure white' model. An unnamed employee at an Apple site in Herzliya, Israel, where hardware is being developed for the iPhone 8, has leaked some details about the new handset in September 2016. The unnamed employee told Business Insider that the iPhone 8 would be 'different' from previous handsets, which have been critiqued as being too similar.  Until now, little has been known about Apple's next iPhone, although reports by a source speaking to Nikkei Asian Review have said that it will have a curved screen. If those rumors are true, the iPhone 8 could rival the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge which came out in February this year. The employee also mentioned that the iPhone 8 would have a better camera – although this usually happens with every update.    Read more: Apple is developing hardware for the 'iPhone 8' in Israel - Business Insider High-end iPhone to have Samsung-like curved OLED display in 2017: source- Nikkei Asian Review Apple CEO Cook¿s 2016 Pay Lower as Tech Giant Misses Targets - WSJ Share or comment on this article e-mail 84 shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany She's falling for him?

Apple climbed 1.1 per cent after Canada's Competition Bureau did not find sufficient evidence the iPhone maker had engaged in anti-competitive conduct, closing a two-year investigation into the company. Wall Street has been on a tear since Trump won the US election in November, with the Dow up 9 per cent as investors bet he will stimulate the economy with lower taxes and infrastructure spending. While Friday's gains suggested the rally was not yet over, some investors have grown cautious.

"But parabolic market advances traditionally experience digestion of these gains, and I don't think this time will be any different." The record trading session followed a US Labor Department report that showed the economy added fewer-than-expected jobs in December but wages increased, suggesting resilience in the labour market.

X Apple faces massive interest bill as Irish transfer nears NTMA understood to be involved in effort to recover Apple taxes Fri, Jan 6, 2017, 19:59 Joe Brennan Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, received the equivalent of $145 million (€137.3 million) in the year to September. Photograph: Kimberly White/Reuters         Apple is preparing to pay a massive interest bill into an escrow account in addition to €13 billion of back-taxes the European Commission says is owed to the Republic after finding last year the iPhone maker’s Irish tax affairs breached state-aid rules. feqr Having missed an initial deadline on Tuesday for the collection of the taxes and interest, even as Ireland and Apple are appealing the EU decision, State officials are seeking to finalise the matter within weeks with the technology company. Accountancy firm Grant Thornton estimated in August that the interest cost alone could run to €6 billion, based on rates applied by the Revenue Commissioners. However, sources said that the figure will be lower, and calculated according to a less onerous state-aid recovery rate formula. It is understood the National Treasury Management Agency will play a role in the collection of the money, given the size and complexity of the transaction. However, control of the funds will ultimately be the responsibility of a trustee, as the case winds its way through European courts, a process which could take up to six years. Actively managed The sheer amount involved means the funds cannot merely be transferred into a bank account. The money will have to be actively managed, according to sources, most likely along the lines of how Apple runs its own cash hoard, which grew to a record $237.6 billion at the end of its financial year in September. Inside China’s ‘iPhone City’, the land of sweeteners and perks John McManus: Apple’s adventures in tax wonderland Apple ruling: EU accuses Ireland of inconsistencies on tax rules Only €20.5 billion of Apple’s overall pool is made up of actual cash or cash equivalents, according to the latest annual report. The remainder is invested in corporate bonds, US and other government debts as well as mortgage- and other asset-backed securities. The group’s effective interest rate the entire portfolio last year was 1.73 per cent. ADVERTISEMENT A spokesman for the Department of Finance said that while Ireland missed last Tuesday’s initial deadline for collecting the Apple taxes and interest, the European Commission is satisfied with progress that has been made by the State and Apple on the matter. He declined to comment further. It is understood the payment will be made soon. Firstly, the Revenue Commissioners must align the EU’s formula of how much tax is owed between 2003 and 2014 with Irish tax law. An EU Commission spokeswoman said Brussels remains in contact with Irish authorities on the matter. A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment. Meanwhile, it emerged on Friday that Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, received the equivalent of $145 million (€137.3 million) in the year to September as he was given $137 million of previously-awarded share bonuses tied to his 2011 promotion to the top job. His actual remuneration for last year fell by $1.5 million to $8.75 million as the group missed its own sale and profit targets. Mr Cook this week declined an invitation to appear at the Oireachtas finance committee to discuss the EU ruling. Apple told the committee it didn’t want to “potentially prejudice future outcomes” of the case. The decision not to give testimony drew criticism from a number of TDs, including Fianna Fáil finance spokesman Michael McGrath and his Sinn Féin counterpart, Pearse Doherty, as well as the Labour Party’s Seán Sherlock.       Topics: Apple tax Michael Mcgrath Pearse Doherty Sean Sherlock Tim Cook Department of Finance Eu European Commission Fianna Fáil Labour National Treasury Management Agency Oireachtas Sinn Fein Read More Apple dismisses tax bill, says Ireland ‘doesn’t do any engineering for us’ Cliff Taylor: Battle lines drawn in State’s EU Apple appeal Court ruling on Spanish tax may give clues to Apple appeal Meet ‘the Maxforce’ – the EU team that fined Ireland €13bn over Apple Apple CEO invited to attend tax ruling hearing in Dublin EU Court asks Government to tweak its Apple tax appeal Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy Oxfam report reveals ‘obscene’ gap between rich and poor Retail & Services Irish retailers angry as State leaves them out in the cold Rugby Ulster unable to build on start as Exeter end European adventure Economy We could be looking at ‘hard Brexit’.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Pandora turns south as investors shrug off latest acquisition talk By Rex Crum / January 6, 2017 at 11:38 AM Another year…and another batch of speculation begins about the future of Pandora Media. The Oakland-based internet radio company is preparing to roll out its first true, on-demand streaming music service, dubbed Pandora Premium. With close to 80 million users, the majority of whom use Pandora’s free, ad-supported music-listening option, Pandora hopes to attract some of those listeners to Pandora Premium and its expected $10-a-month subscription fee. For that amount, listeners will get to search and play anything they can find, build their own playlists and take their music selections with them offline when the service launches, possibly in the first quarter of the year. It’s a big move for Pandora, which is trying to maintain its leadership position among internet music-streaming rivals such as Spotify and Apple Music. And when it happens, it will arrive on the heels of continuing talk that satellite-radio company Sirius XM may be interested in buying Pandora, and how Apple might benefit from acquiring one, if not both companies. The theory is that Apple, which is making services a bigger part of it future business efforts, would strengthen that side of its operations with Pandora under its wing. Apple has about 20 million paid subscribers to its Apple Music service, but Pandora has nearly four times as many members. In addition to its upcoming Pandora Premium service, Pandora recently launched Pandora Plus, a $4.99-a-month streaming option with no ads which allows for unlimited replays of songs. Again, those are paying customers that would give a boost to Apple’s services business. Pandora shares, however, fell more than 4 percent Friday, to $12.48. A drop like that suggests that the market isn’t putting much credence in the latest Pandora-as-an-acquisition speculation. After all, Pandora has a market capitalization of $2.88 billion. Any purchase would include a premium of, say 25 percent on top of that. That would bring the price tag, at least as of this writing, to $3.6 billion. The only time Apple paid anywhere near that amount for anything was when it wrote a $3 billion check for Beats back in 2014. Neil Doshi, an analyst with Mizuho Securities, said he met with Pandora’s management and investor relations teams at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week. Doshi said the potential for Pandora this year is high, but questions remain, especially with Pandora Premium still set to launch. Doshi said company officials mentioned they would be “disappointed” if Pandora added only 1 million Pandora Premium subscribers this year. Doshi believes Pandora Premium will add 1.25 million subscribers, but admitted that “expectations are low” ahead of its launch. “There could be upside, but we need to test the product to see how differentiated it is, and how well the product is resonating with users,” Doshi said. We’ll all have to wait a few more weeks for the latest update on what Pandora is hearing from its listeners. The company’s fourth-quarter results are likely to come out near the end of the month.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: The Dow came within one point of 20,000 for the first time on Friday and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 reached record highs, boosted by Apple, extending a two-month rally fueled by optimism about U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Apple climbed 1.1 percent after Canada's Competition Bureau did not find sufficient evidence the iPhone maker had engaged in anti-competitive conduct, closing a two-year investigation into the company. Wall Street has been on a tear since Trump won the U.S. election in November, with the Dow up 9 percent as investors bet he will stimulate the economy with lower taxes and infrastructure spending. While Friday's gains suggested the rally was not yet over, some investors have grown cautious. "The market's advance is understandable because of the economic stimulus optimism associated with a new Trump presidency," said CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall. "But parabolic market advances traditionally experience digestion of these gains, and I don't think this time will be any different." The record trading session followed a U.S. Labor Department report that showed the economy added fewer-than-expected jobs last month but wages increased, suggesting resilience in the labor market. Stocks did not react significantly to a report that five people were dead in a shooting at Florida's Fort Lauderdale airport. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 64.51 points, or 0.32 percent, to end at 19,963.8 points. The index rose as high as 19,999.63 but lost ground. Goldman Sachs rose 1.48 percent, helping the Dow more than any other stock. The S&P 500 gained 7.98 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,276.98, its highest close ever. The Nasdaq Composite added 33.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,521.06, also a record. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, led by the technology sector's 0.96 percent gain. For the week, the Dow rose 1 percent while the S&P gained 1.7 percent and the Nasdaq jumped 2.6 percent. INVESTORS EYE EARNINGS The strength of fourth-quarter earnings reports from U.S. companies over the next few weeks will be closely watched by investors eyeing high stock valuations. Following its recent gains, the S&P 500 is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, pricey compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Analysts on average expect fourth-quarter earnings to rise 6.1 percent compared to a year before, when slumping oil prices crippled energy companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. During the session, Amgen rose 2.48 percent after a U.S. district judge blocked Sanofi and Regeneron from selling their cholesterol drug, which Amgen said infringed its patents. Regeneron fell 5.84 percent and was the biggest percentage loser on the S&P 500. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.11-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.21-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 24 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 76 new highs and 15 new lows. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, a bit under the 6.7 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Before the iPhone was released in 2007, Apple tested an interface that was completely different from what we know today. Rather than a home screen filled with icons, the Cupertino company built an operating system, dubbed AcornOS, that looked more like what was available on iPods. Sonny Dickson released a video of AcornOS in action, which shows an on-screen click wheel used to navigate the OS. It’s unclear how seriously Apple considered the software, but thank goodness it was never released. The click wheel was good for its time but it’s not particular elegant on a larger touch screen device, and the menu-oriented UI is a bit of a mess. Something as simple as showing missed calls takes a lot of scrolling, and it’s not particularly nice to look at. There are no icons and the click wheel takes up half of the screen. AcornOS looks more like something that was used internally rather than software that was seriously considered for release. However, Dickson does point to a patent Apple files in 2006 for a “multi-functional handheld device,” which would have included a click wheel. Basically, exactly what we’re seeing in the video above. Was AcornOS really a thing? It’s unclear what device Dickson is using AcornOS on, or how he obtained it, but it shows off a never-before-seen part of Apple’s history. As MacRumors notes, former Apple CEO Steve Jobs put Tony Fadell, who created the iPod, and Macintosh executive, Scott Forstall, in a head-to-head competition to come up with a mobile OS for the iPhone. Obviously, Forstall and his team won, although he is no longer with the company. Check out the video above to see what may have been.

Earnings: Mark Your Calendar Can Apple finally return to growth? Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Jan 6, 2017 at 3:31PM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will announce the results for its important holiday quarter on Jan. 31, according to an updated schedule on the company's website. Investors will undoubtedly be watching the update closely. Apple's fiscal first quarter of 2017, ending Dec. 31, marked the first full quarter of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus availability. Will the new iPhone help Apple return to revenue growth? Ahead of the earnings release, here's an early look at some of the key metrics worth looking into. iPhone 7. Image source: Apple. Revenue Apple's fiscal 2016 marked a rare year-over-year decline in revenue for the company. Sales during the fiscal year were about $217 billion, down about 8% from Apple's record $234 billion in revenue during fiscal 2015. The company's inability to grow its top line has suppressed the stock's valuation as investors wonder if Apple can grow from here. Apple stock currently has a price-to-earnings ratio of just 14 -- wildly low for an established market leader as dominant as Apple. Still, some investors may be hoping Apple can either turn revenue around during fiscal 2017 -- or at least put a stop to top-line declines. Investor hope for a return to growth is actually encouraged by Apple management; the company guided for fiscal 2017 first-quarter revenue between $76 and $78 billion, representing a slight uptick from Apple's $75.9 billion of revenue in the year-ago quarter. Investors may be hoping Samsung's recall of its Note 7 during the holiday quarter will serve as a catalyst for Apple's September-launched iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. With Samsung's flagship smartphones clearly standing out as the biggest competition to Apple's iPhones -- especially in the U.S. -- the Note 7's recall should have helped drive some incremental iPhone sales during the quarter. And since iPhone accounts for about 60% of Apple's total revenue, a solid quarter for iPhone should make a return to growth more likely. Earnings per share Another key area to watch will be Apple's earnings per share. But investors shouldn't expect the metric to return to growth the way revenue could. Even if revenue turns upward, Apple is expecting a lower gross profit margin in its first quarter than it sported in the year-ago quarter; a lower gross profit margin on only a slight uptick in revenue would likely mean EPS for the quarter will still be lower than in the year-ago quarter. Apple store. Image source: The Motley Fool. Apple said it's expecting a gross profit margin between 38% and 38.5% for its first quarter. In the year-ago quarter, Apple's gross profit margin was 40.1%. Importantly, as investors digest the quarter's results, investors should keep in mind that even if Apple's EPS declines on a year-over-year basis because of a narrower gross profit margin, worsening profitability will likely mostly be attributable to factors unrelated to Apple's regular operations. In the year-ago quarter, Apple's gross profit margin benefited from a $548 million award for patent infringement. Further, Apple's guidance for a 38% to 38.5% first-quarter gross profit margin takes into account expectations for 60 to 70 basis points of currency headwinds. Whatever EPS Apple reports, it would likely be worth investors' time to look for an explanation from management about what factors drove EPS higher or lower (probably lower) during the quarter. For a reference point, the consensus analyst estimates for Apple's revenue and EPS during the quarter are $77.4 billion and $3.22, respectively. This would compare to revenue and EPS of $75.9 billion and $3.28, respectively, in the year-ago quarter. Apple will release its first-quarter financial results after market close on Jan. 31.

Twitter Facebook Microsoft’s OS supremacy over Apple to end in 2017 Gartner forecasts Windows device shipments will falter, then flatten; iOS and macOS will overtake, extend lead in 2018-19 Gregg Keizer (Computerworld (US)) 07 January, 2017 07:07 - - - - print email Comments Apple will steal a march on Microsoft this year when for the first time this century shipments of devices powered by its operating systems outnumber those running Windows, research firm Gartner said today. In 2017, Apple's combination of iOS and macOS -- the former on iPhones and iPads, the latter on Macs -- will take second place from Windows on the devices shipped during the year. The gap between the two will widen in 2018 and 2019, with Apple ahead of Microsoft both years. According to Gartner, which provided Computerworld with its latest device shipment forecast broken out by operating system, in 2016 Windows powered about 260 million devices of the 2.3 billion shipped during the year. Windows accounted for approximately 11.2% of the total devices, which overwhelmingly ran Google's Android. Meanwhile, iOS and macOS -- the latter was formerly dubbed OS X -- sank to 248 million devices in 2016, a 10% drop from the year prior. The cause: Slackened sales of the iPhone, Apple's dominant device and biggest money maker. Gartner predicted that iOS + macOS, unlike Windows, will recover in 2017. Apple's OSes will climb 8% to 268 million this year, add 3% in 2018 to reach 276 million, then increase another 3% in 2019, with that year's device shipment forecast at 285 million. Windows will dip this year, then stagnate for the following two years. Microsoft's operating system will power about 252 million devices shipped in 2017 -- the bulk of them personal computers -- for a year-over-year decline of 3%. Windows will account for 253 million devices in 2018 (for a near-zero growth rate) and 257 million devices in 2019 (an annual growth rate of 1.8%). The gap between Microsoft and Apple -- 12 million last year, with Microsoft atop -- will widen to 27 million by 2019, advantage Apple. Gartner's forecast was another gloomy report on almost every device category, with shipments flat this year compared to last and growth not projected until 2018. "The global devices market is stagnating," said Gartner analyst Ranjit Atwal in a statement Wednesday. Mobile phone shipments are growing only in emerging markets in the Asia and Pacific markets, Atwal added, and noted that, "The PC market is just reaching the bottom of its decline." The PC industry's troubles have affected Microsoft most of all; Windows is almost entirely dependent on PC shipments, which have been stuck in a protracted slump. Future shipments were further hit when Microsoft walked away from the smartphone business last year. Gartner pegged total shipments of PC-like devices at 268 million for 2016, a 7% contraction from the year before, and contrary to an October forecast, now says shipments would again decline in 2017, dropping 0.7% to 266 million. Circumstances will improve only marginally in the two years following, as shipments rise to 272 million in 2018 and 278 million in 2019. The new normal is a sub-300 million market. PCs will not disappear -- something some pundits fretted about as the sales and shipment downturn extended past earlier records -- but the business has been hard hit: In 2012, for instance, more than 350 million PC-like devices shipped globally. Gartner is still betting that a PC replacement cycle will boost shipments, even if only slightly. But this week's forecast -- unlike the one in October -- predicted a delayed growth. In October, Gartner had said the PC business would claw its way back into the black in 2017; this month's prognosis is that growth won't occur until 2018. Most analysts have essentially written off growth in the consumer portion of the PC market; instead, they expect that any gains will come from commercial customers, who still rely on personal computers, as they try to transition from Windows 7 to the newer Windows 10 before Microsoft retires the former in three years. Computerworld (Data: Gartner) Microsoft's decades-long operating system supremacy over Apple will end in 2017, according to Gartner Research, as iOS and macOS power more devices shipped than does Windows.

(AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, File) By Michelle Quinn | PUBLISHED: January 6, 2017 at 11:52 am | UPDATED: January 7, 2017 at 8:05 am When Apple introduced the iPhone 10 years ago this week, skeptics pounced. Sure, the iPhone was a bright, shiny object, another product that crazed Apple lovers would line up to buy, as they always did. But the phone was a hodgepodge, a Swiss Army knife of functions trying to do too much, critics said. It had no stylus, no keyboard buttons, no secure email for business users. People would never type long emails on it. One analyst predicted “a backlash of sorts as people figure out how much this thing doesn’t do.” Related Articles 10 years of iPhones: A timeline of evolution Apple hit with wide-ranging lawsuits from Nokia over iPhones, iPads, iPods, computers, watches Biz Break: Apple boasts of big App Store business The iPhone’s biggest booster, then-Apple CEO Steve Jobs, knew the device’s potential as he took the stage in San Francisco on Jan. 9, 2007.  “Every once in awhile, a revolutionary product comes along that changes the world,” he said. “Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone.” Jobs turned out to be right. The iPhone was the device that “conditioned us to expect to be connected to the global network every moment of the day,” said Paul Saffo, a longtime tech industry observer. And that conditioning changed everything. The following year, Apple created the iPhone App Store, a centralized market that opened up the device to software developers. Meanwhile, other smartphone manufacturers like HTC and Samsung sold their own handsets with multitouch interfaces relying on Google’s Android operating system. They, too, opened app stores. Today, more than two-thirds of Americans carry a smartphone, up six percent from the prior year, according to eMarketer. With smartphone apps, people call an Uber, find a date through Tinder, look for jobs on LinkedIn, watch videos on YouTube, play Angry Birds, control their home thermostats and so on. Our smartphones have become so critical to our lives that there’s an app for finding a lost or stolen one. The iPhone (along with its smartphone competitors) has gone from being “a fetish to the tool for mediating modern life,” said Mike McGuire, a vice president of research at Gartner. (In 2007 at the iPhone unveiling, he came close to conveying what would happen, telling me, “once you have the thing, you will want to carry it all the time.”) To test how deeply embedded smartphones are, try to live without one. Turning it off while camping or out at sea doesn’t count. When I recently destroyed my iPhone in the rain, I managed to stay calm with some deep breathing. It was a Saturday. I’d be fine turning to my laptop for email and doing internet searches. I have a house phone. “Look at me, I can function without a smartphone,” I thought. “It’s still possible.” That was the first hour. Without Maps or Waze, Google’s navigation app, I got lost picking up my daughter at a school across town. I couldn’t look up the address or text anyone to help. I drove around in concentric circles hoping to stumble on where I needed to go. In the end, I had to wave down a mail deliverer. If anyone still knew their way without a smartphone, she would. Yes, it’s ridiculous how much many of us rely on this thing now but oh well. Still, there are downsides to this always-connected life. More than 70 percent of smartphone owners sleep with them. France recently passed a law affirming the right of workers to disconnect, not answer emails, when they are on personal time. “That came as a result, I would argue, from smartphones,” said McGuire. Texting while driving has become a serious public health issue. And, we are still trying to figure out etiquette rules for using smartphones.

The iPhone outstripped all expectations and became Apple’s largest source of revenue. Yet its 10th anniversary comes at a time when the iPhone itself is no longer a status symbol. To the untrained eye, an iPhone, a Samsung Galaxy or another Android-based phone like the OnePlus look much the same, especially in protection cases. “Each device matters less and less,” said Bob O’Donnell, president and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research. “We’ve passed peak smartphone.” That has hit Apple. In 2016, iPhone sales slumped, leading the company to cut 15 percent from the pay of Tim Cook, its CEO, for missing performance goals. The smartphone market may be saturated, with people holding on to their old ones longer. What matters more are the services. The devices themselves have become more like vessels than status symbols. Technological advancements, even from Apple, are incremental now, tweaks that fans cheer but that aren’t creating new markets. Is that a problem for Apple and the entire tech industry? Maybe. “We need new inflection points,” said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, who told me in 2007 that with the iPhone Apple “may have created a new category.” “An anniversary is a good time to introduce inflection points for the industry’s growth,” he said. Whatever comes next, we probably won’t fully understand its impact at first. It seems to take us a decade to figure out how the next new thing will fit in our life. But when we do, we don’t let go.   Tags:  Apple Business Columnists iPhone Steve Jobs Michelle Quinn Michelle Quinn is a former business columnist for the Bay Area News Group.

The Dow Jones industrial average came within a fraction of a point of the 20,000-point mark early Friday afternoon, just short of the historic milestone as it continued to rally on the strengthening economy and optimism about the upcoming Trump presidency. The blue-chip index reached an intraday high of 19,999.63 — within 0.37 points of the millennial milestone — at 12:43 p.m. before pulling back and closing at 19,963.80, its second-highest finish ever. While the Dow missed its mark, other major averages set new records. The S&P 500, a broader gauge of US companies, closed at 2,276.98, its all-time high. The Nasdaq closed at 5,007.08, also its best-ever close. Traders took an upbeat view of jobs data released by the government that showed wages grew the most since 2009 — even while job creation had slowed in December. “The catalyst today was the wages,” Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial, told The Post. “This report showed wages up and clearly the market liked that.“ But strong wage growth was tempered by lukewarm job numbers. The unemployment rate rose to 4.7 percent from 4.6 percent. A shooting in the Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., airport that left at least five dead also spooked the market. The Dow has soared 9.1 percent, or more than 1,667 points, since Election Day — just 40 trading days ago — on a mix of enthusiasm about the president-elect’s economic and tax policies and an improving housing market, falling unemployment, and the rising price of oil. On Nov. 22, less than two weeks after Trump’s surprise win, the Dow crossed the 19,000 mark for the first time. FindTheCompany | Graphiq Market strategists acknowledged that the 20K milestone is as much a psychological barrier as it was based on market fundamentals. During the last two weeks of the year, while trading volume was low and there was little market-related news that could have influenced the markets, the Dow stayed within a trading range just below 20,000. The optimism over Trump’s policies that had driven the markets up higher had started to wane as investors wanted to see more specifics on tax reform and deregulation, Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, told The Post at the time. Friday was no smoother. The Dow dropped about 60 points in early morning trading before rebounding in the late morning. Goldman Sachs was the Dow’s biggest gainer of the day, rising as much as 1.7 percent in the mid-afternoon to $246.05, thanks to a selloff in government bonds that sent yields higher. “Financial [stocks] are the direct beneficiary of the higher yield,” Krosby said, since banks base some interest rates, like mortgages, on the yield of government bonds.

The store will be placed in Seoul, Korea, near Samsung’s HQ (via Reuters). “We’re excited about opening our first Apple Store in Korea, one of the world’s economic centers and a leader in telecommunication and technology, with a vibrant K-culture,” Apple told Reuters in a statement Friday. “We’re now hiring the team that will offer our customers in Seoul the service, education and entertainment that is loved by Apple customers around the world.” However, Apple has not commented on an earlier rumor. The rumor said that the Apple Store would be right across the street from Samsung’s HQ, close to Gangnam Station. Local news agencies have reported that construction has already begun ‘in a southern district of Seoul.’ Apple declined to comment on its location.

"But parabolic market advances traditionally experience digestion of these gains, and I don't think this time will be any different." The first record high of the year for the S&P 500 follows a U.S. Labor Department report that showed the economy added fewer-than-expected jobs last month but wages increased, suggesting resilience in the labor market.At 2:14 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was up 94.45 points, or 0.47 percent, to 19,993.74 points. The index rose to as high as 19,999.63.The S&P 500 .SPX had gained 12.83 points, or 0.56 percent, to 2,281.83 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC had added 47.16 points, or 0.86 percent, to 5,535.09. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, led by the technology sector's .SPLRCT 1.12 percent gain.Amgen (AMGN.O) rose 3 percent after a U.S. district judge blocked Sanofi (SASY.PA) and Regeneron (REGN.O) from selling their cholesterol drug, which Amgen said infringed its patents. Regeneron was off 5.4 percent and was the biggest percentage loser on the S&P. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.19-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.05-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted 24 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 70 new highs and 12 new lows.

The late Steve Jobs took $1-a-year salary from 1997 to 2011, though he did own more than 5million Apple shares. Other top bosses saw their bonuses cut last year. Read More Apple AirPod owners are disguising their expensive earphones as packets of dental floss Tim Cook's salary was £7.1million and he had stock options worth £110million Apple said: “Cash incentives to our executive officers reflected results with below-target payouts.” Earlier this year Tim defended sales of the Apple smartwatch, claiming it was on track for a record quarter after an independent analyst reported a significant decline in sales. IDC released a report, stating that Apple had sold 1.1 million Watches in the third quarter 2016, giving it a 4.9% share of the wearable technology market.

IDC noted that Apple's decision to launch its second-generation watches in mid-September, towards the end of the quarter, did contribute to its year-over-year decline. In an email sent to a Reuters reporter , Apple chief Tim Cook refuted the claims, stating that the current quarter is on track to be the best ever for the product.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Nowhere is it more prevalent than at CES that Microsoft is eating Apple’s lunch. I wrote a bit about this a few weeks ago, when I made the argument that Apple’s lost. We haven’t seen much in the way of groundbreaking innovations from Apple, at least in terms of things that other companies haven’t done or aren’t capable of doing, since the introduction of the iPhone and iPad. Meanwhile, at CES, it’s becoming more and more clear that Microsoft and its partners are now innovating more than ever. Rebirth of Windows excitement It’s been a long, long time since I’ve been as excited about new Windows machines as I am now. There are amazing new products from HP, Lenovo, Samsung and other Microsoft partners on display at the show. From what I can tell, the costs are coming down drastically while the choices are increasing. You’ll find all sorts of sizes, configurations and form factors. Desktops and laptops. Gaming machines and productivity choices. Apple hasn’t ever had this benefit, but one might also make the argument that Apple was once able to succeed, especially in previous years, where Microsoft and its partners had failed. In other words, Windows 10 has been able to breathe new life into laptops that had otherwise been left for dead running Windows 8. AR, VR and MR Microsoft and its partners aren’t just talking PCs, though. They’re also talking about virtual reality, mixed virtual reality and augmented reality at CES. Lenovo has its new virtual reality headset on display. It’s still unnamed, but the company says it plans to sell it for under $400, far less than the cost of Oculus or the Vive, and with the promise to offer similar performance. Microsoft told me there will be various price ranges, a “good, better, best” if you will, of these sorts of products. Even more compelling – Microsoft only had to do the legwork on the back-end, adding support into Windows 10, instead of actually needing to build the products itself. Investors sure must be happy it’s not taking unnecessary hardware risks. Foundation for Home Assistants It’s also clear Microsoft is starting to lay the groundwork for connected home assistants. I’m not 100 percent sure that we’re going to see a Cortana “Echo” type of device, the sort that Amazon offers just with Cortana instead of Alexa, but it seems more and more plausible. We can see, as is the case with AR/VR, that Microsoft’s partners are willing to build those types of new and exciting products. And we know that there’s interest. Indeed, Lenovo has an Amazon Echo product dubbed the Lenovo Smart Assistant on display at the show. One can just as easily imagine that it would make a lot of sense for Microsoft to push out the support for its partners to build Cortana into similar devices, tying them right into Windows 10 products around the home. Connected Cars We also know that Apple is struggling with its car project. The opposite is true of what Microsoft’s doing at CES 2017. Microsoft unveiled its Connected Vehicle Platform, built on Microsoft Azure cloud, during the show. It’s designed for next-generation connected vehicles. Partners such as BMW are tapping Microsoft for BMW Connected. Volvo is using Microsoft’s Skype platform in its XC90, S90 and V90, with suggestions that Cortana is coming, too. Microsoft isn’t new to the automobile space, it’s only pushing forward. A mobile vision The argument could certainly be made that Apple still has a great upper-cut when it comes to mobile, but Microsoft is advancing there, too. It announced initiatives at WinHEC last month with Qualcomm (perhaps much to the chagrin of Intel) to run Windows 10 on Qualcomm processors. That should mean a new series of connected devices, tablets and perhaps one day even another stab at Windows 10 on phones. In the meantime, we’re also seeing Microsoft continuing to build great apps – Office, Wunderlist, Outlook, etc – for iOS and Android, allowing its customers to access Microsoft products on all platforms. I haven’t said Apple is dying and I don’t think it’s even heading down that path. But I think there’s always some sort of misconception that Apple’s doing all sorts of innovation while Microsoft lumbers along. I’ve already argued that much change is afoot at Microsoft, and indeed we’re starting to see a lot of that come into the hands of consumers. Most importantly, Microsoft’s employees are excited Even here at CES 2017 as I met with Microsoft executives, there seems to be a renewed sense of excitement for the company’s future, a fresh outlook and positive morale, something that wasn’t as noticeable in the days of Windows 8 and during the mishaps of Microsoft’s acquisition of Nokia. I’m glad to see it and, whether we all see it or not, a lot of the excitement at CES 2017 is being driven by Microsoft. Has Apple gone rotten? Business Apple is lost I was sitting on my couch last night flipping through Apple’s new “Apple TV” app, which I’ve already called a “smoking hot pile of garbage,” when I realized that I think Apple is really lost right now.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: European Parliament More like this Tim Cook's 2015 pay package climbs 12% to $10.3M 25 CIO pay packages revealed Apple CEO Tim Cook's 2012 comp package plummets Video Smart Cities: New York Apple CEO Tim Cook's total compensation took a dive for 2016, as the company missed its financial targets for the year. The company's earnings for the year to Sept. 24 dropped 14 percent compared to a year earlier. As a result, Cook's total compensation dropped 15 percent -- despite a 50 percent rise in base salary. He certainly won't have to start eating ramen noodles -- he made $8,747,719, after all -- but he and fellow senior executives lost out on a few million each because of the poor performance. Cook's compensation consists of a base salary and an annual cash incentive that can reach be worth four times base salary if the company's revenue and earnings exceed the maximum goals set, as they did in 2015 when Cook received $10.28 million, including $280,000 in "other" compensation. In 2016, in contrast, the incentive was only 1.79 times base salary, according to documents Apple filed with the SEC on Friday. Luckily for Cook, that $1 million pay rise at the start of the year also receives the multiplier: Without that, he would have made less than $5 million in total. Apple also provided compensation details for five other executives in its filing: They all made more than Cook. The five were CFO Luca Maestri, senior vice president for retail Angela Ahrendts; SVP for internet software and services Eddy Cue; SVP for hardware engineering Dan Riccio; and general counsel Bruce Sewell. Each had a base salary of $1 million, the same as last year, an annual incentive of $1.79 million, and stock awards of $20 million. That puts total compensation for each of the five senior executives at around $22.8 million, down from $25 million the previous year. Cook didn't receive any additional stock awards in 2016 -- but he's still profiting from the award he received in 2011, when he became CEO. In August 2016, the first 1.26 million of those stock units vested was worth $136 million. And there's more to come: Another 2.1 million units that have not yet vested will net Cook a further $237 million (at their current price) when they do. Of course, those compensation numbers are all provisional: They still require shareholder approval, something the board is recommending. It is also proposing that shareholders continue to approve executive pay every year, rather than every two or three years, as they might also choose to do.

Technology Apple Flirts With Buy, Alphabet Breaks Out, Joining Netflix, As Big Techs Lead REINHARDT KRAUSE 1/06/2017 Reprints Loading the player... Apple (AAPL) flirted with a buy point Friday while Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) broke out, joining Netflix (NFLX), which retreated even as an analyst mulled a Walt Disney (DIS) bid for the video streamer. Shares of Amazon.com (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) also gained, in a second straight good day for the closely watched stocks of the FANG tech giants, along with Apple. The big-cap tech advance was a key reason why the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average all set record highs Friday, with the blue-chip Dow coming within one point intraday of 20,000. Apple In the stock market today, Apple rose 1.1% to 117.91 after rising intraday to 118.16, briefly eclipsing a buy point of 118.12 out of a cup-with-handle base. Volume was average. Apple disclosed that CEO Tim Cook's 2016 base compensation declined after the iPhone maker missed its revenue and profit goals for the year. But as Bloomberg reported, 1.26 million shares that he was awarded when he was promoted to the top spot have vested, bringing his total compensation to his highest yet, at nearly $145 million. Apple stock has been basing over the past nine weeks, and is trading near a 13-month high. Apple reports fiscal Q1, December-quarter earnings on Jan. 31 after the close. IBD'S TAKE: Netflix has been on Leaderboard, IBD's premium service with annotated charts of leading stocks, mostly at or near buy zones. Take a free trial of Leaderboard to see the entire list of top stocks. Alphabet Alphabet stock climbed 1.5% to 825.21, slightly above a 824.40 buy point from a handle in its recent consolidation. Volume about average. Credit Suisse on Friday named Facebook and Google as its top two picks in consumer internet stocks. Credit Suisse has a price target of 1,120 on Google stock and expects upside from YouTube and its cloud computing business. Netflix Netflix stock fell 0.6% to 131.07, still in a buy zone after breaking out of its cup-with-handle base at a 129.40 buy point on Wednesday. An RBC Capital analyst who upgraded Walt Disney to buy on Friday says the Mouse could divest some assets to help finance a bid for Netflix, which has a market cap of about $57 billion. "Investors have asked us extensively whether Disney is set to do transformative M&A, especially Netflix," said Steven Cahall, an RBC analyst, in a research report. "M&A discussion may increasingly include the prospects of divestiture, as the cash generated could go a long way toward assuaging fears around the price paid for a company with an internet multiple. "We think that any major deal would be scrutinized heavily by investors, but we also think the bias is positive given the impressive deals undertaken under Bob Iger to create and leverage world-class intellectual property." A UBS analyst with a neutral rating cautioned on Friday that Netflix may not have enough near-term programming hits to sustain subscriber-growth estimates. Walt Disney shares rose 1.5% Friday, extending its recent breakout. Amazon Amazon stock was up 2% to 795.99 after rising 3.1% on Thursday. Amazon stock has moved above its 50-day moving average, a key support level, and has a buy point of 847.31. The e-commerce giant has basked in positive media coverage of its Alexa smart-home partnerships forged at CES, the big consumer electronics trade show under way this week in Las Vegas. Amazon has announced several deals to integrate Alexa — an artificial intelligence-driven voice assistant — into consumer devices. Amazon is competing with Google, Apple and others to develop smart home ecosystems for the "Internet of Things." Meanwhile, more data confirmed that online sales boomed during the holidays while brick-and-mortar stores floundered. Facebook Facebook stock advanced 2.3% to 123.41, after rising 1.7% on Thursday, when it moved above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages for the first time in two months. Facebook has a buy point of 133.60. Credit Suisse, which has a PT of 170, says Facebook street models are too conservative and underestimate the long-term monetization potential of upcoming new products from Instagram and WhatsApp. RELATED: Amazon Alexa, Vocal Computing Heard At CES REINHARDT KRAUSE | Facebook | @IBD_RKrause Share this: Related news Apple, Google, Netflix Are In Buy Range; Amazon, Facebook Near Breakouts 11:11 AM ET It's been a FANG-tastic start to the new year, with Netflix, Alphabet and Apple breaking out, and Amazon and Facebook... 11:11 AM ET It's been a FANG-tastic start to the new year, with...

Apple rose 1.3 percent, helping all three major indexes, after Canada's Competition Bureau said it did not find sufficient evidence iPhone maker had engaged in anti-competitive conduct, closing a two-year investigation into the company. U.S. stocks have risen sharply since Trump won the U.S. election in November and while Friday's additional gains suggested the rally is not yet over, some investors have grown cautious. "The market's advance is understandable because of the economic stimulus optimism associated with a new Trump presidency," said CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall. "But parabolic market advances traditionally experience digestion of these gains, and I don't think this time will be any different." The first record high of the year for the S&P 500 follows a U.S. Labor Department report that showed the economy added fewer-than-expected jobs last month but wages increased, suggesting resilience in the labor market. At 2:14 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 94.45 points, or 0.47 percent, to 19,993.74 points. The index rose to as high as 19,999.63. The S&P 500 had gained 12.83 points, or 0.56 percent, to 2,281.83 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 47.16 points, or 0.86 percent, to 5,535.09. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, led by the technology sector's 1.12 percent gain. Amgen rose 3 percent after a U.S. district judge blocked Sanofi and Regeneron from selling their cholesterol drug, which Amgen said infringed its patents. Regeneron was off 5.4 percent and was the biggest percentage loser on the S&P. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.19-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.05-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 24 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 70 new highs and 12 new lows.

The move brings to an end the investigation that began over two years ago when the Competition Bureau ordered disclosures from Apple Canada and several wireless carriers in separate court filings outlining concerns that Apple had been unfairly using its iPhone bargaining power to encourage carriers to overprice rival phones or charge higher fees for related wireless services. The Bureau reports that in examining the contracts between Apple Canada and the various Canadian wireless carriers, it “did not find sufficient evidence to conclude that Apple has engaged in an abuse of dominance under the Competition Act” and released a position statement on its website detailing the Bureau’s investigation.

(Carl Court/Getty Images) Related Stories Court orders Apple to hand over files to Competition Bureau Competition Bureau looking into Apple's iPhone contracts with Canadian carriers Canada's competition watchdog is dropping its investigation into Apple's iPhone contracts with the country's wireless carriers. The regulator launched the probe in 2014 after it received information suggesting Apple's agreements with the Canadian carriers imposed potentially anti-competitive sales and marketing requirements. But the federal agency says it hasn't found sufficient evidence that Apple's contract terms had a significant effect on competition. The bureau says the evidence suggests the contracts don't prevent carriers or rival smartphone makers from adopting measures that offset the impact of Apple's terms. It also noted the market share of different manufacturers can fluctuate as new devices are released and that a number of players have entered and left the smartphone market since the iPhone came to Canada in 2008. However, the bureau says if new information comes to light it will not hesitate to take action. © The Canadian Press, 2017 Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Latest Business Headlines Market forces align against oilsands though innovation promises an upside January 15, 5:00 AM ET read comments Typing in 'the zone': Why the physical QWERTY keyboard still matters to some January 15, 11:44 AM ET read comments audio Moving nightmares and cremation questions: CBC Marketplace's consumer cheat sheet January 15, 1:38 PM ET Enlisting Alberta First Nations to bolster pipeline monitoring January 15, 2:51 PM ET How a small southern Alberta town became a drone hotspot January 15, 4:45 PM ET audio Must Watch Video Dairy practices protest 5:11 Michael Dykes, president and CEO of the International Dairy Foods Association, on U.S. complaint over Canadian dairy pricing Video The Ticker 10:24 Ian Lee, associate professor, Sprott School of Business, talks about some of the big stories of the day Video Trump tax policy 6:44 Jack Mintz of the University of Calgary on what big U.S. tax cuts could do to Canadian competitiveness Video Partnering with robots 6:46 Michael Chui, Partner, McKinsey Global Institute, on tasks that we can pass along to robots Watch The Exchange here Watch Recent shows and interviews Recent discussions about business news and newsmakers Markets TSX COMPOSITE   Rotate stock indices Pause stock rotation Show previous stock PLAY Jan 15, 2017 12:00 AM ET Jan 15, 2017 12:00 AM ET Jan 15, 2017 12:00 AM ET Jan 15, 2017 12:00 AM ET Jan 15, 2017 12:00 AM ET Index Last Trade Change TSX COMPOSITE 15497.28 79.12 DOW 19885.73 -5.27 NASDAQ 5574.12 26.63 SP 500 2274.64 4.20 TSX-VENTURE 794.51 4.87 The data on this site is informational only and may be delayed; it is not intended as trading or investment advice and you should not rely on it as such.

Twitter Facebook Hands on: Apple's AirPods are indeed 'magical' The new wireless headphones do a lot of things right, but they're not without flaws Michael deAgonia (Computerworld (US)) 07 January, 2017 05:03 - - - - print email Comments There's a lot to like about Apple's new wireless AirPods. From the ease of the initial setup to the small carrying case that doubles as a charger to the sound quality of the speakers and directional mics, the AirPods do a lot of things right -- elegantly, even -- yet they are not entirely without flaws. The $159 wireless headphones were announced back in September, but didn't start shipping until last month and were quickly backordered. Only recently have customers actually started receiving them and they're still a rare find at Apple Stores. (Buying directly from Apple's online store means a six week wait before the order ships.) Apple Store employees have told me that they receive daily shipments, and sell out quickly. Your best bet if you want a pair sooner rather than later is to track availability at your local Apple Store via iStockNow.com. That's what I did just before Christmas. I was able to use the Apple Store iPhone app to purchase my pair on Dec. 21 from the Providence Place Apple Store in Rhode Island as soon as iStockNow's availability indicator lit up green. Within a minute, that store was out of stock. Open box, easy setup In the box is the pair of AirPods, the small white carrying case that doubles as a charger, a Lightning-to-USB cable similar (if not identical) to the one that ships with iPhones and basic documentation -- a small foldout pamphlet with simple instructions for pairing and using the AirPods. Adam Patrick Murray AirPods are compatible with iOS devices capable of running iOS 10, any Mac capable of running macOS Sierra, and any Apple Watch running watchOS 3. To work seamlessly between devices, all must share the same iCloud account. Using the same iCloud account is part of what allows Apple to boast they're "magical;" it makes setup a breeze. Once the AirPods are paired up with one of your Apple devices, they're paired up with all your devices sharing the same iCloud account. AirPod setup is as follows: unlock your iPhone, open the lid of the AirPod carrying case within a couple of inches of the iPhone, and tap Connect on the iPhone's screen. That's it. Your iPhone -- and now, every Apple device you own -- can use your AirPods. This is possible because they use Apple's custom W1 chipset. It piggy-backs on the existing Bluetooth protocol and means AirPods are compatible with anything that can stream through Bluetooth, including Android phones. The W1 chipset doesn't just help with pairing, though; it is designed to help maintain a stable connection to each individual AirPod while maintaining about five hours of continuous battery life. (Editor's note: The W1 chip is also used in several new Beats headphones and allows the same easy setup and lengthy battery time.) The AirPods represent Apple's follow-up to the elimination of the analog audio jack in the iPhone 7. In addition to providing a dongle if you need to connect an older pair of headphones, Apple rolled out new technology that improves on current wireless implementations. Notice that I said improved, not perfected. But we'll get to that in a bit. Fit, feel and sound The AirPods are in-ear, but they aren't the type that squeezes into your ear canal. This means wearing them doesn't block ambient noise. Initially, I used the AirPods one at a time while doing chores or fixing computers at work. But I've found that even with both AirPods in, hearing your surroundings isn't a challenge if the volume is kept low. The speakers have a good range of volume and a pretty good balance of highs, lows, and mids. Bass is, well, bass is bass on a tinny speaker; existing technology hasn't changed that. But to my non-audiophile ears, the sound is more than acceptable and into "very good" territory. (My previous go-to earphones were the SmartOmi Boots mini wireless earbuds, which are in-ear and thus provide better bass.) Michael deAgonia From left to right, a SmartOmi Boots mini wireless earbud, an AirPod and the standard Apple EarPods. Despite the ease with which the AirPods slip on, it takes a lot of effort to knock them out. In my use -- which has involved running, weight-lifting, a couple of bouts of Insanity classes, and, just to see if I could knock them out, sustained head-banging -- the only time they fell out of my ears was when they were physically knocked out. (Other people have reported less luck keeping them in place, though; your mileage may vary.) Using them There are a couple of ways to interact with the AirPods, but because they lack buttons, actions are limited. Inserting one or both AirPods will sound a chime, alerting you that they're connected and ready. While audio is playing, removing one will pause the audio -- perfect if someone walks up to chat. Placing the AirPod back in your ear automatically resumes whatever you were listening to beforehand. If you remove both AirPods and then put them back in your ear, you have to manually trigger the audio to re-start. Double-tapping either AirPods brings up Siri or Play/Pause your audio source, depending on your setting. (Settings can be changed in the Bluetooth category in iPhone Settings.) And...that's it. To do anything else, you use Siri, which responds to commands for adjusting volume, skipping tracks, starting playlists, and other Siri-related functions like getting the weather, placing phone calls and dictating messages. The built-in microphones pick up audio really well (using what Apple calls a voice accelerometer in concert with the beamforming mics). At work -- in a quiet cube farm environment -- I invoked Siri but didn't want to disturb coworkers with audible commands. To my surprise, the AirPods were able to pick up commands I whispered. Using your voice to control basic functions works well enough; but Siri still needs enhanced capabilities to make the experience better. For instance, using Siri means that there needs to be an active internet connection, even for on-device functions like skipping tracks or volume adjustment. And Siri often displays the answer to a question on the iPhone screen instead of reading it out loud. So in that sense, Siri is a letdown. Support for local functions without an internet connection would be a good improvement. So would adding configurable multiple-tap options per AirPod. (In addition to the two taps that initiate Siri, there could be options for three taps on the right AirPod to skip, and three taps on the left to go back a track, etc. Thankfully, that's an option that could be added later via software update if Apple so chooses. Let's hope they do.) Keeping them charged The quality and build seem solid. When they're slid into the charging case, the AirPods snap into place via hidden magnets. The case also closes with a satisfying snap, and is held shut by magnets. That means there's no latch to catch on something or break, or button to depress to open the lid. And because it uses a decent magnet, you can be confident the case won't just open and cause you to accidentally lose an AirPod. (It costs $69 each to replace them if you do.) Michael deAgonia The AirPods carrying case doubles as a charger Just putting the pods in the case for storage means they're getting charged. Fifteen minutes of charging buys three hours of audio; on full charge, the AirPods should last for five hours. The case, which is charged with the included Lightning cable, has about 24 hours of battery capacity. In my experience, I've had to charge the case about once a week, while using the AirPods during the work day and for gym sessions. If you want to check the battery status of the AirPods and the carrying case, you can do so in the Control Center on your iPhone under the AirPods option, or when you flip open the carrying case near the unlocked iPhone. (The AirPods need to be in the case though.) Final thoughts Michael deAgonia Some people think the AirPods look goofy in use. I don't. The AirPods aren't without issues. I have had several dropped connections, and each time it was embarrassing. In a couple of weeks of daily testing, there were a few times the connection completely dropped and my iPhone speaker broadcast to my coworkers that I was listening to sports radio (Go Patriots!). It's annoying having to scramble for the audio pause button, so I'm hoping Apple will improve the connection behavior in the future. I've also noticed audio cutouts at times, when the sound drops out for a second or so. Interestingly, I've seen more hiccups with macOS than iOS 10. And I should note that a few people have told me they look goofy, in case that matters. But I don't care. Ultimately, the AirPods do much more right than wrong. If you're already in the Apple ecosystem, these AirPods (or even the newest Beats headphones with the W1 chipset) will work very well across all of your devices; if you're not in the Apple ecosystem, these little earphones are still worth checking out. Apple hasn't completely ended wireless audio issues with AirPods, but it's done a damned good job in a few specific areas (like initial setup and audio quality) to make the AirPods worthy of consideration if you're in the market for wireless headphones.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Apple cuts Tim Cook's pay 15% for missing sales goals by Matt Egan   @mattmegan5 January 6, 2017: 10:27 AM ET Tim Cook's Apple: 5 years in Apple's sales slump is taking a bite out of Tim Cook's paycheck. The iPhone maker cut Cook's pay by 15% last year to $8.7 million, according to a filing released on Friday. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) specifically cited the company's failure to meet its performance goals for both sales and profits. Shrinking iPhone sales last year caused Apple to suffer its first annual revenue decline in 15 years. Now Apple's board is holding its CEO and other leaders accountable for the stumbles. While Cook's salary rose to $3 million from $2 million last year, his cash bonus took a hit. Apple awarded Cook and other executives 89.5% of their target, instead of the maximum amount like in recent years. That meant Cook's cash bonus fell to $5.4 million in 2016, down from $8 million the year before. All told, Cook's total compensation was $8.7 million last year, compared with $10.3 million in 2015. Related: Apple is setting up shop in Samsung territory But don't feel too bad for Cook, whose real fortune is linked to his vast holdings of Apple stock. Last year, Cook completed five years as CEO and nearly 1.3 million of his previously restricted Apple shares vested. The shares were worth about $136 million. As in previous years, Cook's 2016 pay was below that of his top lieutenants. All five senior executives below him, whose salary is made public, made just under $23 million in 2016. That includes Luca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, as well as retail boss Angela Ahrendts. Apple's rare sales slump is directly linked to the loss of momentum for the iPhone, which generates the majority of the tech icon's sales. Sales of iPhones have declined in each of the past three quarters, slipping to 45.5 million in the September quarter. The problem is that Apple has faced steep competition from Samsung and other smartphone makes and the newest iPhones haven't featured enough upgrades to lure customers. Apple's stock ended 2016 with a healthy gain of 10%. That compares with a 13% gain for the Dow and 9.5% for the S&P 500. The popular stock received a boost in early September thanks to the Galaxy Note 7 disaster, which forced Samsung to discontinue the phone. Apple will reveal just how much it benefited from Samsung's pain when the company reports quarterly numbers on January 31.

Discover and enjoy new interpretations of traditional Chinese New Year Nianhua folk art. Using Apple products with various apps, five young Chinese artists reinvent classic motifs to deliver new year blessings with a contemporary twist. Lucky Rooster In Lucky Rooster, illustrator Victo Ngai imaginatively interprets the Chinese belief that when you are happy, good luck will follow. She used Apple Pencil in the Procreate app on iPad Pro to sketch, then moved to MacBook Pro to compose and color the design. In the finished work, a stylized rooster sings and dances with children to usher in a lucky new year. ● Mac ● iPhone ● iPad Joyful Reunions Eszter Chen’s Joyful Reunions unconventionally depicts a modern day Chinese New Year Eve dinner. Working directly on iMac with Adobe Photoshop, Eszter created fun characters with a childlike quality in her signature style of detailed block-print patterns and bright colors. This playful work expresses the simple wish that every family reunion be joyful. ● Mac ● iPhone ● iPad Rich Harvest The fantasy feel of Zhou Fan’s Rich Harvest was inspired by early memories: red lanterns, the sound of firecrackers, colorful festivities. Zhou hand-painted the detailed images first. He then multiplied and overlapped them using Adobe Photoshop on MacBook Pro to create a surreal image of a plentiful harvest that captures the spirit of bountiful blessings. ● Mac ● iPhone ● iPad Peaceful Home Traditional Nianhua that Ye Hongxing saw as a child inspired Peaceful Home, a surprising work that combines a conventional new year motif with contemporary objects. After creating the initial image using Adobe Photoshop on MacBook Pro, she then worked directly on the canvas, adding a variety of colorful stickers. For Ye, these everyday details create a feeling of serenity and belonging. ● Mac ● iPhone ● iPad Fortune Flows Familiar new year fish images are given a bold makeover in Jiang Shan’s Fortune Flows. After jotting down initial ideas on MacBook Pro, he drafted them up on paper, colored and enhanced them in Adobe Photoshop, then used Adobe Illustrator for a final touch up. In the finished work, a seasonal symbol of blessing surges and pulses with modern energy. ● Mac ● iPhone ● iPad Read More Follow iClarified Comments (3) Add Comment Obamasucks - January 9, 2017 at 12:39pm It's going to be the year of the "Cock".

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: The Dow came within one point of 20,000 for the first time on Friday and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 reached record highs, boosted by Apple, extending a two-month rally fueled by optimism about U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Apple climbed 1.1 percent after Canada's Competition Bureau did not find sufficient evidence the iPhone maker had engaged in anti-competitive conduct, closing a two-year investigation into the company. Wall Street has been on a tear since Trump won the U.S. election in November, with the Dow up 9 percent as investors bet he will stimulate the economy with lower taxes and infrastructure spending. While Friday's gains suggested the rally was not yet over, some investors have grown cautious. "The market's advance is understandable because of the economic stimulus optimism associated with a new Trump presidency," said CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall. "But parabolic market advances traditionally experience digestion of these gains, and I don't think this time will be any different." The record trading session followed a U.S. Labor Department report that showed the economy added fewer-than-expected jobs last month but wages increased, suggesting resilience in the labor market. Stocks did not react significantly to a report that five people were dead in a shooting at Florida's Fort Lauderdale airport. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 64.51 points, or 0.32 percent, to end at 19,963.8 points. The index rose as high as 19,999.63 but lost ground. Goldman Sachs rose 1.48 percent, helping the Dow more than any other stock. The S&P 500 gained 7.98 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,276.98, its highest close ever. The Nasdaq Composite added 33.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,521.06, also a record. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors rose, led by the technology sector's 0.96 percent gain. For the week, the Dow rose 1 percent while the S&P gained 1.7 percent and the Nasdaq jumped 2.6 percent. INVESTORS EYE EARNINGS The strength of fourth-quarter earnings reports from U.S. companies over the next few weeks will be closely watched by investors eyeing high stock valuations. Following its recent gains, the S&P 500 is trading at about 17 times expected earnings, pricey compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Analysts on average expect fourth-quarter earnings to rise 6.1 percent compared to a year before, when slumping oil prices crippled energy companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. During the session, Amgen rose 2.48 percent after a U.S. district judge blocked Sanofi and Regeneron from selling their cholesterol drug, which Amgen said infringed its patents. Regeneron fell 5.84 percent and was the biggest percentage loser on the S&P 500. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.11-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.21-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 24 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 76 new highs and 15 new lows. About 6.4 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, a bit under the 6.7 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Neighbors! It’s hard to believe Apple doesn’t already have a retail store in South Korea, but Koreans have been getting by with two certified Apple reseller stores up until now. Apple’s website now shows 14 new retail job listings in South Korea, including store leader and Genius bar staff. “We’re now hiring the team that will offer our customers in Seoul the service, education and entertainment that is loved by Apple customers around the world,” Apple told Reuters in a statement on Friday. The new brick-and-mortar store is said to be opening in the ritzy Gangnam district. South Korea’s Yonhap News reports that construction for a 6,000-square-foot building with two underground floors and one above ground floor has started in the Garosu-gil shopping district and should be completed around the end of November.

Bobbi Rebell reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Apple is venturing into Samsung's territory. The iPhone maker is planning to open its first retail store in South Korea, home to its smartphone archrival. Apple listed 15 jobs on its website, including openings for a store leader and business manager. It confirmed the plans for its new store in a statement, but declined to comment on exact location or the opening date. Max Wolff of 55 Capital: (SOUNDBITE) MAX WOLFF, MARKET STRATEGIST, 55 CAPITAL, (ENGLISH) SAYING: "Apple is opening a store at the backyard of their largest rival, which is a national champion in South Korea, and a big contributor to GDP and the national pride. And it also is a little bit of a tense moment becasue we've seen recent trouble in a flagship, large format phone from Samsung, the Note 7, which had a fire problem, was recalled and had another fire problem, so it's a store moment." South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported construction for the new Apple store is underway in a southern part of Seoul, and that the work will likely be completed by end-November.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Yashaswini Swamynathan Jan 6th 2017 1:01PM Jan 6 (Reuters) - The Dow came within a hair's breadth of hitting 20,000 for the first time ever on Friday as Wall Street staged a swift recovery, helped by technology stocks. A rise in Apple pushed the three major indexes to record highs. SEE ALSO: Apple App Store subscription revenue hit $2.7B in 2016, up 74% Apple's shares rose 1.1 percent to $117.86 after Canada's Competition Bureau said it did not find sufficient evidence iPhone maker had engaged in anti-competitive conduct, closing a two-year investigation into the company. The Nasdaq is on track to be the biggest gainer in Wall Street's first trading week of the year, rising about 2.6 percent. The S&P was set to gain 1.8 percent and the Dow 1.1 percent. The first record high of the year for the S&P 500 follows a U.S. Labor Department report that showed the economy added fewer-than-expected jobs last month but wages increased, suggesting resilience in the labor market. At 12:36 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 97.41 points, or 0.49 percent, at 19,996.7. The index rose to as much as 19,999.63. FindTheCompany | Graphiq The S&P 500 was up 12.55 points, or 0.55 percent, at 2,281.55. The Nasdaq Composite index was up 44.27 points, or 0.81 percent, at 5,532.21, easing slightly from an all-time high of 5,526.38. Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, led by the technology sector's 1.06 percent gain. Amgen rose 3.3 percent, after a U.S. district judge blocked Sanofi and Regeneron from selling their cholesterol drug, which Amgen said infringed its patents. Regeneron was off 7 percent and was the biggest percentage loser on the S&P. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,673 to 1,081. On the Nasdaq, 1,435 issues fell and 1,140 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 11 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 37 new highs and eight new lows.

Not investing​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ The biggest mistake investors and savers make is not doing it. Don’t wait for that raise, inheritance or lottery win. Start today, right now, with whatever you can. Consider this: If you can save just $5 a day, every day, for 30 years and earn 10 percent on it, you’ll end up with $343,693. That’s enough to change your life and the lives of those you love. And if you can’t find $5, start tracking your expenses and see where you can cut. We partner with PowerWallet, a free service that lets you set goals and automatically tells you where your money’s going. If you’re not using it or something similar, start. Photo credit: Getty 2. Investing before doing your homework When it comes to investing in risk assets like stocks, one mistake I’ve made is going on “gut instinct” and 20 minutes of internet research. In college I decided to start investing as a way to build my retirement. Good plan. But I also decided to invest in companies I knew and liked, rather than actually understanding them. Bad plan. When dealing with investments that can go south, don’t invest without a clue. If you’re thinking about stocks, there’s plenty of online research and information available there for free, not to mention TV shows and library books. There’s no reason to be uninformed. Photo credit: Getty 3. Being impatient In a post called “The 10 Commandments of Wealth and Happiness,” Money Talks News founder Stacy Johnson offer this advice: Live like you’re going to die tomorrow, but invest like you’re going to live forever. He also offers an example of how patience pays: The biggest winner in my IRA is Apple. I don’t remember exactly when I bought it, but I’m guessing it was in 2002 or 2003. My split adjusted price is around $8/share: Today Apple’s trading at around $400/share, so my $1,600 investment is now north of $80,000. Had I been impatient and sold early, I would have missed out on the most profitable investment I ever made. Stare at a newly planted tree for 24 hours, and you’ll be convinced it’s not growing. Fixate on your investments the same way, and you could miss out on a game-changer. Photo credit: Getty 4. Not diversifying There are two types of risk in stocks. The first is called market risk: If the entire market tanks, your stocks probably will as well. The other is called company risk, the risk that a specific company will do poorly. It’s hard to eliminate market risk, but you can reduce company risk by investing in lots of companies. For an example of diversification in action, just look at Stacy Johnson’s online stock portfolio. You’ll note the values of some stocks have more than doubled since he bought them, while others are worth less than he paid. That’s why you diversify. Can’t afford to own a meaningful number of companies’ stocks? That’s what mutual funds are for. A mutual fund allows you to own a slice of dozens — even hundreds — of companies with an investment of as little as $50. Photo credit: Getty 5. Taking too much risk  Everybody wants to double their money overnight. But if you’re always swinging for the fence, you’re going to strike out often. Some investments are little more than gambling. Investments like options and commodities, for example, promise huge rewards, but the risk is also huge: Read “Thinking Stock Options? Think Again.” There’s nothing wrong with the occasional flyer, but if that’s all you’re going to do, you’re not investing, you’re gambling. Go to Vegas; at least you’ll get free drinks. Photo credit: Getty 6. Not taking enough risk On the other side of the same coin, some investors stand like a deer in the headlights, unwilling to take even a measured amount of risk. Instead, they keep their savings in insured bank accounts, earning less than 1 percent and comforting themselves with Mark Twain’s expression: “I’m more concerned with the return of my money than the return on my money.” Insured savings will ensure you never lose anything. But they’ll also ensure that the purchasing power of your savings won’t keep pace with inflation. In other words, you’ll become poorer over time. Photo credit: Getty 7. Getting greedy  The first time I made money on a stock, I was hooked. I went overnight from stable, thoughtful investor to wild speculator. Thankfully, my father stepped in and convinced me to stop sprinting and start walking again. If he hadn’t, I probably would have blown my entire savings. Photo credit: Getty 8. Paying too much attention There is such a thing as information overload. Between the Internet, newspapers, magazines, and cable TV, it’s easy to get more than your fill of conflicting information. Step back, look at the big picture, find a few financial journalists or others you trust, then tune out the rest. “If I listened to all the experts on CNBC, there’s no way I’d still own Apple today,” says Stacy. “I buy quality companies and hold onto them for long periods of time. I can go weeks — even months — without checking them.” Photo credit: Getty 9. Following the herd One of the world’s wealthiest men, Warren Buffet, said, “Be fearful when others are greedy; be greedy when others are fearful.” Most of the stocks Stacy owns in his online portfolio were purchased when the Dow was below 7,000 and nobody was buying. His logic? “If you’re convinced the economy is going to zero, buy guns and canned goods. But if you can reasonably expect a recovery someday, invest — even if that day is a long way away, and even if it’s possible things could get worse before they get better.” Photo credit: Getty 10. Holding on when you should be letting go Stocks are best played as a long game. You should hold on long enough to see it through, but not knowing when to get out could cost you big. In 1980, General Motors was the largest company in the world. In 2009 it went bankrupt. Don’t obsess over your investments, but don’t ignore them either. Photo credit: Getty 11. Being overconfident The economy runs in cycles of boom and bust – when times are good, people often confuse luck with skill. This is what happened during the housing bubble and the dot.com stock bubble that preceded it. Being in the right place at the right time isn’t the same as being smart. Photo credit: Getty 12. Failing to adjust How you invest should change as your life changes. When you’re young, it makes sense to invest aggressively, because you have time to recoup from mistakes. As you approach retirement age, you should reduce your risk. The Great Recession and stock market decline of 2007-2009 wiped out the savings of many on the verge of retirement. That shouldn’t have happened, because they shouldn’t have had that much exposure to stocks. Check out “A Simple Way to Invest Your Retirement Savings” for tips on how to adjust your investments over time. Photo credit: Getty 13. Not seeking qualified help While investing isn’t rocket science, if you don’t have the time or temperament, consider getting help. The wrong help? A commissioned salesperson more interested in his financial success than yours. The right help? A fee-based planner with the right blend of education, knowledge, credentials and experience.

The news of Cook's pay cut comes from a report from the Wall Street Journal, which spotted the change in compensation in a regulatory filing from Apple.  Cook will lose out on about $1.5 million, dropping his annual salary from $10.28 million in 2015 to $8.75 million in 2016. The 15 percent cut was the steepest issued by Apple, Though other executives were also affected. On average, the higher ups at the company saw a 9.6 percent year-on-year reduction in compensation. In the regulatory filing filed on Friday, Apple revealed it missed its targeted goals for both its revenue and operating income in 2016. It also failed to reach its stretch goals, the first time the company has failed to surpass the goals since 2009. According to Apple, its annual sales of $215.6 billion fell 3.7 percent below its target of $223.6 billion. The company's operating income came out to $60 billion, falling 0.5 percent short of its targeted $60.3 billion. As a result of falling short, company executives got 89.5 percentage of their targeted annual cash incentives. Related Stories Apple Will Invest $1 Billion In SoftBank's Tech Fund Apple May Not Get Tax Concessions In India Apple struggled to maintain the astronomical sales figures it had previously achieved, seeing movement of its iPhone slide in 2016. The decline from historic highs resulted in the company’s first annual revenue decline since 2001 when it reported earnings in October. Despite its struggles, Apple is expected to report impressive sales figures when it reports its first quarter earnings in 2017 thanks to its strong holiday sales and the popularity of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. For Cook, the loss of money likely won't mean much. Apple's CEO voluntarily chose to receive the majority of his compensation in stock, and he netted $100 million in stock bonuses for serving five years as the head of the company. He liquidated a large chunk of his shares in Apple stock in 2016, netting him approximately $65 million, and continues to hold more than a million shares of the company. Cook announced in 2015 that he plans to give away most of his wealth over the course of his lifetime. Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

This could become reality because the pop megastar took on a role usually assumed by investigative journalists: She decided to “follow the money.” So when she discovered Apple was prepared to give away her songs for free (no royalties) in a promotion for its streaming service, Swift told Apple, “I don’t ask for free iPhones, so why free music?” Apple backed down after Swift wrote an open letter to its CEO Tim Cook, and not only paid for her music offering during the promotion period, but the tunes of every other artist. Related The Bart & Fleming Podcast Episode #9: New Year, New Beginning Swift’s rebellion may pay dividends long term by pointing up this broader question: Why is it that, while vastly more creative content is being consumed worldwide, less revenue is flowing to the people who create it? This is the issue probed by Jonathan Taplin in an important new book that demonstrates how intellectual property has been hijacked by what he calls the new “marketing monoculture” led by Facebook, Amazon and Google. Taplin even puts a number on it: He estimates that some $50 billion a year has been quietly shifting from content creators to “owners of the monopoly platforms.” Little, Brown Taplin’s book, from Little, Brown, is titled Move Fast And Break Things: How Google, Facebook And Amazon Cornered Culture And Undermined Democracy. Its message seems timelier following the recent techno love-fest between the web giants and President-elect Donald Trump. Taplin’s own career has spanned the creative spectrum, starting as a roadie for Bob Dylan; he then moved into film production, then academia where he directed the Annenberg Innovation Laboratory at USC. I have known Taplin for years and have found him to be a smart and thoughtful student of the cultural landscape. Having examined it from different perspectives he became infuriated by its anomalies. Why, he asks, have creative people, and the companies who control content, tolerated a level of piracy that has impoverished everyone except the kleptocrats who distribute content? One reason: We’ve all been distracted by the wrong issues. Objections have been raised to the proposed merger of Time Warner and AT&T, for example; yet the combined $300 billion market cap of these companies is about half that of Alphabet, the parent of Google. According to Taplin, every pirated music video or song on YouTube or Facebook “robs the creators of income,” given that YouTube is dominated by unlicensed content. YouTube presides over a 55% market share of streaming audio. To be sure, this phenomenon is especially rampant in the news business where revenues from advertising have been all but obliterated as Facebook (among others) has sucked up a giant share of digital advertising revenue. But the dangers, Taplin argues, go beyond the flow of money to the flow of news, real or fake. “We have ceded much of our freedom to choose by giving networks like Google and Facebook control of our (news) menu,” Taplin points out AP Few of us “outsiders” understand exactly how the news menu is determined by the black box algorithms, which significantly shape the course of our digital lives and beliefs. According to Jim Rutenberg, writing in the New York Times, the election of Trump might potentially present an opportunity for news organizations to challenge this. “Buying a subscription is tantamount to supporting the pillars of democracy” — that’s the new post-election sales pitch from magazines ranging from Vanity Fair to the New Yorker to The Atlantic, he reports. The home page banner of Vanity Fair heralds that it is “the magazine Donald Trump doesn’t want you to read.” Conde Nast claims a record 42,000 new signups by last Sunday. What can creatives do about these phenomena? Taplin for one is launching a series of Artist Rights Forums, visiting creative communities nationwide which he feels are “in denial.” He firmly believes artists can be mobilized to support legislation and other initiatives to restore a degree of equity in the distribution of artistic income. In short, more people should follow the money, like Taylor Swift did. “Taylor Swift won her battle with Apple last year,” Taplin said, “but only a very few artists have the muscle to set the terms of their deal.” Subscribe to Deadline Breaking News Alerts and keep your inbox happy 12 12 Comments Cancel reply Comments On Deadline Hollywood are monitored.

Millennial filmmaker • on Jan 6, 2017 9:28 am The older generation has ignored the cries for help from young artists. We don’t get VHS or DVD residuals or royalties. We don’t get to control the distribution of our products. The unions stay silent and the old media is too busy selling themselves off to China. Depressing how the older generation eats it’s children. Reply Anonymous • on Jan 6, 2017 11:18 am Fair enough, but at the same time, maybe you need to stand up for yourself and not give it away for free-create your own distribution and platforms, say no to big content… Reply Millennial filmmaker • on Jan 7, 2017 10:12 pm What do you expect us to do, put our work on VHS? Reply Film people • on Jan 6, 2017 9:35 am In addition to music, YouTube is filled with pirated movies and TV shows. They could stop them if they wanted, but they don’t, because their business is clicks. It’s really disgusting and hypocritical. Reply Nerdrage • on Jan 6, 2017 9:39 am Exactly what I have been saying for a while. Content is not king, distribution is, or will be. Content production is exploding while distribution is telescoping because customers want breadth of access, not multiple subscriptions. They go right for the biggest option. More and more content will be competing for mindshare in constricted pipes. Reply Stanford Crane • on Jan 6, 2017 10:05 am My view from Palo Alto is that Taplin has tapped into an area that the intellectually dishonest Silicon Valley doesn’t want to talk about, so I wrote a script called Vultures in the Valley which tells the real story. I showed it to two venture capitalists. One called it “disturbingly real” and the other called it “brilliant”. I hope it’s both, but it will probably never see the screen because of that. Most people have no idea how messed up the culture is. BTW, I am the founder of the Silicon Valley Incubator. Reply Anonymous • on Jan 6, 2017 10:54 am Peter Bart hates me, & I guess I’ll never be prez of his fan club, but hooray & for his piece about how content creators are being royally ripped off by monster monoliths of the New Age ( & Jonathan Taplin’s new book on that topic). “News” of course is now just more content, lumped with hillbilly tunes & slasher flix, yet it is still the vital lube of a democracy. Attention MUST be paid & I know that Mr Bart will be paying lots of it in weeks & months ahead. I look forward to it, if not to much else in the media maelstrom.

That is, your damn dumb computer. Reply Robert Benjamin • on Jan 11, 2017 8:08 pm A timely article, a few of us have been working on hacking the system of limited ownership which led these online distribution monopolies growing massively off the back of “free” user generated contributions. We’re creating what are called Balanced Ownership Platform Cooperatives where the users (creators, audience, etc) own the platform. Its just the beginning but it will bring the economic value of creation back into the hands of creators/artists where it belongs. Check out what Members Media Cooperative is doing. Reply J. S. Greenfield • on Jan 13, 2017 9:45 am I sure hope there’s more substance to the book than there is to this summary, for the above amounts to little more than name-calling and an assertion that Google, Facebook and Amazon *must* be doing something wrong, because they’re making a lot of money.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Patent Troll GPNE continues to Fight Apple in China over Infringing Patents related to Cellular technologies | Main | Huawei Begins their Big Squeeze on Samsung in the U.S. Today » January 06, 2017 Canadian Competition Bureau Closes its Investigation into Apple Conducting Anti-Competitive Practices   The Competition Bureau announced today that it is closing its investigation into concerns of anti‑competitive conduct by Apple related to its contracts with Canadian wireless carriers that sell and market iPhones.   The Bureau examined whether the contracts harm competition by impacting wireless carriers' incentives to promote iPhones over other brands of smartphones, and whether they resulted in an increase in the price of handsets or wireless services.   However, the Bureau did not find sufficient evidence to conclude that Apple has engaged in an abuse of dominance under the Competition Act.   In their formal statement, the Commissioner of Competition (Commissioner) announced in-part that he has discontinued an inquiry against Apple Inc. and Apple Canada Inc under the abuse of dominance provision of the Competition Act. The conduct at issue involved certain restrictions and obligations imposed on wireless carriers for the sale and marketing of iPhones to consumers in Canada   After conducting analyses of the information gathered over the course of the investigation, the Bureau has concluded that it does not have sufficient evidence to suggest Apple is contravening the Act in respect of the Apple Terms at this time. Specifically, the Bureau did not find evidence to suggest that the Apple Terms resulted in a significant effect on competition. The existing evidence suggests that the Apple Terms do not prevent wireless carriers and other OEMs from adopting strategies that serve to mitigate any potential effects of the Apple Terms.   The Commissioner makes his enforcement decisions based on the available evidence. Should new and compelling evidence come to light of harm in the Canadian marketplace, the Bureau will not hesitate to take appropriate action.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The research firm told DigiTimes that Apple may continue to procure MacBook Pro displays based on current amorphous silicon (a-Si) material until the end of the first quarter. The report claims Samsung and Sharp will begin supplying IGZO panels to Apple as soon as mid-2017. Sharp began mass production of IGZO displays in 2012, but evidence points towards Apple only using the material in iPads so far. A rumor claiming the first IGZO MacBooks would launch by 2014 proved to be inaccurate. IGZO is a semiconducting material that has forty times more electron mobility than the standard a-Si used as the active layer of an LCD screen, allowing for less power consumption, improved touch sensitivity, and increased pixel density, which could pave the way for higher resolution displays. DisplayMate president Raymond Soneira told us IGZO can also result in "significantly higher brightness," but the material costs "considerably more" to manufacture. Production and yield issues have slowed the adoption of IGZO, but the material is now showing up in more products such as LG's new OLED TVs. "Sometimes IGZO is simply referred to as Metal Oxide," he added. "The higher the PPI and the wider the Color Gamut (like DCI-P3 for the new MacBook Pro) the greater the benefits of IGZO over a-Si, particularly for LCDs." The glass edge and backplane circuitry of IGZO displays can also be made smaller, possibly leading to a thinner MacBook Pro. However, such a design change is less likely this year given Apple just redesigned the notebook in 2016 for the first time in four years. Apple's interest likely lies in the power savings. The original iPad Air's overall size and battery were reduced by around 25% compared to the previous model, and analysis suggested the tablet's new IGZO display made that possible. However, a smaller MacBook Pro battery would likely be perceived negatively following battery life complaints on 2016 models. Given the timeline, Apple's switch to IGZO displays may be planned for the next-generation MacBook Pro. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said new MacBook Pro models will launch in the second half of 2017, possibly with slightly faster Kaby Lake processors unveiled this week. IHS estimates Apple will order 9.7 million MacBook Pro display panels in 2017, an increase from 8.8 million units in 2016.

If they care so much about battery life, make a little thicker for more battery capacity or more ports. But they will relegate the MacBook Pro to the thinnest and sexiest dongle hub. Rating: 15 Votes Naraxus 1 week ago A thinner MacBook Pro.... One of many reasons why Cook just got $1.5 mil pay cut. He just doesn't get it. The pro community doesn't want a device that is paper thin. They don't want a gimmicky touch bar. They don't want to wait around for 4 years for some supposedly "Pro" desktop that doesn't even remotely come close to being a pro machine. They want power, they want all the ports they need, they want expandability & they want the pro software to go with them, nothing of which Apple's current Mac lineup provides and are some of the factors why Apple's pro customers are giving Apple the finger and saying "Adios". Rating: 13 Votes Jacbox9 1 week ago Based on all the rumored updates with new Kaby Lake Processors, IGZO Glass and who knows what else, I should return my 2016 MacBook Pro while I still can. No way dude, wait until 2018 since there will be an even better MacBook Pro. Actually scratch that, I hear 2019 is where it's at. Rating: 12 Votes ralphthemagi 1 week ago This, along with the new battery structure and better efficiency, will solve battery life issues but it probably won't be able to compete with the battery life of newer Windows notebooks. The battery life is really not that bad. And by not that bad, I mean it's actually pretty great considering the intensity of the display. The whining on these forums is pretty disastrous. I've been running off a 13" 2012 MacBook Air since… well, since 2012. It served me fantastically, but the display was getting a bit splotchy. I just bought a decked out 15" 2016 MBP. It takes a few days to settle. iCloud, Mail, Photos, Spotlight, Messages, iTunes, Time Machine… all this background **** running basically nonstop for days. After that, battery life is a good 8+ hours. The display is incredible. I don't even know what to do with it honestly, since my external display is crap by comparison now. Even the dongles… really not a big deal. I just need one—USB-C to USB-A for a hub. Everything else is a few dollars on Amazon for a new cables (USB-C to DisplayPort, USB-C to USB-MicroB, etc.). Carry an extra USB-C to USB-A adapter in the bag just incase. People make a big deal out of the silliest things. This "disaster" of a notebook is the best computer I've ever owned. If the battery goes to hell in a year I'll hand it in and get another one, NBD. That's the glory of AppleCare. Maybe I'll get the new display an an extra 30 minutes of battery life.

More efficient monitor + Kaby lake + better battery (hopefully) = a much better version of 2016's MacBook Pro. Now, if only we can get Apple to swallow their pride and bring back the SD card reader.

If the energy-based freemium system the game uses didn't grind your gears too much, you were rewarded with a really fun Trials game that had loads of depth and a neat multiplayer mode. The game is now available on the Apple TV, and what makes it more interesting than most typical Apple TV ports is this is yet another high profile game that Apple is heavily promoting with an Editor's Choice nod that requires an MFi controller to play. Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel Minecraft was the other big release to hit lately which Apple put their full promotional force behind that requires an MFi controller which really makes you wonder if Apple is ever going to sell some kind of Apple TV and MFi controller bundle that'd make the whole platform make a little more sense for gaming? Probably not, but if you're looking for an MFi controller, my favorite is still the SteelSeries Nimbus which you can grab for $50 over on Amazon. Trials Frontier by Ubisoft Free Watch Button Watch App Action Adventure Game 'Legend of Abhimanyu' Hits the App Store This Month Pre-Registration Is Now Online for the 'One Piece Thousand Storm' US Launch Eduardo Ribeiro Bueno Netto I've played so much of this game... its good! Installed again on my phone and doesn't work with MFi... Why they didn't put support for iPhone too, only ATV?! Strange... ptrostli Oh wow that's awesome! I loved the game (still do) but haven't played in a while. Hands down one of the best games on the App Store. For a freemium game I'm glad this made it to the Apple TV. It'll increase its popularity even more Ben Collins I love Trials on consoles, but this version is basically Trials with everything that's bad about mobile monetisation. Timers? Check. Random rewards? Check. Races you can't win without upgraded bikes? Check. It's all there.

MST January 06, 2017 Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks on stage during a product launch event on October 27, 2016 in Cupertino, California. Apple Inc. unveiled the latest iterations of its MacBook Pro line of laptops and TV app. (Photo by Stephen Lam/Getty Images) (Photo: Stephen Lam, 2016 Getty Images) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Apple CEO Tim Cook and other top executives saw their 2016 pay drop after the tech giant finished the year with lower revenue off weaker sales of its flagship iPhone. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Cook received $8.75 million in total compensation, which includes a $3 million base salary. In 2015, Cook earned more than $10 million. Other top execs including Eddy Cue, who runs Internet software and services at Apple, and retail chief Angela Ahrendts, also saw declines in compensation for 2016. The filing says execs received 89.5 percent of cash incentives for the year, during which Apple reported its first decline in annual sales since 2001. Operating income also sunk from $71.2 billion in 2015 to $60 billion last year. Shares of Apple are up nearly 1% in Friday trading. For 2016, Apple shares climbed 11 percent. The dip in revenue is tied to sales of the iPhone, down from previous years. During the fourth quarter, Apple sold 45.5 million iPhones, a 5% drop from the same time last year. Meanwhile, a report from Nikkei Asian Review says Apple will cut production of the iPhone during its 2017 first quarter. This year could provide the iPhone and Apple with a sales rebound. It marks the 10th anniversary of the device, and rumors suggest Apple has big plans for the next iPhone, which should launch in the fall. Follow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.

The meeting, which is open to all shareholders of record on a first-come basis, will take place at Apple’s Infinite Loop headquarters in Cupertino. Nine proposals will be up for shareholder vote, including the election of the company’s board of directors. All eight current directors — Art Levinson, James Bell, Al Gore, Bob Iger, Andrea Jung, Ron Sugar, Susan Wagner, and Tim Cook — are expected to be re-elected to their posts. As is typical, there are several investor-driven proposals which the company’s board recommends shareholders vote down. These include a proposal that the company issue annual reports on how and why it selects recipients of its charitable giving, a previously-defeated proposal that the company officially increase diversity in its board of directors and senior management, a proposal to engage outside experts on reforming the company’s executive compensation practices, and the adoption of a new policy which would require Apple executives to retain 75 percent of their net stock awards until retirement. In most cases, Apple argues that its current policies already address shareholder concerns, and that the proposed changes would be unduly burdensome on the company. A Pay Cut for the Top Brass Also revealed in Apple’s SEC filing is the company’s executive compensation for 2016. Of note, Apple’s top executives all saw a pay cut due to the company’s performance-based incentive program. While Apple projects record-setting revenue for Q1 2017, 2016 overall was a relatively tough year for the company, one in which it saw its first year-over-year revenue decline since 2001. This resulted in a percentage-based reduction in compensation for Apple executives, dropping Mr. Cook’s pay from $10.28 million in 2015 to $8.75 million for 2016. Apple’s other senior executives — CFO Luca Maestri, retail chief Angela Ahrendts, services head Eddy Cue, hardware engineering chief Dan Riccio, and general counsel Bruce Sewell — all took home approximately $22.8 million each after earning about $25 million each last year.

MacPaw is immensely committed to the Apple community, and their commitment to sponsor our coverage is yet another sign of that. It takes a lot of work–and money–to get the team assembled here and back in the office to ensure plenty of qualtity, curated Apple-focused CES content, and having MacPaw on board to help us make sure that happens for you is truly special. Indeed, MacPaw’s Setapp shows a similar commitment to user-friendliness. Setapp is the Netflix of Mac software. With one monthly fee you get access to all the software available inside Setapp, no ads, no paid upgrades. Setapp has already lined up an impressive list of well-known Mac software for the service including Ulysses, RapidWeaver 7, Reveal, and Eltima Player and more. Setapp lets you subscribe to more than 50 Mac apps for a monthly fee Two of my personal favorite and most-regularly-used apps, iStat Menus and Screens, are included in Setapp, as well. This means you get access to these apps–and all their updates–as part of your Setapp subscription. You don’t have to worry about signing up and purchasing apps individually, and you don’t have to worry about apps expiring. Macpaw has put a lot of effort into making Setapp easy to use, and it shows. Upon initial installation, you get what looks like a folder of available apps. It’s only once you click on a specific app, though, that it’s actually downloaded to your computer and activated. You’re not forced to download or use anything you don’t want to, and your monthly subscription only lasts as long as you wish. The Setapp subscription service is currently in beta through the end of the month, and you can go now and sign up for free. After this month, you can either cancel or continue paying just $9.99 per month and the service will continue. Setapp keeps bringing on board more and more high-quality Mac apps, and I think you’re going to love what they’re doing. Visit Setapp.com today to sign up and give the service a trial run and find your favorites! If you are interested in sponsoring TMO, please email us and we’ll get you more details.

The consistent gain in employment has started to push wages higher. Average hourly wages increased 0.4% in December and 2.9% for the year. This marks the fastest increase since the recovery started in 2009. More people are entering the workforce as the labor-force participation rate ticked up to 62.7%. The increase in wages might prompt the Fed to further increase rates.   About the Author Manjul Bhusal Sharma is a data analyst for Morningstar. Contact Author | Meet other investing specialists After a rocky start Friday morning, U.S. stocks steadied, and both the Dow and S&P were up 0.26%. The Nasdaq had added 0.49% before noon. Gold was trading for $1,173.20 per ounce, down 0.69%. Crude-oil futures were down 0.35% to $53.56 per barrel. Stock on the Move  Apple's SEC filings showed that its annual sales were 3.7% below its target of $223.6 billion. The company's operating income of $60 billion was 0.5% shy of its target. So, the company cut CEO Tim Cook's 2016 pay. Other company executives received about 89.5% of their targeted annual incentives. To help its cause, the company is planning to open its first retail store in South Korea. Apple listed hiring notices for 15 positions on its website and is going to compete with Samsung on its rival's own turf. Currently, Apple has about 500 stores in more than 20 countries. Its online store is available in 39 countries. Foreign Markets Canada added a total of about 214,000 jobs in 2016, per Statistics Canada. The country gained 53,700 of these jobs in the last month of the year. Despite this positive surprise, the unemployment rate edged up to 6.9% because more people were looking for jobs.   Asian stocks were mostly down. The Nikkei 225 was down 0.34%, and the Sensex and Shanghai lost 0.44% and 0.35%, respectively. The Hang Seng Index, on the other hand, ticked up 0.21%. European markets were mostly higher. The Stoxx 600 was the only major index to slip. The DAX and CAC 40 gained 0.03% and 0.07%, respectively. The FTSE 100 was up 0.17%.

Image: Laura Hutton/Shutterstock Failure to meet annual sales targets in 2016 has led to Apple CEO Tim Cook taking a pay cut. Cook still earns more than most mortals, however, and received compensation of $8.7m for 2016. This is down from the $10m he received in 2015 and the $9.2m he was paid in 2014. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchanges Commission, top executives at Apple received only 89.5pc of their annual cash incentives. This is because the Cupertino tech giant failed to surpass its $223.6bn earnings from 2015, earning $215.6bn in 2016. In 2016, Cook received $5.3m from his incentive pay, compared to the $8m in 2015 and $6.7m he earned in 2014. Nevertheless, Cook’s base salary increased to $3m in 2016, up from $2m. The Apple business machines rumbles on 2016 was the first year that Apple’s flagship iPhone saw shipment declines. But even despite the declining numbers, Apple is still a tough act to follow, with a war chest of $237.6bn in cash and investments. This week, the company revealed that 1 January 2017 was the busiest day in the App Store’s history to date, with $240m in purchases made in those 24 hours.

File picture: Eric Risberg San Francisco - There's a quirky twist on tourism emerging amid the Silicon Valley whirlwind of innovation that has tethered everyone to their smartphones. Those omnipresent devices are being used to track down technological touchstones scattered around the San Francisco Bay area so selfies can be taken, videos can be recorded and the experience can be celebrated in a Facebook post, Snapchat or tweet. Here's a tourist's guide to nerd nirvana for those more interested in seeing the suburban home where The Woz built the first Apple computer alongside Steve Jobs than the spooky prison in the Bay where the Birdman of Alcatraz once served time alongside Machine Gun Kelly. Growing up in a garage Silicon Valley startups have a history of humble beginnings, dating to 1939 when Hewlett-Packard was founded in a Palo Alto, California, garage. It still stands at 367 Addison Ave., considered by many to be the birthplace of Silicon Valley. HP now owns the place. Jobs was one of many entrepreneurs influenced by the HP legacy as a teenager, eventually inspiring him and his engineering friend, Steve “The Woz” Wozniak, to begin working on Apple's first computer in the home of Jobs' parents. That ranch-style house at 2066 Crist Drive in Los Altos, California, is now owned by Jobs' sister, Patricia. After they started Google in 1998, co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin built what would become the world's dominant search engine in a garage and room they rented from Susan Wojcicki, whom they later hired (she now runs YouTube for them). The Menlo Park, California, house, at 232 Santa Margarita Ave., is now owned by Google. Shortly after starting Facebook in his Harvard dorm room in 2004, Mark Zuckerberg and a few friends moved to Silicon Valley for what they thought would be just one summer. Zuckerberg never returned to Harvard, and the world hasn't been quite the same since then. The Palo Alto, California house where Zuckerberg did a lot of computer coding and threw some wild parties, if you believe the movies, is located at 819 La Jennifer Way. The place is still rented out by young entrepreneurs hoping some of Zuckerberg's magic will rub off on them. Tech temples The headquarters of Apple, Google and Facebook have turned into must-see shrines to products that have become part of culture's lifeblood. None of the companies offers public tours, but that doesn't mean you can't steal glimpses at these factories of innovation. Search starts here Google is the most accessible of the three headquarters. The hub of its Mountain View, California, campus is at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, with other Google offices sprawling almost all the way down to the nearby NASA Ames Research Center, where Page and Brin keep personal jets in a hangar. Walk down Charleston Road and you are bound to see one of the company's employees (also known as “Googlers”) cruising on yellow, green, blue and red bikes placed outside all the offices to get to meetings more quickly. While strolling around, make sure to swing into the office at 1981 Landings Drive, where you can take a selfie with Android statues memorialising different versions of the operating system that powers most of the world's smartphones. Each statue represents a dessert because Google has nicknamed each version after something sweet. The menu includes Cupcake, Donut, Eclair, Froyo, Gingerbread, Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich, Jelly Bean, KitKat, Lollipop and Marshmallow. The latest serving of Android, called Nougat, has just started rolling out. Finally, in the Google store on the main campus, you can buy company-branded merchandise, including shirts, hats, mugs, pens and even notebooks (the kind with paper). A place everyone likes The giant thumbs-up sign replicating Facebook's symbol for liking a post has become one of the most photographed spots in Silicon Valley since the social networking company moved its headquarters from Palo Alto to 1 Hacker Way in nearby Menlo Park five years ago. Unless you happen to be in a plane or have a camera-equipped drone, you won't be able to see what's on top of another Facebook building across the street (an underground tunnel connects the offices). That building, designed by famed architect Frank Gehry, features a nine-acre park atop the roof. One more thing Apple, founded in 1976, has had a fiercely loyal following for decades, so its Cupertino, California, headquarters has long drawn tourists looking to get a picture of its famous logo and the 1 Infinite Loop sign denoting its address. There is, of course, an Apple store at the headquarters, where people can buy company-branded merchandise not sold in most of its other stores. But you can't get help fixing your iPhone, iPad or Mac here. You'll have to go to another store for an appointment at the Genius Bar that serves as Apple's customer-help desk. The current headquarters will be overshadowed next year when Apple plans to open a nearby 2.8 million-square-foot, circular office that has been likened to a huge spaceship sitting on a 176-acre site. Known as “Campus 2”, the new building is designed to accommodate about 12 000 workers. Before Jobs died in 2011, he stipulated that the campus should be surrounded by about 7 000 trees. TV show The HBO comedy Silicon Valley has won many accolades over three seasons, so fans may want to see the house that serves as headquarters for the fictional startup, Pied Piper. The location has been given as 5230 Newell Road in Palo Alto on the series, but that address doesn't exist. The house is actually is in southern California, at 5230 Penfield Avenue in Woodland Hills. So put it on the sightseeing list for your next visit to Hollywood.

The Wall Street Journal points to a regulatory filing, which says the miss kept the leaders from hitting some cash incentives. Apple said its annual sales were $215.6B, 3.7% below its target of $223.6B, and its operating income of $60B was 0.5% short of their $60.3B target. As a result, Cook received $8.75 million in 2016 compensation, down from $10.3 million in 2015. Cook’s 15% drop is significantly higher than other Apple executives, which saw an average of a 9.6% decline in pay, as cash incentives make up a larger portion of his compensation. CFO Luca Maestri’s pay fell 10% to $22.8 million ($20 million in stock). This is the first time in Tim Cook’s tenure Apple has failed to hit its maximum revenue target for the year. All eyes will be on the company later this month, as it reveals  earnings for its fiscal Q1. The last holiday quarter is the last time it saw YoY growth.

It is great that Apple is trying to lead the trend with their improvements on products (such as introducing USB-C) but they also need to listen to the consumers and give them what they want/need, such as keeping the normal USB 3.0 ports. Same as giving people more stable systems. Look at how many buggy updates we get with iOS now? It used to be much more stable but now they fix some and introduce even more bugs! Some bugs should have never ever gone past the beta stage, especially now you have all these public testers too. Apple is still doing great but there’s only so much you can continue to milk out of the things Steve Jobs had left. n0ahcruz3 Well thats what they get for releasing a boring product as well as being “courageous” we dont want to buy lots of dongles Tim Crook!

Sorry you don’t like your job earning 50 times what I make in a year. Kevin Paterson It’s called business news. It has implications beyond Cook’s bank account. techfreak23 Good. If the company isn’t doing great, no one should be getting any kind of bonuses or “cash incentives,” including the top brass. Mr_Coldharbour As Jim Dalrymple already said, no need to shed a tear, what these executives make in a year, “disappointing” performance or otherwise, is more than we’ll ever see in a lifetime. Just saying. Anonymouse I feel bad they missed out on tneir bonuses, so I’d like to do a whip arpund and everyone can donate.

The first day of the Chinese New Year is January 28, 2017. The artists include Victo Ngai, Eszter Chen, Zhou Fan, Ye Hongxing, and Jiang Shan. Apple has given some background information on each piece of art created for the Chinese New Year celebrations, which were all created using a range of its products, including the MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, Apple Pencil, and iMac. Software programs used to make the art include Procreate for iPad, and Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator for Mac. On its website, Apple has wallpaper download links for each piece of art, as well as the date and location where each artist's work will be showcased at an Apple retail store in China. Earlier this week, accessory maker Mophie also announced a product of its own that has a theme surrounding the Year of the Rooster. Available on Apple.com, users can purchase a version of Mophie's Powerstation Plus XL mobile battery with all-new artwork designed by Chinese street artist Hua Tunan. The XL universal battery offers 12,000 mAh of charge to both iOS and micro USB devices. Apple has offered exclusive wallpapers to users in the past, last March encouraging fans to use its Renew program with a set of pro-environment backgrounds. For the Chinese New Year images, users can choose to download each piece of art in sizes for the Mac, iPhone, and iPad. Earlier this week, Apple announced a Chinese New Year sale where users had the chance to get a free pair of red Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones when they purchased a select Mac or iPhone. The sale is now over, but began at 8:00 AM local time on January 6 in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. The company also launched a New Year's gift guide with products themed around the celebrations. Tag: Chinese New Year 29 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) Johnny907 1 week ago Interesting.

Is there a reason Tim is sucking up this hard to the Chinese, or is that just the thing to do these days? ... did you just compare this to Black Friday, the universal day for all retailers in the US to clear out old stock while padding their numbers for the busy holiday season, like Apple was doing us some kind of favor giving out gift cards with old tech while other retailers were offering direct discounts worth twice as much? Yeah, ok Rating: 2 Votes Brookzy 1 week ago As with the environmental wallpapers, it really does leave me scratching my head as to why they aren't in 5K. o_O Rating: 2 Votes Lone Deranger 1 week ago Lovely work.

Apple has reportedly signaled it wants to open retail stores in India, but has not agreed to the Indian government's stipulations on sourcing 30 percent of products locally as the country tries to boost manufacturing, the report said. India also has reportedly refused Apple's request to import and sell its refurbished smartphones locally. Samsung's Q4 profit Samsung expects its Q4 operating profit will spike 50 percent from the same time last year to reach its highest levels in three years, based on strong chip and improved smartphone sales, Reuters reports. The company is projecting overall revenue for the period will fall about 0.6 percent to $44.5 billion from the corresponding period last year. Samsung said it expects Q4 operating profit of $7.8 billion, well ahead of analysts' projections, Reuters notes. Despite Samsung's Note 7 disaster, the company's mobile division has reportedly bounced back based on solid sales of its Galaxy S7 smartphones. The company plans to disclose more detailed figures for the quarter by the end of this month. Meanwhile, Samsung intends to produce 10 million Galaxy S8 smartphones, according to a report in South Korea's Electronic Times. The company will start making the new models in March with an expected April release, the report said. Cyber attacks' spike Ramped up cyber attacks, new regulations and a shift in how businesses approach cyber risk management will alter the security landscape in 2017, according to a new report by risk management firm Stroz Friedberg. In its 2017 Cybersecurity Predictions report, the company outlined the top security threats as nation state cyber espionage, a rise in data integrity attacks and an increase in attacks harnessing Internet of Things devices. ZTE's layoffs Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE is cutting about 3,000 jobs, or five percent of its global workforce of 60,000 workers, Reuters reports. The job cuts include about 600 jobs, or 10 percent of the mobile operation's total workforce, with most of the terminations in China, the report said. Tech industry's bright outlook Seventy-six percent of technology workers or investors believe the tech industry's best days are still to come, with 59 percent certain the incoming Trump administration will be favorable to the industry, according to a new Burson-Marsteller report. The survey, entitled Age of Trump Technology Policy, also measured responses from the general public and what it called "technology elites". About 59 percent of the general public believe the tech industry's fortunes will improve in the next four years, and 50 percent contend Trump's policies will help IT companies, the report said.

We don't know just how many devices Google has shifted, but the reviews have been largely positive, and the move seems to have been a success. Now Google has made a clean break, it's in brand new territory - so what will it do with the Pixel 2 in 2017? The story so far The very first Pixel has only been with us since October 2016, but the way Google handled the Nexus range of phones might give us some clues about what the future holds. From the Nexus One to the Nexus 6P, the flagship stock Android handsets were released in January 2010, December 2010, October 2011, November 2012, October 2013, November 2014 and September 2015, with the Pixel and Pixel XL then appearing in October 2016. There's obviously a pattern there of an autumn release and it would be a surprise if the Pixels didn't follow that - even more of a surprise considering the likes of Apple, Samsung and Google's other rivals are locked into yearly release cycles at this stage. The Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 are likely to be with us in October 2017 then, and Google may well stick with HTC as its uncredited hardware partner - that is if it still needs a hardware partner this time around. If Google is relying less on someone else to make the phone, and bringing more of the hardware process in house, it may be able to launch the Pixel 2 even sooner. How many Pixels will there be? We've now used to Apple launching a smaller and a larger handset every September, and it makes sense to cater to as wide a group of people as possible, with two different screen sizes and two different starting price points every year. That was probably Google's thinking last October and there's no real reason why it would deviate from it in 2017. Both Pixels are pretty much identical, except for the screen size, screen resolution and battery capacity - unlike the iPhones, there's no variation in the camera configuration. Of course Apple has the iPhone SE as a third option - but that kind of nostalgic blast from the past is unlikely to be an option Google's going to take anytime soon. In fact we don't think there's going to be a third phone of any size, and we'd be very surprised if Google didn't stick to the Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 in October. Don't forget Google already has a Pixel C tablet, which may well get an update of its own at some point during 2017, so it has the larger screen covered. Google Pixel 2: rumours and speculation It's been quiet on the Pixel 2 rumour front so far - very quiet - so we can only assume Google runs a tight ship as far as smartphone leaks go. News of the original Pixel did trickle out a few months ahead of time, but there wasn't quite the same level of speculation as we're used to for the Apple iPhone. There is one rumour of note worth mentioning that concerns the last Pixel: that HTC replaced Huawei as Google's hardware partner late in the day, just nine months before the phone was due to be released. If Google has a longer run up this time around then we can expect a handset that's even more polished and desirable - perhaps we'll get those optional extras like waterproofing and wireless charging that were missing from the 2016 Pixel phones. No doubt we'll start to hear more about what the Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 have in store for us as the year progresses, but don't hold your breath for anything revolutionary - as Google Assistant shows, the biggest innovations may well be on the software side. Google Pixel 2: what we're expecting The Snapdragon 835 already looks set to be the go-to mobile CPU of choice during 2017, and it's a good bet that it's going to find its way into Google's Pixel phones too, bringing better performance alongside less drain on the battery. Elsewhere there are likely to be minor improvements: the 4GB of RAM might get bumped to 6GB, and the smaller phone might get an upgrade to the 2,560 x 1,440 QHD resolution sported by the larger one, though it makes less of a difference on a 5-inch screen. Much was made of the camera on board the Pixel and Pixel XL last year, and Google will probably want to focus on this again in 2017 - there might even be room for a dual-lens approach, to follow Apple's lead, and perhaps optical image stabilisation too. Don't forget the virtual reality angle either. There might not be a new Daydream View headset in 2017, but the new Pixels will definitely be built to be compatible with it, and any spec bumps will be made with VR in mind.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

The interface was uncomplicated, the click wheel made navigating through the UI a breeze, and it only improved further as the design progressed through further generations of the product. But while the simplicity of that interface was well suited to the relatively basic functions of the device, applying the same UI paradigms to a slightly more complex device - like a phone - probably wouldn't have been the right approach. Even so, Apple experimented in doing exactly that, developing a version of its iPod interface for early prototypes of the iPhone. Noted blogger Sonny Dickson published a video and a series of photos showing that operating system in action - and as he pointed out, "Apple clearly made the right choice" when it decided to ditch those efforts and focus on developing the iPhone OS that eventually became what we know today as iOS. Sonny got his hands on one of Apple's earliest iPhone prototypes, which featured an aluminum chassis, 2G and WiFi connectivity, and a multi-touch display. However, the operating system was quite unlike iOS as we now know it, and much closer to the iPod user experience, with a virtual on-screen scroll wheel in the lower half of the display used to interact with iPod-style menus in the upper half, with the two portions separated by additional navigation controls. The absurdity of this approach is best exemplified in screens like the phone dialer, in which users would still have to use the scroll wheel to select and input numbers, rather than simply tapping the number on the display as you would expect to be able to do on a touchscreen. One can only imagine the usability nightmare of writing multiple text messages in the same way. As Sonny points out, the interface was known internally as 'AcornOS', but it's not clear if Apple ever intended to use that branding publicly. Apple went as far as patenting the idea for this UI approach of menus controlled by an on-screen navigation controller, but thankfully, it eventually abandoned work on AcornOS, in favor of basing the development of the iPhone OS on its OS X desktop operating system. You can see AcornOS in action in the video below: And if you want some idea of what might have happened if Apple had really run with the idea of extending the click wheel across all of its products, The Onion is here to help: Source and images: Sonny Dickson Tags Apple Iphone Iphone os Acornos Ios Ipod Like Tweet Share Share Report a problem with article Previous Story Microsoft formally shuts down its TechRewards program Next Story Microsoft fires back at media outlets claiming the demise of the Command Prompt Advertisement Community Activity Refresh Anyone Know What This Device Is? in General Discussion [DKIM] Subdomain Mail Server in Internet, Network & Security Nintendo might have a solution for migrating previous purchases to the Switch in Front Page News Cat-Skinning: SMS and MMS apps that can avoid using mobile data in Android To upgrade or not upgrade... in Hardware Hangout Acer's Liquid Jade Primo Windows phone disappears from the US Microsoft Store in Front Page News How to backup data & OS when swapping HDD with SSD in Hardware Hangout Xiaomi won't release sales figures anymore in Front Page News Trending Stories This Weekend's PC Game Deals - There's a fix for every gamer in the current winter sale 11 hours ago with 5 comments Here's the complete list of all confirmed games for the Nintendo Switch Jan 14, 2017 with 17 comments Philippine government blocks Pornhub and other adult websites Jan 14, 2017 with 42 comments Xiaomi won't release sales figures anymore Jan 14, 2017 with 4 comments Related Stories Video shows off rudimentary version of iOS Apple developed for the original iPhone Jan 11, 2017 Almost four months after its release, iOS 10 is now on 76% of active iOS devices Jan 6, 2017 Kantar: Windows phone market share falls further; iPhone 7 sales give iOS share a boost Dec 7, 2016 Simply watching a specific video can crash any iPhone in minutes Nov 22, 2016 · Hot! deals VPN Unlimited: Lifetime Subscription $499.99 $29.99 94% off Pay What You Want: White Hat Hacker 2017 Bundle $1,271.00 $1.00 100% off VPNSecure: Lifetime Subscription $450.00 $39.00 91% off Scrivener for Windows $40.00 $20.00 50% off Oracle Database 12c Administration Training Bundle $2,065.00 $49.00 98% off Show Comments 6 Comments - Add comment Sort by oldest first (thread view) Sort by newest first (thread view) Sort by oldest first (linear view) Sort by newest first (linear view) Advertisement Report Comment Close Please enter your reason for reporting this comment.

(Reuters) Super Mario Run is among last year's top 10 most downloaded apps worldwide, with Pokémon Go taking the top spot. Apple on Friday announced that its app developers earned over $20 billion in 2016 - up over 40 per cent from 2015 - stating that New Year's Day was the highest single day ever for the App Store with nearly $240 million in purchases. Since the App Store launched in 2008, developers have earned over $60 billion, creating amazing app experiences for App Store customers across iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV and Mac, Cupertino-headquartered tech giant said in a Press release. "We want to thank our entire developer community for the many innovative apps they have created - which together with our products - help to truly enrich people's lives," Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice-president of Worldwide Marketing, said in a statement. Customers broke all-time records this holiday season with purchases from the App Store topping $3 billion in December. In the same month, Nintendo's Super Mario Run made history with more than 40 million downloads in just four days after its release, and was the most downloaded app globally on Christmas Day and New Year's Day. Super Mario Run is also among last year's top 10 most downloaded apps worldwide, with Pokémon Go taking the top spot. Pokémon Go, a beloved game from Niantic, quickly became a cultural phenomenon in mid-2016. Prisma, Reigns, Procreate, Lumino City, Sweat With Kayla and djay Pro, from some of Apple's independent developers, were among the most successful apps for iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Apple Watch and Mac, respectively. The App Store offers 2.2 million apps in total, up over 20 per cent from last year. With the App Store available in 155 countries, Apple's customers have access to millions of apps to make their lives easier, enrich their passions and connect with people from all around the world. The App Store's top-grossing markets include the US, China, Japan and the UK, with China experiencing record year-over-year growth at an incredible 90 per cent. The global impact of the App Store was captured this past year with two campaigns - Apps for Earth and Games for (RED). In partnership with the World Wildlife Fund and (RED), customers were empowered to make a difference, helping to protect life on our planet and join the fight against AIDS. The custom content created by each campaign's participating developers helped raise over $17 million in total for the two organisations. With the introduction of iMessage apps and SiriKit in iOS 10, developers created exciting new types of app experiences. iPhone and iPad customers now have access to over 21,000 iMessage apps to send stickers and easily collaborate with friends, and for the first time ever, users can ask Siri to book rides, make payments, return a call and more. Since subscriptions became available across all 25 app categories this fall, including Games and Kids, customers can subscribe to their favorite services from over 20,000 apps, with Netflix, HBO Now, Line, Tinder and MLB.com At Bat among last year's most popular. iPhone and iPad customers grew the App Store's subscription billings significantly in 2016, to $2.7 billion, up 74 percent from 2015. Apple revolutionised personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple's four software platforms - iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS - provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. Apple's more than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it. IANS adds: According to an Apple India spokesperson, app developers from India are now creating amazing apps for its platform. "There are several app developers from India who are now part of the growing innovative community globally," the spokesperson said. Apple last year revealed plans for an iOS app design and development facility in Bengaluru. Across India, Apple supports over 640,000 iOS app developer jobs and other positions related to the iOS ecosystem. Apple is also reportedly setting up its first manufacturing smartphone plant in Bengaluru this year. - with input from IANS - business@khaleejtimes.com Share More > Vote ERROR: Macro /ads/dfp-ads is missing!

The iPhone 8 could make fans even ANGRIER than Apple’s last and most controversial gadget Rumours swirling that tenth anniversary iPhone will feature a VERY surprising design feature by MARGI MURPHY 6th January 2017, 5:03 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments APPLE’s iPhone 8 won’t come with a Lightning port OR a jack for earphones, it has been claimed. The news is sure to infuriate Apple fans who are already smarting from Apple’s decision to get rid of the headphone socket in the iPhone 7. 4 The tenth anniversary of the iPhone should herald in something huge Removing the lightning jack would effectively make iPhone owners’ accessories totally useless. All manner of gizmos use this connector, from high end speaker systems to hard drives and converters which allow iPhone owners to plug cameras or other devices into their iPhone. Instead of a cable, the tenth anniversary iPhone 8 will use wireless charging to juice up the batteries, Steve Rizzone, the chief executive of wireless charging company Energous strongly hinted. Rizzone has insinuated that his company will be providing the technology for Apple’s next smartphone. Apple reveal the new intelligent wireless Airpods that intuitively connect Getty Images 4 Apple's new 'airpod' headphones, which feature wireless audio transmission and a teeny-tiny rechargeable battery eBAY 4 Apple Airpods were being flogged for more than £399 on eBay after they sold out across the world Reuters 4 Airpods are Apple's wireless headphones, which do not need to be plugged in He revealed that his firm has signed a "key strategic partnership" with "one of the largest consumer electronic companies in the world" in an interview with Verge. Rizzone added: "I cannot tell you who it is, but I can virtual guarantee that you have products from this company on your person, sitting on your desk, or at home." If true, the move will infuriate Apple owners who have bought pricey plug adaptors to charge up their iPhone or a variety of other expensive accessories which feature lightning connectors. Customers have already forked out a whopping £159 for a pair of AirPods because other earphones won't work with the latest iPhone 7 - although our own reviewer LOVED Apple's wireless headphones and many tech fans feel the same.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « We weep to learn that Super Millionaire Tim Cook won't make as many Millions as last year | Main | Canadian Competition Bureau Closes its Investigation into Apple Conducting Anti-Competitive Practices » January 06, 2017 Patent Troll GPNE continues to Fight Apple in China over Infringing Patents related to Cellular technologies   In August IPWatchdog reported that the Federal Circuit affirmed Apple iPhone patent victory over GPNE. The patents at issue related to a two-way paging system, where the paging devices are capable of not only receiving messages but also sending messages back in response. While Apple had quickly emphasized GPNE's status as a "patent troll" post-trial, it wasn't allowed to use that term during the trial. A few months before the trial began, Koh issued a ruling making clear that Apple wouldn't be allowed to call GPNE a "troll" at trial, which got some attention.   While the case noted above may have ended for the time being, there's been another ongoing patent case in China between GPNE and Apple. The case reportedly began in 2013.   According to yesterday's report by the Shanghai financial newspaper the "National Business Daily," during the past four years, Apple has asked the State Intellectual Property Office of China to reexamine the patents to invalidate them. In September 23, 2014, Apple litigated administrative appeal to the Beijing First Intermediate People's Court. However, the patents are still valid as all the litigation requests from Apple have been rejected.   As of the end of last November, the Shenzhen Intermediate People's Court has held hearings three times regarding the case. So far, Apple has made no comment on the allegations.   According to the publication, the lawsuit accuses 'computerized communications devices and computerized tablet devices' known as iPhone and iPad manufactured by Apple infringe on patents owned by GPNE and claims indemnity of 900 million yuan (about US$129 million), the highest number of this kind of compensation in the country.   Huang Jingyu, or Gabriel Wong, founder and inventor of the Hawaii-based company told the newspaper that the patent relates to general packet radio service.   As part of the 3G standard for GSM radio frequencies, it allows features such as multimedia messaging, push-to-talk over cellular, always-on Internet access and point-to-point networking.   Huang said the patent has received patent protection rights in 14 countries, including China, USA and Japan.   Before accusing Apple, the company consecutively sued Motorola, Cisco, BlackBerry, Samsung, LG, Sony Ericsson, Sharp, HTC and Huawei in regard to the so called patterns infringements.   Compared to the dispute with Apple, most of the companies have either reached accommodations or signed patent permission agreements.   In the end the report failed to inform us of any firm trial date, though the story coming to light at this time would suggest the time is nearing.   About Comments: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit comments.

Cook earned $8.75 million in total compensation last year, including a $3 million base salary, according to a Friday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That’s well short of 2015, when Cook earned more than $10 million. Other top Apple execs including Eddie Cue, who runs internet software and services, and Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s retail chief, also got pay cuts, according to the filing. Still, while top Apple execs’ pay fell an average of nearly 10 percent, Cook’s fell by a full 15 percent, feeling the brunt of a slew of disappointments that have plagued the company this year. In addition to the iPhone 7’ s lack of a a headphone jack, critics have blasted the new MacBook Pro for its short battery life and only semi-useful “touch bar” above the keyboard. SEE ALSO Tim Cook's terrible year in review :0 For Tim Cook, 2016 is a year that can’t end... Tim Cook's terrible year in review Elsewhere, the Apple Watch has failed to gain traction, and the company botched the holiday release of its new wireless “AirPod” headphones, which only became available after Christmas for most customers. Apple’s full-year sales of $215.6 billion were 3.7 percent below its target of $223.6 billion, and its operating income of $60 billion was 0.5 percent short of the $60.3 billion target. As a result, company execs got only 89.5 percent of their targeted annual cash incentive, versus 100 percent a year earlier. The revenue dip was sparked by declining sales of the iPhone. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Apple sold 45.5 million iPhones, down 5 percent from a year earlier. Recently, a report from Japanese news agency Nikkei said Apple will slash production of the iPhone in the current quarter by 10 percent. Looking ahead, analysts are hopeful that Apple has big plans for the 10th anniversary of the iPhone with the release of a new model that’s significantly different from the past three which have only seen minor differences.

View all partners Republish this article Republish our articles for free, online or in print, under Creative Commons licence. Sami Keinänen/Flickr, CC BY-SA Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Ten years ago, anyone who wanted the latest and best smartphone was excited about the Nokia N95. Launched at the Nokia Open Studio in September 2006, it was trumpeted as the all-in-one multimedia computer and went on to achieve sales of a million handsets within the UK in its first year. On paper, it had everything a gadget-lover could desire, including a 2.6-inch LCD screen, a 5-megapixel camera with Carl Zeiss optics and video recorder, up to 8GB of storage, 3G and WiFi connectivity, and a built-in GPS receiver with navigation software. The N95 showed the world’s number one mobile phone manufacturer, Nokia, at the top of its game. Yet, as we now know, all of that was about to change dramatically when, on Jan 9 2007, Steve Jobs announced that Apple was entering the mobile phone business with the launch of the iPhone. At a technical level, the iPhone was significantly inferior to the N95. To start with, it was a 2G device not a 3G one. Its camera was only 2 megapixels and it didn’t support GPS. Yet, what it did offer was a totally new concept in smartphone design. Until Apple’s entry into the mobile world, handsets had been designed by companies who viewed the device as a phone first and a computer second. That’s not too surprising given its history and evolution, starting out as a basic telephone and slowly but surely acquiring more computing features. But a new entrant can turn thinking on its head, and that’s precisely what Apple did by viewing the handset as primarily a computer that just happened to include a phone capability. Nokia N95. Asim18/Wikimedia, CC BY-SA This was clearly reflected in its appearance, where the physical keyboard was eliminated and replaced by a single button and large touch screen. In contrast, the Nokia N95 had a range of buttons and a slide feature that revealed a conventional phone keypad. Even more important were the key differences between the software that controlled the two phones. Nokia was locked into the cumbersome Symbian operating system and its complex user interface, whereas Apple iOS was centred on the touch screen with gesture controls and had a fully functioning web browser and, of course, apps. Several reviewers at the time were rather lukewarm towards the iPhone, concerned about its technical inadequacies and especially its lack of 3G. But Time magazine still named it Invention of the Year for 2007. Disruptive technology The Apple iphone is a classic example of disruptive technology. It arrived from seemingly nowhere, it turned thinking on its head and it demonstrated how design can triumph over raw technology. Whatever you happen to think of Apple as a company –- it seemingly has as many detractors as evangelist supporters -– there is no question that it revolutionised smartphone design. If you look at smartphones leading up to 2006, they all share similarities in style, appearance and features with the Nokia N95. Whereas, post Apple’s launch, smartphones started to emulate the iPhone and its sleek, black simplicity. As for Nokia, the iPhone effectively killed the company. It first clung on to its Symbian operating system while Apple forged ahead and then switched to Microsoft when the rest of the industry moved to Android. In 2011, Apple took Nokia’s number one slot for smartphone sales. After this, the company’s fall was dramatic and the mobile industry’s focus moved away from Europe. Today’s smartphone sales are dominated by Samsung, followed by Apple and then Chinese firm Huawei, but with Android as the most popular operating system. That said, you’ll struggle to find a smartphone today that doesn’t share several similarities in appearance with the iPhone. Not bad for an “inferior” bit of technology.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive UPDATE: Apple Valley man arrested on suspicion of murder after death of 8-year-old son Friday Jan 6, 2017 at 8:41 AM Jan 7, 2017 at 12:02 AM Jose Quintero Staff Writer @dd_jquintero Paola Baker Staff Writer @DP_PaolaBaker APPLE VALLEY — A 38-year-old man was behind bars on suspicion of murder after his 8-year-old son was found unresponsive inside their home in the 13000 block of Navajo Road, officials said. San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department officials said the investigation revealed Shakir Omari Nunn was responsible for Dominic Nunn’s death. Sheriff’s officials said Nunn was arrested early Friday morning at the Apple Valley Sheriff's Station. San Bernardino County Children and Family Services responded to take custody of the other children at the home. “Dominic’s mother was determined to be out of the area at the time of the incident and there is no evidence to suggest she was involved in the crime,” sheriff's officials said in a statement. Authorities responded to a report of an 8-year-old boy who was found not breathing inside the home Thursday evening. Deputies and paramedics arrived at the home, where they discovered Dominic unresponsive and performed CPR. Dominic was then transported to Desert Valley Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 7:28 a.m., despite lifesaving measures, authorities said. “Detectives from the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department, Specialized Investigations Division, Crimes Against Children and Homicide Details were summoned and are conducting the investigation,” sheriff’s officials said. The Daily Press spoke to several neighbors Friday about the incident, who mentioned the home was unusually quiet for a family with several children — but also attracted attention from law enforcement due to several strange incidents. Vince Morales, a neighbor who lives in an apartment complex directly across the street from the Nunn home, said he only ever saw the children once during their time there. “It was very quiet there,” Morales said. “I only ever saw them playing outside once. I did see (sheriff’s officials) out there every so often, but hardly ever saw anyone out there.” Another couple at the complex, who identified themselves only as David and Nadine, also reiterated the strange silence they observed from the home. “You don’t see movement in the house,” Nadine said. “They always had their blinds drawn and we never saw anyone in the backyard or kids outside playing or anything. A school bus stops behind our apartment but we never saw any kids walking to the bus from there.” Cornell Wallace, who lives at a home on Ottawa Road adjacent to the Nunn home, said he’s lived in the area for about six months. In that time, he’s observed sheriff’s units responding to the home “numerous times,” Wallace said. “The last time was on Halloween. Several (sheriff’s units) and fire trucks were there — much like last night,” Wallace said. “They are over there quite a bit.” Several other neighbors reiterated that statement, with some mentioning they heard what seemed like a child screaming on Halloween night, as well as other incidents involving Shakir Nunn. “We could hear the child screaming loudly from the bedroom inside my apartment," a neighbor who also lived at the apartment complex told the Daily Press who wished to remain anonymous. “Lots of (Sheriff’s officials) responded that night, but I don’t know what came out of it.” “One time [Shakir Nunn] came home and kicked the door in,” Nadine said. “He’s a pretty big guy. I’ve heard him yell at the kids a few times very sternly. He seemed to have sole custody of them, though. I never saw a woman there or the mother.” A search through county court records revealed that Shakir Nunn had filed a restraining order against the children’s mother, Alisha Johnson, in early August — two weeks after Johnson had filed a restraining order against Nunn. The restraining orders appeared to stem from a domestic violence incident in early July in which Johnson was arrested on suspicion of battery on a spouse or cohabitant. Court records also show Nunn had primary custody of the children following the incident. “I just feel for the children," Nadine said. "They were screaming and crying when (sheriff’s officials) removed them from the home last night.” Sheriff’s officials said no further information was available Friday on the investigation or previous incidents at the home. Shakir Omari Nunn was being held at High Desert Detention Center in Adelanto ineligible for bail, booking records show. He is expected to be arraigned in a Victorville courtroom Tuesday afternoon if criminally charged by prosecutors. The investigation is ongoing and anyone with information is asked to call Detective Scott Stafford or Sgt. Robert Warrick at 909-387-3589.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Apple cuts Tim Cook's pay 15% for missing sales goals by Matt Egan   @mattmegan5 January 6, 2017: 10:27 AM ET Tim Cook's Apple: 5 years in Apple's sales slump is taking a bite out of Tim Cook's paycheck. The iPhone maker cut Cook's pay by 15% last year to $8.7 million, according to a filing released on Friday. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) specifically cited the company's failure to meet its performance goals for both sales and profits. Shrinking iPhone sales last year caused Apple to suffer its first annual revenue decline in 15 years. Now Apple's board is holding its CEO and other leaders accountable for the stumbles. While Cook's salary rose to $3 million from $2 million last year, his cash bonus took a hit. Apple awarded Cook and other executives 89.5% of their target, instead of the maximum amount like in recent years. That meant Cook's cash bonus fell to $5.4 million in 2016, down from $8 million the year before. All told, Cook's total compensation was $8.7 million last year, compared with $10.3 million in 2015. Related: Apple is setting up shop in Samsung territory But don't feel too bad for Cook, whose real fortune is linked to his vast holdings of Apple stock. Last year, Cook completed five years as CEO and nearly 1.3 million of his previously restricted Apple shares vested. The shares were worth about $136 million. As in previous years, Cook's 2016 pay was below that of his top lieutenants. All five senior executives below him, whose salary is made public, made just under $23 million in 2016. That includes Luca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, as well as retail boss Angela Ahrendts. Apple's rare sales slump is directly linked to the loss of momentum for the iPhone, which generates the majority of the tech icon's sales. Sales of iPhones have declined in each of the past three quarters, slipping to 45.5 million in the September quarter. The problem is that Apple has faced steep competition from Samsung and other smartphone makes and the newest iPhones haven't featured enough upgrades to lure customers. Apple's stock ended 2016 with a healthy gain of 10%. That compares with a 13% gain for the Dow and 9.5% for the S&P 500. The popular stock received a boost in early September thanks to the Galaxy Note 7 disaster, which forced Samsung to discontinue the phone. Apple will reveal just how much it benefited from Samsung's pain when the company reports quarterly numbers on January 31.

But it appears that a new 'jet white' version could soon be hitting stores - if the Beats Instagram page is to believed. The headphone division posted a snap appearing to show a white version of the iPhone 7 next to its headphones, with the caption 'new moves, new places'. Scroll down for video  It appears that a new 'jet white' version could soon be hitting stores - if the Beats Instagram page is to believed. Late last year a video emerged online which hints at what the white version could look like, if Apple does release such a device.  However, some claim the image could just be a result of an Instagram filter - and it could actually be silver handset that has been 'washed out'.  Reports of a new white version first appeared in November, when Japanese site, Mac Otakara, suggested that Apple would add a sixth colour option to its iPhone 7 line-up. Sources speaking to the website said: 'Apple seems to have a plan to add a pure white model to iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus.' The website cited the source as a 'supplier'.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Mystery of the ghostly air raid sounds is SOLVED: Strange... Mark your calendars!

The post, by Sonny Dickson, a technology leaking site, says: 'Could this be the Jet White iPhone 7?' alongside a video showing an iPhone 7 and an iPhone 7 Plus, both with white casings. The iPhone 7 Plus features an Apple logo, but the iPhone 7 model does not, suggesting it could be a fake. Users on Twitter have noted that similar casing replacements can be found on various sites, such as Alibaba, suggesting the phones in the video may have third-party shells rather than official Apple designs. A video has emerged online which hints at what the white version of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus could look like, if Apple does release such a device For example, a firm called ColorWare, which specialises in personalised cases, replied to the tweet with a picture of a very similar shell, saying: 'Looks familiar:)'  Could this be the Jet White iPhone 7? pic.twitter.com/pHoDiZ63ON— Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) December 27, 2016 Users on Twitter have noted that similar casing replacements can be found on various sites. For example, a firm called ColorWare, which specialises in personalised cases, replied to the tweet with a picture of a very similar shell, saying: 'Looks familiar:)' Apple currently offers the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in jet black, black, gold, rose gold and silver, while the Apple Watch is already available in a ceramic white.   Apple launched the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus at a San Francisco event in September. The stakes for the iPhone 7 were high after sales of the gadget dropped during two straight quarters this year, the first declines in its history. An Apple information website based in Japan said the company might have plans to bring out a 'pure white' or 'jet white' version of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The website cited the source as a 'supplier'. Artist's impression of the white iPhone pictured Apple currently offers the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in jet black, black, gold, rose gold and silver The Apple Watch is already available in a ceramic white option, pictured The new phones feature improved cameras and eliminate the traditional headphone jack in favour of new technology.  Instead, users can plug into a Lighting port or can opt to use wireless 'AirPod' headphones that cost £159 in the UK and $159 in the US.  Reaction to the change was mixed, with many people taking to Twitter to mock the price of the AirPods and how easy they could be to lost. But others have praised the move - which Apple says took 'courage' - highlighting the importance of innovation to the iPhone's enduring popularity. The range of cases available for the iPhone 7 already comes with a white option (shown in the middle) WILL THE JET BLACK IPHONE SCRATCH? The glossy 'jet black' finish on the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus may be more prone to scratching than other colours, says Apple. The frank admission was spotted under the FAQ section on Apple's iPhone 7 web page. The disclaimer reads: 'The high-gloss finish of the jet black iPhone 7 is achieved through a precision nine-step anodisation and polishing process. 'Its surface is equally as hard as other anodised Apple products; however, its high shine may show fine micro-abrasions with use.  'If you are concerned about this, we suggest you use one of the many cases available to protect your iPhone'.  Read more: iPhone¿Pure White¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ | Rumor | Mac¿¿¿¿¿ blog¿¿¿¿¿ Sonny Dickson on Twitter: "Could this be the Jet White iPhone 7? https://t.co/pHoDiZ63ON" Share or comment on this article e-mail 20 shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany She's falling for him?

Play it now! more GADGET REVIEWS Is it really worth paying £280 for the Switch? MailOnline gives its verdict on Nintendo's latest console While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. A familiar old friend that could be the perfect starter phone: Dailymail.com's verdict on the iPhone SE The new iPhone SE has a 4inch screen and familiar design - but has had a huge upgrade on the inside, making this a perfect first time iPhone. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

The Competition Bureau filed a motion to open the investigation into Apple’s alleged agreements with Canadian carriers in December 2014, though began seeking records from carriers in June, 2015. Any anti-competitive agreements between the two parties would constitute a breach of the Competition Act. The investigation surrounded the claim that Apple had used its “dominance” in the market to reach agreements with Canadian carriers that limited their ability to discount the smartphones of competing manufacturers. In March, 2015, Apple submitted 46 thousand documents to the Federal Court of Canada, which subsequently asked carriers to release their iPhone sales records. In collecting these documents, the Bureau was searching for any contractual evidence through “anti-competitive”clauses that may have led Canadians to pay more for handsets or wireless services than would have otherwise been required. The carriers asked for insights on the investigation include Bell Mobility (Virgin Mobile), Rogers (Fido), Telus (Koodo Mobile), MTS, Eastlink, SaskTel, Tbaytel and Videotron.  At the time the motion was initially filed, the Competition Bureau spokesperson Gabrielle Tassé stated that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing on the part of Apple, though should any surface, the Bureau would not hesitate to act. “There is no conclusion of wrongdoing by Apple Canada Inc. at this time, and no application has been filed with the Competition Tribunal or any other court to seek remedies for any alleged anti-competitive conduct. Should evidence indicate that the Competition Act has been contravened, the Commission will not hesitate to take appropriate action,” said Tassé in 2015.  The Competition Bureau’s statement released today confirms the end of its investigation into the smartphone giant, having found no evidence of wrongdoing in the contracts they’d obtained from carriers. The investigation concluded that Apple had not violated the terms and conditions of the Competition Act.

This was a favourite conspiracy theory of Fandroids and others who seemed to think Apple was preventing rival business from competing when in fact iPhones just sold all that much better and its what people wanted which is why carriers may have favored the brand more. Mobility providers are in business to make money. Not to provide a platform for money losing entities that don’t cut it with consumers. Homer J. Simpson Well, Apple did fix ebook prices previously and you can’t just ignore that when you let them do business in your country. Shogun Others were included in that ebook matter as well if memory serves. This was a baseless inquiry but what’s done is done. Should serve as a guide going forward Homer J. Simpson Not sure what others involved have to do with anything but the point I was saying is you don’t just let someone with a criminal history into your home without being suspicious, even if they’re clean now. gommer strike Maybe all these held a lot more weight with the early days of iPhone(past the time they were an AT&T exclusive). There may have been a window of opportunity where the iPhone was the only game in town in terms of smartphone, and Android handsets hadn’t yet adopted a similar form factor. But these days with Android phones accounting for 90% of the worldwide market…it’s really hard to think that Apple’s abusing their dominance…uhhh what dominance now? It’s Me There was never a dominance in Canada. This was only ever an attempt by robellus to distract and redirect blame for the insane rates they charge. Nothing easier than saying “blame Apple” and it’s amazing people opened their mouths wide to swallow that load. ciderrules How many millions did they waste on this? Rev0lver It’s not a waste at all. It’s literally the mandate of the competition bureau to investigate potential anti-competitive activities. ciderrules Frivolous investigations are a waste. They should spend a little more time up front deciding if there’s merit before launching into a full investigation. Meanwhile they’re doing nothing about the much bigger problem of Telus, Rogers and Bell. How can they charge virtyally identical prices for plans and not be accused of price fixing is beyond me. Rev0lver I’m not sure it was frivolous but I agree that the big three Telecom companies should be a top priority. It’s Me They investigate when there is a complaint. They should have perhaps considered the source of the complaints in this case before wasting so much time and money. Rev0lver Who was the source of the complaint? It’s Me It was kept anonymous, but given the nature of the complaints, dealing with very specific private contractual issues, it’s pretty obvious. Unless it was Apple complaining about themselves it really could only be one or more of the big 3. Homer J. Simpson That doesn’t make sense at all… This complaint was about carriers not being able to discount other phones due to suspected agreements with Apple. The carriers shouldn’t have to “suspect” if they are the ones in agreement with Apple on this. They should have the evidence to provide this agreement since they are the agreeing party. So how can it be the big 3? This is more likely the phone manufacturers seeing low sale volumes from the carriers and wondering why carriers aren’t discounting their phones to get more sales and since Apple has had a past of price agreements, they’ll put the blame on Apple. It’s Me Except those competitors wouldn’t have access to Apple’s agreements with the carriers, which was the heart of the complaint. So, that doesn’t make any sense at all. Homer J. Simpson That’s the purpose of the complaint. If they had access to Apple’s agreements and the evidence to provide anti-competitive agreements, this would just be a straight up lawsuit and not a complaint. If carriers were the ones to complain, they’d be in hot waters themselves because they themselves are the agreeing party to an anti-competitive agreement. It’s Me Hahaha. Did you seriously write that? That’s just funny. No. A complaint is an accusation and requires facts. Otherwise we’d have lots more frivolous investigations like this. Without facts it’s libel. You should try lodging a few frivolous and fictitious claims without any evidence with a official government agency. See how that works out for you. You guys are honestly hilarious. I hope you are all putting on an act. Man I hope it’s all an act. Homer J. Simpson Okay, cut the personal attacks and let’s be serious here. Let’s assume it was one or more of the Big Three filed the complaint. Explain to me why they would do that? That’s like after you’re done dealing drugs, you go talk to cops and say that your dealer has been dealing drugs. How does that even make sense? It’s Me A) at the time there was a lot of interest in having the carriers explain why their rates had suddenly doubled or more. They’d tried blaming the 2 year terms but anyone with grade 3 math saw that didn’t fit. It was convenient to shift blame for their massive price hikes elsewhere. Point the finger at Apple and presto, look how many people jumped on and actually thought that made sense. B) my personal guess is that Apple received a lot of complaints about Canadian carriers imposing especially expensive plans on iPhone users. I would fully expect Apple to approach the carriers and say “um stop screwing our users with special high rate” given other flagships with similar subsidies were available for lower prices plans. The carriers might have then used that as an excuse to raise rates for all instead of correcting iPhone plans. If they were threatened by Apple that they’d lose they iPhone if they gouged iPhone users unfairly, then that might trigger a complaint against Apple and the carriers would even be able to show exchanges where Apple was pressuring them to have more balance in their pricing. Just my guess. However, a complaint like this requires evidence. Given the complaint was about carrier contracts, only Apple and the carriers would have access to that evidence. In any case, it was a baseless accusation. Homer J. Simpson “In 2014, the Bureau received information suggesting that Apple entered into agreements with Canadian wireless carriers that imposed potentially anti‑competitive obligations and restrictions regarding the sale and marketing of iPhones.” In either scenario, when carriers bring this to the competition bureau, they are pointing fingers at themselves whether or not they are trying to point fingers. That is literally the worse finger pointing excuse. It’s Me How are you making that leap? You’ll notice the word “imposed”, as in forced, as in they claimed Apple forced these terms on them. They were portraying themselves as victims. Homer J. Simpson If Apple forced these terms on them they could’ve brought these terms to court and not sign the terms, raise the prices of other handsets and then file the complaint after customers starts to complain about prices. At which point, they are co-conspirators. That sounds like a stupid thing to do. It’s Me Brought the terms to court? Um, not exactly. They’d bring a complaint to the relevant authorities, such as happened in this case. In a fantasy world where these complaints had any merit and Apple controlled the market, the carriers couldn’t just refuse and then take them to court. They’d lose the iPhone for the duration of the proceedings. No, in the real world, they’d play ball and file a complaint. Which is what the did in this case, except the complaint was without merit and appears to have had other purposes. Look at this thread. Look how well it worked. Not one person in the circIejerk has any thought on why carriers raises rates, the main point of the complaint in question, and are instead still focused on Apple, they party just cleared of any wrong doing. If someone wanted to come up with a plan to distract the simple from questioning high rates in Canada, they really couldn’t have done it any better. Homer J. Simpson If you have evidence you can take it to court. That is how the real world works. That is how you have ridiculous lawsuits. That is how you have lawsuits that have no grounds because even people with no grounds and facts attempt lawsuits. I don’t know what Canada you live in but there’s something wrong with the Canada you describe. Once you sign a contract, you acknowledge that you are aware of your actions and that you willfully commit to the actions of the contract. Also nowhere in the document does it say the carriers are victimized. The investigation is on whether Apple entered an anti-competitive agreement with carriers. It’s Me Actually, no, in the real world, you take them to the competition bureau. That’s why we have an competition bureau. That might lead to a court case, but if you are claiming anti-competitive behaviour, you take it to that authority…the competition bureau. Did you think they were given that name accidentally? Homer J. Simpson Yes, you’re right on that, if you have evidence, you can take it to the competition bureau but for legal services, not to file a complaint and have them investigate using the evidence you have only to find no evidence. It’s Me Any accusation is alleged until it is actually proven. That doesn’t mean you don’t require any evidence to make the accusation. Well, I suppose you don’t need any evidence, but without evidence, the accusation is simply libel. As for the carriers, it costs them nothing to file the complaint. And if the investigation did require some resources from them, it would be worth it. They get attention diverted from them, which clearly worked. And, as a side benefit, just the launch and publicity of the investigation might help to dissuade Apple from continuing to pressure them not to screw iPhone users on plans. With so many people willing to buy this BS, without any thought as usual, there could have been a chance that Apple would just back down and the carriers would be free to screw iPhone users, whom the carriers saw as their own little cash cow. Homer J. Simpson Seriously, you’re stretching your arguments thinner and thinner. It’s Me How so? Your premise is based on the CB launching major investigations without any basis in fact or evidence. That’s just not how things work. You want them to start an expensive investigation, you file a complaint with some evidence. Only by assuming no need for evidence can one get to your position of it being another OEM that started the investigation of contracts between Apple and the carriers…talk about stretching. Homer J. Simpson So what happened to this evidence submitted by the carriers? The bureau came up with nothing. What happened to it? You’re a carrier and you’re filing a complaint saying Apple is preventing you from discounting other prices/services. Why not just breach the contract, discount the other handsets, and have Apple lawyers come after you and then present that as evidence? Why spend two years investigating? I’m saying no evidence in, no evidence out. You’re saying some evidence in, no evidence out, even though that evidence magically came out of nowhere because as you said, they’re really trying to shift the blame to Apple for something else they’ve done. So what evidence? They forged it? It’s Me Why would they breach? Bell and Telus spent years begging to be allowed to sell the iPhone. Breaching wouldn’t result in Apple suing them, they’d just lose access to selling the iPhone. The value of the evidence would come down to how it was viewed. The evidence was likely their agreements and records of their discussions, especially the discussions after agreements were already in place. If Apple threatened to pull their iPhone if a carrier didn’t stop singling out iPhone users for special gouging, that might be enough to file a complaint. Get the right softheaded bureaucrat to listen and they might agree that Apple was pushing them around to get their way. If the carriers claimed, opposite to what Apple actually requested, that Apple’s request for fair treatment actually meant for the carriers to raise prices for all (especially since that’s exactly what the carriers did) then someone might actually believe that. Two outcomes, even with thin and misapplied evidence: apple either backs down (by choice or force) or the complaint goes nowhere but attention shifts to Apple for a while and off of the carriers behaviour. Seems to have worked out exactly as one would expect, because that’s exactly what happened (the latter). A lot of non-Apple users actually started blaming Apple for the high rates they pay. Sure, they might be the dimmer bulbs, but they still bought it and spread it, even right here with fellow commenters. Homer J. Simpson No, if I was the CB investigating, why dance around with evidence that ended up not being evidence. I would just advise the carrier to breach and Apple would present itself with threats indicative of anti-competition. Not spend two years inquiring Apple and other carriers letting them know you’re investigating them. It’s Me Because once an investigation is launched, they needed to get a full picture of the entire situation, hence the requests for gobs and gobs of records from Apple…thousands and thousands of documents. No one ever accuses the government of acting quickly. Why would the carriers breach? And what exactly would they be breaching? Breaching would do them no good. All it would mean is that carrier wouldn’t be selling iPhones, something they were desperate to keep doing. If their was no clause in the formal contracts about this specifically then there would be nothing to breach anyway. But the terms likely allowed for Apple to terminate the agreements or at the very least not to renew them. That would give Apple the leverage to make such a demand…and at that point, trying to get the CB for force them to retract the demand would the best outcome of a CB action, but not the only positive one. The value of distracting the masses from blaming them was priceless. Homer J. Simpson So all of a sudden Apple stops supplying iPhone to one or more of the three big carriers after breaching. The big 3 with the most customer base. That doesn’t sound suspicious at all. It’s Me They sold to Rogers only for years. What’s suspicious about it? Apple makes it very clear that selling iPhones privilege for a carrier not a right…that’s why they are able to negotiate very favourable terms with carriers. Seriously, what’s suspicious about it? It’s called business. If you have an in demand product or service, you have more leverage in your discussions. The carriers hate that (here and elsewhere). What better way to get Apple to bend than to get the gov on your side, especially when even if you lose, you still win elsewhere (distracting the dimwitted). Homer J. Simpson So instead of straightening out with the carrier on the down low, they would just do a high profile move and lose at least a third of the customers in Canada? Sure, that sounds like Apple. It’s Me Carriers beg to sell the iPhone, not the other way around. If carriers continued to single out iPhone users with higher rates, Apple would rightly expect to lose sales of iPhones. They probably wouldn’t want that. Let’s say bell lost the iPhone and Telus and Rogers got inline and stopped gouging iPhone users, that’s worst case if Apple had to act on their threat. iPhone users move from bell and end up with a better deal as well. Bell wouldn’t want that and they aren’t dim enough to think customers are more loyal to them than to their own wallets or Apple. Bell (or whichever carrier was the example) would lose much more than Apple. Not sure why that’s such a difficult concept for you. Have you never negotiated for anything? You seem to be having some difficulty with the concept. Using their leverage to get what they want…yeah, you’re right, that does sound like Apple. Homer J. Simpson All the while shareholders are not concerned by Apple dropping one or more or all of the big 3 carriers in Canada, or that the carriers have dropped Apple. It’s Me Unlikely to be all 3….unless they are negotiating with Apple together, which might be an anti-trust conflict on it own. Again, you keep bringing up breaching. That isn’t likely a threat on either side because makes little sense. But using leverage in negotiations? Why is that such a difficult concept for you? Seems like a simple concept almost anyone would be familiar with. Even a child learns to negotiate fairly young. Anyway, clearly this isn’t going anywhere and I’m not sure if it’s because you are intentionally being obtuse or if simple things like leverage and negotiation are really such difficult concepts. Either way I don’t see much value in repeating the same explanations over and over and taking in circles. So, have a good night. It’s Me Deleted. Replied to wrong post. Homer J. Simpson Okay next time your boss is penalizing you for always being late, you just go to the police and tell them that a drug dealer is forcing you to buy and use drugs from him, so you can’t focus and get to work on time. That’ll get the police attention focused on the drug dealer and not get you fired. Good night. Brad Fortin This should come as no surprise to anyone except the most hardcore of Apple haters. thereasoner Can’t blame anyone for thinking the worst considering the lowlife douchebags that run Apple. This is the same company that organized an eBook price fixing scam that ripped off hundreds of millions from their own customers after all. Only blind fanatical iFans would place trust in that despicable company obviously ! Jon Fingas I don’t think the price agreements were right, but keep in mind what they were a response to: Amazon price dumping (that is, selling below cost ) to squeeze rivals out of the market. It’s like moving back to the swamp because you don’t enjoy living in the sewers. Neither is ideal, but you’re just trading one problem for another. It’s Me Yup. Fanatics like thereasoner conveniently omit or forget facts like amazon was [close to] a monopoly at the time and Apple had almost 0 market share. Yet the case was against the party with no market share while ignoring the predatory pricing practice of dumping by the dominant party. But he gets off on bashing Apple so it’s understandable. He might be kind of conflicted right now. Talking about ebooks appears to give him wood but this article clearly Apple of any wrong doing here might leave him flaccid. thereasoner Brad, Apple deserves all the “bashing” they have received for this one. It’s one of their most despicable, not to mention illegal acts, that they’ve have ever committed. You need not be a “fanatic” to despise those who steal from you. To defend said behavior on the other hand…. It’s Me What did they steal? Do you not even understand what they were charged with? Did they act even affect you? It must have since you claim that’s why you dispise them. But if it didn’t, that’s a pretty poor attempt at rationalizing your fanaticism…just evidence of it in fact. Maybe if you’d stayed in school you would understand. Then again, school isn’t for everyone. We need mindless labourers. So, you have that 🙂 thereasoner I love it when you cry and resort to ad hominem attacks every time you find yourself unable to defend your God Apple. You really have no idea just how amusing it is! It’s Me What as hom do you imagine? Facts aren’t insulting. They are simply facts. Are you in your mid 50s and doing mindless labour? Check. Poorly educated? Check. If you’d be able to continue your education don’t you think that would have been advantageous? Being better educated is better…duh. You might consider those insulting, but that’s your own insecurities coming out. It’s your life after all. Jon Fingas What Amazon did could easily be construed as illegal. As was mentioned, price dumping is anti-competitive when a dominant company uses it to starve rivals out of business. Intel, for example, had to pay billions in fines and settlements for using price dumping to hurt AMD’s market position. This doesn’t excuse any collusion, but portraying Apple as vile while Amazon is just conducting business as usual? That’s objectively, unquestionably wrong. thereasoner I’m making it as Apple unquestionably did something illegal by fixing e-book prices and stealing from consumers while Amazon did nothing out of the ordinary, much less illegal. Unless of course you have a link to Amazons conviction of “price dumping”, theft from consumers and subsequent fines for doing so…. Crickets,…. You’re right about one thing though. It wouldn’t excuse Apple regardless but in my view comparing a loss leader strategy to what went down between AMD and Intel is an act of desperation from an unethical company that got caught red handed. Homer J. Simpson Not sure that’s what happened with Intel. Intel actually had terms and contracts with manufacturers and gave discounts if they were to not buy from competitors. That was what was wrong. That’s not what Amazon is doing. PeterC Somethings are illegal when you have a monopoly, but Amazon never had a monopoly in ebook sales. Look up the legal/business definition of monopoly. It’s Me That is correct, that some activities are illegal only for a monopoly. But amazon was and is much closer to the legal definition of a monopoly in books and ebooks than Apple ever was. They were and are the 800lbs gorilla yet their activities get a pass. thereasoner What Amazon was doing is called a “loss leader”, they underprice so to attract people to their store presumably so customers also buy other products that are not loss leaders. It’s a very common practice in various business, even grocery stores do it and most importantly it is NOT illegal while it simultaneously gives consumers a good deal. What Apple did to fix e-book price was indeed ILLEGAL, they were fined almost half a BILLION dollars for it and it not only DIDN’T offer the consumer any benefit it simultaneously stole HUNDREDS of MILLIONS from them while Apple padded their coffers with said STOLEN cash. “trading one problem for another”? Are you serious? I almost peed my pants I was laughing so hard at that one! It’s Me Actually, when a monopoly player with dominant market control dumps product at a loss to hurt competitors that is often considered anti-competitive. The judge in the case even mentioned that a case could be brought against amazon for anti-competitive behaviour. But, when the president of the US sleeps at your house and you are one of his biggest donors and fundraiser, the threat of action is slim. thereasoner Sounds like a whole lot of paranoia and sour grapes from fanboys of a company that got caught red handed to me. Jon Fingas is correct as at least he will recognize that lame excuse doesn’t excuse Apple from it’s unethical theft from consumers regardless. Not to mention that it says a lot about Apple executives if their reaction to what they perceive to be unfair business practices from another company is to steal from their own customers! No matter how you fanatical fanboys spin it the executives at Apple come out of it as the low life anti-consumer douchebags that they are. But hey, at least now with a new President your pariniod theory about favouritism can now be proven…..NOT, lmfao!! It’s Me again, you are confused. What theft do you keep going on about? See, school would have helped your reading abilities and you wouldn’t be stuck making things up. Did you even get your high school diploma or was that as waste of time too? Honest question. Sometimes you seem like maybe you do and sometimes it seems like maybe grade 9 was the end. Vito R. I enjoy your anti-Apple bias and inability to admit when you’re wrong. Please never change. Homer J. Simpson Apple forced publishers to withhold books from Amazon unless Amazon raised the price to what Apple wanted. Amazon, on the other hand, discounts their own e-books at no profit or a loss to get more customers for their other products. There’s a difference between force setting a price for rivals and discounting your own sale items as a promotional strategy. It’s Me No. That’s not even close to what happened. Apple sought agreements from the publisher to use the agency model so publisher set prices instead of retailers. And they sought MFN status, meaning that if a competitor like amazon decided to dump books at a loss, as they regularly did, Apple would be allowed to see at the same price. Homer J. Simpson Yeah… so essentially Apple forced Amazon to raise their prices because publishers now set the price and terms. If they can’t come to this agreement, publishers would withold the books from Amazon. How is this not what I said? It’s Me Amazon wasn’t forced to do anything. You said Apple forced publishers to withhold their books from amazon, which was fiction. That amazon choose to do anything, given their massively dominant position in the market, ca only be called laughable to say they were forced to do anything. Keep trying. It does seem like the regular circIejerk crew is agreeing with you but that’s hardly surprising. It’s the nature of circIejerks…no one needs to think. Homer J. Simpson Steve Jobs actually said the words that publishers were withholding from Amazon when asked about prices of ebooks from Apple vs Amazon. Here is an excerpt from the court documents downloaded from justice gov website said about what Jobs said: “Jobs’s statements to James Murdoch that he understood the Publishers’ concerns that “Amazon’s $9.99 price for new releases is eroding the value perception of their products . . . and they do not want this practice to continue,” and that Apple was thus “willing to try at the [$12.99 and $14.99] prices we’ve proposed,” underscored Apple’s commitment to a scheme with the Publisher Defendants to raise e-book prices. Jobs’s purchase of an e-book for $14.99 at the Launch, and his explanation to a reporter that day that Amazon’s $9.99 price for the same book would be irrelevant because soon all prices will “be the same” is further evidence that Apple understood and intended that Amazon’s ability to set retail prices would soon be eliminated. When Jobs told his biographer the next day that, in light of the MFN, the Publisher Defendants “went to Amazon and said, ‘You’re going to sign an agency contract or we’re not going to give you the books,’” Jobs was referring to the fact that Sargent was in Seattle that very day to deliver Macmillan’s ultimatum to Amazon.” Now if you want to get into the details saying that Apple technically didn’t directly force Amazon to raise their prices to what the publishers set to, but emails sent by Apple to publishers actually discussed plans to eliminate retail pricing and raise ebook prices by at least $3 and that all resellers of new titles need to be in the agency model. However you want to look at it, that to me is Apple forcing Amazon because they were aware of Amazon and that clause would be forced on Amazon as well. It’s Me Again, that’s not forcing amazon to do anything and certainly it isn’t Apple forcing them. Jobs might have anticipated that amazon would switch, but given amazon’s far and away dominant position in the market, they could have stayed with the wholesale model instead. The best you can say is that Apple colluded with the publishers to have them pressure amazon. But Apple, with zero market share, could hardly force amazon to do anything. Homer J. Simpson Amazon is forced to give up the business of selling new titles if they were to stick with the wholesale model, thereby forcing them to agree to the agency model and raise the ebook prices. If your significant other tells you to either get rid of the cat or he/she is out of your life, is that not forcing you to compromise? It’s Me If your significant other forces you, then they forced you. But her best friend who encouraged her to do it wasnt the one that forced you. The best friend might have encouraged it and even benefitted from it, but they weren’t in a position to force anything on you. Homer J. Simpson In this scenario, her best friend gave her the ultimatum that if she didn’t give you this ultimatum, she would no longer be her friend. That’s not the same thing as encouraging. It’s Me Of course it is. The best friend has no leverage over you. And the best friend was a new friend and had no established relationship with your wife, so she wouldn’t even have much leverage over your wife. But it all comes down to the relationship between you and your wife, not the best friend. Homer J. Simpson I see. So your explanation says Apple didn’t practice anti-competition and that they didn’t come to a contractual agreement with the publishers to force all other resellers to switch to the agency model. The judges were all just wrong about everything and the verdict is clearly wrong. Got it. It’s Me There was nothing contractual to force other retailers to the agency model. In fact, Apple initially rejected the agency model. Once they did decide to use they did indeed suggest that the publishers should switch other retailers to agency. But they dropped that suggestion completely in favour of MFN status…because with MFN, Apple would benefit if the other retailers stayed on the wholesale model because they’d be allowed to match prices and still take a 30% cut. Amazon could have stayed wholesale and it would have benefited Apple if they did so. That they chose to switch in order not to let Apple have that advantage was their choice. The publishers would benefit greatly if amazon switched to agency and since they granted MFN status to Apple, they’d actually lose out if only Apple went agency. Homer J. Simpson Right got it. Apple was innocent. Thanks for clarifying. It’s Me They might be guilty, just not of what you claim. At least not exactly. Homer J. Simpson You should become an attorney. It’s Me Have too many in my family as it is. PeterC Good job telling half the story. Apple wanted the publishers to set the price but Apple also had a clause that said they could not sell books anywhere cheaper than Apple’s store. So if Amazon negotiated a good deal with publishers, Apple’s clause said books sold in Apple’s store have to be same or cheaper price. That doesn’t sound like Apple letting publishers decide the price. It’s Me Um, the agency model, by definition is letting the publishers set the price. That’s not half the story, that is the story, whether you understand that or not. The MFN clause didn’t say publisher couldn’t sell for lower prices, it said that if any retailer sold a book for cheaper, then Apple had the right to match that price. Price matching is sort of a well established practice in retail. PeterC No surprise? Meaning it was obvious Apple did nothing wrong? Please show some evidence that it was obvious Apple was the “good guy” It’s Me Show evidence they weren’t…that’s how things work. Are you often asked to present evidence you aren’t a criminal? Should you have to be asked? PeterC That is for a criminal trial. This was just an investigation. If it was obvious Apple did nothing wrong, the investigation wouldn’t have taken years. Stop being a drama queen. Vito R. You obviously don’t know how government agencies work – nothing is ever done quick. They even *stated* at the beginning of the”investigation” that they had no evidence Apple did anything wrong. I feel this was all just a make work project for them. It’s Me Umm, any investigation or accusation should be supported with facts, sorry that’s inconvenient to your narrative. You might be of the opinion that one must prove ones innocence instead of the accuser having to prove their case, but thankfully we don’t live in such a dumb and backward world. That would suck. Supa_Fly Bravo! Slow clap … 🙂 well done Brad Fortin That’s not the way it works. If you make a claim that Apple is a “bad guy” you have to present evidence to support your claim. Scazza Hey thanks for the call out, sorry for the late reply, I don’t sit at home in mommas basement hitting F5 all day, so forgive me for not rushing in here to “admit I’m wrong”. Nothing I said in the original post from awhile back was false. I’ve worked in the industry for years and Apple does have many rules that carriers must follow that can create what some would deem unfair. The big one being threat of removal of the license to sell Iphones if you don’t follow along with their insane agreements. So much so that their agreements state in caps something along the lines of “under penalty of being barred from selling iphones” that everyone must abide by, including individual retailers and carriers. Using that threat to bully retailers into following some rules like exclusive advertising, or forcing retailers to purchase demo units or face not being a licensed retailer. So if the competition bureau finds that to be fair, sounds good, and yes I was wrong. However their tactics and threats are unique to them, and no other oem goes to the lengths that Apple does. TheCuddlyKoala Apple-1, Canada-0 It’s Me Canada didn’t lose anything except wasted tax dollars. Apple didn’t win anything except a waste of resources. The only winners were the carriers who managed to confuse the dimwitted. Cowpoke Apple FTW, dude-bro. Supa_Fly Nothing is wasted by Apple … this gave them free press equaling Brand Name Recognition in the positive light. It’s Me Well, other than 2 years of bad press, repeated constantly by the usual muppets, that they were guilty. RichieRich Hmm… Apple is “dominant” in the Canadian market? Funny. There are those on this site who would have you believe there are a dozen iPhone owners in Canada. Once the iPhone 8 sells 180 million, no doubt a majority of which will be in North America, we should see some fun discussions here. PeterC From the source statement from the Competition Bureau, “… Abuse of a dominant position occurs when a dominant firm … in a market engages in a practice of anti‑competitive acts, __with the result that competition has been … lessened substantially.__ As the Bureau has not found sufficient evidence to suggest Apple’s current practices have substantially lessened or prevented competition in any relevant market, or are likely to do so, the inquiry has been discontinued.” The important part is the highlighted part, “WITH the result that competition has been … lessened substantially.” So what the Competition Bureau is saying is since Apple doesn’t have a dominant market share, those contract clauses Apple has with carriers are ok. Supa_Fly Especially since there are MORE Android devices sold across Canada for just about all providers named than Apple devices. Cowpoke Sal Lovin’ the new homepage, y’all!

BUT can it survive its biggest challenges? In a year full of milestones, 2016 became the first time ­streaming overtook sales as the music industry's dominant model, accounting for 51.3 percent of album consumption and besting physical and downloads combined, ­according to Nielsen Music. Now in 2017, a series of factors are ­converging that could leave some of its most significant players behind. First, the good news: Streaming led the U.S. music industry to its first back-to-back yearly growth this millennium and in the first half of 2016 was the single ­highest source of revenue in the U.S. recorded-music industry, ­bringing in $1.61 billion. All three major labels -- Universal, Sony and Warner -- posted streaming-driven double-digit percent boosts in earnings throughout the year. And subscriber growth overall has consistently increased ­during the past few years; in 2016, Spotify and Apple Music together added more than 20 million ­subscribers, ­boosting their ­numbers to 40 ­million and 20 ­million, respectively. But that growth has attracted new competitors to the space, as digital giants Pandora, ­iHeartRadio and Amazon all debut their own on-demand streaming services. Along with established offerings like Spotify, Apple Music and Google Play, not to mention YouTube, there will soon be nearly a dozen on-demand music streaming services in the United States alone. Which of them can survive in such a ­competitive market? "I think 'consolidation' is a great word for what's coming next," says Chris Carey, CEO of Media Insight Consulting. "Smaller companies won't go away, but you might see acquisitions from them in order to catch up." Currently, the big players, Spotify and Apple Music, have turned the quest for on-demand market share into a two-horse race, which means the clock could be ticking for smaller stand-alone companies like SoundCloud and Tidal, both of which have been linked to acquisition rumors (Google is reportedly eyeing the former for $500 million). In order to survive, streamers will need to offer more, or different, value than the market leaders already have. One example will be different price points and new services, as incoming players look to ­undercut the currently standard $9.99/month all-access model. iHeart and Pandora have already ­negotiated direct deals with labels to offer enhanced radio at $4.99 that includes offline listening and replay functions, while Amazon, through discounts for its Prime members ($7.99/month) and owners of its hugely successful voice-activated home assistant Echo ($3.99/month), has made similar moves. "It's difficult to have more than a couple of really big, all-things-to-all-people services," says MiDia Research founder Mark Mulligan. "Amazon is trying to open up a different customer base, but for big companies like Pandora wanting to create another global player, the dice is very much loaded against them." Where does Apple Music fit in? The clear No. 2 has had impressive growth since its June 2015 launch, but its marketing magic bullet -- exclusive album releases -- faded significantly following Universal Music Group boss Lucian Grainge's label-wide ban in August. "I don't know if ­catching Spotify needs to be the goal, but I think making Apple Music stronger is," says Russ Crupnick, managing partner at MusicWatch. "You don't want to put yourself in a situation where you're losing ground." Indeed, several analysts agree that the streaming landscape in 2017 will be dominated by Spotify and its long-rumored IPO, expected to arrive around September. "Spotify's IPO will have a bigger impact at the ­industry level than any other ­company in any other major industry," says Mulligan. "If ­successful, you'll see an influx of capital, new services and ­revenue for labels, ­publishers, artists and ­songwriters. If not, you'll see potential ­investments fall through and ­questions about the model. Successful or not, it will shape the market." Spotify lost nearly $200 million in 2015 on $2.2 billion in revenue, and the company's $1 billion round of convertible debt, raised in March 2016, will require hefty interest payments the longer the company stays private. If CEO Daniel Ek does take the company public, it doesn't need to be profitable; Netflix never turned a profit before its IPO in 2002, for instance, and now boasts a valuation north of $50 billion. But analysts tell Billboard that Spotify needs to show a clear path to profitability in order to attract wary potential stockholders. Yet there's plenty of room for optimism, even if smaller services eventually bow out of the race. A U.S. Department of Commerce report from October estimates that global streaming revenue will ­balloon to $5.4 billion by 2019, while a study by IHS Markit expects the number of U.S. on-demand ­subscribers to triple by 2020. "It's going to be a three-horse race among Spotify, Apple and Amazon as the dominant players," offers Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG Research. Counters Carey, "I think four services with different focuses, all looking after consumers and none driving price down, would be your ideal situation ... Whether or not I'm living in a dreamland is a different question."

Voice-controlled gadgetry has been the dominant theme of CES 2017, the trade show that sets the annual agenda for the consumer electronics industry. Much of the talk has focused on domestic devices such as the Amazon Echo and the apparent battle for control of the living room, but the significance of the voice UI extends far further. Take smartwatches for example. What should have been obvious from the start is now painfully apparent in the early decline of the segment – a touch UI is useless on a 1.5-inch screen. Clearly we need another way of interacting with wearable tech if it is to become genuinely useful, rather than merely a piece of early-adopter bling. If you think about it the touch UI is only really useful for smartphones and tablets. People still use the good old keyboard and mouse for productivity and the smartphone largely failed to supplant the time-honoured remote control for the telly. Yes, touchscreens are increasingly cropping up in retail environments, but those are still mainly variations on the tablet theme. The mass market is currently and understandably reluctant to drop 400 notes on a tiny, defeatured smartphone, But what if, when paired with some discrete wireless headphones, all input was voice and all output audio? The smartwatch could then supplant the smartphone in all non-visual tasks, including messaging, navigation, even reading via text-to-voice. The phone could then be relegated to the role of video consumption device much as the tablet already has in many homes. The Holy Grail of the voice UI era, however, has to be automotive – the definitive hands-free environment. While texting-and-driving is on the decline thanks to aggressive law enforcement, car infotainment systems are becoming increasingly complicated and are all, of course, touchscreen based. We are rapidly reaching the point where interacting with infotainment systems is no less distracting than using a phone. The solution, once more, is voice. If the in-car voice UI was sufficiently intuitive, responsive and comprehensive then you could keep your eyes on the road and your hands upon the wheel (to paraphrase The Doors) at all times. Even things like headlights and windscreen wipers could be controlled by voice, let alone all the clever new digital stuff even the writers of kitsch 80s TV hit Knight Rider would barely have dreamed of (see clip below). And with all due respect to the Digital Living Room, or whatever we’re calling the smartification of that part of the house, the potential offered by automotive for the tech sector on the whole is far greater. While telling Alexa to play some music is nice-to-have, talking to your car will soon become a must-have and the winner of voice UI is likely to win the connected car too. Once we’ve cracked the connected car we’ll move seamlessly to the driverless car, which on first consideration might make all this talk of voice UI moot, given the absence of said driver. However the main use of these autonomous vehicles, on which the stagnating global car industry is counting, will be as taxis, and if anything they will need a robust voice UI even more than regular cars to take requests from punters. So what’s all this got to do with Apple, you might reasonably ask, having gullibly fallen for our click-bait. The answer right now is: very little, and that’s the point. Microsoft was the winner of the keyboard and mouse UI era, Apple of the touch era, but so far Amazon and Google are making all the running in voice. Ford, for example, announced support for Alexa in its SYNC 3 AppLink connected car platform at this very CES (see second video clip). As The Verge points out Apple is still wrestling with the digital home and not doing even much of a job with that. The standard Apple walled-garden approach is manifested in this setting via HomeKit, which allows third parties to make smarthome kit that can be controlled via iOS devices. Apple may end up getting this right but HomeKit still focuses on the touch UI of iPhones and iPads while competitors are effectively using the living room as a testing ground for their voice initiatives. Even victory in the living room for Apple could prove Pyrrhic. The irony of all this is that Apple was a voice UI pioneer via Siri, which marked the first voice-controlled digital assistant to be launched natively on a smartphone back in 2011 in the iPhone 4S. To be fair Apple has integrated Siri into things like the Apple Watch and its CarPlay infotainment effort, but the criticism Siri received five years ago still applies – it’s just not useful enough yet. This is the real reason why Apple should be worried about the early lead Amazon and Google are establishing in voice UI via Alexa and Assistant. In the relatively benign, low-risk environment of the living room they can field-test their voice UIs, continue to evolve the AI platforms that drive them, and find out what end-users actually find useful. Maybe Apple will prove us wrong and is just waiting until CES finishes to deliver one of its seismic, epoch-defining reveals. This doesn’t seem likely, however, and history is replete with dominant companies failing to read the writing on the wall. We’re not saying CES 2017 is Apple’s Kodak moment, but it risks losing touch with its competition if it doesn’t raise its voice game soon.     Tags: Amazon, Apple, CES 2017, Connected car, featured, Google, smartwatch, voice UI Leave a comment Cancel reply Connect with: -or- Log in with your Telecoms.com account Alternatively, post a comment by completing the form below: Your email address will not be published.

 Tim Cook and other top Apple executives took a pay cut in 2016 for missing targets Alex Heath Jan. 6, 2017, 11:09 AM 3,556 facebook linkedin twitter email print Tim Cook.Getty Images/Chip Somodevilla Apple CEO Tim Cook and other top executives at the company were paid less in 2016 for missing performance targets, Apple disclosed on Friday. The company's top brass took home a combined 89.5% of their potential cash incentive payouts for the year. Cook specifically received $8.75 million in total compensation, which is a 15% decrease from the $10.3 million he was paid in 2015. "Overall, our 2016 performance with respect to net sales and operating income was 7.7% and 15.7% below our record-breaking 2015 levels; however, the 2016 payouts to our named executive officers were significantly less than the annual cash incentive payouts for 2015, reflecting strong pay-for-performance alignment," Apple said in a regulatory filing with the SEC on Friday. iPhone sales, which make up the bulk of Apple's revenue, declined each quarter in 2016 on a year-over-year basis. That slowed growth culminated in the company reporting its first annual revenue decline in 15 years last quarter. Cook reached his five-year mark as Apple's CEO in August 2016, unlocking 1.26 million shares of Apple stock worth around $135 million. He sold about $36 million of his stock at the time and still has 3.5 million shares that are set to vest over the next five years, depending on performance.

We predict the iPhone 8 release date, UK price, tech specs, new features and more. Latest: the CEO of a charging company has been dropping hints that the iPhone 8 could feature a wireless charging range of 15 feet; supply-chain sources predict a stainless steel chassis; and a noted blogger says the iPhone 8 redesign will be "a big f**king deal and will change this industry deeply" by David Price | 06 Jan 17 Share Tweet   Comments Contents Release date Design New features Specs Macworld poll - What do you want from your future iPhone? When will the new iPhone 8 be released in the UK, and how different will it be from the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus? (Or will the next generation of Apple smartphones be called the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus?) And what tech specs and new features should we expect from Apple's new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus? The iPhone 8 rumour mill is heating up, a month after the launch of the iPhone 7. Apple unveiled the new iPhone 7 alongside its bigger sibling the iPhone 7 Plus during a special event on 7 September, but we're already looking ahead to the next generation. In this article we round up all the rumours about the iPhone 8: the iPhone 8's UK release date (and onsale date), iPhone 8 UK price, iPhone 8 specs and new features. There's a lot to cover, so let's get started. For advice on the current iPhone range, read our iPhone buying guide and best cheap iPhone deals UK. Or, if you'd like to look even further into the future (covering tech developments that come perilously close to the realms of science-fiction), read iPhone 9 and beyond: From graphene to motion charging. Updated, 10 January 2017, with reports that the iPhone 8 will be made of stainless steel; on 6 Jan, to discuss cryptic comments that point to 15-foot wireless charging and a 5.8-inch screen; on 4 Jan, with reports of fast-charging tech and tap to wake coming to the iPhone 8; and on 20 Dec 2016, with reports of plastic screens and 'new sensing technologies' that could move Touch ID to the side of the iPhone 8. iPhone 8 release date rumours UK | iPhone 8 specs: Release date Some pundits predicted that the iPhone 7 would sell comparatively poorly because of its perceived lack of major new features and design changes. But, they said, everything would change in 2017, when the iPhone 8 blows everyone away with a wide and radical range of enhancements. Pundits are increasingly predicting a big iPhone launch in 2017. Making predictions about the upcoming performance of Apple stock, analysts at Credit Suisse have forecast that the iPhone 8, to be released on the iPhone's 10-year anniversary in 2017 (skipping the 'S' generation in recognition of its major updates) will feature "significant innovations" such as a full-glass OLED screen, new and upgraded haptic feedback features, wireless charging and numerous major specs improvements including the camera and processor. Kulbinder Garcha, one of the company's analysts, was sufficiently confident about the iPhone 8's performance to predict sales of 250 million units in fiscal 2018 (despite launching in the calendar year 2017, the iPhone 8's sales will be reported in 2018), compared to 215 million in 2017. Garcha may be confident, but we're not so sure. Going three years between substantive updates to what remains by far its most profitable line in order to make a big launch match a big anniversary feels like a strange and risky strategy for Apple (we don't subscribe to Nikkei's theory that the company will follow a three-year cycle from now on), and with the Android sector pushing boundaries in a lot of ways this would inevitably result in accusations of stagnation - even more so than now.

It might not get pretty, if some researchers are to be believed. One analyst, Andrew Uerkwitz, has predicted that the 2017 iPhone refresh will be the company's "last growth hurrah", before spiralling into a "decade-long malaise" as the market turns increasingly to lower-cost and second-hand phones. "The risks to the company have never been greater," Uerkwitz said to MarketWatch. Monness Crespi Hardt analyst James Cakmak echoed Uerkwitz's sentiments. "Apple won't have it easy again for a while, if ever," he said. iPhone 8 release date rumours: Apple's release schedule Before we think about new features you should expect in the iPhones of the future, let's talk about the likely release date schedule. Apple's latest batch of smartphones, the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, were released in the autumn of 2016. (Read more: iPhone 7 review and iPhone 7 Plus review.) After that point it gets harder to predict. Based on the past few years of Apple launches, the generation after that logically ought to be an S update: the iPhone 7s and the iPhone 7s Plus, launched together in autumn 2017 (with the potential of an iPhone SE 2 in spring of 2017, or moved back to launch with them in the autumn). The iPhone 8 - as well as the iPhone 8 Plus - would then finally be unveiled in September 2018. Sept 2016: iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Mar 2017: iPhone SE 2 Sept 2017: iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus Mar 2018: iPhone SE 3 Sept 2018: iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus But it may not be that simple. iPhone 8 release date rumours: The end of the iPhone 'S' convention It's possible that Apple won't continue the S generation strategy for much longer. Many of us have pointed out that this 'tick-tock' system is a risky policy, tacitly acknowledging that iPhone generations alternate between major and minor updates - to be especially harsh, you could say worthwhile and superfluous updates. When the average user hears that the new iPhone hasn't even been considered worthy of a full version number upgrade, they'll be put off from spending money on the new offering. Not to mention that an S update is more confusing for buyers: iPhone 6 followed by iPhone 7 would have been clear and easy to understand; but it's less obvious which out of the iPhone 6, 6s, 6 Plus and 6s Plus is the more advanced model. On this principle, therefore, we could see the iPhone 7 in autumn 2016 and the iPhone 8 the year after. At this point, nobody knows - but as soon as we hear more, we'll update this article. And in October 2016 a little extra weight was added to the 'iPhone 8 in 2017' theory. According to Business Insider, an Apple employee in Israel who solders components spoke to them about the next iPhone and referred to it as the iPhone 8 "unprompted in our conversation". The sourced added that the iPhone 8 would be "different" from the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7, and have a better camera - neither of which are particularly out-there predictions. iPhone 8 release date rumours: Can Donald Trump persuade Apple to build iPhones in the US? Donald Trump spent much of his recent presidential campaign complaining about Apple and its offshore manufacturing operations, and promising he would make the company build its iPhones in the US. (The only major Apple product currently made on American shores is the Mac Pro.) Now, as President-Elect Trump, he's trying to make his promises a reality. Speaking to the New York Times, Trump claimed to have spoken on the phone with Tim Cook - implying, indeed, that Cook initiated the call - and reached what sounds like a degree of understanding you might not expect from two men with such different temperaments and political leanings. "I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.' He said, 'I understand that.'" Read next: Where are Apple products made? Apple has its reasons for building its smartphones in Asia, of course: labour costs are lower and there is, according to Cook, a shortage of relevant skills in the US. Moving manufacturing to America would lose Apple a lot of money. But Trump thinks he can sweeten the deal with tax cuts and changes to regulations. "I said: 'I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it. We're going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you'll be happy about.' But we're going for big tax cuts, we have to get rid of regulations, regulations are making it impossible. Whether you're liberal or conservative, I mean I could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous. It's gotten to be a free-for-all. And companies can't, they can't even start up, they can't expand, they're choking." What Trump does not claim - and past behaviour suggests he'd be singing it from the rooftops - is that Cook actually agreed to any of this, even in principle. He may understand where Trump is coming from, and Trump may have given him the hard sell, but it would be a huge step if Apple actually does move any kind of significant proportion of its device manufacture to the US. Foxconn's US expansion There was another twist in this tale when it emerged on 7 December that iPhone manufacturer Foxconn is indeed pondering an expansion of its (currently relatively small-scale) US operations, in a move that is apparently expected to involve $7bn of investment and create 50,000 jobs. Strangely, nobody involved made much of a deal about this. But eagle-eyed journalists spotted that paperwork being shown off to publicise SoftBank's US investment deal (which Donald Trump has made a huge song and dance about) also featured Foxconn's logo, and appeared to suggest that the second figure in each pair of numbers referred to that company. (Picture credit: CNBC) Foxconn has since confirmed that it is in talks about expanding its US operations, although it has declined to comment on the figures given. "While the scope of the potential investment has not been determined, we will announce the details of any plans following the completion of direct discussions between our leadership and the relevant US officials," the firm said in a statement, according to Reuters. Other Apple products made in the US Apple does build some products in the US, if rarely, and only in the cases of far lower-volume products than the iPhone. It has made a lot out of its US Mac Pro assembly, for instance, but this is a niche product made in comparatively low numbers. In January 2017 - a couple of weeks ahead of Trump's inauguration - Apple applied to expand the use of a manufacturing facility it owns in Mesa, Arizona. Rather than iPhones or even recognisable consumer products, Apple will be building data server cabinets for its own internal use, but any increase in the company's US footprint will add to speculation that Trump's pressure to increase home manufacture is having an effect. (The President Elect is quite canny at taking credit for things that are unrelated to - and sometimes precede - the actions he claims to have caused them, as the US automotive industry is currently discovering.) Now, what new features and tech developments can we expect in the next few generations of Apple smartphone? iPhone 8 release date rumours UK | iPhone 8 specs: Design iPhones are that lethal combination of expensive and fragile that results in so much consumer heartache. The result is that each iPhone owner has to make their own deal with the devil: either wrapping it in a robust case, thereby masking the handsome design that they paid all that money for in the first place, or risk pavement damage every time they take the thing out of a pocket. But design changes may mean this is not the case in the future. Here are the design changes we expect in the iPhone 8. Read next: How to repair a cracked iPhone screen iPhone 8 design: 10th-anniversary redesign will be 'a big f**king deal' The year 2017 (June the 29th, to be precise) marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and some suggest that Apple will want to come up with a real blockbuster of a redesign to celebrate. Noted tech blogger Robert Scoble has posted an exhaustive list of predictions for next year's iPhone, and he expects big things. "It's the 10th anniversary of the iPhone," he writes. "It's the first product introduction in Apple's new amazing headquarters. It's a big f**king deal and will change this industry deeply." (Those are Scoble's asterisks.) Design-wise, he expects that the iPhone 8 "will be, I am told, a clear piece of glass (er, Gorilla Glass sandwich with other polycarbonates for being pretty shatter resistant if dropped) with a next-generation OLED screen (I have several sources confirming this). You pop it into a headset which has eye sensors on it, which enables the next iPhone to have a higher apparent frame rate and polygon count than a PC with a Nvidia 1080 card in it." He also says to expect "battery and antennas to be hidden around the edges of the screen, which explains how Apple will fit in some of the pieces even while most of the chips that make up a phone are in a pack/strip at the bottom of the phone". But the range of features Scoble is expecting is overwhelming. You really need to read the post for yourself. Scoble isn't the only one predicting a big redesign for 2017. French site nowhereelse.fr has shared a leaked image (below), which appears to showcase the exact dimensions of the iPhone 7. These dimensions are identical to the ones found on the iPhone 6s, measuring 67.12mm wide and 138.3mm tall. Through this image, it would appear that there also won't be any change to the camera (there have been rumours about a dual camera system as you'll discover later in this article). The image has the OnLeaks stamp on it, and OnLeaks has been reliable with Apple leaks in the past. iPhone 8 design: Glass front and back, with stainless steel option 9to5Mac has got hold of a report from the ever-quotable and usually reliable Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities - a report that predicts, based on the popularity of the scratch-prone Jet Black iPhone 7, that the iPhone 8 will have a (more scratch-resistant) glass front and back. "If Apple does follow through with what KGI suggests, an all glass design could extend the glossy finish to all colours of the iPhone lineup depending on how Apple handles the design," 9to5mac says. DigiTimes (a Chinese-language website), predicts that the chassis of the iPhone 8 will be made of stainless steel and supplied by Jabil rather than the more usual manufacturing partner Foxconn, citing anonymous sources in the Asian /supply chain. This would be something of a surprise, given Apple's clear recent preference for aluminium; the iPhone 4s had steel bands around a glass body, but it's been all aluminium ever since. And we're given to understand that the engineering method will be different this time: whereas the iPhone 4s was milled, the iPhone 7 metalwork will be forged, a technique that offers greater strength. iPhone 8 design: New colour options There have been various rumours about new colour finishes, focusing on two possibilities: dark blue, and red. According to a report from Macotakara, the iPhone 7 will come in Silver, Gold, Rose Gold and a new Deep Blue. This seems entirely possible. Samsung offers blue flagship phones that seem to be among the more popular options, so Apple might decide to follow Samsung's lead. Following the reports from Mac Otakara, designer Martin Hajek has published some gorgeous concept images of the Deep Blue iPhone 7. See more over on Martin's website. (Shortly after the Deep Blue rumours emerged, a second colour rumour came to light on the same blog. Macotakara now said that Space Black would be introduced instead of Deep Blue to replace the current Space Grey option. And while the names were different - black and Jet Black, in fact - Apple did indeed replace Space Grey with black colour options. Does this leave Deep Blue for the next generation?) More recently, Macotakara has been reporting a new colour rumour, predicting that the 2017 iPhones will be available in red. iPhone 8 design: Apple Watch-style Digital Crown Some of the more out-there concept illustrators have considered the idea of Apple giving the iPhone 7 a rotating control, like the Digital Crown on the Apple Watch. But the rest of us thought it was a crazy idea. But it might just be so crazy that it actually happens, if a new Apple patent is anything to go by. The patent, spotted like so many of these things by Patently Apple, is illustrated with images of an iPad but is described in sufficiently broad terms that it could easily apply to an iPhone too. The patent suggests that the rotating control could to adjust volume, resize text and various other functions, and all of this makes a certain sense; but does anyone honestly think it's something Apple would really do with its elegant clean iPhone? Our strong suspicion is that this is one of those patents Apple and other tech companies periodically take out in order to mislead rivals and cover moonshot concepts that are extremely unlikely to lead anywhere. iPhone 8 design: No more bezels above and below screen Apple has been awarded a patent that covers the embedding of light sensors within the layers of a display, leading to speculation that the firm intends to remove the bezels from its next iPhone. Indeed, the patent - US Patent 9,466,653 - specifically describes the tiresome current necessity for bezels in the background section: "In a typical device, a light sensor is laterally displaced from an active display region of the display along a front face of the device. Additional space is therefore provided in common devices at the top, bottom, or side of the active display area to accommodate the light sensor." Instead, the patent proposes to integrate the sensor within the display: "The light sensor is a display-integrated light sensor that is integrated into the layers of the display. The light sensor may [be] interposed between the cover layer and another layer of the display such as the touch-sensitive layer, the light-generating layers, or another display layer." This is Fig. 11 of the patent's illustrations, showing "a display-integrated light sensor attached to a thin-film transistor layer of a bottom emission organic light-emitting diode display". Of course, another hardware element that's currently built into the bezel at the bottom of the iPhone is the Home button. Which leads to our next section...  iPhone 8 design: No more physical home button (and Touch ID built into the display) Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster (a well-known industry pundit, but one who has come in for a fair amount of ribbing after regularly predicting that Apple would launch a television), suggested the iPhone 7 wouldn't have a Home button, thanks to the new 3D Touch technology introduced with the iPhone 6s. He felt that the new tech provides Apple with a way to eliminate the home button, instead using the additional space to make the screen bigger or the device smaller. The issue with Munster's theory is that the Touch ID would need to move, as it is currently situated beneath the home button on Apple's iPhones and iPads. However, as we discuss below, Apple has been investigating ways to build the Touch ID sensor into the screen itself. Munster's speculation about the iPhone 7 didn't prove to be true, but may yet happen on the iPhone 8.  In the continuing march of miniaturisation, one of the elements of the iPhone design that's proved resistant to shrinkage is the bezel below the screen - it can't get much smaller than it already is because it needs to house the Home button. Which is why a recurring theory is that Apple will extend the screen down past the Home button, or even incorporate the Touch ID sensor that lives in the recent iPhones' Home button into the touchscreen. Technology that would facilitate such a development was recently announced by a biometric R&D company called Sonavation. The tech would enable Apple (which is known to use Gorilla Glass in its iPhones, even if the supplier is apparently not permitted to say this publicly) to run the screen vertically edge-to-edge, with no cut-out for the Home button. The Home button could occupy the same position but appear only when needed, much like the software keyboard; and the technology for Touch ID would be bonded to the underside of the screen at the appropriate point. Last year Apple filed a patent that appeared to back up the theory that it's looking into ideas like this. Patent application number 20150036065, for "a fingerprint sensor... incorporated in a display stack in an electronic device", was filed by a number of Apple's engineers in April 2014 and published recently. Here are some of the accompanying illustrations (although you should bear in mind that patent images are almost universally ugly, and shouldn't bear much resemblance to what the finished design would look like): The illustration in Fig. 1 above appears to show an iPhone that still has a Home button, and therefore doesn't increase the amount of screen area - what would be the point of that, you might wonder. But remember that this is to illustrate the concept, not to show what it would look like in practice. iPhone 8 design: Touch ID screen patent granted An update to this rumour: Apple has been granted a patent - a different one - that also appears to refer to a Touch ID fingerprint sensor that can work through a screen. Patent 9,460,332 describes a "Capacitive fingerprint sensor including an electrostatic lens": more intriguingly for our purposes, it states that "one or more other device components, such as a display stack and/or a touchscreen may be interposed between the contact surface of dielectric structure 202 and array 206 of capacitive sensing elements". iPhone 8 design: Touch ID sensors on the side of the device Korea Herald cites "a source familiar with the matter" when reporting that Apple is exploring "new sensing technologies" that could substantially change the way Touch ID works. "The upcoming iPhone may use new sensing technology," explains the site's source, "which enables the phone to respond when users touch any side of the device. But Apple may not adopt this technology." The source doesn't specify whether the new sensors are connected to Touch ID, but it seems likely: all the talk of removing bezels and physical Home buttons and expanding the screen is going to necessitate finding a new location for the fingerprint scanner. If the iPhone becomes able to sense and analyse fingerprints on any edge, that would even remove the need for a specific Touch ID 'action' - you'd just need to pick the phone up. iPhone 8 design: Changes to Home button Some rumours suggest Apple is working on keeping the Home button and adding more features to it. There are two patents that have sparked these rumours, so they're both something Apple has at least considered. The first is a dynamic home button that is sensitive to gestures: you'd be able to swipe across it, or lean a thumb in one direction to scroll the screen of a game, for example, that way.  The second is pretty far out there. Essentially the concept is this: the Home button on the iPhone would be able to 'pop up' on a little spring and turn into a sort of mini-joystick for playing games. There are plenty of iOS games that would benefit from a hardware controller (this explains the enduring popularity of Bluetooth gaming controller accessories) and this sounds like a lot of fun. But gamers remain only one section of the iPhone's audience, and it seems like a risky idea to potentially compromise the resilience of everyone's iPhone Home button (which has famously been very prone to breakage in the past) for a feature that would benefit only some users. Best iPhone (and iPad) games iPhone 8 design: A larger, longer earpiece While this may not be the most exciting rumour to hit the internet, the latest rumours suggest that the next iPhone is to feature a longer earpiece cutout. The rumour, first covered by Mac Otakara, states that in addition to a longer earpiece cutout, Apple is moving the ambient light sensor from the left-hand side to the right-hand side. The source is apparently manufacturers of LCD protective films on Alibaba.com that are apparently no lonoger receiving orders related to the upcoming iPhone.  While the rumour is unconfirmed and should be taken with a pinch of salt, but if true, it could mean that the iPhone 8 may not be compatible with iPhone 7 cases and screen protectors, even if the design is broadly the same. iPhone 8 design: Curved wraparound screen According to KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has often correctly predicted upcoming Apple products - the analyst think a forthcoming iPhone could feature a curved 5.8in AMOLED screen. If this rumour is to be true, there would be an understandable shift from Apple to get rid of the headphone jack and produce a smartphone which is immediately distinguishable over its competitors.  We're into the realm of patents here, which we would generally warn readers means we're talking about developments that could easily end up appearing in a shipped product several years down the line or not appearing at all - Apple, like most tech companies, routinely applies for far more patents than it's ever going to use. But this one has actually been granted (it was applied for a few years back) so it could be reasonably close to reality. Patent 9,146,590 refers to an "electronic device with wrap around display". And essentially it describes a curved screen that allows for more screen elements to be displayed without making the device significantly bigger. (Remember that the illustrations rarely represent what the designer has in mind. In theory the display could wrap entirely around the device, or at least extend over one edge like the Note Edge.) While the patent talks about a "flexible display assembly", it's important to note that this isn't a patent for a bendable screen: the flexible portion of the display is attached to the interior surface of the curved transparent housing, which "provides a rigid support structure that prevents deformation". Samsung Display could be set to make flexible OLED displays for the iPhone 8. The rumour stems from claims that Samsung is reaching out to display tech companies in South Korea that they're hoping will lend a hand with building the displays, as the order from Apple will be huge. Samsung may even be intending to invest billions in an new factory in which it'll manufacture the displays. At present, iPhones use LCD displays, but the Apple Watch uses a flexible OLED so it's certainly possible that Apple intends to bring the tech to the iPhone. We're not talking flexible in the same way as the patent above, though. It'll simply mean that the screen could curve around the design of the iPhone 8 more accurately, hinting further at an edge-to-edge display. It'll also likely be used to improve 3D Touch. iPhone 8 design: Plastic screen The Korea Herald report we linked to earlier also discusses the screen, and the site's "source familiar with the matter" predicts that the iPhone 8 will have a display that is curved and OLED - both rumours that we've heard before - and made of plastic, which is a new one to us. "The OLED versions of the new iPhone will all have curved screens as Apple ordered only plastic OLED - not glass - from Samsung Display," reports the source. "Samsung is capable of supplying a little less than 100 million units of curved OLED displays to Apple." iPhone 8 design: Sapphire iPhone screens are already far tougher than your average piece of glass (they're made of a proprietary material called Gorilla Glass), but they do sometimes crack or even shatter when dropped. Sapphire screens would be more resistant still, and Apple is already using sapphire in the display of the Apple Watch: it's possible that the company is now ready to import this material into its smartphone line-up. Rumoured plans to rely on an Apple-backed sapphire plant in Arizona (which had the capacity to manufacture 200 million 5-inch iPhone displays per year) fell through. But more recent reports suggest that long-term Apple supplier Foxconn is gearing up to build its own sapphire plant in Taiwan at a cost of $2.6bn. In August 2016, it was reported by Patently Apple that Apple filed patents for a curved glass iPhone with virtual buttons on the sides. If accurate, this could be somwhat like the rumoured OLED bar on the expected new MacBook Pro, but time will tell. The patent images also show a curved glass screen similar to that which we have now seen made popular by Samsung's Galaxy S6 edge and S7 edge. This has helped to fuel the rumours that Apple is planning a major redesign for the iPhone 8 to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the iPhone. Either way, it'll have to be signifcantly different to Samsung's efforts to avoid Apple being accused of plagiarism. Then again, most smartphones of the past decade have aped the original iPhone, so we're sure that wouldn't prove problematic for Apple - particularly since these patents show its legal right to product the devices in this way. Read more: What is Sapphire glass, and why is it a good idea for the iPhone? iPhone 8 design: Project Phire Corning, the company that makes Gorilla Glass, responded to the looming threat of sapphire glass in early 2015 with the announcement of an ultra-hardened composite material codenamed Project Phire. James Clappin, president of Corning Glass Technologies, told investors: "We told you last year that sapphire was great for scratch performance but didn't fare well when dropped. So we created a product that offers the same superior damage resistance and drop performance of Gorilla Glass 4 with scratch resistance that approaches sapphire." Apple never discusses the materials it uses for iPhone screens, but it's great news for consumers that suppliers are jousting to provide the best and most durable screen glass. Read more about Project Phire here. iPhone 8 design: Graphene Sapphire glass is already being used on the non-Sport models of the Apple Watch, and Project Phire appears to be in a reasonably advanced state of development, but we're getting closer to the realms of science-fiction. Graphite, the material used in standard pencils, is made up of stacks of sheets of carbon, each one only a single atom thick. This is why it's so good for writing: the layers naturally slide off on to the paper. But graphene is a different matter. Graphene is what you get if you're clever enough to isolate one of the layers in graphite, leaving you with a substance that's effectively two-dimensional. It's the thinnest substance known to man, about a million times thinner than a human hair, and for that matter quite possibly the strongest (it's 100 times stronger than steel) and a phenomenally good electrical conductor - 1,000 times better than copper. Oh, and it's virtually transparent, too. All of which makes graphene an exciting prospect for tech manufacturers. Most obviously, it would make for a tremendously durable coating material for the screen (and would lend itself to bendable displays, too) or indeed any part of the device; but it could really appear in almost any of the sections of this article. Graphene would be a superior replacement for silicon in processor chips, or could be used to make more efficient batteries and solar cells. It's marvellous stuff. We're also pleased to report that graphene is British - sort of. It was discovered by the Soviet-born physicist Andre Geim at the University of Manchester, where it continues to be studied. (Entertainingly, Geim is the only scientist so far to be awarded both a Nobel and an Ig Nobel prize.) If you'd like to read more about graphene, I strongly recommend the New Yorker's article on the subject. iPhone 8 design: Viscoelastic material Let's move on from the screen and talk about new durable materials for the rest of the iPhone. How about a bit of drop-resistance? Based on patent activity, Apple is devising a viscoelastic material that would absorb impacts. The material would cover Apple devices and make them survive drops far better. The patent could make sense in all of Apple's mobile devices and laptops, but the iPhone is the obvious area to begin. iPhone 8 design: Flexible iPhone In January 2015 Apple was awarded a patent that suggests that the company is investigating the idea of a flexible iPhone (and we're not talking about the Bendgate kind). The patent suggests that, by making the iPhone flexible, Apple could unlock a new range of controls: the user could open an app by bending the device in a particular way, for example, or use the flexibility to control a game. It's an intriguing if seemingly far-fetched concept. Additionally, a flexible iPhone flexible ought to be more resistant to impacts and therefore more durable. But we'll discuss a key element in the idea of a flexible iPhone - a screen that can bend without breaking - in the screen tech section. iPhone 8 release date rumours UK | iPhone 8 specs: New features That covers design. But what new features should we expect in the iPhone 8? iPhone 8 new features: Fast Charging According to Forbes citing infamous Apple leaker Sonny Dickson, the iPhone 8 could be the first entry in the iPhone series to feature fast charging technology. More specifically, Forbes claims that there will be a new "Tristar 3, Hydra" chip that manages the charging port. "In normal people words... [it] will include fast charging,", Dickson claims.  However, it's worth noting that if fast charging tech is included in the upcoming iPhone, it may not be compatible with existing fast charging standards as the tech isn't being produced by Qualcomm, which provides "Quick Charge" for Android devices. Will it happen? We assume so. It has been a feature long-requested by users, and is one readily available on most if not all of Apple's Android-based competitors.  iPhone 8 new features: Tap to wake According to Forbes, one of the three (yes, three) variants of iPhone 8 will feature 'tap to wake' technology that has been available for budget Android users for quite some time. While the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus (sporting the same design as the 6/7) will miss out on the technology, the all-new iPhone 8 should get the 'tap to wake' treatment. This strikes us as a little odd as it's a feature available on budget Android smartphones, so why wouldn't it be on Apple's flagship? Also, Forbes source claims that it's "currently on the roadmap" for the iPhone 8 only, so there's still a chance this may change before release later this year.  iPhone 8 new features: Smart connector Could the iPhone 8 get a smart connector, like those used on the 9.7in and 12.9in iPad Pro collection? Of course, as with any rumour/leak it's best to take it with a pinch of salt but according to a report from Mac Otakara, a forthcoming iPhone will feature a smart connector. Mac Otakara claims "the possibility is great" that earlier leaked images are "the real thing", and even went on to claim that the next iPhone could be as thin as 6.1mm, although there was no source provided for this information. More recently, Logitech (or Logi?) has launched the Logi Base, the first accessory to utilise the iPad Pro smart connector for charging capabilities. As first reported by AppleInsider, the Base uses magnets to easily line up the iPad Pro with the charger, providing users with something close to wireless charging. It also means that you can pick up the iPad and walk away without needing to unplug it. While it's specific to the iPad Pro, it gives you an idea about what a smart connector on an iPhone could be used for.  iPhone 8 new features: Wireless charging Wireless charging didn't arrive with the iPhone 7 as some had predicted (it has also been predicted for previous iPhone models stretching back some years), even though Apple has been offering the feature for a while now in the form of the Apple Watch's inductive charging. As iMore's Rene Ritchie points out, inductive charging hasn't been practical for the iPhone in previous years because the technology available at the time didn't work through an aluminium backplate, but the Apple Watch can offer wireless charging because it has a ceramic back. In July 2015 Qualcomm announced a wireless charging breakthrough that does work through metal. This was obviously too late for the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus which appeared only two months later, and didn't make it into the iPhone 7 either. But the technology may appear in the iPhone 8 generation. And the iPhone 8 may have a glass back in any case. Indeed, Foxconn - one of the large manufacturing firms that builds iPhones for Apple - is reported to be testing wireless charging modules that will be included in some or all of the 2017 iPhones (it would make a neat point of differentiation for the iPhone 8 Plus) if the tests prove satisfactory. The questions at this point relate to yield rate and profitability: Foxconn is exploring the practicality of producing large batches of the component to a satisfactory standard. In November 2016, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted in one of his Apple Insight research notes that Apple will bring wireless charging capabilities to the autumn 2017 iPhone handsets, thanks to the all-glass design, but warned that the firm may bundle the wireless charger with more expensive models only. The firm envisions a wireless pad for charging the phones, somewhat like the inductive charger that comes with the Apple Watch. Perhaps the iPhone 8 Plus will offer wireless charging out of the box, while iPhone 8 buyers will need to purchase the charging pad separately (in this scenario, obviously the phones would need to be chargeable via conventional means too); or it might be the lower storage capacity units that miss out on the bundled wireless charger. That's another accessory to put on your shopping list, then. Business Insider offers slightly more detail of Ming-Chi Kuo's predictions, clarifying that Pegatron is expected to be "the exclusive supplier of the wireless charger". Wireless charging sounds amazing, but we should stress that at the moment inductive charging has a very short range; so you wouldn't be able to just sit at your desk and have your iPhone (in your pocket) charge from the plug several feet away. Rather, you'd place the device on a wired mat. Convenient, but not quite as space-age as it might have sounded when we talked about 'wireless charging'. Long-range wireless charging We say that inductive charging is disappointingly short range, but Bloomberg reckons Apple is working on longer-range wireless charging, potentially charging at a distance of about 1 metre using near-field magnetic resonance. And while this seems more of a long shot, some cryptic comments from the CEO of a charging company suggest Apple may be planning something even more ambitious. Steve Rizzone, CEO of Energous, spoke to The Verge before CES 2017 and dropped some clanking great hints about the exclusive and secret "key strategic partnership" that the company signed a couple of years back and which has delayed the launch of its wireless charging tech... which has a range of 15 feet. "That 'key' partner is suspected to be Apple," observes The Verge, "and Energous - though declining to state its partner's name - is certainly happy to fuel the speculation. Rizzone says the partnership is with 'one of the largest consumer electronic companies in the world. I cannot tell you who it is, but I can virtual guarantee that you have products from this company on your person, sitting on your desk, or at home.'" If you can't wait until the iPhone 8 to start charging your iPhone wirelessly, read How to wirelessly charge your iPhone. iPhone 8 new features: Face-detection and iris-recognition In December 2014, USPTO awarded Apple a patent relating to a "personal computing device control using face detection and recognition". Current iPhones and iPads can be unlocked using just your fingerprint, thanks to the Touch ID sensor. But with this patent, future iPhones and other devices could be unlocked using facial recognition: effectively, your face becomes your password. More recently, DigiTimes has predicted - citing that old favourite, "industry sources" - that Apple is likely to launch iPhones equipped with iris-recognition technology in 2018, which should line up with the iPhone 8's launch. This rumour was reiterated at the end of August when Digitimes reported that Taiwan-based Xintec is expected to provide iris scanners to Apple for the iPhone launching in 2017, and that this would help boost the company's revenues significantly next year. Once this technology becomes widespread - and you should expect other firms to launch phones with the feature before Apple, with DigiTimes predicting that Samsung for one will get there in the second half of 2016 - you'll be able to unlock your iPhone by scanning your eye. Is that really more convenient than scanning a fingerprint, though? It's more excitingly futuristic, admittedly. iPhone 8 new features: Augmented reality and VR In the Facebook post by Robert Scoble we mentioned earlier, one of the more surprising and detailed predictions concerns augmented reality and VR. "Really amazing VR/AR/mixed reality is coming to a phone, and coming by the end of 2017," Scoble writes. "Apple's entrance into this new world is like when IBM came into the personal computing world. It is that important." He discusses the impact that a mixed-reality iPhone could have on the market, and predicts: "You'll look through the glass in mixed reality modes (think of a new kind of Pokemon game) either in the headset, or in your hand. Apple's purchase of Metaio is going to prove very key. I won't be shocked to learn that Peter Meier, CTO there, is in charge of the next iPhone strategy and has been for years." Scoble isn't the only pundit predicting that Apple - and the iPhone in particular - are about to plunge into the world of augmented reality. Business Insider claims that the company is already working on ways to integrate AR elements into the iPhone's Camera app. "By adding AR technology into the iPhone's camera software, Apple wants consumers to be able to point the phone at a real-world object and have it be recognised, according to Kris Kolo, director of the VR/AR Association and a board member of Flyby Media, an AR startup that was acquired by Apple earlier this year," writes the site. Business Insider further predicts that the iPhone's camera app will be able to recognise "and manipulate" faces in augmented reality. And we've spotted a recent Apple patent application that appears to back up all this speculation. Patent 9,488,488, for 'Augmented reality maps', describes the use of a mobile device to view live video of whatever is in front of the user, and to then superimpose images related to nearby places of interest on top of the video. "A user points a handheld communication device to capture and display a real-time video stream. The handheld communication device detects geographic position, camera direction, and tilt of the image capture device. The user sends a search request to a server for nearby points of interest. ... The handheld communication device visually augments the captured video stream with data related to each point of interest. The user then selects a point of interest to visit. The handheld communication device visually augments the captured video stream with a directional map to a selected point of interest in response to the user input." Read more: Apple VR and augmented reality rumours iPhone 8 release date rumours UK | iPhone 8 specs: Specs It's hard to predict precise specs this far in advance, but it's possible to draw some broad conclusions about where Apple is headed. Let's start with... iPhone 8 specs: Screen resolution A report by the Wall Street Journal prophesies that Apple has big things up its sleeve for the next iPhone's screen, after turning out smartphones with lower resolutions than their rivals for some years. (If you compare the iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7, for example, you'll see that Apple managed only a 760 x 1334 resolution on its 4.7-inch screen, in comparison to the 1440 x 2560 5.1-inch screen that Samsung had to offer. Comparison possibly isn't the right word to use when the difference is as pronounced as that.) The iPhone 8 will sit in Samsung's shadows no longer, according to the WSJ, which says Apple has asked suppliers to "submit prototype screens with better resolution than ones from Samsung". If this is true - and if the suppliers are able to match Apple's stipulation without pushing up price, weight or dimension, or reducing battery life or fire safety, to a degree that Apple finds unacceptable - then this would imply more than a tripling of the pixel count from one iPhone generation to the next. iPhone 8 specs: Screen size What's more, word is that screens are getting bigger in 2017. In November 2016, Barclays Research - via MacRumors - released a report predicting that the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus would have 5-inch and 5.8-inch screens respectively, compared to the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The analysts based the prediction on the testimony of sources within Apple's Asian supply chain. It's still early days, though: the analysts warned that the design "didn't sound 100% locked down", so Apple may yet change its mind. In January 2017 this theory was backed up by a source in Asia. DigiTimes predicts that Apple will launch a 5.8-inch iPhone in the second half of 2017, citing anonymous sources in the Taiwanese supply chain. "Apple will launch 4.7-, 5.5- and 5.8-inch new iPhone models in the second half of 2017," the site writes, "with TFT-LCD panels to be used in the former two models and AMOLED for the 5.8-inch one." There remains some confusion, however, about whether that 5.8-inch measurement will take into account the extra space provided by the screen's predicted curved edges. Indeed, it's possible that this 5.8-inch phone's chassis will be the same size as that of current Plus models, gaining 0.3 inches of diagonal screen size through the curved edges and the lack of bottom bezel and Home button. If you're wondering how Apple will fit in that extra screen real estate - will the phones be bulkier than the current handsets? - then fear not. It's understood that the larger screens will fit in bodies with the same dimensions as the current generation of phones, thanks to a bezel-free design. This has been on the cards for a while. On 5 March 2015, indeed, Apple filed a patent that would allow for a bezel-free device. An image render and concept by Marek Weidlich shows us what the iPhone might look like if it were to have no bezels. The conceptual idea looks great and would show that Apple is still innovating in the smartphone space. Similarly, according to a Wall Street Journal source, the iPhone 8 may feature an edgeless display - but what is that, exactly? According to the publication, Apple is to redesign the iPhone for the 10th anniversary and that the changes "could include an edge-to-edge organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screen" without a physical Home button. John Gruber also commented on the upcoming redesign, claiming that Apple is to remove the bezels surrounding the display, providing users with an iPhone that looks almost like a sheet of glass. If Apple kills off the bezel, it will need to find a new place to put the Home button. On which topic, it's believed that Apple is investigating including the fingerprint scanner into the display of a smartphone or tablet. In fact, Apple filed a patent describing a Touch ID display back in January 2013.  This technology means that you could place your finger on the display to scan it, instead of the Home Button. We're not sure if this technology was an original variation to the Home Button scanner found on the iPhone 5s, or if it'll be combined with the Haptics & Tactile technology to remove the Home Button on a future iPhone and replace it with a virtual onscreen button. The Barclays Research report we mentioned earlier also predicts that the iPhone 8 will have a curved screen. This broadly fits in with earlier predictions. Some while back Nikkei predicted that autumn 2017 will see a massive triple iPhone launch, and that the flagship model of this trio will feature a curved OLED screen that curves down over the sides. This is something we've already seen on rival devices, such as Samsung's S7 Edge and Note 7; it enables more screen space to be squeezed on to a device without making it any bigger, and you can also have notifications designed to be seen or activated on the edge of the screen. "There will be a 4.7-inch model, another that will be 5.5-inches and a premium handset that will be either 5.5-inches or larger equipped with a screen bent on the two sides," said Nikkei's source, who was said to be "familiar with Apple's plans". A company named Applied Materials, which already works with Apple, has dropped strong hints about ramping display demand from the company heading towards 2017, and this has been taken as evidence for the iPhone 8 incorporating an OLED screen. "Applied Materials reported an almost fourfold leap in orders for equipment to make displays, an early sign producers are retooling their manufacturing to meet Apple's demand for a new kind of organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screen," reports Bloomberg. This appeared to be confirmed on 29 October 2016 by Tai Jeng-wu, the president of Sharp, which makes smartphone displays for Apple. Tai, who was speaking to students at his old university, said: "The iPhone has been evolving and now it is switching from LTPS [low-temperature poly-silicon] to OLED panels. We don't know whether Apple's OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn't walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity." The OLED iPhone rumour has been knocking around for a while; in December 2015 it was predicted that OLED would come to the iPhone line in 2018 as a result of a partnership between Apple and Japan Display. Talking of Japan Display... that company uses a new technology that it calls "full active LCD", and some pundits believe that only one of the new iPhones next year will get OLED, while the other(s) have screens based on full-active LCD. The technology, which Japan Display describes as using "a new high-density wiring layout and new processing and module assembly technologies" is capable of making the bottom bezel of an iPhone "as narrow as the other three sides". Japan Display aims to start mass production by the end of March, 2017, according to Fool.com - in time for the iPhone 8 launch, then. iPhone 8 specs: Processor As everyone knows, the iPhones contain proprietary processor chips that you won't find in other smartphones: there's an A9 in the iPhone 6s, and we should get an A10 chip in the iPhone 7, for example. But while these are made to Apple's own design and specifications, several other companies are involved: they contain technology licensed from ARM, and are manufactured, at present, by Samsung and TSMC. But that could change by the time 2018 comes around. Intel has declared its intention of expanding its smartphone business, and is hot favourite to displace TSMC from the iPhone contract, according to the Nikkei Asian Review - an aim that may be more feasible thanks to the company's recently announced partnership with ARM. TSMC's ties with ARM have given it a competitive edge when it comes to securing the contract in the past. "Intel is definitely the most formidable challenger for TSMC," said an anonymous chip-industry executive. "There is no rivalry between Apple and Intel so it's really likely that Apple could shift some orders there. The move is also in line with Washington's policy to encourage US companies to make more products at home." iPhone 8 specs: Camera The iPhone is one of the most widely used cameras in the world. What's in store for this vital element of the iPhone of the future? Lucky iPhone owners of the future may get their hands on a feature currently offered only by premium video cameras. In March 2015 Apple was granted a patent for a "digital camera with light splitter". Its project is to create a light splitter system (which for now exists only in high-end video camera) small enough to fit in an iPhone. In essence, a light splitter system consists of a cube that splits received light into three colours: red, green and blue. The cube provides three image sensors, each of which receives one colour component. In recent iPhones, the camera system is such that its pixels capture the three component colours which end up occupying only a single image sensor; this means that they can fill only one third of the image sensor and colours are not as accurate as they could be. The light splitter system would be a big coup for Apple. Its iPhone would be able to capture high-quality pictures with more precise colours, especially at night. Apple seems to be keen to improve the camera capabilities of its iOS devices, and one patent published by USPTO in May 2014 suggests we could soon see iPhones that are able to capture "Super-resolution" photos thanks to optical image stabilisation, which is already a feature of the iPhone 6 Plus. The patent describes a system that takes a series of photographs at slightly different angles and stitches them together to create a 'super resolution' photograph. Apple doesn't suggest a device would capture every photo this way. Instead, the user would have the option to turn super-resolution mode on, much like HDR and Panorama modes. Several rumours suggest that Apple plans to introduce a feature like this with an iPhone in the near future, with reports pointing to a 'DSLR-quality' capability that would represent the biggest camera jump in iPhone upgrade history. iPhone 8 specs: Battery life One rumour holds that Apple will take the battery developments it deployed in the 12-inch MacBook - whereby contoured, layered battery units are stacked inside the chassis in order to take up every possible inch of space - and use these to squeeze more battery volume inside the iPhone. (According to Wired's write-up, Apple actually claims to adjust its battery contours on a machine-by-machine basis, by photographing the inside of the chassis and modifying the battery stack to fit all the tiny imperfections - which, if it's true, is amazing.) Smartphone battery life is one of those things that everyone says is important, and once again Apple will hear many requests for improved battery life in the iPhone 8 - but you do wonder how much of a compromise the average Apple fan would be willing to make in return. What if, in order to achieve a superb battery life, the iPhone 8 was twice the weight, or cost significantly more? What if the screen was less powerful or the processor scaled back? Mirroring these thoughts somewhat, Jony Ive discussed battery life briefly in an interview with the Financial Times' 'How to spend it' supplement recently. And he gave fairly heavy hints that Apple doesn't think battery life is a high enough priority to make compromises in other areas worth it. "Talking of performance, when the issue of the frequent need to recharge the iPhone is raised, [Ive] answers that it's because it's so light and thin that we use it so much and therefore deplete the battery. With a bigger battery it would be heavier, more cumbersome, less 'compelling'." In December 2015 Apple gave its critics an early Christmas present by unveiling a battery pack for the iPhone 6 and 6s that is, without wishing to be unpleasant and apologies for the language, pretty gosh-darn ugly. (To be fair, we've not yet got our hands on a review sample, so we may be won over by its feel, performance, usability and so on.) In a single surprising step the company put its famed sense of taste and design nous in doubt (coming after the suspect decision to put the charge port for the Magic Mouse 2 on its bottom), and simultaneously reminded everyone that iPhone battery life is generally felt to be subpar. Is this a tacit acknowledgement that battery life is a problem for the iPhone range? Can we therefore expect the iPhone 8 to see improvements in this department as Apple looks for a more full-time and less bulky solution to the issue? We might (battery technology is improving all the time), but this probably isn't the mea culpa some iPhone users were looking for. When discussing the new case, Tim Cook emphasised that it wasn't for everyone (at £80 you'd hope not), and that he felt that even those who did need the case would only use it in relatively extreme scenarios when power wouldn't be available for a long time: when hiking, for example. I would agree that Apple is aware that battery life is a concern for a lot of its customers, but it knew that long before it released its battery pack. And battery life remains a question of compromises, such that increasing it always necessitates either making a device thicker, heavier or more expensive, or choosing not to make it thinner, lighter or cheaper when you could have done. I still believe that most people would rather have a thin, relatively cheap iPhone than a fat, more expensive iPhone with an extra two hours of battery life. And now anyone who would be willing to make that compromise now has an officially sanctioned alternative: spend the extra money, make your phone fatter and uglier, and get the battery pack. In a crazy sort of way, the ugliness of the battery pack almost makes sense as a demonstration of what drastically improved battery life actually looks like. "You want twice the battery life? Even if that means your iPhone has a massive lump on the back? Yeah, DIDN'T THINK SO." iPhone 8 specs: LiFi A boring but important rumour about the iPhone 8's specs relates to LiFi, a new wireless standard that boasts 100x faster download speeds than conventional WiFi connections. LiFi uses visible light communication (VLC) instead of radio waves like conventional WiFi routers. Intrigued?

Cook earned $8.75 million in 2016, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing from Apple on Friday. That compares with $10.28 million in 2015, and $9.22 million in 2014. The Cupertino, California-based company had aimed to surpass its $223.6 billion in sales from 2015. Instead it fell short in 2016, raking in $215.6 billion. Because of the dip, Apple executives, including Cook, received only 89.5 percent of their annual cash incentives. For 2016, Cook's total compensation included $5.37 million in cash incentive pay, compared with $8 million in 2015 and $6.7 million in 2014. His base salary increased, though, from $2 million in 2015 to $3 million last year. Apple struggled with iPhone sales in 2016 -- the first time its flagship phone saw shipment declines. The company makes more than two-thirds of its revenue from the iPhone, so the device's drop put a dent in Apple's revenue. Apple did not respond to requests for comment. Meanwhile, the company is playing up its App Store sales boost, with its highest revenue ever in 2016, according to the filing. The momentum continues to roll into 2017. New Year's Day was its biggest sales day ever.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software iOS 10 Install Base Crosses the 76% Mark on Active Devices By Uzair Ghani Posted Jan 6, 2017 9Shares Share Tweet Submit iOS 10 is now currently installed on 76% of total active iPhone, iPad, iPod touch devices across the globe. iOS 10 is Slowly and Gradually Climbing on Top of the Hill iOS 10 made its big debut late last year, and managed to garner a respectable adoption rate. So much so in fact that the mobile OS from Cupertino is currently seeing itself being installed on 76% of active iOS devices worldwide. That’s a crazy number when you come to realize that last year’s OS – iOS 9 – is sitting at 18% out of the total pie, at the time of writing. The leftover 6% is occupied by older versions of iOS. This data was revealed by Apple itself on the App Store support page. The data portrayed was updated on January 4th, 2017. It’s amazing how quickly iOS 10 is seeing itself being adopted by users around the globe. While the adoption did slow down in between, but thankfully, Apple managed to give things a mighty boost by releasing a couple of important updates. For instance, iOS 10.1 was a big update for iPhone 7 Plus users as it introduced Portrait mode. Apart from that, Apple pushed things even further by releasing iOS 10.2, which introduced new wallpapers as well as a handful of new emoji characters. Advertisement At the time of writing, iOS 10.2.1 is currently in beta, and Apple is rumored to release iOS 10.3 to developers next week. The latter will supposedly introduce a new feature to iOS called ‘Theater Mode.’ At this point, it’s anyone’s guess what said feature will do. Either it’ll introduce the much-awaited night mode, or it might aid in silencing our phones for the better when we are sitting in a theater watching a movie. Whatever the case might be, we will be covering the update in detail. Master iOS 10 and Swift 3 with the Complete iOS 10 Developer Course Apple will, obviously, keep on releasing updates to iOS 10 until the next big thing, iOS 11, is released to public later this year. While things may look great for users, but iOS 10 requires quite a bit of polish, especially in the battery department. Despite adding performance related refinements, users have been constantly complaining about bad battery life from the get-go. Let’s just hope Apple fixes things up sooner rather than later.

As the Irish Times reports, the Irish parliament's finance committee had invited the executive to talk after a ruling by the European Commission that Apple's tax arrangements in Ireland amount to illegal "state aid," and that it owes €13 billion (£11 billion, or $13.8 billion) in taxes. Both Ireland and Apple deny any wrongdoing. In a letter, Apple senior director of government affairs Claire Thwaites declined the invitation to the company's CEO, describing the matter as "complex and challenging" and citing ongoing legal counsel. "Given the sensitive nature of the investigation and the timing, we have been advised not to undertake any other direct activities, which could potentially prejudice future outcomes. It is on this basis that we are unable to appear before the Committee on this occasion," she wrote. (You can read the full letter below.) It's a decision that has infuriated some. Pearse Doherty, finance spokesperson for Sinn Féin, said in a statement: "Tim Cook appeared before the US Senate hearings and it was his comments there that sparked much of the discussion and possibly even EU action in this case. For him to refuse to attend the Committee now is disrespectful to the Irish people." Both Apple and Ireland are appealing the August 2016 tax ruling from the European Commission, which could see it forced to pay €13 billion in what the Commission believes are unpaid taxes. Apple said that "the most profound and harmful effect of this ruling will be on investment and job creation in Europe." Meanwhile, Ireland argues that the Commission overstepped its mandate, and breached the country's sovereignty. "The Commission breached the duty of good administration by failing to act impartially and in accordance with its duty of care," it said. While the tax ruling would be a short-term windfall for the country, its fear is that long-term, it would scare away other multinational that would otherwise be attracted by its appealing tax structure. Apple's refusal letter is being made public now, though it was sent on December 20, 2016, in response to an invite sent on December 15. Had Cook agreed to appear, he would have spoken to the committee on February 5, 2017.Here's the full letter: Dear Ms Dunne, I refer to your letter of December 15, 2016, and the invitation by the Chairman to Tim Cook, to appear before the Joint Committee on Finance & Public Expenditure on February 2, 2017. As outlined in the letter, the Committee wishes to engage with us on the State Aid investigation involving Apple in Ireland, published by the European Commission on 30 August 2016. As you will be aware The Irish Government has submitted their Appeal against the Final Decision to the General Court. Apple has also filed its Appeal. As you will appreciate, this is a complex and challenging issue, and one on which we are receiving ongoing legal counsel. We are engaging with the Department of Finance and The Revenue Commissions, as well as the European Commission. Given the sensitive nature of the investigation and the timing, we have been advised not to undertake any other direct activities, which could potentially prejudice future outcomes. It is on this basis that we are unable to appear before the Committee on this occasion.

We don't know just how many devices Google has shifted, but the reviews have been largely positive, and the move seems to have been a success. Now Google has made a clean break, it's in brand new territory - so what will it do with the Pixel 2 in 2017? The story so far© Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. The very first Pixel has only been with us since October 2016, but the way Google handled the Nexus range of phones might give us some clues about what the future holds. From the Nexus One to the Nexus 6P, the flagship stock Android handsets were released in January 2010, December 2010, October 2011, November 2012, October 2013, November 2014 and September 2015, with the Pixel and Pixel XL then appearing in October 2016. There's obviously a pattern there of an autumn release and it would be a surprise if the Pixels didn't follow that - even more of a surprise considering the likes of Apple, Samsung and Google's other rivals are locked into yearly release cycles at this stage. The Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 are likely to be with us in October 2017 then, and Google may well stick with HTC as its uncredited hardware partner - that is if it still needs a hardware partner this time around. If Google is relying less on someone else to make the phone, and bringing more of the hardware process in house, it may be able to launch the Pixel 2 even sooner. How many Pixels will there be?© Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. We've now used to Apple launching a smaller and a larger handset every September, and it makes sense to cater to as wide a group of people as possible, with two different screen sizes and two different starting price points every year. That was probably Google's thinking last October and there's no real reason why it would deviate from it in 2017. Both Pixels are pretty much identical, except for the screen size, screen resolution and battery capacity - unlike the iPhones, there's no variation in the camera configuration. Of course Apple has the iPhone SE as a third option - but that kind of nostalgic blast from the past is unlikely to be an option Google's going to take anytime soon. In fact we don't think there's going to be a third phone of any size, and we'd be very surprised if Google didn't stick to the Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 in October. Don't forget Google already has a Pixel C tablet, which may well get an update of its own at some point during 2017, so it has the larger screen covered. Google Pixel 2: rumours and speculation© Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. It's been quiet on the Pixel 2 rumour front so far - very quiet - so we can only assume Google runs a tight ship as far as smartphone leaks go. News of the original Pixel did trickle out a few months ahead of time, but there wasn't quite the same level of speculation as we're used to for the Apple iPhone. There is one rumour of note worth mentioning that concerns the last Pixel: that HTC replaced Huawei as Google's hardware partner late in the day, just nine months before the phone was due to be released. If Google has a longer run up this time around then we can expect a handset that's even more polished and desirable - perhaps we'll get those optional extras like waterproofing and wireless charging that were missing from the 2016 Pixel phones. No doubt we'll start to hear more about what the Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 have in store for us as the year progresses, but don't hold your breath for anything revolutionary - as Google Assistant shows, the biggest innovations may well be on the software side. Google Pixel 2: what we're expecting© Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. The Snapdragon 835 already looks set to be the go-to mobile CPU of choice during 2017, and it's a good bet that it's going to find its way into Google's Pixel phones too, bringing better performance alongside less drain on the battery. Elsewhere there are likely to be minor improvements: the 4GB of RAM might get bumped to 6GB, and the smaller phone might get an upgrade to the 2,560 x 1,440 QHD resolution sported by the larger one, though it makes less of a difference on a 5-inch screen. Much was made of the camera on board the Pixel and Pixel XL last year, and Google will probably want to focus on this again in 2017 - there might even be room for a dual-lens approach, to follow Apple's lead, and perhaps optical image stabilisation too. Don't forget the virtual reality angle either. There might not be a new Daydream View headset in 2017, but the new Pixels will definitely be built to be compatible with it, and any spec bumps will be made with VR in mind.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

A newly discovered video, posted to YouTube by independent tech journalist Sonny Dickson, shows an iPhone running an iPod-like precursor to the iOS operating system, dubbed Acorn. In the prototype, the iPhone was controlled by a virtual "click wheel" in the bottom half of the screen, not the familiar touch-button apps we know today. The prototype had a menu display in the top half, just like early version of the iPod, and a black strip in the middle with buttons for rewind, menu, play/pause and fast forward. The Acorn software was entirely text-based, with options for "favorites," "recents," "dial" and "SMS," in addition to all the menu items familiar to iPod users at the time. Though the video doesn't show a call being placed, it gives us a peek at a dialer that probably would have driven iPhone owners insane. It appears as though people would have had to dial numbers like on an old rotary phone. God help them if they wanted to type a text message. "You can see why we ditched it?" iPod designer and former Apple executive Tony Fadell tweeted Friday morning. The click-wheel iPhone has long been legend. Steve Jobs biographer Walter Isaacson wrote that Apple's engineers weren't sure customers would be able to master a smartphone with a touchscreen, so they pursued an alternate operating system controlled by a click wheel. Until Friday, a patent filed in 2006 was our only glimpse at what a click-wheel iPhone could have looked like. It turns out the patent drawings were very similar to the prototype revealed on Friday. Early prototypes for the iPhone are rarely seen: Apple famously destroys its rejected designs to avoid leaks. But we've been treated to a few glimpses into Apple engineers' thinking about how the first iPhone should have been designed. A patent dispute with Samsung in 2012 made public several early versions of the iPhone's hardware, including some truly odd shapes and sizes. According to Isaacson's biography, Apple's engineers got fully behind the touchscreen concept because they could not figure out how to dial and text using a click wheel. The touchscreen iPhone we're all familiar with ultimately debuted in 2007. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple and serves on its Board of Directors. Before being named CEO in August 2011, Tim was Apple's Chief Operating Officer and was responsible for all of the company's worldwide sales and operations. By Matt Egan NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Apple's sales slump is taking a bite out of Tim Cook's paycheck. The iPhone maker cut Cook's pay by 15% last year to $8.7 million, according to a filing released on Friday. Apple specifically cited the company's failure to meet its performance goals for both sales and profits. Shrinking iPhone sales last year caused Apple to suffer its first annual revenue decline in 15 years. Now Apple's board is holding its CEO and other leaders accountable for the stumbles. While Cook's salary rose to $3 million from $2 million last year, his cash bonus took a hit. Apple awarded Cook and other executives 89.5% of their target, instead of the maximum amount like in recent years. That meant Cook's cash bonus fell to $5.4 million in 2016, down from $8 million the year before. All told, Cook's total compensation was $8.7 million last year, compared with $10.3 million in 2015. But don't feel too bad for Cook, whose real fortune is linked to his vast holdings of Apple stock. Last year, Cook completed five years as CEO and nearly 1.3 million of his previously restricted Apple shares vested. The shares were worth about $136 million. As in previous years, Cook's 2016 pay was below that of his top lieutenants. All five senior executives below him, whose salary is made public, made just under $23 million in 2016. That includes Luca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, as well as retail boss Angela Ahrendts. Apple's rare sales slump is directly linked to the loss of momentum for the iPhone, which generates the majority of the tech icon's sales. Sales of iPhones have declined in each of the past three quarters, slipping to 45.5 million in the September quarter. The problem is that Apple has faced steep competition from Samsung and other smartphone makes and the newest iPhones haven't featured enough upgrades to lure customers. Apple's stock ended 2016 with a healthy gain of 10%. That compares with a 13% gain for the Dow and 9.5% for the S&P 500. The popular stock received a boost in early September thanks to the Galaxy Note 7 disaster, which forced Samsung to discontinue the phone. Apple will reveal just how much it benefited from Samsung's pain when the company reports quarterly numbers on January 31. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple's Virtual Click Wheel Prototype feature for iOS may have been discovered | Main | Patent Troll GPNE continues to Fight Apple in China over Infringing Patents related to Cellular technologies » January 06, 2017 We weep to learn that Super Millionaire Tim Cook won't make as many Millions as last year   It's being reported today that Apple's CEO Tim Cook and other top leaders received less compensation in 2016 as the company missed its revenue and profit goals for the year: aw poor things.   As a result, company executives didn't get their full potential cash incentive. In each of the four preceding years, the executives got the maximum total payout amount. In all, Mr. Cook received $8.75 million in total 2016 compensation, down from $10.3 million in 2015. Other executives also received lower pay.   Mr. Cook's pay fell 15% last year versus a 9.6% average decline for Apple's other named executives, as cash incentives make up a larger percentage of his compensation. Pay for Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri fell 10% to $22.8 million, which includes about $20 million in stock awards.   But don't shed a tear dear Apple fans, as Apple's other top executives were granted additional bonuses this year in the $25 million dollar range. And  Apple's CEO received over $100 million in bonuses in August for simply reaching the five year mark as CEO.   According to a regulatory filing on Friday, Apple said its annual sales of $215.6 billion were 3.7% below its target of $223.6 billion, and its operating income of $60 billion was 0.5% short of the $60.3 billion target.

With the release of iOS 10 during WWDC 2016, Apple finally made SiriKit available to developers. There are still some restrictions on which types of applications can take advantage of Siri, but it's a step in the right direction. Let's take a look at what we can do with Siri. For more on SiriKit and the other new features for developers in iOS 10, check out Markus Mühlberger's course, right here on Envato Tuts+. iOS What's New in iOS 10 Markus Mühlberger Supported Domains To make use of SiriKit, your app has to be in one or more of the following domains: VoIP calling (for example, Skype) Messaging (WhatsApp) Payments (Square, PayPal) Photo (Photos) Workouts (Runtastic) Ride booking (Uber, Lyft) CarPlay (automotive vendors only) Restaurant reservations (requires additional support from Apple) If your app doesn't belong to any of these categories, unfortunately you cannot use Siri in your app at this moment. Don't leave just yet, though, because SiriKit is very powerful, and it may gain new capabilities in the future! Extension Architecture A SiriKit extension is in reality composed of two types of extension. An Intents extension is required and takes care of handling the requests by the user and executing a specific task in your app (such as starting a call, sending a message, etc.). On the other hand, an IntentsUI extension is not mandatory. You should only create one if you want to customize the user interface that Siri shows when presenting your data. If you don't do this, the standard Siri interface will be displayed. We are going to take a look at both types of extension in this tutorial. For your information, during WWDC 2016 Apple released two very interesting videos about SiriKit. You may want to check them out: Introducing SiriKit - Session 217 Extending Your Apps with SiriKit - Session 225 Example Project We are going to build a simple app that processes payments via Siri. The goal is to successfully process the sentence "Send $20 to Patrick via TutsplusPayments". The format of the sentence consists of an amount of money with a specific currency, the name of the payee, and the app to use to complete the transaction. We are later going to analyze the payment intent in more detail. Initial Setup Let's start by creating a standard Xcode project in Swift and giving it a name. There are a few mandatory steps that you have to do before writing any code to enable your app to use Siri's APIs. 1. Select your Target > Capabilities and enable the Siri capability. Make sure that the entitlements were created successfully in your project structure. 2. Open your app's Info.plist and add the key NSSiriUsageDescription. The value must be a string explaining your usage of Siri that will be shown to the user when asked for the initial permission. 3. Select File > New > Target. In the new window presented by Xcode, under Application Extensions, choose Intents Extension. Also select the option to include a UI Extension. This will save you from later having to create another separate extension. In the Info.plist file of your newly created Intents target, fully expand the NSExtension dictionary to study its contents. The dictionary describes in more detail which intents your extension supports and if you want to allow the user to invoke an intent while the device is locked.  Insert the most relevant intents at the top if you want to support more than one. Siri uses this order to figure out which one the user wants to use in case of ambiguity. We now need to define which intents we want to support. In this example, we are going to build an extension that supports the payment intent. Modify the Info.plist file to match the following picture. Here we specify that we want to handle the INSendPaymentIntent and that we require the device to be unlocked. We don't want strangers to send payments when the device is lost or stolen! iOS Target The next step actually involves writing some code in the iOS app. We have to ask the user for permission to send their voice to Apple for analysis. We simply have to import the Intents framework and call the appropriate method as follows: import UIKit
import Intents 

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
 	    super.viewDidLoad()
		// Ask permission to access Siri
		INPreferences.requestSiriAuthorization { authorizationStatus in
			switch authorizationStatus {
			case .authorized:
				 print("Authorized")
			default:
				print("Not Authorized")
			}
		}
	}
} The resulting dialog presented to the user during the first launch of the app will look like this. This is all we have to do in our simple iOS app. Let's get into the extensions world now! Intents Extension Switch to the Intents extension that we created earlier. Expand its contents in the Xcode project navigator. You'll see just one file named IntentHandler.swift. This file is the entry point of your extension and is used to handle any intents that Siri sends you. Siri will forward to the handler(for:) method all the intents in case your extension supports multiple types. It's your job to check the type of the INIntent object and handle it appropriately. The IntentHandler.swift template already contains an example implementation of a Messaging intent. Replace all the code with the following empty method so that we can walk together through each step. class IntentHandler: INExtension {
     
    override func handler(for intent: INIntent) -> Any? {
        // This is the default implementation.  If you want different objects to handle different intents,
        // you can override this and return the handler you want for that particular intent.         
        return self
    }
} Each intent has an associated protocol to make sure a class implements all the required methods. Most of the protocols in the Intents framework have the same structure. The protocol that we are going to implement is called INSendPaymentIntentHandling. This protocol contains the following required and optional methods: Required: handle(sendPayment:completion:)  Optional: confirm(sendPayment:completion:)  resolvePayee(forSendPayment:with:)  resolveCurrencyAmount(forSendPayment:with:)  resolveNote(forSendPayment:with:) Let's create an extension of the IntentHandler class in the same Swift file to implement the only required method. extension IntentHandler: INSendPaymentIntentHandling {
 
    func handle(sendPayment intent: INSendPaymentIntent, completion: @escaping (INSendPaymentIntentResponse) -> Void) {
        // Check that we have valid values for payee and currencyAmount
 	    guard let payee = intent.payee, let amount = intent.currencyAmount else {
            return completion(INSendPaymentIntentResponse(code: .unspecified, userActivity: nil))
        }
 	    // Make your payment!
 	    print("Sending \(amount) payment to \(payee)!")
        completion(INSendPaymentIntentResponse(code: .success, userActivity: nil))
    }
} This is a very basic implementation. We make sure there is a valid payee and currencyAmount to set the transaction as successful. You may not believe it, but it works already! Select the Intents scheme from Xcode and run it. When Xcode presents the usual menu to choose an app to run, select Siri. When Siri starts, try to say, "Send $20 to Patrick via TutsplusPayments". Now enjoy your first successful payment completed with your voice! You can also try to test the failing case. Try to say the same sentence as before but without specifying the payee (i.e: "Send $20 via TutsplusPayments"). You'll see that Siri will fail and present the user a button to continue the payment in your app. In case Siri does not understand or is not provided with one of the optional parameters but you require a valid value, you can implement one of the resolve methods. Those methods present the user an option to give more details about the payment such as the name of payee, the exact currency amount, and even a note. With this smart architecture of the API, you as developer are presented with the possibility to easily and clearly understand your user's request in different ways. In a real-world application, you would create a dynamic framework that is shared between your iOS app and extensions. By making use of this architecture, you can share the same business logic in multiple targets. You won't need to implement it multiple times, but just once and for all targets! Intents UI Extension In the last part of this tutorial, I am going to show you how you can customize the user interface that Siri displays. First of all, remember to set the correct intent class that you want to handle in the Info.plist of the ExtensionUI, as we did in the previous section. Jump into the Intents UI extension and you'll see the template that Xcode has created for you. It contains an IntentViewController, which is a simple subclass of UIViewController that implements the INUIHostedViewControlling protocol. A Storyboard file was also created for you; open it so that we can start customizing the user interface. Add a UIImageView as the background and a label in the center. Download the background image, import it into the Intents UI target, and set it as the image of the newly created UIImageView. Create a UILabel object and position it at the center of the view. You can easily use AutoLayout to set up the constraints in Storyboard. Open the Assistant Editor and create an @IBOutlet for your label and call it contentLabel. The result should look like something like this: Open the IntentViewController file and you'll see a bunch of example code. You can remove everything except the configure(with:context:completion:) method that we are going to implement now. This method is called when the user interface is ready to be configured. What we have to do here is set the content of the UILabel. class IntentViewController: UIViewController, INUIHostedViewControlling {
     
    @IBOutlet weak var contentLabel: UILabel!
     
    // MARK: - INUIHostedViewControlling
 
    func configure(with interaction: INInteraction!, context: INUIHostedViewContext, completion: ((CGSize) -> Void)!) {
 
        if let paymentIntent = interaction.intent as? INSendPaymentIntent {
            // If any of this properties is not set, use the default UI.
            guard let amount = paymentIntent.currencyAmount?.amount, let currency = paymentIntent.currencyAmount?.currencyCode, let name = paymentIntent.payee?.displayName else {
                return completion(CGSize.zero)
            }
            let paymentDescription = "\(amount)\(currency) to \(name)"
            contentLabel.text = paymentDescription
        }
        if let completion = completion {
            completion(self.desiredSize)
        }
    }
     
    var desiredSize: CGSize {
        return self.extensionContext!.hostedViewMaximumAllowedSize
    }
} First of all, we check that the intent object is of type INSendPaymentIntent. If it is, we also make sure that all the properties that we want to display are not nil, otherwise we simply call the completion block with a size of zero to hide our custom view. If everything goes as we expect, we create a custom string with the data that we want to show to the user and set it as the text of the contentLabel. Run the extension again and you'll see the new view inside Siri! Siri still shows the default view. We can hide it by making our view controller conform to the INUIHostedViewSiriProviding protocol. class IntentViewController: UIViewController, INUIHostedViewControlling, INUIHostedViewSiriProviding {
    // Previous code goes here...
    var displaysPaymentTransaction: Bool {
        return true
    }
} By returning true in the displaysPaymentTransaction variable, we tell Siri that our view controller is taking care of displaying all the necessary information to the user and that the default view can be hidden. The result is much cleaner now! Note: As you can see in this picture, when specifying a different currency than US dollars, Siri correctly understands and returns the currency code to the extension. Unfortunately, the text always displays US dollars. I have reported this bug to Apple! Conclusion I hope you have enjoyed this tutorial. Siri is very powerful even if limited to some types of applications at the moment. If you plan to implement it in your own apps, make sure to market it well to your users because they may not be aware of how cool and advanced your app has become!

A newly discovered video, posted to YouTube by independent tech journalist Sonny Dickson, shows an iPhone running an iPod-like precursor to the iOS operating system, dubbed Acorn. In the prototype, the iPhone was controlled by a virtual “click wheel” in the bottom half of the screen, not the familiar touch-button apps we know today. The prototype had a menu display in the top half, just like early version of the iPod, and a black strip in the middle with buttons for rewind, menu, play/pause and fast forward. The Acorn software was entirely text-based, with options for “favorites,” “recents,” “dial” and “SMS,” in addition to all the menu items familiar to iPod users at the time. Though the video doesn’t show a call being placed, it gives us a peek at a dialer that probably would have driven iPhone owners insane. It appears as though people would have had to dial numbers like on an old rotary phone. God help them if they wanted to type a text message. “You can see why we ditched it?” iPod designer and former Apple executive Tony Fadell tweeted Friday morning. The click-wheel iPhone has long been legend. Steve Jobs biographer Walter Isaacson wrote that Apple’s engineers weren’t sure customers would be able to master a smartphone with a touchscreen, so they pursued an alternate operating system controlled by a click wheel. Until Friday, a patent filed in 2006 was our only glimpse at what a click-wheel iPhone could have looked like. It turns out the patent drawings were very similar to the prototype revealed on Friday. Early prototypes for the iPhone are rarely seen: Apple famously destroys its rejected designs to avoid leaks. But we’ve been treated to a few glimpses into Apple engineers’ thinking about how the first iPhone should have been designed. A patent dispute with Samsung in 2012 made public several early versions of the iPhone’s hardware, including some truly odd shapes and sizes. According to Isaacson’s biography, Apple’s engineers got fully behind the touchscreen concept because they could not figure out how to dial and text using a click wheel. The touchscreen iPhone we’re all familiar with ultimately debuted in 2007.

Apple (AAPL, Tech30) specifically cited the company's failure to meet its performance goals for both sales and profits. Shrinking iPhone sales last year caused Apple to suffer its first annual revenue decline in 15 years. Now Apple's board is holding its CEO and other leaders accountable for the stumbles. While Cook's salary rose to $3 million from $2 million last year, his cash bonus took a hit. Apple awarded Cook and other executives 89.5% of their target, instead of the maximum amount like in recent years. That meant Cook's cash bonus fell to $5.4 million in 2016, down from $8 million the year before. All told, Cook's total compensation was $8.7 million last year, compared with $10.3 million in 2015. Related: Apple is setting up shop in Samsung territory But don't feel too bad for Cook, whose real fortune is linked to his vast holdings of Apple stock. Last year, Cook completed five years as CEO and nearly 1.3 million of his previously restricted Apple shares vested. The shares were worth about $136 million. As in previous years, Cook's 2016 pay was below that of his top lieutenants. All five senior executives below him, whose salary is made public, made just under $23 million in 2016. That includes Luca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, as well as retail boss Angela Ahrendts. Apple's rare sales slump is directly linked to the loss of momentum for the iPhone, which generates the majority of the tech icon's sales. Sales of iPhones have declined in each of the past three quarters, slipping to 45.5 million in the September quarter. The problem is that Apple has faced steep competition from Samsung and other smartphone makes and the newest iPhones haven't featured enough upgrades to lure customers. Apple's stock ended 2016 with a healthy gain of 10%. That compares with a 13% gain for the Dow and 9.5% for the S&P 500. The popular stock received a boost in early September thanks to the Galaxy Note 7 disaster, which forced Samsung to discontinue the phone. Apple will reveal just how much it benefited from Samsung's pain when the company reports quarterly numbers on January 31.

Ben Lovejoy - Jan. 6th 2017 7:44 am PT @benlovejoy Feature Mac View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit As we move into the new year, we’re taking a look in a series of pieces at what the future might hold for Apple’s product line-up, for this year and beyond. Jordan kicked things off with an overview, and a closer look at the iPhone 8, while I’m turning my attention to the Mac. In the longer-term, there are bigger questions we can ask about the future of the Mac – the biggest of all being: does it have one? While Tim Cook has sought to reassure us that Apple still loves the Mac despite making the vast bulk of its revenue from iOS devices, the company’s upgrade cycles do seem to suggest that computers are no longer the priority they once were. We had to wait four years for a meaningful upgrade to the MacBook Pro – though not all professional users consider it an upgrade. The flagship Mac Pro has gone more than three years without an update, the Mac mini more than two years, and the iMac over a year. The MacBook Air is coming up for two years without an update, and probably won’t get one as the MacBook lines up to take its place … Apple has increasingly been positioning the iPad Pro as a replacement for a laptop. The company has dropped out of the display business, and there are rumors it will do the same with routers. The Mac ecosystem appears to be crumbling. And while we’ve heard plenty of rumors about what sounds like an exciting upgrade to the iPhone this year, the rumor-mill for the Mac has been decidedly quiet and discouraging. So what can we realistically expect this year – and what might the longer-term future hold? While the news may appear depressing, Macs remain a $22B business for Apple. They are going to be around for some years to come. Let’s start by looking at what we might expect this year and next before we look at the longer-term prospects of the Mac. MacBook Pro The MacBook Pro of course just got a major upgrade, with a much sleeker design, all-USB-C ports, a stunning new display, super-fast SSD, Skylake processors, Radeon Pro GPUs, Touch Bar, Touch ID and more. Apple was forced to go with Skylake CPUs because suitable Kaby Lake versions weren’t available in time. It’s possible that Apple will refresh the MacBook Pro with Kaby Lake processors at some point this year, but I wouldn’t let this influence any purchase decisions, for two reasons. First, a rapid refresh with new processors would be poor PR for Apple – leaving existing purchasers annoyed that their expensive new machine has already been superceded. Second, because Kaby Lake specs aren’t very impressive, offering little performance gain over Skylake. Depending on how well Intel has managed to optimize performance, the one real-life benefit we may see is improved battery-life. Nor is a Kaby Lake refresh likely to see any change to the maximum 16GB RAM. This will disappoint those using their MacBook Pro to run virtual machines, but for most other applications the super-fast SSD means that RAM is much less of an issue than it once was. Speaking of SSD, anyone hoping for a bump to capacities is also likely to be disappointed. Apple has never been noted for its generosity with storage, and the PCIe/NVMe SSD Apple uses in the 2016 MacBook Pro is frighteningly expensive, so offering higher capacities for the same price would hit Apple’s margins hard. Couple this to the company pushing iCloud as the future of storage and I’d expect SSD capacities to remain unchanged. Some have speculated that we may see a price cut at some point this year, as happened with the Retina models and the 5K iMac, but with all the shiny new tech, I again wouldn’t hold my breath for this. In short, if you’re waiting to buy a MacBook Pro, you might as well do so now.   MacBook Air Apple’s current Mac line-up is messy. The MacBook is more expensive than the Air but less powerful. Instead of having a simple choice between a lower-spec/cheaper/lighter and higher-spec/more expensive/heavier range, customers are faced with a more confusing choice where they have to trade off compromises. That’s very un-Apple-like. We’ve already seen Apple drop the 11-inch MacBook Air, and the smart money says that the 13-inch model is just hanging in there as a stop-gap until the company can make the 12-inch MacBook more affordable. Once it can, then it seems near-certain that the 13-inch MacBook Air will join its smaller brother in being consigned to history, and a lower-price 12-inch MacBook will be the new entry-level portable. If you specifically want the 13-inch MacBook Air, there doesn’t seem much pointing waiting for an upgrade – a possible minor refresh aside, it’s probably not going to happen. MacBook If the 12-inch MacBook does indeed replace the MacBook Air in the line-up, I can see two things happening. First, we’ll see an entry-level machine, probably in the $999-1099 range (I suspect the latter is more likely). That would allow Apple to continue to attract those buyers who really want a Mac but are constrained on budget – including the all-important student market. Get them hooked on Macs now, and their lifetime value to the company is huge. Second, the MacBook will continue to grow more powerful as fanless chips become more capable, but Apple needs to retain clear water between the MacBook and MacBook Pro ranges, so the machine will remain pitched at those with more basic needs. One big question-mark for me is whether the MacBook will get a Touch Bar. If the new UI takes off, seeing useful support from a wider range of apps, it could be argued that it should be available across the range. But my guess is that this will remain a premium feature that helps Apple maintain a clear distinction between its ultraportable and professional machines. Given its launch in April 2015 and a new model in April 2016, an update in April 2017 seems at least plausible – though one rumor suggests it will be a minor one. Whether Apple could make a low-end model hit a $999-1099 price target by then is less certain – that might need to wait until either the fall or next year. iMac The iMac got a big upgrade in 2014, with a Retina 5K display, completing the job just over a year ago when the 5K display was extended across the 27-inch range and the smaller 21.5-inch iMac was upgraded to a 4K screen. Impressive as those upgrades were, however, the iMac is definitely due a new model this year. Sadly, the rumor reported by Bloomberg is for a relatively minor update this year: ‘USB-C ports and a new AMD GPU.’ That said, given that the switch to USB-C is turning out to be painless for most, it would make sense to wait for the new machine so that you have a more future-proof model. At some point, though, I can see a new design on the cards. While the core design of the iMac is a classic that looks as great today as it did when first launched, the slim casing we always see in marketing photos is an optical illusion: thin at the edges, fatter in the middle. Given Apple’s obsession with ultra-thin design, I can feel Jony Ive itching to slim down the iMac. The bad news is that I suspect that may see iMacs take the same approach as MacBooks: soldered RAM and SSDs. The end of the upgradable iMac is, I fear, in sight. If you want to retain the ability to perform DIY upgrades, the next model may be the one to buy before a full redesign. Mac Pro The Mac Pro is another area where Apple’s line-up is in a bit of a mess. The point of a top-of-the-range Mac – the whole point of it – is that it offers audiovisual pros the maximum possible performance. That means it’s vital to keep updating the machine so that it retains this crown. The Mac Pro is now more than three years old, and has already (in admittedly limited ways) been out-performed by the top-end MacBook Pro. If the Mac Pro doesn’t represent the pinnacle of performance in the Mac world (and ideally beyond it), why exactly does it exist? Apple of course doesn’t comment on possible future developments, but it hasn’t even confirmed that the Mac Pro has a future. Any pro looking for a top-spec machine today is faced with the prospect of paying a great deal of money for a three-year-old spec with one of two unappetising prospects: either it will quickly be superseded by a new model or they are buying into a dead-end platform. There is, perhaps, one slight clue – and it’s not an encouraging one. Given that all expansion of the Mac Pro is external anyway, and given the way that Apple has been playing-up the ability of the 15-inch MacBook Pro to drive up to four 4K monitors, it seems at least possible that the company is positioning the maxed-out MacBook Pro to take over the role once held by the desktop machine. Unless you really need this machine, wait-and-see would be the only sane approach for now. Mac mini I’m a little surprised that the Mac mini still exists. Its original role was to encourage owners of Windows desktop PCs to make the switch to Mac. The thinking was that they already have a keyboard, monitor and mouse, so if you can allow them to replace only the system unit – at an affordable price – it removes a major barrier to switching. Today, desktop PCs are very much a niche market. That original rationale no longer makes much sense, yet Apple continues to sell its ultra-compact desktop machine. The Mac mini does have a very enthusiastic fan-base, but my impression is that it’s largely a rather niche techy one. Using the machine as a home media server seems to be a popular application. However, with a starting-price of just $499, the mini does still provide the most affordable entry into the Mac world, and this may be the secret to its continued survival. Even if all the machine mostly does is bring people in through the door in order to upsell them to something else, that would justify its existence. Either way, though, I wouldn’t hold out much hope of a major update. It definitely needs something, after more than two years, but I can’t see Apple viewing the machine as much of a priority. If you want an indication of the esteem in which Apple holds the machine, its website is still picturing it with a display the company no longer makes … Apple Display Apple’s apparent decision to quit the display business and instead recommend LG products hasn’t been well-received. While I can understand the company viewing desktops as a niche market, and displays as an area where it can perhaps add less value, the fact remains that many of us were disappointed by the move and unimpressed by LG’s UltraFine. I’m not expecting Apple to make a U-turn on this one, but I’m certainly hoping it will. Longer term I said at the beginning that the biggest long-term question of all is whether the Mac has a long-term future? Apple has for many years been a phone company that also makes computers, and the continued trend is for first desktops and then laptops to be increasingly replaced by mobile devices. But I think any talk of Apple pulling out of the computer market altogether is very much premature. Macs are a profitable product line, and a key part of the Apple ecosystem that boosts the appeal of its mobile products. We also shouldn’t underestimate the brand value of walking into a coffee shop and seeing a sea of MacBooks. I also think talk of mobile and desktop devices merging into a single product line is too soon. Steve Jobs was absolutely right in arguing that computers are trucks and most people just need cars, but trucks still perform a necessary role for a significant chunk of the market. Macs are going to remain distinct products for quite some time yet. But we are undoubtedly going to see ever-closer integration with iOS devices. I’d expect to see more Continuity features, and more cross-platform ones, functionality mirrored as closely as possible between macOS and iOS. ARM-based Macs It also seems likely that we’ll at some point see ARM-based Macs. Switching to its own CPU designs would finally free Apple from Intel’s product cycles, allowing it to make its own decisions on when to upgrade. A change in architecture would not be a step Apple would take lightly: it would require apps to be converted, and native Windows compatibility would also be a problem. But Apple has made this kind of transition twice before, once from the Motorola 68000 architecture of the original Macintosh range to the PowerPC in 1994, and again from PPC to Intel in 2006. ARM processors are already starting to rival low-end Intel ones for power, both in theory and in real-life use. However, maintaining full compatibility would mean an ARM-based processor having enough power to emulate an Intel one – a much tougher goal. All the same, I’d say it’s a question of ‘when’ rather than ‘if.’ The 12-inch MacBook would be the obvious place for this transition to begin. A wireless future With Apple going all-in on USB-C in its latest machines, we’re unlikely to see any major port changes during the next few years, though I do suspect Apple will quietly drop the headphone socket from Macs as wireless headphones become the norm. It’s clear that the company’s long-term vision is of a completely wireless future, with documents mostly stored in the cloud rather than locally, but that’s a long way off right now. Dynamic keyboards We’ve already seen Apple switch from physical function keys to the Touch Bar in the new MacBook Pro, and Apple has been in discussions with e-ink keyboard manufacturer Sonder. A move to a fully-dynamic keyboard seems inevitable at some point. It’s even been speculated that Apple will eventually move to an all-glass keyboard – effectively something like an iPad screen taking the place of a physical keyboard. The big barrier to that, of course, is that it would be useless for touch-typing with no way to feel the keys. You’d also need a way to rest your fingers on the keys without activating them. But these are not necessarily insurmountable problems. Jony Ive has already hinted that the Touch Bar is just the start, and Apple has patents for ways to generate glass keys you can feel.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney This was Apple's prototype for the iPhone by David Goldman   @DavidGoldmanCNN January 7, 2017: 4:05 PM ET The original iPhone almost looked like this An early prototype of the iPhone reveals how Apple considered making its iconic smartphone a lot more like the iPod. A newly discovered video, posted to YouTube by independent tech journalist Sonny Dickson, shows an iPhone running an iPod-like precursor to the iOS operating system, dubbed Acorn. In the prototype, the iPhone was controlled by a virtual "click wheel" in the bottom half of the screen, not the familiar touch-button apps we know today. The prototype had a menu display in the top half, just like early version of the iPod, and a black strip in the middle with buttons for rewind, menu, play/pause and fast forward. The Acorn software was entirely text-based, with options for "favorites," "recents," "dial" and "SMS," in addition to all the menu items familiar to iPod users at the time. Though the video doesn't show a call being placed, it gives us a peek at a dialer that probably would have driven iPhone owners insane. It appears as though people would have had to dial numbers like on an old rotary phone. God help them if they wanted to type a text message. "You can see why we ditched it?" iPod designer and former Apple executive Tony Fadell tweeted Friday morning. SW version of iPod+Phone for UI team. You can see why we ditched it? Apple's click wheel iPhone https://t.co/622WOH9WfI @Verge @jjvincent— Tony Fadell (@tfadell) January 6, 2017 The click-wheel iPhone has long been legend. Steve Jobs biographer Walter Isaacson wrote that Apple's engineers weren't sure customers would be able to master a smartphone with a touchscreen, so they pursued an alternate operating system controlled by a click wheel. Until Friday, a patent filed in 2006 was our only glimpse at what a click-wheel iPhone could have looked like. It turns out the patent drawings were very similar to the prototype revealed on Friday. Early prototypes for the iPhone are rarely seen: Apple famously destroys its rejected designs to avoid leaks. But we've been treated to a few glimpses into Apple engineers' thinking about how the first iPhone should have been designed. A patent dispute with Samsung in 2012 made public several early versions of the iPhone's hardware, including some truly odd shapes and sizes. According to Isaacson's biography, Apple's engineers got fully behind the touchscreen concept because they could not figure out how to dial and text using a click wheel. The touchscreen iPhone we're all familiar with ultimately debuted in 2007.

In a proxy statement filed today, Apple executives wrote: “Apple already provides detailed information about our core values and our most significant charitable contributions on our website at apple.com/diversity/creating-opportunities and apple.com/product-red.” The company then went on to list those contributions, some of which are well known and others less so: “Apple has joined President Obama’s ConnectED initiative and pledged $100 million to bring technology and services into 114 underserved schools across the United States. Under this program, we are donating an iPad to every student, a Mac and iPad to every teacher, and an Apple TV to every classroom, as well as services and professional development for teachers. There are now more than 50,000 students learning, creating, and exploring on iPad through our ConnectED commitment, and 96 percent of those students are eligible for a free or reduced-price lunch program.” “When our customers buy (PRODUCT)RED™ Apple products, Apple contributes to the Global Fund to provide counseling, testing, and medical care to those most affected by the AIDS epidemic. So far, (PRODUCT)RED has raised over $360 million for the Global Fund, including nearly $120 million through Apple.” Among the lesser known: “Apple has launched a multiyear, $40 million partnership with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. The TMCF in turn creates opportunities for students from public and private historically black colleges and universities who are pursuing careers in the tech industry. Apple does not just give money to the TMCF; we work collaboratively with the fund to advance its goals. For example, Apple hired 33 students from these institutions as summer interns in 2016, and as part of the TMCF partnership, also hosted them for a weeklong immersion at Apple’s campus several months ahead of time to provide them with a foundation of Apple culture and values to help pave the way for a successful experience.” And here is a list of organizations that have been recipients of Apple’s charitable giving: American Red Cross The Conservation Fund Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing Mercy Corps National Center for Women & Information Technology National Society of Black Engineers World Wildlife Fund “Apple believes in leaving the world better than we found it,” the company wrote. “We actively support our communities through philanthropic activities.” ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Apple chief executive Tim Cook saw his salary and bonus slide in the last financial year, but his income from the sale of shares jumped dramatically. Mr Cook was paid $8.75m (£7.1m) in salary and bonus in 2016, down from $10.3m the previous year. All Apple's named executives saw their salary and bonus payments fall after the company reported lower sales and income in the year to September. However, Mr Cook also received $136m from the sale of shares. The information is contained in a filing lodged with the US financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr Cook has been Apple chief executive since August 2011. As part of his contract, he was awarded shares in the company which could only be "vested" or sold at stipulated times. It is these which have now brought his overall earnings close to $145m. Missed targets Each of the other named executives including chief financial officer Luca Maestri and Angela Ahrendts, senior vice president of retail received nearly $23m in salary, down from about $25m in 2015. In its SEC filing Apple said it had produced strong financial results in 2016. "However, the two financial measures used to evaluate executive performance under our annual cash incentive program, net sales and operating income, declined from our record-breaking 2015 levels. "These results were below the target performance goals set by the Compensation Committee. As a result, the annual cash incentive payouts to our named executive officers were below target," it added. It said cutting the cash incentive payouts reflected "strong pay-for-performance alignment". In 2016 Apple reported net sales of $215.6bn, 7.7% lower than in 2015. Operating income came in at $60bn, 15.7% below the previous year. Mr Cook's base salary was $3m, and the annual base salary for each of the other named executive officers was $1m.

By George Avalos | gavalos@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: January 6, 2017 at 6:45 am | UPDATED: January 6, 2017 at 4:51 pm CUPERTINO — Apple CEO Tim Cook’s total pay was reduced in 2016 because of the company’s below-par performance, Apple said Friday in a regulatory filing. During the tech giant’s 2016 fiscal year, Cook’s total compensation was $8.7 million. That was about $1.6 million, or 14.9 percent, less than the $10.3 million he made in the prior year, the company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filing said. “Apple was below its target performance goals for both net sales and operating income, resulting in a payout of each named executive officer’s annual cash incentive at 89.5 percent of target,” the company said in the SEC documents. Revenue of $215.6 billion was 3.6 percent below the company’s goals, while operating profits of $60 billion fell short by 0.5 percent, the company said. Cupertino-based Apple also cut pay for several other executives. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri received $22.8 million in total compensation during 2016. That was down 10 percent from 2015. Angela Ahrendts, senior vice president for retail, landed $22.9 million in total pay in 2016. That was down 11.2 percent from the prior year. Reading this on your iPhone or iPad?

Eddy Cue, senior vice president in charge of internet software and services, received $22.8 million in total compensation during 2016, down 9 percent from 2015. Dan Riccio, Apple’s hardware engineering chief and a senior vice president, received $22.8 million in total compensation in 2016, down 8.8 percent from the prior year. Cook’s base salary actually rose 50 percent to $3 million in 2016 from $2 million in the prior year, but he suffered a decline in cash incentives. His compensation from the company’s “non-equity incentive plan” was slashed. Cook captured $5.4 million in cash incentives during 2016, down 32.3 percent from 2015. Cook didn’t receive any new awards of stock in 2016, the filing showed. Despite the reduced compensation in 2016, Cook and other top executives with Apple could harvest plenty of cash in the future if they sell the shares they previously received from the company in the form of stock options. During 2016, an estimated 1.26 million shares of Cook’s previously received Apple stock vested at a value of $136.1 million. None of the named executives exercised stock options by selling shares in 2016, the filing stated. “Annual cash incentives are based on the performance of Apple relative to pre-determined objectives for the year, and the performance of the individual executive,” Apple said in the filing. Despite the dour assessment of Apple’s performance indicated by the company’s filing, Tim Bajarin, principal analyst with Campbell-based Creative Strategies, said he believes the tech titan remains on solid footing. “Apple did fall short in some of its financial goals for 2016,” Bajarin said. “But with what we have seen for iPhone sales and what we expect from the iPhone 8, 2016 could be a one-off aberration.” Apple shares rose 1.1 percent Friday and closed at $117.91. “Because of the iPhone 8, I think that Apple’s revenue could be close to, or even get to, record territory in 2017,” Bajarin said.

With this move, the payment coordination body of the European banking industry has placed over 34 European countries at the center-stage of ‘mobile payments’. This scheme will not only spearhead adoption of instant mobile payments and transactions worldwide, but also push the major economies of the World to start regulating the unstructured and incomplete mobile payments legal framework. The 2012 statement by the Associate General Counsel of Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (BGFRS), United States, summarized the consumer regulations related to mobile payments that are still existent and followed in the US. Growing adoption of mobile payments and steps taken by other regulatory bodies of the world like EPC will certainly push USA to update its own regulatory and legal framework. According to a report by market intelligence firm International Data Corporation, the worldwide annual transactions volume of mobile payments is expected to cross US$ 1 trillion in 2020 from US$ 500 billion in 2015. It becomes an equally valuable question – who is filling this huge gap? The answer is spread across companies ranging from global tech giants like Google etc. to fintech companies like Paypal and other several startups. The adoption rate of products and services enabling mobile payments has been moderate and hence, it tends to raise questions on market traction and penetration in days to come. As stated earlier, the legal framework and operative guidelines from the regulatory authorities on mobile based payments have been absent until now – not anymore! Companies like Samsung, Apple and Google have patiently waited for this opportunity and have been slowly gathering mobile payments related patents. As the regulatory and legal framework takes shape and markets incline towards reliance on mobile payments, something long due will be set in motion too – patent licensing and infringement lawsuits. Patent Landscape – Major Players The patent landscape of mobile based payments should help in putting things into perspective. Fintech companies are ruling the patent realm. Visa and Mastercard dominate with over 300 worldwide patented inventions each. PayPal is expanding its digital presence by investing huge in acquiring promising startups. In 2015 alone, it bought four startups including Xoom Corp., a digital money transfer company for US$ 890 million and Paydiant, a mobile wallet company for US$ 280 million. With such acquisitions and strategic partnership with Mastercard since 2007, PayPal is clearly one of the strongest mobile payments contender. Non-fintech companies are swiftly catching up too, owing to their strong smartphone market presence. Apple is placed at 13th position with respect to number of inventions but 2nd when it comes to the total number of patent publications (issued patents and pending publications). Samsung appears as the strongest competitor with 86 inventions and is placed ahead of all tech players. It acquired LoopPay, a mobile payments startup in 2015 for US$ 250 million and immediately rolled out tap-n-pay feature with its Galaxy S6. With this, Samsung is taking on potential market capturers like Apple Pay, Google Pay and PayPal-Mastercard partnership. Figure 2 shows the geographic interests of the top 15 players with respect to the number of total patent publications. Besides USA, Korea is the key geography with impressive patent portfolios built by players like Bizmodeline, Samsung, LG and SK Telecom. The bubble map (figure 3) shows comparative standings of these top 15 players with respect to their patent portfolios. The horizontal spread i.e. ‘patent quality’ has been prepared using our proprietary ‘patent quality scoring’ tool. The vertical spread i.e. ‘geographic expanse of filing’ refers to the stretch of jurisdictions in which inventions have been filed as patent applications. The size of a bubble corresponds to the number of inventions of that company related to mobile payments. Concur IP’s ‘Patent Quality Scoring’ tool benchmarks individual inventions against each other in a patent collection based on the following parameters: forward citations, geographic filing stretch, issuance status, remaining life and IPC (International Patent Classification) codes based technical expanse. Apple is a clear overall winner with a small yet powerful patent portfolio. Among the fintech companies, First Data Corp. has the portfolio with highest quality score followed by Visa and Paypal. This is mostly because First data’s portfolio is fairly younger and heavily cited by other parties. Bizmodeline is mostly concentrated in S. Korea with major focus only on contactless payments. Since, fintech companies lack the in-house smartphone support, market speculations of their acquisition by any of the smartphone manufacturers like Apple and Samsung are imperative. Portfolios like Visa, Mastercard and Paypal are very lucrative for the surrounding companies. It isn’t too difficult to imagine how this bubble map would shape-up if any such acquisition happens. Payment Modes & Provisioning Let’s look at the enabling technologies and forms of mobile payments. Figure 4 shows the distribution of inventions among the payment modes and provisioning methods. Payment modes illustrate the underlying technologies used for mobile payments and provisioning refers to the payment tools. While most common payment modes use contactless techniques (such as NFC) and over-the-internet, SMS/ MMS/ USSD based transactions can be quite fast and handy. Payment modes which use interactive voice response (IVR) over a phone call and audio based are less popular, relatively non-intuitive and insecure. Audio based mode includes Near-Sound Transfer, Data-over-Voice, audio signature and acoustic coupling. Digital wallet based payments are most prolific both in prevalent products and patented inventions. A payment provisioning method can be implemented using several modes. For example, a wallet based payment can be made using any one of several modes, NFC being the most popular. Figure 5 illustrates the distribution of patented inventions for a) Payment Mode and b) Payment Provisioning among the top 15 assignees.  Security Solutions As mobile payments become mainstream and widespread, transactional security is vital. The four security technologies at the center-point of mobile payments are Tokenization, Secure Element, Trusted Execution Environment and Host Card Emulation. While these solutions take care of the infrastructural security, extra layers of security at different levels are needed to complement these solutions. Biometric provisions like Touch ID in Apple Pay, security PIN, one-time-passcode, point-to-point encryption, 3D secure are some of the popular ones. Let’s briefly discuss the top four technologies to better relate to the patenting trends of the top players among these candidates. Tokenization: Protecting sensitive financial information such as card number by replacing it with unique and virtual credentials called ‘tokens’. Visa leads with 355 patent publications (66 inventions) related to ‘tokenization’. Secure Element: A tamper-resistant chip or a SIM/ UICC card resident on the mobile phone that emulates a contactless card. Mastercard leads with 147 patent publications (35 inventions) related to ‘secure element’. Host Card Emulation (HCE): Unlike ‘secure element’, a payment card is emulated using either only software or cloud environment. Visa leads with 42 patent publications (4 inventions) related to HCE. Trusted Execution Environment (TEE): A secure portion of the mobile phone processor that offers end-to-end safe execution of ‘trusted’ applications by enforcing protection, confidentiality, integrity and data access rights. Visa leads with 42 patent publications (12 inventions) related to TEE. Conclusion According to a BCG report a whopping 3 billion users will rely on accessing internet-based services on mobile by 2020. This is a huge market and mobile based payments is undoubtedly the future of digital money transfer, commerce and banking. Looking at the distribution of technology and patents, the power lies mostly divided between fintech and non-fintech companies. Hence, mergers and acquisitions will become more prominent in times to come and so will patent infringement lawsuits. When chip giant Qualcomm announced to acquire NFC pioneer NXP Semiconductors for US$ 47 billion earlier in 2016, it clearly indicated that Qualcomm has strong intentions to catapult its way into mobile payments, apart from Internet-of-Things and connected devices. Mobile based payment is complex business area and is still evolving. To offer comprehensive services in compliance with the upcoming regulatory guidelines and security benchmarks, it will become almost impossible for a company X offering a service, for example mobile wallet,  to bypass using a security solution like ‘tokenization’ patented by company Y. A 2016 Bloomberg report highlights the seriousness with which fintech companies are taking their patent portfolio and how they intend to compete with the tech giants in asserting their IP. Since, mobile phone manufacturers are the front-end contenders, it gives them even stronger reason to assess the technology, competitive standings and patent landscape of mobile payments. Building a streamlined patent portfolio by identifying technology trends and filling the corresponding gaps can prove crucial. It will not only enable the phone makers to offer more robust mobile payment services but also prepare for the upcoming patent wars.

Tech Industry by Alfred Ng January 6, 2017 6:56 AM PST @alfredwkng Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS Apple's Tim Cook gets a pay cut Due to Apple's declining sales figures, Tim Cook's wallet isn't as fat as it was in previous years. by Iyaz Akhtar 1:03 Close Drag Apple failed to meet its annual sales goals in 2016, and CEO Tim Cook paid the price. Cook earned $8.75 million in 2016, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing from Apple on Friday. That compares with $10.28 million in 2015, and $9.22 million in 2014. The Cupertino, California-based company had aimed to surpass its $223.6 billion in sales from 2015. Instead it fell short in 2016, raking in $215.6 billion. Because of the dip, Apple executives, including Cook, received only 89.5 percent of their annual cash incentives. For 2016, Cook's total compensation included $5.37 million in cash incentive pay, compared with $8 million in 2015 and $6.7 million in 2014. His base salary increased, though, from $2 million in 2015 to $3 million last year. Apple struggled with iPhone sales in 2016 -- the first time its flagship phone saw shipment declines. The company makes more than two-thirds of its revenue from the iPhone, so the device's drop put a dent in Apple's revenue. Apple did not respond to requests for comment. Meanwhile, the company is playing up its App Store sales boost, with its highest revenue ever in 2016, according to the filing. The momentum continues to roll into 2017. New Year's Day was its biggest sales day ever.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney This was Apple's prototype for the iPhone by David Goldman   @DavidGoldmanCNN January 7, 2017: 4:05 PM ET The original iPhone almost looked like this An early prototype of the iPhone reveals how Apple considered making its iconic smartphone a lot more like the iPod. A newly discovered video, posted to YouTube by independent tech journalist Sonny Dickson, shows an iPhone running an iPod-like precursor to the iOS operating system, dubbed Acorn. In the prototype, the iPhone was controlled by a virtual "click wheel" in the bottom half of the screen, not the familiar touch-button apps we know today. The prototype had a menu display in the top half, just like early version of the iPod, and a black strip in the middle with buttons for rewind, menu, play/pause and fast forward. The Acorn software was entirely text-based, with options for "favorites," "recents," "dial" and "SMS," in addition to all the menu items familiar to iPod users at the time. Though the video doesn't show a call being placed, it gives us a peek at a dialer that probably would have driven iPhone owners insane. It appears as though people would have had to dial numbers like on an old rotary phone. God help them if they wanted to type a text message. "You can see why we ditched it?" iPod designer and former Apple executive Tony Fadell tweeted Friday morning. SW version of iPod+Phone for UI team. You can see why we ditched it? Apple's click wheel iPhone https://t.co/622WOH9WfI @Verge @jjvincent— Tony Fadell (@tfadell) January 6, 2017 The click-wheel iPhone has long been legend. Steve Jobs biographer Walter Isaacson wrote that Apple's engineers weren't sure customers would be able to master a smartphone with a touchscreen, so they pursued an alternate operating system controlled by a click wheel. Until Friday, a patent filed in 2006 was our only glimpse at what a click-wheel iPhone could have looked like. It turns out the patent drawings were very similar to the prototype revealed on Friday. Early prototypes for the iPhone are rarely seen: Apple famously destroys its rejected designs to avoid leaks. But we've been treated to a few glimpses into Apple engineers' thinking about how the first iPhone should have been designed. A patent dispute with Samsung in 2012 made public several early versions of the iPhone's hardware, including some truly odd shapes and sizes. According to Isaacson's biography, Apple's engineers got fully behind the touchscreen concept because they could not figure out how to dial and text using a click wheel. The touchscreen iPhone we're all familiar with ultimately debuted in 2007.

In a statement celebrating ten years since the tech giant first announced its iconic handset, Cook says the company is "just getting started".  He did not, however, unveil any details about what the company is planning to introduce on its next handset, which is rumoured to launch this autumn with a significant design overhaul. US-based wireless company Energous last week revealed it had signed a deal with "one of the largest consumer electronic companies in the world", fuelling speculation the new iPhone may have wireless charging features. Speaking to The Verge ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Energous chief executive Steve Rizzone said the company had agreed a deal with a "key strategic partner" and would ship products featuring its wire-free technology "by the end of 2017".  According to MacRumors, the next iPhone will feature an all-glass case to house the wireless charging features as the existing metal casing can "limit the speed" of battery charging. This would also correspond with Apple designer Jony Ive's vision of a phone resembling a single sheet of glass, the site adds, a concept he has wanted "for several years".  While the iPhone 8 is expected to be a real game-changer, TrustedReviews says Apple may be working on two other models, which could feature an "iterative design" and be called the "iPhone 7S and 7S Plus".  iPhone 8: Energous fuels wireless charging rumours 6 January Rumours that the iPhone 8 will offer wireless charging have been bolstered by claims from Energous that it has signed a deal with "one of the largest consumer electronic companies in the world". Speaking to The Verge ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, chief executive Steve Rizzone said the company had agreed a "key strategic partnership" and will start shipping transmitters that can charge devices wirelessly from several feet away "by the end of 2017". He added: "I cannot tell you who [the partner] is, but I can virtual guarantee that you have products from this company on your person, sitting on your desk, or at home." According to the Verge, Energous "certainly doesn't mind speculation" that this partner is Apple. The US-based company, which develops wireless products, was first expected to release a wire-free charger towards the end of 2015, adds the site, although its plans changed when it signed the agreement that year. Under the deal, Energous's partner will be the first to ship its products inside "phones, laptops, tablets, and certain wearables and accessories".  If true, the shipping time would fall into place with the expected launch window of the rumoured iPhone 8. It was reported by MacRumors that the phone will feature an all-glass case to accommodate wireless charging features, as the current metal design can "limit the speed at which charging takes place". This also fits into Apple designer Jony Ive's vision of a phone that looks like a single sheet of glass, the site adds, a concept he has wanted "for several years".  Apple often uses its iPhones to unveil technology that will then be transferred to its other products. Its fingerprint scanner and Lightning connector both debuted on the phones, as did the virtual assistant Siri, which last year appeared on the MacBook range.  iPhone 8: Will game-changing handset feauture new Touch Bar? 4 January Apple's latest smartphone, the iPhone 7, is only a few months old, but fans are already creating concept designs for the iPhone 8.  A video from YouTuber Apple Designer imagines a smartphone that combines several rumours about the next generation, such as the absence of the home button and a USB-C charger, into one design. Video of iPhone 8 Concept avec Touch Bar The imagined phone also includes an adapted version of Apple's Touch Bar at the bottom of the display in place of the home button. It could be used to unlock the device or expand the keyboard to include emojis in the Messages app. See related  Nokia to sue Apple for patent infringement Apple pulls New York Times at Chinese censors' request Tesla update brings Faraday Future-rivalling performance boost It is believed the iPhone 8 will be released this autumn, with the tech giant skipping an 'S' version, the traditional follow-up to a new number, in favour of a new device to celebrate the phone's tenth anniversary. The Korea Herald reports it will feature a plastic curved OLED display from Samsung, with sources claiming it may incorporate "new sensing technology" that allows users to touch the sides of the device.  However, TechnoBuffalo says Apple are often slow to "adopt to new trends" and it's more probably the iPhone 8 will be a "general follow up" rather than a generation overhaul.  iPhone 8: next iPhone may get curved OLED display 19 December Apple's iPhone 7 has only been on sale for three months, but attention is already turning to next year's smartphone reveal. Celebrating the phone's ten-year anniversary in 2017, the tech giant is rumoured to skip past the '7S' variant and instead debut the iPhone 8. While this year's device was closer to an evolution of the formula, the iPhone 8 is tipped to have many more significant changes, including a raft of new technologies. A report issued by the Korean Herald suggests the iPhone 8 will receive a plastic OLED display that will feature curved edges similar to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Sources claim the new iPhone may incorporate "new sensing technology" that allows users to "touch any side of the device", the site says. Speculation surrounding an OLED display began in October, with AppleInsider reporting the firm has recently been approved for a patent to position the home button and FaceTime camera under the screen. Last month, it was rumoured that the iPhone 8 may feature an "all-glass casing" to accommodate wireless charging, says MacRumors. It is also believed Jony Ive has wanted to design a device that looks like a single sheet of glass "for several years", the site adds. iPhone 8: The iPhone may finally get wireless charging 02 November Barely two months have passed since the launch of the iPhone 7, but attention is already turning to next year's big Apple smartphone launch.  The tech giant is tipped to go straight past introducing an 'S' version of its current phone, and will instead debut the iPhone 8 next year. Unlike this year's device – criticised by some for being a minor upgrade – 2017's iPhone is rumoured to be a game-changer, and will introduce several new technologies and features in one fell swoop.   The big rumour is that it'll get a completely edge-to-edge OLED display, with no buttons whatsoever on the phone's face.  Now a new report issued by Nikkei suggests that the iPhone 8 could introduce a feature many of Apple's Android rivals already have up their sleeves – wireless charging.   According to the paper, Apple's manufacturing partner Foxconn is currently testing wireless charging modules, which could make their way into next year's smartphone.  MacRumors says it's unclear if wireless charging will be a feature included in all upcoming iPhone 8 models, or if it'll be offered exclusively on the iPhone 8 Plus, just as this year's iPhone 7 Plus has exclusive camera hardware.   Rumours about wireless charging are nothing new, and Apple is thought to have lofty ambitions for the technology.  Earlier this year it was reported that the company was exploring "extended wireless charging", which would allow users to do away with their charging mats. Instead, the new technology would allow Apple to use radio waves to reach and recharge phones up to 15 feet away.   The iPhone 8 will arrive next September, so there's still plenty of time before all is revealed.  iPhone 8: Everything we know so far 28 October Apple's iPhone 7 hasn't been on sale for two months yet but fans are already readying themselves for next year's release.  In any normal year, 2017 would see the introduction of an iPhone 7S – Apple only releases new, redesigned devices once every two years, with improved "S" versions filling in the gap.  If rumours are true, though, next year promises to be different as 2017 marks the tenth anniversary of Apple entering the smartphone industry. It has gone on to become the company's most profitable venture by a significant margin, which is why fans are expecting something special to celebrate.  Releasing an S version of the 7, a smartphone that has been criticised by many for being too similar to the iPhone 6 and 6S, would be an unpopular move. A lot of iPhone fans are resting their hopes on 2017's device being a game-changer.  Here are all the rumours so far. iPhone 8 release date It seems a safe bet that the phone will be released in September, Apple's traditional time for unveiling new devices. However, it could be that the tech giant will break with tradition as it marks ten years of iPhones, says PC Advisor. Complete design overhaul The iPhone has been redesigned many times since it hit the market in 2007, but every handset has had the same face – two large bezels top and bottom and a round home button underneath the display. But early rumours are pointing towards a radical new design language coming next year. It's believed the iPhone 8 will do away with the bezels and instead feature a complete edge-to-edge display with the home button, selfie camera and speaker either hidden beneath or integrated into it. The latest word comes from respected and consistently accurate Apple tipster Ming-Chi Kuo, whose most recent scoop has been picked up by MacRumors. He says the edge-to-edge iPhone won't look like a single sheet of glass, as has been reported, but will be reinforced by an aluminium or stainless steel frame. The phone will be made predominantly from glass, though, stepping away from the aluminium designs used since the iPhone 5. Curved glass? In June, the Wall Street Journal suggested the new phone might have curved glass, something Apple is believed to have been working on for some time. MacRumours says this could mean the display of the iPhone 8 is curved at each edge, in the manner of the Samsung Galaxy S7. No more LCD The iPhone 8 may not use a traditional LCD (liquid crystal display), replacing it with a flexible OLED (organic light-emitting diode). This will make for a thinner phone that uses less power - something that might help with battery life. The OLED should have colours that are more true to life and a higher contrast ratio, says MacRumours. No more wires? Apple is "late to the wireless charging party", says PC Advisor, and pundits are confident it will join in with the iPhone 8 - removing the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is widely seen as a step towards that. According to TechRadar, Apple might just "go beyond rivals and offer a truly wireless charger that works at a distance". A similar camera It's rumoured that not much will change with the iPhone 8 camera, although the optical image stabilisation (OIS) technology introduced on the iPhone 7 might be extended to the selfie camera on the new device. Glass or metal? Sources claim Apple will return to glass-bodied phones after several generations of aluminium. TechRadar says there might be a choice: the iPhone 8 could be glass and the iPhone 8 Plus metal - or vice versa. Three sizes?  The latest rumour comes from Japanese newspaper Nikkei and has been doing the rounds on the usual assortment of dedicated Apple blogs and rumour sites.  Nikkei suggests Apple may introduce not two, but three iPhone 8s next year, all of them with different size displays.  At the moment, Apple makes its smartphone with 4.7ins or 5.5ins screen sizes. These are expected to remain, but a five-inch model will reportedly slip between them. All three will have glass casings, but only the most expensive model will get an OLED display.  Price? It really is too early to speculate, except to say the phones are unlikely to cost less than the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which start at £599 and £719. iPhone 8: Is this Chinese phone the best look yet? 25 October Apple's iPhone 8 should make quite an impact when it arrives next September.  Rumours suggest that Apple is set to skip doing an S version of the recently introduced iPhone 7, partly because the device is a refreshed iPhone 6S, but mostly because 2017 marks ten years since the introduction of the original iPhone.  It's said that Apple has something special lined up for the iPhone's tenth anniversary, and that the iPhone 8 will be a completely re-designed handset, with an appearance unlike any iPhone before it.  Apple is tipped to switch to OLED displays, replacing the LCD panels it has used since the original device. It is also rumoured that the iPhone 8 will have an edge-to-edge display with curves at the edges, so the phone's face is a large, uninterrupted screen with no bezels or buttons.  If you haven't yet bought the iPhone 7, that may be enough to keep you from upgrading until next year. But if Xiaomi's latest handset is anything to go by, you'll be able to buy a phone just like the rumoured iPhone 8 very shortly. The Chinese company has just revealed its latest flagship handset. Called the Mi Mix, it is set to launch on 4 November, and it features a huge 6.4ins display tucked right up to the edges of the phone, covering 93 per cent of the device's face. The only significant bezel is at the bottom, but it features no buttons: everything is controlled onscreen, except for the fingerprint scanner on the back. Inside it gets the latest Snapdragon 821 chipset mated to 4GB or 6GB of RAM, depending on which spec you choose. There's no word of a UK release, but in China it'll cost the equivalent of £425 when it arrives.  The iPhone 8 is expected to be a little different, using a glass case rather than a metal one, and with the fingerprint scanner and FaceTime camera embedded under the display. But MacRumors still says the Mi Mix "may give us some idea of what Apple's next phone could look like".  iPhone 8: Home button could be behind the display? 10 October Apple's iPhone 7 has been out for less than a month, but the rumour mill for next year's iPhone model is already in overdrive. Apple is tipped to skip over the iPhone 7S next year and leap straight to iPhone 8, with a radically redesigned handset marking ten years since the introduction of the original handset in 2007. It's said that next year's iPhone will look completely different thanks to an edge-to-edge OLED display that could take up the entire front side of the device, as well as a glass body similar to the one on the iPhone 4 and 4S. The phone's iconic home button and large top and bottom bezels will be no more. To achieve this, Apple has to embed hardware like the FaceTime camera, speaker and – crucially – home button underneath the next iPhone's display. AppleInsider believes it may have found out how the internet giant can overcome this design hurdle.   Last week, the site reported a newly uncovered Apple patent filed in 2014 and recently approved, accurately outlining fingerprint and sensor technology that would allow fingerprints to be read on a scanner behind the screen. It's one of the biggest leaks so far to support rumours that Apple is working on a home button-less smartphone. To get around the gap between a user's finger and the sensor below the display, Apple proposes using electrostatic lenses in order to achieve an accurate image of the finger or thumbprint through the screen. As ever with patents, it's unclear if Apple is actively developing the technology and if it will end up in an iPhone, but this new information does reveal one of the methods Apple might use if it decides to go ahead with a new smartphone with no home button.

Starbucks recently promoted its reusable cups by asking fans to doodle on them. Credit: Starbucks Most Popular I just received an email from an "advocate marketing" company, it opened with the following: "For years now consumer brands like Apple, GoPro and Starbucks have made billions on user-generated content; countless fan photographs and videos used in their marketing campaigns." The email then asked, "So what's stopping you from doing the same?" And it's (mostly) true. These companies make billions through creation and ownership of user-generated content (UGC), as well as the creation of scripted and unscripted content. These brands understand that in order to monetize earned media and content in a meaningful way, they must convert it to owned media. As a result, they have evolved from their core businesses into media companies. Let's look at the three examples mentioned: Starbucks. Starbucks started down the path of becoming a media company in 1999, when it acquired Hear Media, A record label focused on ambient coffee house sounds. With the acquisition, Diana Krall and Norah Jones fans could stock up on their latest sounds while waiting for their Caramel Frappuccinos. Starbucks also scored a big win with their recent "White Cup Contest" campaign, designed to promote their reusable cups by asking fans to doodle away on their cups, paying the best with $300 gift cards in exchange for UGC rights. And with their new original content series, "Upstanders," Starbucks is again proving that they understand the importance of offering customers a vast array of original, digital content in order to stay relevant. GoPro. Every consumer that buys a GoPro has the potential to become a content creator. As a result, GoPro spent the past two years building a platform of the best creators, providing them with the hardware, funding and platforms needed to become original content creators for the company. If any company has an inherent advantage when it comes to content creation, it's GoPro. Apple. Let's look at the powerhouse that is Apple. The media-consumption experience Apple created allows it to tightly control the distribution of more media and content than any other company in the world. But when it comes to UGC, Apple takes a different approach. Rather than pandering to their customers for UGC through #hashtag campaigns, Apple quietly scours the Internet for the best UGC, then contacts those content creators to buy rights to this work. The result? The "Shot on iPhone" campaign, with more than 10,000 billboard installations around the world, allowed Apple to turn the world into its gallery. Why the future is owned vs. earned Even though thousands of articles have been written on the importance of engaging customers for UGC, only a handful discuss the importance of UGC ownership. As a result, nearly 99% of UGC is owned by the social networks. They own the UGC and the metadata behind each piece of UGC. For example, when brands run hashtag campaigns on Instagram, the only real winner   is Instagram. Instagram owns branded UGC, licensed and royalty-free, and the metadata behind the UGC generated from the hashtag campaign. Customer don't win anything for their loyalty, and the brand is left with a few minutes of reach, at best. And Instagram knows your customers better than you. Own your UGC. If your goal as a brand is to generate reach and buzz, ownership of your UGC isn't necessary. Hashtag campaigns are an easy way to generate reach and buzz. However, if you want to measure, monetize, and create long-term engagement opportunities with customers, building campaigns that allow you to own your UGC, both the content and the metadata, is key. Owning your UGC removes any potential legal risks associated with republishing or using your UGC in future campaigns, and your brand has the opportunity to collect the rich metadata behind each piece of UGC. Why the metadata too? Metadata contained in every photo and video has unique, dynamic data that can't be gleaned anywhere else. Capturing the metadata behind every piece of UGC helps your brand drive a deeper level of understanding of your customers… who they are, buying patterns, geolocation, phone type, contact information, and more. With this metadata, your brand has the information necessary to have a highly customized, 1:1 conversation with your customers. Because if content is king, its metadata is heir to the throne. You can do whatever you want with it. When your brand owns UGC created by your fans, your brand can use that content licensed and royalty-free, in print, digital, and social campaigns -- publicly celebrating them, and giving them the recognition they deserve. What's stopping you? Back to the email that inspired this article, and its question, "what's stopping you from doing the same?" Gary Vaynerchuk, CEO of Vayner Media, said it best: "The faster your business realizes that it's a media company, the more likely it will be to succeed." Media is in the DNA of Starbucks, GoPro, and Apple. They understand how important it is to own content in order to monetize it. In order to monetize UGC in the future, and use this content in a meaningful way, it can't be earned, it must be owned.

REUTERS/Stephen Lam Karen Turner The Washington Post, WP Bloomberg Jan 6, 2017 at 8:30 am | Print View Apple rang in the New Year with some good news: the first day of 2017 marked the highest daily sales ever for App Stores. The company took in $240 million from app purchases on Jan. 1 through its app platform App Store, according to a news release published Thursday. That’s after a year of record-breaking subscriptions and downloads, “generating over $20 billion for developers,” the company said. Apple’s App Store got about half of the downloads of its main competitor Google Play in 2016, yet it brought in twice the revenue in the third quarter, according to app analytics firm App Annie. The numbers were similar for the rest of 2016. Apple also saw an uptick in subscription billings, a 74 percent increase from last year that came in at $2.7 billion total. One reason might be the relative affluence of Apple iPhone owners compared to Android users given the higher price of their devices, which typically correlates with higher spending, said Danielle Levitas, senior vice president of research at App Annie. “I think the most surprising thing is just how strong Apple’s revenue lead is and how it continues to beat the market’s growth,” Levitas said. She added that the kinds of apps published on the platform range from games to e-commerce, entertainment, and banking, meaning that a wide breadth of companies are gaining exposure. “It’s not just about app store revenue but rather increased engagement with apps in terms of time spent.” Sales in China, Japan, the United States and the United Kingdom brought in the most revenue for the App Store. Downloads from Chinese users in particular boomed, increasing by 90 percent from last year, according to Apple. That’s despite slowing device sales, MarketWatch reported. Pokémon Go was the most downloaded app last year. Other popular downloads included Super Mario Run as well as subscription based apps such as Netflix and HBO Go. Last year’s introduction of iMessage apps, directly integrated into iOS’s messaging platform to allow users to send stickers and play games via chat, accounted for 21,000 new apps on App Store. “The fact that Apple continues to grow its installed base and gain dollars per user is very impressive,” said Levitas. apple-store Your next Nation & World articles Researchers identify Japanese tapeworm p ...

Now let’s take a look at LinkedIn, Evernote and Microsoft ‘One online advocacy organization labelled Apple the “world leader in globalizing Chinese censorship”.’ Photograph: Thomas Peter/Reuters Contact author @melissakchan Friday 6 January 2017 10.14 EST Last modified on Monday 9 January 2017 04.55 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close News of Apple pulling the New York Times app from its store in China has been met with the expected outrage on social media. One online advocacy organisation labelled Apple the “world leader in globalising Chinese censorship”. Tom Grundy of Hong Kong Free Press, an independent online news outlet, tweeted that Apple was now “eagerly assisting” in censorship. And the New York Times’s own correspondent, Chris Buckley, asked on Twitter whether Apple owed an explanation to the paper’s Chinese readers. I actually think we should hold some of our fire, or at least stop short of singling Apple out as the worst offender I have experience with Chinese censorship, as both target and witness of it. As a reporter there for five years, I – along with the rest of the foreign press corps – often faced attempts at both the local and national level to interfere with and stop our coverage. And as someone who happened to be in China when social media and cloud-based technology started taking off, I also filed many stories on China’s moves to block Facebook, Twitter and Google. Here’s a list of major websites blocked in the country. As much as I have spoken up against Chinese censorship, and as often as I berate Mark Zuckerberg’s blatant kowtowing in order to get Facebook back into China, I actually think we should hold some of our fire, or at least stop short of singling Apple out as the worst offender. I say this as someone who has also covered Silicon Valley as a Bay Area-based correspondent. In the United States, Apple has a strong track record as an industry leader against government attempts to access users’ data. It has butted heads directly with the Obama administration over issues of privacy and security, calling it a fight for civil liberties. It has taken unpopular positions, including refusing to cooperate with the FBI to help agents read the encrypted data from domestic terrorist Syed Farook’s iPhone. This is a technology company that has appeared to have at least tried, at times, to do the right thing. Of course, Apple has not manufactured iPhones in China without scandal. From stories of factory workers being made ill by the chemicals used to make iPhone touch screens, to a spate of suicides at a manufacturer’s campuses, Apple’s record is checkered. Cynics might add that Apple only shoulders responsibility when it also happens to improve the company’s bottom line, or when it’s easy. In the United States, Apple has recourse to a functioning legal system to launch its battles. In China, where the rule of law is weak, it means a much tougher environment and far fewer options when the company disagrees with government decisions. The situation is complicated by the tremendous leverage the Chinese government has over Apple. Not only is the iPhone manufactured there, but sales of Apple products in China account for a quarter of its global revenue. Apple has not explained its latest decision and which law the New York Times has fallen foul to. The newspaper has a Chinese-language edition of its paper. In 2012, Beijing blocked both the Chinese and English-language websites, but readers could continue reading articles if they downloaded the apps to their iPhones. Now, Apple has removed both English and Chinese-language apps from its store, making it impossible to read the New York Times unless users know how to employ circumvention tools. Maybe the larger the company, the more scrutiny it should receive. In that spirit, Apple’s decision to pull the apps deserves full moral fury. But keep in mind that every single US tech company in China makes compromises in order to enter the market. LinkedIn restricts its content. Evernote, like Apple, stores Chinese account holders’ data on Chinese servers so that authorities may access the information. Microsoft censors. None of this is right. Apple removes New York Times app in China Read more Few foreign companies have taken the moral stand that Google did by exiting China. I remember when the company made that decision. Supporters of a more open China dropped off flowers outside its Beijing offices, excited that it had made such a bold move. But if anybody had hoped Google’s defection would launch an exodus, it never happened. Since then, Chinese censorship and attempts to control foreign companies have only become more odious, with no indication it will let up. Apple’s problem today, is another foreign company’s conundrum tomorrow. Its dependance on China serves as a case study for how the story will repeatedly, dismally play out. All this stops only when the financial incentives to do business in China, and with China, disappear.

(Photo: Apple) Apple CEO Tim Cook and other top executives saw their 2016 pay drop after the tech giant finished the year with lower revenue off weaker sales of its flagship iPhone. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Cook received $8.75 million in total compensation, which includes a $3 million base salary. In 2015, Cook earned more than $10 million. Other top execs including Eddy Cue, who runs Internet software and services at Apple, and retail chief Angela Ahrendts, also saw declines in compensation for 2016. The filing says execs received 89.5% of cash incentives for the year, during which Apple reported its first decline in annual sales since 2001. Operating income also sunk from $71.2 billion in 2015 to $60 billion last year. Shares of Apple are up nearly 1% in Friday trading. For 2016, Apple shares climbed 11%. FindTheCompany | Graphiq The dip in revenue is tied to sales of the iPhone, down from previous years. During the fourth quarter, Apple sold 45.5 million iPhones, a 5% drop from the same time last year. Meanwhile, a report from Nikkei Asian Review says Apple will cut production of the iPhone during its 2017 first quarter. This year could provide the iPhone and Apple with a sales rebound. It marks the 10th anniversary of the device, and rumors suggest Apple has big plans for the next iPhone, which should launch in the fall.

REUTERS/Jerry Lampen/Files    5408758 An influential Chinese tabloid attacked The New York Times Friday for spreading its “rabid ideological” views and opinions to China. Apple officially removed the English-language and Chinese-language apps for The New York Times from the China App Store in late December after deeming it “in violation of local regulations.” While the move triggered a protest from the New York Times, The Global Times, a publication produced by the state-run People’s Daily, argues the ban was justified. The Chinese internet censorship authorities began blocking The New York Times website in 2012 following a series of less-than-flattering investigative reports. The Global Times accused The New York Times Friday of “trying to wield influence in China’s internal affairs” by “churning out sensational stories about sensitive topics.” Citing U.S. concerns about the spread of Russian and Chinese propaganda and disinformation into American society, the Global Times argued, “How should Beijing not keep alert about rabid ideological organs like The New York Times?” “Some Western media overestimate their status and values,” the Chinese tabloid explained, noting that greater China contributes to roughly one-fifth of Apple’s revenue, giving it the power to force the company to bend to its will. Apple “cares most about business, so it is willing to respect Chinese laws,” the paper argued. China became Apple’s biggest iPhone market in April 2015. “Managing information in the Internet era is a challenge that all the countries need to face,” The Global Times explained, “China cannot do anything about The New York Times if it makes up stories outside China. But it is another situation if it is the Chinese market.” The apps for other big-time media outlets, such as the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times, are still available. The Chinese tabloid suggested that The New York Times “reflect on its app removal.” “If these media get involved in the complicated process of China’s rise in a proper way rather than taking a hostile mentality toward China, they will be accepted,” indicating that those who take an opposing stance will fall. The New York Times has asked Apple to reconsider the recent ban, claiming that the removal of the app “is part of a wider attempt to prevent readers in China from accessing independent news coverage from The New York Times.” “The Chinese government encourages and supports internet development, [but] the development of Internet in China must follow the principle of conforming to Chinese laws and regulations,” Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang said during a regular press briefing Thursday.

The news that Cook’s compensation was cut from $10.28M in 2015 to $8.75M in 2016 was spotted in a regulatory filing by the WSJ. Apple said its annual sales of $215.6 billion were 3.7% below its target of $223.6 billion, and its operating income of $60 billion was 0.5% short of the $60.3 billion target. As a result, company executives got 89.5% of their targeted annual cash incentive. Cook wasn’t the only one to lose out … While Cook saw the largest cut in percentage terms, at 15%, other named execs saw an average 9.6% year-on-year reduction in compensation. Cook voluntarily opted to receive the majority of his compensation in stock awards closely tied to the company’s financial performance. However, his largest stock award was for remaining CEO for five years, earning him a cool $100M. He later liquidated $65M worth of shares, leaving him with a holding at the time of some $110M. Cook announced back in 2015 that he would give away almost all of his wealth during the course of his lifetime. Apple has also confirmed the date of its next shareholder’s meeting, which will take place on February 28 at its Infinite Loop campus. Photo: AP Photo/J.

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Jan 6, 2017 at 9:14AM For the past few years, home automation -- the so-called smart home -- has been coming, but in 2017 it might be time to say it's here. Products like Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo/Alexa and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Home, along with Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone/Siri, have become viable platforms to control smart homes. And while only Amazon and Google have an official presence at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), smart-home devices that work with one or more of those platforms (as well as others) were one of the dominant trends at the show. In fact, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), which puts on the show, released a new report on the eve of CES saying that smart homes would be the "most popular means of Internet of Things engagement." CTA also predicted sales of 29 million units in 2017, a 63% percent increase over 2016. To make that happen, companies need to deliver devices that meet consumer needs. A new survey from Coldwell Banker Real Estate and Vivint Smart Homes found that there is one feature that a majority of Americans want on their smart-home devices: voice control. Smart home devices were everywhere at CES 2017. Image source: author. What does the survey say? The report showed that more than 7 in 10 (72%) Americans who already have smart-home products controlled remotely by a smartphone, tablet, computer, or separate automatic system within the home itself want voice control. But, only 48% of people who have smart-home devices, the report found, already have voice control capability. "We're not surprised that so many Americans want to be able to use their voice to control smart home products because it makes for a much more intuitive user experience," said Coldwell Banker Chief Marketing Officer Sean Blankenship. " ... we're hearing directly from our agents that their clients are demanding voice control to make their smart home experience more seamless." Parents want voice control, according to the research, and nearly 4 in 5 (79%) of Generation X members have smart-home products but want voice control. That's followed by millennials at 74%, and baby boomers at 63%. "Last year we announced our integration with Amazon Echo and we've been blown away with how consumers are unlocking the full potential of a voice-controlled smart home," said Vivint CMO Jeff Lyman. "By simply saying aloud what they want to happen with their locks, lights, thermostats and security system, customers spend more time living and less time managing. The experience is pretty magical." What are Americans using voice control for? When it comes to people who have smart homes with voice control and people who want smart homes with voice control, the top use in both cases is entertainment. That was the top use for the former at 57% and the latter at 43%. In both cases, controlling smart lighting was the second choice. Image source: Coldwell Banker/Vivint. Why is voice control important? Most Americans believe that voice control will give them a more intuitive user experience, according to the Coldwell Banker/Vivint report, which was produced by surveying 4,108 U.S. adults ages 18 and older, among whom 923 have any smart home products. "The most commonly cited benefits for using voice control among respondents were hands-free control at 30%, increased user-friendliness at 17% and flexibility in location at 14%," read the study. Part of the reason Americans want voice control in their smart-home devices is because they are already comfortable with the technology. Of the people surveyed who already have smart-home products, 74% of them said they use voice control on their smartphones. This is what's coming While Siri has stumbled at least partly because Apple launched it without tightly limiting its parameters and Google's Assistant has yet to make much of a mark, Amazon Echo shows that people will use voice control at home. Going from asking a digital assistant to tell you the weather or playing a song to having one actually control your home will take some time. Amazon has taken a smart approach by slowly adding functionality and opening up its Echo/Alexa platform to outside developers. That has given the company a foothold in people's houses that might allow it to expand its presence. Apple, Google, and maybe even a few others have a chance to work their way in as well (and a quick look around at CES shows that dozens, maybe hundreds are trying to get involved in some fashion), but it's very clear that whatever products people select, voice control will have to be a key component.

Skip to content Cookery Fitness Motoring DD Pets Hairdressing Menu News Sport Courts Jobs Sales & Services Obituaries Features Business Politics Council News Search for: Doherty disappointed as Apple refuse to attend Finance Committee meeting NEWS January 5, 2017 Pearse Doherty TD has expressed disappointment and anger at the decision by Apple not to attend upcoming Finance Committee hearings on the tax affairs of Apple in light of the EU’s State Aid ruling against Ireland. Deputy Doherty said he is disappointed and angered by the decision of Mr Tim Cook not to attend the Committee. “The EU’s State Aid ruling has created a huge debate in this country about our tax affairs and it is only right the Finance Committee of the Oireachtas carry out hearings on this issue. Mr Cook appeared before the US Senate hearings and it was his comments there that sparked much of the discussion and possibly even EU action in this case. For him to refuse to attend the Committee now is disrespectful to the Irish people. “He has also not been shy in speaking to Irish media about the case and his views on why the EU is wrong in its findings so the excuse of an ongoing legal case is not valid. After all both the Irish government and EU Commission are involved in that appeal and I expect both to attend the Committee. One would have thought Mr Cook would be keen to put Apple’s view before the Irish people. “I will push for the Finance Committee to write to Mr Cook requesting that he reconsider his position. I will also be pushing the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach to make contact with Mr Cook and let him know that they believe an invitation by an Oireachtas Committee is important and that the government believes he should attend. “When I first suggested, some years ago, inviting in multinational CEOs as part of a Committee investigation into Global Tax, I was voted down by Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and Labour. This time, there was unanimous political support for the invitation. It is all the more disappointing therefore that Mr Cook has refused.” Post navigation Finn Harps oldest fan Benny ready for another season: Is he League of Ireland’s oldest fan?

The rise of social disruptors and importance of differentiation Vice president of strategic accounts Ruth Arber: New platforms like Snapchat are changing the way we talk to friends and share content. Snapchat has altered the user experience and disrupted the social sphere by changing the way users relate to each other on social, and now Snap Inc. has the potential to disrupt the product sphere. Spectacles could be one of the more tangible and realistic internet of things products, and they have already begun changing the purchasing experience with their pop-up vending machines. Co-founder and CEO Nikhil Sethi: More of these companies that were pure platforms will begin to build hardware. We’ve already seen this with Spectacles and Oculus. Pursuing hardware creates new formats and more types of experiences for people, which will ultimately create more advertising opportunities for the platforms. Apple is a huge underdog in this space because people don’t necessarily include it when they talk about Facebook and Snapchat, but Apple has something that competes with them at every level. It has iMessage, one of the biggest messaging applications with features similar to Facebook Messenger; it has one of the biggest camera apps with filters like Instagram and Snapchat; it has iTunes with capabilities that rival YouTube. The only challenge is that there isn’t a network in place for sharing those things, but that’s only one step away. I wouldn’t be surprised to see them enter the VR/augmented reality space in the next year, as well. Something that has less obvious marketing implications is the evolution of the car. As cars become more autonomous, it frees up so much time that will go into using walled gardens instead. If you have an hour commute and you’re no longer doing the driving yourself, you’ll start spending that time on Facebook. There will be more ad loading, more consumption, more data creation. The amount of time the average American spends in a car is huge. Collectively, if you remove the amount of time spent actively engaged in transit and give it to something else, that creates a huge uptick in platform usage, which further compresses out-of-home television, print, radio. It moves all of that time into walled gardens. Advertising dollars Sethi: Walled gardens will continue to take a bigger share of advertising budgets. In particular, they will steal dollars away from traditional mediums. The loser in 2016 was print, and the loser in 2017 is shaping up to be television. Especially with formats like Stories emerging, which are linear distribution channels similar to television, ad dollars that would be devoted to TV ads will increasingly go into walled gardens. Client partner, Europe, Middle East and Africa Emily Huff: Increasingly, brands are realizing that the days of solely relying on organic social are over, with recent reports showing lower-than-ever reach figures on both Facebook (2 percent) and Twitter (3 percent). As a result, digital marketers are likely to increase their focus on paid social initiatives while continuing to explore platforms such as Instagram, Pinterest, and Snapchat. As more brands begin to understand the unprecedented potential to connect with and engage consumers through social, I expect to see a correlating increase in spend on paid social; not only on Facebook (which so far has been the dominating platform) but also on the more recently established channels. Live video Arber: The opportunity to own live TV streaming on social is up for grabs, and we can expect to see every major social player compete for it. Cord-cutters have created an opening on mobile that platforms can fill if they are able to dominate TV networks looking to reach unplugged viewers. So far, Twitter seems to have the best handle on livestreaming, with deals with every major sports league and several networks. Snapchat moving to a licensing model with its Discover publishers suggests that it has an eye on becoming a content media channel. Account director, Europe, Middle East and Africa Milana Saric: 2016 was the year when Facebook made its live broadcasting feature available to all users. Next year, I expect we will see a significant increase in advertising spend on boosting livestream coverage on the platform. Video has long been one of the vital elements of social media marketing, especially for building brand awareness, and we will see brands utilize Facebook Live for branding purposes by engaging users in current happenings and events. Moreover, Snapchat has proved to be an enormous hit with U.K. users and businesses alike, and it is set to keep on thriving as a new and exciting advertising platform next year. Real-time communication focused on in-the-moment and live content is likely to see an increase in advertising spend across all verticals, ranging from filters to video ads within the Snapchat user feed. Senior VP of media operations Matt Burgoon: 87 percent of consumer use second screens while watching TV, often to participate in a larger conversation around a live TV event. This behavior has created an exciting opportunity for social platforms to provide a full viewing experience through livestreaming. Twitter in particular, the go-to platform for live events, has the ability to bring user content together with live video to give viewers comprehensive coverage without forcing them to split time between screens. Keeping an eye on social conversations about a favorite team can distract users from watching the game itself, but by placing related tweets and trending content alongside the action, Twitter is able to put all relevant game-time content in one place. While sports livestreaming on the platform is still in its early stages, there is potential for Twitter to integrate with any sports league app through smart TV apps to provide the fullest viewing experience to fans and bring them closer to the heart of real-time content. Messaging apps Arber: Privacy will be a key focus for messaging apps in 2017. Facebook is building out capabilities for brands to reach out to customers via Messenger, but there may be friction there with users actually welcoming unsolicited contact. There is a lot of potential in that medium, but the challenge will be scaling up those products based on user adoption. Messenger will be a key opportunity for businesses looking to increase customer service. Using bots instead of customer-service centers would be extremely cost-efficient. VP of partnerships Kyle Benedetti: Messenger represents one of Facebook’s biggest opportunities for 2017. It will be interesting to see bots’ presences grow and how advertisers will use them to interact with customers in a way that is not intrusive. Huff: Brands can’t afford to ignore that fact that an increasing number of consumers are migrating to messenger apps such as Facebook Messenger, Slack and WhatsApp. Therefore, I expect to see marketing and advertising opportunities arise in this space. 2017 will be the year of greater paid social platform diversity and also the rise of messenger app marketing. Virtual reality Benedetti: Virtual reality will continue to evolve, but not necessarily to practical purposes yet. Eventually, Facebook Workplace and Oculus have the potential to intersect and connect businesses by getting people more or less in the same room, but for now, Oculus is just a fun way to explore a new medium. All of the big players are moving into VR, so we can expect to see bigger and more practical advances take shape in 2017. Pinterest VP of product Kristen Donnino: Of all the walled gardens, Pinterest has truly carved out a definitive and unique niche for itself as a search and discovery platform, and I see its trajectory as really nailing down the best way to approach the consumer purchasing journey. People come to the platform searching for something, so Pinterest’s greatest value is making that something–be it a sweater, a lamp, a hotel stay or a recipe–easy to attain. Privacy/security/fraud/regulations Sethi: Privacy and security are going to continue to be big concerns in 2017, primarily because we can expect to see the number of hacks to increase. It seems like every day, a new site is hacked and the credentials of millions of users are leaked. This uncertainty may lead to people to fear their behavior being tracked online. If users start opting out of letting advertisers understand their full purchase journey, which is the holy grail for advertisers, that will affect their ability to provide full-funnel marketing solutions. There is a lot of fraud going on at the moment, and we can expect to see the government get involved to start cracking down on this because it does hurt the consumer in many ways. This fraud will ultimately have a positive effect on the world of paid social as it will move dollars toward environments that are more transparent. Transparency will win at the end of the day. A potential benefit to President-elect Donald Trump getting his way with moving foreign capital back to the U.S. will be that companies could suddenly potentially have billions more dollars to spend, and that will put a lot of the juice and muscle back into marketing. That juice could also change the initial-public-offering market for these companies and potentially create a better market than the current, lackluster ad tech IPO market. There is a new wave of companies getting ready to go public that represent stronger, more profitable businesses. If they do go public next year and do well, that will change the whole investment cycle in ad tech and hopefully push more money in, which means more innovation, more startups, more jobs–better solutions for marketers, basically.

The iPhone maker listed hiring notices for 15 positions dated Thursday on its website, including a store leader and business manager. The listings did not specify the exact location or when those who are hired will begin working. "We're excited about opening our first Apple Store in Korea, one of the world's economic centers and a leader in telecommunication and technology, with a vibrant K-culture," Apple told Reuters in a statement Friday. "We're now hiring the team that will offer our customers in Seoul the service, education and entertainment that is loved by Apple customers around the world." Apple declined to comment on where in Seoul its retail store would be or when it would open. But South Korea's Yonhap News Agency said in a report on Friday that construction was underway for the store at a location in a southern district of Seoul and that the work will likely be completed by end-November.

New leaks suggest that the handset - thought to be called the iPhone 8 - will feature wireless charging technology, removing the need for a physical cable. Steve Rizzone, chief executive of Energous, has dropped heavy hints that his company will be providing wireless charging technology for Apple's next mobile device. In an interview with The Verge, he revealed that Energous has signed a "key strategic partnership" with "one of the largest consumer electronic companies in the world". Apple removed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 (Photo: Reuters/Beck Diefenbach) Although Rizzone did not name the partner, it is widely suspected to be Apple. "I cannot tell you who it is, but I can virtual guarantee that you have products from this company on your person, sitting on your desk, or at home," said Rizzone. Until now, wireless charging has tended to rely on charging plates, meaning devices cannot be moved while powering up. However, Energous's WattUp technology uses special power units placed strategically around the home or office to charge devices over–the–air from a distance of as much as 15 feet. Energous's WattUp technology doesn't require a charging pad This potentially means that Apple's next generation of iPhones could be charging constantly while inside the building, without interrupting usage. This is not the first time wireless charging has been rumoured as a feature for the iPhone 8 . A report in Bloomberg last year claimed that Apple was working on "cutting edge" wireless technology that would allow future iPhones and iPads to be placed further away from charging mats than current smartphones. The unnamed sources said Apple was working on overcoming "technical barriers including loss of power over distance," and that the technology will feature in iPhones coming out in 2017. Some of Samsung's smartphones already charge wirelessly (Photo: Samsung) Following the removal of the headphone jack with the iPhone 7 in 2016, the addition of wireless charging could see Apple launch a smartphone with no ports or sockets at all in September. This would force all iPhone owners to use wireless headphones to listen to music or podcasts. The device would most likely come bundled with Apple's AirPod earphones. Other rumours suggest that Apple's iPhone 8 will be made entirely from glass and come in three size options. At least one of these is thought to feature a curved OLED display , similar to Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge, and boast 4K resolution. Apple is also rumoured to be getting rid of the physical Home button and replacing it with a touch-sensitive digital button. Eye-scanning technology is also rumoured, as well as a dual-lens camera on all three models.

(Reuters/Kim Kyung Hoon) Share Written by Josh Horwitz Obsession China's Transition January 04, 2017 Apple is ringing in the new year in China with the censors knocking on its doors. The California-based tech giant has removed the New York Times from its app store in China, reports the paper (paywall). The move is the latest indication of a broader government crackdown on the media, and of pressure on Apple itself. The Times reports that the app ceased to show up in the app store on Dec. 23. When the paper asked about its disappearance, Apple said it had “been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations.” Apple did not specify which regulations it had violated when asked by the Times and Quartz. Even before its removal, the newspaper’s app didn’t always function properly from within China. Viewing content often required getting online through a proxy service like a virtual private network (VPN). And since 2012 authorities have blocked direct access (paywall) to paper’s website, forcing readers to use either a VPN or “mirror sites” prone to disappearing as quickly as they surfaced. Authorities seem to be singling out the New York Times. Apps for the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times remain downloadable, despite their websites also being blocked from within China. And while China’s censors sometimes act arbitrarily, in the case of the New York Times their timing seems intentional. The app’s removal came days before the paper published a lengthy piece (paywall) from reporter David Barboza revealing how the Chinese government provided billions of dollars in subsidies to Foxconn, Apple’s manufacturing partner, in order to help produce the iPhone. Their blocking of the paper’s website in 2012 came just as Barboza published a piece about the hidden wealth of then-premier Wen Jiabao. As for Apple, this isn’t the first time it’s bowed to Chinese authorities over media matters. In April 2016, the company confirmed that the government asked it to shutter its iBooks and iTunes stores (it complied). And it disabled its Apple News service for all users in China, even if their accounts were established in another country. The government has tightened its control over the media in recent years. In 2015, it passed regulations restricting the activities of foreign internet media companies, TV studios, game developers, and livestreaming operations. Apple’s revenue from China has experienced negative annual growth over the past nine months. Last quarter, sales from Greater China (which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan) fell behind those of Europe for the first time since 2014. Barboza’s article on Foxconn illustrated how the Chinese government can help a company’s fortunes. The converse is true, too. As iPhone sales fall globally and Apple searches for its next hit product, it needs the support of Chinese authorities to succeed in the world’s largest consumer market. That might require publicity tours and strategic investments—as well as painful choices about censorship. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search Post to Cancel

Simon Erickson and Dylan Lewis (TMFInnovator) Jan 6, 2017 at 7:48AM On our last 2016 episode of Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and Simon Erickson preview what investors can expect in the tech space in 2017. Find out why they think wearable technology will enjoy some new growth avenues, what will probably happen with smart home devices, why M&A might die down from its peak in 2015. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Dec. 23, 2016. Dylan Lewis: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Friday, December 23rd, and we're looking forward to what 2017 has in store for tech. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined in studio by Motley Fool premium analyst Simon Erickson. Simon, how's it going? Simon Erickson: Great, Dylan. Thanks very much for having me. Lewis: What are your holiday plans? Erickson: Heading back down to my home state of Texas, where it will be much warmer than up here in Alexandria. Lewis: I'm doing the opposite. I'm going further north where it will be colder, in New Jersey. Erickson: I wish you the best of luck. Lewis: It's going to be a little rough. This is our last show for 2016. Next week, we're actually going to be reairing some of our favorite episodes from the past year, to fill the gap between Christmas and the New Year's holiday. Simon, I was tempted to do the show where we surprised John Rotonti with your posed listener question, ultimately wound up going with something I shot with David Kretzmann about stock-based compensation. It seemed a little bit more relevant. But that was a good time. We should do that again. Erickson: I'm pretty sure my accent completely gave me away. It was really a terrible accent I tried for John, and I think he was on to me. Lewis: Because he couldn't see you, he could only hear this wild, hackneyed accent asking him a question about why it's wrong, about value investing, I think? Erickson: I think so. Lewis: But, yeah, since this is our last new show of the year, I thought maybe we would look forward to 2017, give listeners an idea of some of the things that we're watching in tech for this upcoming year. I know one thing that you're really hot on is wearable technology, and it possibly morphing beyond the traditional consumer electronics market, right? Erickson: I think that my first prediction is that wearable devices are going to look much more like medical devices in the coming year or two. We've gotten accustomed to Fitbits tracking our steps, maybe telling us a little bit about how we sleep, and a lot of fitness tracking that is kind of interesting and useful. But they're expanding how these can be used beyond just fitness. I think we're going to start seeing that more, because the real money for this is going to be coming from insurers. Insurers are going to want to see more functionality than just how many steps you're taking or what they're doing today.  And we're starting to see some of that already. We've seen now Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) work with Medtronic for type 2 diabetes to monitor blood sugar and things like this. I think that's going to be my first prediction -- you're going to start seeing a lot more of that where it's more specific applications, but it's going to be tied to insurance reimbursements. Lewis: Because really, for the insurers, more data is better. They want as much as they can to help build out some of the actuarial tables and some of the pricing for a lot of the plans they're going to be offering. In terms of better understanding patient outcomes and best treatments, there's a lot of applications there as well. Erickson: We just went to the ConnectedHealth conference here in D.C. just a couple of weeks ago and found out that about 40% of your health is based on behavior, which is very interesting, what are you eating, how active are you, what are you doing out there? And I think that plays into the wearable technology trend. You just have to get to where the money is in this industry. I think that really is from the insurers. Lewis: I think very often, people can be blind to things that are automated and rote for them because they're just humming in the background. It's a decision that they don't even realize they're making. You have some of these wearables that can help identify that in a big data step back type of way, and that can be very compelling for the insurance and healthcare market. Erickson: Absolutely. Lewis: Another area I know you're watching is how some big tech titans will be focusing on the cloud, and it sounds like the smart home market as well. Erickson: We have Alexa in our home right now -- Lewis: And actually, our podcasts have an integration with Alexa. Erickson: You can actually ask them to play our podcasts, right? Lewis: Yeah, if you feel like doing that some time. Erickson: Getting smarter, right? The Amazon Echo, which is what we refer to as Alexa here, is already a hardware device that was launched in 2015, collecting data for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to facilitate more e-commerce transactions. Now, this last year, we saw Google Home introduce their own hardware competing product, so they can get more information on what you're searching for and what you're wanting to do, which, of course, can drive advertising. We've seen that Jeff Bezos has said he has 1,000 employees working on Amazon Echo right now. Lewis: That's insane. Erickson: It's really crazy to think about. They've sold 5 million of these already earlier this year. So, this is a really big project for a really big company, and an innovative visionary leader that's not afraid to put money behind some of his best ideas. I really think that not only Amazon but also Google, also Microsoft, also Facebook, are wanting to collect more and more data that you're giving it in your living room, so that they can supplement and improve their businesses. Lewis: And it seems like a lot of these hardware solutions are really reducing the friction that users have with getting whatever it is that they're searching for, whether it be a podcast, like one of The Motley Fool podcasts, or maybe it's an answer on what the weather is like, or something like that. But, a lot of time, it's ease of use. You look at something like Google's original search algorithm and how that brought the entire tech landscape and navigating the web into something that is simple and easy to find. A lot of what these smart home and more integrated solutions we're seeing from big tech names are doing is something similar, is a next layer on top of that, as I'm seeing at least. Erickson: Yeah, I completely agree with you. We've seen them launch the product first and then optimize it over time second, basically strategy model of these. Amazon wanted to get the Echo out, get it in your home. And it's not going to be able to do everything up front. In fact, it was very limited when they first launched it, but it's getting smarter. It's able to do more and more things. And I think in the future, we're going to see that more and more being based on transactions, rather than just playing music or asking what the temperature is, "Book me an Uber" or "Reorder me something on Amazon." I think that's the next wave that Amazon is going forward, and Google is going after a lot of data as well. Lewis: One of the things I thought was really interesting. I was talking with Fool.com writer Daniel Kline about this. He's a gadget head, loves everything, owns everything. He'll buy it so he can write an article about it -- he's that kind of guy. He said Amazon was very smart with what they've done with Echo, because they have started out with very limited functionality, and they nailed the execution on that functionality. Rather than maybe what we've seen with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)and Siri and some of those other assistant-style things, where the execution was wonky because it tried to do too much. So, it'll be interesting to see how these different tech companies, from a functionality perspective, and all the features they allow here, continue to develop that, because it seems like Amazon has been smart there in slowly rolling it out and building a ton of confidence in the capabilities of the device and the underlying software and then adding things as they're able to execute for users.  Erickson: Yeah, and it's a race right now. Do you really need to have Alexa and Google Home and everything else in your home? You probably don't. Maybe you could have them talk to each other and have an interesting conversation. But really, this is almost a winner-takes-all for your living room, which I think is very beneficial for whoever sells the most hardware devices. They're really going to win the data prize at the end. Lewis: Switching gears here, I know one thing that we're both very interested in is tech mergers and acquisitions, and what that might look like in 2017. There are a couple different factors that I think might play into this. Some numbers from Dealogic: According to their estimates, global technology targeted M&A in 2014 was around $300 billion. In 2015, it was nearly $700 billion. Year to date in 2016, it's around $530 billion. For context, 2006 to 2013, total M&A wasn't above $300 billion once. My projection here is that we will see tech M&A be more or less flat from 2016, maybe even go down. I don't think we're going to revisit that huge peak we had in 2015. A couple different factors here on my end. Do you have any thoughts on that? Erickson: Money's cheap. Lewis: Money's cheap. Erickson: What's the interest rate looked like the last several years, you know? Lewis: Exactly. Last week, the Fed announced it was raising rates for the second time in 10 years. Now, the federal funds rate, which is the baseline rate for overnight bank borrowing, is at 75 basis points (0.75%), which is up from 50 basis points. Fed officials indicated that they would be possibly interested in making up to three increases next year, which would obviously be more aggressive than they'd originally forecast. The market wasn't quite expecting that. Also, they project three hikes in 2018 and 2019. All of this is to say, it will probably get more expensive to borrow. Capital is not going to be as cheap as it has been in the past. I think that will make some of these acquisitions a little tougher, because very often they're financed by debt by some of these big companies. Erickson: It's an interesting dynamic. I would say, right now if you go back to the early 2000s, it was all about getting a website. First, we had pets.com and every other dot-com that you could possibly get out there because the internet was blossoming. Then, you look maybe seven or eight years after that, and it was all about mobile, and everybody wanted to be an app that was on your smartphone that you could access, and that was just completely the new business model. I think now we're actually kind of slowing down on producing new things, because we have kind of overwhelmed what consumers can reliably handle, as far as websites and apps. I think it's going to be much more about, how are they useful, and who's consolidating that data? I think that's the third phase of the internet we're about to start experiencing. Lewis: I think one of the other things that might play into what we see with M&A moving forward is, a lot of people look at the market right now and they see that it's fairly expensive, in historical terms. You look at the S&P 500's trailing P/E, it's in the mid to upper mid-20s. That's on the higher end when you look back over the past 90 years. Historically, it's high single digits to low 20s, with some outliers here and there. Obviously, these are all broad-stroke macro factors, and none of this scares me away from buying any individual companies. But it's good to be aware of the general atmosphere surrounding the market. I don't think you will continue to see the consolidation that you've seen, particularly in spaces like the semiconductor industry and things like that, simply because it's going to be more expensive to borrow, and valuations have already been pushed up because it's been so inexpensive to borrow for such a long time. There is a wrench, possibly, that could get thrown into this thought process. Erickson: Here we go. Lewis: You want to deliver it? This is your theory. The potential for a tax holiday could be a little bit disruptive with this line of thinking, right? Erickson: That's the wrench that gets thrown into the plan. The gloves are off, what's going to happen, if all of the sudden you can repatriate these billions of dollars that tech companies have had overseas into the U.S. for a reduced rate? That could change the entire dynamic, probably. Lewis: You wouldn't need the debt to be able to finance these types of acquisitions. Not that it would be a problem for a company like Apple or Microsoft to do that. But these are two companies that I believe 90% of their cash hoard is held overseas. For them to bring that back under current tax law, they would be taking a huge haircut to do it. So, they've been harvesting that money overseas, and basically just letting it sit in marketable securities. But, if they are granted a one-time special tax holiday by president elect Trump, obviously that would make it a lot easier for more deals to go through. Erickson: Would that make America great again? Lewis: It might. I don't know. It's hard for me to know. I am no politico. I am just a guy they decided to give a weekly podcast to. Erickson: Well, I'm glad that you started the reckless predictions for this. I do think the interesting part is, obviously, Trump has campaigned a lot about establishing jobs in America. Of course, tech is a huge source of jobs in this country. So, a tax holiday could theoretically provide a lot of that for him. Lewis: Yeah. And, I mean, to show his emphasis on the tech industry, they had that tech summit, was that last week? A lot of execs were there. I know Tim Cook was there. So, he's clearly appealing to that group of executives and that industry. It will be interesting to see what the follow-through is there. Obviously, like we said, it's something that could disrupt that process, and that line of thinking with M&A trajectories. But, something we won't know for sure, and just have to watch. Erickson: Indeed. Lewis: Any other things to watch for 2017? Anything on your dashboard? Erickson: Well, I have two reckless predictions for M&A. Lewis: Love it!  Erickson: This is the crystal that is always cloudy. We never know where it's actually going to hit or not. But just for the show, for you, Dylan, I came up with to reckless predictions of M&A acquisition that I could see happening in the future. Lewis: I appreciate that. And emphasis on reckless. Erickson: Yes. And any hate mail from our listeners, directly to your inbox, right? Lewis: Yes. That's dlewis@fool.com. Or industryfocus@fool.com, if you feel like hitting all of us! Erickson: These are, again, highly speculative. I don't recommend anybody go out and buy these based on this. But two things that I do see that are very interesting out there: My first reckless prediction in the tech M&A space is IBM (NYSE:IBM) acquiring Splunk. The reason being, IBM has been a company that has shown it's willing to change its business model so many times. It's reinvented itself so many times over the decades, successfully. And it recognizes in the healthcare space, in all of the spaces that Watson is playing in right now, it has to look at unstructured data. It has to look at the fuller context of what's going on in the data that we're trying to figure out X outcome to come out of. The leader right now, far and away, in unstructured data, is Splunk. IBM is trying to use Watson to improve the outcomes of the healthcare space. So, I would make that reckless prediction No. 1 in the M&A space. Lewis: All right, what's reckless prediction No. 2? Erickson: No. 2 is Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) buys Veeva Systems. Again, you have a non-compete clause here with Veeva having exclusive rights to the life sciences and healthcare industry, whereas Salesforce is focused on almost everything else for software as a service, improving sales efficiencies, and actually, Veeva's CEO came from Salesforce.com, has a great relationship with those guys, and is actually using Salesforce to power along the back-end architecture for that company. I think they've carved out a very profitable niche, and they've kept that great relationship with Salesforce. I think that's a natural fit, potentially, for the future. Lewis: I love that those were your two, because two that came to mind for me, these are companies we have discussed fairly recently on the Tech podcast, Twitter and Pandora. Very curious to see what happens with them in 2017, because Twitter, of course, went through that flurry of headlines about potentially being suited by, Salesforce was one of them, Marc Benioff, their CEO, seemed enamored with Twitter. But I know Disney was in the conversation at some point, I believe Microsoft was in the conversation at some point. It seemed like anyone with a decent amount of cash on hand was in the conversation. And Pandora recently in chats, potentially, with Sirius. I know there has been some speculation there, too. David Kretzmann and I did a show on them a couple weeks ago. So, I'm glad to see that you're bringing some fresh perspectives, those are truly reckless predictions, and ones that maybe a lot of people aren't thinking about right now. Erickson: Sure. Lewis: Glad to have you on. Anything else before I let you go, Simon? Erickson: I think that's it. We're obviously keeping a very close eye on the tech space in Motley Fool Explorer, and also MDP and Rule Breakers. It's an interesting time to be a tech investor. We've seen the valuations a lot higher than we've been used to. On the other side, these companies are doing some pretty innovative stuff out there.

Updated in January 2017 with two new features; see below. Also see: Best Fitness Tracker Deals The Fitbit Blaze is an attractive watch, but at its heart it's a sophisticated activity tracker that boasts not just multisport options but smartphone Caller ID, calendar and text display functions. Now read our Fitbit Charge 2 review. Read next: Which Fitbit is best? Fitbit Blaze hands-on review: Pricing and availability The Fitbit Blaze, with choice of Clasic strap size (S, L, XL) and colour, costs £159.99, and was released in March 2016. Additional Classic straps are priced at £19.99 each. Leather straps cost £59.99 each, and the Metal Link bracelet will set you back £89.99. These straps are interchangeable, so you can dress up the tracker as you desire. Fitbit Blaze - £159.99 / US$199.95 / €239.95 - view today’s best prices on Amazon. For more detailed reviews of each Fitbit activity tracker go to our dedicated review pages, listed below. We also compare the Blaze to the other Fitbits towards the end of this review. Fitbit One review  |  Fitbit Zip review  |  Fitbit Flex 2 review  |  Fitbit Alta review  |   Fitbit Charge 2 review  |  Fitbit Blaze Review  |  Fitbit Surge review Fitbit Blaze review: Design and build The Fitbit Blaze tracker itself is a small black square featuring a touchscreen, and is slotted into an octagonal frame and strap of your choosing.The only other Fitbits to work in this way are the Alta and Flex 2, and each gives you more varied options than you get with other Fitbit trackers. You order the Blaze with a standard Black, Blue or Plum "Classic Band", but you can add either Metal or Leather wriststraps in various colours. There's not the varied range you get with the Apple Watch, but there's enough choice to distinguish you from the usual tracker crowd. See also: Fitbit vs Apple Watch There are also two special-edition Blaze models: the £179.99 Gunmetal Blaze and the £189.99 Slim Pink Blaze. There’s a small gap between the body of the watch and the frame at the top and bottom, and while it’s unusual looking, we like how it looks on the wrist. It’s fairly lightweight, and the classic strap is particularly soft to touch. The Fitbit Blaze features three physical buttons; one on the left of the watch, and two on the right. The left button is essentially a Back button, and the remaining two buttons are contextual, performing different actions depending on what app you’ve got open. You don’t have to use the buttons very much though, as the Blaze is touch and swipe enabled. We would have preferred the option to swipe back from the stats screen to the clock, but the Back button works just fine. The Blaze weighs 43g, which is lighter than the Fitbit Surge (52g) but heavier than the simpler Charge HR (26g). Read next: 20 best fitness trackers of 2017 Fitbit Blaze review: Fitness features What sets the Fitbit Blaze apart from the rest of the Fitbit collection is its colourful screen and strap collection, but it shares most of the functions enjoyed by the other Fitbits. All Fitbits have a MEMS 3-axis accelerometer that measures motion patterns to determine your steps taken, distance travelled, active minutes, and calories burned. Steps is the measure most people find motivating (and it's how you measure your activity versus friends in the leaderboard), but you can also set yourself goals for the other metrics if you wish. Its altimeter measures the number of floors climbed; every 10 feet of elevation counts as one "floor". This altimeter is a sensor that calculates altitude based on atmospheric pressure. We have noted rather erratic altitude performance on other Fitbits, and strange results can becaused by other environmental factors. Like the Fitbit Alta and Charge 2 the Blaze features Reminders to Move, which help keep you active with hourly mini-goals. Fitbit Blaze review: Heart Rate The Fitbit Blaze features Fitbit’s proprietary PurePulse optical heart-rate technology, which uses safe LED lights on the underside of the wristband to detect blood volume and capillary-size changes under pressure. When your heart beats, your capillaries expand and contract based on blood volume changes. PurePulse LED lights on the Blaze reflect onto the skin to detect blood volume changes. You can see your heart rate right on your wrist, which is better than having to refer to the app as you have to with other trackers, and there's no need to strap on a heart monitor to your chest. Heart rate measurement is great for the more active fitness enthusiast, as it will help you plan how to burn energy/calories quicker by maximising training, and maintain intensity during workouts. It is also helpful for everyone as a way to analyse all-day and resting heart rate trends. Cardio Fitness Level provides a snapshot of your cardiovascular fitness. Based on estimated VO2 Max – calculated by your user profile, heart rate and exercise data – this lets you see how your fitness level relates to others of the same age and gender, and get guidance on how to improve over time. Fitbit Blaze review: Sleep measurement As well as these activity records the Blaze measures and monitors your sleep patterns, noting when you're properly asleep, awake or merely restless; see app screen above. Doctors warn that a good night's sleep has as much effect on your overall health as an active lifestyle, so keeping an eye on your sleep patterns is another key to staying fit and healthy, both physically and mentally. While we like the look of the Metal Links bracelet for the Blaze, we do wonder whether you'd want to sleep with it on. You could easily swap to the Classic strap (included with all Blaze purchases) at night. You can also set "silent" alarms that buzz you awake at set times, supposedly without waking your bed partner. In truth that buzz does make a small sound, but it's certainly more considerate than a ringing or buzzing alarm clock. You can choose between four different clock faces, none as whimsical as those offered by the quirkier Apple Watch, but a varied enough selection for most. Fitbit Blaze review: Smart notifications and Music Control The Fitbit Blaze also features push notifications from your Bluetooth-connected device (iPhone, Android, Windows Phone). The Blaze offers Call, text and calendar notifications. This doesn't make it a "smartwatch" as it lacks all the apps those watches can access, and Fitbit is keen to stress that it's a "Fitness Watch" rather than a "Smartwatch". It's smarter than your average watch, however, and matches the best of the trackers with an attractive timepiece. All notifications are automatically removed each day and individual notifications can be deleted by swiping right when displayed. You can control your smartphone's music playlist (including apps like Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, and podcasts) using Music Control, even during workouts. You press and hold the upper right button for Music Control, and use the lower right button to see notifications. Fitbit Blaze review: SmartTrack, Multisport and FitStar SmartTrack automatically recognizes and records select exercises (Walking, Running, Outdoor biking, Elliptical) to ensure you get credit for your most active moments of the day. Whenever you wear your tracker and participate in any continuous, high-movement activity of 15 minutes or more, your tracker will recognize and identify your activity and automatically record it for you. To check your stats, look at your exercise history after syncing your tracker.  SmartTrack also recognizes two general categories. High-movement sports like tennis, basketball, football are automatically recognised, but sports without continuous movement (eg. golf) won’t be. Aerobic workouts with continuous movement, such as Zumba, cardio-kickboxing, and other dance classes, are also recognised. By default, SmartTrack recognizes an exercise that lasts at least 15 minutes. You can lower this setting to 10 minutes, or increase it as high as 90 minutes. SmartTrack is perfect for those times when you go for a long run or a walk and forget to activate the tracking software. That being said, if you manually select your type of exercise you get a much more accurate reading than if it was automatically detected. Of course, you don't need to set anything to get your normal, everyday walking tracked. SmartTrack is for longer bursts of activity you want more detail on. Automatic exercise monitoring shows you the key health stats during that period of activity, including three heart-rate zone (moderate Fat Burn; high-intensity Cardio; and push-to-max Peak). SmartTrack doesn't record GPS data, provide real-time stats on your wrist, or provide distance and pace information in your exercise history. For those features use the Multisport mode. If you want to track precise exercise stats you can tell your tracker when exercise starts and stops. Depending on the tracker you’ll see real-time stats on your wrist, a workout summary when exercise stops, The FitStar menu on Fitbit Blaze provides three guided workouts right on your wrist: Warm It Up (8 minutes); 7-Minute Workout; 10-Minute Abs. At the end of the session, you’ll see a review of your workout that includes calories burned, average heart rate, max heart rate, and workout duration. Each workout is free and can be accessed at any time with no app or smartphone required. Fitbit Blaze review: Relax Guided Breathing Fitbit's Relax Guided Breathing mode can help calm your body and mind through either two- and five-minute sessions personalised to your breathing rate. This is supposed to reduce stress and anxiety, as well as lower blood pressure. Fitbit Blaze review: GPS Unlike the Fitbit Surge, the Fitbit Blaze doesn't have a built-in GPS, so you need your mobile phone nearby to use the Connected Exercise feature to properly measure distance and speed/pace. Blaze uses your smartphone's GPS to map your routes and deliver real-time activity stats such as distance and pace during your walks, runs, and bike rides.After each workout, stats sync wirelessly to the Fitbit dashboard to let you review your route, speed and elevation in more detail. Fitbit Blaze review: battery life and charger Depending on how many times you access the display the Blaze can last as long as five days on a single charge. If you keep looking at the display, swiping through the faces, using the stopwatch, and so on, then the battery while not keep going as long. FitStar workouts, for example, are battery intensive. Rest assured, however, that it will last longer than the Apple Watch! For some reason Fitbit has a different proprietary charger for every single one of its trackers, and the Blaze is no exception. Rather like the Flex 2 you remove the actual tracker from the strap to charge. It then fits into a small square box, which you plug in to a power source via USB. We'd love Fitbit to move to a universal charger. There's few worse fears for a Fitbit user than a dead battery, and if your charger is at home, the office or wherever you are not then you risk losing step count while uncharged. Fitbit Blaze review: Blaze vs other Fitbits The Blaze doesn't do anything that other Fitbits can't, except link up with FitStar functions. Like the Fitbit Charge 2 and Surge it measures heart rate. It shares its Caller ID and text notifications with the Charge 2, Alta and Surge. Only the Blaze and Surge feature a Music Control feature. So why pick the Blaze? It offers more of a standalone "watch" design, although you could argue the Surge does the same, although nowhere near as colourful. Also, you could easily use the Alta or Charge 2 as a watch in its own right. Like the Surge, the Blaze is aimed at more serious fitness through its multisport features, although auto-exercise recognition is also available on the Alta and Charge 2. We think people will choose the Blaze over other Fitbits because of its attractive watch-like design, colour display, strap choices, and extra fitness features. If you want GPS built in you need the Surge, but few of us exercise without our phones on us for music or keeping in touch with the rest of the lazy world, so the Blaze can be connected to your mobile's GPS instead. Fitbit Blaze or Apple Watch? Read our Fitbit vs Apple Watch article for more comparison. Fitbit Blaze review: app As with all the Fitbits, you can monitor your stats on your wrist via the Blaze's touch screen, and also on the great mobile app (iOS, Android, Windows Phone), and Fitbit's desktop Dashboard. The graphs and charts, plus historical data are great to monitor your progress. Fitbit Blaze review: Friends, Badges and Challenges We love Fitbit's Friends leaderboard, where you link up with other Fitbit users as an incentive to go that extra step (or 10,000 steps) through daily competition. You can also challenge (and be challenged) on various daily or weekly battles with your Fitbit friends. All of this, of course, is entirely voluntary. You can maintain a solitary regime, but it's more fun to do it with like-minded friends. Fitbit has recently added a bunch of new Community features, including Feed and Groups. For more details see our Which Fitbit feature. As you progress and pass various step and climb milestones Fitbit rewards you with fun virtual badges. You also gain badges during each week as you hit targets and surpass them. Fitbit Blaze review: straps, sizes and styles The Blaze is hugely customisable, with a variety of straps available in a number of colours; the Luxe collection consists of either a silver metal link bracelet, or a premium leather band, and the Classic collection features three standard Blaze straps in Black, Blue and Plum. The Metal Link bracelet is only available in Silver, whereas you can purchase Black, Camel or Mist Grey leather straps and black, blue and purple classic straps. The choice of design allows users to wear the Blaze wherever they go, instead of just at the gym. It’s easy to switch between the straps too, as you just pop out the body and slot it into a different frame. When buying the Blaze you need to choose the colour of the Classic Band you desite, even if you are buying a Leather or Metal strap as well. You also need to choose from three sizes. Small fits wrists 140 - 170mm (5.5 - 6.7 inches); Large fits wrists 170 - 206mm (6.7 – 8.1 inches); and X-Large fits wrists 206 - 236mm (8.1 – 9.3 inches).

Like all the Fitbits it's a great activity tracker, supported by a fantastic app and desktop dashboard, as well as an eco-system of competition with friends, collaborative challenges, badges and rewards to keep you motivated. If you're after a stylish watch that is packed with advanced fitness features the Blaze stands apart from the competition. Its colourful display is fun, and its fitness stats seriously good for your health.

Tongo/European Pressphoto Agency) Apple rang in the new year with some good news: the first day of 2017 marked the highest daily sales ever for App Stores. The company took in $240 million from app purchases on Jan. 1 through its app platform App Store, according to a news release published Thursday. That's after a year of record-breaking subscriptions and downloads, “generating over $20 billion for developers,” the company said. Apple's App Store got about half of the downloads of its main competitor Google Play in 2016, yet it brought in twice the revenue in the third quarter, according to app analytics firm App Annie. The numbers were similar for the rest of 2016. Apple also had an uptick in subscription billings, a 74 percent increase from last year that came in at $2.7 billion total. One reason might be the relative affluence of Apple iPhone owners compared to Android users given the higher price of their devices, which typically correlates with higher spending, said Danielle Levitas, senior vice president of research at App Annie. “I think the most surprising thing is just how strong Apple's revenue lead is and how it continues to beat the market's growth,” Levitas said. She added that the kinds of apps published on the platform range from games to e-commerce, entertainment and banking, meaning that a wide breadth of companies are gaining exposure. “It's not just about app store revenue but rather increased engagement with apps in terms of time spent.” Sales in China, Japan, the United States and Britain brought in the most revenue for the App Store. Downloads from Chinese users in particular boomed, increasing by 90 percent from last year, according to Apple. That's despite slowing device sales, MarketWatch reported. [Apple pulls New York Times app from China] “Pokémon Go” was the most downloaded app last year. Other popular downloads included “Super Mario Run” as well as subscription based apps such as Netflix and HBO Go. Last year's introduction of iMessage apps, directly integrated into iOS's messaging platform to allow users to send stickers and play games via chat, accounted for 21,000 new apps on the App Store. “The fact that Apple continues to grow its installed base and gain dollars per user is very impressive,” Levitas said. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

By Oliver Cragg January 6, 2017 12:59 GMT Apple is recruiting staff for its first retail store in South KoreaReuters Apple has chosen a location for its first South Korean retail store, in a move that sees the Cupertino company boldly setting up shop in the very heart of Samsung's homeland. In a statement, Apple confirmed that it is recruiting staff members for a new Apple Store, to be built in the capital city of Seoul. While Apple has previously sold iPhones, Macs and iPads in South Korea through third-party resellers and via its online store, the new store will be the first official Apple retail outlet in the country. The exact spot for the store has yet to be confirmed, but it appears it will be constructed in the city's Southern district. At time of writing, a total of 14 job vacancies for the planned store are listed on Apple's website, including management roles, Genius bar advisers and service specialists. "We're excited about opening our first Apple Store in Korea, one of the world's economic centres and a leader in telecommunication and technology, with a vibrant K-culture," read the statement (via Reuters). "We're now hiring the team that will offer our customers in Seoul the service, education and entertainment that is loved by Apple customers around the world." A recent report from AppleInsider claimed that Apple was considering several locations around the city, with the Gangam and Garosu-gil districts noted as potential sites for the company's next global expansion in the retail sector. The same report also suggested that the store could open its doors by November. Should Apple muscle its way into Seoul's southern districts, the new store would be just 13 miles away from "Samsung Digital City" in Suwon − a large campus that contains Samsung's main headquarters across four towering office blocks and over 100 smaller buildings. Samsung noted that the site boasted around 35,000 employees as of 2014.

But what exactly can China's government do? According to a Bloomberg report, there are several options at China's disposal. For instance, the Chinese government could subject large U.S. companies or those with high exposure to China to a tax or an antitrust probe. Bloomberg highlighted a sample of companies with high revenue exposure to the Chinese market, including Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ: WYNN) at 60 percent, QUALCOMM, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) at 57 percent, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MU) at 43 percent and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) at 22 percent. Other options the Chinese government could explore and implement include the launch of anti-dumping investigations along with a reduction in government purchases of products made by American companies. Bloomberg, citing "people familiar with the matter" noted that China's government has already compiled a list of retaliatory actions. However, it will only become official government policy if the Trump administration acts first and the most senior leaders within China's government sign off on the plans. For the time being, China believes diplomacy will prevail. Speaking to Bloomberg, China's Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen said U.S. and China relations have helped employ many people in both countries and generated tremendous wealth for individuals and businesses. "I believe win-win economic ties between the two nations will keep moving forward," Wang said. "No one wants a lose-lose scenario, and no one will want to harm the win-win ties. I'm still optimistic about future China-U.S. economic relations." Posted-In: China Donald Trump US China RelationsRumors Global Markets Media Best of Benzinga © 2017 Benzinga.com.

Picture: Beck Diefenbach San Francisco - Apple unveiled an iPhone 7 with high-resolution cameras and no headphone jack at its annual launch event on Wednesday, though the biggest surprise was the debut of a three-decade-old Nintendo game franchise, Super Mario Bros, on the smartphone. While shares of Apple barely budged, Nintendo's US-listed shares jumped 29 percent on investors' hopes that Super Mario would be another mobile gaming hit for the Japanese company akin to the wildly popular Pokemon GO. Much of the presentation headed by Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook was devoted to technical details of photography, wireless earphones, games from Nintendo, and a new version of Apple watch - with fitness features. The biggest iPhone technical improvements all had leaked, and Apple itself spoiled the surprise by sending out tweets of some details before Cook spoke. The company then deleted the messages. Apple has reported declines in iPhone sales for the last two quarters, which raised the stakes for the iPhone 7. Some consumers and analysts are considering waiting until 2017. “Just gonna wait on iPhone 8 cuz it's the 10th anniversary of iPhone,” tweeted @LewBruh near the end of the event. “Ya know they gonna do something big.” But Mike Binger, senior portfolio manager at Gradient Investments in Minneapolis, said the new phone encouraged him that Apple was in good shape for a new sales cycle. “I think the iPhone 7, just from a replacement basis, will be a successful launch,” he said. The world's best-known technology company said the iPhone 7 would have one, zooming 12-megapixel camera. Starting at $649, it is the same price as the 6S predecessor. The larger 7 'Plus' edition, starting at $769, would feature two cameras, including a telephoto lens. Apple also removed the analogue headphone jack from both new models, as was widely expected. The new headphones supplied by Apple with the phone will plug into the same port as the recharging cord, making it incompatible with most wired headphones without an adaptor. Apple includes the adapter. The phones will also work with Apple's new wireless headphones, called Air Pods, available in late October at a price of $159. The disappearance of the headphone jack “will probably annoy a certain amount of people” but they would likely get over it, Binger said. Apple described dropping the jack as an act of courage as it moved toward a wireless future with the optional Air Pods. Getting rid of the jack also increased room for stereo speakers, and Apple sharpened the technology on most features, from the camera to a pressure-sensitive home button to a boost in memory. The new phone will start shipping in major markets, including the United States and China, on September 16. Bob O'Donnell of research firm TECHnalysis said Apple's new glossy black finish could be more popular than any tech feature, reflecting the slowdown in major tech innovations for smartphones. “While the camera improvements for the iPhone 7 Plus are nice, they are incremental for most and the lack of headphone jacks could offset that for others,” he said. Apple typically gives its main product, which accounts for more than half of its revenue, a big makeover every other year and the last major redesign was the iPhone 6 in 2014. Many are expecting a three-year cycle this time, culminating in a major redesign for 2017 to be called iPhone 8. Apple said its Apple Watch Series 2, with a swim-proof casing, will be available in more than 25 countries starting on September 16. “I predict Watch sales will improve dramatically,” said Tech analyst Patrick Moorhead. “Most of the current Watch owners are early adopters and the next wave could be 10 times the size of that market.” Apple also launched a new version of the device called the Apple Watch Nike+, in partnership with the athletic goods manufacturer Nike, featuring GPS so athletes can track their runs. Shares of Fitbit, which makes activity-tracking bands, closed down 2 percent on the emergence of such a high-profile competitor.

Speck is now announcing a new breed of Presidio-based transparent cases for the all-new 2016 MacBook Pro at CES 2017, which for the first time, brings as much as four feet of drop protection to Apple’s premium notebook computers thanks to the company’s patented Impactium material. Speck’s Presidio cases have been available for the iPhone for quite some time, and we went hands-on with the Grip series of the Presidio case lineup, but the transparent cases allow you to see through the case material to get a good view of the precision industrial engineering Apple is known for as it lurks inside the case. Like all Speck MacBook Pro cases in the past, they will be of a two-piece snap-on design. One half covers the keyboard side of the notebook, while the other half covers the display side of the notebook. When closed, the case provides 360º protection of the computer, which keeps it safe in your bag, or if it accidentally gets knocked off your desk somehow… (rowdy kids?) Presidio Clear for MacBook is made with Impactium Clear, a dynamic transparent material that absorbs and disperses shock upon impact and protects MacBooks from drops up to 4 feet. Impactium Clear is co-molded into a raised edge around the perimeter of the case that also provides a secure, no-slip grip, so you’re less likely to drop your device. The case’s dual-layer, two-piece design easily clips onto the MacBook. Speck’s Presidio case for the 2016 MacBook Pro will come in both clear and onyx color options, with the latter being a darker ‘smoked’ option for those who aren’t much for the clear alternative. It will be available for the 13-inch variant of the computer beginning in February of this year for $99, and options for all other models of MacBook will be released throughout the calendar year for approximately the same or similar price. Of course, it wouldn’t be a Speck case without the UV protection that it has built in, which resists the yellow colorization that can occur in similar cases due to aging and Sun exposure, so that’s a plus too. Speck brings new iPhone cases too In addition to the new cases for Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pro, Speck says updated Presidio Show cases are coming to the iPhone case lineup as well. The black version of the Presidio Show is already available on Speck’s website and looks great with the Jet Black iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus, but additional color options are coming in the future that compliment Apple’s other smartphone colors, including: Gold, Rose Gold, and Silver. Thanks to the Impactium material, these cases are good for drops of up to 10 feet, all while giving you a clear window into the precision device being cradled within. Their UV protection, which is built into the transparent material, also helps them to resist yellowing over time. Presidio Show was thoughtfully designed with the new iPhone 7 & 7 Plus in mind. The case features Speck’s Impactium Shock Barrier around the perimeter that provides 10-foot drop protection while the completely clear back shows off the phone’s design. Presidio Show comes in black, and will soon be available in gold, rose gold and silver, to perfectly match the different colors of the iPhone 7 & 7 Plus.  The iPhone 7 version of the case will set you back $40, but the bigger brother version for the iPhone 7 Plus will cost you $45.

The clips on their MacBook Pro case snapped off (a common design fault) and the case begun sliding. I removed the case to find very deep scratches on the base of my laptop.

 NOMURA: iPhone 8 is going to blow iPhone 6 out of the water Hannah Roberts Jan. 6, 2017, 8:00 AM 46,380 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook.REUTERS/Robert Galbraith Analysts at Nomura Instinet estimate that a "supercycle" will develop in the last three months of 2017 that will make iPhone 8 a much, much bigger product than iPhone 6. iPhone 6, launched in 2014, was an era-defining product for Apple that propelled the company to record sales. But Apple's iOS subscriber base — the number of people using an Apple product — is expected to be 45-50% larger than it was in 2014, according to Nomura Instinet. This next supercycle "seems well underappreciated," analysts Jeffrey Kvaal and Gregory McNiff wrote. Their forecast is higher than the consensus of their peers: "Consensus calls for 80 million iPhones in F1Q18 (Dec '17) ... only modestly above the iPhone 6 supercycle (75 million). However, we estimate the iPhone 8 will launch into an iOS subscriber base 45-50% larger than the iPhone 6 did and model 86 million iPhones in F1Q18 (from 83 million)." The increase in subscribers has been driven by sales of the iPhone 6, the analysts say. "We believe the iPhone 6 drove the iOS base up ~35%, followed by 5-10% increases from the subsequent devices," they wrote. Anyone who is still using an iPhone 6 is a prime candidate for buying a new iPhone in late 2017. The possibility that the upcoming iPhone could tap into a large base of people who are waiting to upgrade has been floated by several analysts before as a rationale for being bullish on Apple. The iPhone 8 — codenamed "Ferrari," according to leaked manufacturing documents — is expected to include a new kind of OLED screen already used by Samsung, which would allow the phone to have a borderless, all-display front surface. This OLED model may trigger replacement demand among high-end users, especially if it comes in an all-new design with notably superior specs, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Other rumoured features the document mentions include a glass-sandwich design — glass on the front and back of the phone — an invisible home button, and wireless charging.
