Related 'Google Pixel XL' review: A fresh take on Android 'OnePlus 3' review: Value-for-price flagship device with a fingerprint scanner This year, we’ve seen camera phones improve a great deal, thanks to larger sensors with larger pixels, wider apertures, dual lens systems, hybrid autofocus and even detachable camera mods. Karan Bajaj & Hitesh Raj Bhagat rank the top camera phones to help you choose the best one: Samsung Galaxy S7/S7 Edge While it’s hard to pick an absolute winner when you’re comparing these flagships, the Galaxy S7 has a lot going for it because of the reduced prices. You can snag a new S7 for about `43,000 at the time of writing which is great value for the kind of performance it delivers. The S7 camera is so good that the company left it as is, even in the ill-fated Note 7, which was supposed to be this year’s flagship. The f1.7 aperture combined with Samsung’s dual pixel autofocus delivers fantastic results irrespective of the scenario and lighting conditions. Moreover, the camera UI is loaded with tweaks and shooting modes. The f1.7 aperture combined with Samsung’s dual pixel autofocus in the Galaxy S7 delivers fantastic results. (Image: AFP) Apple iPhone 7 Plus/Google Pixel/Pixel XL We could not decide on a winner between these two phones for the second position. The iPhone 7 Plus is certainly one of the best in every aspect and has the best implementation of a dual lens system we have seen so far (that Portrait mode with super-shallow depth of field will blow you away every time). The issue is Apple still does not offer as much control over the camera as compared to Android. Google’s Pixel delivers fantastic details, the fastest autofocus around (beating even the mighty iPhone 7 Plus), super-stable 4K video and amazing low light capability thanks to some software magic. However, the pixel loses a point because it skips OIS — this is a vital spec in flagships now. The super-stable 4K video and amazing low light capability of the Google Pixel are a dream come true for any photographer. (Image: Reuters) LG G5/HTC 10/ Apple iPhone 7 The LG and HTC cameras deliver great results on their own, but in comparison to the phones on the top, they lose out. Both LG and HTC suffer from more visible noise when compared to our first and second position winners. Moreover, the dynamic range, colours and details in low light images are the common areas where both these phones loose out in comparison. The iPhone 7 has OIS compared to its predecessor and works as a great all-rounder phone like the LG and HTC. However, in a head-to-head comparison the Samsung, iPhone 7 Plus and Pixel, these phones feel lacking in results. OnePlus 3/Moto Z Both these phones tied for the fourth position for all-round performance. Both deliver fantastic images in day light but lost the top three ranks due to performance in low light. OnePlus 3 proved it mettle with great results in auto HDR mode and fantastic image stabilization (optical + electronic). Moto Z delivered better results with its f1.8 lens in low light compared to OnePlus but still was not up to the mark in comparison to the winners. What sets it apart is the option of the Hasselblad MotoMod. Using this snap on Moto Mod tuned by Hasselblad (a `20k option), you get a 10x optical zoom, support for RAW image capture and a xenon flash. Moto Z delivers great results with its f1.8 lens in low light. (Image: ​ www.motorola.in) Sony Xperia XZ/ Honor 8 The XZ has a 5-axis stabilization system for video recording and the phone manages to deliver top-notch stabilized 4k video. Its focusing system is fantastic with the combination of phase detection, contrast detection and laser autofocus. However, still photos are where it skips a beat — the lack of OIS leads to poor performance in low light images. The Honor 8 stands neck and neck with the Xperia XZ with its dual lens camera. While the shallow depth of field is not as good as the iPhone 7 plus, the Honor 8 captures good details. Low light images are great when viewed on the phone – look closely and you can see a lot of noise in darker areas. One letdown on Honor 8 is the lack of 4k video recording. Special Mentions Asus Zenfone 3 — Asus has focused a lot on camera quality with the Zenfone 3 range. It takes sharp images with minimal noise and has a great OIS system. The only reason it did not make it to the top 5 was that its performance indoors and in low light is lacking in comparison. Xiaomi Mi5 — Mi5 was amongst the best camera phones when it launched earlier this year. The 16MP camera combined with 4-axis OIS delivers good results in daylight but it’s not an all-rounder. In direct comparison, it fails to match up to the image quality delivered by our top 5 ranked phones. Nubia Z11 Mini — Nubia is still a less known brand when it comes to India (especially after separation from ZTE). However, the recently launched Z11 Mini’s camera shocked us with excellent dynamic range, natural colours and fast performance. If it included OIS and 4k video recording capability, it could have been in the top 5. Want stories like this in your inbox? Sign up for the weekly ET Panache newsletter.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending MacBook Pro Nintendo Switch Google Pixel iOS 10.1 PS4 Pro Early Black Friday Deals News Why we still need an SD card slot on the MacBook Pro Why we still need an SD card slot on the MacBook Pro By Kevin Lee Laptops   Opinion: Made for creatives – but not Shares Apple spent a great deal of time showing how the new MacBook Pro was specifically designed for creative professionals, from artists to photographers and videographers, during its launch event last week. However, one thing the tech giant glossed over was the laptop’s omission of the SD card slot.  Unlike the headphone jack funeral held during the iPhone 7 announcement, Apple didn’t spend any time mourning the removal of the SD card slot. This left many to speculate whether the omission of this crucial port was due to Apple’s vision of an all USB-C world. Or, perhaps the laptop was just too thin for it to be integrated. Compare this with Microsoft's Surface Studio efforts Well, today, Apple finally broke its silence on the matter. In an interview with The Independent, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller explained the company decided to remove the SD card reader because it’s a nuisance and wireless transfer is good enough. Here’s the full quote below: "Because of a couple of things. One, it’s a bit of a cumbersome slot. You've got this thing sticking halfway out. Then there are very fine and fast USB card readers, and then you can use CompactFlash as well as SD. So we could never really resolve this – we picked SD because more consumer cameras have SD but you can only pick one. So, that was a bit of a trade-off. And then more and more cameras are starting to build wireless transfer into the camera. That’s proving very useful. So we think there’s a path forward where you can use a physical adaptor if you want, or do wireless transfer." I’m sorry, Mr. Schiller, but you are completely wrong.  Because of a couple of reasons. First, Apple is in full control of designing a slot that can eat the entire card or have just a nub stick out on the back of the slot.  Second, CompactFlash was already on its way out and rapidly replaced by SD cards by the time the card reader was first introduced in 2009 with the first 13-inch MacBook Pro. Today, CF cards are rarely used and not found on most camera bodies, except the Canon 5D Mark IV and the Nikon D5. Finally, while wirelessly transferring photos from cameras has become increasingly easy, transporting images over the air to a computer is more complicated even if it's available on Sony and Canon cameras. Modern cameras are designed to create their own wireless network to connect to smartphones, but this functionality doesn't extend to computers. Instead, users need to connect both the camera and their laptop to an existing wireless network, a luxury that won't always be available in the field. What’s more, the images being transferred are often compressed JPEG when creative professionals need to transfer large RAW files. The 42.4MP Sony Alpha A7R Mark II, for example, produces files that are 63MB at a minimum, and the latest Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II produces RAW images averaging around 20MP. These files are only bound to get bigger as Medium Format Cameras begin to rise while the APS-C standard rises to 24MP and full-frame sensors regularly go above the 50MP limit.  And that’s just the still photography. The 4K footage and 1080p movies Apple hopes its users will edit with Final Cut Pro X on the Touch Bar can’t be wirelessly transferred to the new MacBook Pros, either. Some argue that it’s the camera manufacturers that need to adapt to the times and introduce faster data ports than a mini/micro USB 2.0 port. It’s a fair point. I just reviewed the first and only camera to feature USB-C, the OM-D E-M1 Mark II, and it’s baffling it’s taken this long for the new-fangled connector to appear on a camera when it seems like the perfect adopter.  However, one problem with transferring images and video over a wired connection is that it is very power consuming. If you ask any photographer or videographer to choose between burning through a battery to transfer files for 30 minutes or shoot all day, they would all almost pick the latter.  As a photographer and videographer myself, it’s hard to justify the cost of the new MacBook Pro even with its revolutionary Touch Bar. There’s a wide selection of Windows 10-powered machines to choose from that are just if not more powerful than Apple’s latest laptop and equipped with an SD card slot no less. So honestly, save yourself a lot of grief and get a Surface Book or another production machine today.

Apple Calls MacBook Pro SD Card Slot ‘Cumbersome’ Don Reisinger Laptop MagNovember 2, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Apple really doesn’t think including an SD card slot in your new MacBook Pro makes much sense. MacBook Pro Sans SD Card SlotMore Apple senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller told the UK’s The Independent in a recent interview that adding an SD card slot in the new MacBook Pro would have made it “cumbersome.” He added that MacBook Pro owners might get the most benefit from using adapters or trying out wireless transfer. MORE: Apple MacBook Pro 2016: Full Review “More and more cameras are starting to build wireless transfer into the camera. That’s proving very useful,” Schiller said. “So we think there’s a path forward where you can use a physical adaptor if you want, or do wireless transfer.” Apple touted its new MacBook Pro, which launches later this month, as its most powerful notebook to date. The computer comes in 13- and 15-inch variants and features a new Touch Bar above its keyboard to help users interact with both first- and third-party software. Apple’s new notebook is also its first to come with Touch ID, a fingerprint sensor found in the iPhone and iPad that will let users make secure payments and unlock their computer. Apple Touch BarMore After Apple announced the MacBook Pro at its event last month, some criticized the company for failing to include enough ports. The entry-level $1,499 MacBook Pro comes with just two Thunderbolt 3 ports; the $1,799 13-inch MacBook Pro comes with four Thunderbolt 3 ports, along with a headphone jack. Same thing for the $2,399 15-inch Pro. The SD Card slot is conspicuously missing, along with a full-size USB 3.0 port and HDMI out. For its part, Apple has argued that choosing a single card type is a mistake. The company notes that photographers, for instance, use all kinds of storage cards, like CompactFlash, to save their photos. The same is true for videographers. Choosing a single card to support in the MacBook Pro, then, would leave many others out. Still, Apple has supported SD Cards in the past by including readers with the iMac and even its MacBook Pro. Schiller says it was an attempt by Apple to pick the card most people used, but that simply doesn’t work any longer. MORE: MacBook Pro vs. Surface Book: How 2016's Models Compare However, eschewing the SD card reader might also be an attempt by Apple to save some money. Building an extra port into its svelte MacBook Pro, after all, increases costs and cuts into margins. And the profit-conscious Apple might have decided to eliminate the card reader instead of bundle one more component in what promises to be an expensive-to-manufacture computer. Many of Apple’s competitors have included a card slot in their machines, even if they’re slender. The Dell XPS 13, which is about the same size as Apple’s laptop, features both a full-size USB port and an SD card slot. So Apple's "cumbersome" explanation doesn't make a lot of sense. SD Card slot on Dell XPS 13More However, this is Apple – a company that removes components and features in its products on a regular basis. The idea that it’s doing so again with the SD card slot shouldn’t take anyone by surprise. Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next How Good Are the Walmart Black Friday TV Deals?

Seth McNew (TMFMcNew) Nov 2, 2016 at 6:24PM Fitbit's (NYSE:FIT) stock has been erratic in the past few years, with new lines of wearables often pushing share prices up, while renewed concerns over competition and pricing pressure push it back down. This is a trend that's been true throughout most of Fitbit's short stock history. Here's an analysis of Fitbit's stock performance, and some ideas about where it might go from here. Image source: Fitbit Inc. Fitbit's competition Fitbit has competition from some big-name players. These are not only similar wearables companies such as Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN), but also increasingly tech companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and fitness companies such as Under Armour (NYSE:UA)(NYSE:UA-C) -- each with much bigger pocketbooks to expand wearables. Then there are the lower-cost alternatives, such as China's Xiaomi, with its $15 trackers.  Company Market Cap IDC-Estimated Global Wearables Market Share (As of Q2 2016) Market Share Growth, Year Over Year P/E (TTM) Fitbit $3 billion 25% 28% 25 Garmin $9 billion 7% 106% 18 Apple $613 billion 7% (56%) 14 Xiaomi (Private) 14% 2.5% N/A Under Armour $12.5 billion Not (yet) in the top 5 globally that are recorded by the IDC N/A 69  Data sources: IDC, Yahoo! Finance. Fitbit is still the market share leader in wearables, and also one of the fastest growing in the segment in the past year. The most recent numbers from the IDC, the main resource for tracking wearable shipments, reported Fitbit at about 25% global market share as of Q2 2016. Its year-over-year growth was faster than Xiaomi's, and the Apple Watch shipments have fallen drastically -- though that was before the recent announcement of the Apple Watch 2 that became available in October. Fitbit's stock performance history Fitbit's stock has been volatile since going public in June 2015. After the stock's initial public offering of $20 a share, its price more than doubled to $50 in just two months. However, from there the stock has dropped (though with short stints going back up) to its current price around $13. FIT data by YCharts. By valuation, the stock has also been erratic. The company's price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple has been impacted by Fitbit's increasing outlay in sales, general and administrative, and research and development costs, which have risen 84% and 161% respectively year-over-year. This -- coupled with the fluctuating share price -- has resulted in the stock's P/E ratio swinging as much as 30% either way within just a few weeks throughout the past year.  FIT PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts. Where Fitbit could go from here Image source: Fitbit. Other than its growing competition, Fitbit has some serious hurdles to overcome. The accuracy of its monitors is one such recurring challenge. An October report by HealthDay showed that heart and vascular researchers at the Cleveland Clinic found the devices to be fairly inaccurate after conducting various tests. Fitbit denied the results, saying that its own results showed only a small margin of error, but the brand's reputation is still coming into question every time a report like this comes out.  In terms of new products, Fitbit has seen a strong sales surge from its newest products, including upgrades to its classic Charge tracker, as well as the newer smartwatch-like Blaze, which features a full touchscreen face. Fitbit is spending massively in R&D to try to continually put out upgraded devices, even if the brand isn't venturing far outside the wrist-based fitness tracker. And while Fitbit's market share has diminished -- it was an estimated 33% worldwide in 2014 Q3 -- this comes at a time when the market itself looks to be growing rapidly. Analysts at Scalar Market Research expect the market to grow 138% by 2021 $71 billion.   Finally, valuation: Fitbit's share price has dropped more than 50% in 2016, and though its P/E is not cheap at 25, its forward P/E of just 9.5 looks like value in this expensive market. Furthermore, analysts expect 2016 revenue to grow 39% over 2015. It's easy to point to Fitbit's risks and conclude that its stock will continue falling -- but this company has been doing something right recently with its growing sales and increasing market share in the face of intense competition. For that, and at this new low price, Fitbit stock could be a healthy choice.  Seth McNew owns shares of Apple, Under Armour (A Shares), and Under Armour (C Shares).

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube If there is one tech feature that is missing from the Apple Watch, it would a camera. Granted it’s not exactly a feature that high in demand, but we’re sure some users would not mind the feature anyway. That being said, the good news is that if you don’t mind third-party options, you’re in luck because Glide has recently announced the CMRA. As you can see in the video above, CMRA is basically a third-party strap for the Apple Watch that according to its creators, will give users two cameras: a 2MP camera and an 8MP camera. The 2MP front-facing camera will basically act as a FaceTime camera, so you can make video calls on your Apple Watch or snap selfies. The 8MP camera will be pointing outwards so you can snap photos without having to take out your phone. It also makes it more discreet if you’re into that sort of thing. According to Glide, the cameras on the band come with features like tilt-balancing, lens correction, noise reduction, and pixel optimization. The CMRA is definitely not the cheapest accessory we’ve seen and it is priced at $149 and can be pre-ordered via its website. However we should note that it will be priced at $249 once it is released, so if you want to save yourself $100 you should probably pre-order one now. Filed in Apple >Gadgets.

Sales of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus surged this festive season because of the Samsung Note 7 fiasco and attractive offers that the Apple laid out. Industry sources said all the iPhone 7 handsets shipped in had been sold out. Apple imported 235,000 iPhone 7 series of smartphones in the country following its October 7 launch. "Even though we are selling cash and carry, sales this year have doubled from the same time last year," an executive with one of Apple's distributors said. Apple had launched the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus in India in October 2015. Apple had last year imported 135,000 iPhone 6S series of handsets by mid-October, which climbed to over 300,000 by the end of the month. The big shipment during October led to fading sales by December 2015, when Apple shipped only 8,000 iPhone 6S series smartphones to India. Apple planned to keep the momentum going this year because the absence of rival Samsung's flagship Galaxy Note 7 from the market had provided the company an opportunity, an executive with another Apple distributor said. "Since the offtake at the distributor level has already surged more than 80 per cent, the company is coming up with more handsets," the second executive said. According to Tarun Pathak, senior analyst, Counterpoint Research, Apple is expected to post record sales in India during October-December. "The iPhone 7 has got off to a positive start in India. This will help Apple increase its average selling price in India, especially when almost half its sales in the previous four quarters were driven by iPhones 5s," he said. Apple has left no stone unturned this year to improve its performance in a market its chief executive Tim Cook considers crucial. Apart from tying up with Flipkart to improve online distribution, Apple has partnered Reliance for access to 120,000 smartphone sellers in the country. Flipkart is offering up to Rs 23,500 discount on exchange of used handsets, which brings the price of the iPhone 7 32GB variant down to Rs 36,500 from Rs 60,000. Cashback offers up to Rs 15,000 by Citibank in Reliance Digital stores are also driving iPhone 7 sales. 2SHARES Stay Updated with Us Top 10 Stories Last Week Last Month Last Year First casualty of Donald Trump's win? eBay sacks I...

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube This third-party Apple Watch strap can put two cameras on your wrist A messaging software startup company called Glide has introduced an Apple Watch strap with two built-in cameras. Glide’s Apple Watch strap has been named CMRA. It features a 2-megapixel front-facing camera for FaceTime video calling or selfies, as well as an 8-megapixel outward-facing camera for shooting subjects in front of you. There is a single button on the band that with a double-tap switches between the two cameras, an LED indicator and a microphone. “The camera is only valuable when it is out and ready to take a photo or video,” Glide CEO, Ari Roisman told Recode. “Our phones live in our pockets.” The CMRA smartwatch band can seamlessly connect and integrate with Apple Watch, and pictures or videos taken with the band get stored in stock Photos app. The CMRA essentially uses Apple Watch as a viewfinder, but the cameras also work without the watch or work even when the watch is off. The strap has 8GB of internal storage, which can store photos and videos when it’s working standalone. The CMRA is expected to ship in spring 2017. It will sell for $249, but pre-order price is $199 and the earliest orders will be getting it for $149. Consumers pre-ordering the device will also get a custom dual-charging dock that charges both the Apple Watch and CMRA together. The dock itself includes a battery pack, which can recharge the device twice. Source | Via "This third-party Apple Watch strap can put two cameras on your wrist", 4 out of 5 based on 18 ratings.

Like us on Facebook. Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now Apple is not interested in a counter-offer for Time Warner, according to a CNBC report. That means one less competitor for Dallas-based AT&T to worry about. The Cupertino-based tech giant appears to be passing on Time Warner and its valued TV content, which includes HBO, CNN and Warner Bros. and programs like "Game of Thrones." But Apple executives could change their mind during regulators' months-long review of the $108.7 deal that'd marry AT&T's distribution channels to Time Warner and its content. CNBC attributed the report about Apple to sources familiar with the company's thinking. The report said no other companies have made competing bids either. A few months ago, Apple executives approached Time Warner about a possible deal, but the preliminary discussions did not go further, according to a report by the The Wall Street Journal. Everything you need to know about the AT&T-Time Warner merger If Time Warner received and accepted another bid, it would have to pay a breakup fee of about $1.73 billion to AT&T, according to financial documents filed with the SEC. If the Dallas telecom company called it off, it'd pay far less -- $500 million to Time Warner. The difference in the breakup fees may indicate that AT&T executives were more concerned about being outbid than calling off the merger. As the world of TV gets more competitive, Apple has struggled to get a sizable piece of the pie. Its Apple TV streaming device debuted in 2007. When it was released, Steve Jobs described it as "a DVD player for the 21st century." Apple executives have also dubbed it the "future of TV." 100 channels, no dish: AT&T announces launch of DirecTV Now for $35 a month But Apple TV's growth has been sluggish compared to connected devices like Roku, Google Chromecast and Amazon Fire. It's also lagged behind streaming services like Amazon Prime and Netflix. Apple TV has about 20.5 million users in the U.S., compared to Netflix, which has more than 86 million subscribers. About 12 percent of total TV users with a connected device have Apple TV and that's expected to stay relatively flat over the next five years, according to a market research report by eMarketer. It attributed the slow growth to the device's high cost and its lack of original programming and quality content. How to talk about the AT&T, Time Warner deal like an insider "The promise of an Apple ecosystem of content and devices--something it mastered with the iTunes Store a decade ago--has yet to materialize in the fast-growing world of digital television," eMarketer senior analyst Paul Verna said in the report. Last week, Apple announced a new app called TV for the Apple TV device, iPhone and iPad, with the goal of making it easier for viewers to find TV shows and movies to stream. But the app won't include Amazon or Netflix and in some cases, will require a cable log-in, an obstacle for people who have cut the cord.  In this Collection...

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Xiaomi's New 'Mi Mix' Premium Smartphone is out to steal the Industrial Design Spotlight away from Apple | Main | Apple Alters an Invention for a Hollow Curved Glass iPhone Embodiment to that of a Transparent Glass Design » November 02, 2016 Apple Supplier Foxconn Introduced a new Augmented Reality Business today called 'LinkOOH'   The founder and chairman of Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn, is without a doubt, one of the most energetic entrepreneurs in China today. His company is the number one Apple supplier but is also the supplier to a host of technology companies such as HP, Dell, Xiaomi, Sony, Microsoft and others. They have a huge engineering division that files hundreds of patents under both Foxconn and Hon Hai every year. We've even covered a few for a game controller and a hybrid notebook. Hon Hai is one of the leaders in industrial robots. Earlier this year Foxconn acquired Japan's Sharp and is pushing them hard to enter Apple's Supply Chain for iPhone OLED displays in the future. More amazingly we recently learned that Foxconn and ARM will be creating a join chip design center in Shenzhen where Apple is building their new R&D Center. Then on Monday we learned that Apple gave Foxconn the green light to test wireless charging modules for future iPhones. We hardly digested that news and today we learn that Foxconn and Sharp are now diving into the Augmented Reality business.   According to a new report this afternoon we learn that earlier today the Foxconn Technology Group unveiled an augmented reality advertising project using high-resolution 4K TVs made by its Japanese subsidiary Sharp Corporation.   During a presentation at Taipei's main rail station, a major location for the new advertising project, Foxconn Executive Vice President Lu Fang-ming gave an augmented reality presentation in which his image was merged in real time with graphics.   "Foxconn has been trying to integrate software and hardware services over the past few years," Lu said. "Sharp is a leading industrial display provider in Japan...and we will use the best display technology available [for the AR advertising business]."   Lu did not say how much sales he expected the new augmented reality project would bring, but he said he hoped it could break even before the end of 2017.   Foxconn has invested another 50 million New Taiwan dollars (US$1.58 million) to set up a new company, LinkOOH, to develop the augmented reality advertising business in Taiwan. Lu said that LinkOOH now will use Sharp's high-resolution TVs for its various advertising deals.   In August Patently Apple posted a patent report demonstrating that Apple is continuing to work on a next generation of displays designed specifically to enhance Augmented Reality. Last month we posted another report titled "While Apple's CEO Talks Up Augmented Reality, TSMC Points to Specialty Chips for AR coming to Market in 2019."  So Apple and their suppliers are gearing up for the coming AR market in terms of displays and specialty chips that may come into play with Apple in the coming years. These are developments that we'll continue to track over time to help us all understand the bigger picture in AR that is beginning to take shape.   On a last note, it should be noted that Foxconn's Chairman Terry Gou is also a well-connected man in China. During Tim Cook's latest trip to China, Gou accompanied Cook when meeting Chairman Xu Shaoshi of China's National Development and Reform Commission and other senior Shenzhen officials to work out the details about their new R&D center.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

However, the firm today revealed that, despite users taking to social media to vent, they still appear to have pre-ordered the machine - in record numbers. Apple's Phil Schiller told The Independent's David Phelan even he has been shocked by the response. Scroll down for video  Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller has spoken out about the launch of Apple's MacBook Pro, which causes a huge furore online when it was revealed the firm had killed off a host of technologies - the traditional USB port, the SD Card slot and even the function keys. 'There has certainly been a lot of passionate dialogue and debate about the new MacBook Pro,' he said. 'So far our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before.  'So there certainly are a lot of people as excited as we are about it.' Users hit out at Apple's decision to dump traditional ports in favour of only having a headphone sockets at new 'Thunderbolt 3' sockets that mean users even need to buy a dongle to plug in an iPhone. It was Schiller who first confirmed it had killed off the function keys usually found on laptops, replacing it with a screen that changes depending on the app used.

'Now, we are replacing them with the touch bar'. The touch bar is a small touchscreen, which changes depending on the app being used.  It also has a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the power button. Apple's Phil Schiller unveiling the new MacBook Pro: Its keyboard gets rid of the traditional function keys, replacing them with a smart touchscreen that has a built in fingerprint sensor. The machine's new keyboard also gets rid of the traditional USB ports and the SD Card slot, replacing them with smaller USB-C - and comes just weeks after the firm killed off the headphone socket in the iPhone 7. 'Many things have impressed people about it, and some have caused some controversy,' Schiller admitted to the Independent.  'To be fair it has been a bit of a surprise to me.  'But then, it shouldn’t be. I have never seen a great new Apple product that didn’t have its share of early criticism and debate — and that’s cool.  'We took a bold risk, and of course with every step forward there is also some change to deal with. 'We know we made good decisions about what to build into the new MacBook Pro and that the result is the best notebook ever made, but it might not be right for everyone on day one.  FIRST IMPRESSIONS: THE FUTURE OF LAPTOPS  Even without the new touch bar, the new Apple MacBook is quite simply the best laptop on the market - but comes with a price. We were able to spend an evening with the lower end 13inch MacBook Pro, which is $1499 and comes with traditional function keys rather than the touch bar. It's a phenomenal piece of engineering, and incredibly light - indeed, as Apple's Phil Schiller said, its really a MacBook Pro that can replace the Air - and is the same weight, in fact.  The new $1499 MacBook Pro: While it may not have the glitz of the touch bar, this is a wonderfully engineered, powerful computer that is a worthy successor to the MacBook Air - and possibly the best looking machine out there (until its flashier big brother come out, anyway). The keyboard is really impressive, and keys have a 'feel' no other laptop, even those in Apple's own range, manage to have. It's screen is also really stunning, with bright colours and a real sense of images 'popping' that doesn't happen on other screens. The new machines also kill off the traditional USB port in favour of new, smaller USB-C ports  While its slick looks are simply stunning, and the space grey colour in particular is just beautiful, potential purchasers should be aware of its ports - or rather lack of. Instead of the traditional complement, there are just two Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone socket, with no traditional USB port in sight. This give an incredibly slick design, but does mean some short term pain - or at least money spent on dongles to get your current peripherals to plug in (including the iPhone and iPad).   But overall, while it may not have the glitz of the touch bar, this is a wonderfully engineered, powerful computer that is a worthy successor to the MacBook Air - and possibly the best looking machine out there. 'That’s okay, some people felt that way about the first iMac and that turned out pretty good. Schiller also defended the decision to kill off the SD Card slot. 'It’s a bit of a cumbersome slot. You've got this thing sticking halfway out. And then more and more cameras are starting to build wireless transfer into the camera.'  It also took aim at cable TV firms, unveiling a new TV app that will allow users to easily find and watch streamed and live TV in one place.  App makers including Microsoft have already begun including support for it into their software, Schiller said. The touch bar can display emotions in messaging apps, playback controls in music apps and other special functions. In Apple's iMessage, the bar displays suggested emoji, for instance. 'This is the gold standard in notebooks,' said Schiller.  The Macbooks will be available in 2-3 weeks, with the most expensive costing $2399, and the cheapest $1499,Apple said.  However, Apple somewhat spoiled the surprise by leaking a picture of the new MacBook in its own software. APPLE TAKES ON CABLE COMPANIES WITH NEW TV APP Tim Cook unveiled the firm's new TV app at a special event in Cupertino today, revealing it will be available on Apple TV, iPads and iPhones in December for US users.  Hundreds of providers have signed up to the service, including the BBC, Hulu and NBC - but Netflix will not be part of them, according to Variety.   Using the app, users can search for their desired content in the app, which then presents a lists of streaming platforms where it can be viewed – similar to a TV guide.   'We want Apple TV to be a unified TV experience,' Cook said. 'We are announcing a new app called TV.' The app brings together content from other video and TV apps, allowing them to be easily seen in one place. The app brings together content from other video and TV apps, allowing them to be easily seen in one place. The firm also unveiled a new search app for its Apple TV, and revealed Minecraft was coming to the platform. It can also show live TV, and users can ask for shows using Siri's voice recognition.  The app brings together content from other video and TV apps, allowing them to be easily seen in one place - but Netflix has not signed up. 'We said the future of TV was apps, said Cook. 'We now have 8,000 apps across every category, and over 1600 apps for video content.'  The new app will be available in December in the US, and will run on Apple TV, iPads and iPhones.  The app also tracks what content viewers watch and uses the data to formulate recommendations. Apple's new TV app brings together content from other video and TV apps, allowing them to be easily seen in one place. It shows the smart screen above the keyboard also doubles as a fingerprint sensor, allowing different users to easily log in. The firm also showed off a new high resolution cinema screen, and confirmed it was killing off its MacBook Air range in favour of the a lower cost version of the new MacBook with traditional function keys. The new display is sharp enough to show off pictures, allowing users to scroll through them easily. Tim Cook said the machine was crucial to Apple.  'The Mac is more than a product to us, its a testament to everything we do,' said Tim Cook. 'And this week happens to be a huge week in the history of apple and the Mac - the 25th anniversary of our first notebook, the Powerbook, which defined the modern notebook.  The new machine is 6.8 million times faster than the original, Schiller said.  When  using messages, the new bar can suggest the right emoji for users The MacBook Pro was revealed on the 25th anniversary of Apple's first notebook, the Powerbook, which defined the modern notebook, Tim Cook revealed (left). Phil Schiller revealed the new machine's smart screen (right). The aluminium design comes in 13 and 15inch models, in grey and silver, Apple's Phil Schiller said.  The 13inch version is 17% thinner than the previous MacBook, and weights 3lb - .5lb lighter than the previous version. The 15 inch version is also .5lb lighter.  It has a trackpad with force feedback.  APPLE'S NEW MACBOOK PRO SPECS  The new machine will also be available in a cheaper option with traditional function keys, Phil Schiller revealed. At just 14.9 mm thin, the 13-inch MacBook Pro is 17 per cent thinner and 23 per cent less volume than the previous generation, and nearly half a pound lighter at just three pounds.  The new 15-inch MacBook Pro, at just 15.5 mm thin, is 14 per cent thinner and 20 per cent less volume than before, and weighing just four pounds, is nearly half a pound lighter.  Retina display on the new MacBook Pro is an 67 per cent brighter than the previous generation, features 67 per cent more contrast and is the first Mac notebook display to support a wide colour gamut. Apple has also slimmed down the new MacBook - so much so it is killing off the MacBook Air. The also firm showed off a new app aimed at cord cutters. 'We want Apple TV to be a unified TV experience,' Cook said. 'We are announcing a new app called TV.' The app brings together content from other video and TV apps, allowing them to be easily seen in one place.  The firm also unveiled a new search app for its Apple TV, and revealed Minecraft was coming to the platform. Apple's first laptop, the Powerbook, left, was launched 25 years ago today. It's new MacBook Pro is shown right for comparison. It can also show live TV, and users can ask for shows using Siri's voice recognition.  'We said the future of TV was apps, said Cook. 'We now have 8,000 apps across every category, and over 1600 apps for video content.' The new app will be available in December in the US, and will run on Apple TV, iPads and iPhones.  Twitter also took to the stage to show off its Apple TV app, just hours after it was announced the firm was cutting 9% of its workforce and killing off the Vine app.       Read more: Apple may ditch traditional USB ports on the MacBook Pro 次期MacBook Pro、10月末に出荷開始？ | Rumor | Macお宝鑑定団 blog（羅針盤） Apple plans to launch new Macs at an October 27 event - Recode KGI: Apple to release new 13-inch MacBook plus two MacBook Pros at next week’s event, new iMac & 5K Display coming next year | 9to5Mac Images of New MacBook Pro With Magic Toolbar Leaked in macOS Sierra 10.12.1 - Mac Rumors Apple’s Philip Schiller talks computers, touchscreens and voice on the new MacBook Pro | The Independent Share or comment on this article e-mail 34 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Moment of impact as earthquake rattles home in Wellington Got any oink-tment?: Excited piglets take a warm bath SNL mocks government shutdown with Gravity skit Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Obama and Trump sit down to discuss the transfer of power James Corden sings for the 2016 Sainsbury's Christmas advert Is this the creepy moment the corpse of a girl OPENS her eyes?

Sure, Apple's new MacBook Pro isn't without its fair share of shortcomings, but the Touch Bar could very well prove to be a game-changing feature and many people are, in fact, excited about Apple's recent revamp to its notebook lineup. Earlier today, Apple executive Phil Schiller emphasized this point in an interview where he said that Apple's online store "has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before." So while there is clearly a vocal contingent of developers and creative professionals who are disappointed with the new MacBook Pro, their position is far from universal. DON'T MISS: Is this a reason to worry about the iPhone 8? Interestingly enough, a recent thread on Reddit, allegedly authored by someone working in Hollywood, relays that many folks within the industry are actually excited by Apple's new MacBook Pros. Asking around for opinions on a few production sets, our fearless Redditor found that the recently unveiled Touch Bar may prove to be a huge selling point. The thread reads in part: I figured I'd ask around the movie and TV sets I am on and see what people think. People are overwhelmingly excited for these computers from every department down. I'm telling you, from set design, to wardrobe, to script supervisors, to casting departments, props, actors, down to 2nd ADs, PAs and extras people are all generally excited to get these new computers. I've also talked with friends in the apparel industry, and marketing and everyone seems to at worst be happy for a spec bump, and at best super excited to see what the touch bar will do for them in their workflow so if you're wondering how at least entertainment industry professionals feel about them, they are all reacting pretty positively. Nobody at all is talking about the great Microsoft migration, nobody is gawking at the price, nobody wishes the laptops were touch screen. While far from a scientific survey, it's an interesting read given the avalanche of backlash that Apple's MacBook Pro has attracted over the last few days. What's more, given reports that Apple in 2017 will reduce the price and introduce a MacBook Pro model that can handle 32GB of RAM, the current MacBook Pro controversy, like most other Apple-oriented controversies, will likely come and go without so much as making the tiniest of dents on Apple's bottom line or reputation.

Judging from recent reports, the slump continues. Indeed, the boulder seems to be gaining momentum as it rolls down the hill. Last week, IDC said that 43 million units were shipped during the third quarter. That represents a year-over-year decline of 14.7 percent in tablet shipments. That is a big percentage, especially in a market that has been contracting for some time. Apple extended its lead somewhat over Samsung. The two remained the biggest players in the constricting market. Strategy Analytics also reported on the tablet sector last week. The report focuses on the progress that Apple is making. This is a sensitive time for Apple, considering its critically panned MacBook Pro. The company said Apple’s iPad Pro enjoyed a 6 percent increase in price and only endured a shipment loss of 6 percent during the quarter. That, on balance, beat the market’s 10 percent contraction and 7 percent average selling price. The bottom line is that the tablet market is moving from being broad-based and generic to being a bit more specialized. Part of that process, almost by definition, is that it will be smaller. The move to 2-in-1 devices is part of that. Talk Android reports that Barnes & Noble is reentering the tablet sector with a new version of the Nook. Not much is definitively known about the putative device, though the site takes some guesses. The important thing is that the idea of a purpose-built instead of a generic tablet is taking deep enough root to entice Barnes & Noble to release the new Nook. VDC Research also discusses a change in orientation for tablets. In this case, it is corporate devices: Over the next five years, VDC expects to see the consumer grade line of business (LoB) tablet market grow at a 3.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2020, while LoB rugged tablets will grow at a 1.4% CAGR through 2020. The total (rugged and consumer grade) LoB tablet CAGR though 2020 is 3.1%. Many of the industries with the highest potential for growth are those where the tablet form factor can be leveraged in customer-facing workflows to better allow employees to engage with consumers. The firm identified nine sectors. The top four, of roughly equal size, are retail shop floor and hospitality, field services, health care and manufacturing. Successful people and successful industry segments are resilient. At one time, tablets were king of the hill. Those times are gone forever. However, there is no reason that tablets can’t make the transition being moderately sized players. It is a change that the desktop PC market has undergone as well. The numbers may not be as gaudy, but they are still significant. Carl Weinschenk covers telecom for IT Business Edge.

November 2 AAPL: 111.59 0.10 Comment: People are complaining about the wrong things with the new MacBook Pro Zac Hall - 2 weeks ago @apollozac Feature MacBook Pro View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit I am really excited about the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. I placed my order for a 15-inch model with storage upgraded to 1TB SSD on day one which puts me in the initial 2-3 week shipping range between November 17 and November 25. I seriously cannot wait to unbox this Mac. The time between the unveiling and deliveries, however, has been filled with mass criticism targeted at nearly every change Apple has made between the last MacBook Pro design and the new one. This is a change MacBook Pro and we’ve been through these before. We’ll be fine. But in the meantime, I believe people are complaining about the wrong things. Remember the last change to the MacBook Pro? It dropped the SuperDrive, Ethernet port, Firewire port, dedicated audio line out jack, and Kensington lock slot, but not without a fair amount of criticism from Pro users. It’s that machine that a very vocal crowd is clinging to four years later. I’ve generally disagreed with much of the criticism flooding the new MacBook Pro so far. My colleague Ben Lovejoy has his own take on what’s been going on, and I think it varies for everyone, but I really like the direction of the new MacBook Pro and seriously question what some suggest Apple should have done. For example, MagSafe being replaced with USB-C. Sure, there are trade offs, but the charging situation on the new MacBook Pro is way better overall. MagSafe was a single port dedicated to nothing but charging. The MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has four USB-C ports, two on either side, all capable of being a charging port. Being able to choose between the right or left port may mean the difference in putting tension on the charging cable or not. You have up to four data ports at any given time which takes up the same amount of space as three data ports and one charging port when using MagSafe. The benefit of MagSafe is that it handles accidental tension more gracefully than traditional connectors. Steve Jobs pitched the magnetic connector that way in 2006 and I’m sure it’s saved a lot of MacBooks in the last 10 years, but (honestly!) I can’t recall my charger ever being tugged by mistake and MagSafe saving it. MagSafe was 10 years old and physically changed enough to require an adapter during its run. It was a novel connector before USB-C became the new default port, but it wasn’t perfect. Just imagine if Apple removed a data port that can also charge your MacBook for a charging port that happens to be magnetic… this is a step forward. The other benefit of having a connector like USB-C (which will be adopted by PC makers too) as the charging port is that one cable from an external display can provide power and data transfer to the MacBook. My colleague Jeff Benjamin has employed this single cable solution with his 12-inch MacBook and an external display. Compare this scenario to the now discontinued Thunderbolt Display. It connected over Thunderbolt for video and data transfer, and a MagSafe cable powered connected MacBooks. When Apple changed to MagSafe 2, Apple had to throw a MagSafe to MagSafe 2 adapter in the box. Connector aside, Apple has also moved to a brick style for MacBook Pros that we’ve seen for years with iPhones and iPads. You get a charging cable and a wall adapter that are two separate pieces. I’m not joking when I say this has real world benefits for me. I’ve replaced way too many MagSafe chargers because the wire went bad even though the brick was fine. You do miss out on the flip-out wings that MagSafe bricks had for cable management. It was a very Apple design. But my experience in college was seeing people either have no clue what the wings were for or wrap around them without giving it slack. I wouldn’t be surprised if this strain is the number one reason MagSafe adapters had to be replaced. The last MagSafe gripe I’ve seen is Apple not including the Power Adapter Extension Cable in the box. Without using the extension cable, you’ll see about eight inches more length from the 2m USB-C cable than what MagSafe offered (78-inches versus 70-inches). If you need the other 70-inches offered by the extension cable, you can buy it separately for $19 (or look in my closet because I’ve collected about a dozen of these over the years). Replacing USB-A (and all the other ports) with USB-C is also dramatic for people. But it’s clearly the future and so much better than what we’ve been used to before now. Embrace USB-C as fast as possible. Don’t bother with adapters except when you have to, replace your cables instead. It’s goofy that the iPhone currently ships with USB-A and new Macs ship with USB-C, but that’ll surely be sorted out next year. The idea of releasing a MacBook Pro with both USB-C and USB-A was never a possibility though. I’m buying my MacBook Pro to last the next four or five years at least. I don’t see USB-A lingering around that long so I’d end up with two dead ports or using USB-A to USB-C adapters. Take a moment to moan and sigh then embrace the future because we’re there now. USB-C has been ready but the superior connector won’t go mainstream until Apple’s mainstream laptop relies on it. Complaining about the price is fair. These new MacBooks created a higher tier in the lineup rather than replacing the MacBooks that came before them, but prices will normalize over time. This is what happens. I would also prefer the SD card slot to that headphone jack (especially if you’re a photographer who embraces wireless headphones), but Apple made a different decision there. When the Touch Bar versions of the new MacBooks start shipping, I think a lot of the criticism will die down really fast. People will love these new MacBook Pros, and they’re already being sold at a record rate. I do have my own complaints about the current lineup of MacBook Pros, but they’re not about the direction of the MacBook Pro really. I’m genuinely curious why the MacBook Pro label returned to the display bezel after moving to the bottom of the notebook on the previous model. Samsung puts their branding in your face, but iPhones keep their branding away from the display. The last MacBook Pro design was more tasteful here. I’m also disappointed that we didn’t see a matte black version that matches the matte black iPhone 7. I think it’s a much better color than space gray which seems like it’s on its way out, and you just know future MacBook Pros will be sold in black, right? There’s also no gold or rose gold which I’ve seen some people disappointed over; I’m sure this has more to do with what colors sell more but too bad. I was also hoping to see voice-activated ‘Hey Siri’ introduced on new MacBook Pros. I think this approach to Siri on the Mac could be very useful, but clearly Apple disagrees. My hope was we’d see a new chip in the MacBook Pro that powered Hey Siri, and we did see a new T1 chip for Touch ID and the new Touch Bar but no Hey Siri. Hopefully Apple reconsiders in the future as other devices that rely on battery for power handle it just fine. At any rate, I think a lot of this MacBook Pro criticism is severely shortsighted and will pass in a short amount of time — especially when these new models start shipping in a few weeks. I, for one, just can’t wait. Guides MacBook Pro View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Nov 2, 2016 at 4:33PM Despite Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) aggressive move to ditch a wide range of ports on its new MacBook Pro, including the older Thunderbolt port, HDMI, classic USB jacks, and the SD card slot, consumers appear perfectly willing to adapt. The new Touch-Bar equipped laptop is reportedly garnering more orders than any MacBook Pro in history. Apple's new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Image source: Apple. Phil Schiller talks Apple's new MacBook Pro "And we are proud to tell you that so far our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before," said Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller in an interview with The Independent this week. "So there certainly are a lot of people as excited as we are about it." Of course, it's not entirely surprising the new product is selling well. Sporting Apple's new Touch Bar, or a multi-touch enabled strip of glass built into the keyboard for accessing customized, app-specific tools on demand, Apple's new MacBook Pro represents a significant step in innovation for Apple's pro series of laptops. But in light of the product's criticism in the media, some may have questioned whether demand for the new product would be limited. Apple's new MacBook Pro is equipped with four USB-C ports and a headphone jack. Image source: Apple. The media has criticized Apple's decision to remove so many ports in favor of a sleeker design and USB-C. Apple's removal of the SD card slot, in particular, has been a subject of criticism. Often used for transferring large files of photos and videos from cameras to computers, the SD card is still commonly used by photographers. So far, however, record MacBook Pro sales suggest consumers seem to be overlooking any negative effects of Apple's port-killing spree. Maybe consumers can relate with Schiller, who told The Independent that Apple believed the slot was cumbersome. Here's exactly what Schiller said when The Independent asked Schiller why the company removed the important slot. Because of a couple of things. One, it's a bit of a cumbersome slot. You've got this thing sticking halfway out. Then there are very fine and fast USB card readers, and then you can use CompactFlash as well as SD. So we could never really resolve this -- we picked SD because more consumer cameras have SD but you can only pick one. So, that was a bit of a trade-off. And then more and more cameras are starting to build wireless transfer into the camera. That's proving very useful. So we think there's a path forward where you can use a physical adaptor if you want, or do wireless transfer. It shouldn't be a surprise However consumers feel about the SD card-less MacBook Pro, Apple will likely continue killing off ports for years to come. Ever since Apple controversially ditched the floppy drive in 1998, the company has continued to eliminate numerous ports swiftly and early. Other important ports to get the ax early on include the disc drive and the 30-pin connector. And the September launch of an iPhone 7 without a headphone jack confirmed the tech giant's ambition for moving toward a wireless future. Killing off ports has worked out handsomely for Apple in the past, and the SD card slot's eradication from MacBook Pro laptops will likely pan out similarly for the company -- even if it disappoints some customers in the near term.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     A fix for issues with 2nd and 3rd generation Apple TV is coming soon By Christian Zibreg, Nov 2, 2016 Tweet 3 Comments It seems that the most recent Apple TV software update has rendered a lot of second and third-generation Apple TVs virtually unusable, with the set-top box device’s Home screen displaying only the Computers, Music and Settings apps with no other channel options available. According to a thread on Reddit, an Apple representative has confirmed that a fix for the bug will be included in a future software update for the Apple TV. Users can manually check if any new firmware update is available at any time through the Settings app. Fourth-generation Apple TVs exhibit no issues. According to various reports, the second and third-generation Apple TVs would kick people out of Netflix, HBO and other video apps randomly, after which all apps go missing except for Music, Computers and Settings. People have tried restarting their boxes, unplugging and plugging them again and even resetting routers, to no avail. “I was watching my Apple TV just fine at around 10am yesterday,” one poster wrote. “When I came back later, the Apple TV displayed nothing but Settings and Computers”. The person says Apple’s support people are receiving “a ton of calls” about the issue. Another affected user wrote on MacRumors forums: All of a sudden last night the interface on my AppleTV blinked for a second and then all my menu options were gone except for Settings and Computers. I reset it, unplugged the cables, changed from wifi to ethernet and back, etc. The network test runs fine. The MacRumors poster added that doing a full restore only fixed the issue temporarily. As soon as the person turned on iTunes Match, everything disappeared again. Here’s one more account from another disgruntled user: All I see is a computer and settings option. In the settings option I have access to everything except the main menu setting. There’s absolutely nothing in there as an option. I’ve restarted my Apple TV as well as my AirPort Extreme. I’ve reset the Apple TV and I inserted all the info back in like my iCloud account etc. it obviously is logging onto the Internet since I was able to connect my iCloud account. One other strange thing is that my iTunes won’t recognize the Apple TV when I plug it in directly to my Mac mini via a USB cable. It just doesn’t show up. Other people claim that even though Netflix appears to crash the device, the Apple TV usually recovers on its own. The third-generation Apple TV and older normally displays Computers and Settings if there’s no Internet connection. Some folks have partially fixed the bug by changing DNS settings but this apparently doesn’t work for all users and the problem seems to be fairly widespread. As we told you recently, the third-generation Apple TV was removed from sale via Apple.com. The Cupertino company told its employees and education partners that it had phased out the device to double down on the fourth-generation Apple TV with Siri Remote, an App Store with downloadable apps and games, A8X chip and more.

Mobile 6 0 0 November 2, 2016 iPhone 8 Rumors: Apple’s 10th Anniversary Flagship To Feature Foldable Display? Simon Alvarez The iPhone 8’s release date is still almost a year away, but rumors about Apple’s highly-anticipated 10th-anniversary device are already abounding. With the Cupertino-based tech giant all but promising that the iPhone 8 would be its most revolutionary device yet, the hype surrounding the device is higher than ever. With Apple’s recent patent filing, however, the anticipation surrounding its next flagship device has broken through yet another ceiling. So what’s so unique about Apple’s recent patent? Simply put, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted Apple a patent for a foldable smartphone design. A Patently Apple report stated that the patent for a foldable smartphone was filed by the tech giant sometime in Q3 2014, under parent number 9,485,862. Considering that the patent was published on Tuesday, it appears that Apple has indeed been granted exclusive rights to the foldable smartphone design. Foldable smartphone concepts are nothing new. Samsung, Apple’s biggest rival in the smartphone market, has been exploring foldable smartphone designs for years. The South Korean tech giant has long teased the Galaxy X, which is widely speculated to be the world’s first consumer-ready foldable device. However, Samsung’s Galaxy X concept, which was unveiled practically three years ago, is yet to see an official release. [Image by Rob Stothard/Getty Images] A folding smartphone carries many advantages regarding design. For one, it would enable the device to have a much smaller footprint, especially when folded. It would also give users a bigger workspace since the device’s screen would essentially double once the display is unfolded. Considering that smartphones are essentially becoming all-in-one productivity devices for consumers, such advantages would certainly make the design very compelling. However, a foldable display presents numerous challenges, many of which Samsung is allegedly dealing with. With the delay of the Galaxy X’s release in mind, this does seem to be the case. Despite this, however, the recently-published patent appears to show that Apple already has a plan to make sure it would be able to make its foldable smartphone design feasible. These were described in the recently-published patent. “Conductive carbon nanotube paths can form signal paths that are flexible and resistant to cracking. The carbon nanotube structures may be incorporated into signal cables such as flexible printed circuit cables, rigid printed circuit boards, printed circuits that include rigid portions with flexible tails (sometimes referred to as ‘rigid-flex’), portions of display structures, portions of touch sensors such as capacitive touch sensor arrays for displays or trackpads, camera structures, antenna structures, housing structures, internal device structures, electrical components, substrates, brackets, housing walls, other structures, or combinations of these structures.” Thus, the magic of Apple’s foldable smartphone might very well lie in the use of carbon nanotubes. As for the device’s frame, the patent appears to show that the smartphone’s casing could either be glass, ceramic, metal or a special form of fiber. This, together with the nature of the innovation, has encouraged some Apple fans to believe that the iPhone 8’s killer feature might very well be a foldable display. [Image by Sean Gallup/Getty Images] While such a premise would indeed be interesting, it would be pretty difficult for Apple to incorporate a foldable screen in the upcoming iPhone 8. With the iPhone 7 being in the market for about two months now, there is a very good chance that Apple is already in the process of finalizing the design and feature set of the iPhone 8. Thus, while rumors might point to the iPhone 8 having a radical redesign, a foldable display might not be incorporated into the device just yet. One thing that Apple fans can look forward to, however, is a series of more pragmatic design changes to the iconic smartphone. Persistent rumors are abounding about Apple perfecting long-range wireless charging technology so that particular feature might very well make it to the iPhone 8. Apart from this, an edge-to-edge, bezel-less display is also widely speculated about the device. Apple’s iPhone 8 might not be as radical as a foldable flagship, but it would surely be one of the most notable smartphones that the Cupertino-based tech giant will ever release. Rumors about the device are very encouraging so far, as almost all alleged leaks and speculation point to a capable and groundbreaking new smartphone. For now, at least, the iPhone 8 would continue to exist in the realm of rumors and speculations, while the hype surrounding the device grows steadily. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QpWcuZ9UnDY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> [Image by Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Getty Images] Now Read This: Samsung Galaxy S8, S8 Plus, And Galaxy Note 8 Model Numbers Leak Share 6 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Simon Alvarez Tags: Apple, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Rumors Comments LATEST HEADLINES WWE News: Former Commentator Joey Styles Gets Fired From Multiple Promotions Over Offensive Comments At Evolve Event Lauren Jauregui ‘Lesbian’ Photo Leaks: Fans Blast Perez Hilton, Support Fifth Harmony Member Will One Direction’s Harry Styles Choose Kendall Jenner Or Suki Waterhouse: The Three Romances of A 1D Superstar Justin Ross Harris Found Guilty Of Murder In Son Cooper’s 2014 Hot Car Death [Video] ‘Public Health Crisis’ Following Trump Election: 250 Percent Spike In Calls To Suicide Hotlines, Students Crippled With Depression Bernie Voters Know Trump May Actually Do More To Put Progressives In Power Than Clinton Could ‘Pawn Stars’ Update: Chumlee As Kylo Ren And Donald Trump Jr. And Other Stars Visit Shop While Filming Season 13 Continues Wanda Sykes Booed Off The Stage For Trashing Trump [Video] Will Hot Car Death Dad Justin Ross Harris Get Life In Prison?

Apple, the company that now sells how many dongles? 0 Share: Tech Culture by Chris Matyszczyk November 2, 2016 12:22 PM PDT @ChrisMatyszczyk Up Next Fantastic Beasts' Dan Fogler sees magic in tech Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives. Oh, look. The dongle that smiles at you.Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET Not so long ago, I sat in a meeting with executives from a very famous company. They all came in with their bright, new, shiny MacBooks, ready to connect their machines to a projector. Their dongles dangled from their hands, as they tried to connect one thing with another. The struggle was quite laughable. Wait, was it this dongle? Or maybe this one? The boss, a man of advanced years, turned to me and said, "Technology." What was odd about it was that this was Apple technology. Last week's revelation that you needed a special dongle to hook up your new iPhone 7 with your new MacBook Pro made me a little sad. It made me think about Apple once being the simple brand and now bathing in complications. Profit-making complications. Just how far would this dongle fetish stretch? I was moved by Twitterer Drew Breunig, who helpfully tabulated that Apple now offers 17 different dongles. I confess that when I went to Apple's accessory store, I got wrapped up in what appear to be 19. Some of these, of course, connect items that are tending toward obsolescence. Still, regardless of whatever the exact number may be, the mere thought that you now have to have several little cords in your computer bag at all times doesn't seem to jibe with the Apple many people know. Breunig even mused, "Laptop bag manufacturers will be creating the 'dongle wallet' category shortly." And would you believe that one already has? Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Somewhere in my head I remembered that Apple used to mock Microsoft for its extreme user-unfriendliness. This was even before the "Get a Mac" campaign came along to make Microsoft seem like a sad anachronism. In 1992, The Seattle Times wrote about then-new Apple ads that mocked Microsoft by bemoaning, "All I wanted to do is simplify my job." Another celebrated Apple's portables by declaring, "Sitting in coach between two sumo wrestlers, (I pull out my laptop)." Yes, Apple's computers were really making things easier, even for those who flew in coach (and coach was a lot more comfortable then that it is now). Yet another Apple ad read, "I feel like I'm being pecked to death by ducks." This one talked about all the little bits and extras you had to buy to make a PC work well. More Technically Incorrect Razer mocks Apple MacBook Pro with crude 'humor' Trump claims Google, Facebook, Twitter hid Clinton email news Microsoft vs. Apple: The two videos that show the difference At the time, not everyone was impressed. I found this critic, who offered, "Apple no longer has a monopoly on easy to use." He wasn't quite right. For many, many years it did. The phrase "It just works" was an unofficial mantra for those real humans who looked at an Apple product, turned it on and intuitively worked their way around it. There's nothing intuitive about dongles. There's everything annoying about them. Of course, this strategy might be an interim measure in preparation for a completely wireless world. But can anyone living in Dongle Purgatory truly say this feels like Apple?

A reader explains. New Google Pixel XL phone. (Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images) Letter to the editor: Competition gives us more choices, lower costs, better quality and more freedom. Imagine if there were no Samsung Galaxy. Would the iPhone be what it is today? Would it cost the same? The answer is no. Without Samsung, Apple would not have made the advances they have because there wouldn’t have been a need. Samsung forces Apple, and Apple forces Samsung, to make a better quality product. Their constant battle for market share gives us a better product at a lower price. Google’s release of the Pixel is only going to benefit us, the consumer. Not only does this provide us another choice, it also creates a three-way battle in which the ultimate prize is our hard-earned money. In their attempt to win that prize, these companies are going to up their research and development to produce a better product at a lower price. USA TODAY Policing the USA If you view our political system through the same lens as cellphones, you won’t find the same type of competition. While we can say Samsung and Apple represent Democrats and Republicans, we can’t say they compete in the same way. The debates, commercials and mailings appear like competition, but what these two parties are truly competing against is competition from another party, be it the Libertarian, Green, Socialist, or any other party out there. There is very little that exists anymore that distinguishes these two parties from each other. Because they are nearly one and the same, the last thing they want is for there to be another choice with better quality. Until these two parties start losing market share, they do not have to offer a better quality product. If these two parties don’t lose market share in this election, rest assured they will continue churning out the same product election after election.

In the video, a man sets his iPhone to play dramatic music (La Virgen de la Macarena by Arturo Sandoval) while at the pool. He then proceeds to climb up to the high dive, jumping off as the music climaxes. The iPhone is splashed with water during the process, highlighting its water resistance. The iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus are Apple's first iOS devices with superior waterproofing, offering IP67 water and dust resistance. The two iPhones can withstand being submerged in up to a meter of water for 30 minutes, and are resistant to splashes and accidental spills. Intentional water exposure is still not recommended, however, as Apple's warranty does not cover water damage. As for the speakers, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus include one speaker at the bottom of the phone and one speaker at the top of the phone, introducing stereo sound in the iPhone for the first time. The speakers put out twice the volume of the single speaker in the iPhone 6s and have been designed to offer superior sound in both landscape and portrait mode. Apple has thus far produced several ads showing off the iPhone 7, highlighting features like waterproofing, the camera and its ability to capture low-light images, and its longer battery life. The iPhone 7 has also been featured in an ad focusing on the Messages Screen Effects available in iOS 10.

Rating: 23 Votes macTW 2 weeks ago I am a little worried if the best innovation of the iPhone 7 that is worth promoting is... water resistance - something the $20 Casio watch I had back in the 1990's delivered flawlessly.

In the letter, the noted analyst says that we likely won’t see these efforts for 1-2 years, but when we do they will redefine Apple’s current products and open up new categories. All of Apple’s past successes were related to human-machine interfaces, such as mouse for Mac, click wheel for iPod, and multi-touch for iPhone and iPad.  Assuming Apple successfully develops AR, we predict the firm will enjoy the following competitive advantages: (1) redefining existing key products and leading competitors by three to five years. For instance, this could happen for iPhone, iPad and Mac; (2) eliminating obstacles of Apple Watch and Apple TV by offering an innovative user experience; and (3) entering new business fields, such as autonomous driving system.  We expect Apple to generate preliminary results for AR in the next 1-2 years at the earliest and working with iPhone may be the first step. Apple has plenty of augmented reality-related patents and experts in its war chest, and CEO Tim Cook can’t seem to stop raving about the tech. Combine that with all of the rumors we’ve heard regarding Project Titan and Apple’s interest in developing an autonomous driving system, and it’s possible that Kuo is onto something.

A patent for a foldable smartphone has this week been awarded to Apple. By Anthony Cuthbertson On 11/2/16 at 11:28 AM Close Apple Unveils The New iPhone 7 Next year marks the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, and Apple is widely thought to be planning something major for the double-digit birthday of its flagship product. And judging by a new patent awarded to Apple, the iPhone 8 may well confound even the most speculative of analysts. Published by the United States Patent and Trademark Office on Monday, Apple’s latest patent describes a foldable iPhone concept that uses carbon nanotubes to allow the smartphone to fold completely in half. Sign up Sign up to our daily newsletter for up to date global news and features. <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p> Apple has been exploring the concept of foldable and bendable smartphones since 2013, with patents including a Flexible Electronic Device from 2015 that made use of flexible printed circuits, flexible batteries and flexible displays. A patent for a foldable smartphone was awarded to Apple Tuesday by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. USPTO It is not the only smartphone manufacturer to be looking into such concepts, with chief rival Samsung filing dozens of patents relating to such technology. Whether or not any of them find their way into actual products remains to be seen, but the continued interest suggests the companies are serious about at least attempting to make the concept a reality. The relatively anti-climactic launch of the iPhone 7 appears to be proof that Apple is switching to a three-year iPhone cycle. The Cupertino company previously took two years between full-model changes, however the device unveiled in September was more of an incremental upgrade of its predecessor, the iPhone 6s. Industry analysts have pointed to a slowing market and limited advancements in smartphone functions as reasons for Apple’s switch. Apple reported its first decline in iPhone sales earlier this year, with a 16 percent drop in it Q2 2016 results. CEO Tim Cook cited the pace of smartphone upgrades as a reason for the slump, saying the iPhone 6s was unable to match the “accelerated” upgrade cycle the company achieved when it launched the iPhone 6 in 2014.

The good news is that Twitter user @heyeased back with a fresh new batch of awesomely glitchy wallpapers, and they’re some of his best ones so far. The bad news is that Apple has finally decided to put an end to all the fun in iOS 10.2, so this is probably the last batch of glitch wallpapers that iPhone users will ever be able to enjoy. Not sure what we’re talking about? Let’s backtrack a bit. MUST SEE: Amazon’s huge Black Friday 2016 sales event is has officially begun As a result of a mysterious bug in iOS, certain wallpapers cause fun side effects on the iPhone and allow users to customize their iPhone interfaces in fun and unique ways. The wallpapers were created by Twitter user @heyeased, and each one is actually only one pixel square. For whatever reason, when one-pixel images are set as the wallpaper on the iPhone, it causes the dock and folder background to glitch or even disappear. The black version of the wallpaper is a fan favorite among black and jet black iPhone owners, but there are many more available in a wide range of colors. Now, back to the good news and the bad news we mentioned earlier. @heyeased has posted two new batches of glitch wallpapers and they’re some of his most creative ones yet. The first batch consists of a wide range of solid colors that all have the same effect as the original black wallpaper — they make the dock and the folder background the same color as the wallpaper, effectively making them invisible. You can check them all out and download them for free in this post on his site. The second batch is our personal favorite. These wallpapers have one background color and a second contrasting color for the dock and folders, resulting in a look as seen in the image above. There are two full pages of different color combinations, and you can find them all in this post. As a reminder, all you need to do is tap and hold on any wallpaper in Safari to save it to your Photos app, then open it in photos and apply it as your wallpaper. Just make sure that “Reduce Transparency” is not enabled (open Settings > General > Accessibility > Increase Contrast and toggle “Reduce Transparency” to off). These wallpapers will work on any recent version of iOS 9, iOS 10 or iOS 10.1, but don’t update to the newly released iOS 10.2 beta if you want to use any of them. That’s right, Apple finally decided to fix the bug that caused these fun, harmless glitches. Oh well, it was fun while it lasted. And of note, the nifty optical illusion wallpapers we told you about all still work.

Here’s Apple’s new iPhone ad for Game 7 of the World Series Posted Nov 2, 2016 by Romain Dillet (@romaindillet) 0 SHARES Next Story Kenyan startup Ushahidi launches a crowdsourced campaign to monitor the U.S. election Apple released a new video ad just in time for Game 7 of the World Series (that’s baseball, and it’s not really a “world” cup). And this is a good one. Like previous ads, Apple is focusing on just one new feature in the iPhone 7. All of my friends have been asking me what’s new in the iPhone 7. After so many iterations, it’s hard to keep up with new features. That’s why Apple needs to educate potential customers about what’s new. In this specific ad called “Dive,” you can see a very athletic man who is in his golden years. He challenges himself by diving from a high platform. But first, he needs the right music to do it (“La Virgin de la Macarena” by Arturo Sandoval). The iPhone 7 stereo speakers are much louder compared to the one in the iPhone 6s. Sure, they don’t sound as good as your home speaker, but if you’re listening to a podcast while doing the dishes or are in a hotel room, they could still come in handy. There are many visual and audio cues that make you understand that the speakers are louder. First, the trumpet is powerful and quite effective. Second, the water ripples around the phone and the fact that he still seems to be able to hear the music from the top of the diving platform show that it’s loud. But the best part of the ad is probably the anxious anticipation of the dive. Until the very last second, you think it could end up being a marvelous belly flop. But our diving champion saves the day. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Founded 1976 Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.

The ad shows off the improved water-resistance features of the iPhone 7 with a scene in which an iPhone is left to get splashed with water poolside. The new iPhone 7 is IP67 rated making it splash-, water- and dust-resistant. Apple uses the opportunity to also highlight the much improved stereo speakers on the new iPhones. Eagle-eyed readers might spot a shoutout for Apple’s new wireless AirPod headphones when a screenshot of Control Center is shown, but so far Apple has yet to offer a solid release date for those after announcing a delay for the original late October release date. The new “Dive” iPhone 7 ad features the song La Virgen de la Macarena by artist Arturo Sandoval. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 2, 2016 at 3:06PM My fellow Foolish colleague Evan Niu recently penned an excellent column discussing Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) skyrocketing investments in research and development. In a nutshell, even as Apple's revenue growth has slowed (and, in the case of fiscal year 2016, turned negative), the company has continued to ratchet up its spending on research and development. Image source: Getty. The slowing revenue picture, coupled with continued growth in research-and-development spending, has eaten into Apple's overall profitability, which may draw concern from some investors. AAPL Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts Now, even though a good chunk of that now quite large research-and-development budget is probably being spent in service of all new product categories that haven't yet begun to generate revenue (Evan mentions augmented and virtual reality, and self-driving cars as two examples), I believe that a large part of the growth is also spent servicing of the company's existing product lines. The natural R&D inflation Investors should always expect the costs to develop future versions of existing product lines (e.g., the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Watch) to gradually rise. That natural inflation in research-and-development spending is driven by several factors. One obvious one is the fact that many companies, especially healthy ones, tend to give their employees raises. Even if one figures that these raises are on the order of 2% to 3% per year, that's still going to have a real impact on a company's operating expenses. Beyond that, there's the simple fact that these devices become much more complex in terms of both hardware and software each and every year. The sheer amount of engineering effort that goes into building something like the iPhone 8 is going to be way more than what it took to build the much less sophisticated iPhone 5. Advancing the state of the art doesn't come cheap. Apple is bringing more technology development in-house Back in April 2015, in response to a question from an analyst about Apple's increasing research-and-development spending, Apple CFO Luca Maestri said the company is "developing some core foundational technologies more in-house now than we have in the past." By bringing key technologies in-house, the company can tailor technologies to better suit its product needs. This, ideally, should allow Apple to deliver superior user experiences. More importantly, though, by bringing more technology development capabilities in-house, it can work on proprietary features and innovations that it can keep exclusive to its own products for longer -- potentially opening competitive advantages for Apple's products in the marketplace. Don't worry about Apple's R&D spending if it produces results In an ideal world, Apple (or any company, really) would be able to spend an anemic amount of money on research and development while bringing in large amounts of revenue at high gross profit margins. Unfortunately, that's just not how it works. The key is for Apple to spend what it must to make sure its products in its core markets are best-in-class while making smart bets on new technologies, products, and services that could potentially open large revenue streams in the future. So far, I'd say Apple has done a good job of managing that, so investors should have a little faith that if Apple is boosting its spending that it's doing so to maximize long-term shareholder value.

Larry Crozier felling tree while standing on ladder held up by the tree – this makes sense? L/R Ellen Collins and Lorie Fawbush at Disney World – this torture makes sense? By Bill Frazer Since my brain cavity has shrunk, I have to contend with the limited functions that I have remaining. I see a lot going on that doesn’t make sense. I admit that in old age my demeanor is more like Crabby Apple (whoever he was – I seem to remember that he was a grumpy character in early cartoons). I drove the wife to the Doctor in Opelika the other day when a pickup followed me onto the Interstate heading toward Opelika. Well I thought the guy must have been in a hurry as I was on cruise control at 70 mph and he went by me like I was standing still. Crabby thought that he must have been going 80+ mph and risking a ticket to travel the 21 miles and get there 3 minutes before I did. The pickup with the Bear Bryant sticker was in a hurry to show everyone how fast his fancy pickup equipped with everything except a kitchen sink would run. The good part about it is that he can probably afford the $250 speeding ticket. One thing for sure, the State Of Alabama needs the money. It doesn’t make sense to me to risk a ticket to save 3 minutes of travel time. When calculating the time in round figures, Crabby says that it does not make sense. My daughter, who visits us in West Point, gets on the plane in Nashville and flies to Atlanta a 1 hour trip costing $200. That is wonderful traveling to GA in an hour. However, look at the facts: she spends 30 minutes to get to the airport and 1 hour before departure for screening. She is in flight 1 hour and it takes .5 hours picking up her luggage and getting out of the airport to her ground transportation which is Crabby Apple. Then another 1.5 hours is spent getting out of the airport and traveling to West Point. Note that Crabby Apple had to spend 3.0 hours traveling to Atlanta and return and pay a parking fee in the Atlanta Airport. Unless she had someone to take her to the Airport, my daughter has to pay a parking fee in Nashville. My daughter has spent 4.5 hours making the trip that she could make in the car in 5 hours and carried the whole family with her if she wished to do so. However if Crabby had to drive to California to pick up my off spring and her younguns, I am ready to leave. This expenditure does not make sense to Crabby Apple either. My nephew has a new truck (at least it looks like new) and he spends $600 to install a heavy guard rail on the front bumper of his new truck. I have to admit it looks cool and it fits in with the image of a Southern buck hunter or one of Johnny Cleveland’s fox hunting crowd. Now, what do you think is the possibility of a local vehicle running into a deer in our locale? I have been driving on the highways for the past 70 years and have never even been close to hitting a deer. Admittedly, I have known a few people who have hit a deer and damaged the front end of their vehicle. However, that is what insurance is all about and you are required to have it if you are a licensed driver. The odds of a motorist hitting a deer in our locale is similar to the chances of Donald Trump making a pass at Hillary. Allegedly he has hit on all of his female acquaintances, so maybe I shouldn’t assume. Yeah I know, Crabby Apple is just an old goat who does not fit the concept of the new generation. But every day I go past the intersection of US 29 and South 10th Streeet in Lanett. That intersection is the southern end of the old Lanett mill site where one turns to go into the water treatment plant. Up until recently, the light at that intersection only changed when traffic on 10th street approached and triggered the change. But now the light changes even there is nobody even near the intersection coming in from 10th street. This only impedes the heavy flow of traffic on US 29 for no good reason. At least it seems that way to Crabby and everybody else that I mentioned it to. This past week Barbara Ruddick posted a warning on the West Point Neighborhood Watch web site about coyotes in local residents yards. According to city ordinances, the residents cannot kill the coyotes even though they will eat your pet if he is in your yard when the coyote is looking for a meal. You are only allowed to run him off. Well let me tell you what old Crabby would do to solve the problem. If my pet lived in my back yard and Wily coyote trespassed, just as Ken the lawyer says, one ball and that’s all. A 22 rifle bullet would solve the problem and I would haul him off to let the buzzards have a meal. And if the Chief next door asks me about the noise, it was my Halloween balloon that burst. Crabby readily admits, everybody is entitled to their own opinion and it probably is more sensible than the rants on this page. Well Donald doesn’t mind expressing his opinion, so why shouldn’t I? However, as Donald found out it can get you into a lot of trouble when the best thing to do is to keep your mouth shut. I am sure that James Walter Allen would agree.

Rather than feature the plethora of ports found in the 2012 MacBook Pro, Apple has nixed USB 3.0, MagSafe and the SD card slot in favour of USB-C, with its new devices. While USB-C is the future of connectivity, that future isn’t quite here yet, forcing those opting to purchase Apple’s new MacBook to adopt the #donglelife. While the switch to USB-C makes sense and can be defended to some extent, dropping the standard SD card slow is nearly impossible to justify. In an interview with The Independent, Apple executive Phil Schiller said that Apple removed the SD card slot because it felt the port was “cumbersome” and that wireless transfer technology for DSLRs and other cameras is “proving very useful” as an alternative. Anyone who has attempted to transfer photos to their laptop, whether your camera of choice is a Nikon, Canon, or a mirrorless shooter from Panasonic or Sony, know that this is not true. In order to send photos to your laptop, you first need to navigate to a specific menu in the camera and in most cases, connect to a Wi-Fi signal emitted from the camera, and, in some cases, even install software on your laptop to complete the transfer. This is far more difficult than simply popping a card out of the DSLR and sliding it into your computer, especially for someone like myself who often covers live events in a fast-paced environment. Find the full statement from Schiller’s interview with The Independent below: “Because of a couple of things. One, it’s a bit of a cumbersome slot. You’ve got this thing sticking halfway out. Then there are very fine and fast USB card readers, and then you can use CompactFlash as well as SD. So we could never really resolve this — we picked SD because more consumer cameras have SD but you can only pick one. So, that was a bit of a trade-off. And then more and more cameras are starting to build wireless transfer into the camera. That’s proving very useful. So we think there’s a path forward where you can use a physical adapter if you want, or do wireless transfer.” Schiller also claims that Apple plans to “help people through these changes,” though doesn’t specify if the company has any specific plans to help users deal with the growing pains of adopting USB type-C. Schiller also recently stated in an interview that the new MacBook Pro only features 16GB of RAM in order to save battery life.

Raj Singh His comments on wireless: “Having to create another device you have to plug into the wall is actually, for most situations, more complicated.” Captain Henry Morgan cause Apple cares about the environment!

Andrew English Sure Apple will sell some of their MacBook Pro’s but not as many as they could if they didn’t remove all those ports. 🙂 LeTricolore If someone wants to spend the $2000 on a Macbook Pro, I’m sure they wouldn’t mind spending the extra amount on an adapter.

Maybe next year they will also release the iBag for $69.99 to carry all those adapters! Homer J. Simpson As much as I like to think Apple removes useful things and dislike most of Apples products, I do agree that sd card reader isn’t all that necessary when usb micro/sd readers are dirt cheap. Unless you’re a serious photographer or action cam fanatic, you likely won’t need the sd card port. Most people take photos with their phone and transfer files through cloud anyway. Edit: well type-C microsd card readers may not be that dirt cheap I guess. The Iceman Cometh Serious, professional photographers do not use their phones or cloud services to transfer pictures. What’s the point of calling this a Pro device when it’s obvious it just isn’t? Homer J. Simpson Honestly I think you’re reading too much into the names. Most people do not buy electronics because of the name. I’ve been shooting with my DSLR for the past 6 years and I often transfer photo from the SD card to my laptop. When I buy a laptop, I don’t look at a higher price tag or a “pro” name and assume it will work for me as a photographer. Also, I don’t think I’ve ever bothered to look at SD card availability when I buy laptops. Jin Woo Shin transferring several GB files using wireless or cloud is too slow, takes long, consume more power which is critical for the laptop. So,, Apple simply says that “if you need more than we support, spend more money and buy our accessaries.” Homer J. Simpson Right, but what I’m saying is, how many people actually use the SD card port to transfer photos when the majority of people have stopped using digital cameras aside from the serious photographers. FlamesFan89 I think you missed the part where this is their “Pro” lineup, supposedly targeted at… Professionals, like, say, a professional photographer. Homer J. Simpson Well, the word Pro is really up to interpretation. Not to mention, there are hundreds of professions out there, there’s no saying which profession it is meant for. Professional musicians can’t plug in MIDI comm to this laptop, shouldn’t Apple build that port natively too then? FlamesFan89 The word Pro isn’t really up to interpretation. It has a defined meaning. That said, you make a somewhat valid point that there are many professions, and they can’t tailor to all of them. However, when was the last time a laptop contained a MIDI port? The mid 90’s? Any professional musician likely already owns a MIDI to USB passthrough if they use a keyboard, because, well, like I said, laptops haven’t had a MIDI port in a very long time. The point is not that Apple should tailor to everyone, it is that they have taken away a feature, without there being a decent replacement option, and have tried to spin it as though it is a good thing. Jin Woo Shin Yes. Don’t forget it there are lots of serious pro and amateur photographers who uses MacBook pro. fred Apple “Pro” devices (Mac Pro, Macbook Pro) are clearly not meant for professionals anymore. Real pros need ports and expandability. Two characteristics Apple devices lack. Pros don’t need the device to be as thin as possible. cappein Apple’s definition of “Pro”: more profit margin for them! Jo Let’s see how many people “need” this device then! cappein “the MacBook Pro doesn’t need an SD card port” and I no longer need a macbook pro Jin Woo Shin Apparently Apple hate wire but they love dongles. TrickyDickie “There’s a dongle for that.” Lol Omis Yeah that was a BS move Apple. cappein Come on, we all know that we have been using the computer “wrong”, with a “cumbersome”, “unnecessary” “old tech” yet we did not have “courage” to go through “these changes”. So we need to buy additional $500 worth of dongles. And of course, we “don’t need more than 16GB of RAM” because it’s not “efficient enough for a notebook”. Sergei Mutovkin Wireless transfer would be great tech if at least one camera maker did a half decent job of creating solid Wifi-Direct stack with Bluetooth LE assist for the setup. I know no camera that does this. The only company that could have done this is Samsung but they are now out of camera business and Japanese camera makers don’t know how to write software/firmware. There is one more problem however, battery life, in my experience with TS5 or RX100 you need to have a spare battery just to transfer files. Cameras are very efficient at taking pictures as soon as they have WiFi on you can see battery bar drop every few seconds. jay On one side saying is sticking out and looks big but carry around dongles and card readers is better ? Than I prefer a SD card reader and no dongles moviegab you guys like to crap on apple but its the only way to push tech companies to use the new technology out there. Everyone laughed at apple when they removed dvd drives….. The Iceman Cometh Yes and that was a mistake too. It’s not up to Apple to tell people what they should and should not use. Incorporate new tech for sure but don’t standardize it when the market has yet to catch up moviegab theres not much to catch up, I havent used a CD in over 10 years! lol Also, everyone else followed apple a year or two later. My last 2 dell laptops at work never included a dvd drive. It was optional The Iceman Cometh I still use a DVD/CD drive with my computers to transfer music or copy DVDs so not sure where you get the idea it’s irrelevant because you personally haven’t bothered. DVD and CDs are still being used in the market today. Not everything revolves around a download modsuperstar You’re in the minority. Physical media has been in a death spiral for a decade now. beyond Everything has to do with money not because they want to “push others to use new tech” Think about it, they basically made it inconvenient to expand the physical memory of the device. To get that convenience back people need to buy the more expensive version which includes more capacity. This was the same reason they don’t include the micro SD card slot in their phones. It’s a pricing strategy so they can charge more for physical memory (which they can’t do by including SD card slots). BetelgeuseOrion they are pushing new tech with last years CPUs, DDR3 ram (from F-ing 2013) and garbage AMD cards? yeah okay, Bob Loblaw Found the apple sheeple. moviegab Constructive argument…. Tom Gray Found the Android guy who only knows to repeat what all his brethren say with no substance. Funny you call Apple people sheep, yet all Android people have the exact same lines they use over and over. Careful how you point fingers, your group isn’t much different from the Apple group. Tom Gray I’m an Apple fan, but it’s really hard to defend them here. As I stated in another comment, amongst other things, I cannot even plug in my Apple iPhone into my Apple Computer without adapters or a special cable. It’s a really bad move, in a series of bad moves. I love their computers, I just think this was a mistake. PeterDTown Yeah, and now I was forced to purchase an external dvd drive and cart it around with me all the time. Awesome “progress.” beyond “So we think there’s a path forward where you can use a physical adapter if you want, or do wireless transfer” – um so basically exactly the setup they had before, only less convenient for the user. Way to go Apple. And how does having a card reader connected to a USB dongle hanging off the side of your laptop better than an integrated card reader where the SD card only sticks out part way? WeirdG Wait…. so they don’t include USB 3.0 or an SD card reader, but they still include a headphone jack in the MacBook Pro. Courageous = Inconsistent? Tom Gray Yup. I wanted to upgrade, but I’m doubting now. Buying an Apple Computer on which I cannot connect my iPhone to… seems kinda redundant in many areas. My biggest complaint is let say I get a bad update and have to restore my iPhone, which requires me to plug it in to the computer… whoops… lol Dean Aronson They sell USB-C to lightning cables. In fact you can then plug said cable into your macbook’s charging brick. Not the worst. BetelgeuseOrion obviously he is an ignorant fool, UHS3 SD cards copy at over 90MB/s, even the cheap garbage ones, the good ones are a little faster camera’s (as well as smartphones) can only sustain around 7-8MB/s consistently on wireless if you are a professional, you would be shooting raw and if your card is 64GB in size a card reader should be able to copy all of the data in 12-15 minutes, a wireless camera would need 2.6 hours and thats not stable at all, no wireless connections are due to interference from other sources. how the F is that a replacement? it seems more retarded than “Pro” to me Brad Fortin Now imagine if camera companies actually invested in storage and updated connections: Cameras with internal storage sizes and speeds that match modern computers, with a USB 3.1 or Thunderbolt 3 connection that allow you to connect your camera to the new MacBook Pro and transfer gigs of photos and videos in the same amount of time it takes to remove the SD card from the camera and put it into a laptop. Better yet if the camera came with some sort of quick-transfer dock: Put the camera onto the dock, wait a few moments for the files to transfer, take the camera off, and keep shooting with all your storage space available. Goran Mihajlović Which is obviously not a thing and God knows how long before it will be. Let’s not shift the blame over to camera companies, much as their slowness to adapt to connectivity advances and good UX remains an issue. Brad Fortin Is it really shifting the blame if they’re the ones who haven’t kept up with modern technology? If camera companies were still using film, would it be Apple’s fault for not including a film strip scanner? Of course not. BetelgeuseOrion Imagine if apple actually gave half a fart and used USB C on the iPhone, WOW! no more incompatibility and fragmentation between the MBP and iPhone. Brad Fortin But then the millions of users who switched from 30-pin to Lightning would cry foul because Apple’s changing their connector for the second time in 15 years. brent Sure they would cry foul and throw a few hissy fits but at the end of the day they would still continue to buy apple products so its not really that big of a deal… People are still flocking to the iphone 7 even though everyone complained about the headphone jack being removed.. Brad Fortin That’s because the majority of iPhone users just use the headphones that came in the box. It also helps that before the launch of the iPhone 7 sales of wireless headphones finally eclipsed sales of wired headphones, making it more likely that anyone buying headphones for the new iPhone 7 will be buying wireless headphones. They would cry foul and throw the same kind of hissy fits that people are throwing right now over the removal of the SD card slot. What a coincidence. Dean Aronson I think people would overlook another change, if they could have only one type of cord for all your apple devices. I know I would. Brad Fortin You would, but the hundreds of millions of people who don’t own any other Apple devices would not. Patrick O’Rourke Or Apple could just include an SD card slot. Brad Fortin Yes, because it’s up to other manufacturers to make up for the deficiencies of camera companies. brent no its not,BUT SD card slots continue to be a standard on almost all laptops made by all OEMs, so why does apple always have to think they are cool…? Apple needs to get over themselves and start going along with standards… how idiotic is it to have a USB TYPE C connector on the laptop but not an Apple Lightening connector? Oh wait lets come up with an adapter and not include it as standard with a close to 3G’s laptop so we can gouge our loyal fanboys even more. Apple is shameless when it comes to screwing their customers over, honestly could any company in the world be more money hungry? I Hope Apple dies a slow and painful death.. Brad Fortin It’s not about being cool, it’s about including the features that the majority of their customers need. Apple has the usage statistics for their machines, and all their ports, so they know when a feature is being used and when it’s not being used. That’s why tvOS didn’t initially include Bluetooth keyboard support: They looked at the usage statistics of the AppleTV and noticed two things: 1) Only a small number of users used Bluetooth keyboards, and; 2) The number of Bluetooth keyboard users dropped down to almost 0 during WWDC, meaning the majority of those people were developers. Since the majority of AppleTV users weren’t using Bluetooth keyboards they could delay that feature and prioritize other features for the launch. Likewise, I’m sure they looked at the usage statistics of the SD card slot in current MacBooks Pro, noticed that only a small, obnoxiously vocal minority of people used it, and decided that it wasn’t worth including anymore. FlamesFan89 I’d much rather have camera companies focus on optics and sensors, and capture speeds, you know, camera things. simphf God dammit Gump you must have an IQ of a 160. Brad Fortin Why can’t they focus on all of it? Apple manages to have great displays without being a display company, they manage to have super-fast SSDs without being a storage company, etc. It’s possible to include good features without specifically being in those businesses. FlamesFan89 If only Apple could have a laptop that had an SD slot… I guess they were too focused on using old RAM. Brad Fortin Skylake doesn’t support LPDDR4, and Kaby Lake is only available in U-class configurations right now, so Apple would have either had to use desktop-class RAM and end up with 2 hours of battery life like the Oryx Pro or XPS 15 (touch model), which would have resulted in even more whinging and moaning, or used under-performing low-power dual-core chips that definitely aren’t made for Pro machines. The RAM situation is all on Intel, not Apple, but feel free to continue misplacing your frustrations while ignoring the reality of the CPU market at the moment. FlamesFan89 But you said that Apple is capable of focusing on many things. Why couldn’t they have figured out this too? hmmmm, seems they just aren’t very good at this. Brad Fortin Are you saying Apple is capable of including a CPU that doesn’t exist? FlamesFan89 No, I’m saying that they should have invented it, because they are just that amazing and courageous. Brad Fortin I’m sure they’ll have their own laptop-class CPU soon and won’t have to deal with this sort of problem. FlamesFan89 It’s about freaking time! BetelgeuseOrion Skylake doesnt support DDR4? what in the hell are you talking about? my laptop (GS43VR) has a Skylake i7 6700HQ CPU (same as the highest end MBP) and 16GB of DDR4 2400MHz, upgradable to 32GB if i want. literally all gaming laptops now have quad core i7 (skylake 6700HQ if not 6700HK) and DDR4 ram, nobody uses DDR3L because its old junk from 2013 DDR3 = 1.5v DDR3L = 1.35v DDR4 = 1.2v going with DDR4 automatically uses less power and has more speed, does it cost more? slightly, $58 for 8GB DDR3 vs $65 for 8GB DDR4. i’m sure most users would be okay with a $7 increase since you know, the price bump was about $500 for LESS functionality Brad Fortin *LP* DDR4. DDR4 and LPDDR4 are two different things, and DDR4L is also a different class of memory. LPDDR memory also costs significantly more than standard DDR memory. Do you seriously not know there are 3 different classes of memory? Your laptop uses desktop RAM, which kills battery life, like I mentioned above. What’s the battery life on your laptop? I’m guessing it’s significantly less than the 10 hours of battery life on the MacBook Pro. Do Do Your fanboyism knows no bounds. Brad Fortin Feel free to explain how Apple is responsible for camera companies’ choices when it comes to offloading the pictures from cameras. brent Brad do you never tire of Pumping Apples tires? Holy S*it man! I hope they have you on the Payroll.. Brad Fortin Feel free to explain how Apple is responsible for camera companies’ choices when it comes to offloading the pictures from cameras. I’ll wait. PeterDTown They’re not responsible for it, but they are responsible for providing a way for consumers to utilize the current offering. Your ideas are great in the fantasy world where camera manufacturers already offer those options and everyone with a camera can afford to upgrade. Brad Fortin There are also many cameras that use CompactFlash, is Apple also responsible for providing a way for consumers to utilize that offering? What about Memory Sticks from Sony? Where do you draw the arbitrary line? Is Apple responsible for maintaining a port for every legacy standard in existence? Nonsense. PeterDTown You’re right, they’re not responsible for supporting anything. It just seems like a smart business decision to continue to support the connections for devices that the majority of your users use. I know I’m glad I got my MBP last year. By the time my I need my next update maybe the apple offering will be back in line with my needs. If I had to buy a laptop now I wouldn’t be touching a MBP, despite a strong preference for osx. Brad Fortin “It just seems like a smart business decision to continue to support the connections for devices that the majority of your users use.” And therein lies the crux of the issue. The people who are complaining about the removal of the SD card slot are the ones most likely to use it. However, Apple has the usage statistics for their machines, and all their ports. They know when a feature is being used, and when it’s not being used. That’s why tvOS didn’t initially include Bluetooth keyboard support: They looked at the usage statistics of the AppleTV and noticed two things: 1) Only a small number of users used Bluetooth keyboards, and; 2) The number of Bluetooth keyboard users dropped down to almost 0 during WWDC, meaning the majority of those people were developers. Since the majority of AppleTV users weren’t using Bluetooth keyboards they could delay that feature and prioritize other features for the launch. Likewise, I’m sure they looked at the usage statistics of the SD card slot in current MacBooks Pro, noticed the usage was only a small minority, and decided that it wasn’t worth including anymore. jay BRAD is the new RENE Bob Loblaw Schiller lives in some fantasy world where everything works miraculously over wi-fi at ridiculously fast speeds without the need to worry about data caps and overage charges. Stick it where the sun don’t shine schiller. The Iceman Cometh Apple is fast becoming a company that is losing touch with its customers and even the long-time loyalists are getting sick and tired of being told how they can use these devices, particularly given the prices they are being asked to shell out. Schiller is demonstrating much the same arrogance that afflicted Blackberry and so one can only hope they don’t end up the same way. Captain Henry Morgan “Because of a couple of things. One, it’s a bit of a cumbersome slot. You’ve got this thing sticking halfway out.”. There is one called MicroSD where it doesn’t have to stick halfway out. I bought Surface Pro 4 over MacBook Pro with no regret! I love it! The Iceman Cometh Same here. No regrets although I still use an iMac and iPad for other purposes. Captain Henry Morgan Ditto! iPhone 6s and still have the first generation iPad mini which still works but started feeling that it needs to be replaced pretty soon! The Iceman Cometh Admittedly I’m using the 12.9′ iPad Pro. hehe. It’s a fine beast but not one that I feel totally measures up to the SP4 in all capabilities. SuperFist Phil The Shill! Russ Smith I use the SD slot to transfer video to my MacBook without having to mess with a USB connection or worse a wireless connection. You said it: “Anyone who has attempted to transfer photos to their laptop… know(s) that [wireless transfer is useful as an alternative] is not true.” Actually, the thing about alternatives is that they should be alternatives, not replacements by fiat. Apple seems unusually comfortable with telling consumers what they need. It strikes me as odd that Microsoft, HP, Lenovo et. al. can figure out how to put video out, a microSD slot, and a host of other options on their relatively thin and light laptops and Apple can’t. Of course, Apple still hasn’t figured out how to do a touch screen on anything other than tablets and phones (which are smaller… weird.) Roger Apple definitely can, but just won’t do it so they can sell you dongles. My 5 year old Sony mirrorless camera doesn’t have Wifi functionality, period. I was never an Apple fan and this takes me even further away from the brand. I was at an Apple store recently to kill some time and kinda liked their new iPhones, but I realized about iTunes and walked out the door. nidzillaftw I primarily use the microSD card slot in my phone and tablet as extra storage capacity. It doesn’t stick out, even on the tablet, it’s perfectly flush when fully inserted. It pretty much faction’s as a secondary hard drive, greatly increasing the storage capacity of both devices. With 1 Tb cards coming in the near future, I don’t think I would ever consider buying a laptop/tablet/phone that didn’t have a micro SD card slot. haesslich Are we sure Schiller isn’t a Microsoft inserted Trojan who’s job is to sink Apple the way Nokia was by Elop? Do Do A little early to be sure but I’m fairly certain I’m going to done with Macbook Pro’s. I may have to look into if there’s been any meaningful headway made into locking down Windows spyware OS. More and more I’m thinking Apple may be getting out of the computer business and focusing on service and Iphones and accessories. Hopefully they license macOS. As I’ve said repeatedly, macOS on a Surface Book would be ideal. The Iceman Cometh I don’t think there is any indication they are through with computers, even more so since they still sell quite well and no one is calling for the end of the business. Just because a few of us don’t care for this iteration of the Macbook Pro doesn’t really mean anything in the grand scheme of things. Do Do Last I read even chromebooks outsell Macs now. I don’t see that changing with this iteration. I’m more inclined to buy last years 13″ Air than this pro. Omar Well, consumers can tell Schiller he’s wrong by not buying the product, but that probably won’t happen. In the next iteration of Macbook, you’ll likely need a dongle to use your dongles, if Apple keeps this up. jay i am not able to follow apples path anymore. USB C for all thats it. maybe mac safe would be great. but SD card is a must for a PRO user. and all you guys out there I NEED A SD CARD READER AND A GOOD KEYBOARD. 32 GB RAM AND A GRAPHIC CARD AND NOT MA CHEAP CHIP. thank you conversation over. mizkitty Only the 2 USB type-C on the left side are full speed.

It's so good, according to the Apple execs, that you're probably wondering how and when Apple will bring its shiniest new feature to other Macs. I can't help you with the "when" part, but a Redditor has made a mockup of what a standalone wireless keyboard with a touch bar might look like. The answer? Gorgeous as hell. DON'T MISS: New evidence shines light on a big advantage Galaxy S8 may have over iPhone 8 The concept is simple: take Apple's existing Magic Keyboard, add the Touch Bar along the top, a number pad on the side, and a USB-C port for charging. Aesthetically, it doesn't change much from Apple's existing Magic Keyboard, but it would add a lot of the new functionality that Apple is building into macOS. It would also let Apple easily compete with the Surface Studio, Microsoft's touchscreen all-in-one that it just released as a competitor to the iMac. Apple hasn't updated the iMac to compete yet, but adding a new touch-friendly keyboard to the lineup would maybe deter some customers from fleeing to Windows. Building a Magic Keyboard with a touch bar wouldn't be the easiest thing in the world from a technology standpoint, though. The Touch Bar requires its own separate chip running watchOS to function, so Apple would have to build that in as well. Handling all the data transfer between computer and Touch Bar would also probably exceed the limits of Bluetooth, so the keyboard would need a Wi-Fi chip (or a physical wire) to work. That poses its own set of issues around cost and battery life. There's no doubting that it would be a niche product. The regular old Magic Keyboard already sells for $130, so adding an OLED touch screen and new chips would easily push that price up to $200-300. That's a tough sell for a fancy keyboard, but then again, just look at it.

The latest update to iOS includes two new emojis that look a lot like the late David Bowie. According to Billboard, the emojis Apple has chosen to represent the singer profession are modeled after Bowie’s look on the 1973 album, Aladdin Sane. The male singer features blue hair combed over the right eye and a red and blue recreation of Bowie’s lightning bolt makeup over the face. The female singer is similar, only with pink hair and a pink and blue lightning bolt. It’s a wonderful tribute to the late musical legend, who passed away last January, shortly after the release of his final album, Blackstar. RIP David Bowie: See His Life in Photos 21 Photos » You can check out all the new emoji introduced in the update via a tweet from Good Morning America.  New emojis coming to next iPhone update!

Affected Apple TV models are only capable of opening Computers, Music, and Settings, with all other channels being non-accessible. This means users wanting to access channels such as Hulu, Netflix, or YouTube are unable to. Unfortunately, resetting the Apple TV, router, or restarting the Apple TV does not seem to fix this issue. Switching the region on the device provides a temporary solution but the issue ultimately returns after a while. Some users report that changing the DNS may fix the issue but it doesn’t seem to work for all users. Fortunately, not all Apple TV’s are affected by this issue, but it appears to be a pretty big issue. It also only impacts the second and third-generation Apple TV as the fourth-generation works just fine. Via a Reddit user, Apple’s support staff says a software update is in the works and that Apple is aware of the issue. Apple says the issue should be resolved within the next few hours.

Affected Apple TV models are only able to display Computers, Music, and Settings, with no other channel options available. Customers who are seeing the issue have had all of their menu options suddenly disappear, leaving them unable to watch Netflix, Hulu, and other Apple TV channels. Image via MacRumors reader Gabbisonn This seems to be a bug that's been around for awhile, but has become more prevalent over the last day or two. MacRumors has received several complaints via email, and there are threads outlining the problem both on our forums and on Reddit. Restarting the Apple TV, resetting a router, and resetting the Apple TV don't seem to work. A region change offers a temporary solution, but ultimately, the channels disappear again for many users. Some users have partially fixed the issue by changing DNS settings, but this doesn't work for all users. A MacRumors reader describes the problem: All I see is a computer and settings option. In the settings option I have access to everything except the main menu setting. There's absolutely nothing in there as an option. I've restarted my Apple TV as well as my AirPort Extreme. I've reset the Apple TV and I inserted all the info back in like my iCloud acct etc. it obviously is logging onto the Internet since I was able to connect my iCloud account. One other strange thing is that my iTunes won't recognize the Apple TV when I plug it in directly to my Mac mini via a USB cable. It just doesn't show up. What the heck happened? Apple do you have an explanation for this one?Not all Apple TV users are affected by the issue, but it appears to be fairly widespread. Only the Apple TV 2 and 3 are impacted -- the fourth-generation Apple TV is functioning fine. Apple's support staff told a Reddit user that a fix was in the works, and to expect a software update in the near future. A MacRumors reader received similar information, with Apple suggesting a fix would be pushed within the next few hours.

As tech becomes smaller and batteries become more capable, this is definitely a direction Apple will take at some point, but we’re just too early in development. That’s where a startup comes in with CMRA, a band for Apple Watch that adds not one, but two HD cameras to the strap, allowing you to easily and quickly shoot photos or record videos. Well, in theory anyway. CMRA is getting lots of press coverage today, and for good reasons. It’s showcasing a product that appears to be really cool and maybe even useful. That is if you can stomach the price and wait until next year for the product to hopefully launch. The CMRA features two HD cameras embedded in the band. There is an outward-facing 8MP camera, and a self-facing 2MP camera. At this time, it is unclear to me if both cameras or only the outward-facing one can record videos, but either way, it’s pretty cool. Why would you need CMRA anyway? CMRA’s website suggests it’s just a more practical product… The smartphone has become our primary camera. With all of its conveniences, the smartphone is big, and it lives in your pocket. It takes time to retrieve, quickly runs out of battery, and is far from rugged. What if you could capture more and carry less? What if capturing a moment were as easy as blinking your eye? You wouldn’t need to step out of the moment in order to save it. And you wouldn’t need to have an expensive, delicate device in your hand every time you wish to preserve or share a memory. I’m not sure if launching an app on my Apple Watch offers a better experience than swiping left on my iPhone Lock screen, but I could be wrong. If you’re going to pack two cameras and a battery in a strap, you know it’s got to be clunky and bulky. Sure enough! As much as the designers tried to hide the bulkiness of the tech inside the strap, it’s just awfully bulky, as you can see on some of the shots. And then there is the price and availability. You can pre-order one today for $149, or wait until the product officially launches, at which point, the CMRA will cost you $249. The kicker has to be that the product isn’t estimated to ship until Spring 2017. Phew! As you might have guessed, I’m terribly bearish on this bulky, overpriced, unpractical, and unneeded device that may or may not ever ship. To me the CMRA is the solution to a problem no one has, but it’s definitely a good attempt at making something really original. It’s great on paper, but not so much in practice. Cameras will eventually make their way to the Apple Watch. It’s inevitable, but the time hasn’t come yet. Certainly not at this price, and certainly not under this form factor. If you think I’m missing the point, you’ll be glad to know you can pre-order the CMRA today.

How can you send a video through iMessage on the watch? Wouldn’t Apple have to set that up? Why advertise something that may require a third party messaging app. Also, why would they sell a stand that doesn’t work as an alarm clock. I am pretty sure a lot of people use their watch as night clocks. therealjjohnson I assume it would send as text. If the person you are texting has an iPhone then it will just go through as an iMessage. Just like another video you would take. I don’t think they need any special access or third party messaging app. I don’t think so at least… P1nGu1n0 That’s what throws me off because the iMessage app on the watch has 4 buttons. Speech to text, emoji, the heart rate sensor and scribble. Would a cámara button show up if u connect one? therealjjohnson I think via whatever app they use there would be a share/send via text option. You would send from that app vs sending from iMessage itself. Sorta like how different pic collage apps allow you to send your picture to text via the share sheet. Not sure if app developers have that option with watchOS or not though. P1nGu1n0 I agree with the “never buy” in the title. The apps are slow on the watch. Personally I would not want to bother waiting on an app to load. Also how compatible will this be in the long run with software updates? It’s a cool concept but not really useful. therealjjohnson Yeah, unless it used FaceTime it’s a no buy for me too. I need someone to actually be able to video chat with in order for this to be useful. P1nGu1n0 Agreed I could use that but I would hope that no 3rd party FaceTime app would be necessary Riley Freeman glide has its own video chat app in the app store. Is actually more compatible since glide is avaialble on android as well as ios techfreak23 I don’t believe there is currently an option for developers to send images or videos via MMS or iMessage or even attach media to any message for that matter. I could be wrong though as I’ve never actually gone through the full Watch documentation, but I have not seen any that do that. Riley Freeman i can tell you my friends and i have a groupchat on whats app and when we see a hot girl, we try and snap a pic and share. We dont do anything malicious or post it on the internet. Everything remains private in the group chat. So the camera feature definitely has its uses. Im sure hteres advantages if you want to record someone doing something without them noticing. Could be something silly or something criminal. So there is definitely a use. The problem here is the price because the apple watch is already high priced. The ship date is also pretty far. If it had said early 2017 or holidays that would be more appealing. therealjjohnson Apple watch bands cost just as much as this though. My blue leather band ran me $150. I would feel a little better spending $150 on a band if it had 2 cameras and a charger in it. Riley Freeman completely agree but there are the cheaper silicone bands. I am going to pre-order this. This will be the first time i ever pre-order something that’s in the kickstarter/gofundme etc period. I usually wait until its delivered. don’t like the fact that if they do not deliver the products, you dont get a refund. Rowan09 I’ve order something in a kickstarter and still haven’t received anything since last year. george So you want a camera on your watch so you can have an easier time being a creep? Riley Freeman you call it what u want. Im nort hurting anyone. If that bothers you, thats you’re problem to deal with it.

It was especially virulent when Final Cut 7 was replaced with Final Cut Pro X about five years ago and, despite three major updates and dozens of minor ones, it would seem that there are still those who delight in making that unfounded claim. This past weekend, I attended what was billed as the Creative Summit in Cupertino, CA where we talked about all things workflow with a very clear focus on FCPX. It was probably not much of a coincidence that it came a day after the release of FCPX 10.3 which, quite obviously, provided much of excitement for the conference. We even got a trip over to the Apple campus to get a couple of presentations on FCPX, Motion and Compressor and to get hands-on with the new hardware that was introduced on the prior Thursday. All in all, a good time was had by all and attendees seemed pretty impressed overall. Which brings me to the "Apple had abandoned the pro market" claim. On Friday morning, some of the production team from Focus and Whiskey Tango Foxtrot were on a panel discussing their innovative approach to post workflow on those two films, using previous versions of FCPX. Jan Kovac, the editor, and Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, the directors, were there to discuss their process in making these two films and how it improved their results and saved them money. This is nothing new insofar as there has been plenty of discussion on the web about this and Michael Cioni's Light Iron Digital famously held an event to discuss it, videos of which can be found here: https://vimeo.com/161710321 https://vimeo.com/161709369 In the course of their presentation and discussion, these guys noted that throughout the post process for these films, the Apple FCPX development team could often be found sitting in the post suite watching, listening, and answering questions. They made a clear point that this wasn't just one or two courtesy visits but an ongoing happening whereby the folks from Cupertino would all gather in LA to sit in on the sessions. And they gathered information about what worked and what didn't; what future capabilities might be welcomed. So, in an attempt to get them on record, I stood and asked the question - in their opinion, based on their own experience and observation, was Apple at all likely to abandon pro users? John Requa actually seemed a little surprised by the question but answered quickly and without hesitation. He was vehement in his view that Apple was indeed, there for pro users and he seemed very confident that many more improvements were likely to be in the pipeline going forward. These guys are committed to using FCPX for their future products (I won't attempt to start a war by revealing what they think about going back to Avid - lol) and they believe Apple will be there every step of the way for them. But, it didn't end there. Almost before John could finish his response to my question, the product manager for FCPX stood up in the back of the room and said that he could answer that question definitively on behalf of Apple and that, NO, Apple was not abandoning pro users and, in fact, version 10.3 is just one stop on the way to even more iterations, more improvements and more capabilities. I know there will be disbelievers. Even assurances from Apple itself won't convince some. I have to say I really don't "get it," but I know that's the case. I respect that folks like Avid or Premier and don't want to use FCPX, but what I don't understand is all the haters that come out and clearly don't even understand the FCPX paradigm - but diss it anyway. But, whatever... hopefully, some FCPX users who may have been nervous about Apple's future plans for FCPX and pro users can rest a little more easily. Thanks for listening.

I think what's happening is that people diss FCPX without having ever tried it, or if they tried it, it was only version 10.0.0 and they never actually edited a project with it. 10.3 is a completely different animal than 10.2, and 10.2 was a completely different animal than 10.0. I've edited only a few projects with 10.0-10.2.3, but now am seriously considering 10.3 to be my main editor. It would be nice if Apple resurrected Color (or a replacement for Color) within FCPX, and even integrated Logic Pro X more, so we could have an all-in-one app for everything. And even Motion. Really, I don't see the reason for separate apps for everything these days. BMD is doing some great things making Resolve an editor as well as color finisher, but it's really not there yet as an editing platform.     #3   Carey Lee Coffey View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Senior Member Join Date Apr 2009 Location Los Angeles Posts 1,645 11-02-2016, 11:48 AM 10.3 is the best NLE on the planet.

They've demonstrated editing 4K video on a MacBook Pro. Why do you need to edit more than 4K? Most are going to create proxies at 1080p anyway, then conform back to the original RAW (4K, 5K, 6k, or 8K) for color. All the current Macs are more than powerful enough for editing. And the Mac Pro is more powerful than that. If you need more, add an eGPU or build a hackintosh until the next Mac Pro comes out. There's nothing new happening here with Apple. There was a long period where Apple wasn't really upgrading a line of computers. The reason was because they were overhauling that line with a completely new design. That's always been the case with the iMac, MacBook Pro, and Mac Pro. We've seen a completely new design for the MacBook Pro, which explains the lack of updates for the past 1.5 years. I would be the next Mac Pro will see a new design as well, and is not being abandoned.     #7   Hrvoje Simic View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Visit Homepage Senior Member Join Date Jan 2007 Posts 3,594 11-02-2016, 12:09 PM That is true. Apple is not abandoning pro users. It is not abandoning professional florists, real estate brokers, lawyers, home business owners, journalists, professional interior designers, musicians, graphic designers, iOS app developers, writers, copywriters and many others using Apple solutions in their profession. If you happen to be a professional video editor you are stuck between a rock and algorithm mess place, if you work in post and need a post machine for tasking UHD workflow you'll learn to compensate, add more external gear for performance, turn up air conditioning when needed and hope renders turn out fine 5 mins before heading to broadcast/DCP. If you are a professional photographer you'll just use a card reader and other software and pay premium for OS and product design. For each of those cases you'll have a mobile 4x 40Gb/s TB3 solution to run two TB3 RAID arrays and two 5K screens on batteries if needed, in a sea of 10-50MB/s standard USB drives, 100MB/s 2.5" and 200MB/s 3.5" standard USB disks, standard USB printers, scanners and standard HDMI monitors, projectors and TVs.

If there was, everyone would be clamoring to use it and there would be very little debate. The NLE market of 2016 is a bit different than say 1995 or 2005. Avid is still used at the high end on a lot of features and television work. Adobe Premiere is being used across a wide variety of genres and markets, including corporate, commercial, features, and docs. Premiere is often the choice when the full complement of Adobe tools are needed such as After Effects and Photoshop. Final Cut Pro X is still evolving and perhaps there is still uncertainty about whether it fits some of the workflows that editors and AEs are used to (read efficiency). For one, it operates very differently than the other major NLEs. And secondly, it is tied to an Apple ecosystem which absolutely scares the heck out of a lot of people right now. Have some projects used it, absolutely! Has it gone mainstream in features and television? No. However, I don't see that as a negative right now. As of today, November 2nd 2016, I am using Avid and FCPX as my primary NLEs. Avid for the long form projects that need a known, robust workflow. And FCPX for everything else. I know which one I have more fun editing in right now. It has sped up my efficiency with quick turnaround projects. When I first started using it, the magnetic timeline was challenging to get used to. Over time, I feel I have learned to use it when I need it, turn it off when i don't. FCPX version 10.3 looks like it will be a nice step forward. I am anxious to try it. Yes, FCPX is tied to Apple hardware. This forum has a lot of computer nerds (and I mean that in a very positive way) and they don't like to be pigeonholed by hardware. They want hardware they can turn up to 11. FCPX is optimized for recent generations of Macbook Pros, nMPs and iMacs. For those who don't need the hardware to be bleeding edge/capable of twenty streams of 8K, and simply just need to get work done editing really just comes down to arranging clips in a way that tells the story and I've always believed that all you need to do that is enough resolution to make out what the image is. I've seen many films edited with Avid AVR2 and they had no trouble telling a story. But, it's hard to ignore Apple's company structure, which has clearly been built on consumer products over the past several years. I think some healthy skepticism is understandable in this case. But I also believe Apple has always tried to stay connected to Hollywood throughout their history. And perhaps FCPX and Logic allow them to connect to those creative fields that were a big part of their success in years past. So, they may indeed be invested in these products for years to come. And perhaps FCPX will be the NLE for everyone, especially at the current price of $299, a one time purchase.

Having the ability to track audio is huge, but did they really still not add a mixer? I know you can mix on each channel, but a global mixer should be included. Maybe I haven't found it yet, just started to poke around, but if it is not there, they should add that to the list. Also was hoping they would add a feather to the crop instead of having to use a plug in. But overall, a very stable product that gives great results. I am strictly Mac Book Pro so don't need a desktop, but understand people's frustration on there not being upgrades on that front.

The cheapest MacBook Pro is the base 13-inch model priced at $1,500, which is a high price to pay for its relatively middling specs. And it doesn't have the fancy new Touch Bar, either. Of course, you get the comprehensive Apple ecosystem with a MacBook Pro, and the Mac operating system is good enough to warrant some kind of markup. Yet when you see that you can buy a Windows 10 laptop that's thinner, lighter, and boasts far superior specs for $500 less, the shining allure of Apple's ecosystem is suddenly dimmer. So I've compiled the five best alternatives that can wipe the floor with the new base MacBook Pro based on specs, all while keeping a slim, sleek, lightweight design. Some on the list can even outperform the more powerful 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models with the Touch Bar, too. You'll notice most of the laptops on this list have the powerful Core i7 processors from Intel — I recommend you buy computers with the i7 for the best performance today as well as five years down the line. There are cheaper models with specs that are comparable to the new base MacBook Pro, but you're better off getting one of these options. Check them out: View As: One Page Slides Dell XPS 13 (non-touch) Dell If you're willing to spend close to the base MacBook Pro's $1,500 price tag, you'd do well with $1,300 Dell's XPS 13 (without a touch screen). It has a far superior and newer processor for $200 less, as well as a decent graphics card for casual gaming and other visual applications, as well as the ability to hook up to multiple monitors. Specs: • Core i7 7500U • 8 GB RAM • 256 GB SSD • NVidia GTX 960M 2 GB GDDR5 • 15.6-inch 1080p screen • 2.7 pounds • 1 USB-C port, can also be used for charging • 2 USB 3 ports $1,300 from Dell Acer Aspire S13 Acer For $400 less than the new base MacBook Pro, you get a slightly thinner, more powerful laptop with more storage and USB 3 ports. It also has a USB-C port for future-proofing. Specs: • Core i7 6500U 2.5 GHz • 8 GB RAM • 512 GB SSD • 13.3-inch 1080p touch-screen • 3 pounds • 1 USB-C port • 2 USB 3 ports $1,000 from Amazon Samsung Notebook 9 (13-inch) Samsung/Amazon The $940 Samsung Notebook 9 (13-inch) offers similar specs, but comes in an even thinner and lighter package than the new base MacBook Pro for more than $500 less. It truly makes the base MacBook Pro look like a bad deal. It doesn't have USB-C ports, which are useful for charging devices and transferring data simultaneously, but since USB-C is not quite mainstream just yet, this is OK for now. Specs: • Sixth-generation Core i5 2.5 GHz • 8 GB RAM • 256 GB SSD • 13.3-inch 1080p screen • 1.9 pounds • 2 USB 3 ports $939 on Amazon HP Spectre X360 13t touch HP/YouTube The HP Spectre X360 13t sports a superior and newer processor while being thinner and lighter than the new base MacBook Pro. It also comes with two USB-C ports as well as a regular USB 3 port. The X360's screen can also rotate 360 degrees. Specs: • Core i7 7200U 2.7 GHz • 8 GB RAM • 256 GB SSD • 13.3-inch 1080p touch-screen • 2.85 pounds • 2 USB-C ports • 1 USB 3 port $1,050 from HP HP Spectre HP The HP's Spectre is beautifully designed, thinner, and lighter than the new base MacBook Pro, all while sporting better specs and a lower price tag. And it comes with one more USB-C port than the new base MacBook Pro, too. Specs: • Core i7 7500U 3.5 GHz • 8 GB RAM • 256 GB SSD • 13.3-inch 1080p screen • 2.45 pounds • 3 USB-C ports (one with Thunderbolt) $1,250 from HP SEE ALSO: Apple’s marketing boss says the MacBook Pro ditched a crucial port for photographers because it’s ‘cumbersome’ More: Features Apple MacBook Pro PCs Windows 10 Laptops facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru 5 cheaper and better alternatives to Apple's expensive new MacBook Pros 5 cheaper and better alternatives to Apple's expensive new MacBook Pros The new MacBook Pros that Apple introduced last...

Technavio defines an emerging trend as a factor that has the potential to significantly impact the market and contribute to its growth or decline. Biometrics is widely being implemented in mobile devices to control accessibility. The Touch ID in Apple devices, which allows end-users to unlock their devices and make payments for their purchases on Apple digital media stores, uses fingerprint biometrics. Further, an individual's fingerprint data is neither stored on Apple servers nor on iCloud, but on the chip inside the device. This avoids instances of privacy intrusion and fortifies security. Mobile companies like Motorola and Samsung have also incorporated biometric fingerprint sensors in their devices to manage the accessibility of applications and data. The global biometrics market in the BFSI sector is anticipated to witness impressive growth and will post a staggering CAGR of close to 20% over the forecast period. Amrita Choudhury, a lead analyst from Technavio, specializing in research on automatic identification systems sector, says, "With increase in instances of security breaches and transaction frauds, the need for highly secure identification and verification systems has increased manifold in the BFSI sector. Biometrics authentication is considered as an ideal solution to address the security issues in the BFSI sector because it relies on the unique physiological features of the individuals." Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=53285 Technavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. The top four emerging trends driving the global biometrics market in BFSI sector according to Technavio ICT research analysts are: Adoption of vein recognition in ATMs and POS terminals Multimodal biometrics in BFSI sector Proliferation of facial recognition in BFSI sector Introduction of voice biometrics in BFSI sector Adoption of vein recognition in ATMs and POS terminals Banks and financial institutions in the developing countries such as India, China, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa are ready to adopt vein recognition biometrics to verify the identity of their customers. Also, in the global BFSI sector, vein recognition is likely to find greater adoption in the next two years, specifically in m-banking as it is accurate and user-friendly. The major application areas of vein recognition biometrics in the BFSI sector includes door security, log-in management for PCs, ATMs, POS terminals, and banking transactions. Multimodal biometrics in BFSI sector Multimodal biometrics uses a combination of two or more biometric technologies to identify and verify individuals. In many situations, one form of biometric identification does not yield accurate and exact match of the identity of an individual. The combination of biometrics like fingerprint and finger vein pattern or a combination of fingerprint, iris, and voice pattern, is more reliable, accurate, secure, and capable of avoiding spoofing attacks. This is likely to lead to higher adoption of this system in the BFSI sector in countries across the world. Proliferation of facial recognition in BFSI sector Facial recognition biometric technology is gaining traction in the BFSI sector to provide clients secure access to their bank accounts eliminating the need for a username and password. 3D facial recognition technology is further influenced by its increasing demand in ATMs, mobile payment at POS, and online banking services. "The use of 3D biometric facial recognition in the global BFSI sector is gaining popularity and is likely to be adopted in other areas of the business like loan approval, personalized assistance, as well as determination of blacklist customers," says Amrita. Introduction of voice biometrics in BFSI sector The usage of various internet networks for financial transactions have increased the vulnerability of financial accounts and user data. Further, customers are expected to remember numerous passwords, PINs, and card numbers to verify themselves and proceed to make secure transactions, which is rather inconvenient. Therefore, voice biometrics is being used in the financial sector that will provide secure access to bank accounts and will help end-users to carry out financial transactions by verifying their identity with their voice. For instance, in 2014, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank deployed FreeSpeech, a voice biometric solution from Nuance Communications, for secure and easy authentication for customers through their unique voice pattern. It supports banking transactions through mobile devices and languages like Arabic, English, and Hindi.

Head-to-Head Is the new Macbook Pro a massive disappointment? Head-to-Head by Tom Honeyands 02 November 2016 0 shares Read Comments Apple have launched the latest Macbook Pros, featuring a refined design, updated processors, a new Touch Bar and more. Are these improvements enough to justify the new higher price and is there really any reason to buy one? Andy (@AndyVan) and Tom (@TheTechChap) go head-to-head to find out. Andy says... Lately, Apple seems to be in a habit of making everything very inconvenient. From removing the 3.5mm headphone jack in the iPhone to replacing every port on the new Macbook Pro with a USB Type C. Now I need an adaptor for my hard drives, phone charger and SD cards. It's a pain the arse, especially the loss of the SD card slot. Price is a problem, too. With the new entry-level Macbook Pro (without the new Touch Bar) starting from £1,449. Many fans of the Pro and the MacBook Air, including myself, are now looking to cheaper PC alternatives following Apple's recent launch. For me, the new MacBook Pro is a great advert for the old one, which makes it a disappointment in my eyes. Tom says... The new Macbook Pros are ridiculously expensive, but it's the price you pay for what is arguably the best laptop on the market. I love my current Macbook Pro – it's fast, reliable and very portable, three areas the new Macbook Pro improves on even further. The more powerful Skylake processor (and dedicated Radeon graphics card in the 15-inch model), bigger touchpad, innovative new Touch Bar and future proof USB C ports are solid upgrades. Combined with a redesigned thinner and lighter chassis, the new Macbook Pro 2016 is the ultimate laptop. What do you think?

Rann Xeroxx November 2, 2016, 11:35 pm "The new Macbook Pros are ridiculously expensive, but it's the price you pay for what is arguably the best laptop on the market." ROTFLMAO.... really? Maybe a few years ago. Now with the Surface Book, HP Specter 360, hell even the Razor Blade Pro in the market Apple, has not been the best laptop in a long, long while. johnnyJive November 2, 2016, 11:51 pm Its more than a disppointment. We are weighing our options in the studio, considering that 28" Surface costs around the same as new Macbook Pro. Full touch, rather than little emoji touchbar seems the way to go. iPilya November 3, 2016, 8:49 am if that is what you are comparing... you are really off it. Comparing a desktop computer versus a portal computer for the studio does not need (nor should it need) to be manufacture or model specific. Only after you decide on your need for mobility should you start to look at manufactures and their models. Parm November 3, 2016, 9:04 am They have priced a large number of people out of buying one, me being one of them. Your best options now would be to buy a refurb, pre-owned or move to windows. many of their products have gone in this direction. Whilst many of their products are still superior to their competitors, the gap is not as large as it used to be. Windows 10 with an SSD is good and stable in some ways. You could buy a half decent Windows machine, get 2-3 years life out of it and then change it to another decent machine and your total expenditure(on the 2 laptops) will STILL be less than buying a macbook pro. iPilya November 3, 2016, 9:46 am I am seriously beside myself by what the "professionals" are complaining about (not to mention the non-professional peanut gallery). I am providing my unwarranted thoughts in the hope that maybe it can give a few people a new way to look at the situation. There have been two fundamental issues throughout the computer age in regards to manufactures and change. I remember when I was working for Microsoft, we tried so very very hard to get manufactures to drop the legacy ports of that era. Dell in particular had made a couple of prototypes that did just this. With what was made we were able to get boot-time to go from in minutes to in the teens of seconds. This was dramatic and not the only way this improved the user experience. However, Dell got cold feet and dropped out of the effort as well as Sony and a few others. Basically the effort collapsed and status quo rules to this day. The second aspect is that we have now built a computer echo system that uses so many connector types that its unwise if not truly impossible to include them all on a notebook computer. And its not just the computer itself that its he problem. We still see the need for VGA on projectors as an example. Gamers have a strong belief in PS2 keyboard connections to decrease latency. We have HDMI and DP for more modern display connections. The RJ-45 for wired LAN and the audio jack from headphones. For some there is eSata for your external drives and the SD card slot. Finally the USB Type A, Thunderbolt2 and now the combined Type-C / Thunderbolt 3 connector. In short it is a mess! As a professional, I buy mobile devices like notebook computers so I can be mobile. Lugging a computer around and through airports has always been exhaustive. I nearly broke my back during the days of my Dell Inspiron laptop. Which brings me to the point of my reasoning for my glee for having only the 4 Thunderbolt 3/Type-C ports on my notebook. I can now use a single cable to “dock” my computer where I can work with two 5k displays and all my attached devices because they include all the ports I need or want. When I head out to clients, I simply unplug that single connector. While I do not have a need to connect my notebook up at the clients office, if I did… because of the universal nature of Thunderbolt 3 / Type-C, I can do what no computer without a Type-C can do. I can use a (add explicit) dongle to connect to any port I wanted. I would like to expand a little as well in regards to having to “update” my peripherals. As a “professional” I use a yearly cycle to rotate through them. I keep the older peripherals around as “backup” incase the current fail. I rely on my hardware (and software) to make money. When something new comes around that can dramatically impact the time spent doing a task, then more then likely it will have a positive impact on my revenue. Thus I would be a fool not to jump in. So trust me, if I am getting 2600MB/s instead of 245MB/s then you better believe I am ecstatic! So basically what I am saying is this… the changes to the ports on the new MacBook Pros is for Professionals and not for the home enthusiasts that has not true necessity for moving forward as quickly as a professional. Apple is STILL selling the previous model of MacBook Pros that can satisfy legacy needs. If these do not meet your needs, then go with another platform. But do not complain because a company is brave (and smart) enough to move forward to address the needs of its professionals. As a final to my conclusion… yes I am upset with Apple for not doing more in the area I wanted to see change… and for not announcing new Mac Pros or iMacs… for not building their own displays… and for otherwise letting their computer echo system of peripherals decay. But the ports… for my needs its spot on! LeeTronix November 3, 2016, 12:23 pm Never thought I would ever agree with Andy on anything but I do here. It is just awful, gimmicky and a stayed same old design. Ive even said that they would put design before sales - says it all except what design. Apple is obsessed with thinner lighter thinner again and removing the usual ports so they can have a nice clean design is well stupid and shows how they couldn't care about their customers. I have had mac's since from 1982 and this has just been the final nail in the coffin. I do not know what planet they are on more like plain of different existence because they do not speak the language of earth anymore. The price is beyond insane, they do not have a strong business market and now they have just priced themselves out of their core customer base and creative media professionals... As for the UK ripoff prices well they have shown their ugly monstrous greedy teeth...Their is no justification for the costs and the stupid choice of poor fairy dated hardware say for the processors. And yes I do know about business before I get some couch expert telling me this and that when they have no real life experience such corporate matters. The touch thing is good for small slim fingered emoji fans who love all those types of things and that is fine, its fun sure but not practical for real work despite what they showed. Touch typists are going to massively struggle. Focus on a bar takes away more focus of the screen, and this tech is not new its been around for yrs. As for the dongle problems backwards step is a compliment - it is dire. If they wanted to try to influence change at least they could of left a normal USB port and the MagSafe which is certainly dumber. The track pad makes the whole laptop look UGLY. Still do not see the so called design genius. I have the Mac Pro (2013 edition/black one) now that is innovative and clever etc. I have the iMac and iPad and iPhone all latest versions and I am now writing this in my 2011 17" MBPro which I love and prefer it to any of the new to latest offerings. In fact on that subject why the hell they did stop the 17" is beyond me, yes it might not of sold as many but when it was dropped most mac fans were shocked and now they are sought after. Anyways - Apple have messed up and they seem to have turned their backs on the iMac and Mac Pro's for the foreseeable future. Cant use the iPhone without a bunch of cables, can't use cameras without a bunch of cables, need cable dongles with cable end converters. Oh and its more money for more mess - seriously Apple? that is a design genius! NOT.... Oooh it turns on though. And last but not least no start up chime. At least MSFT are doing something and working hard to fix or iron out the issues with windows 10. They have really started to try to innovate and bring their hardware products up to a hight standard. I think Apple should look at something like the Google Chrome Pixel note book, the design and build quality of that is exceptional and probably my favourite design and high end quality note book I have ever seen. Just a thought. Design 1 / 10 Touch bar 2 / 10 Track Pad 2 / 10 Cost 0 / 10 Thunderbolt only 0 / 10 Innovative 0 / 10 Result = Ditch Apple Products go back to Windows. LeeTronix November 3, 2016, 12:29 pm I appreciate what you wrote and liked some of your thoughts but I have to disagree on the part about its designed for professionals. Professionals want a mature progression so it does not impact how we operate instantly and use the MBK's. This is a kill switch from Apple without due consideration for its customers or indeed future professional customers. They should of still included a USB port and MagSafe but they did not because they put clean lines and less to replace thinner and lighter solutions not mention a stayed boring design meaning it has not moved on. Basically it is a mess and it is a huge step backwards 15 - 20 yrs now in terms of peripheral support. Ive got it so badly wrong and should stop focusing on his own obsessions...Just a thought. mode11 November 3, 2016, 2:10 pm USB-C/TB3 is a truly universal, forward-looking connector; every laptop should have one. It allows a single connection to a dock / monitor with power, HDMI, Ethernet, USB-A etc., so you don't need to detach a pile of cables to be mobile. When you are mobile, though, it would be nice to plug in a USB memory stick, HDMI projector or SD card without needing to use dongles. So it should have those ports *as well*. Sure, the future will doubtless be all-USB-C, but in 5 years this laptop will be obsolete anyway. Whilst I generally applaud Apple's aesthetics, they often sacrifice practicality for style - e.g. rear-mounted iMac USB ports, the rear-mounted Mac mini SD slot, all their mice ever, the easily-scratched aluminium etc. Here, it feels like they've gone all-USB-C just for symmetry. I also think they've got a bit addicted to removing ports. They called it right a few times, but now they're just looking for excuses to do it, as if doing so automatically equals innovation / daring / "courage". It's almost done as a kind of controversial statement, to get attention. Octavian November 3, 2016, 7:58 pm Professional laptops from Dell and Lenovo last far longer than 2-3 years. Lenovo in particular is known for building bullet-proof machines. I'm fully invested in Dell through my company, and my new personal laptop was a Dell because of the great experience I've had with the work laptops over the years. It also cost $1000 less what a comparably equipped MacBook Pro would cost. Octavian November 3, 2016, 8:00 pm They're comparing them because the Microsoft workstation offers far more capability than the MBPs for about the same price. The need to be mobile is probably not relevant in this case. Parm November 3, 2016, 11:02 pm lol. I mentioned 2-3 years as a generalisation, had i said longer I am sure someone would have replied stating that their windows machine never lasted that long. What I will say is that with windows it isnt always just about the spec. Generally speaking, let me emphasize "generally" windows machines date a lot quicker and at the very least need regular re-installs. Over time the machine slows down, sleep state state eventually turns to comatose state, instability sets in. Windows is better with win10 but they have some huge UX issues that just should not be there. I had a Dell inspiron i7, I have to say it was the worst laptop I had ever bought. Will never buy the budget ranges of any brand. Octavian November 4, 2016, 3:19 am YMMV but the laptop I turned in a month ago was leased back in 2011 and I never had to re-install Windows. It was a Latitude i7 and was running Win 7 Pro. It was used every day, rebooted very rarely (1-2 times/month), and generally abused. Besides the battery, everything worked perfectly. My current work laptop is another Latitude i7 (Skylake) with 16GB RAM. My current personal laptop is a XPS 15 (non-touch). I will wager that I won't have to re-install Windows, unless I get a better ssd to replace the factory unit.

 Here's why Apple kept the headphone jack in the new MacBook, but not the new iPhone Dave Smith Nov. 2, 2016, 1:04 PM 25,300 facebook linkedin twitter email print In September, Apple's marketing boss Phil Schiller explained why the iPhone 7 wouldn't have a headphone jack. Reuters/Beck Diefenbach Lots of people were furious when Apple killed off the headphone jack in its latest iPhone, the iPhone 7. Many were happy about its replacement (a Lightning-enabled pair of EarPods) or its workaround (a dongle to connect your old headphones). Thankfully, Apple's newest MacBook Pro laptops, which were unveiled last week, retain the old 3.5 mm headphone jack. Of course, that begs the question: Why did Apple kill the headphone jack in the iPhone, but not the MacBook Pro? Phil Schiller, Apple's marketing boss, was asked this question by The Independent this week. Here was his explanation: "These are pro machines. If it was just about headphones then it doesn’t need to be there; we believe that wireless is a great solution for headphones. But many users have setups with studio monitors, amps, and other pro audio gear that do not have wireless solutions and need the 3.5mm jack." It's a strange answer from Schiller, considering the fact that Apple's newest MacBook Pros also lack an SD card slot, which is a nuisance for many pro photographers that still use SD cards for transferring tons of data from their high-end cameras. You'd think Schiller's logic above would justify Apple keeping the SD card slot in the MacBook Pro — since so many pro photographers and users need it for their setups — and yet that doesn't seem to be the case.  Schiller's reasoning for keeping the headphone jack in the MacBook Pro is also a far cry from his one-word reasoning for killing the jack in the iPhone 7: "courage." Here was Schiller's full explanation for killing the headphone jack, back in September: "Now, some people have asked why we would remove the analog headphone jack from the iPhone. The reason to move on really comes down to one word: courage. The courage to move on and do something new that betters all of us. Maintaining an ancient, single-purpose, analog connector doesn't make sense because that space is at a premium. It makes no sense to tether ourselves with cables to our mobile devices. But until someone takes on these challenges, that's what we do." Apple could have applied this same reasoning to ditching the headphone jack in the MacBooks — maybe it could've used a USB-C port or a Lightning port instead, but it didn't. MacBooks are technically mobile devices, and yet, Schiller says it would've been a nuisance for customers. As if killing the headphone jack in the iPhone isn't a nuisance for customers (as an iPhone 7 owner, I can tell you it is, but I accept it anyway.) And so, whether you like it or not, that's Apple's reasoning for keeping the headphone jack in one product, but not another. Apple could have released a new MacBook Pro without a headphone jack, but that would've taken, y'know, courage. EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

The new models also have a fingerprint sensor built into the power button, to buy stuff online faster than you can say “impulse purchase”. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments In this interview, Philip Schiller, Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, told The Independent all about them. Schiller is a familiar face at Apple keynotes, mixing a dry sense of humour with bullish, on-message statements. Some are controversial: he recently told an audience of 6,000 that Apple was removing the headphone jack from the iPhone 7, for instance. In person, he has an understated charm and a forensic intelligence. If some of my questions seem abrupt, it’s because Schiller understood what I was getting at before I had quite said them. Don’t be fooled by Schiller’s job title. He is across every product the company makes, and passionate, of course, about every one of them. We first talked in an Apple-white private room at Infinite Loop, the company’s Californian headquarters, minutes after the new laptops had been unveiled and followed up a few days later... The keynote video showed Apple laptops from the last 25 years. Seeing it, you can’t predict where the design will go, but each new one it seems like a logical continuation. Yes, and what’s remarkable is as things become smaller the range of big, obvious differences reduce. When you see the history of those notebooks, the first one is 2 ¼ inches thick. There’s a lot of room to make part lines and seams on them and things that create character but as you get to something where it’s so defined by its display and its keyboard, as an iPhone is so defined by that display, the design of how it works becomes much more into incredible, nano-sized details. I can’t even imagine the level of tolerances and small details the team will be working on in a few years from now. The new MacBook Pro is pretty light. It is. Big difference. And more rigid. And dense, too. It’s obviously harder to design something that’s stiffer when it’s so much thinner and the tolerances of the design are so much tighter than ever before on our products. To have this flatness and linearity between the huge trackpad surface and the palm rest, it took a level of engineering not possible before. So some things are transparent to the user, they just think it’s a beautiful product but the level of engineering it takes to make this the way it is, is a tremendous technical challenge compared to the past. The evolution of the Touch Bar – how did it come about? It’s part of our thinking about where to take the notebook next. Others are trying to turn the notebook into the tablet. The new MacBook Pro is a product that celebrates that it is a notebook, this shape that has been with us for the last 25 years is probably going to be with us for another 25 years because there’s something eternal about the basic notebook form factor. You have a surface that you type down on with your hands, with a screen facing you vertically. That basic orientation, that L shape makes perfect sense and won’t go away. The team came up with this idea that you can create a multi-touch surface that’s coplanar with the keyboard and the trackpad but brings a whole new experience into it, one that’s more interactive, with multi-touch. Will macOS and iOS (the operating systems for Macs and iPhones) always be different? We’re steadfast in our belief that there are fundamentally two different products to make for customers and they’re both important. There’s iPhone and iPad which are single pieces of glass, they’re direct-manipulation, multi-touch and tend towards full-screen applications. And that’s that experience. And we want to make those the best in that direction anyone can imagine. We have a long road ahead of us on that. Then there’s the Mac experience, dominated by our notebooks and that’s about indirect manipulation and cursors and menus. We want to make this the best experience we can dream of in this direction. Here’s one example of how they should remain distinct: the Mac from the very first has had a menu bar fixed at the top. It’s core to the identity and the experience you get. But iOS doesn’t have a menu at the top. It never will. The thought of pointing at a menu at the top of an iPhone feels wrong. If you made the Mac a touchscreen you’d have to figure out how to make it a good experience with your finger on a touchscreen. Trust me, we’ve looked at that — it’s a bad experience. It’s not as good or as intuitive as with a mouse and trackpad. The new Pros have no SD card slot for a camera memory card. Why not? Because of a couple of things. One, it’s a bit of a cumbersome slot. You've got this thing sticking halfway out. Then there are very fine and fast USB card readers, and then you can use CompactFlash as well as SD. So we could never really resolve this – we picked SD because more consumer cameras have SD but you can only pick one. So, that was a bit of a trade-off. And then more and more cameras are starting to build wireless transfer into the camera. That’s proving very useful. So we think there’s a path forward where you can use a physical adaptor if you want, or do wireless transfer. Is it inconsistent to keep the 3.5mm headphone jack as it’s no longer on the latest iPhone? Not at all. These are pro machines. If it was just about headphones then it doesn’t need to be there, we believe that wireless is a great solution for headphones. But many users have setups with studio monitors, amps, and other pro audio gear that do not have wireless solutions and need the 3.5mm jack. Tell me about Siri on the Mac. We waited quite a while to bring Siri to the Mac because we didn’t want to bring it until it could do some things Mac users would really require, like file searching and things like that. We could have brought it earlier without that but it wouldn’t have made as much sense to us. But there’s no “Hey Siri”, where you can invoke the voice assistant by just speaking to it, on the Mac? That has more to do with system electronics and low power capabilities. You would want to be able to say “Hey Siri” from across the room even when your Mac is asleep, so if you still have to go across the room to wake the Mac, then what’s the point? You need to build system-wide electronics that are in the right standby state, listening for that catchphrase and that’s not built into the electronics of Mac today. Yesterday, I caught up with Mr Schiller again, to assess public reactions to the new products How would you describe the response to the new MacBook Pro? There has certainly been a lot of passionate dialogue and debate about the new MacBook Pro! Many things have impressed people about it, and some have caused some controversy. I hope everyone gets a chance to try it for themselves and see how great the MacBook Pro is. It is a really big step forward and an example of how much we continue to invest in the Mac. We love the Mac and are as committed to it, in both desktops and notebooks, as we ever have been. And we are proud to tell you that so far our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before. So there certainly are a lot of people as excited as we are about it. Are you surprised by how vocal the critics have been? To be fair it has been a bit of a surprise to me. But then, it shouldn’t be. I have never seen a great new Apple product that didn’t have its share of early criticism and debate — and that’s cool. We took a bold risk, and of course with every step forward there is also some change to deal with. Our customers are so passionate, which is amazing. We care about what they love and what they are worried about. And it's our job to help people through these changes. We know we made good decisions about what to build into the new MacBook Pro and that the result is the best notebook ever made, but it might not be right for everyone on day one. That’s okay, some people felt that way about the first iMac and that turned out pretty good.

The Vigilante app then sends alerts to the smartphones of people near where the crimes have been reported, but Apple says it  could encourage risk or physical harm by people misusing/misreporting crimes or taking crime-solving duties into their own hands. The app’s creators released a statement on their website saying the app was no longer available. “We are working with Apple to resolve their concerns,” the company said in a statement. “Vigilante will introduce an Android version of the app in the upcoming weeks with plans to expand in additional cities later this year.” Related Stories What Is Microsoft Teams? Slack Competitor Announced Wednesday Hulu Live TV Service Will Have Disney, ABC, ESPN, Fox And More Announcing the Vigilante app in a Medium blog post, the company wrote: ""What if everyone within a quarter mile of every reported crime were immediately made aware of it. What if there were a camera on every crime. What if transparency existed — if we all knew where crime was occurring and how it was being resolved. Would crime as we know it still exist?" The company added: “The lens of the camera is incapable of lying. When we are able to look at a situation from multiple angles, the truth emerges. Transparency is the single most powerful tool in the fight against crime and injustice, and we believe it will rebuild cooperation towards a shared vision. Cooperation, in turn, will lead to safer communities, better cities, and a stronger nation." "Unfortunately, Vigilante is not currently available on the App Store," the note said. "We are working with Apple to resolve their concerns. In the meantime, the Vigilante app will continue to operate for those who already have it. On the map, users can see reports of crimes. Though the creators of the app have stressed the app is meant to help people avoid crimes, there’s a risk that users will try to investigate crimes themselves.

Photo by Pat Greenhouse/The Boston Globe via Getty Images “I don’t know about you, but I spent  election night with my family,” wrote Ben Brantley in The New York Times two days after Barack Obama was re-elected president.   “The Apples are not, for the record, my blood kin,” he went on to clarify. “But after spending both Tuesday night and the 10th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks with them, I have come to feel as closely related to them as if we had grown up under the same roof. They annoy, tickle and inspire me; and they make me feel wanted and generous and unkind and guilty—and about as comfortable and uncomfortable at the same time as anybody can. As I said, they’re family.” This week it’s another opening, another show, another election and even another family for Brantley to address. Richard Nelson plopped the Apple clan down on key historical dates for a four-play cycle, commissioned by The Public and premiered there on the very day they’re set; now, he’s moved two blocks down the street to the Gabriels, another fictional Rhinebeck family that also wears the politics of the times. Part III in the Gabriel trilogy, Women of a Certain Age, bows at The Public on election night, but previews begin four days before it’s set, provoking a very pressing question. “’Who won?’” guesses Nelson. Bingo! Once raised, though, the question is quickly waved away. “It’s not who I think will win or what I want,” he insists. “It’s trying to look at this election constantly through their eyes. I’ll have a note in the program, saying, ‘The name of this cycle is The Gabriels: Election Year in the Life of One Family.’ Given the kind of election that we’re having, it’s very easy to ignore the fourth word of that—‘year’—and to think of it as the election in the life of one family. That’s not what the plays have been about. They’ve tracked a year in the life of this one family, and it also happens to be an election year. It’s how the election drags its way in and out of this family’s lives. It’s getting a sense of what’s happening in the election on a particular day and how that relates, or doesn’t relate, to the concerns of this family.” Be it Apple or Gabriel, these seven plays are kitchen set. “All the plays have the same basic structure: A meal is being prepared, and when the meal is done being cooked—not eaten, cooked—the play is over. ‘Take the food off to the dining room.’” Why the kitchen? Easy. “Before I began the plays,” he says, “I read an extraordinary thing that stuck with me. Someone said something that now appears to be obvious, but it was something I’d never heard articulated before: ‘Human beings are the only animals that cook; therefore, cooking is one of the things that makes us human.’ “So, in a play that has as its ambition the complexity and richness of humans, it’s the perfect setting. The opportunity to have a play with these ambitions, with everyone doing an activity that defines us as human, seemed a very good, very useful idea.” The cast of Richard Nelson’s Hungry, performed at the Public Theatre. Photo by Joan Marcus All seven plays have the same parentheses, too. They begin with Maryann Plunkett entering with food, and they end with Maryann Plunkett leaving with food. And also, prominently on the premises in all seven is Plunkett’s real husband, Jay O. Sanders. In the Apple plays, they are siblings; in the Gabriel plays, they are in-laws. Somehow, the couple never played marrieds. The closest they’ve come is a Macbeth workshop, and they count that because they intend to do it some day. “We’ve a different take on it that makes full use of our being on the older side of our careers,” injects Sanders. Nelson claims he didn’t write these roles for them. “I organized the plays in my head, and I saw there would be two really good roles for them. Perhaps, as I continued to write the plays, I had them in mind, certainly, but it wasn’t ‘I’m going to write two plays for Maryann and Jay.’ It’s just I knew they’d be great for what I had in mind. “The three of us have worked together now as a team for five or six years. Jay’s been a friend of mine for almost 40 years, and Maryann has been in other plays of mine in the past 15 years. They understand my work. We understand each other. They’re wonderful to have in a rehearsal room. They are very special people, very talented.” In the Sanders home hang two Al Hirschfeld originals—one of him as The Incredibly Famous Willy Rivers, the hell-raising rocker of Stephen Metcalfe’s 1984 play, and one of her as the girl of 1986’s Me and My Girl, a sweet Cockney songbird named Sally Smith (her Tony-winning role). That’s how they entered our theater consciousness. They entered each other’s consciousness on camera, filming an episode of A Man Named Hawk, a Spenser: For Hire spinoff that only made a few revolutions, but they were in one of them, playing exes on the brink of reconciliation. “Our first kiss was on film,” Sanders remembers. “Then, we sorta danced around having a relationship for about a year because both of us had been in long relationships before and…” October 1 marked their silver wedding anniversary. In the interim, they produced an actor son, Jamie, who graduated from Emerson in May and now studies at Michael Howard’s Studios for the one-year conservatory program. “He’s very good, and we’re very proud of him,” says Plunkett, more like a discerning critic than a mom. The actor’s life for them has meant two successful careers consistently charging away but separately. Exception: A. R. Gurney’s beautiful play, The Old Boy, allowed them to spend a summer at his alma mater, SUNY Purchase, again playing exes. “It was funny because it was about a guy going back to his own boys’ school to give the commencement address,” says Sanders. “He was a politician, but in this case, it was the first time I had gone back to that school, so there were some connections there.” In 2010, Nelson waved the quartet of Apple plays at them, and they had the luxury of co-starring for four years. When the Gabriel plays came up this year—an express train of three plays in one year—they hopped aboard like a conditioned reflex. In both cycles, they were in excellent company. Laila Robins, J. Smith-Cameron, Shuler Hensley and Jon De Vries numbered among the Apples; now, gathering around the Gabriel table are the newly widowed Plunkett, her husband’s sister (Amy Warren), brother (Sanders) and sister-in-law (Lynn Hawley), the clan’s matriarch (Roberta Maxwell) and, bizarrely, the deceased’s first wife (Meg Gibson). Sanders and Plunkett entered both of these family circles with the extra edge of decades of togetherness. “Because we do like each other and because we do have intimacy with each other and live together like these families, we have that already built in,” the actress concedes. “We don’t have to create that. It’s there already.” Nevertheless, they kept that carefully in check, according to Sanders. “I think the biggest thing is the dynamic of the casts that we’re in—being equally connected to  everybody else on stage, so we don’t in any way alienate them or make them feel that we’re a unit separate from them. We don’t spend an inordinate amount of time just talking to each other on stage. In any family relationships, everybody’s talking. “Our familiarity with each other, of course, was helpful. We’ve often been asked if it’s strange playing brother and sister or brother- and sister-in-law, and we say, ‘The strange thing would be if we were brother and sister playing a married couple—that would be strange.’ You could play it, but letting yourself go there would be difficult.” Performances by all hands are bone-dry real and natural—a quality Plunkett credits to Nelson’s “exactly life-sized” writing and directing. “I think of it as just a complete surrender,” she says. “You can’t be thinking of showing anything. You have to enter the room and be in the room. If you’re thinking of other things, it won’t work.” Of course, in this case, the meal doesn’t cook itself, so you have to think of other things. “In rehearsing the play we’re doing now,” she continues, “we staged the whole thing the first week. Now, we’re going through scene by scene, trying to mix the real food in. As with anything, you find when you make believe, you can do so many things, but when you actually do them in real time, you’re suddenly going, ‘Omigod! I got a pot of hot potatoes here. I have to drain ‘em. Do I have a line now?’ ” Nelson watches the kettle and cast intensely, stamping out any false moves or moments. “There’s a line he says when he’s directing,” Plunkett recalls. “He says, ‘I don’t really know how to do this, but I know if it’s not right. It can’t look like a play. How do we make it not look like a play?’ When it feels right to him, it’s right. It’s all about just being there, being present and real—as real as you can when saying lines.” Although these Nelson family picnics tend to pop up on dates of no small political importance, Nelson himself prefers to play the apolitical card. “I don’t consider myself a political dramatist at all,” the writer-director declares. “I think that I’m a socialist dramatist, but really I just write about people I’m interested in. I’m not interested in convincing anyone of anything. I’m not interested in convincing anybody to vote for anyone. I’m simply interested in showing the complexity of people in a truthful situation, and that often includes politics in our society.”  Up NextTick, Tick…Borle!

Pandora laid out its plans to grow its on-demand service to 11 million listeners by 2020. Adam Levy (adamlevy) Nov 2, 2016 at 12:41PM Image source: Getty Images. The rise of on-demand music streaming services may have taken the life out of Pandora Media (NYSE:P). With its third-quarter earnings results, the company reported just 77.9 million listeners. That's less than the 78.1 million it reported in the third quarter last year, and its third consecutive sequential decline. But Pandora plans to launch its own premium on-demand service, Pandora Premium, by the end of the year to help stanch its user losses. The service will compete directly against Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Music, Spotify, and Tidal. Management laid out its expectations for the service at its analyst day on Oct. 25. 11.3 million subscribers by 2020 Pandora expects to grow Pandora Premium to 11.3 million subscribers by 2020. That's relatively modest, considering Apple Music had 17 million subscribers after 15 months and Spotify has 40 million subscribers worldwide. But even that number may be difficult for Pandora to reach given its track record of converting its listeners into paid subscribers. Pandora has offered a subscription tier for its internet radio service since 2009, but it's converted only about 5% of its listeners to subscribers. At the investor day, CEO Tim Westergren said that "Pandora Premium is essentially the full interactive on-demand service. Again, it will be -- radio will be at its core. The notion of listening, continuous listening will be at the center of this product. It will have all the features of Plus, so the rewinding, skipping, offline, et cetera, but it will now include the ability to search and play, the ability to build and share playlists, taking everything offline and many, many more Pandora-esque features that we can't reveal now for competitive purposes that I think will bring a unique flavor to how this product surfaces for the consumer. We're going to reinvent the interactive experience just the same way we invented online personalized radio." 75% already listen to on-demand At Pandora's analyst day presentation, product chief Chris Phillips gave some details about the demand for on-demand streaming within Pandora's listener base. Most notably, 58 million of Pandora's 78 million listeners already use an on-demand streaming service and 20 million of those are paid subscribers. While Phillips holds this up as an opportunity for Pandora, it's more like an opportunity lost. These are customers who have spent hundreds of hours using another product. They've made their own playlists, developed a profile, and taken advantage of the unique features of Spotify or Apple Music. That completely negates the advantages Pandora is leaning on, such as its listener data. There are significant switching costs for listeners -- even free listeners -- that Pandora is ignoring. And it's relying, at least to some degree, on having customers switch from Spotify and Apple Music to Pandora Premium. That leaves just 20 million Pandora listeners as the company's biggest opportunity to attract new subscribers. Yet those are customers who have yet to express much interest in other on-demand services, which means they'll probably be difficult to convert. And given Pandora's history of converting listeners into subscribers, that doesn't bode well. Content costs going up Pandora is facing a tough environment, and its subscription services will be key to navigating through it. The company has seen its content costs increase this year after agreeing to pay for licenses for songs recorded before 1972. Those content costs will rise even higher going forward after striking deals with the record labels for on-demand streaming. Pandora paid $93.3 million in additional prepaid content acquisition costs in relation to the deals it made with record labels for on-demand streaming last quarter. Note, however, that those are minimum guaranteed payments that Pandora will be able to recoup if it streams enough songs. Still, the standard revenue share for Pandora Premium (70%) will be higher than it's used to in years past. In 2014, Pandora paid out 48% of its total streaming revenue to record labels. That number climbed to 53% last year. Through the first three quarters of 2016, content costs are up to 56% after paying back some one-time costs associated with pre-1972 licensing. That number is poised to climb even higher following its recent deals with record labels. Pandora's management is making a big bet on on-demand streaming. And while it does have some advantages going for it, the vast majority of its user base already uses another service. Just because they still listen to Pandora radio doesn't mean they'll subscribe to Pandora Premium. In that light, even Pandora's modest 11 million user estimate seems aggressive.

Without the key features that prior versions of the MacBook Pros had, the new Apple product is "unsatisfyingly not pro," as this parody ad from YouTube tech channel Iggyhopper puts it. "Need a MacBook Pro?" the video teases. "Like pro pro? Like needs an adaptor for everything pro?" That's right, because the new MacBook Pro has four USB Type-C ports, which means you'll need to buy an adapter to plug in your iPhone or anything else that requires a regular old USB, called the USB 2.0, port. "Adapt seamlessly between all your Apple adapters," the ad mocks. It’s clear the video is playing straight to our emotions. "The saddest part is that no matter how overpriced and underpowered these things are, people will keep buying them and all the stupid adapters, dongles, and other nonsense designed to scam money out of people just because it's from Apple," one person commented on the parody. "It's a brilliant idea, if you think about it. Remove something everybody uses, charge extra for some sort of adapter and call it 'innovation.'" Read More: The New MacBook Pros Mark the End of Upgradeable Apple Computers So what else does the new MacBook Pro lack? Among other things the parody quips about: the charger isn't magnetic, it has no HDMI or DisplayPort for VR, no SD card for photos and videos, a "low quality" 720p (1280x720 pixels) front-facing camera, and a maximum memory of only 16 gigabits. "I give up," the new MacBook Pro says robotically. Now the question is, will all Apple's loyal, disappointed customers give up, too?

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Apple Reportedly ‘Not Interested’ In Time Warner Acquisition By Adnan Farooqui on 11/02/2016 09:38 PST It has been rumored for the past couple of years that Apple is interested in acquiring Time Warner. The company hasn’t ever made a formal bid and it’s chances of making one now seem quite slim given that AT&T has agreed to acquire Time Warner for $84.5 billion. Recent reports suggested that a major investment bank was pushing Apple to consider making a bid but the latest from the street is that Apple is “not interested” in acquiring Time Warner. Just because AT&T has announced that it has agreed to acquire Time Warner for $85.4 billion doesn’t mean the deal is done. It will take months for regulatory approvals to go through and until the ink is dry, any other company can make a competing bid and Time Warner being a publicly listed company has an obligation to its shareholders to consider competing bids. According to the latest report, Apple is now interested in acquiring Time Warner at this point in time. The possibility isn’t being ruled out entirely, but Apple is said to be not interested in making a competing bid right now. It may take up to a year for this deal between AT&T and Time Warner to go through so Apple has plenty of time on its hands to reconsider and make a bid. Whether or not it will do so is an entirely different matter. Apple recently hinted that it’s open to making strategic acquisitions of any size and it certainly has the cash on its hands to better the $85.4 billion that AT&T is offering. Filed in General.

One that's 12 percent lighter, 13 percent smaller by volume and practically the same weight -- but manages to cram in a faster Intel processor, faster graphics, plus the far sharper, brighter and more colorful Retina Display the MacBook Air so desperately needed. Sure, it starts at $1,500 rather than $1,000, but you get twice the solid-state storage for the price -- and you can double the RAM, quadruple the storage and get the awesome new Touch Bar secondary screen with Touch ID fingerprint sensor if you're willing to pay even more. How long has your MacBook Air had a 1.6GHz processor? This new one is 2.0GHz or 2.9GHz; there's even a 3.3GHz option. And sure, it's got a thinner keyboard and only two (or four) general-purpose Thunderbolt 3 ports instead of handy full-size USB ports and SD card slots. But we, Apple, figured you'd rather have a more accurate keyboard and amazing single-cable Thunderbolt 3 docking options to go with your mobile MacBook Air lifestyle. Now, you can pull your MacBook Air right out of your manila envelope and plug in a single cable to charge it, dock with your peripherals and power multiple monitors all at the same time. Oh, and one more thing: we knew you'd like the MacBook Air so much, we built a 15-inch model. You won't believe how fast it is -- this Air has a quad-core CPU that's 50 percent faster than last year's MacBook Pro! The graphics are over twice as fast, and yet we've kept the same 10 hour battery life as the 13-inch version. If you've ever wanted to edit photos or home videos on a MacBook Air, this computer's for you. Oh, and it comes standard with the Touch Bar and Touch ID, too. We think you're going to love the new MacBook Air. It's the best MacBook we've ever made. Everything I just said is true of Apple's new laptops. But all of it describes the new MacBook Pro, not the MacBook Air. Apple chose to market a thinner Pro instead of a faster Air, even though they're basically the same thing. And that's not lost on Apple -- it was Apple marketing VP Phil Schiller who suggested the 13-inch MacBook Pro (the one without the Touch Bar) was designed for MacBook Air buyers. (That's him in the pictures above.) "We think that a lot of potential MacBook Air customers are going to be very excited by this product, too," said Schiller. But the choice between a thinner Pro and a faster Air isn't just semantics -- the word "Pro" carries weight. The new MacBook Pro is not for pros, and pros know it. That one word could cost Apple an awful lot of customers.

Home News Audio, Sound & Speakers AirPods might not see the light of day until January Apple's AirPods, wireless ear buds with 5 hours of battery life, were announced in September and their price is set at $159 By: Lana Jelic | Audio, Sound & Speakers News | Posted: 1 week, 5 days ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Apple's AirPods, which were scheduled to go on sale late October (that ship has sailed), were first postponed because according to Apple's spokesperson "they need a little more time before the AirPods are ready for customers."     Although a new date hasn't been given, users expected the delay wouldn't be a longer than a month, or at least the wireless ear buds that are somewhat of a replacement for the lack of headphone jack on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus would be ready before Christmas.   However, according to MacRumors, that might not happen. They report is that Apple is aiming towards January 2017 for the AirPods launch.   Apple's AirPods, wireless ear buds with 5 hours of battery life, were announced in September and their price is set at $159.

November 2 AAPL: 111.59 0.10 MacBook Pro Touch Bar support for Logic Pro X coming early next year Jordan Kahn - 2 weeks ago @JordanKahn MacBook Pro Logic View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple impressed me with the apps it had ready for the new MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar at launch. It’s not just limited to button replacements or system functions, which you can customize, but will also support Final Cut Pro, Terminal, GarageBand, Maps, iTunes, Calendar, Djay Pro, Photoshop, and lot of other Apple and third-party apps when customers start receiving the first orders in the weeks to come. But as a daily Logic Pro X user, I noted the lack of mention for Apple’s pro audio suite at the unveiling of its new Pro notebook. The good news: we’ve learned from a source familiar with the company’s plans that the Logic Pro team is currently targeting early next year for Touch Bar support. As for what we can expect from the update, since Logic Pro X shares many features with Apple’s entry-level audio suite, GarageBand, the company’s demo of Touch Bar support for that app gives us a few clues. On stage, Apple briefly showed GarageBand support with the company’s Phil Schiller noting that “it’s great for controlling musical instruments you play in GarageBand.” Let’s take a closer look here: GarageBand is using Touch Bar for the app’s Smart Controls feature to provide quick access to effects and plug-ins. Above we can see “Level, Gain, Tremolo, Tone, Fuzz, Drive, StudioA/Room, Delay,” which are similar to Smart Controls or plug-ins one might have enabled for a guitar patch or similar. Smart Controls are customizable, so here’s to hoping there is some level of customization in Logic when Touch Bar support arrives. Plug-ins aren’t exactly playing musical instruments, so Apple likely has some other features planned too. In the already released GarageBand update, Apple notes the ability to “tap the Touch Bar to quickly fine-tune the sound of instruments and effects, or adjust the volume of a track.” The Djay app team also showed off its own custom UI for mixing that could give you an idea of the possibilities there: Logic Pro X last received a big update earlier this summer bringing a ton of new features including Retina redesign for seven more plugins, Flex Pitch improvements, new loops, and a lot more. Apple completely overhauled the $199 app a couple of years back (full review), and it’s since been on a pretty regular schedule with updates that bring 2-3 big feature changes each year. Apple first started accepting orders for the new MacBook Pro models following its event last week, with the models that have Touch Bar expected to ship in 2-3 weeks. Shipping estimates in the US and elsewhere have since increased to 4-5 weeks for the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar as the company today confirmed the device set a new online sales record. Apple also has a new 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar which is currently available and shipping.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple has faced criticism over the last week for removing the SD card slot from its new MacBook Pro 2016 computers. Sure, the company may have gotten away with removing the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, but some photographers and videographers still relied on the SD slot for transferring files to their computers. Now Apple’s Phil Schiller has explained why Apple decided to kill it. “It’s a bit of a cumbersome slot,” Schiller told The Independent in a recent interview. “You’ve got this thing sticking halfway out. Then there are very fine and fast USB card readers, and then you can use CompactFlash as well as SD,” he added. “So we could never really resolve this – we picked SD because more consumers cameras have SD but you can only pick one. So that was a bit of a trade-off. And then more and more cameras are starting to build wireless transfer into the camera. That’s proving very useful. SO we think there’s a path forward where you can use a physical adapter if you want, or do wireless transfer. ” Schiller’s comments underscore the problem consumers have with Apple right now: that the company seems to believe consumers like to pick up extra dongles, card readers and other gadgets that are required to use the company’s products. We don’t, though, and Apple is trying to make those decisions for us. Historically, Apple has done right in choosing what to omit – it got rid of floppy drives, the disc drive and other unnecessary ports while people still thought they were needed. But if we’re carrying dongles to use the cameras we own, some of which might be too old for wireless transfer, then isn’t Apple doing a disservice to its customers? Maybe. In fact, Schiller commented on the response to the MacBook Pro, admitting there has been some bite back from consumers. “Controversy” around MacBook Pro launch “There has certainly been a lot of passionate dialogue and debate about the new MacBook Pro,” he said. “Many things have impressed people about it, and some have caused some controversy. I hope everyone gets a chance to try it for themselves and see how great the MacBook Pro is. It is a really big step forward and an example of how much we continue to invest in the Mac.” While consumers may indeed be critical of the device, it seems many of the journalists who have seen it in person are indeed impressed by its design and capabilities. Perhaps Schiller has a point, maybe we all need to see try it ourselves first.

Not by a long shot. The tech giants just resurrected PCs and Macs, trying to make them fit into the future in a mobile era. In their own events, first Apple and a couple of days later Microsoft, showed off their line-up of hardware and tech for the year. They also showed that the PC-Mac war is not over. Microsoft never did manage to make it in mobile with its Windows Phone only managing to take a little nibble at the market before becoming virtually non-existent. Apple redefined it with the iPhone and its app ecosystem, but is now facing its own challenges as it’s accused of lack of innovation. Getting in touch The big talking point from Apple’s event and the launch of new MacBook Pros was the Touch Bar, a context-aware strip of OLED display that replaces function keys. So much more interesting and a feature that developers can now play with. Though on the 25th anniversary of Apple’s first laptop, one might have thought there would be something more groundbreaking. Be that as it may, the Touch Bar gives you ready access to emojis — and everyone wants those, right? Also shortcuts in PhotoShop, music controls and more importantly Apple’s Touch ID which is the thing that will secure the laptop as well as let users pay for things with their fingerprint. Apple has released a set of strict guidelines on how the Touch Bar is to be used by app developers and its true usefulness – or the lack thereof – will only emerge in time. It’s really like a small second screen that reminds me of Samsung’s Edge bar or LG’s second screen on a phone. Those should have gotten somewhere by now, but sadly didn’t. It’s more prominent than ever now though that Apple doesn’t have a full touch screen on its laptops but then it’s true that it’s an effort to reach out to the screen is not easy and people only use that capability sometimes — in Microsoft’s case it’s most often used to swipe through applications. The new MacBook Pro is thinner and makes the MacBook Air redundant. But Apple has managed to annoy fans by doing away with the memory card slot and Escape key, resulting in much trolling online. Calling all creators Microsoft took a very different approach in its event. There seems to be a general consensus that theirs was the more exciting and promising set of presentations. Having not particularly made it in mobile, Microsoft under Satya Nadella is at the very least making the most of its PC and related businesses, bringing them in line with future trends. Microsoft’s event centred on creative people, both professional and the masses, and made much of a 3D for Everyone tagline. In fact, they tried to take a bite right out of the audience typically considered Apple’s turf. Microsoft has turned the old app, Paint, into a 3D creation tool. One can now draw in 3D or even take photographs and bring them into Windows 10 and Paint to make them into 3D objects that can be turned all around. You can even save your memories in 3D, as a Microsoft executive showed when she took a photo of a sandcastle her daughters made on the beach and used it in an overall 3D creation. In fact, Windows 10’s upgrade, announced at the event, is called the Windows 10 Creators Update. On the Surface Microsoft released new members of its Surface family, but none that made more waves than their first desktop, a large screened beauty called the Surface Studio, a creator’s delight. Thin and sleek, it angles back to just the point anyone would love to have it at to draw, paint, and play with colours. As everyone seems to be saying, it’s something you would have expected Apple to come up with. The Surface Studio will be available in several configurations, all of them pricey and available only in limited quantity. It’s doubtful whether these will make it to India. But along with the Surface Studio, Microsoft also launched an interesting gadget called the Surface Dial which will work with other machines as well. Wired is right when it says that you may not need the Dial but you’ll want it anyway. It’s a round thing that you can twirl, with the digital pencil in the other hand, that shows up a radial rainbow of colours for artists to use a bunch of tools. It moves the position of the canvas, for example when you rotate it. At its event, Microsoft also talked up various realities — augmented, mixed, virtual and the use of its Hololens. There’s little doubt that from becoming a bit of a dinosaur, Microsoft is now a company to watch.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     CNBC: there’s no Time Warner bid coming from Apple “at this point” By Christian Zibreg, Nov 2, 2016 Tweet Leave a Comment U.S. wireless carrier AT&T recently announced it had agreed to buy Time Warner in a blockbuster deal valued at more than $85 billion. Apple reportedly approached the media giant recently about a possible deal, but the discussions were only preliminary and didn’t move forward. With the AT&T-Time Warner merger requiring regulatory approval that could take months, things could easily change so no wonder watchers have been keeping their fingers crossed for Apple to step in and make a rival bid for Time Warner. However, “Apple is not interested in buying Time Warner at present,” people familiar with the thinking at the company told CNBC on Wednesday. “Combining with AT&T is the natural next step in the evolution of our business and allows us to significantly accelerate our most important strategies,” Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said today after his company reported better-than-expected earnings. Anchor David Faber opined on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street:” The question of course that has come back to focus on Apple. In fact Bewkes asked on the call were there any companies this year that showed interest in acquiring Time Warner. Mr. Bewkes’ answer was let’s focus on AT&T. What I can tell you about Apple guys, is right now, according to people familiar with its thinking, it’s not interested. Apple is not interested in buying Time Warner at present. Now, these things go on for months and months, this regulatory review’s going to take at least a year. The deal will not close. Certainly if you’re in Apple, things could change. You watch the stock price as you see how things progress. But anybody expecting an overbid from Apple at this point, certainly, it is not coming. Again, they are sort of not interested at this time. And it doesn’t appear that there would be any other potential interest. Google certainly had been mentioned at one point or another. But right now, it’s AT&T’s, it will be AT&T’s, and the question is do they get it through, what conditions do they agree to in order to get it through the regulators. The New York Post said a few days ago that investment bankers over at Goldman Sachs have been pushing Apple to make a rival bid for Time Warner. “They are freaking out trying to convince Apple to come in,” a source with direct knowledge of the situation said. Goldman Sachs could be trying to persuade Apple to outbid AT&T because it’s been left on the sidelines in advising on AT&T’s $85 billion agreement to acquire Time Warner. It should be also noted that Apple in 2009 hired Goldman Sachs banker Adrian Perica, who now heads up its mergers and acquisitions processes. I certainly hope Apple will not make a rival bid for Time Warner. I cannot begin to comprehend the organizational mess and loosening of focus that would inevitably result from merging the two huge corporations with so diametrically opposite corporate cultures. If I were Apple, I’d just acquire Netflix and be done with it. On the other hand, buying Time Warner would give Apple control over lucrative entertainment properties such as Hollywood studio Warner Bros, franchises like Harry Potter, Batman and Superman and networks like CNN, HBO, TBS, TNT, NBA TV and Cartoon Network. Apple may not be interested in buying Time Warner “at this point”, but things could certainly change in the future. For now, Apple is focused on producing exclusive behind the scenes videos and interviews with artists for Apple Music subscribers. For what it’s worth, Apple was reportedly exploring a Time Warner deal just a few months ago: The Wall Street Journal reported in October 2016 that Apple and Time Warner did have advanced talks about a possible merger.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Apple Stores start selling Will.i.am’s i.am+ Buttons wireless headphones By Steffen Reich, Nov 2, 2016 Tweet 7 Comments Opening their doors this Wednesday morning, Apple Stores across the US will be stocking a new pair of wireless earphones named i.am+ Buttons, conceived by musician and part-time tech enthusiast Will.i.am. The full product name of the earphones is i.am+ Buttons and they will reportedly be offered in four colors, matching Apple’s black, silver, gold and rose gold iPhone range. While the timing of the i.am+ launch could not have been more savory with the AirPods suffering heavy delays, it remains to be seen if will.i.am’s product will be able to capitalize on the door left wide open by Apple. Until now, most i.am+ products have largely been frowned upon for putting fashion center stage. They also come at a hefty $229 price point. According to the i.am+ website, the earphones are going to deliver 6+ hours straight playing time, 6+ hours of talking and boast 120+ hours standby time. Charging takes place through micro USB. On paper, this does stack up ok compared to the AirPods and – if true – tops the active playing time of Apple’s product by about an hour. However, to put it in perspective, Apple have been subjected to wide criticism for pricing their brainchild at a comparatively sane $160. Possibly as an attempt to forestall the heavy backlash in light of the astronomical price tag, i.am+ have teamed up with a host of celebrities such as Kendall Jenner and Naomi Campbell to position the product as an upmarket cross of fashion item and cutting-edge gadget. You can find the i.am+ Buttons on Apple’s website, currently available in gold/black, and black. Meanwhile Apple have not yet updated us on the release date of their own BeatsX earphones, a competing set of wireless in-ear buds. Unlike Buttons, BeatsX will boast a lightning port for charging, Apple’s W1 chip for longer battery life and sell at $149.

(AAPL) Will Kill Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Ended the Free Supercharger Ride Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) New MacBook Pro Is Actually a Monster Hit Recent Posts: The Next Thing Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Kill Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Ended the Free Supercharger Ride Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) New MacBook Pro Is Actually a Monster Hit View All Posts Complaints from professional users are mounting after Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced its new MacBook Pro last week. Now, a noted Apple analyst is predicting the company will move to address some of the issues in a 2017 update, including a price cut to boost sales. Source: Apple Apple unveiled the new MacBook Pro at an event last week, focusing on the new Touch Bar feature and a smaller form factor. However, the reaction from the professional users who form the core base of MacBook Pro buyers was tepid at best. The list of complaints about the new laptops has only been growing since the event. AAPL’s decision to eliminate all legacy ports and the MagSafe power port, replacing them with four USB-C ports, is proving contentious, as is the switch the new keyboard introduced with the MacBook last year. Capping maximum RAM at 16GB is frustrating many power users and adding insult to injury, the new laptops come at a hefty price increase compared to outgoing models. New MacBook Pro Complaints Grow One blog where professional and creative users have been venting is full of pronouncements like this one: “The people at Apple no longer have a clue what is desirable in a computer. At this, Apple is now incompetent. Tim Cook thinks everyone should just use an iPad.” 10 Hottest Gadgets for the 2016 Holiday Shopping Season In other words, the reaction has not been what AAPL was hoping for. Apple’s Mac sales had already been on the decline going into the event, as potential buyers held off in anticipation of the new computers. Judging by the online reaction, many of those AAPL customers are not happy and they may well forgo buying the new MacBook Pro. Apple Insider reports KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is calling for sales of the old MacBook models to remain steady in Q1 2017. However, he is predicting slow demand for the new MacBook Pro to be a drag on sales, resulting in a 15% to 25% decline in overall shipments compared to Q1 2016. What AAPL Might Do in 2017 While the first half of 2017 doesn’t look good for AAPL, things may get better. Time is on the company’s side in the sense that accessory makers are slowly boosting their USB-C offerings. With a growing selection of USB-C products — which offer considerably faster throughput than their predecessors — some of the controversy over axing all the new MacBook Pro’s legacy ports will likely die down. The Touch Bar seems likely to be a factor as well. It’s being written off as a gimmick by some, but six months of having it available may result in the feature being put to good use by software developers.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Here Is Why Apple Chose The Touch Bar On MacBook Pro Instead Of Full Touch Screen Posted: Nov 2 2016, 11:25am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Apple     Many Apple fans are wondering why did Apple go for the Touch Bar instead of a full touch screen display, we might have some answers... In a recent interview given by Apple design chief ,Jony Ive has explained some of the thinking behind the design of the MacBook Pro. Ive also put light on why the company went for the Touch bar instead of full screen touch. Don't Miss: Sam's Club Black Friday 2016 Deals The newly announced 2016 MacBook Pro features an OLED touch based panel on the top of its keyboard. This is the place where previously function keys used to be. This can be changed now as per the software being run and the application being run. The removal of static buttons and replacing them with more lively buttons allows it to be a huge potential as an input source for Apple users. Ive pointed out that creating this bar wasn’t so straight forward. A number of designs were tested before the final version was put together. Ive further explained that perhaps the most difficult part was taking a design and converting it in to a shipping product without detracting the originality of the product. Over the past years many companies have given out great designs but they didn’t quite pull it off right. Apple was remotely aware that sometimes even good designs do not guarantee good results. Apple’s Touch bar can prove to be a huge game changer for MacBooks. It is also expected that the touch bar will make a jump to other devices too. You may expect the physical buttons on your Mac to be obsolete soon.

 Apple's marketing boss says the MacBook Pro ditched a crucial port for photographers because it's 'cumbersome' Jeff Dunn Nov. 2, 2016, 11:36 AM 64,306 facebook linkedin twitter email print The new MacBook Pro, sans Touch Bar.Steve Kovach/Business Insider While Apple's new MacBook Pro looks as though it'll be a powerful notebook for most people, it has generated massive amounts of skepticism within the professional crowd at which it's ostensibly aimed. The common sentiment is that Apple has slashed too many ports and high-level features for the sake of thinness and battery life. There's a small but vocal group of people who think the company has forgotten who the Pro is for. The Pro's high price and RAM limitations have brought the most complaints, but another source of ire is its lack of an SD card slot. In short, that's the thing that lets you pop a high-end camera's memory card into your notebook and quickly transfer photos. Since a lot of professional photographers use MacBook Pros, any of them looking to upgrade might not be happy needing a dongle to do what was simple before. Unfortunately for them, though, it looks as if Apple isn't budging. Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller defended the move in an interview with The Independent, saying the new MacBook Pro lost the port because it was "cumbersome." "You've got this thing sticking halfway out," Schiller said. "Then there are very fine and fast USB card readers, and then you can use CompactFlash as well as SD. So we could never really resolve this — we picked SD because more consumer cameras have SD but you can only pick one. So, that was a bit of a trade-off." Apple SVP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller.Getty Instead, Schiller touted the wireless transfer technologies that are built into many modern cameras. "That's proving very useful," he said. We've been through this song and dance before. Apple has a long, notorious history of ditching ports and standards. People get angry, Apple makes a few bucks off of adapters, and everyone eventually gets used to it. Angry photographers have a legitimate complaint here, though. Though many high-end cameras support wireless transfers, it's difficult to call that tech speedy or reliable. SD cards, as dated as they are, still just work. The new MacBook Pro might force camera companies like Sony or Nikon to do better, but this isn't like the iPhone 7 ditching the headphone jack — Macs don't have the kind of industry-moving market share that iPhones do. Apple Speaking of — though Schiller said the SD slot is worth sacrificing for professional photographers, he defended the decision to keep the Pro's 3.5 mm headphone jack by saying it's necessary for professional audiomakers. "These are pro machines," Schiller said. "If it was just about headphones then it doesn't need to be there; we believe that wireless is a great solution for headphones. But many users have setups with studio monitors, amps, and other pro audio gear that do not have wireless solutions and need the 3.5 mm jack." That seems a bit inconsistent. Ultimately, these gripes are unlikely to deter most MacBook buyers — Schiller claimed Apple has "had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before" — but if you're a photographer or photography enthusiast looking for a new Apple machine, you're in for a transitional period.

Officially Ditches This Intel Corporation Technology in the 15-inch MacBook Pro Apple didn't choose to use Intel's graphics-heavy processors inside its new 15-inch MacBook Pro, but it's not a big deal. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 2, 2016 at 12:00PM With the launch of Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) fourth-generation Core processors came the birth of the company's Iris Pro graphics technology. In a nutshell, Intel created two versions of its H-series laptop processors (aimed at larger, higher-performance laptops): ones with relatively weak on-board graphics, referred to as Intel HD graphics -- and ones with much higher performance graphics, known as Iris Pro. Image source: Apple. The business rationale behind the Iris Pro models was simple to understand: Intel wanted personal computer makers to, instead of paying a graphics-processor vendor for a low-end stand-alone graphics processor, put those extra dollars toward an Intel processor with a roughly comparable integrated graphics processor. It's not hard to see that capturing that dollar content would lift the average selling prices of Intel's processors, ultimately boosting Intel's revenue and gross profit. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) used versions of Intel's fourth-generation Core processors with Iris Pro inside the 15-inch MacBook Pro computers it launched between 2013 and 2015 (but still offered potential buyers the option to choose stand-alone graphics as well). The Mac maker also utilized fifth-generation Core processors with Iris Pro inside the 21.5-inch iMac desktop computers launched in 2015. However, with its latest 15-inch MacBook Pro computers, Apple passed on newer Core i7 processors with Iris Pro; instead, it opted for variants with vanilla Intel HD graphics, and now includes stand-alone graphics processors in all new 15-inch MacBook Pro systems. Although prior leaks showing Intel's future notebook processor plans indicated that Iris Pro was a goner, Apple's processor choice inside of the 15-inch MacBook Pro makes it official. What does this mean for Intel? Although it may seem that this is somewhat bad news for Intel, particularly as the chipmaker likely charged Apple (and the small group of other companies that used the technology) a premium for these parts over what it charges for chips with vanilla HD graphics, over the long term it's not that bad. It could even be a positive development. For one thing, even though Iris Pro appears to have run its course, Intel is still selling Iris-based processors. Iris technology is fundamentally the same as Iris Pro, except it is used in lower-power processors: Iris Pro was found on 45-watt chips, and Iris is used in Intel's premium 15-watt and 28-watt chips. Iris is a much more sensible product, because the kinds of laptops that use 15-watt or 28-watt chips tend not to have the power and space budgets to accommodate a worthwhile stand-alone graphics processor. In contrast, if a system can support a 45-watt processor, it's likely to have the power and space budgets to include a discrete graphics processor as well. Indeed, Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Pro computers use Intel processors with Iris graphics, and the technology seems to be picking up steam with other personal computer makers (such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), VAIO, Dell, and Lenovo Group (NASDAQOTH:LNVGY). So, Intel should still be able to improve its notebook processor mix as it improves the value proposition of its Iris graphics offerings. For Intel's efforts here to succeed, though, customers need to believe that by picking laptops with Iris technology, they will be able to enjoy modern games at reasonable performance and quality settings. That will have to come from a combination of Intel delivering good performance with its Iris technology, and Intel effectively marketing the technology to customers. Intel's mix opportunity beyond graphics It's also important to note that, beginning in the second quarter of 2018, Intel's replacement for the quad-core notebook processors with Iris Pro graphics will be a hex-core processor with vanilla Intel HD graphics. If Intel can command a premium for the six-core part relative to the quad-core part, as it did with the quad-core chips with Iris Pro relative to the quad-core parts with standard Intel HD graphics, then the chipmaker still has an opportunity to sell a richer mix of products. Gaming laptops could be prime candidates for higher-priced, higher-core count processors. And, to be blunt, far more customers (especially in the gaming-laptop and mobile-workstation markets) are likely to be willing to pay extra for more processor cores than to pay extra for more integrated graphics performance. Over the next couple of years, I suspect the removal of Iris Pro from its lineup, coupled with increased focus on Iris graphics for low-power chips and higher CPU core counts for higher-power chips, could help Intel sell a richer notebook processor mix than it does today. Why increasing product mix is important The personal-computer market is generally believed to be in decline, and there's little that Intel can do to change those broader trends. What Intel can do is try to deliver more value with its processors, so that when people do go to purchase personal computers, they have incentive to buy machines with more powerful (and more expensive) Intel processors. More cores is a nice selling point. Intel may even want to consider revamping its branding efforts to make sure customers are aware of which laptops with Core i7 processors pack four cores and which ones have six (though this is a topic for another day). A richer product mix can certainly help to offset unit declines. For example, over the last three quarters combined, Intel says that although its laptop processor unit shipments dropped 1%, average selling prices here went up 2% -- ultimately leading to slight revenue growth. In desktop processors, Intel saw a similar trend, though one not quite as good: Volumes dropped 5%, but the resulting revenue drop was somewhat offset by a 2% increase in average selling prices. The more that Intel can do to sell a richer mix of products in the face of unit-volume shipments which range from flat to slightly down, the better of a shot the company has to keep its PC-related revenues stable over time.

While iOS 10.1 was focused almost entirely on the Portrait Camera for iPhone 7 Plus, iOS 10.2 is packed with interesting features. DON'T MISS: New evidence shines light on a big advantage Galaxy S8 may have over iPhone 8 We discussed the majority of those additions in our original release post for the first beta of iOS 10.2, but 9to5Mac has since put together a comprehensive video showcasing all of the new features and changes worth knowing about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXMvukyb578 For many, the most exciting part of iOS 10.2 will be the addition of 70+ new Unicode 9 emoji. Along with all the new emoji, Apple has also updated some of its existing emoji, so you'll want to take a closer look once you install iOS 10.2. There are also a few new wallpapers (which you can download here without updating to iOS 10.2 beta 1), a Videos app widget in the Notification Center and a new menu to Preserve Settings for the Camera app. Other changes include the return of Star Ratings in the Music app, the ability to sort from within the Music app, the option to hide contact photos in the Messages app, new Home button accessibility settings and a new full screen effect in Messages. But if you want to see all of these additions, features and changes in action, be sure to watch the full video from 9to5Mac above. And if you want iOS 10.2 beta 1 on your phone, read this.

Click here to join our mailing list Yorkshire North West West Mids East Mids Apple growing at city shopping complex2nd November 2016  APPLE is launching a new upsized store in Liverpool ONE’s South John Street. The new store is twice the size of Apple’s previous unit on Paradise Street, which becomes home to Guess later this month. Apple is the most recent in a series of upsizes and new additions to Grosvenor Europe’s Liverpool ONE’s line-up of leading brands.   Victoria’s Secret launched its 9,200sq ft store on South John Street, adjacent to Apple, in July, with the US-lingerie brand also selecting Liverpool ONE to create a new flagship. On Paradise Street, Guess follows the opening of Jack Wolfskin and Rolex, with Urban Decay, Lindt and Smiggle currently fitting out their stores in time for Christmas. Miles Dunnett, director at Grosvenor Europe, said: “Apple’s upsize is yet another great milestone for Liverpool ONE.  Their continued exceptional performance has driven their desire to not only create a larger store, but to deliver a unique retailing experience for visitors. “Apple joins the ever-growing list of additions to Liverpool ONE, and by the end of the year, over 20 new stores will have opened, creating one of the most vibrant, exciting line-ups in the UK.” The news also follows the exclusive launch of the Lego Ideas Beatles Yellow Submarine in Liverpool ONE’s Lego store on October 29. >> Next Article << Previous Article Latest News Slater Heelis LLP Gateley severs Scottish ties Listed law firm has an office in Manchester 6 jobs that didnt exist 10 years ago What were you doing in the office 10 years ago?

Available in black or silver, the Fermata is crafted from aluminum and is designed to house a set of on-ear or over-ear headphones such as Apple's Beats Solo2 and Solo3 wireless models. The headphones rest on a leather-covered hook, which is designed to make sure the headphones don't rub against anything. The Fermata is more than just a simple stand -- it can also charge headphones. There's a reversible micro-USB connector built into the arm of the Fermata, which can be pulled out to connect to headphones that are charged via USB. When not in use, the charging cable tucks back into the back of the stand. If you don't have wireless headphones, the Fermata can still serve as a standard stand, as there's an optional accessory that allows you to wind up a headphone cable to keep it out of the way when not in use. An extra USB port is included at the base of the Fermata, which is able to charge an iPhone or iPad, so you're getting two devices charged from a single outlet. Extra cable is wound into the base of the stand, so there's no clutter of wires on your desk. The Fermata itself charges via a standard wall outlet with an included AC wall charger and a two-meter charging cable. Twelve South's Fermata headphone charging stand is available for purchase in the United States and Japan starting today from the Twelve South website. It's priced at $79.99. An international version will be available in the future. Tag: Twelve South 24 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) pika2000 2 weeks ago Want cheap headphone stands? Just buy some banana holders.

They are deluxe, powerful machines with innovations including the Touch Bar, where the top row of function keys is replaced by a touch-sensitive screen where different functions appear, changing as you change programs. The new models also have a fingerprint sensor built into the power button, to buy stuff online faster than you can say “impulse purchase”. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments In this interview, Philip Schiller, Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, told The Independent all about them. Schiller is a familiar face at Apple keynotes, mixing a dry sense of humour with bullish, on-message statements. Some are controversial: he recently told an audience of 6,000 that Apple was removing the headphone jack from the iPhone 7, for instance. In person, he has an understated charm and a forensic intelligence. If some of my questions seem abrupt, it’s because Schiller understood what I was getting at before I had quite said them. Don’t be fooled by Schiller’s job title. He is across every product the company makes, and passionate, of course, about every one of them. We first talked in an Apple-white private room at Infinite Loop, the company’s Californian headquarters, minutes after the new laptops had been unveiled and followed up a few days later... The keynote video showed Apple laptops from the last 25 years. Seeing it, you can’t predict where the design will go, but each new one it seems like a logical continuation. Yes, and what’s remarkable is as things become smaller the range of big, obvious differences reduce. When you see the history of those notebooks, the first one is 2 ¼ inches thick. There’s a lot of room to make part lines and seams on them and things that create character but as you get to something where it’s so defined by its display and its keyboard, as an iPhone is so defined by that display, the design of how it works becomes much more into incredible, nano-sized details. I can’t even imagine the level of tolerances and small details the team will be working on in a few years from now. The new MacBook Pro is pretty light. It is. Big difference. And more rigid. And dense, too. It’s obviously harder to design something that’s stiffer when it’s so much thinner and the tolerances of the design are so much tighter than ever before on our products. To have this flatness and linearity between the huge trackpad surface and the palm rest, it took a level of engineering not possible before. So some things are transparent to the user, they just think it’s a beautiful product but the level of engineering it takes to make this the way it is, is a tremendous technical challenge compared to the past. The evolution of the Touch Bar – how did it come about? It’s part of our thinking about where to take the notebook next. Others are trying to turn the notebook into the tablet. The new MacBook Pro is a product that celebrates that it is a notebook, this shape that has been with us for the last 25 years is probably going to be with us for another 25 years because there’s something eternal about the basic notebook form factor. You have a surface that you type down on with your hands, with a screen facing you vertically. That basic orientation, that L shape makes perfect sense and won’t go away. The team came up with this idea that you can create a multi-touch surface that’s coplanar with the keyboard and the trackpad but brings a whole new experience into it, one that’s more interactive, with multi-touch. Will macOS and iOS (the operating systems for Macs and iPhones) always be different? We’re steadfast in our belief that there are fundamentally two different products to make for customers and they’re both important. There’s iPhone and iPad which are single pieces of glass, they’re direct-manipulation, multi-touch and tend towards full-screen applications. And that’s that experience. And we want to make those the best in that direction anyone can imagine. We have a long road ahead of us on that. Then there’s the Mac experience, dominated by our notebooks and that’s about indirect manipulation and cursors and menus. We want to make this the best experience we can dream of in this direction. Here’s one example of how they should remain distinct: the Mac from the very first has had a menu bar fixed at the top. It’s core to the identity and the experience you get. But iOS doesn’t have a menu at the top. It never will. The thought of pointing at a menu at the top of an iPhone feels wrong. If you made the Mac a touchscreen you’d have to figure out how to make it a good experience with your finger on a touchscreen. Trust me, we’ve looked at that — it’s a bad experience. It’s not as good or as intuitive as with a mouse and trackpad. The new Pros have no SD card slot for a camera memory card. Why not? Because of a couple of things. One, it’s a bit of a cumbersome slot. You've got this thing sticking halfway out. Then there are very fine and fast USB card readers, and then you can use CompactFlash as well as SD. So we could never really resolve this – we picked SD because more consumer cameras have SD but you can only pick one. So, that was a bit of a trade-off. And then more and more cameras are starting to build wireless transfer into the camera. That’s proving very useful. So we think there’s a path forward where you can use a physical adaptor if you want, or do wireless transfer. Is it inconsistent to keep the 3.5mm headphone jack as it’s no longer on the latest iPhone? Not at all. These are pro machines. If it was just about headphones then it doesn’t need to be there, we believe that wireless is a great solution for headphones. But many users have setups with studio monitors, amps, and other pro audio gear that do not have wireless solutions and need the 3.5mm jack. Tell me about Siri on the Mac. We waited quite a while to bring Siri to the Mac because we didn’t want to bring it until it could do some things Mac users would really require, like file searching and things like that. We could have brought it earlier without that but it wouldn’t have made as much sense to us. But there’s no “Hey Siri”, where you can invoke the voice assistant by just speaking to it, on the Mac? That has more to do with system electronics and low power capabilities. You would want to be able to say “Hey Siri” from across the room even when your Mac is asleep, so if you still have to go across the room to wake the Mac, then what’s the point? You need to build system-wide electronics that are in the right standby state, listening for that catchphrase and that’s not built into the electronics of Mac today. Yesterday, I caught up with Mr Schiller again, to assess public reactions to the new products How would you describe the response to the new MacBook Pro? There has certainly been a lot of passionate dialogue and debate about the new MacBook Pro! Many things have impressed people about it, and some have caused some controversy. I hope everyone gets a chance to try it for themselves and see how great the MacBook Pro is. It is a really big step forward and an example of how much we continue to invest in the Mac. We love the Mac and are as committed to it, in both desktops and notebooks, as we ever have been. And we are proud to tell you that so far our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before. So there certainly are a lot of people as excited as we are about it. Are you surprised by how vocal the critics have been? To be fair it has been a bit of a surprise to me. But then, it shouldn’t be. I have never seen a great new Apple product that didn’t have its share of early criticism and debate — and that’s cool. We took a bold risk, and of course with every step forward there is also some change to deal with. Our customers are so passionate, which is amazing. We care about what they love and what they are worried about. And it's our job to help people through these changes. We know we made good decisions about what to build into the new MacBook Pro and that the result is the best notebook ever made, but it might not be right for everyone on day one. That’s okay, some people felt that way about the first iMac and that turned out pretty good.

We thought Apple would conclude the wait with a laptop that would last with us for years, but instead we got a transitional device that bridges the perpetual gap between present and future with the metal corpses of (almost) every useful port we now use and rely on. Apple’s position is clear: you either sign up for its vision of wireless and USB-C communications dominating everything, or you go elsewhere. For those adventurous MacBook users who are now finding themselves more open to exploring Windows waters, here’s a quick rundown of the top alternatives to Apple’s new, port-less MacBook Pro. Dell XPS 13 Dell This laptop is the most obvious and direct alternative to the MacBook Pro. Dell’s 13-inch XPS 13 has a wonderfully minimal bezel around the display, a great keyboard, good trackpad, solid construction, and attractive design. Its battery life stretches up to 10 hours and it has recently been upgraded with Intel’s 7th-generation (Kaby Lake) processors, a generation ahead of Apple’s latest MacBook Pros. Handsome, affordable, and a proven design that won’t spring any surprises: there’s very little wrong about the Dell XPS 13. It can be had with 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and that lovely gold shell above for $1,199. To get it with a high-resolution (3,200 x 1,800) touchscreen display, you’d have to step up to $1,449, but that’s still $50 less than the MBP and it manages to fit an SD card reader and two regular USB ports alongside the Thunderbolt 3 connector. Razer Blade Stealth Razer This one, I’m less confident about, but it sure is a stunning piece of machinery, isn’t it? Razer’s 12.5-inch Blade Stealth is the gaming gear maker’s first ultrabook, and it does the whole aluminum unibody thing in a gorgeous matte black highlighted by the company’s signature Chroma keyboard backlighting. You can have it with a Quad HD (2,560 x 1,440) display, a Kaby Lake CPU, 256GB of storage, regular USB and a Thunderbolt 3-capable USB-C for $1,250. Now, granted, the Blade Stealth is kind of in a funny position with its own lack of an SD card slot, and its battery life won’t rival the MacBook Pro’s, but Razer’s secret weapon with this laptop is the ability to plug it into the company’s Core box. For another $400, the Core lets you hook up a full desktop graphics card to the Blade Stealth, which raises it gaming ceiling exponentially, lending this laptop a unique advantage that many in its category lack. HP Spectre x360 Props to my colleague Dan Seifert for calling this one out as a very attractive escape route for dissatisfied MacBook users. HP’s newly updated 13-inch Spectre x360 has an edge-to-edge display much like Dell’s XPS 13, but it also has a fully rotating hinge like Lenovo’s Yogas. It’s got a quad-speaker array, and HP makes some terrific claims about it lasting up to 15 hours on a single charge — even if it only achieves two-thirds of that claim, it seems likely to be able to keep you productive through a whole day’s work. At 2.85lbs (1.29kg), the 13.3-inch HP Spectre x360 is lighter than Apple’s corresponding new MacBook Pro. It also has two USB-C ports, but HP doesn’t forget to include a regular USB one "for added flexibility." Alas, this super thin and light computer does lack an SD card slot, so you’d have to go to the 4lbs (1.81kg), 15-inch model to have that photographer-favored port. Still, with prices starting at $1,159, there’s a lot of headroom to max out a Spectre x360’s spec before reaching even the entry-level MacBook Pro’s cost. Worth considering. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga I saw this laptop at IFA 2016, and The Verge’s Tom Warren reviewed it very recently. Our shared conclusion? The ThinkPad X1 Yoga has a couple of foibles, but its OLED display is easily among the very best we’ve seen on a laptop. Spanning a resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 and including touch capabilities, it’s pretty close to our ideal laptop display. Being a Yoga laptop also means this one can rotate a full 360-degrees, which doesn’t matter on a daily basis but is a nice extra to have. Apple’s MacBooks have always opened to just a little bit past vertical, which can be problematic when they’re used in bed or in any other circumstances that are less than ideal. Now, buying into this OLED futurism isn’t cheap, and the ThinkPad X1 Yoga with OLED starts at $1,682 right now, but I’d say this is a much more enticing use of the technology than Apple’s thin strip of it above the keyboard (aka the Touch Bar). Microsoft Surface Book Well, it couldn’t be a roundup of the best Windows computers without one from Microsoft, now could it? The newly refreshed Surface Book has more of everything: more power, longer battery life, and a higher price. Kicking off at a mighty $2,399, this 13.5-inch laptop includes a stylus and a touchscreen along with an SD card slot and some trusty old USB ports. The display is detachable from the base, and there’s a discrete Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M graphics chip to amp things up. The biggest advantage of this upgraded Surface Book is Microsoft’s claimed 16 hours of battery life, which is an extraordinarily long endurance by any laptop category’s standards. And it doesn’t weigh all that much, either, at 3.63lbs (1.65kg). As its screen size, weight, and price suggest, the Surface Book sits somewhere between Apple’s 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models, but it offers plenty of functionality (and ports) that Apple’s new computers lack.

Apple unveiled its new 2016 MacBook Pro lineup just last week, and the company is already boasting about record numbers. Apple wouldn't say exactly how many new MacBook Pros the company has sold so far, of course. But the response has apparently been phenomenal, in spite of the many quirks of the new machine that have received plenty of negative coverage around the web. DON’T MISS: New evidence shines light on a big advantage Galaxy S8 may have over iPhone 8 “There has certainly been a lot of passionate dialogue and debate about the new MacBook Pro! Many things have impressed people about it, and some have caused some controversy,” Apple’s Phil Schiller told The Independent in an interview. “I hope everyone gets a chance to try it for themselves and see how great the MacBook Pro is. It is a really big step forward and an example of how much we continue to invest in the Mac. We love the Mac and are as committed to it, in both desktops and notebooks, as we ever have been.” Schiller continued, “And we are proud to tell you that so far our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before. So there certainly are a lot of people as excited as we are about it.” The top Apple exec also explained some of Apple’s more controversial decisions surrounding the design of the new MacBook Pro. On the removal of the SD slot There’s no SD slot on the MacBook Pro “because of a couple of things.” “One, it’s a bit of a cumbersome slot. You've got this thing sticking halfway out. Then there are very fine and fast USB card readers, and then you can use CompactFlash as well as SD. So we could never really resolve this – we picked SD because more consumer cameras have SD, but you can only pick one,” Schiller said. “So, that was a bit of a trade-off. And then more and more cameras are starting to build wireless transfer into the camera. That’s proving very useful. So we think there’s a path forward where you can use a physical adapter if you want, or do wireless transfer.” On keeping the standard 3.5mm audio jack When asked whether it’s inconsistent for Apple to keep the 3.5mm headphone jack on the MacBook Pro but remove it from the latest iPhone, Schiller said it makes perfect sense. “These are pro machines,” he said. “If it was just about headphones then it doesn’t need to be there, we believe that wireless is a great solution for headphones. But many users have setups with studio monitors, amps, and other pro audio gear that do not have wireless solutions and need the 3.5mm jack.” There you have it. This is Apple's logic, straight from the horse's mouth, behind killing one feature many people use while keeping another feature that even more people need. Schiller’s full interview is available right here.

LeBron James, star of new videos for Sprite and Nike, couldn't catch Shell either. Microsoft, with a showcase of the new Surface Studio that "out-Appled Apple," came closest.

Ryan Collins, 36, from Pennsylvania, used a scam called phishing in which he sent out emails requesting login details that more than 100 victims, mostly famous females, thought were from Apple and Google. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments The hacker has now been sentenced to 18 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to federal hacking charges and admitting to a two-year phishing scam to gain passwords of more than 100 people, including comedian Patrick Kielty's So You Think You Can Dance presenter wife, Cat Deeley, Hunger Games actress Jennifer Lawrence and singers Rihanna and Avril Lavigne. TV host Cat, 40, who recently gave birth to a son, was left stunned after her own nude and topless pictures, some of which featured her 45-year-old Co Down comedian husband, ended up online for millions of people to see in 2014. The images appeared to show intimate moments between Cat and Patrick on holiday in a hotel room. "In some cases, Collins would use a software program to download the entire contents of the victims' Apple iCloud backups," said Pennsylvania attorney, Bruce Brandler. "In addition, Collins ran a modelling scam in which he tricked his victims into sending him nude photographs." In total, investigators found that Collins had gained access to at least 50 Apple iCloud accounts and 72 Gmail accounts. One of Collins' victims, Oscar-winner Jennifer Lawrence, had 60 of her private images uploaded to the internet. "It is not a scandal - it is a sex crime," the Hollywood actress told Vanity Fair. Victim: Cat Deeley Glamorous couple Patrick Kielty and wife Cat Deeley at an event in Los Angeles Cat Deeley and Patrick Kielty married in 2012 Patrick Kielty and Cat Deeley "It is a sexual violation. It's disgusting. The law needs to be changed, and we need to change." While Cat has never spoken publicly about the privacy breach, her name has appeared on several lists naming the hacker's targets. Collins was originally charged in Los Angeles, where he had faced up to five years in jail and a $250,000 fine, but the case was transferred closer to his home in Pennsylvania, where the dad-of-two was sentenced to 18 months behind bars. His LinkedIn profile states that Collins began working as a creative project manager for a digital marketing firm in April 2015. He gained a bachelor's degree in integrated science and technology from James Madison University in 2003. His wife is licensed in Pennsylvania as a psychologist and works at a local hospital, according to her LinkedIn profile. But Ryan Collins has also shown an interest in becoming a personal chef, posting "the culinary world is where my true passion lies." Collins' victims unwittingly handed over passwords to their online accounts - allowing him to pinch their private pictures and videos between November 2012 and September 2014. Other well known faces that fell for the scam included supermodel Kate Upton and popstar Ariana Grande. Patrick and Cat will be glad the hacker who intruded into their private lives has finally been prosecuted as they embarked on their new journey as parents earlier this year. The low-key couple, who wed in an intimate Rome ceremony back in 2012, had been friends for a decade before tying the knot, and welcomed son Milo into the world in January. Based in LA, they also have homes in London and Dundrum.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search The SD slot had to die, Apple’s Phil Schiller insists: Here’s why Chris Davies - Nov 2, 2016 16 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Apple’s decision to go all-Thunderbolt 3 with the new MacBook Pro is still, a week after the event, causing controversy, and now Phil Schiller has waded in to make the official argument. The decision to drop USB Type-A, HDMI, and other ports in favor of the multi-functional – but decidedly rarer – Thunderbolt 3 has seen many pro-users up in arms, but it’s the absence of the SD card slot that has many truly fuming. According to Schiller, Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, it’s a slot that’d had its day. Speaking to the Independent, both just after the new MacBook Pro had been announced and then again a few days later, amid some of the more fiery furore, Schiller proved resolute in Apple’s decision. According to the exec, the decision to include an SD reader on the MacBook Pro originally had always been a compromise. Nonetheless, if you’re not a fan of dongles and adapters, you probably won’t be satisfied. “One, it’s a bit of a cumbersome slot,” Schiller points out. “You’ve got this thing sticking halfway out. Then there are very fine and fast USB card readers, and then you can use CompactFlash as well as SD. So we could never really resolve this – we picked SD because more consumer cameras have SD but you can only pick one. So, that was a bit of a trade-off.” While it’s true that, at one point CompactFlash and SD were rivaling technologies in camera storage, that’s not so much the case today. Improvements in SD card speed, as well as capacity, has seen CompactFlash sidelined, particularly as camera companies adopt smaller systems like Micro Four Thirds and a similarly smaller memory chip becomes a real advantage. Then again, Schiller is hoping the camera makers themselves will marginalize the missing slot as an issue too. That’s because “more and more cameras are starting to build wireless transfer into the camera,” Schiller points out. He’s certainly not wrong in that we’re seeing cameras spread from the consumer range through to prosumer and professional with built-in WiFi. All the same, the experience can be lacking in comparison to the convenience of taking out a memory card and plugging it into a native port. For instance, while most of Olympus’ recent cameras, like the PEN-F, have WiFi, it’s not designed for connecting to a computer. Instead, it works with the company’s mobile app for iOS and Android, the concept being that you can shoot images and then quickly share them via social or email. There’s actually no official way to connect the camera wirelessly to a laptop, however. I’ve used it frequently, and it can be convenient when I’m trying to get photos out quickly at events where sitting down and pulling out a laptop would be too much hassle, but it’s a far slower process overall. The speed of a memory card slot, or of a USB 3.0 card reader as I use – complete with USB Type-C adapter – with the 12-inch MacBook, is considerably faster. That’s even with the camera downscaling the original resolution considerably before it squirts the pictures over wirelessly. NOW READ: New MacBook Pro 13″ first-look There are fixes, of course, if it behooved the camera companies to invest in them. Most camera WiFi is 802.11n at best; an 802.11ac radio could be considerably faster. Meanwhile, just as Apple is seemingly provoking the third-party peripheral market to accelerate its Thunderbolt 3 efforts, forcing the SD issue might also encourage camera makers to develop wireless tethering apps for macOS. If it’s prompted no small amount of chatter and disagreement, then Apple doesn’t seem to be hurting for orders. According to Schiller, “our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before”; as normal, Apple isn’t giving specific sales figures. Some of that is undoubtedly because existing MacBook Pro users, having waited in some cases many years to upgrade old notebooks, can’t hold out any longer, but it may well be that the port and card slot limitation isn’t quite the storm it currently seems to be.

The good news is that Twitter user @heyeased back with a fresh new batch of awesomely glitchy wallpapers, and they're some of his best ones so far. The bad news is that Apple has finally decided to put an end to all the fun in iOS 10.2, so this is probably the last batch of glitch wallpapers that iPhone users will ever be able to enjoy. Not sure what we're talking about? Let's backtrack a bit. MUST SEE: Amazon’s huge Black Friday 2016 sales event is has officially begun As a result of a mysterious bug in iOS, certain wallpapers cause fun side effects on the iPhone and allow users to customize their iPhone interfaces in fun and unique ways. The wallpapers were created by Twitter user @heyeased, and each one is actually only one pixel square. For whatever reason, when one-pixel images are set as the wallpaper on the iPhone, it causes the dock and folder background to glitch or even disappear. The black version of the wallpaper is a fan favorite among black and jet black iPhone owners, but there are many more available in a wide range of colors. Now, back to the good news and the bad news we mentioned earlier. @heyeased has posted two new batches of glitch wallpapers and they're some of his most creative ones yet. The first batch consists of a wide range of solid colors that all have the same effect as the original black wallpaper — they make the dock and the folder background the same color as the wallpaper, effectively making them invisible. You can check them all out and download them for free in this post on his site. The second batch is our personal favorite. These wallpapers have one background color and a second contrasting color for the dock and folders, resulting in a look as seen in the image above. There are two full pages of different color combinations, and you can find them all in this post. As a reminder, all you need to do is tap and hold on any wallpaper in Safari to save it to your Photos app, then open it in photos and apply it as your wallpaper. Just make sure that “Reduce Transparency” is not enabled (open Settings > General > Accessibility > Increase Contrast and toggle “Reduce Transparency” to off). These wallpapers will work on any recent version of iOS 9, iOS 10 or iOS 10.1, but don't update to the newly released iOS 10.2 beta if you want to use any of them. That's right, Apple finally decided to fix the bug that caused these fun, harmless glitches. Oh well, it was fun while it lasted. And of note, the nifty optical illusion wallpapers we told you about all still work.

(Emojipedia) Josh Elliott, CTVNews.ca Published Wednesday, November 2, 2016 10:41AM EDT David Bowie, clowns and Harambe the gorilla are coming with the next Apple update. And if any of those ideas make you want to face palm, well, there will be an emoji for that, too. Apple appears poised to roll out a boatload of new emojis with its upcoming iOS 10.2 update, as indicated by a developer version of the smartphone software released this week. The update includes a wide range of smiley-face, profession, gesture and pop culture-related icons, using the full list of 72 emojis approved by regulator Unicode in June. More alternate-gender versions of existing emojis are being introduced, along with a wide range of jobs including astronaut, painter, firefighter and teacher. Other notable emojis include a pregnant woman, a clown face (for all the creepy clown costume enthusiasts), and a "rock star" icon with David Bowie's iconic Ziggy Stardust makeup. Additionally, new gesture-based emojis like the shrug, the scowl, the face palm and a hand snapping a selfie are being added. In terms of animals, the emoji catalogue will soon look like a virtual Noah's Ark, with a bat, a deer, a butterfly, a shark and a duck among the new additions. However, the most popular new animal online is sure to be the gorilla. Many internet users have already named the emoji Harambe, for the male gorilla shot dead at a zoo in the U.S. earlier this year. The animal's death sparked a wave of outrage online, followed by an irreverent, tongue-in-cheek series of memes. In that spirit, many turned to Twitter to celebrate the arrival of Harambe in emoji form.

But then October passed and November has already started and there is still no signs of the AirPods. Now, a Chinese report from the supply chain is saying the AirPods will not ship until January 2017. Apple issued a statement delaying the launch of the AirPods at the last moment, saying it needed some more time to fine-tune the product. Apple did not give a release date and various reports suggested it will take a while and will likely miss out on the Christmas holiday season sales. If the reports are accurate, the AirPods will take another three more months to be ready for the masses. A week back, Apple released a statement saying they needed more time. An excerpt from that statement is as follows: “The early response to AirPods has been incredible. We don’t believe in shipping a product before it’s ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers.” Apple has not commented on the recent speculations. The AirPods run on a completely new wireless technology developed by Apple. It features the W1 chip that allows for instant pairing with iOS devices. The W1 chip is also present in Apple's Beats Solo 3 wireless and Powerbeats 3 wireless headphones. AirPods come with a 5-hour battery life on each earbud and the carrying case that ships with the earbuds also double up as a charger with enough power to charge each buds for 24 hours of continuous use. None of the report elaborate on what is taking Apple so long to ship the AirPods and neither does Apple's statement for the same.

Part one of this series explained the concept of MAC address randomization and the motivations behind such schemes being employed by major operating system vendors, including Microsoft and Apple. This article looks at how these randomization schemes are implemented and executed, as well as the potential risks involved. MAC address randomization implementations Two of the most popular MAC address randomization implementations are those in Apple iOS and Microsoft Windows. Starting with iOS 8, Apple's mobile OS has been shipping with MAC address randomization support. Essentially, iOS randomizes the MAC addresses of the Probe Request packets that are employed for discovering Wi-Fi networks, to avoid the nodes from being tracked and/or identified while they are simply discovering Wi-Fi networks. Once a suitable network has been discovered, iOS will employ the real hardware MAC address when connecting to that network (i.e., associating with the corresponding access point). This means that a node will not leak its identity when moving around without connecting to any networks, but advertise its presence when actually connecting to a Wi-Fi network. As it should be obvious, since the real MAC address is employed when connecting to a network, the MAC address will remain globally-unique, permanent and stable across networks. Another popular operating system that ships with MAC address randomization is Microsoft Windows 10. However, the randomization scheme employed by Windows 10 has improved properties over that of iOS 8: it is meant to produce randomized MAC addresses that are stable within each network, but that changes as the node moves from one network to another. Windows 10 generates random MAC addresses with the expression: SHA256(SSID, MAC_address, connectionID, secret) Where: SHA256(): Cryptographic hash function; SSID: The Service Set Identifier (SSID) of the network the node is attaching to; MAC_address: Real MAC address of the underlying network interface card; ConnectionID: A value that changes each time the user removes and re-adds the corresponding network (i.e., when the user forgets and subsequently connects to this network); and Secret: A random number generated during system initialization, and maintained in nonvolatile memory. The actual randomized MAC address is obtained by extracting the low-order 48-bits from the result of the function above, and setting the g/l bit (b1 bit) of the address to indicate "locally administered address." Based on the equation above, a node that connects to, say, network X will configure the address A, while the same node will configure the address B when subsequently connecting to a different network, Y -- since the SSID of the network will typically change from network X to network Y. If the node eventually connects back to network X, it will configure, again, the address A -- since all the parameters to the SHA256() function will be the same as in the original case. Note that the randomization scheme employed by Windows 10 is essentially a layer-2 version of the algorithm originally specified in IETF RFC7217 for generating IPv6 addresses. MAC address randomization risks Both of the MAC address randomization schemes discussed earlier in this article result in addresses that are stable within each Wi-Fi network -- with those generated by iOS 8 being actually constant across networks. These schemes should, in principle, result in addresses with the same per-network stability properties as those of the traditional permanent MAC addresses, and hence not represent any operational challenges on existing networks. However, MAC address randomization could be thought of as work in progress, and one might expect that different operating systems may implement more aggressive randomization schemes that do not result in similar stability properties. In such cases, any applications or tools that rely on the stability of MAC addresses, such as web portals for internet access, might break. Besides, it is still an open question how MAC address randomization might affect networking and security devices that, while prepared to handle a decent number of MAC addresses, might need to handle a larger number of addresses if nodes reconfigure different randomized MAC addresses over short periods of time, and/or upon network reconnections. Ongoing work on privacy-enhanced protocols Even in the presence of the MAC address randomization and improved IP address generation -- see RFC7217 -- a plethora of improperly-generated numeric identifiers are typically employed throughout the protocol stack, thus still resulting in information leakages that may be leveraged to perform similar attacks to those discussed earlier in this article. Because of this, further work is required from standards organizations such as the IEEE and the IETF so that these traditional flaws are eliminated and the privacy properties of different protocols are improved.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 2, 2016 at 10:00AM On Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) most recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said that "worldwide demand for both iPhone 7 and 7 Plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on the iPhone 7 Plus." Apple's jet black iPhone 7 Plus is in high demand. Image source: Apple.  Later in the call, when asked by an analyst whether the company expected to reach supply/demand balance by the end of the quarter with respect to both iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, Cook said: It's hard to say. I believe that on iPhone 7 we will. On iPhone 7 Plus, I'm not sure. I wouldn't say yes at this point, because the underlying demand looks extremely strong on both products, but particularly on the iPhone 7 Plus versus our forecast going into the product launch. For Apple, the fact that the iPhone 7 Plus is selling better than expected, compared with its expectations relative to the iPhone 7, is both a blessing and a curse. Here's why. It's good to see strong demand for the Plus The good news for Apple is that if the mix of iPhone 7 Plus it sells relative to iPhone 7 remains significantly higher throughout the current product cycle, then Apple could be looking at a not-so-trivial boost in average selling prices. In the past, Apple's Plus models would sell for a $100 premium relative to their regular-sized counterparts -- already a hefty premium. This year, each iPhone 7 Plus model sells for a full $120 more than the corresponding iPhone 7 model, so the potential average selling price upside this year from a mix shift toward the Plus is much greater this time around than it was in prior cycles. Indeed, had the mix of demand between the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus simply remained constant relative to prior generation models -- which is probably what Apple had planned for, as past performance is arguably the best indicator of future performance -- the $20 increase alone would have helped Apple's iPhone average selling prices. But the combination of the higher average selling price and richer mix of unit shipments could prove quite a boon for the iDevice maker's iPhone revenue. In a nutshell, the richer-than-expected mix of Plus sales, combined with the price increase on this year's Plus models relative to those from the last two product cycles, is obviously good news for Apple. It'd be bad if Apple can't reach supply/demand balance during the quarter Robust demand for higher-priced devices is good news, but if the company can't satisfy it in a timely fashion, that could potentially be bad news. Ideally, any demand for the iPhone 7 Plus that ultimately can't be met during the current quarter would just be pushed out to the following quarter. I suspect that this will be the case for most of the demand that's unmet during the quarter, but not for all of it. Indeed, many of Apple's competitors release new flagship devices in the February-March time frame, so if a customer is stuck waiting too long to get his or her hands on the iPhone 7 Plus, he or she may simply decide to wait and see what the other smartphone vendors bring to the table -- lowering the odds that this customer will ultimately choose an iPhone 7 Plus. In a nutshell, for Apple to maximize its iPhone revenue in 2017, it has to crank out more iPhone 7 Plus devices as quickly as possible. Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Trending in Apple Poll: What is your view of the all-USB-C ports on the new MacBook Pro? November 2 AAPL: 111.59 0.10 Opinion: No SD Card slot? It’s the camera companies you should be upset with, not Apple Jeff Benjamin - 2 weeks ago @JeffBenjam Apps & Updates MacBook Pro View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit When I first learned that the new MacBook Pro had no SD Card slot, like many creators, I was a little perturbed. The reason is that SD Cards have long been the fastest way to transfer media from cameras to our computers. But now that the new MacBook Pros have no built-in SD Card reader, it means that creators will have to rely on an external USB-C to SD Card dongle, like this one. These dongles are cheap, small, and easy to carry around, so at the end of the day it’s not an outright dealbreaker, but the fact that I have to remember to always carry one with me presents somewhat of an inconvenience. That said, we shouldn’t be mad at Apple for this. Camera companies have had years to innovate in this area, and have simply failed to do so. It’s the camera companies that we should be upset with, not Apple. Take, for instance, my Sony RX 100, or any other popular camera released in the last five years. What is the common thread between these cameras? Slow sub-USB 3.x camera connections and terrible wireless connectivity options. In other words, as creators we’re basically forced to eject the SD Card from our cameras and connect it directly to our computers if we want the file transfer to finish in a reasonable amount of time. Imagine trying to import a 10 GB 4K video via USB 2.0. It’s an absolute non-starter. Now think about how long USB 3.x has been available? Exactly, it’s the camera companies that are slow to innovate. Hence, it’s the camera companies that should be called out for this predicament. @marcoarment the most painful thing is the lack of an SD Card reader. Such an instrumental tool for creatives of all kinds. 😞 — Jeff Benjamin (@JeffBenjam) November 2, 2016 My knee-jerk reaction was to lash out at Apple for ditching the SD Card slot, but in a recent interview with The Independent, Apple’s SVP of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, made some excellent points: “One, it’s a bit of a cumbersome slot. You’ve got this thing sticking halfway out. Then there are very fine and fast USB card readers, and then you can use CompactFlash as well as SD. So we could never really resolve this – we picked SD because more consumer cameras have SD but you can only pick one. So, that was a bit of a trade-off.” I agree with Schiller’s opinion about the cumbersome slot, and the way the SD Card sticks halfway out. It’s unsightly. Not to mention that I’ve had several SD Cards simply fail on me due to the wear and tear this places on cards. It’s a situation that creators shouldn’t have to deal with. Phil goes on to opine about the usefulness of wireless transfer ability built into today’s cameras. In that regard, I couldn’t disagree more. Wireless transfer in the majority of today’s cameras is a downright abysmal experience. Not only is the wireless transfer slow, but getting it set up with the camera’s clunky menu system makes most people not even want to bother. Again, the majority of these issues fall squarely on the shoulders of the lackadaisical camera companies. They are the ones who makes arduous menu systems that make it feel like you’re navigating an obstacle course, they are the ones who use slow interfaces, and they are the ones who continue to use inferior wireless technology. There are a few cameras that buck the current trend, such as Canon’s flagship 5D Mark IV, which features USB 3 connectivity. But it’s almost 2017, and this is a trend that should have proliferated years ago. Creators should demand better from camera companies, and anyone else who continues to use antiquated sub-USB 3.x interfaces on their products. Yes, it’s an inconvenience that new MacBook Pro owners have to rely on external USB-C to SD Card dongles for transferring large media files, but that’s not Apple’s fault. We have to start demanding that camera companies do better.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Phil Schiller on why MacBook Pro has headphone jack, lacks SD card slot & more By Christian Zibreg, Nov 2, 2016 Tweet 45 Comments Phil Schiller, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, sat down for an exclusive wide-ranging interview with British newspaper The Independent. He talked the MacBook Pro controversy, explaining why the refreshed notebook has retained the 3.5mm analog headphone jack, but lost an SD card slot. He also touched upon a few other controversial topics, like Apple’s product philosophy when it comes to the notebook form factor in general and the company’s stubborn refusal to release a touchscreen-enabled Mac. The reason the new MacBook Pro did away with an SD card slot? Because of a couple of things. One, it’s a bit of a cumbersome slot. You’ve got this thing sticking halfway out. Then there are very fine and fast USB card readers, and then you can use CompactFlash as well as SD. So we could never really resolve this – we picked SD because more consumer cameras have SD but you can only pick one. While admitting that that was “a bit of a trade-off,” Schiller pointed out that digital cameras increasingly have built-in wireless transfer. “We think there’s a path forward where you can use a physical adaptor if you want, or do wireless transfer,” he said. What about the 3.55mm headphone jack? Why’s it present on the Pro, but nowhere to be seen on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus? That’s because “these are pro machines” and many pros use studio monitors, amps and other audio gear “that do not have wireless solutions and need the 3.5mm jack.” The Touch Bar was born out of Apple’s thinking about where to take the notebook next, Schiller said. “Others are trying to turn the notebook into the tablet,” he said. But what about a touchscreen Mac? Will Apple finally add a touchscreen to the Mac now that Microsoft has made a splash with its innovative Surface Studio all-in-one desktop? According to Schiller, Apple is steadfast in its belief that the Mac and the iPhone are fundamentally two different products. There’s iPhone and iPad which are single pieces of glass, they’re direct-manipulation, multi-touch and tend towards full-screen applications. Then there’s the Mac experience, dominated by our notebooks and that’s about indirect manipulation and cursors and menus. Here’s one example of how they should remain distinct: the Mac from the very first has had a menu bar fixed at the top. It’s core to the identity and the experience you get. But iOS doesn’t have a menu at the top. It never will. The thought of pointing at a menu at the top of an iPhone feels wrong. If you made the Mac a touchscreen you’d have to figure out how to make it a good experience with your finger on a touchscreen. Trust me, we’ve looked at that — it’s a bad experience. It’s not as good or as intuitive as with a mouse and trackpad. Apple’s Chief Design Officer Jony Ive said a similar thing about the prospect for a touchscreen iMac in an interesting interview with CNET last week. Schiller thinks the notebook form factor is going to be with us for another 25 years “because there’s something eternal about the basic notebook form factor.” You have a surface that you type down on with your hands, with a screen facing you vertically. That basic orientation, that L shape makes perfect sense and won’t go away. The team came up with this idea that you can create a multi-touch surface that’s coplanar with the keyboard and the trackpad but brings a whole new experience into it, one that’s more interactive, with multi-touch. The new MacBook Pro is thinner and lighter than its predecessor with the tolerances of the design being “so much tighter than ever before on our products.” “I can’t even imagine the level of tolerances and small details the team will be working on in a few years from now,” he added. The Apple executive also said that Apple could have brought Siri to the Mac earlier, but ultimately decided against releasing the feature until it could do some Mac-specific things, like search your files and documents. “Hey Siri” is not part of Siri for Mac, Schiller continued, because Macs currently lack specialized ultra low-power chips like the embedded M-series motion coprocessor on iOS devices which can listen for a hot word without engaging the main CPU. “You need to build system-wide electronics that are in the right standby state, listening for that catchphrase and that’s not built into the electronics of Mac today,” he explained. Besides, you would want to use Hey Siri on a Mac even the machine is in sleep mode, which isn’t really possible in a power-friendly way without a dedicated onboard chip. Many things about the new MacBook Pro “have impressed” people about it and some “have caused some controversy,” Schiller acknowledged. We care about what they love and what they’re worried about. And it’s our job to help people through these changes. We know we made good decisions about what to build into the new Pro and that the result is the best notebook ever made, but it might not be right for everyone on day one. That’s OK, some people felt that way about the first iMac and that turned out pretty good. According to Schiller, Apple’s webstore has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before. “We love the Mac and are as committed to it, in both desktops and notebooks, as we ever have been,” he said.

Now I gotta walk around with two headphones because I lost the dongle PhoneTechJay “Now I gotta” but you can just get another adapter.. JohnS The one issue with that is that Apple doesn’t want people making or using lightning based headphones. They want people to go wireless, and including a lightning port on the laptop would have encouraged 3rd party manufacturers to start making even more lightning headsets. Past0rB I only wish they’d put at least a lightning port on these new MBPs. Then your EarPods would’ve been cross-platform usable as well as our iPhone VGA and HDMI dongles could’ve been used instead of buying $200+ in new ones. Andrieux Querido No SD Slot is a kick in the nuts. No good for Photographers like me. Merman123 Take your cumbersome slot elsewhere. SMH. What a shit response. Like adapters and dongles are very convenient and pretty. Digitalfeind You don’t have to be an ass to him. “What a shit response.” Likewise. Merman123 I meant a shit response from Schiller not the person I replied to. I am concurring with him. Andrieux Querido As you wrote in your useless text… What a shitty response !!! n0ahcruz3 “Can’t innovate my ass” – removes some ports.. genius. Lol Alex Wilson Pure profit motivation, this is the new Apple “courage” that Tim tried to dump on everyone. Cut a few parts, add a gizmo but don’t up the game. Last thing I’d want is to carry around a bunch of adapters. But the biggest insult of all was getting rid of the MagPort. JohnS Unlike the phone where adapters have no place to go other than… Your pocket or something laptops at least often have a bag designed to carry cables and accessories and keep them organized. Which makes this far less of a hassle. Second if you’re designing a computer for everyone do you put support in for outdated tech? For ports that only serve one purpose or won’t even be used by many people? The big advantage of Thunderbolt 3 (aside from working out of box as USB ports) is that they can become anything. Want a MagSafe power port? Get a magnetic USB-C charging adapter. Want an SD card reader or 16 USB 3.0 ports? Want to attach an external desktop grade Nvidia GTX card to radically boost your graphic capabilities? These ports are really the highest aspiration of universal tech. Having to get some adapters is a small price to pay IMHO. rockdude094 I like how he said that the SD card slot is not important b/c there are great USB card readers out there.. then they proceed to remove the USB ports.. apple logic everyone mrgerbik Bah! Why not just get rid of ALL ports, completely ?? I mean, wires are so yesterday… PhoneTechJay Yes and the charging port, who needs to plug in there laptop to charge. Use it once and then get another one. malhal Typical Apple media interview, “these are the questions you are allowed to ask.” Rolf Bause Ha, real professionals (musicians, etc.) usually use USB or Thunderbolt audio interfaces… don’t get me wrong: I think it was the right thing, to keep the headphone jack, but for different reasons. Complete BS answer imo! Rolf Bause Ha, real professionals (musicians, etc.) usually use USB/Thunderbolt audio interfaces… don’t get me wrong: I think it was the right thing to keep the headphone jack (I mean, how much space does is really take anyway?), but for different reasons. Complete BS answer imo! But “pro” photographers on the other hand still massively use the SD card slot. Instead, we now have adapters for everything. Progress. Wolff That’s because “these are pro machines” and many pros use studio monitors, amps and other audio gear “that do not have wireless solutions and need the 3.5mm jack.” Cut the bullcrap! Professional studios would never ever EVER use the 3,5mm jack! They would use a USB/TB connection to preserve the digital signal or use a USB/TB DAC to bypass the, most deffinetly, poorer internal converter! JohnS LOL, you’ve visited every last studio in the world and talked to every last pro in the world have you? And it was unanimous was it? I happen to know for a fact that many pro users use the 3.5mm jack for audio depending on what the needs are, the situation demands and the type of audio editing/engineering that they are performing. It’s true that some setups (typically with external mixing boards and what not) often opt for other cabling, but your claim is certifiably not true. Wolff Ohh youre that guy.. let me take it down a notch. No I havent. Have I stated that? But unfortunatly for you you don’t know what I do for a living. Nor do I know yours. Everything would go thru a DAW with a better DAC then a macbook would ever have. Yes the 3,5 is good for headphones, and thats about it, studio wise. And if you do audio mixing using headphones, then, in my book, youre not a professional. JohnS Actually you said, “Professional studios would never ever EVER use the 3,5mm jack!” and the problem is… that statement is false. I brother in law is an audio engineer, my best friend is a composer, my brother is a musician and at my last IT job I frequently was given tickets that took me into the film and audio departments to service equipment and have seen many many many setups. I can tell you 100% that professions do use that jack in many (not all) situations. That was my only point. You can’t make the claim “never ever EVER” without absolute knowledge of the industry (which I was trying to argue, you don’t posses). And arguing that everyone who does mixing using headphones isn’t a professional isn’t fair either. In some cases this is actually essential. People who mix audio for the video game industry often times mix over headphones specifically so that they can hear “exactly” what the player will hear when they sit down in front of their computer to play the game. Wolff I do concerts as ass. sound tech as a living. 🙂 Ok, you got me on the game part. I’ll admit that. 🙂 BUT a recording studio would never ever use the analog output for anything other then a pair of headphones, since the hardware has already done one conversion of the sound. Doing it again would only worsen the quality. Not by much, and properbly not notacable go the “naked ear”. But with thousands or millions of “dollars” of equipment in a pro studio, no one would rely on the weakest link, being the dac in the mac. Yea I said professional. Ok.. Its a bit floaty.. Depends on when you call yourself professional, I guess. A Dj can easily call himself a pro, making a new world hit from his bedroom. And the mac is deffinetly up to it. I bust think the excuse Schiller gave us was a bit weak and really not thought thru. ProllyWild Are you guys forgetting it’s a laptop? No studio would ever choose the 3.5mm port as the preferred audio out, but they would use it on the go, when out of the studio. JohnS I think you’re overlooking the setting. In a live recording setup you often have a lot of expensive hardware between the audio source and the computer. In many cases it is even mixed and recorded on other hardware and only gets “backed up” in a sense to the computer. These situations would rarely use such a port but not because its a laptop, it wouldn’t use it because there would be almost no reason to bypass your hardware in a way that would let you use it. While on the go people would use it more, that’s not necessarily because it’s a laptop either, it’s because the audio has already been recorded, mixed, and encoded. At that point it just needs to be streamed back out and a headphone jack is more than capable of this. But there are plenty of people that record, edit and mix audio 100% on their computers. Even high end music production studios will often use MIDI controllers to listen to music scores to make edits and provide samples before committing to having them played and recorded by an orchestra. And in these cases a MacBook Pro is actually very adept at this kind of thing. You really don’t need a desktop to edit audio unless you are doing things that would require massive amounts of memory (which would be very very rare indeed). But when working with these setups that audio jack is perfect for listening to audio either over studio speakers or headphones. So again, I’d remind you also that saying something like “No studio would ever…” is too strong of language. If even one in the whole world does, then you’re wrong. And in this case there are lots of cases where people do all the time. I think that most of us just forget how large the audio industry is and focus on a particular branch of it when making these statements. ProllyWild Then I’ll rephrase, very few would from start to finish do all of their work via the laptop’s 3.5mm headphone jack. regardless of that fact at some point a music professional would use the 3.5mm jack to check their audio when out and about either the MacBook. I think it’s a reasonable choice to leave the jack on a computer. It being left off the iPhone for me is understandable and not really at all a major inconvenience. JohnS Oh nice that sounds like it could be a fun job! Yeah I’d agree that the reasoning Schiller used sounded a bit odd to me too. However I assume that it’s based on long talks with Dr Dre (who probably has about as good a grasp of the audio industry as anyone). It makes me wonder though how many more generations they will keep it around before it gets axed. Like you say, there are much better ways of transferring audio, so it’s only a matter of time before those options are more widely available on a larger scale of hardware choices. Arun Chaitanya Can you please quote the complete comment by Phil Schiller on the SD Card slot. The comment quoted here is not complete and cause of confusion :). While the comments on how Apple didnt think through are right, personally the biggest miss for me is the inability to connect my iphone/ipad to the latest macbooks. It is a miss of epic sizes considering the adage “It just works” does not work anymore! JohnS Honest question… why do you need to connect your phone to a computer? I’ve never once connected mine to any of my computers and I’d say the “It just works” phrase is as accurate as ever. I still do backups, I still sync photos, I still transfer files, I still charge it… Is there any reason why it ever has to be connected? Blip dude Because it is a LOT slower to upload a movie or a music library via WiFi than it would be to just simply plug it in and let it do its thing. JohnS I suppose that’s true, but I typically just stream my movies so I don’t have to take up the extra space. And if I know I’m traveling or something and want to have a few on there I just sync them up the night before and let it work while I go to bed. All in all though… faster syncing for movies though is a fairly weak reason to give up a VERY powerful port on a computer for outdated technology 😛 Arun Chaitanya Exactly my point! And Charging to the wall using lighting adapter instead of using my laptop during sync is just too stupid! ProllyWild If that’s the case, in the long run you’ll benefit more from a faster USB-c port. imvaid I am a developer. It has to be connected all the time. Now I have to get an adapter to do any kind of development on Pro machine… JohnS That’s a great point that I hadn’t considered. It makes me wonder if future models of iPhones will ship with a wall adapter to USB-C port so that the cable is more universal. Arun Chaitanya Definitely waiting for that day. And I am pretty sure world is going to be mad about it one way or the other Martynet Is it just a standard jack or does it also have an optical audio, like iMac? Leslie Bee Typical answers from a marketing exec. 100% BS. My question is, why didn’t Apple have the head of design or engineering answer such questions? Is marketing now in charge of design at Apple? That would explain a lot of their recent idiotic design decisions. Apple used to be great at innovation, but marketing’s objectives are quite different from those of engineers and designers. Marketing is interested in only three things: MONEY MONEY MONEY Marcel Herba APPLE IS FUTURE https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a7e31f0cd335a6fa9b3bc9e1a0ce138f498faa780ef1203b03ab76efff4067e4.jpg rockdude094 Yeah b/c everyone loves spending 40 dollars on a stupid thing that sticks out of your laptop lol. You know you’re a true apple fan boy when you try to turn apples negative points to positive. They aren’t perfect but their recent products are absolutely trash JohnS I’m not turning a negative into a positive. I have almost 0 need for an SD slot, I don’t need HDMI or mini display, I’m slowly upgrading my USB based devices to TB 3/USB-C anyways and I’ve been waiting for TB-3 for over a year now. From where I stand this is nothing but positive changes. What you are apparently turning a blind eye to is that not everyone has your “needs”. Not everyone needs or even wants the same ports as you, and Apple knows that. Instead of putting ports in that many people won’t use they put in 4 ports that can power anything that people need or want. This is the most universal and versatile setup that they have ever made. Apparently though since it doesn’t fit your exact vision of what’s best for you personally it’s trash? Are you honestly saying that if a port is SIGNIFICANTLY faster and more capable of meeting any need for any person for the longest period into the future it shouldn’t be included because someone might prefer older less powerful solutions? Are you really trying to say that Apple future proofing their computers and putting in much better tech is a negative? I’m kind of glad you don’t design computers for Apple 😛 websyndicate Really you don’t have use for a usb 3 port? I use my thunderbolt port for a monitor. Thunderbolt was to be the shit but it never took off like they wanted it too. Hardware was so expensive many people just went with USB3 devices. Much cheaper. Thunderbolt was SIGNIFICANT but it wasn’t practical in the market. USB 3 was. Now USB C…..Really why include a headphone port then why not usb c to audio jack. Its trash because it doesn’t fit most people day to day. How many people own macs are into multi media….a lot….how many use cameras that are stand equipped with SD card….alot I have to side with rockdude094. The count is 2 vs 1. Im an apple fanboy but this kind of does it in for me right now. If everything magically was USB C tomorrow I wouldn’t care then but its not a reality. JohnS Never said I didn’t have a use for it. I’m saying the new tech is better and that USB 3 isn’t used today as much as it was even just 2 years ago and the usage rate will continue to drop steadily. Perhaps Apple should have waited for a year, perhaps not… but the fact is, its a much better technology. The reason its so expensive at this point however is just because it doesn’t have a wide demand for it. Remember when HDMI was something new and different back in the day? Everyone was paying $50-60 for a 3foot cable? It was insanity, but the market switched and everyone had to buy cables. Today HDMI cables are super cheap! Same thing will happen with wireless components, TB cables, and more. Apple is trying to drive consumers to this market and in the long term I think this can only be a good thing. The thing is that Apple builds laptops to last. If this model shipped with USB 3 there would be less incentive for consumers to upgrade their hardware and we’d have this same conversation a few years later. At some point it has to happen. The only real question is was this the best time to do it? websyndicate I feel like Apple is losing their base. Really USB3 still heavily used and so is SD card. This is frustrating as a user that needs these ports. Like really who doesn’t have a usb need? I get it new tech but you could integrate like 1 port or 2 ports of usb C and not make life a dongle life. Just more shit to carry or Belkin to make a swiss army knife or a hub. I want to agree with apple more than anything but really has be thinner, lighter, less buttons, less everything. Minimalist to the extreme. And Phil saying the card sticks out really like a usb C to usb to SD won’t be a lot. Lord knows if you buy a usb C to SD reader it will be expensive and serve only 1 purpose.

Two weeks ago, AT&T announced its interest to purchase Time Warner for $85.4 billion, but as noted today, the regulatory process taken in such acquisitions "could last for months," and at any time another company could swoop in with a better offer. As of now, that won't be Apple. The news comes from David Faber on CNBC's market coverage business show "Squawk on the Street:" The question of course that has come back to focus on Apple. In fact Bewkes asked on the call were there any companies this year that showed interest in acquiring Time Warner. Mr. Bewkes' answer was let's focus on AT&T. What I can tell you about Apple guys, is right now, according to people familiar with its thinking, it's not interested. Apple is not interested in buying Time Warner at present. Now, these things go on for months and months, this regulatory review's going to take at least a year. The deal will not close. Certainly if you're in Apple, things could change. You watch the stock price as you see how things progress. But anybody expecting an overbid from Apple at this point, certainly, it is not coming. Again, they are sort of not interested at this time. And it doesn't appear that there would be any other potential interest. Google certainly had been mentioned at one point or another. But right now, it's AT&T's, it will be AT&T's, and the question is do they get it through, what conditions do they agree to in order to get it through the regulators. On the same day of AT&T's deal, it was reported that Apple was closely "monitoring" the workings between AT&T and Time Warner, especially due to its potential impact in regards to television deals that Apple could make with both companies. Back in January, an initial rumor suggested Apple was looking to buy Time Warner itself, most likely to bolster its rumored cord-cutting streaming TV service, but negotiations eventually stalled and the two companies ceased discussing a potential partnership. Following the news coming out of AT&T's offer, last week investment banking firm Goldman Sachs reportedly began pushing Apple to put in a rival bid to beat AT&T's and acquire Time Warner for itself. Goldman Sachs was "left on the sidelines" as an advisor in AT&T's bid, but it's still unclear why the firm would heavily encourage Apple to enter an acquisition offer of its own. Sources were reported as saying that Goldman Sachs was "freaking out trying to convince Apple to come in." A connection between the banking firm and Apple lies in the latter company's 2009 hiring of Goldman Sachs banker Adrian Perica, who now heads up Apple's mergers and acquisitions practices. Networks like CNN, HBO, TBS, TNT, NBA TV, Cartoon Network, and Warner Bros. are all under Time Warner's umbrella, making it an enticing acquisition for multiple companies looking to bolster an existing, or upcoming, streaming package. Although AT&T appears to be the frontrunner, The Wall Street Journal originally reported that "a host of other contenders" were interested in Time Warner, including Google at one point.

Peoples interactions with these brands are raising their expectations for other products and services they use  a digitally-driven phenomenon that Accenture Interactive and Fjord call liquid expectations. The award-winning Love Index, 18 months in the making, is a proprietary, first-of-its kind methodology that identified the characteristics that determine Brand Love, derived through extensive qualitative research and quantitative surveys. For its 2016 benchmark, more than 26,000 people in the U.S., U.K. and Brazil rated more than 70 brands in the auto, banking, hospitality and retail industries. Respondents also named their favorite top of mind brands, on an unaided basis.   The Love Index is a repeatable and measurable system for evaluating brand performance in any sector and in any market. It complements prevailing brand health tools such as the Net Promoter Score, which asks respondents about their likelihood to recommend a particular product or service. The Love Index takes it a step further by identifying five algorithmically-derived dimensions by which to measure customers attitudes toward their physical and digital brand experiences, resulting in a brand love score. The framework and findings can be used as a diagnostic tool to help brands design for brand love.   Our research tells us people use five characteristics  Fun, Relevant Engaging, Social and Helpful  to describe and rate their experiences with brands, says Nan Nayak, Fjords managing director of design strategy and head researcher. Weve found that many of the traits people seek in their human relationships also apply to their relationships with brands. The Love Index reveals why people love brands, and what companies can do to increase and sustain that love.   FRESH PERSPECTIVE    The shape of love is plotted in a five-dimensional space, with one point for each of the FRESH dimensions: Fun  Holds my attention in an entertaining way Relevant  Gives me clear and customized information I want, when I want it Engaging  Identifies with my individual needs and wants Social  Helps me connect with others Helpful  Is efficient, easy and adapts over time The index identified which companies set the pace for each dimension. In the U.S., Netflix is the experience leader for Fun; Fitbit for Relevant; Amazon for Helpful; Apple for Engaging; and Facebook for Social.   THE NETFLIX EFFECT Netflix is the most-loved brand across all three markets, the research reveals. Americans, Brits and Brazilians all ranked the streaming service #1 for Fun and in the top three across other dimensions. Whether they like it or not, other brands  independent of their industry  will be measured against the experience Netflix provides its customers, says Baiju Shah, global co-lead, Fjord and managing director, Accenture Interactive. This is liquid expectations fully at play.   THE SHAPE OF OPPORTUNITY   The Love Index shows that each industry, as measured by six brands (five traditional, one disrupter), has its own distinct shape reflecting what people love most.   For instance, retail brands are most loved for being Relevant, Engaging and Helpful. But the shape these scores create is informed by decades of peoples shopping experiences. A brick-and-mortar brand or start-up looking to differentiate itself could redefine the shopping experience by introducing new ways for people to connect with each other (Social) in an engaging and sustained way (Fun) -- online or in-store.   In an era of digital disruption, we expect to see brands stretch themselves across one or more dimensions to differentiate and keep pace with experience leaders, Nayak adds. These investments will lead to rising scores, creating a new shape altogether  for the individual brands or for their industry as a whole. We call the driving force behind this business revolution the shape of opportunity.   Please visit accenture.com/loveindex2016 for additional findings, methodology, or to learn how Accenture Interactive and Fjord can help companies increase their brand affinity.   About Accenture Accenture (NYSE: ACN) is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions in strategy, consulting, digital, technology and operations.

So where do they dream of landing for their next job? It turns out that many people are focusing their job hunt on a diverse group of companies that, despite their differences, tend to share certain traits, such as a strong brand and the sense of purpose employees derive from working there.  5 big mistakes job seekers make That’s according to a new study from career site Indeed.com, which surveyed which companies among the Fortune 500 had the highest “click-through” rates on their online job ads. While the list names some of the usual suspects -- such as Apple (AAPL), the most valuable company in the world, as well as the most valuable global brand -- it also includes several older companies with roots in the industrial era, such as railway Norfolk Southern. Job seekers are also searching for a variety of jobs, from entry-level positions that don’t require college degrees to more highly skilled roles such as software engineers. “They are very different companies, ranging from an insurance company to an internet company to travel companies,” said Paul Wolfe, head of HR for Indeed.com, “What’s important is that they have a compelling story that they are telling about their company, the culture of the company, how people are treated and what current employees think.” Play Video Home Hints on acing the job interview process Even though the economy is slowly improving, millions of Americans are still out of work. The interview process can be tough, for both job-seeker... Surprisingly, the most popular open positions at tech companies such as Apple and Amazon.com (AMZN) aren’t all tech-related posts. At Apple, the most popular job ads included receptionist, while one of Amazon’s most popular opening was for warehouse workers. “It shows the spectrum of jobs” that companies like Apple and Amazon are seeking to fill, Wolfe said, as well as the wide range of skills that Americans possess. Only one of three Americans holds a college degree, which is necessary for higher-paying, professional occupations such as engineering.

Thunderbolt 2 Dock to the rescue While new MacBook Pro buyers are bemoaning the lack of ports, classic owners still have to manage all those cables somehow. This article shows one nicely engineered solution. By David Gewirtz for DIY-IT | November 2, 2016 -- 14:15 GMT (07:15 PDT) | Topic: Hardware From five connections down to two. "Honnnneeey...!" My wife has the ability to imbue the word "honey" with many meanings. This particular tone indicated that she was frustrated with something, and it was time for me to put on my official Husband Problem-Solving Hat. It's like a Sorting Hat, but with wires, not magic. She, her desk, and my former MacBook Pro were not getting along. Last spring, my wife adopted my 2015 MacBook Pro as a replacement for her desktop computer. I traded my cherished MacBook Pro for her trusty Mac mini, which I immediately put to use on a another project. My plan was to order the new hotness notebook as soon as Apple announced it. Apple finally did, and I'm waiting for one of the new Touch Bar MBPs to arrive. She got a much faster Mac out of the deal, but she also got hit with some unexpected inconvenience. When at her desk, she has been using most of the MacBook Pro's available ports. She had one of the two Thunderbolt ports dedicated to a hardwired Ethernet connection. She had the HDMI port going through a DVI adaptor to a Monoprice 27-inch monitor. She had one of the two USB ports connected to a bulk document scanner, and the other USB port connected to a USB hub (which contained her unified wireless keyboard and mouse dongle and a whole bunch of other things because she likes to use a lot of gear at her desk). That array of port usage was no big thing when she had a dedicated computer at her desk. But once she started to use the MacBook Pro, it no longer just sat on her desk. It became her constant companion, her little silver buddy. Urban Armor's rugged case. Out and about, it was fine. She uses the Urban Armor Gear ICE Mil-spec protected case on it. Urban Armor sent me one of their cases last year. As soon as she adopted my MacBook Pro, she snagged the case. She said she was "over the moon" about it because it's cool looking, rugged, and you can see the Apple logo through its smoke grey cover. It's kept the laptop safe during her travels. The problem was occurring when my wife got back to her desk. Settling into work at her desk was no longer a matter of turning on her monitor and going to work. She had to set up the MacBook Pro, find all the loose cables, connect the MagSafe 2 adapter, the Thunderbolt-based Ethernet adapter, the monitor, and all the USB devices. Every time she had to leave her desk, she had to go through the reverse process, removing the MagSafe plug, the Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter, the monitor, and all the USB devices. Cables would sometimes fall off the edge of the desk and get lost on the floor, or attacked by the puppy. It doesn't seem like a big deal, but it added friction to her workday. The result was that she would sometimes work at her desk without the peripherals that help her do her job most efficiently. Sometimes if everything was finally hooked up right, she'd find herself avoiding bringing her Mac with her. She was doing without her laptop when she went out, missing opportunities to get work done away from the home office, because it was just too much of a pain. Yes, this is a First World problem. But she's a busy person with modern stresses and demands on her time. Every added set of steps adds to her long list of to do items. Sitting down at her desk required finding five wires and making five connections. Getting up from her desk, and taking her computer, required removing five connections. Yes, she was psyched to have a newer, faster, more useful machine she could take with her everywhere. But trying to make it also work as her main desktop computer wound up adding ten additional steps to every desk session. So her happiness about the benefits started to diminish rapidly. This is where "Honnnneeey...!" came into the picture. "Can you please fix it?" OWC's Thunderbolt 2 Dock As it turns out, I already had what I thought might be a solution. The nice folks at Other World Computing had sent me an OWC Thunderbolt 2 Dock, which I had originally intended to use in one of my studio projects. With the studio project went on hold because both software products I was testing and planned on relying upon failed, my look at the Thunderbolt 2 Dock went on hold as well. Both software companies assure me they're preparing upgrades that fix their deal-killing problems. In the meantime, the Thunderbolt 2 Dock sat woefully in its box in my review cabinet, awaiting adoption by a loving desk and a kindly computer. When my wife called a "Fix it!" - her most urgent and plaintive version of the honey-do, I immediately remembered the Thunderbolt dock. I pulled it out of the cabinet, headed over to her desk, and handed it to my wife. The dock has ports on the back and the side. I did a search online, and discovered that no software or drivers are needed for the dock. You plug it in. You plug your stuff into it. She looked at it warily for a minute, shrugged, then started to plug in her ports and set up her desktop. There were two issues. First, to connect to her computer, she still needs to connect two cables: Thunderbolt and power. Even so, that got her down to four connections per connect/disconnect cycle from ten. Still a win. The second issue was more difficult to solve. The monitor (which has a DVI connection) didn't work properly in the dock's HDMI port. With the DVI-to-HDMI adapter she was using, it flashed and flickered. At first, we thought our slick plan would be foiled right there. This monitor was one I had tried on my four-monitor iMac project and given up on. It worked well as a main monitor, but it was a very inexpensive 27-inch monitor. It was fussy. It was also fussy on the Thunderbolt dock. As it turns out, we were able to fix the problem. I first tried a pile of HDMI to DVI adapters and they all failed pretty much the same way. I then dug out my one spare Thunderbolt to DVI adapter, and that worked. Perfectly. I honestly can't be completely sure whether the problem with the monitor resided in the monitor itself, in the adapter, or in the HDMI connection through the dock. But I can tell you that using the Thunderbolt adapter works reliably, AND I've had problems with this monitor before. So I'd be willing to bet that the problem resides in the monitor. A network switch, USB hub, and the new Thunderbolt 2 Dock. The side ports (not shown) are being used first, leaving room for lots of expansion. What does my wife think about the Thunderbolt 2 Dock as a solution? "It's fantastic. I don't have to rummage around my desk for wires all the time. It just works." At $249, the Thunderbolt 2 Dock isn't cheap. But what price do you put on moving honey-do to honey-done, not to mention an increase in productivity, as well as improved utilization of an expensive piece of computing equipment? If this is something you need, you'll know if the expense is worth it. Now, what about the new Touch Bar, USB-C, Thunderbolt 3-only MacBook Pro? Stay tuned. When mine arrives, I'll look at how to hook that little beast into the studio with its own special dock. You can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

In the middle of his Seattle concert on Oct. 19, Ye went on a full-on rant about Jay Z’s ‘bulls**t’ between Tidal and Apple, blaming Jay for destroying the chance for a second ‘Watch The Throne’ album. Watch a video of his rant right here! The fire ignited when Kanye was introducing his line from Drake‘s song “Pop Style,” which was supposed to feature The Throne (Kanye and Jay Z together). But because of the competition, Tidal — and now Kanye is seemingly too bitter to work with Jay again. “There will never be a Watch The Throne 2, you know why? Because that’s why I wasn’t on this song,” Kanye told the crowd. “I wasn’t on this song ’cause of Hov. ‘Cause of this Tidal-Apple bulls**t. And this s**t be getting me tight every time I perform this motherf****r. That y’all didn’t get what y’all were supposed to get with me and Drake on this song ’cause of some Tidal – Apple bulls**t.” Tidal and Apple have had an ongoing battle because of their streaming services, fighting for subscribers in their own race to catch up to music streaming conglomerate Spotify. Since Jay Z owns Tidal, obviously he wouldn’t want to do anything with Apple that would put his own company in jeopardy. In Ye’s words, “it’s some political s**t, some s**t about percentages on songs,” which unfortunately jeopardizes some music projects like The Throne. Before you side with Kanye, though, there’s an interesting point that needs to be addressed. Yes, Jay Z’s decision to not be on “Pop Style” was ultimately a Tidal vs. Apple thing, but a lot of it had to do with the fact that Meek Mill is signed with Jay Z’s Roc Nation management company and Drake is heavily involved with Apple. Jay couldn’t make it seem like he was on Team Drake in the Drake/Meek feud! Considering Meek has no association with The Throne, maybe this means that Watch The Throne 2 can happen after all?! Kanye doesn’t seem to be into it anymore, but we’ll definitely keep holding out hope! HollywoodLifers, do you agree with Kanye’s rant about Jay Z? Do you think the disses will keep coming?

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Extra storage just got cheaper for older Macs Up to $100 off extra storage on MacBook Airs, Mac Minis, and more. by Valentina Palladino - Nov 2, 2016 2:17 pm UTC Login to bookmark 41 Enlarge Andrew Cunningham Just after Apple proudly debuted its newest MacBook Pros, the company quietly lowered the prices of high-capacity storage upgrades for older Mac products on its website. Reports show that anyone purchasing a MacBook Air, iMac, Mac Pro, Mac Mini, and the old MacBook Pro will save up to $100 if they get the 512GB or 1TB options. Getting extra storage used to add $300 to $400 (512GB) or even $700 to $900 (1TB) to the cost of the device, but for these older models, Apple appears to have shaved off some of the price. For example, upgrading the 256GB 13-inch MacBook Air to 512GB of SSD PCIe-based flash storage costs $200 now, instead of $300. For the base model of the 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display, it now costs $400 to upgrade to 512GB of flash storage, which is $100 less than earlier this year. Apple is still selling the 2015 13- and 15-inch models of the MacBook Pro. The 15-inch model that comes with 256GB of storage can be upgraded to 512GB for $200 and 1TB for $600, down from $300 and $800, respectively. Those are actually the same prices for the same upgrades to the new 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, only the new model also has a 2TB upgrade option for an additional $1,400. The 2015 13-inch MacBook Pro is a bit trickier, since it comes standard with just 128GB of SSD: it can be upgraded to 256GB for $200, 512GB for $400, and 1TB for $800. Apple only updated the MacBook Pro at its most recent event at the end of last month, much to the dismay of fans who were hoping for other new Macs. While it wasn't a surprise to see such a big update to the MacBook Pros, it was a bit surprising that Apple didn't update any of the other Macs. That makes it a couple of years since some Macs have seen any kind of update, and the future of some of those products—namely the MacBook Air—is uncertain at best. It's also worth noting that the actual starting prices of all these older Macs have not changed—the price cut has only affected the additional costs of extra storage.

 A new Apple patent shows it's exploring the idea of foldable iPhones Hannah Roberts Nov. 2, 2016, 9:44 AM 786 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple illustrates a laptop computer or another flexible device which bends along a flexible seam in the patent.United States Patent and Trademark Office Apple has been awarded a new patent which shows a foldable iPhone concept, Patently Apple has reported. Apple has been working on a foldable electronic device concept since at least 2013, when it filed a patent application that "generally related to electronic devices that may have portions that are capable of being flexed," Patently Apple reported at the time.   But this patent talks about an improved structure using specific materials that could make a bunch of electronic devices — including phones, laptops, wrist-watch devices, and tablets — resistant to cracking when completely bent along a hinge. Specifically it introduces the use of carbon nanotubes, which nanoscience.com says are "tube-shaped material, made of carbon ... unique because the bonding between the atoms is very strong." And they can be used to form "carbon nanotube signal paths," the patent says, which are flexible and therefore resistant to cracking when bent. A cross-sectional side view of an illustrative electronic device is shown in the patent.US patent and trademark office It's important to note that Apple files patents regularly and this does not mean it will launch foldable hardware in the future. The images it uses in its patent applications are merely illustrative.  Earlier this year, Business Insider published a list of some of the most interesting Apple patents from the past year — including magnetically detachable earbuds, a phone with an edge-to-edge wrap-around display, and a new kind of laptop keyboard in which the keys don't actually move, but rather sense that you press down.

After all, it's been well over a year since Apple released a new MacBook, and the best it could do was to add a Touch Bar and erase all of the standard ports? But despite the laptop's well-documented issues, reviewers are finding a lot to love with Apple's latest MacBook Pros. In fact, with reviews of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with function keys beginning to pop up around the internet, we struggled to find any reviews that backed up the initial negative reaction online. DON'T MISS: Does the iPhone 7 have any competition right now? Read on for a roundup of 13-inch MacBook Pro reviews: The Verge The Verge published one of the more complimentary reviews of the 13-inch MacBook Pro, calling it "the professionalization of the 12-inch MacBook." "Any doubts about why this new MacBook Pro exists while being so similar to the MacBook should really be extinguished by its performance. The Pro has a much more powerful processor and smoother graphics to go along with a significantly improved keyboard and a titanic trackpad. The MacBook is still the better computer to take on a flight with you, but the MacBook Pro approaches its level of portability while offering vastly more power and a longer-lasting battery." Read the full review. Ars Technica While Ars Technica understands the complaints about the new MacBook Pro line and offers some sympathy, the site also admits that the new 13-inch MacBook Pro, even with function keys as opposed to the Touch Bar, is a solid update: "Putting aside larger concerns about Apple’s stewardship of the Mac as a hardware and software platform, the new MacBook Pro is a very solid design that should serve Apple well over the next few years. Some pros will claim that it isn’t “pro” enough, but the 13-inch models have always served as more of a bridge between the consumer MacBooks and MacBook Airs on the low end and the 15-inch Pros and the desktop lineup on the high end. They've never been particularly "pro."" Read the full review. PC Magazine PC Magazine also found a lot to love, but with a few important caveats: "If you're looking for a new laptop for multimedia work, it should be on your short list, yes. But if you have a lot of legacy peripherals, we can't help but think that you're probably better off with a system with more versatile connectivity, like the Dell XPS 13 Touch, our Editors' Choice for high-end ultraportable laptops. If you don't want to make the move to Windows, however, last year's 13-inch MacBook Air and MacBook Pro are still available at their 2015 prices; you'll just have to scroll a little further down on Apple's website to find them." Read the full review. Mashable Mashable, on the other hand, had no issue recommending the new laptop: "Overall, the entry-level 13-inch MacBook is a satisfying and still sexy system with myriad improvements, but no signature innovation. It should attract budget-conscious MacBook Pro users (those who aren't willing to switch to Windows where they can get a similarly appointed system for under $900) who think $1,799 is too much for a Core i5 MacBook Pro, even if it does feature that unusual new Touch Bar." Read the full review. Laptop Mag Finally, Laptop Mag backs up all the other reviews — at the end of the day, the new MacBook Pro is simply a great laptop, despite its port problem: "The 13-inch MacBook Pro improves upon its predecessor in nearly every way. It's faster, lighter and more compact, and it offers a brighter display and considerably longer battery life than most Windows machines. I also like the rich and powerful stereo speakers. However, while I'm glad Apple included 2 fast Thunderbolt 3 ports, I wish it kept a traditional USB 3.0 port around for charging the iPhone and connecting other peripherals, as well as an SD card slot."

Comments Computerworld | Nov 2, 2016 6:47 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Apple Mac Computer Hardware MacOS Apple MacBook Pro Comments Apple VP worldwide marketing, Phil Schiller, spoke exclusively to The Independent this week, taking the chance to offer the commitment pro users need if they are wondering about the fate of the desktop Mac: Love the Mac "We love the Mac and are as committed to it, in both desktops and notebooks, as we ever have been," he said. Given Schiller made this statement yesterday it makes sense to see this as an attempt to offer a little reassurance to pro users who remain disappointed at the lack of news about Mac Pro, iMac or Mac mini models at last week’s MacBook Pro launch. Schiller admitted the level of criticism the company has seen with this release “surprised” him. “We know we made good decisions about what to build into the new MacBook Pro and that the result is the best notebook ever made,” he said. Despite the critics, Schiller points out that customers seem to agree with Apple, it turns out the company has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before, he said. Courage and pride He’s proud of the product, too, pouring praise on Apple’s engineering and product design teams, “It took a level of engineering not possible before,” he said, referring (I presume) to design features like the internal hooks which keep the chassis together while also keeping it solid. “The level of engineering it takes to make this the way it is, is a tremendous technical challenge compared to the past,” he said. Apple introduced its new MacBook Pro models at a special event last week. The “Hello Again” event coincided with the 25th anniversary of the world’s first mobile Mac. The company used the event to articulate a vision in which nuanced touch becomes part of the UI, in the form of the much-discussed Touch Bar. Change management Schiller also seems to accept that some of the decisions the company has made, such putting touch inside its pro notebook, adopting USB-C, and design limitations such as the 16GB RAM limit, mean the company needs to give a little guidance to users, "We care about what they love and what they are worried about. And it's our job to help people through these changes," he said. Schiller also said the Mac experience is now “dominated” by Apple’s notebooks, but his promise that Apple cares about both desktop and notebook Macs suggests the company will have news to share with desktop users soon. He also said that the company has no plans to merge the iOS and macOS platforms, but to make them into harmonious but different companions. Given that speculation had favored introduction of new desktops at last week’s event, some online Apple watchers have speculated that current processor supplier, Intel, delayed the company’s plans. Echoes If true that reflects a terrible echo from the days of the AIM Alliance, when Apple once again found its intentions for its platform curtailed by the limitations of its processor supply partners. This may also inform any future intentions the company may harbor for processor development and supply. Meanwhile, it seems, Mac Pro, iMac and (hopefully) Mac mini users can look forward to improvements to their chosen form factors relatively soon. Google+?

Linux Tests Of The New 2016 MacBook Pro With Touchbar Are Coming Written by Michael Larabel in Hardware on 2 November 2016 at 09:43 AM EDT. 20 Comments Just in case anyone is thinking about the new (late-2016) MacBook Pro recently announced by Apple, I found out this morning we'll be receiving one for Phoronix Test Suite Linux benchmarking in the next week or two and should be interesting to see how this (expensive/over-priced) modern laptop runs with Linux. Apple announced the new MacBook Pro last week with a new multi-touch enabled Touch Bar, only USB-C / Thunderbolt 2 ports for connectivity, up to a 10 hour battery life, and much faster performance over older MacBook Pro laptops. Those wanting to learn more can visit Apple.com. Aside from the performance, it will be interesting to see how well the MacBook Pro is working with late-2016 Linux distributions like Ubuntu 16.10 and Fedora 25... Given the Thunderbolt 2, a new touchpad, Apple's new "Touch Bar", etc, it could be quite a headache-inducing process getting the laptop running with the current Linux distributions but we'll know more soon enough. Almost certainly the Touch Bar won't be of any use under Linux until someone does some reverse-engineering and development, but hopefully at least the touch pad and other basic functionality will be working. So stay tuned if you're at all curious about the 2016 MacBook Pro on Linux. It looks like the model we'll be receiving is the 15.4-inch MacBook Pro with 2.6GHz Core i7 Skylake CPU, 16GB of DDR4-2133MHz memory, 256GB PCI-E SSD, 2880 x 1800 retina display, and AMD Radeon Pro 450 Polaris graphics. Of course with the Phoronix Test Suite working on macOS Sierra too, there will be Linux vs. macOS benchmarks from this MBP too -- if you missed my tests from September on older hardware: macOS 10.12 Sierra vs. Ubuntu 16.04 Linux Benchmarks and FreeBSD 11.0 Comes Up Short In Ubuntu 16.04 vs. macOS Sierra Benchmarks. 20 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Given that USB-C is indeed the future standard we can look forward to, this was to be expected, although admittedly many don’t seem to be too pleased about it. However Apple also removed the SD card slot, something that has caused a bit of controversy especially amongst professionals who use the slot to quickly transfer over photos and videos. So why did Apple remove the SD card slot but keep the 3.5mm headphone jack? According to Phil Schiller who spoke to The Independent, this is why: “Because of a couple of things. One, it’s a bit of a cumbersome slot. You’ve got this thing sticking halfway out. Then there are very fine and fast USB card readers, and then you can use CompactFlash as well as SD. So we could never really resolve this – we picked SD because more consumer cameras have SD but you can only pick one.” Schiller also adds that because of the rise in wireless transfer technology in cameras, the slot isn’t as needed as it once was. We know that you could always purchase a third-party card reader, but that’s just more devices you’ll have to bring around, and additional expenses, but what do you guys think? Is that a valid argument? Filed in Apple >Computers. Read more about laptops and Macbook Pro.

Speaking to The Independent, Apple exec Phil Schiller said the company had dropped the SD card slot as it was "cumbersome" and because wireless transfer technology for cameras is "proving very useful" as an alternative. A lot of photographers, though, would disagree with this. Although wireless tethering is certainly getting better, it’s frequently buggy and still slower than using an SD card to get photos from to your computer. In a professional situation where speed and reliability count, it’s not a viable alternative, which is why people will be forced to use a dongle instead. Here's Schiller’s full answer on why the SD card slot was dropped: Because of a couple of things. One, it’s a bit of a cumbersome slot. You've got this thing sticking halfway out. Then there are very fine and fast USB card readers, and then you can use CompactFlash as well as SD. So we could never really resolve this – we picked SD because more consumer cameras have SD but you can only pick one. So, that was a bit of a trade-off. And then more and more cameras are starting to build wireless transfer into the camera. That’s proving very useful. So we think there’s a path forward where you can use a physical adaptor if you want, or do wireless transfer. When asked if it’s "inconsistent" for the MacBook Pro to retain the traditional headphone jack (another widely-used connector that Apple has dropped from the iPhone) Schiller says that professionals still need that on a laptop for other types of audio gear that doesn't work wirelessly. "If it was just about headphones then it doesn’t need to be there, we believe that wireless is a great solution for headphones," he says. In a follow-up interview a day later, Schiller also notes that there has been "a lot of passionate dialogue and debate about the new MacBook Pro." He adds that he’s been surprised by the criticism, but says the decision to only use Thunderbolt ports was a "bold risk" and Apple will "help people through these changes."

Additionally, Apple is said to be focusing its automotive initiative on building a software-based autonomous driving system. All of Apple’s past successes were related to human-machine interfaces, such as mouse for Mac, click wheel for iPod, and multi-touch for iPhone and iPad. Assuming Apple successfully develops AR, we predict the firm will enjoy the following competitive advantages: (1) redefining existing key products and leading competitors by three to five years. For instance, this could happen for iPhone, iPad and Mac; (2) eliminating obstacles of Apple Watch and Apple TV by offering an innovative user experience; and (3) entering new business fields, such as autonomous driving system. We expect Apple to generate preliminary results for AR in the next 1-2 years at the earliest and working with iPhone may be the first step. Notably, this lines up with a recent report from Robert Scoble which predicted a huge shift for the company towards mixed reality and likened Apple's entry to this world to IBM's entry to personal computing. Kuo believes the AR and VR markets will grow from a combined $40-50 billion in 2018 to $150 billion in 2020, with most of the increase coming from AR.

There are some awesome new technologies at play here, and yes, while there are issues with some of the omissions especially power users there are things in these machines which are sure to delight users. Super-fast IO The biggest pet peeve that most people have is that Apple has dunked the USB 2.0 ports. Well, that’s a bummer indeed, but the entire industry is moving towards USB Type C. By the end of 2017 you’d imagine it to become more or less of a de facto standard when it comes to I/O. But more than this, the new MacBook Pro models come with the latest generation of Thunderbolt ports which has transfer speeds of up to 40 Gbps and USB 3.1 speeds of up to 10 GBps. That’s some serious firepower and once USB Type C is more prevalent you will not have any issues. If you are a pro user and have thunderbolt based hardware, then these are the machines you’d want to own. And most people who use these machines wouldn’t mind adding a dongle to their workflow for the interim for the extra horsepower. No MagSafe The lack of mag-safe isn’t a disadvantage, it is boon. Apple’s proprietary connector over the years had become bit of a Hindenburg. Often we would learn of cases where either the user has ended up with a failed power cable or in some extreme cases the mag-safe connector has failed which is fused to the motherboard. I myself have gone through two instances of the mag-safe connector failing on my MacBook Pro and I’ve had to get the entire logic board replace which I assure isn’t cheap. As the new MacBook Pro can draw power from either of the four USB Type C connectors, you have multiple fail-safes built in even if one fails. This is just brilliant. The largest trackpad on a notebook Often people complain about the lack of touch on a MacBook and my question to them is ‘Do you even use the touch screen?’ Often the answer is a no. Apple’s force touch trackpads are basically the best trackpads that you can get on a notebook because it mimics the feel of a touchscreen better than most touchscreens themselves. The gestures work fluidly on a Mac and you’d never find yourself looking for a mouse because it is so good. With the new MacBook Pro, you get a trackpad which is now twice as big. A larger trackpad is a larger canvas for your gestures and what not. It is one of the best ways to multitask on a laptop apart from the keyboard, which means that Apple has essentially made the MacBook Pro more usable. The fastest SSD ever Some of the early benchmarks of the MacBook Pro 13-inch model have proven that Apple has outfitted it with the fastest SSD ever installed on a laptop. The new models have a sequential read speeds of 3.1 gigabytes per second and write speeds of 2.2 gigabytes per second. Apple Insider has a test in which it even shows that the base model 13-inch MacBook Pro is almost twice as fast as the recently released Dell XPS 13 model. So while, you may get an older Skylake processor and the RAM being capped to 16GB, the SSD performance is a big deal. You can ask long time Mac users that how bigger difference an upgraded SSD makes to the real world performance of the machine, and that’s what Apple has seemingly achieved. Fewer cables With Apple hedging its bets fully on USB Type C, the big deal will be that sooner or later you will be carrying fewer cables. For example, if you are an owner of a fairly new Android phone, then chances are your phone is already using USB Type C, which means that even in the case of the Macs you will be using a similar cable. Right now, the paradigm involves the big mag-safe connector, USB 2.0 cables and USB Type C to USB 2.0 cables. All this will be over, and we will be in a much simpler world. And if there’s a company that’s all about simplicity, then it is Apple. Touch Bar Apple’s obsession with the removal of hardware keys stems from the obsessive nature of its founder – Steve Jobs. The Touch Bar gets rid of the rarely used function row and adds dynamic interface elements right on the keyboard and the idea on paper isn’t too bad. It is only that Apple botched up the way it showcased the utility of the feature because it looks quite functional and it is something that no other notebook has. Touch ID One of the biggest new features of the new MacBook Pro is the addition of Touch ID. Now, there have been fingerprint scanners before on notebooks, but Apple’s approach to security is quite extreme. Apple has added a new T1 chip which is derivative of the S2 processor on the Apple Watch married with the secure enclave on the A series of processors which basically make sure that all the biometric data is on the device itself and not on the cloud making the MacBook Pro one of the most secure machines around. I am talking about insane security levels considering even the FBI has struggled to break into Apple’s processors. If this isn’t a ‘Pro’ feature, then I don’t know what’s a pro feature. Nicer screens with DCI-P3 support Apple has become a proponent of wide colour and DCI-P3 colour formats, the new MacBook Pro models have 67 percent better contrast ratio, their brightness levels go up to 500 nits and they have 25 percent more colours. These are some of the nicest screens you will find on a laptop period. It is not always about the amount of pixels a screen packs and yet, the MacBook Pro has been packing ample for the last few years, so I can’t understand why people are whining.

Patently Apple uncovered the new patent that Apple applied for three years ago. The publication theorizes that Apple kept the patent hidden from discovery by lodging the application under the name of the individual designers rather than the usual habit of lodging the patent application under the Apple name. Sketches in the patent application show an iPhone with a fold down the middle of the screen, with carbon nanotubes giving strength to the structure.

Apple is granted about 2000 patents a year, and just because it patents something it does not mean that it will result in a product. But chief design officer Jony Ive gave an insight into the time involved in going from an idea to implementation last week in an interview with CNET about the new MacBook Pro Touch Bar, saying the design of the Touch Bar came after two years of trying a range of designs. Apple is expected to majorly revamp the iPhone design next year, although if it does develop a foldable iPhone that is likely to be something several years down the line.

There is no Time Warner bid coming from Apple at this point, sources said, although the regulatory process could last for months, and things could change. Shares of Apple's were up half a percent in morning trading, while AT&T and Time Warner shares were little changed. AT&T agreed less than two weeks ago to buy Time Warner for more than $85 billion, a blockbuster deal that could face regulatory scrutiny. The Wall Street Journal reported late last month that Apple had approached Time Warner about a combination a few months ago, but the discussions were only preliminary and didn't move forward. Kena Betancur | AFP | Getty Images Pedestrians walk past the Time Warner Inc. Center in New York on October 23, 2016. The deal would give Time Warner properties— including Harry Potter, Batman, Superman and CNN — a direct distribution platform to AT&T's wireless customers. But politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump have questioned whether the combined company would have too much concentrated power over the media. "Combining with AT&T is the natural next step in the evolution of our business and allows us to significantly accelerate our most important strategies," Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said in a statement Wednesday, after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue. Apple CEO Tim Cook and executive Eddy Cue had previously expressed interest in including Time Warner's cable channels in a future Apple video streaming service, according to the Financial Times. In an earnings report last week, Cook said that owning and creating content was a good opportunity for Apple, and one the iPhone maker is focused on.

November 2 AAPL: 111.59 0.10 Apple will get 3-5 year lead in augmented reality; use it for autonomous driving – KGI Ben Lovejoy - 2 weeks ago @benlovejoy Apple Car Augmented reality View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit A rather speculative KGI note suggests that Apple’s focus on augmented reality (AR) instead of virtual reality (VR) will give the company a 3-5 year lead on the rest of the industry when it launches its first products. The report also suggests that Apple could use augmented reality as part of an autonomous driving system. All of Apple’s past successes were related to human-machine interfaces, such as mouse for Mac, click wheel for iPod, and multi-touch for iPhone and iPad. Assuming Apple successfully develops AR, we predict the firm will enjoy the following competitive advantages: (1) redefining existing key products and leading competitors by three to five years. For instance, this could happen for iPhone, iPad and Mac; (2) eliminating obstacles of Apple Watch and Apple TV by offering an innovative user experience; and (3) entering new business fields, such as autonomous driving system. KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo doesn’t, though, expect Apple to launch its first AR product any time soon … He believes that Apple will initially focus on adding AR capabilities to the iPhone, and doesn’t expect anything to hit the market in less than 1-2 years. Tim Cook has on several occasions made clear that the company is more interested in AR than VR, and the company has made a number of hires and has been filing patents in this area over many years. However, the specifics of the note, and most especially the link to autonomous driving, seem well into the realm of speculation. KGI tends to be a fairly reliable guide to product plans based on supply chain sources, but such sources are not likely to have any information 1-2 years before a first launch. The analyst’s estimates of the total value of the market are more credible, with the combined AR and VR markets estimated to grow from US$40-50bn in 2018 to US$150bn in 2020. KGI believes that AR will ultimately turn out to be the more valuable technology, so an early Apple lead here could lead to significant revenues. Things have gone rather quiet on the Apple Car front, the most recent report suggesting that Apple has abandoned plans to develop an electric car, instead focusing on an autonomous driving platform that would be offered to car manufacturers.

As the mobile platform shift accelerates from smartphones to homes, cars and virtual environments, traditional customer communication methods are becoming irrelevant. With today's announcement, Urban Airship extends its role as the global leader in mobile engagement, making it easy for developers and marketers to coordinate lightweight, action-oriented notifications integrated into any experience along the customer journey. The first actualization of Urban Airship's open channels approach is third-party support for Apple News notifications. Apple News publishing partners can now use the visual message composer within Urban Airship Engage to create and deliver notifications to Apple News users that have opted in to their channel. As more than half of the top 30 global media owners already use Urban Airship for their own apps, the goal is to make it easier for publishers to grow channel engagement in Apple News using a familiar notification workflow. Other new advancements include support for web notifications, delivery to users' preferred and active channels and machine learning to predict app users likely to churn. Collectively, these capabilities enable businesses to reach more customers in more places at their moment of need, sustaining interactions and creating valuable feedback loops that drive growth. "In the scramble for customer attention and loyalty, only firms delivering the best customer experiences will win... that means supporting all experiences relevant and personal-tailored individually for each customer and in real-time. The payoff of using all the data to do so is significant: higher revenues" (Forrester Research, Inc., Digital Insights Will Power Great Digital Experiences, 11/25/15). With Urban Airship's Open Channels, businesses no longer need to integrate their software with numerous messaging channels or build orchestration logic from scratch in order to reach customers with rich notification-style messaging on any platform or channel -- from chat messaging services and email, to smart home devices and in-car information systems. Urban Airship's Open Profiles extends the company's open mobile data strategy and further breaks down customer data silos, by collecting and processing real-time customer behavior, events and attributes from any system or channel. This data enriches user profiles for real-time automation and messaging orchestration, and is also available in Urban Airship Insight to analyze customer patterns across multi-device, multi-touchpoint journeys, or for real-time streaming through Urban Airship Connect to populate data warehouses and trigger user-level actions in other systems. "Experts predict that the next 10 years will generate an order of magnitude more change than we have seen in the last 10 years," relayed Brett Caine, CEO and president of Urban Airship. "With this velocity of change, a closed marketing cloud simply can't keep up with the pace of business and customer demands. We're opening up our platform to address the growing complexity and expanding opportunity for businesses to individually interact with customers wherever they are. Customers will demand it, and our Mobile Growth Platform will help businesses achieve it." Combined, Open Channels and Open Profiles will unleash the ability to both learn and act on what customers care about most, capturing customer interactions in notification experiences everywhere in real-time. A few use cases include: Using point of sale data from physical stores to send receipts, warranty information and accessory upsells to users' preferred channel. Infusing emails and messaging app interactions with rich notifications that proactively address users' behaviors in other channels. Reminding users on their preferred or active channel of items left in shopping carts and wish lists, or coupons that are about to expire. Sending an in-car notification to alert homeowners they left the front door open or unlocked. Sending grocery shopping reminders to a refrigerator screen or delivering a more urgent message to active channels if power to the refrigerator goes out. The Sacramento Kings are at the forefront of using this technology to revolutionize the fan experience across major league sports. Their new, state-of-the-art arena, Golden 1 Center, is the most technologically advanced arena in the world -- fans attending Kings games or taking in a concert can use the Kings app to find a parking spot, use the most advanced cell phone technology to send a Snapchat, or control the temperature of their section through the team's app, among other features. "Golden 1 Center delivers hyper-personalized, real-time information and customer service experiences through our revolutionary app," said Ryan Montoya, Chief Technology Officer, Sacramento Kings. "We have built the world's most advanced arena, and a huge part of that, is the instantaneous use of data from multiple platforms that make guests' experiences truly exceptional." Availability All of these services and solutions are available in beta this quarter with general availability in Q1. Businesses and technology partners interested in taking advantage of these new services can contact Urban Airship here.

Tuesday, 15 November 2016 Latest News People Moves Fintech Web's Best finews.first finews.ch About Search Apple Pay Arrival Unseats Swiss Competition Details Thursday, 7 July 2016 14:08 Print    As first reported exclusively by finews.ch, Apple is introducing its payment app, Apple Pay, in Switzerland. The IT giant from California is well-placed to dominate the market as other payment services struggle to compete. Apple Set to Launch Swiss Payment System Twint: Switzerland's Answer to Apple Pay The worst nightmare of Swiss banks has become a reality: starting Thursday, a heavyweight outsider begins offering a payment service in their home market. Apple has brought its payment app, Apple Pay, to Switzerland. In June, finews.ch reported the imminent launch of Apple Pay in Switzerland. The introduction of the service is now being announced by Apple Pay’s partners in Switzerland, for example the kiosk operator Valora. Also on board from the financial world are the Ticino Corner Bank with the Cornercard, as well as the credit card operators Visa, Mastercard and Swiss Bankers. NFC chip as a lever  Apple Pay’s main local competitor, the payment app Twint, which is backed by banks like UBS, Credit Suisse, Zuercher Kantonalbank, Postfinance and Raiffeisen, as well as the retail giants Coop and Migros, will only be available in its new form in the autumn. Twint faces another significant disadvantage against Apple Pay: Apple blocks NFC (Near Field Communication) technology in its smartphones for other payment operators. With a 50 per cent share of the smartphone market, that is a serious obstacle. It was already enough to cause the Swisscom payment app Tapit to fail. In the meantime, Apple Pay can connect with the payment terminals of most Swiss retailers. The Bluetooth technology, which Twint relies on, is not yet widely used in stores. Consumer protection concerns The first resistance to Apple’s power play has emerged. The «Neue Zuercher Zeitung» newspaper has reported that the Consumer Protection Association (SKS) has made a complaint against Apple with the Swiss Competition Authority (Weko) on the grounds that the American company is denying other firms access to NFC terminals. It will be interesting to watch the next move in the battle of the Swiss payment apps.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Does the iPhone 7 have any competition right now? Yoni Heisler BGR NewsNovember 2, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share It's funny how things in the tech space play out sometimes. Apple's iPhone 7 was supposed to be a boring device, at best a stop-gap release designed to hold us over until the release of the radically redesigned iPhone 8. In fact, the idea that Apple's iPhone 7 was going to be a disappointment was so pronounced that it even prompted Samsung to accelerate development of its Galaxy Note 7 phablet, a decision which, as we now know, would end up costing the company billions. In truth, Apple's iPhone 7 was surprisingly compelling. From incredibly fast internal upgrades and battery life improvements to jaw-dropping new camera technologies, Apple's iPhone 7 has engendered more interest than most analysts or pundits initially assumed. DON'T MISS: This iPhone 7 video review from a hardcore Android fan is making Android users want to switch Speaking to this point, a new research note from UBS analyst Steven Milunovich relays that consumer interest in the iPhone 7 -- and the iPhone 7 in particular -- remains impressively high. While interest in the iPhone in China is reportedly waning, Milunovich is confident that overall demand for Apple's next-gen smartphone is sufficiently high enough to offset what may be a disappointing downturn in the Chinese market. UBS's research report, per Barron's, reads in part: Positives for Apple include: (1) almost half of US respondents are very or somewhat likely to purchase an iPhone 7, above even the 6 cycle two years ago; (2) the US shows a shift toward the Plus with a 9-point rise over the 6s; (3) Apple rates high in product uniqueness, and its customers are more concerned with design and less focused on price; (4) global smartphone penetration of 60% and high aspiration in the US and China allow opportunity for new customers; and (5) although Samsung’s retention rate has improved, 30% of its customers were at least somewhat less likely to go Samsung. Concerns for Apple include (1) although China interest in the 7 is not far behind the US, it is lower than China saw for either the 6 or 6s; (2) Apple’s retention rate fell in China though excluding users not planning future upgrades the rate held in–we model a single-digit decline in China units for F17; (3) upgrade cycles are slightly longer, reflected in our assumption that only 43% of the base upgrades in two years vs a more typical 50-60%; and (4) Apple fell in all categories of consumer perception. All in all, this bodes very well for Apple. Not only is interest in the iPhone 7 strong, but Apple's bottom line will be bolstered by better than anticipated demand for the more margin-friendly iPhone 7 Plus. Of course, once the holiday shopping season comes and goes, all eyes will begin focusing in on Apple's 2017 iPhone, a device likely to be called the iPhone 8. As we've reported previously, Apple's iPhone 8 will reportedly feature an edgeless OLED display with sensors embedded underneath it. Earlier this week, a report surfaced claiming that the iPhone 8 will also introduce a new wireless charging feature. Trending right now: Is this a reason to worry about the iPhone 8?

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 2, 2016 at 9:00AM This year, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) released two flagship smartphones -- the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus -- continuing with the trend that it set when it launched the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus back in late 2014. Next year, however, the iDevice maker is expected to break with that not-so-long-standing tradition and launch not just two iPhones, but three. Image source: Apple.  Per a report from generally reliable Japanese publication Nikkei, next year's iPhones will come in three different sizes. The smallest will be a 4.7-inch model, keeping with the tradition set with the launch of the iPhone 6. The next step up will be a 5-inch model, with a supposedly "premium" model occupying a pricing tier above the 5-inch mode. Even more interestingly, while the 4.7-inch and 5-inch models are expected to use flat liquid crystal displays, the 5.5-inch model is expected to employ a curved OLED display. This strategy is smart and could ultimately lead to both unit share gains for Apple in the premium portion of the smartphone market and a boost in average selling prices. Here's why. Of the three options, this one is probably best There's no denying that a certain segment of the smartphone-buying population appreciates the aesthetic of a curved OLED display. Such displays are certainly part of the reason the Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) Galaxy S7 Edge has done as well as it has in the marketplace, and why the major China-based smartphone manufacturers, such as Xiaomi, Huawei, and others, are rolling out premium smartphone models incorporating curved OLED displays. Putting curved OLED displays, especially high-quality ones that meet Apple's demanding display performance specifications, on a smartphone is unlikely to be cheap. So with the iPhone 8 generation, Apple was probably faced with the following options: Absorb the increased cost structure associated with putting curved OLED displays on all of its iPhone models. Restrict the use of curved OLED displays to a premium model, one that starts at a price much greater than what current iPhones start at. Don't use curved OLEDs on any iPhones during the iPhone 8 generation. Option 1 isn't desirable because it'd almost certainly be gross profit margin-dilutive. Option 3 may be viable, but it could cause Apple to lose both unit share and, perhaps equally importantly, mind share -- imagine hearing, for example, that "Apple is no longer innovative." Option 2, at least to this Fool, seems by far the best option. Customers who absolutely want the most cutting-edge display technology but prefer Apple and its software ecosystem will have the option of getting that technology from Apple -- for a higher price. That's preferable to not giving customers who want those features no choice but to buy devices from Apple's competitors -- hence the potential for Apple to gain share in premium smartphones. Apple CEO Tim Cook admitted on the company's October earnings call that demand for the iPhone 7 Plus relative to the cheaper iPhone 7 is greater than the company had originally planned for. So given the relative popularity of the iPhone 7 Plus, it's reasonable to believe that iPhone customers are willing to pay for innovative new features. Share gains and average selling price increases both on the table I believe that a decent portion of the Apple iPhone installed base would have gone with a non-premium iPhone as their next device. To the extent that those current customers do move up a tier -- and if the "premium" iPhone is attractive, this may be a common occurrence -- Apple should see a bump in the average selling price. However, what's potentially more interesting is that an iPhone that's a lights-out, technological tour-de-force could bring back into the Apple ecosystem customers who felt that Apple wasn't building products for them anymore. That could cover, for example, Galaxy S7 Edge and Galaxy Note7 buyers. Not only would bringing in a significant number of such customers help Apple drive unit-share gains, since these customers wouldn't have purchased iPhones otherwise, but again, it would also help average selling prices. The prospect of seeing these dynamics play out should be quite exciting to Apple stockholders, particularly given how much of Apple's business ultimately depends on iPhone sales.

Fortunately, Apple offers you a way to restore previously lost data from iCloud and the feature is streamlined and easy to use. Restoring lost files from iCloud Apple’s iCloud data restore works for all kinds of things you would normally store in the cloud that have been deleted. Among the things that you can restore are bookmarks from Safari, Calendars, Contacts, Files, and Reminders. You have 30 days after deleting something to restore it via iCloud, so if you notice something is gone, and it shouldn’t be, then it’s a good idea to get on top of this instead of procrastinating. When you restore something, it will replace everything that’s currently on all devices tied to your iCloud account. This means what you change isn’t going to only affect one of your devices, but it will sync to all of them. This might be something you want to keep in mind if you have one device set up differently from the rest. Most of the time however, users are going to have their content and settings uniform throughout their devices, so this shouldn’t be a problem. That said, we’ll show you how to restore everything from your iCloud account below. How to recover lost iCloud files Files just might be one of the most important things you can restore from iCloud. This is particularly important for those who use iCloud Drive and may have deleted a file from it from one of their devices by accident. Fortunately for you, Apple keeps an archive of your files for a period of time so you can easily restore them. Here’s how you can do that: 1) Open iCloud.com in your favorite web browser and log in with your Apple ID: 2) Once in, click on the Settings icon to open your iCloud settings: 3) When you get into your iCloud settings pane, scroll down and click on the blue Restore Files link. 4) When iCloud shows you a list of recently-deleted files, put a check mark in the boxes to the left of each one you want to bring back and click on the Restore File(s) button at the bottom right of the panel: 5) iCloud will now prompt you to make sure you’re sure you want to restore your files. Click on the blue Restore button in the prompt. iCloud will now return all your deleted files back to your account. It may take a few moments for them to sync to all your devices. An active internet connection is required on all of your devices for them to sync with iCloud. How to restore lost contacts The process to restore lost contacts via iCloud is similar. Follow these steps: 1) Open iCloud.com in your favorite web browser and log in with your Apple ID: 2) Open the Settings app from your iCloud Home screen: 3) When the Settings pane loads, scroll down and click on the blue Restore Contacts link. 4) When you see the archive of contacts backups, select the one you want to restore to and click on the blue Restore button to the right of it: 5) When prompted if you’re sure you want to proceed, click on the blue Restore button in the prompt to confirm. Now iCloud will sync all your devices with the restored contacts archive that you chose. Be patient until this finishes. How to restore calendars and reminders If you’re missing calendar events or reminders on any of your iCloud devices, you can follow these steps to restore those: 1) Open iCloud.com in your favorite web browser and log in with your Apple ID: 2) Launch the Settings app from the iCloud.com Home screen: 3) When the Settings pane finishes loading, click on the Restore Calendars and Reminders link at the bottom of the page: 4) Now, select the Calendars and Reminders archive you want to restore, and then click on the blue Restore button to the right of the selected archive: 5) When prompted if you’re sure you want to proceed, click on the blue Restore button at the bottom right of the prompt: Give the restore process a few minutes to complete. Soon, all of your iCloud devices that have an internet connection will have the archived Calendars and Reminders that you chose synced to them. How to restore bookmarks If you’re after bringing back your missing Safari bookmarks to your iOS device(s) and Mac(s) via an iCloud archive, then you will want to follow these steps: 1) Open iCloud.com in your favorite web browser and log in with your Apple ID: 2) Click on the Settings app from the iCloud.com Home screen to launch your iCloud settings: 3) Scroll all the way down and click on the blue Restore Bookmarks link at the bottom of the page: 4) When provided with an archive of recently-deleted Safari Bookmarks, choose the one you want to restore to your devices and click on the blue Restore button to the right of it. 5) You will be prompted to confirm your action, so just click on the blue Restore button at the bottom right of the prompt to proceed: After the step above, you will need to wait a few minutes for the changes to take effect across all of your devices. iCloud isn’t syncing the restored data to all my devices If you’re having trouble getting iCloud to sync all your freshly-restored data to your iOS devices and Macs, keep in mind that Apple says this process can take as much as 6 hours to complete. If it’s taking a long time, look into the following scenarios: Do you have a lot of devices? The more devices you have, the more devices iCloud has to push data to. Although it should be fast for 2-3 devices, any more than that could take substantially more time because of bandwidth issues. In these instances, sync times may take longer than expected. Are all of your devices on and connected to the internet? If you have any of your devices powered off or disconnected from the internet at the time you’re restoring data from iCloud, it will be unable to sync to these devices. You need to make sure they’re powered on and connected to an internet source so iCloud can push the data to them. Are all of your devices using the same iCloud account? If any of your devices are using a different iCloud account than you initiated the restore on, then the data from the iCloud restore you’re perusing won’t be synced to those devices. You need to be using the same iCloud account on all of your devices for your iCloud restore to be effective for all of them. Contact Apple If all else fails, give Apple a call. We’re sure they’ll be able to help straighten out your dilemma and help you get your device’s data up and running again! Conclusion The iCloud data restoring feature is a valuable tool for getting back important information that would otherwise be lost forever. This is a pretty good reason why you should back up your device regularly and use iCloud for all of the different kinds of data you want synced to all your devices.

And they were ones we’ve wanted for months. A day in the life of a UK dildo maker Finally, we have an avocado emoji (talk about overdue). We’ve got a facepalm one (ideal for dealing with meninists and trolls). Apple has even given us a creepy drooling face (anyone who sends you this – not in relation to food – should be immediately blocked). (Picture: Apple) Not content with simply adding to the emoji family, however, they’ve decided that some old classics needed to be revamped. That includes our old sexting partner, the peach. The peach emoji has gone from being a lovely, bouncy-looking bum to…an actual peach. And people everywhere are in mourning.

Trending in Apple Poll: What is your view of the all-USB-C ports on the new MacBook Pro? November 2 AAPL: 111.59 0.10 Phil Schiller addresses new MacBook Pro controversy, explains why Apple dropped the SD card reader but kept the headphone jack Benjamin Mayo - 2 weeks ago @bzamayo MacBook Pro View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit In an interview with The Independent, Apple marketing exec Phil Schiller discusses the development and public response to the new MacBook Pros. He says that “many things” have impressed people and “some” have caused some controversy, referring to the ongoing debates about Apple’s design goals versus the needs of pro users. Rebutting critics, Schiller announces that orders for the new MacBook Pro have set a new online sales record, beating previous sales for ‘pro Apple notebooks’. The interview also focuses in on a few specific complaints, such as the decision to remove the SD card slot but keep the 3.5mm headphone jack which it classed obsolete for the iPhone 7. Schiller has interesting answers for these questions … Regarding the lack of SD card reader, Schiller says the slot is “cumbersome” as an inserted card sticks out from the side of the machine. He also says that the format war between SD and CompactFlash means a portion of customers were already resorting to other means and Apple couldn’t keep everyone happy already. Schiller says more and cameras are relying on wireless transfer methods which are very useful. For new MacBook Pro owners, he recommends wireless transfer or buying an USB-C adaptor (like this one): The new Pros have no SD card slot for a camera memory card. Why not? Because of a couple of things. One, it’s a bit of a cumbersome slot. You’ve got this thing sticking halfway out. Then there are very fine and fast USB card readers, and then you can use CompactFlash as well as SD. So we could never really resolve this – we picked SD because more consumer cameras have SD but you can only pick one. So, that was a bit of a trade-off. And then more and more cameras are starting to build wireless transfer into the camera. That’s proving very useful. So we think there’s a path forward where you can use a physical adaptor if you want, or do wireless transfer. The Independent asked if it was “inconsistent to keep the 3.5mm headphone jack as it’s no longer on the latest iPhone”. Schiller said the 3.5mm jack is more than just about headphones for the laptops, which makes it different to the iPhone 7 situation. He says if it was just to plug in headphones, the port wouldn’t be necessary. However, the 3.5mm jack remains in the product as pros have “studio monitors, amps and other pro audio gear that do not have wireless solutions”. Schiller also confronts critics who saw the new MacBook Pros and were disappointed, suggesting Apple doesn’t care about the Mac business anymore, or at least the Mac desktop business. Schiller strongly disagrees and says “We love the Mac and are as committed to it, in both desktops and notebooks, as we ever have been.”. That being said, Schiller admits he was a bit surprised by the negative reactions, even though all Apple product fuels early criticism and debate. On the Touch Bar innovations, Schiller largely repeats what other Apple executives have said. Schiller says the notebook form factor is not going anyway anytime soon but the Touch Bar enables a more interactive experience that is “coplanar with the keyboard and trackpad”. Schiller also says that iOS and macOS are fundamentally different products and necessitate unique software. We’re steadfast in our belief that there are fundamentally two different products to make for customers and they’re both important. There’s iPhone and iPad which are single pieces of glass, they’re direct-manipulation, multi-touch and tend towards full-screen applications. And that’s that experience. And we want to make those the best in that direction anyone can imagine. We have a long road ahead of us on that. Then there’s the Mac experience, dominated by our notebooks and that’s about indirect manipulation and cursors and menus. We want to make this the best experience we can dream of in this direction. Schiller quotes one particular example, the Mac menubar. He says if you made the Mac a touchscreen, you’d have to work out a way to use the menubar with touch and says it is simply not as good or as intuitive as with a mouse and trackpad. Read the full interview with Apple’s SVP Marketing on The Independent’s website. In case you aren’t up to speed, Apple is releasing two new MacBook Pros this month. The cheaper 13 inch MacBook Pro, featuring upgraded CPUs, a thinner body and superfast SSD speeds, with two USB-C ports is available in stores now for $1499. The 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models with Touch Bar are not yet available; they feature four USB-C ports, faster CPU and GPUs, super-fast SSD, and a touchscreen in place of the function row to display dynamic controls and UI.

They all feature in the new batch of emoji released by Apple this week. And if that leaves you feeling like a “facepalm” might be in order, there’s one for that too. Bowie’s emoji has male and female versions, and for the first time the new set of pictograms includes female judges, teachers, firefighters, astronauts and plumbers. Previous series mostly depicted women as painting their nails and dancing salsa, while detectives, police officers and surfers were all exclusively male. The equality works both ways: the new set includes a prince and a groom, to complement the bride and princess that were already available. The release follows a big push by Google to promote gender equality through emoji. Google said in May it wanted its new range of professional women pictograms to promote “the diversity of women’s careers” and combat sexism. Apple released the beta version of its iOS 10.2 for iPhone and iPad to registered developers earlier this week. The update includes full support for 72 new emoji recently approved by the Unicode Consortium, a non-profit group that creates globally standardized emojifEmo and text characters. — Alanna Petroff contributed to this report.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Samsung who Supplies new OLED for 'Touch Bar' Hints that Apple may Expand OLED to Main Display | Main | Xiaomi's New 'Mi Mix' Premium Smartphone is out to steal the Industrial Design Spotlight away from Apple » November 02, 2016 Acer sees Apple's High MacBook Pro Pricing Knocking them out of the Top Five PC Vendors Worldwide for Q4   Last month Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple the only Major PC Company to have Negative Shipments in the U.S. and Worldwide for Q3." The thinking was that once Apple updated their PC line-up sales would rebound and Apple's standing in the PC market would once again rise. The problem is that Apple only updated their MacBook Pro with updates to Mac desktops being delayed to sometime in the first half of 2017 when Intel finally releases their 7th generation Core processors. Secondly, the MacBook Pro is more expensive than expected and for countries outside the US, such as Canada and the UK, the MacBook Pro is out of reach for most because of the strong U.S. dollar. Macworld noted today in their review of the MacBook Pro that two things stood out. "The Touch Bar looks lovely and, ouch, the price tag is steep." Yesterday Acer unveiled their new notebook line-up and basically thanked Apple for their steep price that would help them in the market over the holidays.   In Q3 IDC's report showed Apple in fourth spot for Q3 2016 while Gartner's report showed Apple in fifth spot with Acer a hair under Apple in sixth spot. Acer said that Apple's high MacBook Pro pricing opened the door for them to return to the the fifth spot for Q4 worldwide.   It was reported today in Taiwan that "A senior executive at Taiwanese PC maker Acer on Tuesday suggested Apple's pricing strategy for its latest notebooks could benefit the industry's 'Wintel' camp. With the spread of smartphones eating into their sales, PC brands could use the boost."   Dave Lin, president of Acer's Taiwan operations, told reporters during a launch event for his company's own new notebook in Taipei that "Apple's new MacBook Pro is way too expensive -- it's really not affordable for ordinary users."   Acer claims its new Swift 7 notebook, priced at US$1,360, is the world's thinnest laptop in the 13-inch-screen segment. "We aim to overtake Apple and return to be a top-five PC brand [by shipments] next year," Lin confidently said.   Of course by shipment stats alone, that could very well occur, but in terms of profits, Apple will probably crush most PC vendors as always.   In fact, Vincent Chen, head of regional research at Yuanta Investment Consulting, supports this view wholeheartedly by stating that "Apple is trying to focus on the high-end PC and smartphone market. Apple's MacBook Pro is synonymous with Hermes or Chanel in the PC market," Chen said. "Apple no longer wants to compete with any of the low-to-mid priced PCs in the market."   Chen added that "Apple's main strategy has shifted to generate more income from services rather than selling more hardware products."   Jessica Hsu, an analyst at Market Intelligence & Consulting Institute, echoed Chen's view and suggested Apple is not as fixated on market share as other PC makers.   Finally some market analysts are starting to see the value in making money instead of playing the volume game that the likes of IDC and Gartner love to play up as to what makes a leader in any given product category.   Yet with that said, the general opinion thus far on the net is that the MacBook Pro may be worth the price, but customers, especially outside of the U.S, may find it realistically out of reach for this year.     And one more thing: Beyond the price issue, it must be said that there's a lot of anger in the Pro Mac Community. This morning MacRumors posted a report titled "Professional Mac Users' Complaints List Grows After 'Disappointing' Apple Event."   The MacRumors report notes that "Over the weekend evidence mounted of a backlash within sections of the online Mac community in response to Apple's latest announcements. In a blog post on his site titled "New MacBook Pros and the State of the Mac", developer Michael Tsai collated and linked to the most commonly aired grievances. The post has since become a common point of reference in the blogosphere for negative sentiment toward Apple following last week's event."

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple has slashed the price of its storage upgrades for older build-to-order Macs, saving customers up to $200 on some upgrades. The cuts have been applied to last year’s MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Mac Pro, iMac, and Mac mini. Apple has always charged high prices for storage upgrades — especially when you consider how little the company actually pays suppliers for its storage drives. They’re still expensive even after the cuts, but at least they’re a little bit more affordable now. Until last week, a 512GB storage upgrade for entry-level machines was priced between $300 and $400 — depending on the Mac you were buying. However, the same storage upgrade can now be purchased for between $200 and $300. A 1TB storage upgrade was previously priced between $800 and $900, but Apple has reduced the price of this upgrade to between $600 and $700. For instance, those buying a midrange 27-inch iMac can now upgrade to 512GB of storage for $300, or 1TB of storage for $700. Just a week ago, these upgrades would have cost $400 and $900 respectively. The new MacBook Pro is still expensive “Higher-end options have also received a price drop,” reports 9to5Mac. “For example, the high-end 13-inch MacBook Air can be upgraded to 512GB for $200, which is $100 less than before. The high-end iMac can now be upgraded to 1TB for $100 less than before.” Apple’s cuts come at a time when the company is facing backlash from many consumers who believe the prices for its latest MacBook Pro are too high. An entry-level 13-inch machine with Touch Bar and Touch ID is $500 more than last year’s 13-inch MacBook Pro.

By Sarmistha Acharya November 2, 2016 12:31 GMT iPhone 8 might come with wireless charging technology Reuters Apple manufacturing partner Foxconn is reportedly making wireless charging modules for the upcoming iPhone 8, which is slated for launch in 2017. The introduction of the wireless charging feature in the iPhone is part of Apple's efforts to revamp the iPhone design to boost sales during the handset's 10th anniversary. However, it is unclear if all iPhone models slated for release next year will come with the wireless charging feature. A source with knowledge about the matter told the Nikkei Asian Review: "But whether the feature can eventually make it into Apple's updated devices will depend on whether Foxconn can boost the yield rate to a satisfactory level later on." Earlier this, year Bloomberg reported that Apple was working with partners in the US and Asia to develop new wireless charging technology to incorporate in its mobile devices expected in 2017. The cutting-edge technology would allow the iPhone and iPad to be charged from farther away, than the traditional charging mats. Apple was looking to deal with technical barriers including loss of power over distance. Market rivals such as Samsung and Google have smartphones supporting wireless charging that requires proximity to a charging plate. If the distance is longer between the transmitter and the receiver, then the efficiency of power transfer could decrease. This means the battery will take a long time to charge. Apple was reported to be working with Energous that develops WattUp wire-free charging, enabling wire-free charging from distances up to 15 feet. In May this year, Apple hired two former engineers from wireless charging startup uBeam with expertise in wireless charging and ultrasonic technology. In the past two years Apple has hired more than a dozen employees with expertise in wireless charging. Meanwhile, recent reports suggest Apple plans to replace the metal casing of the iPhone with a glass back and a metal frame in three iPhone variants expected in 2017. The 5.5in iPhone model is likely to adopt curved OLED screen, while the other two might come with flat LTPS screen. Tai Jeng-wu, president of Sharp, confirmed recently that the iPhone 8 would have OLED display.

clock menu more-arrow Circuit Breaker Apple Tech Review MacBook Pro review: the Air apparent More power, more portability, more dongles by Vlad Savov Nov 2, 2016, 8:15am EDT share tweet Linkedin If you’re a fan of Apple laptops, I’ve got some good news and some bad news. The good news: Apple has finally updated its Pro laptop line with some genuinely new and powerful options. Even better, the new MacBook Pro has been shrunken down to the degree of serving as the MacBook Air’s spiritual successor, which is what many of us had been hoping for all along. The bad news? Apple isn’t just giving, it’s also taking away. At first blush, the new 13-inch MacBook Pro, sans fancy Touch Bar, looks like the perfect replacement for my aged MacBook Air from 2013. It’s the thinnest and lightest Pro ever, and it provides the display and performance upgrades my three-year-old laptop has been in desperate need of. Costing $1,499, it sits right in the middle between Apple’s $1,299 MacBook and the new $1,799 MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar and four Thunderbolt ports. It’s like the Air, in that it bridges the gap between Apple’s most portable and most powerful mobile computers, but it does so in an interesting new way. Without the much-ballyhooed additions of Touch Bar interactions and Touch ID on the pricier new MacBook Pro models — which won’t be shipping for weeks — this more basic MBP is essentially the professionalization of the 12-inch MacBook. It’s a bigger and significantly more powerful version of that super-thin machine. More of a pro MacBook than a MacBook Pro. If you wanted a bigger and more powerful MacBook, this is it Why does it feel more like a MacBook? Well, just look at it. The familiar MagSafe charger is gone, retired along with Apple’s SD card reader, HDMI output, and old-school USB ports. This $1,499 MacBook Pro strips connectivity down to just a headphone jack on its right side and two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 3 on the left. That’s it. You also get the new option to style it out in a handsome space gray and an upgraded version of the MacBook’s super flat butterfly-mechanism keyboard. All of this, along with the solid-state Force Touch trackpad, expresses Apple’s modernized laptop design, whose signature change is the frenzied push of USB-C as the unitary replacement for all the world’s ports. Apple is determined to force the future into existence, and this laptop is just the next logical step. Logical though it may be for Apple, this MacBook Pro presents a dichotomy. Professional video editors and photographers have been waiting for a new Pro laptop — but this midrange MacBook Pro probably isn’t that. Instead, the world’s coffee shops are filled with nomadic professionals seeking an Apple computer to replace the much more ubiquitous, but now dated, MacBook Air. So while Apple has been busy crafting the Pro MacBook, the way it will be received by most people is the way that I’m addressing it today: as a Pro MacBook Air. The MacBook Air kicked off the ultrabook trend among laptops before Intel even coined that term. Its familiar wedge shape has been copied by almost everyone, and it has served as a benchmark for thinness, battery life, and industrial design in its category. But the Air design hasn’t changed in six long years. In the meantime, Lenovo’s Yoga laptops reinvented the hinge, Dell’s XPS 13 reinvented the display, Razer reinvented the keyboard, and Microsoft reconfigured our entire idea of a laptop. The Air once stood alone as an ultra-portable with negligible compromises, but now there’s competition, and the Air has fallen dramatically behind with its anachronistic, washed-out screen. So Apple’s first task is to simply get its slimmest 13-inch laptop back on par with its Windows rivals. And it all starts with the industrial design. Apple’s industrial design remains best-in-class The new MacBook Pro is precision engineering at its absolute finest. Run your finger along the spartan, portless side of this laptop and you won’t detect even a millimeter’s discrepancy between the bottom chassis and the top lid. They are two separate parts, but when the MacBook Pro is closed, they feel like one cohesive, solid slab of aluminum. The final vestiges of plastic on the exterior have been shorn off, replaced by a metal bottom to the display and a sapphire glass Apple logo that no longer lights up. Yes, this is very much the MacBook design scaled up. (One advantage to the new Apple logo is that you’ll no longer see its ghostly presence on your screen when there’s a strong light behind your laptop. That used to frustrate me on sunny days with the Air, and it felt like a distinctly un-Apple-like oversight in the overall design.) The interior of the new MacBook Pro is another spot that will be familiar to MacBook users, but largely foreign to everyone else. The keyboard’s keys seem to have been melted down into millimeter-thick slabs: they’re wider and a little more densely packed than on an Air or earlier Pro models. I found them alien at first, but once I stopped "testing the keyboard" and just started typing naturally, I found my rhythm and was quickly up to full speed — after a while, these larger keys start to feel like big input islands that are hard to miss. Their key travel is a shallow 0.55mm, which won’t be to everyone's taste, but this updated MBP keyboard definitely has a better feel than the practically flat one on the MacBook. The Rolls-Royce of touchpads, offering outsized luxury and unerring operation Apple’s touchpad on this year’s MacBook Pro is something special. It spans the entire height of the wrist rest and half the width. It’s enormous, limousine-sized, and seemingly excessive, but I love it. The vastness of this thing means it’s always within easy reach, and because it’s built using Force Touch — simulating the tactile response of a click without ever moving — I can click the top of it in a way that I can’t do with the mechanical switch of my MacBook Air. I also like this new touchpad for the sheer visual appeal: compared to older versions, it looks like a display that’s had its bezels removed; like cutting-edge, space-maximizing technology. Not being mechanical also means it’ll stay this way for years, whereas my Air’s more conventional trackpad has developed a slight creaking habit. Compared to my MacBook Air, the new Pro has a much smaller footprint, yet feels larger and more accommodating in use. That's mostly thanks to the touchpad, but the larger keys on the keyboard also help. The display’s bezels are vastly thinner and with the stereo speakers sitting either side of the keyboard, Apple has basically left no wasted space on the 13-inch MacBook Pro. There’s even a double-wide Escape key, perhaps to make up for its loss on the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. I’m writing this entire review on the 2016 MacBook Pro and I frankly don’t want to go back to typing on my Air. It’s a universally better experience. If you were still harboring reservations about either the flatter keyboard or artificially clicking touchpad of the MacBook, this new MBP is sure to allay them in a hurry. The absolute biggest upgrade for any Air user will be the display. The new Pro’s 2560 x 1600 display is gorgeous, from literally any angle, and it matches the wider color gamut of the latest iPhone 7 models and Apple’s 5K iMac. Even for existing MacBook Pro users, this is a nice step up in contrast and brightness (now 500 nits versus the prior model’s 300), both of which are 67 percent higher. Apple may be killing us softly with all these incremental upgrades, but they really do add up to a supremely well-designed machine. The same wide color gamut as on the 5K iMac and iPhone 7, now on a laptop Beside its great build quality and fantastic display, the new MacBook Pro also performs superbly. I am swiping between desktops and darting in and out of heavy-duty apps like Adobe’s Lightroom and Photoshop with perfect ease and fluidity. The external polish is very much matched by the internal performance, and I struggle to imagine scenarios where anyone would feel constrained by this, the so-called entry-level, Pro laptop. It’s not a cheap computer by any means, so you should expect nothing less, of course. I would go further and say that if you’re not involved in high-volume, high-resolution photo or video processing, you should just stick with the basic 2GHz Core i5 CPU and 8GB of RAM. Anything else would be overkill for most people. Any doubts about why this new MacBook Pro exists while being so similar to the MacBook should really be extinguished by its performance. The Pro has a much more powerful processor and smoother graphics to go along with a significantly improved keyboard and a titanic trackpad. The MacBook is still the better computer to take on a flight with you, but the MacBook Pro approaches its level of portability while offering vastly more power and a longer-lasting battery. Like an artfully carved chess set without a queen, this laptop is lovely but is missing vital pieces It’s at this point that I would have expected to be able to say to Air users that they can stop reading and should just go buy the new MacBook Pro. But Apple’s futurism has expressed itself in less advantageous ways, too. The Cupertino company has both given and taken away. Vjeran Pavic For starters, the SD card slot is gone from the new MacBook Pro. A company that built up its entire product line on the adulation and money of professional photographers is now turning its back on them and blowing up the best bridge between the tools of their trade: camera and laptop. Without an SD card slot in the computer, we’re left having to tote an adapter everywhere ($50 when bought from Apple), or buying a USB-C cable for our cameras ($30), or relying on entirely unreliable wireless transfer apps. Maybe that’s fine on the MacBook, but it’s not okay on the MacBook Pro. Apple’s solution for everything cabled is now a combined Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C port, of which the company provides two on the Touch Bar-deprived MacBook Pro I am reviewing. Is there any technical reason why this computer couldn’t have four, like the $1,799 model with a Touch Bar? Nope, it all comes down to price. Two USB-C ports are still double the number I’d get on a MacBook, but they’re both on the left side of the MBP and are compatible with nothing I own other than, amusingly, my Android phones. The future may be wireless, but the present is full of dongles The cool thing about the pricier MacBook Pros is that they split their USB-C ports evenly, two on each side, and since you can use any one of them to charge, that lets you pick which side to plug the charger into. I’ve always thought that an underrated advantage of Google’s Chromebook Pixel, but in Apple’s world, $1,499 is apparently not enough to unlock ambidextrous convenience. The MacBook Pro does have a headphone jack, unlike the new iPhone 7, but that’s hardly a consolation since buying the two devices together would mean either carrying around two sets of headphones or always having yet another dongle with you. Apple has chosen one unifying port for everything that plugs into the Mac, and it has one unifying port for everything connecting to the iPhone. But the problem is that they’re not the same port. If I want to plug an iPhone into my MacBook Pro, I’ll need a dongle or a new cable ($25 from Apple), and neither is provided with either Macs or iPhones. And there’s no interchanging iPad peripherals with MacBook Pro ones, even as the two devices continue along a path toward converging into one. If I want to connect an external hard drive to back up my MacBook Pro data, I’ll need a USB adapter ($19). If I want to plug into Ethernet because the Wi-Fi around me sucks, I’ll need a new dongle ($35), different from those already in existence for prior MacBooks. If I want to connect to an external display or projector to do a work presentation, I’ll have to choose between the VGA dongle ($40) or the AV multiport dongle that includes HDMI ($69). If I bought into Apple’s previous Thunderbolt promotions and have any Thunderbolt accessories, those will need an adapter, too ($49). You can find most — if not all — of these adapters for less money than what Apple is charging. But many people won’t bother. And for those who do, the quality and consistency of USB-C hubs leaves a lot to be desired right now. Stare long enough into the immaculate, minimalist symmetry of that pair of USB-C ports, and you too might perceive the alluring future of personal computers. The future. But we live in a present where Windows XP is still widely used by businesses resistant to change. A world where the aforementioned VGA port is still the likeliest way to get visuals off your laptop in a boardroom meeting. And that thing’s almost as old as I am! Apple is making users adapt to it when it should be adapting to users Apple is forcing me to accept the loss of compatibility with USB sticks, USB drives, USB Ethernet adapters, HDMI cables, and, most painfully, MagSafe chargers, all because it’s decided to be impatient about the future. I’m not disputing the advantages of standardizing around USB-C, but I question how fast others will follow Apple’s lead here — MacBooks don’t have quite the same industry-wide influence as iPhones — and in turn how quickly this inconvenience will disappear for people like me. Apple could have at least kept the SD card slot alive, as a gesture to some of its most loyal fans and to ease the transition. The MagSafe charger has been another mainstay of Apple laptops for years, latching magnetically into place with ease and disconnecting just as easily should the power cable get yanked away. Its plug has an LED light that indicates charging status. It gently decouples from the laptop without needing your intervention. It’s kind of perfect. In its place, Apple’s new USB-C connector is hard to pull out and requires actual attention while doing so. There’s no charging indicator, either — though there is a little jingle, just as with your phone, when the charger is successfully connected. This change is good in that it moves Apple to a broader industry standard, but bad in that it downgrades the convenience and ease of use of the entire laptop. Vjeran Pavic Battery life on this new MacBook Pro doesn’t rival the Air’s 12 hours, but it does achieve Apple’s claimed 10 hours. I’m a writer, so my typical use may be a bit more forgiving than other professionals, however I keep seeing a perfect match between remaining percentage and hours of battery life left: 56 percent equals five and a half hours, 22 percent will get me two and a quarter hours, and so on. Apple seems to have very deliberately targeted 10 hours as its goal and benchmark. You can expect to get less if you throw some intensive photo or video editing at this MacBook Pro, but I have little to no worries about the battery; it lasts a consistently long time. And don’t forget that you’re getting a more productive machine: editing photos on the Air’s old and faded display was essentially color guesswork, whereas Apple’s new laptop would delight photographers if only it offered them a way to get their photos onto the damn thing. For the first time in seven years, I’m not sure that my next laptop will be a MacBook While the display, build quality, and looks of the new MacBook Pro are beyond reproach, they’re no longer beyond the competition. Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Yoga has a spectacular OLED display. Dell’s XPS 13 has great battery life and design. HP’s EliteBook Folio has a hinge that folds out to a full 180 degrees, whereas Apple’s laptops have always been limited to opening to a little bit beyond vertical. Razer’s Blade Stealth has a 4K touchscreen, Thunderbolt 3, and the latest seventh-gen Intel processors, whereas Apple is still using sixth-gen chips. Why does any of that matter? It matters because this new MacBook Pro’s compromises are large enough to make me, a loyal and satisfied MacBook user for seven years, look outside the cozy confines of Apple’s ecosystem. Apple has built a beautiful computer with all the upgrades I wanted, but it’s taken away things that I actually need, and now I’m looking elsewhere. To Apple’s credit, there’s no single Windows laptop that yet matches all of the MacBook line’s key strengths — touchpad ergonomics, battery life, display, and industrial design — but Apple’s changes have now created an opportunity that didn’t exist before. All a Windows vendor needs to do to convince me is to build something as good as a MacBook and then top it off with a simple SD card slot. macOS isn’t as major an advantage as it used to be, especially for someone like me whose professional life revolves around Google and Adobe’s cloud services. When it launched the MacBook in 2015, Apple wasn’t shy about claiming it had reinvented the laptop. With the benefit of some hindsight, I’d argue Apple only reinvented its own product line. Copycat designs have arisen, as they always do, but the MacBook’s biggest impact so far has been within Apple’s walled-in ecosystem. We can see more of the new MacBook’s DNA in the new MacBook Pro than original MacBook Pro features. This is just the way Apple laptops are made now and we can either learn to like it or go elsewhere. Apple could have been a USB-C trailblazer even while retaining a classic USB port and SD card slot And that, frankly, is the problem here. Apple is trying to return to its old habit of dragging us forward into the future like a wild-eyed inventor, but this time it might have cut a little too deep into present-day functionality while trying to promote tomorrow’s technology. Apple could have been a major trailblazer for USB-C even while retaining a classic USB port and a photographer-friendly SD card slot. I don’t think those things would have disrupted the MacBook Pro’s scrupulously perfected proportions or Apple’s bottom line too much. I don’t know if I’ll be buying this MacBook Pro, in spite of its superb design and performance, and that’s surprising to me. There’s no doubt that this is the best computer for current MacBook Air owners to upgrade to, should they be unwilling or uninterested in giving Windows or Chrome OS a shot. I’m also confident that this 13-inch MacBook Pro is a better, more versatile, functional, and powerful laptop than the 12-inch MacBook, so I’d recommend spending the extra cash if those are your only choices. Having used Apple’s Touch Bar on the more expensive MacBook Pros, I’d say that’s an intriguing and nicely executed addition, but the price for those models is really quite silly right now. But think carefully before you decide that you’re irrevocably locked into the Apple ecosystem. If its future is going to be characterized by such hostile decisions as the removal of the headphone jack from the iPhone or the scything off of the beloved MagSafe and SD card slot from laptops, maybe Apple isn’t your best friend anymore. Can this company continue to claim it’s looking out for its users’ best interests while discarding some of their most necessary tools? The new MacBook Pro is as beautiful and desirable as ever, but using it is alienating to anyone living in the present. I agree with Apple’s vision of the future. I’m just not buying it today.

Some call the company revolutionary, others call it a copycat and still others treat it with pointed disdain. Regardless of where you stand on the matter, you have to admit that Apple did its best to stick to its driving philosophy — simplicity. Simplicity Simplicity is an elegant and powerful concept that only works if things are, well, simple. The underlying complexity of any solution is irrelevant if your interaction with that solution is simple. Tapping on a photo on your phone, for example, involves an exceedingly complex array of algorithms and physics that would boggle the average mind. Do you need to understand the relation between capacitance, voltages and quantum physics to tap the screen? Of course not; you tap on the image, it expands on the screen. It’s simple. Apple’s hardware had always followed this concept. When Steve Jobs unveiled the Macintosh, this is what he harped on. You take the device out of the box, you plug it in, and it works. You’re not messing with cables, separate monitors, graphics card and power supplies. The subsequent MacBook Airs and Pros followed the same philosophies as well. They were simple, powerful devices that were a breeze to use. Did you have to dig into your bag for adapters? No. The MacBook Air did, admittedly, offer limited connectivity options, but even the slimmest Apple laptop of its time offered 4 ports — a 3.5mm audio jack, a USB 2.0 port, mini-DVI port for video output and a “MagSafe” power adapter. Why? They were essential for keeping things simple for the consumer. Contrast this with the 12-inch MacBook and the current lineup of MacBook Pros. With these devices, you’ve lost everything that’s of any use and gained USB Type-C ports that even Apple doesn’t yet use universally. In fact, you don’t even get an SD card slot on what is arguably the photographers’ favourite laptop. A is for Apple Adapter Apple 2010: “There’s an app for that” Apple 2016: “There’s an adapter for that” — Braaains (@Lafond66) October 31, 2016 Just take a minute to think of Apple’s current ecosystem for a minute. You have the iPhone 7, which uses a lightning to USB-A connector, EarPods that use the Lightning connector (the wireless AirPods have been delayed), Thunderbolt drives that connect via Thunderbolt or USB-A and a bunch of accessories, hard disks and adapters that all use USB-A connectors. Apple’s Thunderbolt display also uses, as the name suggests, a Thunderbolt connector.   This is your future #appleevent #MacBookPro pic.twitter.com/fN4vQFMZmf — Zer (@AlimonyMindset) October 27, 2016 With the MacBook and new MacBook Pro, you’re getting USB-C slots and a 3.5mm slot. Can you connect your iPhone to the MacBooks without an adapter? No. Can you connect your new EarPods to your MacBook without an adapter? No. Can you connect your Thunderbolt display to your MacBook without an adapter? No. Can you connect a portable drive without an adapter? No. In fact, the only thing that Apple provides that can connect directly to your MacBook out of the box is the USB-C power adapter that comes with the new MacBooks. Everything else is a compulsory extra. Apple’s fastest growing product category. pic.twitter.com/d1sel4N5Yc — Drew Breunig (@dbreunig) October 28, 2016 I don’t know about you, but my travel kit consists of a laptop, a phone, a power bank, a camera, a portable HDD and a thumb drive. If that laptop is the new MacBook Pro, nothing I have will connect to it without an adapter. Nothing. And I’m just an average user who likes to take a lot of photos. I used to like MacBooks for their simplicity. The devices were pricey, yes, but they offered great build quality, battery life and display, and the essential connectivity that I needed. They were simple and they worked. Now, not so much.   New #apple logo. src:https://t.co/26eRBKbpRR pic.twitter.com/j9R2CqeFYp — Mocking G33K (@g33xter) October 30, 2016 A few years hence, we might very well be living in a world that thrives on USB-C, but that time is not now and even Apple hasn’t adequately prepared for it. So why in the world is Apple shoving USB-C at us? Courage? I think hubris would be more apt. Apple’s USP is its ecosystem. What happens when that fails? Different for the sake of it The 2016 MacBook Pro is a brilliantly confused product that doesn’t know who it’s targeting or why. All Apple had to do was slap on a single USB-A port and an SD card reader and everyone would have been happy. While we’re at it, was it really necessary to kill the 3.5mm jack on the iPhone? When asked about the new MacBook Pro, Jony Ive told CNET, “What we won’t do is just do something different that’s no better.” Well, the new MacBook Pro is different and it’s no better. In fact, it’s worse.

Blog Support Store Developer Get Involved Archive Switching from macOS: The Basics We’ve been getting a ton of traffic at elementary.io and hearing a lot of chatter from Apple users after the underwhelming MacBook Pro event last week—mainly that Apple has abandoned the “Pro” market for which so many of their products are named. With this week-ish-long series, I’d love to show you how elementary OS is great for both casual computer users and professional developers. Particularly those coming from or more familiar with macOS. Today I’m kicking off with: The Basics. While it’s not intended to be a 1:1 copy, elementary OS will be familiar to macOS converts in a few key ways: The Dock It has a dock at the bottom of the screen with your favorite and currently running apps. These can be arranged with drag and drop and have extra app-specific actions behind a secondary (two-finger or right) click, similar to macOS. The hiding behavior in elementary OS, however, is so much better than the dock in macOS! In macOS, the dock can either autohide at all times, or not hide at all which are both inconvenient; it’s either totally in your way or totally invisible. By default in elementary OS, the dock is there when there’s room, but hides when it’s in the way. You can also choose between a few more smart modes, always visible, or always autohiding if any of those are more your thing. The Panel & Indicators There is a panel at the top of the screen. This is similar to the macOS panel in that it houses status indicators and their menus to the right, but does differ in a few ways. The indicators at the right are well-designed and well-thought-out. Session controls (like switching users, shutting down, etc.) are all in a single indicator instead of split between a user menu and the Apple menu. The sound indicator not only gives you volume controls for output and input, but lets you control media apps with track info, album artwork, play/pause, and back/forward. Other indicators include the power indicator (which names and shames energy-sucking apps, similar to macOS), the network indicator, Bluetooth (which allows for one-click pairing/disconnecting devices), and the Notification Center, which houses timed out notifications similar to macOS. The clock is in the center of the panel and houses a quick calendar popover for checking dates without opening an app. The Applications Menu lives at the far left of the panel. Apps don’t put their menu up here; most apps use more contextual actions instead of a menu bar, but if they do provide a menu bar it lives in the app window itself. The Applications Menu The Applications Menu, like macOS Launchpad, has a grid of icons and a fast search. However, there are some extra features here like a categorized view and the ability to directly perform apps’ actions such as “Private Browsing” in the browser either by searching or right clicking the application icon. It’s really best to think of it more as a combination of Launchpad and Spotlight. Similarly, it can be launched from the keyboard with Command + Space. A Quick Note about Default Apps Many apps will feel familiar, or at least intuitive. System Settings is similar to what you’ll find in macOS, as are the browser (Epiphany instead of Safari), Mail, Files (instead of Finder), and Terminal apps (more on Files and Terminal in an upcoming “Developer Environment” post). While some apps like Music and Videos may look simpler than those in macOS, they’re packed with great features while still being easy to learn and use. Again, elementary OS is not trying to be a copy of macOS, so some things do differ. But generally you’ll find comparable functionality and design elements that feel familiar. The Multitasking View Lastly, something that several macOS switchers have pointed out they love is Multitasking View in elementary OS. You launch Multitasking View from the icon in the dock or with Command + S. It’s kind of like Mission Control in macOS, but more streamlined. At the bottom you get iconified versions of all the open workspaces, as well as an always-new one on the right. The windows on your current workspace shrink down to give you an overview (like Expose in macOS), and you can drag and drop apps between workspaces. Fullscreened apps get their own workspace, and there are a number of ways to switch between them with keyboard shortcuts. Further Reading For some more information (and all sorts of keyboard shortcuts), be sure to check out the official elementary OS Learning the Basics documentation! If you’ve switched to elementary OS from macOS, feel free to share your favorite features or differences in the comments below. Tomorrow I’ll be writing about elementary OS as a Developer Environment, so stop back by. :) elementary os loki open source Linux macOS 49 notes cassidyjames Nov 1st, 2016 Open in app Facebook Tweet Mail Permalink lesovik314 liked this developerq liked this rnjohnson18 liked this theearthhawk liked this wasabiz liked this hashcool liked this professionalshaps liked this jonatanyair liked this beautifuldarkrose liked this juanvcworld liked this themadtux liked this beautifully--crafted liked this dpencilpusher liked this aghigi liked this veerarjunsingh liked this dadotmukti liked this kalikoke liked this 600f1 liked this ididntwakeupinanewbugatti liked this davidpalexander liked this luicifer999 liked this alperslog liked this spartan2276 reblogged this from elementaryos spartan2276 liked this combuskev liked this impostors-platitude liked this boywithwings reblogged this from elementaryos smpetrey liked this compudicted reblogged this from elementaryos shanesemler liked this tommychheng liked this libragera liked this manere liked this lestr4wberry liked this reigezda reblogged this from elementaryos tylerfinck liked this oleshu liked this merverb liked this vjdhama liked this carrotisland liked this gnclmorais liked this gigiopix liked this rana2no1 liked this laminko liked this alexblog-stuff liked this miyoyyo liked this wholocked-shurtugal liked this hamnetdeui liked this efbxd liked this elementaryos posted this Show more notesLoading...

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Competitions GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: iOS 10 Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / News / Fitness News / Apple Watch gets a camera strap, but it’s seriously expensive Apple Watch gets a camera strap, but it’s seriously expensive by Sean Keach 02 November 2016 0 shares Read Comments The Apple Watch doesn’t have a camera, but that doesn’t mean it can’t have a camera. An Israeli start-up called Glide has created a new watch strap for the Apple Watch that features a built-in camera, allowing you to snap photos directly from your wrist. The strap, which is aptly named CMRA, will set you back $249 – but there’s a limited time offer of $149 available right now. Either way, that’s a hefty charge, especially considering the Apple Watch itself will already set you back more than £250. The main camera on the strap is outward-facing, and uses a Sony sensor with a resolution of 8-megapixels. But there’s also a second upwards-facing camera that will let you take selfies using a 2-megapixel sensor. Glide says you’ll be able to capture audio and “HD video quality” with the CMRA, and has even included a quick-capture button on the strap for ease-of-use. There’s also a bit of digital image processing, specifically tilt-balancing, lens correction, and noise reduction. And if you’re worried about dodgy Apple fans surreptitiously filming your every move, you’ll be glad to know that there’s a built-in LED on the CMRA that glows when the camera is active. “The smartphone has become our primary camera,” said Ari Roisman, CEO of Glide. “With all of its conveniences, the smartphone is big, and it lives in your pocket. It takes time to retrieve, quickly runs out of battery, and is far from rugged.” He continued: “What if you could capture more and carry less? What if capturing a moment were as easy as blinking your eye? You wouldn’t need to step out of the moment in order to save it. And you wouldn’t need to have an expensive, delicate device in your hand every time you wish to preserve or share a memory. This is the future of the camera. This is CMRA." The other good news is that the CMRA has its own built-in battery, pledging 30 minutes of video per charge, or “hundreds of photos”. If you pre-order, you’ll get a charging dock worth $60 that charges both devices together. This also includes a battery pack that holds two full charges. The CMRA straps come in three core colours (black, blue, and white), as well as a limited edition grey hue for pre-order customers only. Glide reckons shipping will begin in spring 2017, but take any such estimates with due caution when you’re splashing out on a start-up gadget.

Resend activation e-mail Infinite Loop / The Apple Ecosystem Review: The $1,499 2016 MacBook Pro is an expensive MacBook Air on the inside Touch Bar tests must wait, but this MBP is neither high-end nor entry-level. by Andrew Cunningham - Nov 2, 2016 11:30 am UTC Login to bookmark 506 Andrew Cunningham The $1,499 version of the 2016 13-inch MacBook Pro.

You can't fault longtime die-hard Mac users for being a little frustrated with Apple. In the space of just a decade, they've watched their favorite platform go from being the center of the company's attention to a minor line item. The iPhone gets refreshed promptly and consistently every September, while some Macs sit there for one or two or three years without even being mentioned. Macs aren't even regularly refreshed with new processors from Intel, Nvidia, and AMD as they're released anymore; we could rely on that as recently as three years ago. The new MacBook Pros—released, for the record, a year and a half after the 2015 models, which were in some cases changed very little from the 2014 and 2013 models—have been birthed into this era of frustration. As a result, the initial reaction has been harsher than it would have been if Apple refreshed the Mac with the same regularity that it managed back in 2012 or 2013. But not everyone is a longtime Mac user, and divorced from that context what you've got in the new MacBook Pros is a lineup of very nice-looking (if not game-changing) laptops that combine a refreshed design with a healthy dose of updated technology. Today, we'll be examining the $1,499 version of the 13-inch MacBook Pro, the version with the row of function keys in place of the ballyhooed Touch Bar. We'll be examining the other 13- and 15-inch model thoroughly when we can get them, of course, but the $1,499 version still tells us a lot about the design, the keyboard, the new Thunderbolt 3 ports, and about Apple's design priorities and the Pro's target audience. Differences between the Touch Bar model and this one Specs at a glance: 13-inch 2016 Apple MacBook Pro (Two Thunderbolt 3 ports) Screen 2560×1600 at 13.3" (227 PPI) OS OS X 10.12.1 Sierra CPU 2.0GHz Intel Core i5-6360U (Turbo up to 3.1GHz) RAM 8GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 (soldered, upgradeable to 16GB at purchase) GPU Intel Iris 540 (integrated, 64MB eDRAM) HDD 256GB PCIe 3.0 x4 solid-state drive Networking 867Mbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2 Ports 2x Thunderbolt 3, headphones Size 11.97" × 8.36" × 0.59" (304.1 mm × 212.4 mm × 14.9 mm) Weight 3.02 lbs (1.37 kg) Battery 54.5Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $1,499.99 Price as reviewed $1,499.99 Other perks 720p webcam, backlit keyboard, dual integrated mics The Touch Bar is the biggest feature separating this entry-level MacBook Pro from the more expensive models, but there are some other small and not-so-small differences you have to live with when you opt for the $1,499 model. This is the complete list—otherwise, assume that the two share all the same features. The low-end Pro uses a 15W Core i5-6360U CPU with an Intel Iris 540 GPU; the high-end model uses a 28W Core i5-6267U CPU with an Intel Iris 550 GPU. The difference, aside from small boosts to CPU and GPU clock speeds, is that the 28W model can run faster for longer and throttle less frequently. The 15W model can also consume less power. The low-end Pro uses a single “Alpine Ridge” Thunderbolt 3 controller from Intel while the high-end Pro uses two Thunderbolt controllers (one of those controllers uses "reduced PCI Express bandwidth," which I assume means it's using PCI Express 2.0 instead of 3.0). Intel’s Thunderbolt controllers support a maximum of two Thunderbolt 3 ports each, and while many PC OEMs are shipping Thunderbolt 3, none is providing more than one or two ports. The low-end Pro uses 1866MHz LPDDR3 RAM while the high-end Pro uses 2133MHz LPDDR3. Apple has said it’s using LPDDR3 to save power, but it’s also the reason the systems max out at 16GB. The low-end Pro actually has a larger battery than the high-end one: 54.5Whr compared to 49.2Whr. Apple says both laptops have 10 hours of battery life, but the lower-power processor, the larger battery, and the lack of a little second screen above the keyboard should all mean that the low-end model actually lasts a bit longer than the Touch Bar model. The low-end model includes two integrated mics, while the high-end model includes three. Look and feel If the Retina MacBook was what you’d get if an iPad and a MacBook Air were put into the Large Hadron Collider and smashed into each other, the new MacBook Pro is what you’d get if you took the Retina MacBook and the first Retina MacBook Pro and did the same thing. Like the MacBook, the new Pros are slimmer, have much smaller display bezels and footprints, and jettison many ports. Like the previous Pro, they’re a uniform thickness throughout rather than tapered, they’ve still got more powerful processors, and because of those more powerful components they still have fans inside. The Pro’s construction is still rock solid despite being thinner and lighter, and there’s still not a trace of creaking or flexing anywhere in its aluminum unibody design. If you were bothered by previous designs’ unadorned metal or the hard corners of their wrist rests, none of that has changed. Apple does offer both a “space gray” finish alongside the classic silver, though the MacBook’s gold and rose gold finishes and the iPhone 7’s black and jet black finishes aren’t available. I tend to prefer darker gray and black colors when I can get them, and the space gray finish is really nice even if it still bothers me that Apple can’t quite keep the “space gray” color consistent across different product lines and model years. At 3.02 pounds, the new Pro is around half a pound lighter than last year’s and roughly the same weight as the 13-inch MacBook Air. I’m jumping from the 13-inch Air to the 13-inch Pro since I can’t quite live with the 12-inch MacBook’s performance or its individual port, so if you’re making that jump the laptop is going to feel exactly the same in your bag. The weight savings is noticeable but not life-changing if you’re coming from an earlier Retina model, but remember that it’s a full 1.5 pounds lighter than a pre-Retina, 13-inch unibody Pro—if you’re coming from one of those older machines, it makes a huge difference. The laptop’s fan is normally not audible in a room with little to no ambient noise. You can definitely notice it spin up if you’re pushing the laptop’s performance for an extended period, but it’s quieter than the previous Pros or Airs, and it’s much quieter than the jet engine-style noises that come out of some PC Ultrabooks. Even when the fan is going at full-tilt, the laptop can still get pretty warm, especially underneath and on the area above the keyboard. Still, it never gets too uncomfortable to hold or rest on your lap.

A company called Glide has a new product that will fix that omission and won’t impact the runtime of the Apple Watch itself. The product is called the CMRA strap. The CMRA strap adds a 2MP camera that faces the wearer of the Apple Watch and an 8MP camera that faces away from the wearer to allow them to take pictures of whatever they may see. “The camera is only valuable when it is out and ready to take a photo or video,” says Glide CEO Ari Roisman. “Our phones live in our pockets.” The idea behind having two cameras on your Apple Watch strap is a good one for many people. You can do things like take selfies and video chat on the watch. Glide is taking pre-orders for the watch band right now. While you can pre-order now, the CMRA band isn’t set to ship until next spring. The CMRA strap will sell for $249 at normal retail pricing. The cheapest pre-order price for those who order earliest is $149 with normal pre-order pricing set at $199. That isn’t cheap and you do need to charge both the watch and the CMRA strap. The strap does have 8GB of its own storage for images. Another nice tidbit is that the CMRA charger can also charge the watch at the same time and has an integrated battery allowing you to charge your watch and the strap two times each while on the go. Buyers have the option of black, blue and white colors. A special grey color is available for pre-orders only.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) Share Written by Jean-Louis Gassée Editor, Monday Note November 02, 2016 Fifteen years ago, the iPod and its iTunes music distribution system were born. No one saw how they were to transform Apple, enable the Smartphone 2.0 era, and unlock hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue for the company. Many of the facts surrounding the iPod’s birth and rise are well known. In The Perfect Thing, Steven Levy, one of the Valley’s best annalists (regular readers will note the spelling, this one is meliorative), lovingly and accurately chronicles how the iPod “became a full-blown cultural phenomenon, […] revolutionizing the way we experience music and radio.” Less lovingly, when Apple’s music player came out fifteen years ago, I quickly dismissed it as yet another MP3 player, one of many since the genre emerged in 1998. Incorrigible gadgeteer, I already owned several such devices including the popular Rio from Diamond Multimedia and one from SanDisk—which continues to make MP3 players to this day. This one will set you back $49.99 for 8 GB. By fixating on the iPod itself, I completely overlooked iTunes, introduced a few months earlier. I wasn’t alone in missing the forest for a tree: As popular as the iPod would become, no one imagined that it would be iTunes that would unleash Apple’s potential as it unlocked hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue and profit. With iTunes, Steve Jobs managed to break the back, for lack of a better word, of music “majors”—the content owners and distributors—by selling music “by the slice,” one song at a time. Apple’s co-founder would repeat this feat with cellular carriers, starting with AT&T, hypnotizing them into letting the iPhone manufacturer dictate configuration, pricing, and content distribution. (Sadly, unlocking and unbundling hasn’t worked as well for TV programs and streaming video distribution. One can hope…) The paramount iTunes/iPod innovation was micro-payments. Paying 99 cents online? No way. But Jobs convinced the credit card companies and, reportedly, allowed Apple to take losses on some iTunes transactions—only to sell more high-margin iPods. We can also mention in passing that iTunes was the first Apple app also made available on Windows, quickly followed by an Airport base station management client, if memory serves. The well-designed hardware/software iPod/iTunes combo quickly became ubiquitous, boosted by a clever, graphically minimalist, Jobs-like (if that’s the right word) Silhouette Advertising campaign. The white earphones and their wires became a status symbol that signaled one’s participation in a movement. Recall that when Jobs returned to the helm, Apple was struggling. In a PC market dominated by Windows, Apple’s market share hovered well below 5%. Many wondered if the company was doomed or, at best, destined to a marginal, insignificant role. The iPod changed how the company was perceived and the numbers followed: In 2006, the iPod generated more revenue than the Macintosh, $7.7 billion versus $7.4 billion. Apple was winning. A few months later, in Jan. 2007, Jobs announced the iPod’s descendant, the iPhone. Here, I don’t use the word descendant lightly. The knowledge accumulated in designing and manufacturing successive generations and varying sizes of iPods prepared Apple for its smartphone adventure. Those who initially dismissed the company’s entry into the handset manufacturing field failed to consider Apple’s iPod Supply Chain Management performance. With the advent of the iPhone, iTunes reemerges as an app distribution system and, no exaggeration, changes the smartphone world. One Valley wag contends that with its impact on the iPhone, iTunes caused Apple atheists to convert and believe in a Supreme Being looking out for them. Miraculously, the distribution infrastructure and payment system that had been developed for music instantly worked for iPhone apps. Apple understood that there’s no difference between the zeroes and ones of a song, and the bits of an app—it was their destination inside a device that mattered. “Boom!” as our dearly departed Grand Master would say, “It just works!” iTunes enabled the “app phone” era and unlocked hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue. Not bad for “yet another” MP3 player system. This post originally appeared at Monday Note. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

If you like the idea of spending big money on the Mac Pro with its umbrella holder style, you will want to hear this. Apple has cut the price of storage upgrades for buyers of the Mac Pro. The base amount of storage is still a 256GB PCIe-based flash device. Upgrades include 512GB or 1TB of the same type of storage media. Previously the 512GB upgrade added another $300-$400 to the price of the machine for entry-level units. The new price drop brings that 512GB storage upgrade to $200-$300 depending on which machine you are buying. If you want to step up to 1TB of storage that will cost you $600-$700 for the upgrade compared to the $800 price before the cut. Similar price cuts are available on the MacBook Air, iMac, Mac Mini, and the 2015 MacBook Pro. On the entry-level 27-inch iMac adding 512GB of storage used to run $500, with the new pricing in effect that will now cost $400. The mid-range imac can get 512GB of storage for $300 and 1TB for $700. The high-end iMac can be fitted with 1TB of storage for $100 less than the old pricing. Mac Mini pricing has dropped to $200 for 512GB and $600 for 1TB of storage. On 2015 MacBook Pro machines 512GB of flash storage is $200 and 1TB will cost you $600. The 13-inch MacBook upgrade pricing is $200 for 256GB, $400 for 512GB, and $800 for 1TB. If you are wondering, the iMac is tipped for a refresh in the first half of 2017 while there are no word on upgrades for Mac Pro or Mac Mini.

If you are, Apple has just launched its new MacBook Pro lineup, but safe to say that they are pretty expensive. If you’d rather not spend that money on a new laptop, there is some good news because Apple is actually dropping the prices of SSD upgrades for its older Mac lineup. What this means is that if you don’t mind using “older” technology, you will be able to trick it out with higher capacity SSD storage and not have to pay as much as before. The drop in prices are also pretty substantial and go up to $200. An example would be the 512GB SSD option which was set at around $300-400, while the 1TB option would cost customers $800-900. However according to the reports, it looks like they have since been discounted where the 512GB upgrade will cost around $200-$300, while the 1TB option has been discounted to $600-$700. Now the difference in prices will range depending on which model and which configuration you go with, but basically these are definitely cheaper than before. We’re not sure why Apple is discounting the SSD upgrades, but perhaps with the newer SSDs used in the new MacBook Pros, the older and slower models are now cheaper. Either way we guess this is good news so if you want to take advantage of that, hit up Apple’s website for the details. Filed in Apple >Computers.

But according to one analyst, it might be better to wait until 2017 to buy the new laptop. By Aaron Brown Aaron Brown PUBLISHED: 10:20, Wed, Nov 2, 2016 | UPDATED: 10:26, Wed, Nov 2, 2016 APPLEThose who want the latest MacBook Pro might do better to wait a year, according to one analyst Apple took the wraps off its redesigned MacBook Pro last week. The late 2016 MacBook Pro boasts a small touchscreen at the top of the keyboard that dynamically adapts to whatever app is currently on-screen, as well as a larger Force Touch trackpad, and improved display. Apple's latest MacBook Pro is powered by sixth-generation quad-core and dual-core processors, which bring up to 2.3 times the graphics performance over the previous generation, as well as faster SSDs and up to four Thunderbolt 3 ports. MacBook Pro also sports a Touch ID sensor that lets owners sign-in securely without a password and authenticate online transactions. But alongside the new additions, Apple has also dropped a number of iconic features from its latest laptop line-up. The new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar starts at £1,749 – a significant price increase over the previous generation. Meanwhile, the entry-level 15in MacBook Pro starts at £2,349. Apple MacBook Pro 2016 Launch Event Thu, October 27, 2016 Apple is holding its third product launch of 2016, and has unveiled three new MacBook Pros and a major update to Apple TV. Play slideshow GETTY 1 of 18 Apple MacBook Pro 2016 Launch Event But there could be good news on the horizon. Reliable Apple analyst King-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities predicts a price cut to the cutting-edge new MacBook within the next year. According to the note from KGI Securities, Apple will slash the price of its latest laptops following an internal hardware refresh next year. King-Chi Kuo notes that Apple tends to overprice at the start of a new MacBook generation before gradually lowering the price of the product as it matures. Because of this, Kuo believes Apple will announce lower prices for its MacBook line-up during the second half of next year. APPLEMacBook Pro owners can customise the key layout in the Touch Bar touchscreen In terms of specs, Kuo has indicated Apple will launch a new MacBook Pro with support for 32GB of RAM by the second-half of 2017. Apple Senior Vice President Of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller previously explained the company chose not to introduce a version of the MacBook Pro with 32GB of RAM because the power consumption required had a dismal effect on battery life. However, the next-generation Intel processors – dubbed Canonlake – should provide the power efficiency to accommodate this bump in RAM, King-Chi Kuo explains. If Intel fails to meet its deadline for the Cannonlake CPUs, Kuo has predicted Apple will opt for Coffee Lake processors instead. APPLETouch ID is now built into the MacBook Pro, making signing-in and authenticating payments a breeze Express.co.uk had the opportunity to test the latest generation MacBook last week, including the headline feature – the customisable Touch Bar. The multi-touch Retina display replaces the function keys on the MacBook Pro and aims to show users the controls they use the most. Touch Bar can display the system controls available on the function keys in previous generation notebooks – like volume and brightness controls. But unlike the traditional keys, the Touch Bar adapts and changes to the app you're using – bringing interactive ways to adjust or browse through content. For example, loading the Safari web browser triggers the Touch Bar to summon a slew of helpful shortcuts, including on-screen buttons to load new tabs, search the page, or refresh the page. Touch Bar also offers rich, colourful previews as you cycle through your open tabs.

One company wowed everyone. The other produced a snooze-fest. Can you guess which was which? You probably guessed wrong. Because Apple, long associated with the creative romance of Steve Jobs, was the tech giant whose new product elicited a collective shrug. And it was Microsoft that stole a move out of the Apple playbook, dazzling high-end, creative-class consumers like photographers, business analysts, media designers, architects, and music producers. Microsoft unveiled several new products, but the big one was the Surface Studio — a 28-inch, extremely-high-resolution touchscreen tablet that doubles as a desktop PC screen. There's also the Surface Dial, which can be placed on the Studio's screen and rotated to select menu items, and a new software package of 3D design and imaging tools. As Hayley Tsukayama observed at The Washington Post, the Studio is really just a super-sized version of the Surface Books product that Microsoft has been selling for years; two-in-one devices that double as a touchscreen tablet and laptop. But if you've ever watched science-fiction movies like Minority Report or Iron Man — where Tom Cruise or Robert Downey Jr. seem to manipulate images and data hanging in mid-air by grabbing them, spreading their fingers to zoom in on details, and sending files and information sliding from one folder to another with a flick of the fingers — you can see how Microsoft is trying to conjure hints of the same experience. Touchscreens certainly aren't a breakthrough, but the Studio seems like what we always imagined touchscreen technology could be like. "The Surface Studio looks like the kind of device Apple has been known for: fresh and bold in its design, and geared toward creative professionals," Seth Lewis, a professor of journalism and media innovation at the University of Oregon, told the Christian Science Monitor. Meanwhile, Apple's new offerings amounted to some workmanlike upgrades for its Apple TV, new MacBook Pros that boast a bit less bulk and a bit more performance than before, and a new touchscreen bar on laptop keyboards where function keys used to be. "Speaking to analysts after its event," Tsukayama wrote, "it seemed that 'current MacBook Pro owners looking to upgrade' was the main audience Apple was going for." So what's going on? In many ways, Apple is shifting to appeal more to the average consumers who have always gravitated to Microsoft hardware for reasons of practicality and affordability. And Microsoft is shifting to target the high-end professionals Apple has historically been associated with. You can even see this in the companies' dueling ad campaigns: Microsoft's ads emphasize imagination and creativity, and even crib music from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, while Apple's commercials feature chief design officer Jony Ive's laidback and professional British accent explaining all the highly technical ways Apple has improved the performance and convenience of its MacBooks. The latter is pretty, but it's also relentlessly practical. Ironically, it may have been Steve Jobs himself who ultimately put Apple on this course by shifting the company's focus back toward consumer products like the iPhone. And certainly, that drove a remarkable change throughout society, transforming the smartphone from a luxury buy into a commonly owned item. But the iPhone has remained the luxury buy within that market, with smartphones from other companies stepping in to fill the needs of the mass of consumers. So Apple is trying to conquer the world of devices and laptops from the top down, starting with the high-end market and moving on to appeal to a broader base of consumers. Microsoft, having already solidified itself within the bigger low-end market, is now attempting the reverse with a bottom-up strategy. Will these gambits succeed? Time will tell...

Microsoft Surface Dial vs Apple Touch Bar: who's leading the way in innovation? By David Nield   New laptop add-ons all round Shares Microsoft and Apple both have new laptops on show and both have a rather special add-on too: the versatile Surface Dial in Microsoft's case and the Touch Bar extension that now sits above the keyboard and trackpad on the higher-end 2016 MacBook Pros models. There's a lot more to the new Surfaces and MacBook Pros than these accessories, of course, but with both these innovations appearing at almost the same time they give us a useful way of comparing just how forward-thinking these two tech giants are right now. Microsoft and Apple's new hardware How fast and how well Microsoft and Apple are innovating isn't just down to the Surface Dial and the Touch Bar, but they're useful points of reference: both new add-ons designed to kickstart fresh interest in the traditional computer form factor. It's perhaps no coincidence that Apple and Microsoft both announced product refreshes within two days of each other - Apple has obviously been at the hardware game for a lot longer, but the Surface Pros and Surface Books and Surface Studios that Microsoft now has are going to become increasingly important to the company in the future. The Touch Bar was part of a long-overdue update to the MacBook Pro line - faster processors, a thinner and lighter design, and support for Touch ID (thanks to the Touch Bar, of which more in a moment). Meanwhile, over in Microsoft's part of the world, it gave us a new Surface Studio and an updated Surface Book, with more power and better battery life. Microsoft also showed off a new peripheral called the Surface Dial, which will work with the Studio, Surface Pro 4, and Surface Books. What is the Surface Dial? The puck-shaped, Bluetooth-enabled Surface Dial drops on top of a Surface Studio, Surface Pro 4 or Surface Book touchscreen and brings up a variety of context-sensitive options depending on the application running underneath. One of the example uses Microsoft has showed off was a digital artist using the Surface Dial to bring up a colour palette, changing the brush colour without having to open up a menu or select it using the Surface Pen. Like the Touch Bar, though, it's still early days for the Surface Dial - it can be used to do pretty much anything app developers want to do with it, but we might not see a lot of integrations straight away. You can also use the Surface Dial on a desktop to twist settings like volume or brightness or playback speed up and down. Again, it depends what developers have planned. The Surface Dial comes as a separate accessory which will set you back $99, and pre-orders are now open. As yet there's no word on a UK release date or price, but that works out at roughly £81. What is the Touch Bar? The Touch Bar is an integrated accessory - you get it with the newest 15-inch MacBook Pros and as an option on the newest 13-inch models too. Like the Surface Dial, its uses can change depending on the application on screen, and in fact some of the use cases are the same: quickly flicking through a series of photos, for example, or adjusting the volume with a tap in applications like Spotify. Developers digging deeper into the new Touch Bar code have found it's basically an adapted Apple Watch system, allowing you to drop in emojis or select sections of a video clip. Touch ID integration is included too for unlocking your Mac with a finger press. As with the Surface Dial, it's up to those coding the applications to decide exactly how it's used (though Apple has issued guidelines, as you would expect). Microsoft has already been showing off some ideas about how the Touch Bar will work with Office: you get shortcuts to text formatting options, PowerPoint presentation controls, Excel formulas and more. It looks the part too - Apple has done a good job of integrating the Touch Bar unobtrusively in the overall keyboard layout. Surface Dial vs Touch Bar To give credit to Microsoft and Apple, both the Surface Dial and the Touch Bar are stylish-looking bits of kit that are sure to appeal to many a laptop user in the coming years, irrespective of their choice of OS. The Surface Dial - being an external accessory - is more flexible and looks to have more potential with its ability to dial up and down and click (and double-click). We think it's going to really change the way some people use their computers, but it might not appeal to many outside the creative industries. The Touch Bar is perhaps less exciting but more useful to the average MacBook Pro user. It's a more conventional idea (keyboard buttons you can reprogram) but that also makes it more handy in all of the apps you're going to be using day to day, even if you're not in graphic design or a similar job. Ultimately the onus is on the developers to show us what the Surface Dial and Touch Bar can do - and how innovative they really can be - but we're looking forward to giving them both a whirl in the years ahead.
