Which has the better specs? Erwin Cruz Aug 21, 2016 12:01 AM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (Microsoft)A promotional photo for the Microsoft Surface Pro 4. As of late, two of the tech industry's leaders, Microsoft and Apple have remained silent for quite some time now about their much talked about devices. Microsoft is said to be currently working on their Surface Pro 5 which is slated for a 2017 reveal, while Apple is all set to finally launch their latest MacBook Pro next month together with the iPhone 7. Given this, consumers are now beginning to muse on which among these two ultraportable devices will emerge as the crowd favorite when they go head on in the near future. According to reports, Washington-based Microsoft is said to have moved the release date of their Surface Pro 5 to 2017 due to some new features that that they want to add into the device, not to mention that the company is also waiting for the release of Intel's successor to the Skylake, the Kaby Lake processor, which is slated to be out next year as well. In addition, Microsoft is said to be working on a major upgrade for the Windows 10 operating system dubbed Redstone 2 which is said to be another milestone for the current OS. (Apple)A screenshot of the current MacBook Pro. Meanwhile, Apple's MacBook Pro 2016 could finally be dished out this coming month and it might still have the Skylake chipset for its processor, unless they follow what Microsoft's Surface Pro 5 is doing. Moreover, it is said that it might carry the company's latest operating system known as the macOS Sierra together with the once iPhone exclusive, Siri. The notebook is also speculated to don the much-requested OLED touch bar which could spell a higher cost for the upcoming device. The next MacBook Pro might also boast of 4K capabilities and might be tapping the services of either AMD or NVIDIA in providing the notebook's graphics processing unit (GPU). Pricing for both devices have yet to be disclosed by their respective companies and fans might want to check both Apple and Microsoft's websites for the latest updates on their new and upcoming hardware.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple Maps has come a long way since its disastrous launch back in 2012, but the Cupertino company still has plenty of room to improve. Three Apple patents published recently show how the firm continues to work on its mapping app, and hints at a few features that might be in development. The first patent describes a system for rendering 3D maps in data-less areas. Apple says it can achieve this by pulling data from nearby areas to create a detailed 3D map. A second patent dives into how the company could create 3D models by combining multiple data sets. For example, Apple Maps would use the 2D footprints of buildings along with 3D data for their heights to create an accurate rendering. Finally, a third patent shows how Apple Maps could combine satellite maps with additional data for a “hybrid” view. The app’s current satellite view already layers on some data, but this version could include even more information. Apple lists points-of-interest and road indicators as potential new features, along with current options like the names for street, cities, states and bodies of water. All three of these patents are at least a few years old, and it’s likely Apple’s already integrated many of these ideas into Maps and abandoned other concepts entirely. Still, it’s interesting to see how the company has continued to improve Apple Maps since it first launched along with some of the ways the app could continue to advance moving forward.

Vine Report HOME U.S. SCIENCE/HEALTH WORLD ENTERTAINMENT TECH LIFE&STYLE Subscriptions Home TECH iOS 10 beta 6 releases for developers and beta 5 for public Louise Arriola Aug 19, 2016 10:48 PM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (Apple)Apple teases the iOS 10 in this promotional image Apple just rolled out the iOS 10 beta 6 for developers and the beta 5 for the public beta testers this Monday, bringing improvements on Siri and redesigned apps. According to 9to5Mac, the iOS 10 beta 6 introduces a new face for the News and Music apps, and the widgets for the Lock and Home screens. There is a new Home app for HomeKit, and new iMessage features are also added along with tons of new additions. The iOS 10 beta 6 is only available for developers, but the public can now get ahold of the iOS 10 beta 5. To download the latest beta of the upcoming iOS 10, interested users have to sign up for Apple's beta program. Those who have already signed up can download it over-the-air (OTA). The iOS 10 beta 5 features minor improvements such as a new lock sound and louder keyboard clicks. Other new features are discussed in the video by 9to5Mac below. Many developers noted that this might be the last beta to be released by Apple for the next iOS, iDigitalTimes reported. There are rumors that Apple is planning an event in the first week of September, reportedly on Sept. 7, when the next-generation iPhone is expected to be unveiled along with the final version of the iOS 10. The new iPhone 7, 7 Plus, the rumored 7 Pro and operating system (OS) are then expected to be available the week after or more specifically, Sept. 14. However, Apple has not officially announced an event or a date, so they are just rumors for now and therefore should be taken with a grain of salt. The iOS 10 beta 6 for developers and beta 5 for the public can already be downloaded and tested on the iPhone 5, 5c, 5s and up to the latest, iPad 4, iPad Air 1 and 2, iPad Pro 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch, iPad Mini 2 and up, and the sixth generation of the iPod Touch.

Supratim Adhikari The Australian 2:25PM August 19, 2016 Save Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on email Share more... Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Whatsapp Print this articleX Supratim Adhikari Technology Editor Melbourne @SupratimA The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has held off from giving permission to a consortium of Australian banks hoping to collectively bargain with Apple and get their digital wallets onto iPhones. The competition watchdog has decided against granting the consortium — which includes Commonwealth Bank, Westpac and National Australia Bank — an interim authorisation, citing that it needs more time to consider the matter. “Given the complexity of the issues and the limited time available, the ACCC has decided not to grant interim authorisation at this time,” the regulator’s chairman Rod Sims said. “The ACCC requires more time to consult and consider the views of industry, consumers, and other interested parties.” The regulator will now release a draft decision in October after conducting wider consultation with the industry and consumers. Apple had pushed the regulator to delay any judgement on the matter to accommodate the 6-month statutory period of assessment, as it gets ready to take on the banks. More: How Apple, ANZ struck deal ANZ is the only one of the big four banks that has struck a deal with the iPhone maker, sacrificing a chunk of the interchange fees in a bid to win first mover advantage. Meanwhile, the likes of CBA, NAB and Westpac, along with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, have decided on a more antagonistic approach, appealing to the ACCC to let them bargain with Apple to gain access to the Near Field Communications (NFC) antenna- which allows contactless payment - on iPhones and get their digital wallets loaded onto the smartphones. While financial institutions have been able to provide contactless options on Android phones, Apple’s iOS has been a closed ecosystem. Apple has so far categorically refused to accommodate the banks, lashing out against the ‘cartel’ and its push to dictate terms to the US technology giant. However, the banks have received support from some unexpected quarters with some of the challengers to the traditional banking industry siding with the consortium. Payment platform provider Tyro, a regular critic of the big four, said in its submission that Apple must open access to its NFC technology. “It’s in the Australian public interest to maintain choice for consumers, merchants and banks as to mobile wallet solutions and the applications that they enable,” Tyro said in its submission to the ACCC. “Eliminating third party access to the Apple NFC function is particularly effective in stifling innovation and competition, because it is the only available and highly secure connectivity option that is ubiquitously available across the entire card payment infrastructure and terminal fleet.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on email Share more...

Wednesday November 23, 2016 US WORLD PERSECUTION MINISTRY CULTURE VIDEO Subscriptions Homepage CULTURE iPad Pro update, latest rumor: Three new iPad models may arrive in 2017 including a 10.5-inch iPad Pro Catherine Salvador 17 August, 2016 11:42 PM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (REUTERS/Stephen Lam)The new iPad Pro on display during an event at the Apple headquarter, Cupertino, California. iPad enthusiasts are always on the lookout for latest news about the release of a new model and alleged sources say that Apple is planning to launch three iPad models to add to the iPad lineup in 2017. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that the iPad may most probably have a conservative improvement on its hardware by 2017 as Apple is reportedly planning to launch three future models, which almost have similar designs with the previous models. The anticipated 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2 may come along with a 10.5-inch model and it may be priced more expensive than the low-cost model version of the 9.7-inch iPad. It is also speculated that the 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2 and 10.5-inch variant will be run by an A10X processor, utilizing 10nm process technology that will be solely supplied by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Mac Rumors reported. Kuo further predicted the possibility of the Cupertino tech company positioning the 10.5-inch iPad Pro as an alternative choice to the 9.7-inch model. In an article by Apple Insider, the current flagship model, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, is installed with the A9X, which implies that the next model will already be run by the A10X and launched in 2018. Meanwhile, most fans are still checking out the alleged iPad Pro 2's leaked specs, which were shown on Apple Insider. An anonymous source who apparently works at an Apple supplier in China showed two images of the supposed upcoming device. It shows the tablet's settings written in Chinese characters, though the publication noticed that the model number is different from what Apple usually use for their previous and current iPad models. However, they did spot that the number system is similar to the traditional numbering method of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro.

Rachael Marifosque |Saturday, August 20 2016 Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin it (REUTERS/Michaela Rehle)Various rumors about the iPad Air 3 keep coming out. When Apple announced a new addition to its tablet line, consumers were surprised when instead of the iPad Air 3, the company revealed the iPad Pro. Should users still hope for an Air 3 or is it the end of the line for the Air family? Loyal Apple followers were surprised when the normally predictable company deviated from its usual schedule and unveiled the iPad Pro and the iPad mini 4 during its September press briefing last year. What made the move even more bewildering for some was the lack of a midsize iPad Air. That and the revelation of the iPad Pro 9.7 inches had people wondering what happened to the iPad Air 3 and led to speculations that the Cupertino-based company is retiring the Air line. Despite speculations that consumers might soon be bidding the iPad Air line adieu, the rumor mill still keeps churning out news about the Air 3. Its been reported that the iPad Air 3 will be thinner and will be utilizing the 7000-series aluminum, which is notable for being bend-proof. It will allegedly also have a Smart Connector, which will allow users to connect the tablet to accessories like the Apple Pen and Keyboard. Another rumor that has come out is that the iPad Air will have a "digital crown," similar to what the Apple Watch has. The news allegedly came from a patent application that was recently published. It has also been said that if the iPad Air 3 does come out, it will probably be available in the four colors that iPhones are available in — Gold, Rose Gold, Silver, and Space Grey. It might also have an A9X chip and a rear LED flash. Of course, it goes without saying that these are just some of the rumors surrounding the iPad Air 3 and should be taken with a grain of salt.

Apple unveiled the new iPad Air 2 tablet, iPad Mini 3 and a Retina iMac. (Justin Sullivan/Getty) There have been rumors that the iPad Mini 5 will no longer be included in the upcoming 2017 iPad launch. However, there have been speculations that the mentioned model will instead be renamed as the iPad Pro Mini. Ming-Chi Kuo, a securities analyst has once again aired his take on the upcoming launch of iPad models next year. He said that Apple will probably release two iPad Pro sizes, the new 10.5 inch and the 12.9 inch. The Cupertino Company will also launch in 2017 a budget priced 9.7 inch iPad Pro model. The analyst made no mention of any iPad Mini 5 coming up next year. Some industry observers speculate that the iPhone plus models may have offered stiff competition to the iPad Mini, according to Mac Rumors. The report suggests that Apple is trimming the number of its iPad models which possibly includes the iPad Mini and iPad Air lines in order to improve its sales and eliminate any competition between its various products. Kuo however, is pessimistic that Apple's 2017 sales figures will improve. He said that the only way for Apple to recover its finances is by launching smartphones and tablets that will capture the fancy of its customers. The analyst thinks that such scenario is possible in 2018. Still, there are others who think that the iPad Mini 5 will be repackaged as the smallest version of the iPad Pro series, according to PC Advisor. Such rumor is possible considering that the iPad Mini is about 7.9 inch. The iPad Mini 4 was released on September last year. Some are speculating or hoping that any upcoming iPad Mini 5 or anything close to it will be launched this September. Unfortunately, Apple has not yet officially confirmed if it is indeed shutting down the iPad Mini model. The iPad Min 4 though, is still available for sale.

Published in News Apple may be planning 10.5-inch iPad Pro in 2017 by Jon Worrel on18 August 2016 Tweet font size decrease font size increase font size Print Email New middle option between 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch models Over the weekend, highly reputable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo released a new research report claiming that the company may be planning to release a “middle-sized” 10.5-inch iPad Pro sometime in 2017 to accompany the existing 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch models. Kuo expects to see three new iPads emerging in 2017. The first will be a refresh to the existing flagship 12.9-inch iPad Pro and may be called the 12.9-inch “iPad Pro 2.” The second will be a new, low-cost 9.7-inch iPad that will likely replace the iPad Air 2 launched in October 2014. Apple is in a predicament in the 9.7-inch tablet market right now, as it currently offers the iPad Air 2 for a base price of $399 (16GB Wi-Fi only) while also offering the 9.7-inch iPad Pro for a base price of $599 (32GB Wi-Fi only). Based on Kuo’s “low-cost” prediction, it’s possible that the company may demote its future 9.7-inch device to “non-Pro” status and position the new 10.5-inch and refreshed 12.9-inch model as new “iPad Pro 2” units. Alternatively, the other option is that Apple will offer both a standard 9.7-inch model with new 10nm A10 SoC along with a refreshed 9.7-inch iPad Pro with new 10nm A10X chip, but this has yet to be confirmed. Apple’s first generation iPad Pro was originally launched with a 12.9-inch display size in November 2015 and a $799 USD base price (32GB Wi-Fi only), followed by a 9.7-inch model in March 2016 for $599. Both devices use Apple’s custom 16nm A9X SoC developed by TSMC with 1.8 times more CPU performance and two times more GPU performance as its 2014 predecessor, the Apple A8X. 35 to 40 million iPads expected to ship this year The reputable Apple analyst has also downgraded his iPad shipment forecast for the remainder of the year from 45 to 50 million units down to 35 to 40 million units. He says the conservative forecast revision reflects a lack of Apple releasing any new models before the end of the year, along with other general trends in the tablet market.  “Revolutionary” iPad refresh expected in 2018 Kuo’s notes further claim that Apple may launch a more groundbreaking refresh of its iPad lineup in 2018 at the earliest, suggesting the possibility of a flexible AMOLED display panel along with other noteworthy form factor changes. Highlights from Kuo’s notes can be found here.

Photo: Jim Merithew/Cult of Mac The next-generation Apple Watch won’t totally cut ties with the iPhone when it launches later this fall. Although Apple plans to add a number of much-needed features to the Apple Watch 2, a new report claims the company hit roadblocks when trying to make a major change that would have added LTE or other cellular data connection capabilities to the device. “The company still plans to announce new watch models this fall boasting improvements to health tracking,” reports Bloomberg. “The updated versions will also be able to integrate GPS-based location tracking.” The lack of GPS has been one of the biggest complaints against the Apple Watch, which requires runners and cyclists to carry their iPhones with them during a workout to get an accurate reading of how far they’ve gone. Apple has reportedly been in talks with mobile phone carriers this year to add cellular connectivity to Apple Watch, which would allow wearers to download emails, maps, sports score alerts and more without an iPhone. Executives at Apple supposedly told carriers that the earliest it could ship cellular Apple Watch models would have been December of this year, so the company pushed the feature to a future model. The cause of the delay is allegedly related to battery life. Batteries would drain much faster if a cellular chip were added to the watch. Considering less-than-stellar battery life is one of the other big complaints against the Apple Watch, it’s probably a good thing Apple is saying no to LTE for now.

Twitter: @bst3r. Deals of the Day See all deals Rob This is simple. The battery in the Apple Watch is a fraction of the size of the one in the iPhone, if you added a radio to the Apple Watch the battery would be dead in no time. This is simple common sense and its a little shocking that the media is even wrestling with this topic, as if this is actually news worthy. When batteries can be made that can hold a full days charge with the use of a full-time radio, only then will LTE find its way into the watch. #duhhhh xav77 They could also make the watch bigger matthewdbenson Agreed, but media just reporting on what people want to hear – ‘battery life’ and ‘separation from phone’ were the two of the major gripes about first Apple Watch News How-To Reviews App Business Deals Buyback Podcast Magazine About Advertising Privacy Most popular Latest Posts Deal of the Day See all the latest Cult of Mac Deals.

If you were hoping for a way to untether your Apple Watch from your iPhone and use it as a standalone devicecomplete with cellular connectivity to whatever carrier you subscribe toyou might want to abandon these Dick Tracy-like dreams. According to the latest rumors, the next version of the Apple Watch (whatever that happens to be, and whenever it happens to come out) isn't going to come with this feature. And there's a very good reason for that: allegedly, a permanent cell connection drains the battery too much. According to a recent report from Bloomberg, Apple was allegedly working on such a feature for a new iteration of the Apple Watch in the hope that it would allow owners to decouple their two devices. You'd be able to walk to the grocery store and still have an updated shopping list on your Apple Watch even if you left your iPhone in the car (or at home), for example. And while it's rumored that the new Apple Watches the company is likely to announce this fall will have some new hardware featuresincluding more health monitoring and GPS-based location trackingthey won't feature a cellular connection. //Related Articles Report: Apple Watch 2 With GPS, Better Battery Coming This Year The inherent problem with Apple's plan is that the chips that would allow an Apple Watch to use a cellular connection drain too much of the device's battery. And even if Apple wanted to go that routewhich it likely does not, given existing concerns over smartwatch battery lifeit wouldn't have been able to manufacture and ship new cellular-connecting Apple Watches until December at the earliest. So, the decision seems to have been made that cell connectivityand chips that use less of a power draw to get therewill have to go in another Apple Watch update. It's possible you might see this kind of feature in a third-generation device, and it would be fair to speculate that one of those might come out next year. Don't hold us, or Apple, to that prediction, however. You know how these things go. Current rumors suggest Apple's second-generation smartwatch will debut at the company's upcoming event on September 6. Expect to be able to preorder and/or receive the Apple Watch II (or whatever Apple calls it) shortly after its big reveal. You'll likely be able to pick up a brand-new iPhone to go with it, too...

In fact, one piece of trivia that hardcore Seinfeld fans likely already know is that a Mac can be seen in nearly every episode of the show, more often than not in Jerry's apartment on his desk. With that in mind, some gentle genius decided to put together a virtual tour of Jerry's Mac, which was typically a Mac SE/30 model. In later years, Jerry was prone to using a PowerBook Duo and Apple's ill-fated 20th Anniversary Mac. All that said, if you hop on over to Extremelygoodshit and click on the "View Issue Two" link in the middle of the page, you'll be magically transported to the screen of Jerry's Mac, running System 7 and all. DON'T MISS: T-Mobile kills data plans and goes all in on unlimited data Pictured below is what the homescreen looks like. Clearly, whoever put this together did their homework as they expertly captured every last detail of what System 7 on the Mac looked like back in the early to mid 90s. seinfeld homescreen macMore Even better, every icon on the screen is clickable and has its own sequence of jokes lurking beneath the surface. For instance, if you double click on the trash icon, you're presented with this view. And if you yourself have had enough of Trump et. al, you can go ahead and empty the trash. seinfeld trash virtual tourMore Curious about what type of files are lurking within Seinfeld's 'Documents' folder? Well, there you can take a look at some of his jokes in progress, his grocery list, and even a comical concept draft for Bee Movie. Again, everything is clickable so make sure to explore every document fully. You shan't be disappointed. seinfeld documentsMore We don't want to spoil it all, but we have to mention that every single folder and file is worth opening up and exploring fully, even Seinfeld's presumably boring Tax Forms folder. There are quite a few Easter Eggs that are hilariously done and well worth checking out. Without question, this virtual tour of Seinfeld's ancient Mac is the best thing you'll see on the web today.

She’s unlikely to accept any more such offers. “I’ve come to realize that most of my cards are useless,” said the 30-year-old Hong Kong nurse. “I basically use only one card, for shopping and travel booking online.” The shifting attitude of Asian consumers such as Chiu is upending the economics of the credit-card industry, and banks like Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and Standard Chartered Plc are taking note. The banks, which increasingly rely on the region’s swelling number of affluent people to drive profits, are slashing the number of card products they offer in Asia and focusing instead on getting a smaller range of cards adopted for online payments. In Asia more than elsewhere, consumers are increasing card spending while jettisoning some of their plastic. At 18 percent last year, regional growth in credit-card payments was double the global rate, data from London-based Retail Banking Research show. Yet the actual number of cards in circulation fell in Asia last year even as the worldwide tally increased, RBR estimates. And that was before Apple Inc. began rolling out its mobile-device payment system Apple Pay in Asia. “The real game now is to get your card to be the one that sits behind the payment platform,” said Keith Pogson, a senior partner at Ernst & Young LLP. “The customer doesn’t change it. They make a decision once about which card numbers they are going to use in the system. That decision for the bank is critical because it gives them an enormous trade flow of those transactions.” Culling Cards To capture the business, it no longer makes sense for the banks to issue multiple credit-card products in the hopes of maximizing usage, especially at a time when they are under pressure to save money. Instead, they are trying to focus on promoting a smaller number of cards, using more targeted benefits such as airline mileage programs and touting the digital features. “What we are trying to do in Asia is to actively and aggressively reduce the number of products with fewer, more powerful and better products,” said Sergio Zanatti, head of Asia-Pacific cards and personal loans at Citigroup. “The amount of complexity that you need to manage them just grows and makes our operations more complex.” Citigroup has slashed its number of card offerings in Asia from 270 to just over 100, in line with the 60 percent reduction in global card products, Zanatti said. That contributed to the 12 percent drop in operating expenses at Citigroup’s consumer-banking operations in Asia last year. Asia accounted for almost a fifth of Citigroup’s global consumer-banking profit in the first half of this year, the largest contribution outside North America. Asian revenues from Citigroup-branded cards were second only to North America. Apple Pay HSBC, which has posted billboards all over central Hong Kong to promote its tie-up with Apple Pay, says its number of active mobile-banking clients in the city has jumped almost 50 percent over the past three years -- and predicts offerings such as Apple Pay will keep that figure rising. The bank has been offering cash rebates to its cardholders when they make contactless payments at certain retailers in Hong Kong, including through a tie-up with 7-Eleven to promote chicken meals. “In the world of Apple Pay or Google, consumers will use cards in different ways and we need to ensure our cards and reward programs align with these changing needs,” said Kevin Martin, HSBC’s Asia-Pacific head of retail banking and wealth management. HSBC is redeploying as much as $150 billion of assets to Asia and adding some 4,000 jobs in China’s Pearl River Delta region with a focus on retail banking and wealth management. The bank, which generates most of its profits from Asia, is preparing to launch its first own-brand credit card in China later this year. Alipay, Tencent For Standard Chartered, Asia accounted for close to 70 percent of its operating income in the first half. The London-based bank said earlier this year it had more than 100,000 applications for a new credit card offering air miles and the Apple Pay service in Hong Kong. Reducing the number of credit-card offerings has the added benefit of keeping costs in check. “With fewer, more standard products and a global digital infrastructure, you also have fewer errors and much less risk -- this also reduces costs,” said Karen Fawcett, Standard Chartered’s retail banking chief executive officer. Millions of Asians are starting to use credit cards as they join the middle class -- and in many cases, almost simultaneously adopting the mobile payment services offered by the likes of Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s finance affiliate. China’s Tencent has 700-million-plus users on its WeChat messaging platform, where it offers financial services including payments. Alipay has about 450 million users. “The bigger banks are in attack mode trying to get more customers to use their cards online,” said Gary Ng, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP who specializes in banking and financial services. “The more cash-based transactions move online, the more likely it is the banks can generate fee income and interest income.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The company also announced it completed its acquisition of a stake in Sharp after gaining approval from Chinese authorities. Apple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. The New Taipei City, Taiwan-based Foxconn, which jointly designs and makes products with electronics manufacturers around the world, said net income in the three months through June 30 fell to NT$17.7 billion ($541 million) from NT$25.7 billion a year earlier. As a consequence, diluted earnings per share dropped to NT$1.02 from NT$1.63 per share. Sales in the quarter dropped to NT$922.1 billion from NT$972.7 billion.

The company enjoyed notable growth in 2015, but sales started to crumble from December. Foxconn, best known as a supplier to Apple, manufactures parts, modules and system assemblies for computers, communication, and consumer electronics. According to its disclosure, 54.8% of its net sales came from one customer as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2016 but it did not identify the customer, while its second biggest customer generated 8.9% of sales. Foxconn shares advanced 1.01%, while Hon Hai shares dropped 3.7% in Taiwan. Separately, the company on Friday completed its acquisition of a stake in Sharp, according to the troubled Japanese electronics maker. The purchase was made immediately after the Anti-Monopoly Bureau of China's Ministry of Commerce approved the transaction. In March, Foxconn said it would pay ¥388.8 billion ($3.8 billion) for Sharp. Foxconn and its subsidiaries have taken a 66% stake in Sharp. Sharp shares soared 19.1% on Friday, after the announcement.  Foxconn had beaten out a rival ¥300 billion offer from Innovation Network Corporation of Japan. The public-private backed fund, known as INCJ, wanted to break up Sharp and add its flat panel business into Japan Display  . Japan Display was established in 2012 through a merger of the LCD operations of Sony , Hitachi   and Toshiba  , which INCJ financed. Earlier this week, it was reported that Japan Display, also an Apple supplier, is seeking financial support from INCJ, its largest shareholder as a slowdown in iPhone sales has forced the company to carry more inventories.
News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Unlikely reunion: Cousins meet again over coffee in Apple Valley after 70 years Saturday Aug 13, 2016 at 12:01 AM Aug 13, 2016 at 12:22 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — Army veteran Donald Harris said he doesn’t know if it was coincidence or divine intervention that brought him and his cousin together after almost seven decades. The 83-year-old Harris told the Daily Press that he met his long-lost cousin, Harvey Stanley, 79, about two weeks ago at Mega Tom’s restaurant on Bear Valley Road in Apple Valley. “We were both born in Starks, Louisiana, a very small town with about 40 to 50 folks,” said Harris, as he sipped his coffee inside the eatery. “I about fell over when Harvey told me that he was also born in Starks.” Harris and Stanley said they were both equally shocked when they discovered that Walter Harris was their uncle after they began discussing names of residents who lived in the small bayou town about 40 miles north of the Gulf of Mexico and three miles from the Texas border. “You have to realize that Starks is a tiny spot on the map, with about 10,000 mosquitoes for every person,” said Stanley, a Navy veteran who served in the Pacific. “I think they recently had a population boom and Starks has about 600 people living there now.” Harris said he left Louisiana at age six and visited a few times before age 10. He remembers playing with a lot of kids on his Uncle Walter’s farm, but doesn’t remember names or playing with Stanley. He added that, "with Starks being so small, we probably did cross paths at one time or another when we grew up." The cousins also discovered that they've been living about four blocks away from each other in Apple Valley for the last 20 years, something Harris calls, “A coincidence that is beyond comprehension.” “About six months ago, we saw this guy who was about our age group sitting at a different table inside Mega Tom’s,” Harris said. “We asked him if he’d like to join our group that meets about three times a week at the restaurant.” With Harris having served in Korea, his girlfriend, Sheree Merrone, said Stanley’s Korea Veteran baseball cap caught her attention as the couple invited Stanley to join the senior group. “Two weeks ago, we were at Tom’s without our group and we bumped into Harvey,” Harris said. “We finally had a chance to get a word in edgewise without the group. We started a conversation and that’s when we found out we were related.” Merrone said she believes “Jesus brought the cousins together” and restaurant waitress Maria Pinkney remarked that the chances of Harris and Stanley meeting was “pretty astronomical,” considering how the duo’s life journey has taken them in different directions over the years. Harris moved to California as a child when his father, who worked for Santa Fe railroad, was transferred to Barstow where an 8-year old Harris grew up and made money as a shoeshine boy at the Harvey House. “I used to shine shoes when the troop trains came through town,” Harris said. “That was back in 1941, just after World War II started.” As a teenager, the young Harris joined the Army and was stationed in Japan and Korea in the early ‘50s. After his time in the military, Harris returned to Barstow, then spent the next 40 years moving to Alaska, Denver, Missouri, Northern California, Oregon, Florida and Arizona. “I moved to Apple Valley in 1998, built a couple of houses and spent a lot of time traveling by motorcycle,” Harris said. “I met Sheree in 2004 and we’ve been together ever since.” After growing up on a cattle farm and riding bulls, Stanley said he quit school at age 17 and headed to California where he joined the Navy and met his wife, Charlotte, who lived in Downey. “He met my parents and on my 16th birthday we went to the Pike in Long Beach,” Charlotte Stanley said. “That’s when he decided that he was going to marry me. We met in September 1955 and got married three months later.” Charlotte Stanley, who grew up near the historic McDonald’s restaurant on the corner of Lakewood Boulevard and Florence Avenue in Downey, said she still remembers the couple ordering 15-cent burgers at the third restaurant franchised by Richard and Maurice McDonald, who founded the chain in 1948. Harvey Stanley said he shipped out to sea and returned home just before the couple’s first daughter was born. After he was discharged in 1957, the couple spent the next 30 years living Downey, Louisiana, Lucerne Valley, the Los Angeles area before finally moving to Apple Valley in 1987. While the couples enjoyed breakfast at Mega Tom’s, Charlotte Stanley and Merrone began chatting and quickly discovered they both lived near the Downey McDonald’s. For a brief moment, the couples thought another family connection was about to occur. Harris and Stanley told the Daily Press they have a lot of “catching up to do” and the couples have many “double dates” planned. “When we first met, we started having coffee as friends, now we're having coffee as family," Harris said. “I guess coming together after all these years was just meant to be.” Rene Ray De La Cruz may be reached at 760-951-6227, RDeLa Cruz@VVDailyPress.com or on Twitter @DP_ReneDeLaCruz.

That means September is almost here. And with September come certain, well, certainties. NFL football returns. And not soon enough. The fall TV season starts. Apple will hold an iPhone-related event. OK, so officially, Apple hasn’t said it’s going to do anything around the iPhone sometime early next month. But let’s be serious. Apple has done one of these events every September for several years now, and at every one of those, the company has shown off a new version of the iPhone. I would bet that Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook will resign tomorrow and say he is becoming Ryan Lochte’s public relations manager before I would think Apple won’t unveil the so-called iPhone 7 in a few weeks. When Apple does that, it will get a lot of attention as always happens when a new iPhone comes out. It may even get a boost in iPhone sales, which would be a good thing, to say the least, as year-over-year sales of the iPhone have gone down for each of the past two quarters. And it may need that, boost, too, as it’s facing more competition from an impressive rival in Samsung. On Thursday, technology research firm Gartner put out a new report on the state of the smartphone market, and if you didn’t know any better, you would think that you were looking at the contrasting states of the Seattle Seahawks (Samsung) and the San Francisco 49ers (Apple). During the second quarter of this year, Gartner said total worldwide smartphone sales rose just 4.3 percent from a year ago, to 344.4 million units. Apple came in second place, with 44.4 million iPhones sold, but that was 7.7 percent less than the 48.09 million iPhones it shipped a year ago. Samsung? It sold 76.7 million of its Galaxy brand and other phones during the quarter, which was 6.4 percent more that last year’s second quarter. Sure, 6.4 percent may not seem like a big gain, but it’s kind of like winning a football game by 1 point and losing a game by anything. A win is a win, and right now, Samsung is winning, and Apple is…Well…Remember how the 49ers ended last season at 5-11, while the Seahawks made the playoffs, again? And, yes Apple recently sold its one billionth iPhone. That’s all fine and good and is a nice, big number. Here’s another number: 22.3 percent. That’s Samsung’s smartphone market share. And it’s up from 21.8 percent last year. Apple, meanwhile, saw its market share fall to 12.9 percent from 14.6 percent a year ago. Numbers don’t lie. Samsung is winning and Apple is losing ground in the smartphone market. Samsung’s Galaxy 7 has been a hit, and its new smartphone, Note 7, which came out this month, has gotten a raft of strong reviews. The iPhone 7, or whatever it’s called, has a lot riding on it. The fact that it’s coming out in time for the Christmas and end-of-the-year holiday shopping season won’t be lost on Apple, and its performance could either bring an end to Apple’s iPhone slide, or get it back in the winning column. In any case, the game between Samsung and Apple is on like never before. Middle Innings: Intel With An ARM Inside: Intel has made no secret of its desire to become a bigger player in the market for smartphone chips. Earlier this summer, reports came out saying Intel had even received its first chip order for Apple iPhones. And we may find out if those reports are true when Apple holds that iPhone event in early September that it hasn’t announced yet. In the meantime, Intel may be learning to play better with others. Intel says one of its factories will soon start producing chips for smartphones that are based on designs from chipmaker ARM Holdings. Smartphone and consumer electronics giant LG will be the first client to use the joint Intel-ARM chips. Bottom Of The Lineup:  Here’s a look at how some leading Silicon Valley stocks did Thursday… Movin’ On Up: Gains came from NetApp, Jive Software, Advanced Micro Devices, Synopsys and Nimble Storage. In The Red: Decliners included Accuray, Twitter, Agilent Technologies, FormFactor and GoPro. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.2 percent to 5,240. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up by 0.1 percent to 18,597. And the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.2 percent to end the day at 2,187. Quote Of The Day: “MARCIA! MARCIA! MARCIA!” — Actress Eve Plumb, as Jan Brady on “The Brady Bunch.” On Thursday, it became known that Plumb sold an 850-square-foot house in Malibu for $3.9 million. Plumb bought the house for $55, 300 in 1969 when she was 11 years old. Sign up for the 60-Second Business Break newsletter at www.siliconvalley.com.

Apple's biggest move was to open up the talking iPhone assistant to third-party developers for inclusion in their apps, paving the way for users to hail a ride from Uber or send a message with Tencent's WeChat using voice commands. Experts in artificial intelligence applauded the move as an important step forward, in part because the more people use an artificial intelligence system, the better it becomes. But some wondered why Apple had not made Siri an open platform much sooner, noting that competing products including Amazon.com's Alexa, Microsoft's Cortana and the Google app are already open to developers. “Is it too little too late?” asked Oren Etzioni, who is CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence and a professor at the University of Washington. “Siri is five years old and still trying to learn how to play well with others.” Artificial intelligence involves giving computers the ability to perform functions normally done by people such as speech recognition. Voice-powered digital assistants could eventually perform many tasks that currently require a smartphone app or a keyboard and a mouse, and thus they are considered a key strategic battleground for all the major tech companies. The winner of the assistant wars might able to take a cut of purchases made on its platform and also steer users toward its products and those of its allies. “This is a new platform war with huge stakes,”said Gary Morgenthaler, a venture capitalist who invested in Siri when it was a startup. “It ultimately challenges search and the market capitalization of Google.” Apple may have squandered some of its momentum. The tech giant essentially created the category by purchasing Siri, the startup behind the eponymous digital assistant, which quickly became a cultural touchstone after its release on the iPhone. As a startup, Siri worked with a variety of popular apps, but Apple cut off third-party access to the service shortly after the acquisition. Apple's move on Monday brings the assistant closer to the original vision for it, said Morgenthaler. “It's pretty sad for those of us who were part of the original team,” he said. “The rate of innovation has been less than what we would have imagined.” Technology experts have other concerns about Apple's aptitude for artificial intelligence: The company was slow to recruit talent relative to peers such as Google and Amazon, and its strict privacy stance limits data collection, which is critical for making assistants smarter. Monday's announcement did little to allay those fears, Etzioni said. “We see some policy shifts, we see some small changes, but there was no explosive announcement,” he said. But Apple took other steps to weave artificial intelligence more tightly into its operating system. The Photos app will soon study users' images to help them organize shots of favorite trips and occasions. The company said it has also made progress in determining the context of a message, helping it serve up better replies for users. “Apple is in the hunt, working hard on this,” Morgenthaler said. “They are maybe a step behind Google, but I would say they are close enough that Google is not going to leave them in the dust.” – Reuters   Most Viewed IOL Tech Sponsored Links Bulk SMS Bundles Free Budget Spreadsheet Forex Transfers: Best Rates Shop Online With Loot Join us Twitter Facebook Subscribe to newsletter Subscribe via RSS Property Business Directory <a href='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a0fa4c9b&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=9&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a0fa4c9b&amp;ct0=INSERT_CLICKURL_HERE' border='0' alt='' /></a> <a href='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a59f832e&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=4&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a59f832e&amp;ct0=INSERT_CLICKURL_HERE' border='0' alt='' /></a> <a href='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a9c7fc8d&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=5&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a9c7fc8d&amp;ct0=INSERT_CLICKURL_HERE' border='0' alt='' /></a> <a href='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a2b61fcc&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=6&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a2b61fcc&amp;ct0=INSERT_CLICKURL_HERE' border='0' alt='' /></a> <a href='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a857db3a&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=7&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a857db3a&amp;ct0=INSERT_CLICKURL_HERE' border='0' alt='' /></a> <a href='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a206f84d&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='http://adsfeed3.brabys.co.za/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=8&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a206f84d&amp;ct0=INSERT_CLICKURL_HERE' border='0' alt='' /></a> You are here: IOL / SciTech / Technology / Software / Apple enhances Siri but still trails in AI We like to make your life easier RSS feeds Subscribe to one of our feeds and receive instant news.

The Apple Watch 2 (or Apple Watch Series 2 to give it its official title) is the second version of the most successful smartwatch around. The Watch was Apple’s first draft at a wearable, and plenty bought into the promise of a phone on your wrist. At TrustedReviews we liked the look of it, but struggled to understand its purpose: It had health and fitness elements, but they were limited, and it didn't offer water-resistance. In addition, the watchOS software was tricky to use, glitchy, and just didn’t do much. Interesting third-party apps were lacking too. BLACK FRIDAY DEAL: Save £30 on Sony Smartwatch 3 now £70 Related: Black Friday Deals Related: Amazon Black Friday Deals There are clear parallels to be drawn between the Apple Watch and the very first iPhone that was released almost a decade ago, which evolved into a superb product. While the iPhone 7 didn’t meet our high expectations of it, the Apple Watch 2 has. All our concerns about the original have been addressed: watchOS 3 is now intuitive and useful; there are plenty of compatible apps; and the Apple Watch 2 is now properly water-resistant. Owning an Apple Watch finally makes sense – especially if you’re the outdoorsy, fitness type. Related: Best Smartwatch Apple Watch 2 – Design The Apple Watch Series 2 looks almost identical to the original, and I don’t mind that at all. This remains my favourite smartwatch when it comes to looks, particularly since it isn't as chunky as rival watches. It helps that I prefer square watches; those who prefer round ones might not be as kind. The Watch 2 is a fraction thicker than the previous Watch, but not enough that you’d notice without seeing the two next to each other. The square screen with rounded glass edges make it simple to swipe up, down, left and right from the edge to provide additional shortcuts, and the rotating Digital Crown still works well as a method of zooming in and out, and general navigation. The button just beneath the Digital Crown has been re-appropriated from a useless shortcut to contacts and on/off switch to a much more engaging way to scroll through the new apps dock (more details to follow). You can opt for either the stainless steel or, slightly cheaper, aluminium chassis, and one of two sizes: 38mm and 42mm. The Series 2 is available in a range of colours: Gold, Rose Gold, Space Grey and Silver. This time there’s no expensive gold-plated model. Instead, Apple has created a beautiful white ceramic smartwatch. The ceramic cast is treated at length at high temperature before it's polished smooth. Not only does it look super-attractive, it’s four times tougher than the stainless steel model. Standing out from the crowd does come at a price, though. The ceramic Apple Watch Edition costs more than three times as much as the standard versions – the 38mm one setting you back a cool £1,249. Suffice to say, it isn't necessary to spend such an amount for an Apple Watch that’s "tough". I’ve dropped my aluminium Apple Watch on several occasions and regularly whack it against door frames; it doesn’t have a single scratch on the screen or body. The headline feature for the Apple Watch 2 is water-resistance. Not only will it survive a brief dunk in the bath, it's now fit for the sea. Apple claims it can withstand up to 50m of water – although we wouldn't advise that you go scuba-diving with it just yet. It’s meant to survive the rigours of arms swinging through water, as opposed to being plunged into the depths. An Apple representative explained to TrustedReviews that the Apple Watch 2 is fit for swimming in a pool for as long as you want, but can also deal with seawater. It was tested on hundreds of swimmers before release, and it provides accurate exercise readings as well as surviving the wet stuff without any bother. The screen locks when under water and so won't be usable, but it will continue to track activity. Once out of the water, the Apple Watch Series 2 performs a little party piece to rid the water from its speaker grilles: it plays sound at various volumes and frequencies to expel liquid like a clam. There's a plethora of straps available for the Series 2 – with an even bigger selection on offer than before – and they're the best way of making an Apple Watch "yours". As well as the relationship with luxury brand Hermès, Apple has also joined forces with Nike to launch the Apple Watch Nike+. This comes with a special strap, whose compression-moulded perforations make it more breathable – ideal for athletes – along with some exclusive Nike watch faces and apps pre-installed. For those who intend to swim regularly with the Apple Watch 2 I'd recommend a Sports strap, rather than the metal or nylon straps. The Sports strap doesn’t retain any water, so you won't be left with a damp wrist all day after a brief plunge.

When I was going through the internet I came across a POST by Anderson Temi about how Grameen Koota Financial Company help him to get a loan so I applied for the loan from Grameen Financial Company throughher mail (grameenfinance1980@gmail.com)of $770,000.00 with a duration of 5 years. When I was applying for the loan I made a vow to GOD that if I get the loan I will let the world know what he did for me, to my greatest surprise my loan was granted with an interest of 3%. I was able to settle my debt and start up a new life and business with a settled family. So if you want any type of loan in any part of the world for as low as 3% please contact Grameen Koota Company on (grameenfinance1980@gmail.com) Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Free Newsletter Get TrustedReviews' award-winning reviews, opinions and advice delivered to your inbox for free!

According to a new Bloomberg report, Apple won’t be adding LTE connectivity to its second generation smartwatch, which is expected to be unveiled within the next few weeks. Sources for the publication are indicating that Apple was hard at work on an LTE version of the Apple Watch that would make/receive phone calls on its own and provide internet connectivity activity for apps on the go. However, the company was not able to incorporate the functionality without putting a serious drain on the already limited internal battery. Apple says that the current Apple Watch provides “all day battery” life, while some are able to extend that time to two days if they aren’t constantly fiddling with the device. However, extended use of the fitness aspects of the Apple Watch — like its built-in heart rate monitor — can put a significant strain on the battery. Tossing in an LTE radio to the mix would only make matters worse. Despite the fact that we are unlikely to see cellular connectivity this time around, the second generation Apple Watch is expected to include GPS to allow more precise tracking of your location when jogging or biking. And overall battery life is expected to receive a minor boost this time around. The next Apple Watch will also likely have a faster and more efficient SoC, which when combined with the performance advancements witnessed with watchOS 3 should result in a much better overall user experience.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Reduce the Amount of Data Your Apple TV Consumes The Apple TV is a capable little set-top streaming device with a lot of variety, but it’s not exactly frugal when it comes to your Internet connection. RELATED ARTICLE Is It Finally a Good Time to Buy an Apple TV? If you have a slower connection, or you have a data cap, there are some ways you can reduce how much data your Apple TV uses on a regular basis. Of course, none of these steps replace being cognizant of how much you’re streaming, but many of them will keep you from accidentally going over your limit. Turn Off Data-Hungry Screensavers The first things you need to do is open the Settings on your Apple TV from the home screen. We’ll start at the top and work our way to the bottom. First click open the General settings. First, we’ll adjust how much data our screensavers use. Click open the Screensaver settings. Screensavers can be selected from the Screensaver Type menu. If you really want to use one, we recommend choosing something from the Apple Photos selections, which uses Apple’s stock screensaver photos. Anything else may require downloading content and though it may only do this once, the idea here is to use as little data as possible. For example, back on the main Screensaver screen, you can see there’s an option to Download New Videos, which are what you see when you choose the “Aerial” screensaver. Clicking on that, the resulting screen tells us that new videos weigh in at around 600MB, so it’s best to disable them or choose a download interval like a month. Your Apple TV may also use data if you have My Photos selected, though this will only download low resolution photos from your iCloud account. Nevertheless, it’s something to bear in mind if you want to set a screensaver on your Apple TV. Change Your Streaming Resolution Resolution is very important when determining how much bandwidth you consume. However, you don’t want to change the resolution of your Apple TV from the Audio and Video settings–this will not affect how much bandwidth stuff like Netflix, iTunes, and similar sources use. It only affects what your Apple TV displays. You’re better off leaving your Apple TV’s resolution on “Auto” so it displays at your TV or monitor’s native resolution. Instead, if you are concerned about how much bandwidth services like Netflix use, you will want to change it from each of those specific services. For example, open your Netflix account settings and change its data usage in Playback Settings. Other services may have similar settings. To adjust the resolution of your iTunes movies and shows, head to the Apps section of the Apple TV’s settings. From that same Apps screen, click “iTunes Movies and TV Shows” and you can select the video resolution and preview resolution. This will make a difference in bandwidth and data requirements. As the screen says, videos are rented, purchased, and played back in the resolution you pick. 1080p and 720p require faster Internet connection, while standard definition won’t. Turn Off Automatic App Updates and Podcast Syncing From that same Apps screen, you can turn off “Automatically Update Apps” if you don’t want your Apple TV apps to update behind your back. Keep in mind, you may miss out on the latest, greatest versions of your apps, which might have new features and enhancements. While you’re there, you may also want to turn off podcast syncing. Podcasts don’t necessarily consume a lot of data, but if you subscribe to many of them, it can really add up. Turn Off Automatic Updates (As Long As You Still Update Regularly) Finally, let’s go back to the main Settings menu and click open “System”. On the next screen, choose “Software Updates”. On the next screen, disable automatic updates. You will now need to update your Apple TV manually using the “Update Software” button. With this last option, you will need to make sure that you still occasionally check for system updates. This is one of those things that you definitely want to stay on top of to take advantage of not only new features, but security updates as well. If you think you’ll forget, it’s best to leave this on. Turning it off merely gives you more control over when you use that data. Overall, how much data your Apple TV consumes is going to almost entirely depend on what you use it for. Obviously, you can save data if you stream movies and TV shows using the iTunes store at a lower resolution, but as we pointed out, if you use Netflix and other services, you will likely have to dig into their account settings.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Splashing good time: Residents celebrate finals days of summer at the Aquatic Center Summer Send-Off event. Saturday Aug 6, 2016 at 6:10 PM Aug 6, 2016 at 8:34 PM Monica Solano Staff Writer @DP_MonicaInes APPLE VALLEY — As summer comes to an end for many, children of all ages and their families chose to cool off one final time before hitting the books at the Aquatic Center Summer Send-Off event. Small squeals of excitement filled the Apple Valley Aquatic Center on Saturday as close to 300 High Desert residents enjoyed an afternoon in the sun and plenty of water-themed activities. “Basically the Summer-Send Off is our way of saying goodbye to the the summer and enjoying the last bit of it we can here at the pool,” said Senior Lifeguard Chelsea Bennis. “Once the summer ends, the pool will go back to our normal schedule with the pool set to be open mostly on weekends starting Aug. 27.” Christy James, 58, of Apple Valley, said it was a prefect and sunny day to bring her family and grandchildren, who are visiting from out of town, to the local pool for some aquatic fun. “I love coming to the pool all the time and I thought it would be fun to bring my grandkids here for the first time, seeing as they really enjoy swimming,” James said. Carson James, 10, of Orange County, said although he is not excited to go back to school, he has enjoyed spending time with loved ones and friends while venturing out to participate in various activities this summer. “I really don’t wanna go back to school, but my favorite thing I did during this summer was play with my baseball team,” Carson James said.

LATEST VIDEOS More Videos: Rates from Bankrate.com Mortgage Credit Cards Auto Chinese Apple Watch Users Can Hail A Ride From Didi Chuxing Written by: Jonathan Braude 08/12/16 - 12:55 PM EDT Tickers in this article: AAPL BIDU Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride sharing giant that last week drove off with Uber's Chinese cab operations, said on Friday that users across China can now hail rides through their Apple Watches while expensing their fares using automated account management provider Concur Technologies. Didi Enterprise, the Beijing company's travel service, said it had put together a new partnership with Concur, of Bellevue, Wash., allowing Concur clients to connect their accounts with Didi Chuxing, select their trip type and begin booking rides. Once travelers arrive at their destination, an e-receipt will be automatically sent to their linked Concur accounts, where they can directly manage their ride expenses and submit for reimbursements. More Headlines NuTonomy Beats Uber to Self-Driving Taxis Trial But if travelers already have an Apple Watch, they can hail rides and get live traffic updates during peak hours to help make their commuting easier. The agreement reached with Apple means they can download or upgrade the latest version of the Didi Chuxing app on the Apple Watch. Users can simply press the "go home" button or the "go to work" button to request a ride on the Apple Watch, once the corresponding addresses are set up through Didi Chuxing's iPhone version, Didi said. Apple's $1 billion investment into Didi earlier this year was thought to have been a factor in the Chinese firm's victory over its U.S. rival Uber. Even after spending $1 billion a year on Chinese expansion, it had become clear that San Francisco-based Uber would not have the firepower necessary to out gun Did chuxing on its home market. The two rid- hailing firms announced an agreement on Aug 1, under which Uber agreed to hand over its Chinese operations in exchange for 17.7% of Didi Chuxing. Baidu and other Chinese backers of Uber will receive a further 2.3%. Didi Chuxing will take an undisclosed minority stake in Uber. Didi Chuxing, which, like Uber, is privately held, did not give any financial details of its new services. Apple is held in Jim Cramer's charitable trust Action Alerts PLUS.

Here's what's new for Apple HomeKit in iOS 10 0 Operating Systems by Ry Crist June 13, 2016 11:34 AM PDT @rycrist Up Next Pokemon Go tracking finally goes live and actually works Apple HomeKit (finally) gets its own app Apple showed off the new Apple Home app to control all your smart-home devices. 2:26 Close Drag A lot of us have been waiting for smarter smart-home controls from Apple -- now, with new improvements to HomeKit in iOS 10, Apple wants to deliver. First announced two years ago during the WWDC 2014 keynote, HomeKit is a set of protocols for how smart-home products should communicate and work together within Apple's iOS software for mobile devices. This year in iOS 10, you'll find a new Home app that'll serve as a central point of organization for your connected home setup, along with support for new categories of gadgets, including cameras. You'll also be able to manage your gadgets right in the Control Center -- just swipe up and then over to access a dedicated smart-home section. 27 Apple WWDC 2016 keynote kicks off (pictures) Enlarge Image With iOS 10, you'll be able to view your smart-home camera's feed directly from your iPhone's lock screen. Photo by Tyler Lizenby/CNET That section will feature icons for all of your devices. You'll be able to turn things like smart switches and connected lights on and off just by tapping. And, thanks to 3D Touch, you'll be able to pull up additional options and info for each device, too -- the feed from your doorbell camera, for instance, with the option to unlock the door if you see someone who needs let in. As for the Home app, it's intended to centralize your smart home controls, and serving as a fully featured command center for all things HomeKit. That's a big change from previous versions of iOS, where HomeKit was all but invisible, existing only as a tiny section of your device's settings. A dedicated Home app will also help to clear the clutter of third-party HomeKit control apps. We've found a few of these apps actually work pretty well, but the variety of options left a lot of users confused or even frustrated. Apple says to expect dedicated Home controls on the Apple Watch, as well. How to install the HomeKit-enabled August Smart Lock You can install August's second-gen Smart Lock in minutes flat. Here's how. by Megan Wollerton 0:57 Close Drag You'll also be able to control your devices with your location, thanks to new geofencing support. With geofencing, you can trigger devices whenever the iPhone in your pocket enters or exits a pre-determined area. So, for instance, you could set the AC and lights to turn off whenever you leave for work. Apple also made a point of reiterating some of HomeKit's existing selling points (the ability to craft "scenes" that control multiple devices with a single Siri command, for instance), and made sure to point out the growing number of device manufacturers jumping on board, too. That number hasn't been growing as quickly as it has with other smart-home platforms, though; popular smart-home centerpieces like the Nest Learning Thermostat and the Amazon Echo smart speaker both work with more third-party connected home products than HomeKit does. Clearly, Apple still has work to do, but making HomeKit a lot more visible and understandable seems like a significant step in the right direction.

The company said Thursday that the 27-inch widescreen display with LED backlight technology will be available on Apple’s online store, Apple retail stores and authorized resellers while supplies last. The Thunderbolt Display currently retails on the Apple online store at US$999. It has a 2560 by 1440 pixels resolution. It isn’t clear whether Apple plans to follow with newer versions that use 5K resolution displays at 5120 by 2880 pixels, which is the display technology Apple uses on its high-end iMac. There was speculation earlier that a new version would be announced at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference this month. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on whether Apple planned to offer a refresh to the display. Apple said in an emailed statement that “there are a number of great third-party options available for Mac users.” Brand Post Predicts 2016 - Algorithms Take Digital Business to the Next Level More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Matt Kapko (CIO (US)) 30 July, 2016 06:01 - - - - print email Comments Three of the world's largest and most influential technology companies — Apple, Facebook and Google — this week reported their latest earnings results for the quarter ending in June 2016. Facebook closed the week with its stock at an all-time high. Following impressive growth during the previous quarter, it is now among the five most valuable companies in the world. Apple sits atop that list with a market cap of $567.8 billion, and Google is next, with a cap of $546.7 billion. Facebook is valued at $362.9 billion, placing it fifth on the list behind Microsoft ($444.4 billion) and Amazon ($368.5 billion). Here's a quick summary of the highs (and lows) of the financials from the three companies: Apple continues to decline Apple's 13-year revenue growth streak came to an end earlier this year, and the trend continued in the company's fiscal third quarter of 2016. Many of Apple's key business metrics are in decline, including revenue, which dipped almost 15 percent year over year to $42.4 billion. Sales of Apple's flagship products and geographic growth also shrunk, according to the company's financial results. Sales of iPads and services (mostly iTunes and App Store) were the only growth areas for Apple. Its services business grew by 19 percent year over year to $5.9 billion, and though iPad shipments were down by 9 percent, related tablets revenue jumped 7 percent to almost $4.9 billion. iPhone sales declined by 15 percent year over year to 40.4 million, and revenue from Apple's smartphone business dropped 23 percent year over year to $24 billion. Apple banked $7.8 billion in net income on $42.4 billion in revenue during the quarter. The company also said it sold its billionth iPhone in July. Facebook audience growth soars Facebook saw growth in every important metric during the second quarter of 2016. Its ad revenue jumped 63 percent year over year to $6.24 billion, and the company said 1.71 billion people now use the service at least once a month, a use number that's up 15 percent year over year. Facebook's daily active users rose 17 percent year over year to 1.13 billion, and 1.03 billion of those people use mobile devices to access Facebook every day, according to the company. During the earnings call, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reiterated the company's long-term vision for "a world that is video first, with video at the heart of all our apps and services." Zuckerberg said the company doesn't plan to run pre-roll ads before videos and will instead opt to run interstitial ads between video segments. Facebook provided no details or timeline for when ads might make their way to live video. The company banked $2.05 billion in net income on $6.44 billion in revenue during the second quarter of 2016. Demand for ads, cloud services help Google beat expectations Google's parent company Alphabet was the last of the three tech giants to report earnings this week, and its results were among the most impressive and unexpected. Strong demand for ads on Google's search engine and other products drove a 21 percent year-over-year increase in revenue. Clicks on Google ads increased 29 percent, and advertisers' cost-per-click dropped 7 percent from the prior year, according to the company. Google's non-advertising business, which includes enterprise cloud services, the Google Play store and hardware, grew by 33 percent year over year, to $2.17 billion. During the earnings call, Google execs attributed much of that growth to its cloud business. Google's experimental projects, "moonshots" or "other bets," resulted in an $859 million loss on $185 million in revenue. The company banked $4.88 billion in net income on $21.5 billion in revenue during the second quarter of 2016.

The app is  designed to make photos look better and even improves on Apple's Live Photos ability to capture scenes that have moving elements in them.  It's part of Microsoft's continued push to build applications for platforms beyond those that it controls directly, especially iOS and Android. The free app was built by members of Microsoft Research, and released for free on the iOS App Store. Pix is particularly well-suited to take pictures of people, and is built to make adjustments to a photo on the fly as the scene changes. That way, the exposure of an image should always be tuned to the right conditions. It recognizes faces and uses Microsoft's Hyperlapse technology to stabilize video shot with the app, too.  When users press the shutter button, the app will take a burst of photos and then pick out the best ones for final use. That burst is also used to power Pix's Live Image feature, which creates a short moving picture when there's motion in a burst.  That's an improvement on Apple's Live Photos feature, which captures video before and after every photo is taken. Microsoft touts its feature as a way to get the best parts of Apple's moving picture functionality without requiring as much storage space and stabilizing the result.  Brand Post Predicts 2016 - Algorithms Take Digital Business to the Next Level More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Here’s every single leaked photo of the iPhone 7 Chris Mills BGR NewsAugust 18, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share We're less than a month away from seeing the official unveiling of the iPhone 7, but why wait? By my count, we have approximately seventeen million leaked photos and renders of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Some are good, some are bad, most are blurry. But they're all here, in all their glory, ready for inspection. DON'T MISS: 7 awesome iOS 10 features you didn’t know existed iphone-7-hajek-cb01More The first iPhone 7 image we saw was a concept from Martin Hajek. His render looks very similar to the iPhoen 6s, so it's probably right on the money. The big differences are a Force Touch home button, and slim top bezel that reduces the size taken by the front-facing camera and speaker. It's a great render, and not technologically impossible for Apple. There's a good chance we'll see some of those features on the 2017 iPhone, from what we've been hearing.   https://youtu.be/SAgWEyvcruM Next up was another concept, this time from YouTube. It was published by ConceptsiPhone, and while it vaguely followed Apple's design language, it looks way off with hindsight. Doesn't mean it's bad though -- I love the small bezel and rounded back, reminiscent of the Moto X. Edge-to-edge glass is a nightmare, though, so I'm happy Apple doesn't seem to be pursuing that too hard. https://youtu.be/RJlQuBk5BHc A very different concept came from GdgtCompare, which took a lot of design liberties from the iPhone 4 and 5 series. It's a trip back to the flat-edged design that the iPhone SE still sports, but with upgrades like curved glass to make it truly modern. Personally, I hate the glass back on the 4-series iPhones -- or at least, how easily they crack. iphone-7-curved-wraparound-displayMore Most concepts and renderings stuck with traditional Apple designs to make a realistic guess at what the iPhone 7 will look like. But some of the designs are a lot more radical, showing the kind of radical rethinking of the iPhone that we're expecting to see for the 10th anniversary iPhone next year. Curved edges, thin design and zero bezel make this phone almost impossibly good to look at, but the practicalities make me wince. There's definitely no space for a headphone jack on this phone, that's for sure. iphone-7-concept1More December saw us get one of the most realistic iPhone concepts yet. German website Handy Abovergleich posted an image thinking about what the iPhone would look like without a headphone jack. The concept isn't very original -- it's really just an iPhone 6 with no headphone jack and thinner antenna lines -- but as a result, it's probably pretty bang-on what the iPhone 7 will look like. iphone-7-lcd-backlight-2More As soon as the clocks turned to 2016, we got our first actual leaked image. Nowhereelse sourced a photo of the iPhone 7's backlight -- not the most important internal component, but one that provided some clues at what kind of device we'll be looking at come September. It's about the same size as the iPhone 6s backlight. It wasn't a surprise that Apple was planning on sticking with the 4.7-inch screen size, but welcome nonetheless. Read More https://youtu.be/ZdJ7zga2yGg My favorite concept was made by graphic designer Arthur Reis, and it's realistic and beautiful all at once. It takes inspiration from the old square-edged iPhones, but rounds off the 90-degree corners to make it a little easier to hold. It looks like the perfect mashup of the iPhone 5 and 6, which means Apple will almost certainly never make it. iphone-7-case-leak-no-headphone-jack-4More Our next leak of a physical thing wasn't another iPhone 7 part, but instead a dive into the murky world of leaked iPhone cases. The first purported iPhone 7 case hints at a design familiar to the iPhone 6, but with no room for a headphone jack. Harbinger of things to come! iphone-7-case (1)More The first real look at the outside of the iPhone 7 came in true leaked-photo style: a blurry photo of a render on a computer monitor. Not exactly definitive, but in hindsight, this leak looks pretty accurate. The back is similar to the iPhone 6, but with no antenna lines and a more integrated camera design. All our most recent reports point to this leak -- from early March! -- being right on the money. iphone-7-pro-dual-camera-leak-1More That case leak was just the tip of an iceberg. The next day, we got a peek at the dual-camera module that will likely be in the iPhone 7 Plus. This is the earliest photo confirmation I can find of the dual-camera rumor, which is one of the most persistent (and realistic) rumors about big changes to the upcoming iPhones. iphone-7-leaked-bastille-1More By the middle of March, iPhone 7 leaks had become so passe that the iPhone 7 Plus (or Pro?!) leaks started coming out of the woodwork. The first iPhone 7 Plus leak, complete with the dual-camera system that has become so familiar, was published by Chinese site Bastille Post. This image included a Smart Connector interface along the bottom, a rumor that's been up and down in popularity for the last few months. We're still not entirely clear how a Smart Connector interface or accessories would work with the big iPhone. iphone-7-leak-antenna-designMore The back case has been one of the most heavily-leaked components of the iPhone 7, and we got another look at the antenna lines in March. Nowhereelse showed off a case with a single-antenna line. The lines have been one of the most complained-about features on the iPhone 6, and speculation is rampant as to how Apple will get rid of them while avoiding another Antennagate. iphone-7-no-home-button-design-rumorMore While all the plausible leaks were going on in March, a few more outlandish images continued to trickle out. One of the most suspect was this purported photo of an iPhone 7 without TouchID sensor or button. Those were supposedly integrated into the display, something we're not expecting to see until the 2017 iPhone. iphone-7-pro-vs-iphone-7-vs-iphone-se-martin-hajek-5More With enough leaked photos in the open that we had a good idea of what it would look like, designer Martin Hajek put together his usual set of renders of the iPhone 7. The redesigned antenna lines stand out, as does the camera sitting flush with the body, and the lack of 3.5mm jack. cd05alqw4aaeoauMore As the rumors about the iPhone 7 losing that headphone jack picked up speed, we saw our first image of what would replace the classic Apple EarPods. It made sense that they'd just look like regular EarPods with a Lightning connector on the end, so that's exactly what photo leaked to the wild. We have no idea if this is a real image or just a DIY job that someone with a spare pair of EarPods made, but it's likely a good match with the real thing. iphone-7-battery-capacity-leak-1More One of the justifications for killing the 3.5mm jack is that it would allow a slightly bigger battery, fixing one of the iPhone's longest-standing problems. So, as you'd expect, we got a look at that bigger battery in late March. It's exactly what you'd expect: looks like an iPhone battery, but with  7.04 Whr rather than 6.61 in the iPhone 6s. iphone-7-schematics-nowhereelseMore After all the blurry leaks of the back case of the iPhone 7, it's about time that we had some clarity and engineering precision. Cue the ever-reliable @Onleaks, who came up with a technical drawing of the back case, including precise measurements. iphone-7-dummy-leak-macrumors (1)More From technical drawings, we go straight to dummy units. Macrumors found this silver iPhone 7 dummy. It's mostly similar to the designs posted before, although the camera is clearly smaller and in a different place to most other leaks. iphone-7 (1)More USwitch then got its hands on supposed drawings of the iPhone 7, via an Apple sub-contractor. They look like exactly what we're expecting the iPhone 7 to look like, minus a change to the edge that could be due to a case. No headphone jack, bigger camera -- sound familiar? iphone-7-rear-case-leak-2More A more unusual leak was this version of an iPhone 7 case from OnLeaks at the end of May. It shows off a purple color that would be a big change to the lineup if launched, but more importantly, speaker grilles alongside the top of the phone. There's a good chance that this was an early prototype with more speakers for better sound, since we haven't seen much of this design since this leaked photo. 006djxhejw1f44hhivl3lj30qo0zkjudMore With all of the leaked components and drawings doing the rounds, it was only a matter of time until we got our first look at a working iPhone 7. Turns out, we didn't have to wait long. Towards the end of May, a photo was published on Chinese social media site Weibo, showing off a working iPhone 7 alongside two internal components, meaning there's a good chance that this is the real deal. It's very close to other leaked photos, and at the least, I suspect this is an early prototype of the 7 that might change a little by launch. iphone-7-blue (1)More As we started to see rumors of a dark blue iPhone 7 do the rounds, Martin Hajek came to the rescue again with this stunningly good render. People have talked a lot about the iPhoen 7 being a boring, incremental upgrade, which is partially true. But I will also say: just look at that color. iphone-7-camera-leakMore As we got into June, the iPhone 7 leak machine kicked into overdrive. The camera details were getting nailed down, as a pair of photos of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus's cameras show. The 7 is getting a bigger camera sensor, while the 7 Plus gets a dual-camera system that should be better in low-light and at focusing. https://www.instagram.com/p/BHB8EC5Bwyv/ Another common rumor is the Space Grey color making way for a new, all-black color dubbed Space Black. Instagram user appleidesigner helped us out by releasing a slew of images that imagine the black iPhone 7. black-iphone-7-martin-hajekMore Martin Hajek again took things a step further by making photorealistic mockups of a Space Black iPhone 7. iphone-7-lightning-earpodsMore Accessory leaks also continued to trickle out, with the Lightning EarPods get some more love. Again, it's difficult to know if these are the real deal or just a DIY mockup, since the two things would be so familiar. iphone-7-5More While Space Black leaks were taking center stage, TechTastic got its hands on photos of an iPhone 7 assembled from genuine Apple components. It's not a fully-functional iPhone 7, but hopefully should be an accurate model of what the outside of the phone will look like. Big camera, no headphone jack, just like we know and love. iphone-7-rose-gold-nowhereelse-1More To round things out, we also got a look at the case for a Rose Gold iPhone 7. The color seems a little more muted than the Rose Gold iPhone 6s, and may appeal to people who think the more pink Rose Gold is a little girly. iphone-7-dummy-02More NowhereElse also got photos of an assembled Rose Gold model, and the lighting in this photo shows it as being the same pinkiness we all remember. iphone-7-plus-nowhereelse-1More In July, we got some new photos that actually told us something new for a change. Images found on Weibo show an iPhone 7 without a mute button, which would constitute a major hardware change. The iPhone doesn't have many physical ports or buttons to begin with, so removing both the headphone jack and the mute button is a big change. iphone-threeMore As we get closer to launch day, a leaked photo of just one iPhone doesn't cut it. Instead, we need a full family portrait. This Weibo image claims to show off three different new iPhones, the 7, 7 Plus, and 7 Pro. Whether we'll see two or three new phones in September is one of the enduring mysteries that the rumormill hasn't quite sorted out yet. https://youtu.be/tqYQZrsKhDw By mid-July, we entered Stage 4 of the iPhone leaking process: comparison videos. Here, we have an iPhone 7 being compared side-by-side with a 6s. Notable differences include the much better camera and slightly changed antenna lines. https://youtu.be/-HBGkeMWsPI One video hasn't convinced you, I hear? Well, thankfully, YouTube has a fix for that. This second video is so quick that we're loathe to call it authentic, but the important details (headphone jack, antenna lines) do line up with previous leaks. iphone-7-colors-leak (1)More With most of the hardware details confirmed, one of the remaining questions is colors. Assuming the classic iPhone colors stay alongside the extremely popular Rose Gold, we're left wondering if Space Grey or dark blue iPhone 7 is really going to happen. The shot above would say no, since it's supposedly laying out all the different colors of the iPhone 7, and there's a distinct lack of black and blue. cnwcukuwgaak3ffMore Those color options were later seemingly confirmed by a leak of all four iPhone 7 Plus models, with the colors being white, space grey, rose gold and gold. It makes sense that both the 7 and 7 Plus would be the same color, and two photos from two different sources is an encouraging amount of consistency. a0b79155gw1f62u0auf2dj20zk0qotcl-1 (1)More https://youtu.be/WUxHSYb1LSI Two photos not enough? Well, since you asked, an anonymous Weibo user posted a photo of all four iPhone 7 Plus models, along with a video of the rose gold iPhone 7 next to the 4.7-inch iPhone from last year. https://youtu.be/iBqdHhFPUO8 As we got into August, the leaked video scene really started to take off. As ever, it's difficult to know if these are good mockups or the actual devices, especially since they're non-functional dummies. lightning-35mm-adapterMore We take a break from the regularly scheduled programming to look at this photo, which addresses the iPhone 7's most controversial "feature." If the iPhone 7 ships without a 3.5mm jack, something that seems near-certain by this point, Apple will probably be shipping this Lightning-to-headphone adapter in the box. Prepare to lose it at once, and spend $19 every day for the rest of your life replacing it. This is the future. china-unicom-iphone-7-4-color-and-dual-camera-600x600 (1)More The question about the iPhone 7's color was made even more puzzling by a leak from China Unicom, one of Apple's biggest partners in China. It posted a picture to social media that seemingly confirmed that the phone will be called the iPhone 7, and that it will come in four colors, including a blue. Either that, or Unicom is a master of trolling. iphone-7-powered-on-leaked-images-4More With all the iPhone 7 models floating around, one of the big missing pieces was a picture of a powered-on iPhone. That came a few weeks ago via Geekbar, a team specializing in iPhone repairs. The device is clearly running internal testing software, so it's a less reliable leak than, say, a video of an iPhone 7 running regular iOS. https://youtu.be/PqSIiNI3nxM After the photo, Geekbar also published a video of the device in question. It definitely seems to be an iPhone running some kind of software, although it could also be an elaborate Android mockup. https://twitter.com/the_malignant/status/762267748185571328 My favorite rumor -- the black iPhone 7 -- was given more credence when a Twitter user published more photos of a rear casing and a SIM tray. In a follow-up tweet, the user also said that the iPhone 7 won't have Corning's new Gorilla Glass 5. iphone_7_logic_backMore http://i0.wp.com/cdn.bgr.com/2016/08/apple-a10-iphone-7.png?w=625&quality=98&strip=all While we've seen leaks of pretty much every external component, it took until last week to start seeing the guts. A logic board and an A10 processor both leaked in quick succession, helping confirm some rumors. Based on those images, it looks like the home button will be here to stay, but the 3.5mm jack is indeed going. http://i1.wp.com/cdn.bgr.com/2016/08/gold-iphone-7.jpg?w=952&quality=98&strip=all One model we hadn't seen much of was the gold iPhone 7. That all changed with a leaked image that showed off the gold iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. All the familiar leaked details are there, but the high-quality photos really show off the gold casing for the first time. http://i2.wp.com/cdn.bgr.com/2016/08/iphone_7_display_panel.jpg?w=625&quality=98&strip=all Geekbar also came through with another component leak, this time of the display assembly. It's not overly different to the assembly seen on the iPhone 6s, but with a slightly different internal connector system. Most importantly, there's still room for a physical home button. https://youtu.be/rPZeQI3nzj8 Noted iPhone leaker Sonny Dickson has been quiet for most of the iPhone 7 season, but a couple days ago he finally entered the arena with a full five-minute hands-on video with mockups of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in Rose Gold. https://twitter.com/the_malignant/status/765483104756756480 https://twitter.com/the_malignant/status/765280503188578304 The rumor about a blue iPhone 7 has been consistently floating around, but most leaks had it as a dark blue. Twitter user The Malignant thew a spanner in the works by posting the photo above, which clearly shows an iPhone 7 in a lighter, more powder blue color. Everything else is as we've come to expect, so either this is the real deal, or a fantastic bit of CGI. So what should we expect? If you've scrolled down through all those photos, you probably have a very good idea of which rumors are solid by this point. The removal of the 3.5mm jack and the changed antenna lines seem like a lock, as do the bigger camera for the 7 and dual-lens camera for at least one phablet. But there's still a lot of details up in the air. Will we get a space black color, or some kind of blue? Probably most interestingly, will there be two or three new iPhones? The smart money is probably on two devices, with Apple have had plans for some kind of Pro as a step-up device at some point.   Trending right now: The Galaxy Note 7 has a big problem, and it might also affect the iPhone 7 T-Mobile kills data plans and goes all in on unlimited data 7 awesome iOS 10 features you didn’t know existed See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next A laser pointer from the stands helped the Oakland Raiders beat the Texans BGR News iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech Donald Trump’s advisors are lying to him Quartz T-Mobile has some of the best Black Friday deals we’ve seen BGR News Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network

Apple's iPhone 7 might include dual SIMs, keep standard audio jack 0 Phones by Lance Whitney June 20, 2016 11:38 AM PDT @lancewhit Up Next The biggest tech turkeys of 2016 Will the successor to the iPhone 6 come with a dual-SIM tray?Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET Apple's next iPhone reportedly could accommodate two phone numbers, according to news over the weekend. The next iPhone will sport a dual-SIM setup, according to photos leaked by Chinese smartphone repair site Rock Fix. The owner of the company confirmed on Monday that he had posted photos, which were reported earlier by Engadget, but didn't reveal where or how he got them. A dual-SIM allows a phone to handle two different numbers and profiles, useful functionality if you need to travel in different countries or want a single phone that operates separately for work and for personal. Apple has never made a phone with a dual SIM. Apple, which is expected to launch the next iPhone in September, said iPhone sales posted their first decline last quarter. They're expected to drop again this quarter. So Apple needs to outfit the new iPhone with enough innovative features to entice customers to upgrade. The next iPhone has already been the subject of reports, including a rumor that it may jettison the 3.5 mm audio jack in favor of piping audio through the Lightning port. The photos leaked by Rock Fix put the kibosh on that notion. Killing the audio jack would be a controversial move as iPhone 7 buyers would need to buy adapters or new headphones and earbuds to work with the Lightning port. Another feature shown in Rock Fix's photos is a dual-camera setup, another rumor that's made the rounds. Also, the photos show SanDisk memory chips sporting 256-gigabyte capacity. That could mean Apple is planning to offer an iPhone with 256GB of internal storage for the first time. Apple declined CNET's request for comment. Keep in mind that this latest scuttlebutt is coming from a repair vendor. It's wise to take the information with a grain of salt. And don't forget: the rumor wheel is likely to keep spinning around and around as we get closer to the anticipated September release of the new iPhones.

This year’s iPhone appears to be a pretty modest update largely because of what we expect will be an iPhone 6s-like design, but I’ve seen a generally positive response to rumors so far from the type of users that insiders sometimes call normals. What feels like a boring iPhone cycle to insiders still holds a sense of magic for others. Perspective is important. There’s also a splash of magic that seems to spread to even cynical insiders as Apple’s rumored plans turn into official products. We already know how the next few weeks will play out, but there’s still an adrenaline rush that comes with each step along the way… One factor to note is that there’s always a ‘meh’ factor for the press during an ‘S’ year for the iPhone, yet Apple still broke records with iPhone 4s and iPhone 5s launches. The last two quarters with iPhone 6s haven’t seen year-over-year growth, but there are other factors at play besides the ‘S’ factor. Expect the ‘meh’ response from the press to be amplified this year, and iPhones to continue to be sold in the tens of millions anyway. Anecdotally, among the normals I’ve seen a lot of excitement for new iPhone models ahead of their release — even when people see what we’re expecting. Dual cameras on the Plus model and a potentially darker space gray or black version are features many people care about. Case-compatibility could even be an upside for average users in a year when enthusiasts were looking for a more radical change like what we’re expecting next year. Based on the rumors alone, I’ve been very much on the fence about buying the next iPhone even though I have a yearly upgrade plan through my carrier. My wife, on the other hand, saw the recent space black leak and commented that she’d switch to that from her rose gold iPhone 6s Plus. Okay, so maybe normals aren’t as bored as the cynical press. I also think new iPhone colors are like new emoji in iOS updates: people really care about that kind of thing. The white shell on the iPhone 3GS, the long-delayed white iPhone 4, the slate iPhone 5, the iPhone 5s in gold and space gray, every iPhone 5c, and the rose gold iPhone 6s. They may not be the #1 reason to upgrade (or maybe they are!), but people care about color even if much of the shell hides inside a protective case. Then when this week’s iPhone 7 release date story hit Facebook’s trending topics page, I discovered what a lot of regular folks were saying about the upcoming iPhones. Below are a few examples: “Been waiting patiently. 💁🏻💪🏼” “Here comes the Monster Machine!” “I Will Have 😍” “Will be getting mine” “I want 1.” “This is my wish for christmas” “Anyone else as excited as I am” And that was on a story suggesting the launch date may be a week later than previously rumored. People are excited. I even saw one person planning a pre-order party. You almost wouldn’t think it’s likely going to be sort of a double ‘S’ year, and it seems like many people aren’t interpreting the rumors that way. This isn’t the kind of thing you hear about in the tech press this year, but we’re not everybody. Perspective. My next guess is that even some of us in the tech press will find one reason or another to be excited about a new iPhone that looks a lot like the last two models. The same is true for a lot of our readers that similarly yawn at yet another year of the iPhone 6 design. Think about it. A faster chip and a better camera are usually the main upgrades we care about year-over-year. Less technical customers buy new iPhones every two to three years, but we pay for the latest models before they’re even in stores so we can get them on day one. Major iPhone changes don’t happen year-over-year; it’s the collection of changes from a model here and a model there that add up to upgrade-worthy iPhones. We buy new models every year anyway. We care about the smallest camera improvements and how the A9 beats the A8 and that RAM upgrades keep more tabs saved in memory for Safari. That’s the thing that I’m thinking about now: the new iPhone is expected to drop the headphone jack, but no one believes the new models will be the same speed or slower, and the camera improvement could be dramatic with a second sensor. Finally, consider how the next few weeks will go. John Paczkowski at Buzzfeed or someone will report a date that is considered by insiders as solid for the next iPhone event (although we may be past that point this year), then Apple will follow with press invites making it official (probably next week on Thursday, August 25). Then the event will likely happen on September 7, just 20 days from now, followed by pre-orders likely on September 9 and deliveries on September 16 or September 23. A lot of on-the-fence types will cave in and ultimately buy the new iPhone (I’m still on the fence but leaning mostly on the side that doesn’t buy) because each one of those events adds a little shot of excitement into the experience. Then there’s the fear of missing out factor, the appeal of any new iPhone on the day that deliveries go out, and any features we don’t know about yet that will make the new models more appealing regardless of how they look. Blame it on the Reality Distortion Field (a Steve Jobs invention) or simply Apple’s magic, but more people are as excited as ever about Apple’s next iPhones despite what the tech press would have you believe.

Known as Shenzhen Baili Marketing Services, the company filed a lawsuit against Apple in 2014, claiming that the iPhone 6 and 6S looked too much like its 100C phone. Baili wanted a ban placed on iPhone 6 sales in Beijing, something the capital city's intellectual property regulator was prepared to do. But Apple filed an appeal, which means the iPhone 6 lineup remains on sale in Beijing. Phone calls to Baili, which is owned by Chinese smartphone manufacturer Digione, were unanswered, according to the Wall Street Journal. Baili's websites no longer exist. And visits by the Journal to the three registered locations turned up no company offices. CNET attempted to track down Baili but couldn't find a website for the company. Further, Baili and Digione are both broke as their debt is greater than their overall assets. Digione's collapse was the result of "buggy products, mismanagement and fierce competition," former employees and investors told the Journal. The lack of any obvious presence is just the latest wrinkle in the bizarre case that has wrapped up Apple in yet another patent infringement case. The lawsuit highlights the tough environment Apple faces in China, which also ruled earlier this year that Apple doesn't own the rights to the iPhone trademark. Despite its lack of presence, Baili is "still operational in its necessary functions," and will continue to fight Apple in court, Digione lawyer Andy Yang told the Journal. Baili may even think about escalating its lawsuit to include the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus, Yang added. But with its appeal in place, Apple needn't worry about a ban on iPhone sales in Beijing, at least not for now. Apple did not immediately respond to CNET's request for comment.

The beloved Apple store Tekserve on West 23rd Street has just closed its doors, and its legendary Mac Museum needs a new home. The vintage Mac collection is impressive, and it's now on the auction block—from the listing: Collection of 35 selected Macintosh computer models including: Outbound, Macintosh 128k (TED 25th Anniversary Edition), Macintosh 128k (Signed by Steve Wozniak), NeXTcube, Apple IIc, Apple IIe, Apple III, Macintosh 128k, Macintosh SE, Macintosh Classic, Macintosh Portable, Macintosh LC II, Macintosh PowerBook 100, Macintosh PowerBook Duo 230, Macintosh Quadra 700, Macintosh Color Classic The collection was valued around $14,000, but at press time the bid is already double that. The auction ends August 23rd, and also includes other items from the store, like typewriters and a 5-cent Coca-Cola machine. The shop has been in business since 1987 and, as Cult of Mac notes was founded by Dick Demenus and David Lerner—it "became the go-to repair store for early Mac fans because of its fast, affordable service. It grew to be the largest independent Apple reseller and service provider in the U.S." Maybe you remember it from Sex and the City?

Try it at your local Apple Store, and you'll get $5 or £5 in credit.Photo by Apple Sign up for Apple Pay at an Apple Store, and you'll get a $5 or £5 gift card for your effort. The promotion, which started this week, works as follows, according to blog site MacRumors: Buy something at an Apple Store, and an employee will ask if you wish to use Apple Pay. If you haven't yet tried the mobile payment service, the employee will volunteer to take you through the process. If you agree to use Apple Pay to buy the item in hand, your reward will be a $5 or £5 iTunes gift card. The value on the gift card can be applied toward any item in the store, whether it's hardware, software or an accessory. You can even keep the $5 or £5 credit if you decide to return the item. The offer is available in the US and the UK. The only catch is that it's valid only if you've never used Apple Pay before. Apple Pay has been expanding to more banks and retailers in the handful of countries and territories where it's available: the US, the UK, Canada, Switzerland, Australia, China, Singapore and, as of this week, France and Hong Kong. It's one of many new payment services clamoring for a favored spot on the millions of phones in consumers' hands, including Walmart Pay, Samsung Pay and Google's Android Pay. A security feature of Apple Pay is that your credit or debit card numbers are not shared by Apple with retailers or sent with your payment.

The bounty program will begin as invite-only on Sept. 1, including only a few dozen researchers. Apple said the program will become more open as it grows, and if a non-member approaches Apple with a significant bug, they’ll be invited into the program to work it through. The program offers payments of $50,000 to $200,000 depending on the severity of the bug discovered. In addition, for now, the new program is also limited to five distinct categories of bugs. The most valuable category — worth up to $200,000 — is vulnerabilities that compromise the secure boot firmware components, cutting at the heart of Apple's hardware protections.  Smaller rewards are available for the extraction of data from the Secure Enclave, extraction of arbitrary code, escaping a sandboxed process, and obtaining unauthorized access to iCloud account data.

Cosmos Rings for Apple Watch puts a slick role-playing quest on your wrist The Final Fantasy maker's exclusive new game plays to the Watch's strengths. Andrew Hayward (Macworld.com) on 08 August, 2016 22:00 0 - - - - print email The Apple Watch hasn’t yet become the wearable gaming sensation that some hoped for, with an irregular stream of interesting games and little spotlight from Apple itself. Games like Lifeline and Runeblade have shown that there’s potential to create compelling experiences around the Watch, but for the most part, larger publishers haven’t taken much interest. However, that might be changing. In July, Square Enix—the storied publisher behind the legendary Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest role-playing series—released Cosmos Rings, its first-ever Apple Watch exclusive. True to the publisher’s legacy, Cosmos Rings is a role-playing adventure, but it’s one that is tuned to the strengths and limitations of the Apple Watch: it’s simplistic and playable in tiny bursts… or you can just let it play itself most of the time. Glance over for a quick burst of action during the day with Cosmos Rings. It’s also nicely polished and presented, although the premium price point ($6 now; $9 once August ends) might surprise some mobile gaming fans. Cosmos Rings has been rocking my wrist since it lunched, and I’ve been pulled into its progressive grind more so than with any other Apple Watch game to date. Here’s why it’s worth a look for wrist-based gaming fans—and a positive sign for the future. Cosmos from Chaos Cosmos Rings is apparently spun off from the Chaos Rings series, which was Square Enix’s first major attempt to create original RPGs for iOS devices. Luckily, you don’t need to be familiar with the four previous games in that series, which is smart, since the first three aren’t even on the App Store anymore—only Chaos Rings III remains. So much for franchise-building! Your iPhone sets up the story, in which a fateful argument shapes the adventure. While the game is played entirely on the Apple Watch, you’ll need your iPhone for a few minutes to kick off the storyline. The God and Goddess of Time oversee the passage of time across the universe, but disagree over whether they should ever intervene to help humans in peril. When the God ultimately does stop time, the Goddess shatters into pieces that fall into the Rift, which the God of Time must then explore to bring back his beloved. From there, you’ll swap over to the wrist and guide the God of Time through battles as he tries to restore the movement of time and recover the shards. This takes place over the course of several in-game days, each with 12 “hours” worth of monsters to slay. Cosmos Rings takes its cues from roguelike games such as FTL: Faster Than Light and The Binding of Isaac, in which your character can die permanently and you’ll be forced to start over again. Sounds rough, right? The upside is that you gradually get stronger and earn new abilities, which enhance and empower each subsequent run. It’s a hardcore genre made pleasingly straightforward in Cosmos Rings. In fact, the game can play on its own most of the time without your interaction or even oversight: The God of Time will swing his sword every few seconds, clear through the monsters in each area, and then face a tough Reaper of Time boss at the end of each in-game hour. You will need the Watch screen on for those bosses and during the last three minutes of each play attempt, but otherwise there’s gradual progress being made while you’re in a meeting or taking a nap. That’s handy. The bright-on-black aesthetic looks great on the little OLED display. At the start, each campaign lasts for 30 minutes of real time—once the timer ticks down, the God of Time falls and his quest begins anew at the start. However, you’ll earn experience points all the while, which can be used to enhance your sword’s power, permanently buy more minutes for your timer, or even add special abilities that can be chained together with powerful results. Over time, these little upgrades help you push further and further with each new attempt, unlocking more of the game. And if you actually pay the game a small amount of attention, rather than just letting it exist on your wrist, then the rewards and progress are significantly amplified. Wrist warrior To be honest, I didn’t even realize there was an active component at first—Cosmos Rings’ concise instructions on the Watch aren’t always super clear, nor are they complete. You can find out plenty more via the Help section on the iPhone app, but in the moment, I figured the extent of my active tinkering was simply picking the right upgrades and abilities over time and starting new adventures as needed. Not true! In battle, you can tap the screen to bring up your skill relics, which recharge and rotate into view when available—and tapping each one adds, for instances, a massive power boost to your next attack. Keep tapping these skills in succession and you’ll create even more damaging chain attacks, which help you clear through monsters at a much faster clip. Choosing upgrades, reading story snippets, and turning back time are also part of the Cosmos Rings equation. Better yet, you can unlock additional skill slots to extend your chains, which ultimately makes active play even more rewarding over time. But it also becomes more necessary, it seems, otherwise the higher-level enemies will take ages to defeat if you’re just watching rather than actually interacting. It’s an interesting approach that not only eases you into the game’s mechanics, but also quickly shows you the benefits of playing your moment-to-moment role. It’s not the only active perk, either, as you can also rewind time to effectively reset the clock. Rolling back the digital crown lets you go back to the start of the current “hour” or back to any previous one, thus adding a big block of time in the process. It’s almost too beneficial, in my initial testing: You can do it multiple times in a single adventure, and as far as I can tell, there’s no drawback to using the game-extending feature. In fact, the Help guide in the iPhone app suggests you’ll find hidden relics and items via time travel! It’s like a massive reward for being mindful of the game, as opposed to just letting it play out on its own. Ringing endorsement? Still, I like the choice provided by Cosmos Rings: You’ll still make slow and steady progress simply by checking in a few times during the day, or you can spend a couple minutes really playing it and significantly enhance the rewards. It’s an ideal fit for your Watch, then, as it’s always there running in the background, and you need only the main screen and a couple of menus to get the full experience. Even little story nuggets pop up as you explore new hours and days in the game, although the ever-upward grind really is the core of the experience. Cosmos Rings’ time-centric premise and gameplay elements are certainly a thematically appropriate fit for the Apple Watch. Cosmos Rings does have a couple of the common issues of Apple Watch games, even if it runs natively on the device. It’s sluggish to respond at times, both to taps and spins of the digital crown, and can take several seconds to refresh its status when you fire it up after not paying attention for a while. And having to keep the screen on during those new Reaper battles or during the last three minutes of your run can be a bit irritating. On the other hand, Square Enix’s first Apple Watch exclusive is attractive, and it’s a new benchmark for what’s possible on the tiny screen. It uses detailed pixel art, but rather than spotlight retro-fantasy heroes (like in many Square Enix classics), the graphics showcase futuristic, neon-heavy battles that dazzle on the wrist. Add in occasional artwork stills for the story segments and it’s surely the most impressive-looking game available on Apple Watch. But it’s also $6 to $9, which will probably shock some prospective players. That’s a reasonable price to pay for a game you might enjoy over the course of several months, but if you grab it expecting a more expansive experience for the money, then you may feel shortchanged. The free Runeblade hits some similar notes, in terms of furthering a light role-playing quest through small interactions and gradual improvement over time, but I’ve found Cosmos Rings to be a more engaging effort. You’ll pay a premium cost, but this is also a premium game built for the wrist. It’s an uncommon find in the App Store of late: A noteworthy, original game designed for the Apple Watch, plus it’s from one of the biggest publishers in the industry. Cosmos Rings is oddly alluring in its wearable design, plus it’s an encouraging sign: A hint that maybe more studios are seeing the Watch as a platform worthy of development and experimentation. Hopefully Cosmos Rings finds enough of an audience to warrant that initiative.

Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

According to Bloomberg, Apple worked with carriers in the U.S. and Europe this year to add cellular connectivity to the next Apple Watch. Apple was concerned that the cellular chip would use too much battery life, though, which would delay the release of a cellular-enabled Apple Watch 2 to December at the absolute earliest. It’s said that Apple is still working on including cellular connectivity on an Apple Watch model. The company is reportedly studying low-power cellular chips for inclusion with a future Apple Watch. Including cellular connectivity with the Apple Watch would be a big addition. With it, you could walk out the door without your phone but still stay connected because you could get your calls, texts, emails, and more, all on your wrist. Going out without your phone probably isn’t something that you’d want to do all the time, but it’d be nice to be able to lighten your load for quick runs to the corner store or whatever. Samsung already offers select smartwatches with built-in cellular connectivity, so here’s to hoping that Apple can get an acceptable solution for the Apple Watch soon, too. As for what will be included with the Apple Watch 2, it’s expected that the new model will include GPS for more accurate location tracking. Apple has already detailed the improvements that it’ll build into watchOS 3, including better performance, a dock for accessing apps more quickly, and Activity Sharing for comparing your workouts with your friends.

Report: Apple cuts back ambitious TV plans to create a familiar-sounding app Apple is building a digital TV guide for Apple TV and iOS. The very similar Yahoo Video Guide came out last year. Oscar Raymundo (Macworld.com) on 05 August, 2016 07:43 0 - - - - print email For such a secretive company, Apple’s problems building a TV service have been relatively well-documented. The company has struggled partnering with TV networks to offer local programming, and the players involved can’t seem to agree on the price of the service. These roadblocks allegedly have led to Apple hitting pause on the project, until now. A new report claims that Apple is picking up its TV ambitions but scaling them way down. According to Re/code, instead of launching a TV service, Apple is working on a digital TV guide app for tvOS and iOS. This forthcoming app will let viewers search through different streaming apps like Netflix and HBO Go to find content that they can then play in-app with one tap. This is the latest indication that Apple may have stepped back from becoming a direct TV provider. Instead, the company seems to have opted for just offering the interface for customers to access the content from their different TV providers. At WWDC back in June, Apple unveiled its “Single Sign On” feature to allow Apple TV owners to only have to authenticate their TV service once and be able to access all the channel apps available with their subscriptions. This week, Apple released a revamped Apple TV Remote app for iOS. Yahoo Video Guide, released in 2015 Why this matters: Apple’s rumored project, basically to create a integrated TV guide for the iPhone and Apple TV, surely is a let-down considering Cupertino’s far-loftier goals to “revolutionize” the television industry. Not only that, but this TV guide app seems to already exist: Yahoo released a Video Guide app for iOS in December 2015. Much like what Apple is allegedly working on, the Yahoo Video Guide lets you search all your services, including Showtime, Amazon Video, and Hulu. When we tested it last year, took less than 30 seconds for us to discover that the first Hobbit film was available to stream on the TBS app, the sequel could be rented from Amazon or iTunes, and the third and final installment was streaming on HBO Go. We just had to search for “Hobbit” once, instead of conducting that same search back-and-forth on different apps. And Yahoo wasn’t even the first to create this universal TV guide for iOS. The Yahoo Video Guide is basically a free version of Can I Stream It? The biggest thing Apple’s TV guide seems to have to its advantage is a native tvOS version, too.

Anthony Grifoni STYLISTIC Q572 For work use, Microsoft Word and Excel programs pre-installed on the device are adequate for preparing short documents. Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

According to Bloomberg, the Cupertino company has agreed to fund a documentary for the label. Artists signed to the label include Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj and Drake. The documentary marks another step in Apple's effort to develop television programming. It has signed up Gwyneth Paltrow, Gary Vaynerchuk and will.i.am as judges for its Planet of the Apps reality show, which will see app developers fight it out to win venture capital investment, and in July it secured Carpool Karaoke, a spinoff of the popular segment in CBS's Late Late Show with James Corden where global popstars sing along to their hits as they drive through Los Angeles. It is also funding a six-part miniseries starring Dr Dre called Vital Signs, The Hollywood Reporter reported in February. News of the deal first broke yesterday after Birdman posted on Instagram announcing a power move with Apple Music. You can follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

They tax rates on large companies is why they produce many products overseas. The fact you charge companies two to three time what other countries charge is the reason they are their. The majority of companies can not borrow 20 trillion dollars from banks . The fant some continue to harp on in every speech, and complains that some file for bankruptcy protection they followed the laws that they wrote. The companies need cash on hand know a days, considering in the 1990"s everyone was told they deserved a house even when they could not afford it. The fact is the corporate tax is simply to high, so many companies have to find alternative ways to subside their businesses to say competitive in todays market. Lower the corporate tax rates , and the market will jump start jumps unbelievably. Taking upwards of 90% of peoples lifetime assets is absolute a joke.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive If you can’t beat ‘em, join 'em: Victor Valley Museum embraces 'Pokemon Go' phenomenon Friday Jul 29, 2016 at 3:47 PM Jul 29, 2016 at 3:47 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — The release of "Pokemon Go" has turned the gaming world upside down, with an army of Pokemon trainers heading outdoors to hunt for the little pocket monsters. The Victor Valley Museum in Apple Valley has been "Pokemon Go" central, as thousands of players have descended on the location along Apple Valley Road to play the smartphone-based game at all hours of the day and night. But instead of museum staff banning the wave of Pokemon players, they’ve rolled out the red carpet and used the increased foot traffic created by the game to advertise the museum, with its “breathtaking bird and egg collection” and “life-sized Mastodons.” Museum Funding Coordinator Laura Crites told the Daily Press that the museum is “embracing” the hundreds of people that come to the museum, which is a Pokegym site with five Pokestops. “We’re seeing a huge increase of visitors outside and inside the museum, with many families coming inside during the hotter times of the day,” Crites said. “Our high-traffic hours are between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m., and midnight to 2 a.m. when the hardcore team players come out. It's something when you see hundreds of people come to the museum almost everyday." After the Daily Press listed the Victor Valley Museum as one of the top spots to catch Pokemon in the Victor Valley, the museum posted on Facebook that “We're pleased to see all the crowds around our gardens. While you are roaming around, please stop by inside and check out our exhibits.” The San Bernardino County Museum also posted a special note on the property welcoming “Pokemon Trainers and Ingress Teams” to be respectful of the site and “help us care for the building, artifacts and natural surroundings.” The museum flyer invites "Pokemon Go" players to bring their lunch and enjoy picnic tables located on the property as they navigate virtual worlds at the museum. Teacher Audrey Longshore and her daughter Beatrice told the Daily Press there were over 100 Pokemon trainers at the museum at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, with some people handing out bottles of water and helping other players. “Every time we go, the people are so friendly and helpful,” said Audrey Longshore, whose family lives in Hesperia. “It’s like being around the friendliest gang in town.” The museum flyer also invites "Pokemon Go" players to visit the museum’s indoor gallery and explore the museum for a “reasonable” price of admission. The flyer also asks Pokemon players to consider membership to the museum as well as the other county-owned museum in Redlands.” "We’d like to get you information on future meetups and events that might be of interest to our gaming community and we would love your feedback,” said Museum Director Melissa Russo on the flyer. “We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in caring for the Victor Valley Museum.” Saying the “community flat out rocks,” Russo thanked the High Desert "Pokemon Go" Facebook group for building a donation box for the museum to solicit donations from the hundreds of people playing the game every night in the museum's parking lot. With nearly 1,500 members, the Facebook group shares tips and locations for those playing the game, as well as asking fellow players to clean up after themselves at the museum. One post read, “PLEASE PICK UP AFTER YOURSELVES!! We don't want to lose our spots because a select few were too careless. You will ruin it for everyone.” College student Korissa Clay, an administrator for the "Pokeman Go" site, said she was shocked how the online community has come together to play the game and to support the museum. “It’s great that people are getting out of the house and being social with people, and the museum is a great place to play and to meet others,” said Clay, 20, who lives in Phelan. “The museum staff has been great to work with and we’re all doing what we can to keep the place clean.” Clay said she was “so stoked” when she saw people leaving “big blue” ice chests filled with water and Gatorade for Pokemon trainers and their guests. She added that she was surprised by the "'Pokemon Go' phenomenon that just blew up overnight," with the Facebook site jumping from 10 members to close to 1,500 in a couple of days. “The 'Pokemon Go' Facebook groups have been so helpful and respectful, and we appreciate them asking their members to keep the museum clean,” Crites said. “The donation box is very much appreciated and it shows how much they really care about the museum.” The Victor Valley Museum is open 10 a.m to 4 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday. The museum is located at 11873 Apple Valley Road in Apple Valley. For more information, call 760-240-2111 or visit www.sbcounty.gov.

Developing economies offer very different business environments. The focus is on mid- and low-cost devices. This context may explain why Apple is struggling in India. Strategy Analytics found that Apple shipped only 800,000 smartphones during the second quarter of 2016. That represents a significant fallout from second quarter of 2015, when 1.2 million phones shipped. Android, which appears to be better suited for the Indian market, enjoyed a healthy quarter. Smartphone shipments with the operating system increased to 29.8 million from 23.2 million in the second quarter of 2015. Overall, the firm found that smartphone shipments were up from 25.8 million to 30.7 million, a gain of 19 percent, between the two quarters. Wireless Big City Blues It would seem that the highest profile cities in the country would have the best wireless service. But The Big Apple isn’t doing too well. Neither is The City of the Angels. RootMetrics, in its listing of top 125 U.S. metropolitan areas for wireless coverage, put New York in 59th place and Los Angeles in 99th place. It should be noted, however, that two big cities did do well: Atlanta and Chicago finished ninth place and fifth place, respectively. No other top ten city finished in the top 10. RootMetrics performed the tests on Android phones during the first half of the year. Quality was judged by the ability to place and maintain a call and a number of speed and reliability voice, data and texting factors. U.S. Broadband Accelerating The United States’ broadband speeds accelerated during the first half of the year, according to Speedtest.net. The company found that fixed broadband Internet speeds increased to more than 50 Megabits per second (Mbps) for the first time. It was not a trivial improvement: Speeds are 40 percent faster than they were during the year-ago period, according to the firm. They aren’t fast enough, however, to change the United States’ international status: Competition is a good thing, and while we’re seeing faster performance than ever before, the internet in the U.S. could certainly improve. The U.S. still lags from an international perspective, currently ranking 20th in fixed broadband and 42nd in mobile internet performance globally. All Aboard LTE Ericsson and Bombardier have tested ways to extend the use of LTE on trains. Ericsson says that 11 laboratory tests of communications-based train control (CBTC) were conducted. Examples of the tests are Wi-Fi for passengers, closed-circuit television and voice, platform and advertising services. The release says that the CBTC tests achieved uplink and downlink latencies “far below the threshold of 100 milliseconds” and packet loss of almost zero. The ability to prioritize mission-critical services is built into the platform. LTE-based remote train control is mentioned in the release, but does not appear to be an immediate goal. Planning for Robotics Continuity Central notes the tie between robotics and business continuity/disaster recovery (BC/DR). Genfour’s Robotic Workforce Research report found that 94 percent of respondents across the U.S. and UK “either embraced robots, or felt a robotic future would be inevitable.” The report also found that 49.2 percent of respondents project that between 10 percent and 30 percent of their workforce could immediately be automated. Commentary from Continuity Central counsels business continuity managers to keep abreast of robotic initiatives in their organizations and to create plans to support processes that rely on robots. The story includes a link to an infographic detailing Genfour’s findings. Carl Weinschenk covers telecom for IT Business Edge.

Photo: Apple Originally Published By: With the iPhone 7 release now just a few weeks away, we’re also inching closer towards the release of iOS 10. Packed with a number of compelling features, Apple has been steadily rolling out iterative betas to both developers and the public at large over the past few weeks. We’ve had some time to play around with and explore some of the great features iOS 10 has to offer and have compiled a short but sweet list highlighting some of the cooler new features that didn’t manage to make Apple’s keynote at WWDC this year. Don’t miss: iPhone 7: Our biggest question was just answered We’ve covered a few intriguing iOS 10 features already — such as a new Wake Alarm app designed to improve sleeping patterns and a new Mapping feature designed to help you remember where you parked — but now we’ve unearthed a few other iOS 10 nuggets that should have you excited and ready to upgrade come September. 1. Never run out of storage iCloud made the iPhone a lot better, but iOS 10 has a clever new feature that optimizes the phone’s onboard storage meaning that you’ll run out of space less often.Photo: Getty Images With the iPhone 7, rumor has it that Apple will finally get rid of the entry-level 16GB model that it has dutifully relied on for years And with good reason, 16GB just isn’t enough to cut it these days, especially in an era filled with high-res photos and 4K video. Now for those who are already close to maxing out their storage on their current devices, iOS 10 has a new storage optimization feature that should help clear up some space. With iOS 10, there’s a new setting that lets users instruct their device to automatically remove songs that haven’t been played in a while. This should prove to be a particularly useful feature given that there are undoubtedly a ton of 16GB iPhone devices still in circulation. 2. Share your current location with friends more easily With the revamped Messages app in iOS 10, it’s now easier than ever to share your current location. Specifically, the messages app is now context aware and will prompt users to share their location in response to certain questions. As you can see from the example below, if someone asks “Where are you?”, the ability to share one’s “Current Location” automatically pops up as an option. 3. You can remove stock iOS apps, finally! For years, iOS users have lamented the fact that Apple’s built-in iOS apps — Stocks, Compass, Weather etc. — could not be deleted. With iOS 10, Apple has finally decided to end years of prolonged frustration by enabling us to essentially delete nearly every app that comes pre-installed on iOS. Briefly, the following apps will be able to be deleted once iOS 10 drops. Calendar Compass Contacts FaceTime Find My Friends Home iBooks iTunes Store iCloud Drive Mail Maps Music News Notes Podcasts Reminders Stocks Tips Videos Voice Memos Watch app Weather As a quick aside, Apple notes that if you remove the Contacts app, your contacts data will still be available via the iPhone’s Phone app. 4. Easily unsubscribe from mailing lists The Mail app in iOS 10 makes it a breeze to unsubscribe from mailing lists you’d rather avoid altogether. If you happen to be reading an email that’s part of a mailing list, iOS 10 will provide a useful “unsubscribe” option easily located at the top of the page. It may seem like something minor, but it sure beats having to rummage through an email and look for a cleverly hidden “unsubscribe” option. 5. Live filters for live photos Live Photos is getting a nice little upgrade in iOS 10.Photo: Apple Originally introduced in iOS 9, Live Photos is a great feature that allows users to take living and breathing photographs. While not everyone has a use for Live Photos, users with kids or pets seem to be huge fans of the feature. With iOS 9, however, Live Photos can’t be used with the photo filters that come built into Apple’s camera app. With iOS 10, that is about to change. Now, Live Photos aficionados will be able to take advantage of Apple’s photo filters and the Live Photos feature at the same time. 6. iOS 10 supports inline video playback for the iPhone iOS 10 finally makes it possible to watch videos in mobile Safari inline without having to watch it full-screen. As iGeeksBlog points out, once a video starts playing in full-screen mode, users can simply tap the resize button located in the lower right hand corner of the screen whereupon they’ll be able to watch the video within any given webpage. 7. Read Receipts can now be toggled on a user-by-user basis iOS 10 makes it possible to toggle the Read Receipts option on/off on an individual basis. This is a welcome improvement from iOS 9 where the feature was either applied en masse to everyone or to no one at all.

Claridge's Unveils 2016 Christmas Tree Designed By Jonathan Ive and Marc Newson [Photo] Apple Announces Environmental Advancements in China LIKE   TWEET   SHARE   PIN   SHARE   POST MAIL MORE Posted August 17, 2016 at 12:58pm by iClarified · 5267 views · Translate Apple today announced a significant commitment by major supplier Lens Technology to run its Apple operations in China on entirely renewable energy; as well as, zero waste compliance from all final assembly sites helping to lower carbon footprint and reduce waste in the country. Lens Technology has committed to power all of its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by the end of 2018, as part of Apple’s industry-leading supply chain clean energy program announced last year. Lens is the first supplier to make a clean energy commitment for all of its Apple production, and will meet its goal through an unprecedented power purchase agreement with local wind projects. Apple is working with suppliers to help transform the environmental landscape in China, and is proud to announce all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The UL standard certifies all of their manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or, when necessary, converted into energy. Since the program began in January 2015, the sites have diverted more than 140,000 metric tons of waste from landfills. “We want to show the world that you can manufacture responsibly and we’re working alongside our suppliers to help them lower their environmental impact in China,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. “We congratulate Lens for their bold step, and hope by sharing the lessons we’ve learned in our transition to renewable energy, our suppliers will continue to access clean power projects, moving China closer to its green manufacturing goals.” “Our power purchase agreement is the first of its kind in southern China and we hope it will serve as an example for other companies looking to transition to cleaner, more economical sources of power,” said Lens CEO Zhou Qunfei. “We’re pleased to be the first supplier to commit to covering all of our Apple production with renewable energy, and proud to source from local Hunan wind farms to power our facilities in Changsha.” Lens’ manufacturing with Apple currently includes two facilities in Changsha, Hunan province. Wind energy will cover 100 percent of the energy consumed producing Apple products at Lens facilities by 2018, avoiding nearly 450,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, equivalent to the energy use in 380,000 Chinese homes. Through its clean energy program, Apple will partner with suppliers in China to install more than 2 gigawatts of new clean energy in the coming years, avoiding over 20 million metric tons of greenhouse gas pollution in the country between now and 2020. Foxconn committed in October to construct 400 megawatts of solar, starting in Henan province, by 2018. The manufacturer is now well on its way to constructing the first 80 megawatts of that commitment. Earlier this year, Foxconn final assembly sites at Guanlan and Taiyuan were the first in China to receive UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill validation. With the recent addition of 12 manufacturing sites, all of Apple’s final assembly production in China is now zero waste compliant. “We applaud innovative companies, like Apple, that are leading by actively reducing the environmental impact of manufacturing operations,” said UL president and CEO Keith Williams. “Achieving zero waste is an extensive effort that requires close coordination across all facets of a company’s operations, especially when the commitment is global.” Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 percent of its operations in China and the US, and more than 93 percent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Reveals Fanatical Attention to Product Details in Processes for the Milanese Watch Band and Beyond | Main | Apple's 3D Depth Camera Team Invent a new Miniaturized Hybrid Scanning Module » August 18, 2016 Apple Invents an Energy Harvesting Component to Augment Battery Power for iOS Devices   Today, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple that generally relates to providing haptic feedback from energy harvesting components, and in particular, to techniques for providing tactile feedback from an element which harvests kinetic energy in iOS devices. There's an industry wide effort in this area of technology to incorporate energy harvesting components in future devices. Our other IP blog, Patently Mobile, has reported on such efforts found in patents from Microsoft (one and two) and Samsung. While consumers are really hoping for an all-new energy source solution like fuel cells that will deliver sufficient power to mobile devices that will last for days on end, industry players are working on interim solutions such as energy harvesting.   Apple's iOS devices often include vibration elements that provide generalized tactile notifications to the user. For example, a device may associate different vibration patterns with different notification types (e.g., email, phone call).   In many cases, vibration elements must be of a certain size and mass in order to vibrate at sufficient magnitude, Due to the compact, lightweight design of many portable devices, only one vibration element is generally provided.   Portable electronic devices also include a power source. Rechargeable batteries are often used. Recently, rapid development of advanced functionality has increased power requirements at the same time market preference for compact, durable, and lightweight devices has decreased the internal volume that batteries and other components may occupy. As a result, batteries in many portable electronic devices occupy upwards of fifty percent of the interior volume of a device housing.   Consequently, power capacity has become a substantially limiting factor in the advancement of features of portable electronic devices. In many cases, a portable device must be recharged regularly for advanced functionality to be fully enjoyed. To mitigate depletion of power between recharging cycles, the battery charge may be augmented by harvesting and converting energy from various sources such as solar power, kinetic energy, or ambient electromagnetic energy. However, including energy harvesting components within existing portable electronic devices has necessitated substantial design revisions. For example, affixing a solar panel to a device encourages a user to place the device in directly sunlight, potentially resulting in undesirable thermal damage to other components within the device. In another example, some components may be decreased in size or removed entirely to accommodate the addition of an energy harvesting component, exchanging device functionality for operational longevity.   Apple's invention covers an energy harvesting component that augments battery power in a first mode and provides advanced tactile feedback in a second mode.   Apple's patent FIG. 3 noted above is a rear elevation view of a portable electronic such as an iPhone showing four possible exemplary locations of energy harvesting components which may also provide haptic feedback; FIG. 5A is a schematic cross section of energy harvesting showing an internal mass element in a rest position; FIG. 5B is a schematic cross section of energy harvesting showing an internal mass element rectilinearly shifted; FIG. 7 is a representative flow chart of a process of process of providing haptic feedback with energy harvesting components.   Apple patent application 20160241119 was filed in Q1 2016 with history going back to Q3 2013. The sole inventor listed on the patent filing is Kevin Keeler who was Apple's Reliability Engineering Manager right up to April of this year when he left to work in Reliability with Facebook's Oculus VR. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

Until now it's been expected that Apple will unveil the iPhone 7 on September 7th, begin pre-orders on September 9th, and release in stores on September 16th. That's based on information from Bloomberg and well known leaker Evan Blass. Now 9to5Mac has obtained some leaked documents from AT&T that show upcoming merchandising reset hours. Interestingly, stores are getting a merchandising reset on September 9th and September 23rd. This could suggest that advertising for pre-orders could be planned for September 9 as expected and new iPhone models could hit the floor on September 23, a week later than previously expected. Of course, this reset could be for a launch of a device from another manufacturer. We'll let you know if we hear anything else in this regard.

A number of Australia’s largest banks including The Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank, Westpac Banking Corp and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, have requested permission from The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to negotiate with the technology giant to get their own digital wallets onto iPhones. Fuelled by the fear of missing out on interchange fees as more people begin to pay by tapping their iPhone instead of their bank card, three of the big four and others hope to use their collective power to force Apple into submission. Whilst all of the major banks have applications available for iPhone users to make transactions via internet banking, Apple has a lock-down on its devices which only allows Apple Pay access to an iPhone’s NFC (near field communications) antenna. As a result, the banks are unable to facilitate contactless payments on terminals and also fear that their customers with iPhones will not receive new payment and digital wallet offerings. The ACCC said on Wednesday the banks seek authorisation "on behalf of themselves and potentially other credit and debit card issuers to engage in limited collective negotiation with providers of third-party mobile wallet services on conditions relating to competition, best practice standards, and efficiency and transparency". At this stage, it is unclear whether Apple will make the decision to negotiate with the banks. CBA developed its own solution, released in December 2013, allowing customers who use iPhones to attach a sticker on the device which acts as an antenna. However, the solution has not been widely adopted by customers. Telsyte principal analyst and managing director, Foad Fadaghi, told ARN that consumers would be the biggest losers from the impending challenge. Read more As the magic fades, can the iPhone 7 recover Apple’s mojo? “There is only one of the big four banks [ANZ] which has the ability to use Apple Pay,” he said. “There are more individual Apple users users than there are customers of any individual bank so Apple is a larger company in that respect. “From a user point of view it is a shame that it will get tied up in litigation and a protracted legal scenario, it should be something they can figure out behind closed doors. He said that the challenge was more a result of the strength of the Australian banks which has meant they are audacious enough to challenge Apple on the issue.

Sign up now Menu ARN Apple’s bug bounty program favors quality over quantity Apple’s bug bounty program favors quality over quantity The company will pay between $25,000 and $200,000 for exploits Lucian Constantin (IDG News Service) 05 August, 2016 12:22 - - - - print email Distributors Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Ingram Micro Australia Synnex Comments After years of reluctance to pay researchers for exploits, Apple has given in and is ready to hand out up to US$200,000 for critical vulnerabilities found in the latest version of iOS and the newest iPhones. Apple announced the program Thursday at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas. It starts in September, and unlike bounty programs run by other large technology companies it will be invite only. The program will start with a few dozen researchers hand-picked by Apple, though any outsider who submits a flaw that qualifies can receive a reward and be invited to join the program, said Ivan Krstić, the head of Apple Security Engineering and Architecture. "It's not meant to be an exclusive club," he said. Apple said it was willing to double the payouts for researchers who donate their reward to a charity. Rich Mogull, CEO of information security firm Securosis, noted that bug bounty programs can have downsides, and said it's not something Apple necessarily had to do. But he said it's a good start and something Apple can benefit from. Some companies "don’t really want to get into a bidding war with governments and well-funded criminal organizations, some of which are willing to potentially pay up to a million dollars for certain exploits," Mogull said in a blog post. Public bug bounty programs can also produce a lot of noise in the form of low-quality reports that don't necessarily lead to bug fixes, but that still consume engineering resources to investigate, he said. Mogull believes Apple's program focuses on quality over quantity and has a clear objective: to find exploitable bugs in key areas of iOS that are considered a high priority. It also forces researchers to prove the impact of any flaws they find with working proof-of-concept exploits. That's harder than simply submitting bugs that might be critical and leaving it to the company investigate. Apple will pay up to $200,000 for critical flaws in the secure boot firmware components, up to $100,000 for exploits that can extract confidential material from the Secure Enclave Processor -- the secure chip that performs cryptographic operations in iPhone 5s and later, $50,000 for bugs that can result in arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges, $50,000 for ways to access iCloud account data on Apple's servers without authorization, and $25,000 for vulnerabilities that provide access from inside a sandbox process to user data outside of that sandbox. This bounty structure reflects the difficulty of finding each of the five types of flaws, Krstić said. Apple hasn't always had the best relationship with the security community. While many researchers acknowledge the solid security of Apple products, it has often been criticized for the way it communicates about security issues, or for not communicating enough. Apple is also one of the last big companies to launch a security rewards program. Vulnerabilities that can completely compromise iOS command some of the highest prices on the gray market. When iOS 9 came out, one exploit broker who counts government agencies among its customers offered $1 million for a browser-based jailbreak -- an exploit that can gain root access to iOS simply by visiting a website. The FBI has also bought an iOS exploit from hackers in order to access the data on the locked iPhone of Syed Farook, one of the San Bernardino shooters. Asked by the audience at Black Hat why Apple waited so long to launch a bounty program, Krstić said the company has heard from researchers that finding critical vulnerabilities is increasingly difficult, and it wanted to reward those who take the time to do it.

Report: Apple Car launch date slips back a year to 2021 New rumors suggest Apple's forthcoming iCar will hit the road a year later than originally anticipated. Oscar Raymundo (Macworld.com) on 23 July, 2016 05:37 0 - - - - print email Apple has not confirmed if it’s even working on a car, but rumors continue to come out at full speed. This week, The Information revealed that Apple’s forthcoming car has been pushed back to launch in 2021. The original rumors claimed that Apple hoped to have its Apple Car on the road by 2020. According to The Information, Apple’s super-secret team working on the car, known internally as Project Titan, has faced some roadblocks putting a vehicle together. Project Titan’s top executive left back in January. The delay, which was also reported by 9to5Mac, was briefly mentioned in The Information’s profile of the three Sumner brothers, Apple engineers who all worked together on the Siri team before transferring to Project Titan. Why this matters: Apple hasn’t even acknowledge that the company is getting into the auto industry, so not much has been confirmed about Apple Car. We’re not even sure if it will be electric or self-driving. What we do know is that it has been a bumpy road for Project Titan. Even though Apple seemed to be making headway last year—filing permits to build a “auto work area” near Cupertino, leasing a drive-testing facility, meeting with the California DMV, hiring a bunch of experts in self-driving tech, and registering apple.auto and apple.car—the Apple Car is a big enough project that delays are inevitable. At the very beginning, Apple was aiming for a 2019 launch date. That slipped to 2020 and now it seems we’ll be waiting another year.

But Where Is Cellular Link? Joe BacaronAug 19, 2016 01:57 PM EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Facebook/Apple Watch The rumors about the Apple Watch 2 have intensified considering that it's release date is just around the corner. KGI Securities analyst Ming-chi Kuo, the resident expert on anything Apple-related, listed the new additions to the Apple Watch 2 when it's unveiled in the second half of this year. According to his research notes, as shared by Mac Rumors, the device would have a GPS, barometer, waterproofing-capability, better battery and faster processor. However, there's not much change on the design front as it will feature the same screen dimensions and overall thickness of the current smart watch. But it will switch to LED in order to improve battery life. One thing that might hurt the Apple Watch 2 is the lack of news and rumors on cellular connectivity. Koi had shared that it might not be until 2017 when fans will see some upgrades on that regard. Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today Despite all the upgrades to the second-generation smart watch, the absence of cellular connection might hurt its overall sales, The Motley Fool's Chris Neiger wrote. Without cell connection, the Apple Watch 2 will still be heavily reliant on the iPhone. That's bad news for some people who'll just wait for the next update next year. While Apple is still dominating the smart watch industry in terms of sales, with Samsung about a million behind in terms of shipped units. However, its foothold is slipping as it suffered about 55% decrease in sales. The next question, therefore, is whether the news shared by Koi about the new upgrades would be enough for people to patronize the Apple Watch 2?

That's what Apple is shooting for by bringing Siri to the Mac desktop and opening it to third-party developers. With more people using the smart digital assistant, Siri could become the service that it was expected to be. With Apple pushing ahead with expanding Siri, industry analysts expect the increasing A.I.-focused competition among industry giants Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple should propel smart technologies to a whole new level in a few years. "A.I. means a lot to all four of these companies," said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. "You have four of the largest, best-funded companies on the planet driving A.I. right now, so I believe they will accelerate it light years from where we are now." On Monday, during Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) keynote, the company laid out its plan to open Siri to third-party developers through its API. This will give other apps the ability to not only be activated via Siri's voice commands but also will enable Siri to work inside other apps. Apple is hoping that by opening up Siri to other developers and by allowing it to work with other apps, soaking in all that extra work and data will help the technology out of its slump. Five years after Siri was announced amid a flurry of headlines about the power of artificial intelligence and all it could do for us, Apple's digital assistant has become something of a disappointment, causing more eye rolls than affection. Meanwhile, industry rival Google is preparing to launch its A.I.-based Assistant and Home hardware, Microsoft has Cortana, and Amazon has its virtual assistant Alexa with its Echo home device. Apple was being outgunned. "Siri set a high expectation of a smart A.I.," said Rob Enderle, an analyst with the Enderle Group. "The end result was that the majority of folks just stopped using it. They need to bring it in line with expectations, which means it needs to get a lot smarter, and then they need to convince people it really has improved enough to use it again. Impressions like that can be really tough to overcome." Moorhead added that users of Apple's A.I. rivals have had their own disappointments, but Siri seems to be the technology that's most focused on. "Siri was first to market with a consumer-grade agent, so the expectations were high, particularly when you have a company like Apple launching it," he said. "When Apple started marketing it and its capabilities, consumers wanted to believe it was perfect and would work under every circumstance. It didn't." Anant Jhingran, CTO of API technology provider Apigee and former team lead for IBM's Watson, told Computerworld that the key to making any A.I.-based or machine learning technology smarter is to feed it more information. One of the basics of machine learning and A.I. systems is that the more information they're fed, the smarter they get. Jhingran said it only makes sense that the more data that's fed into Siri, the more questions it's posed, the more information it's asked to find, the better it will get at being a smart assistant. "In the world of A.I., you see a lot more. You observe a lot more. You learn a lot more," Jhingran said. "The more Siri can connect with human beings, the better it will get. And in order to do that, Apple cannot depend on people pressing the mic button… If Siri was working behind the scenes with an American Airlines app, for example, Siri gets to see my dialogue that she wouldn't have seen otherwise." That is what could happen when third-party developers get their hands on Siri. Siri could become the engine that answers questions, finds information and orders things like pizzas and plane tickets – all inside other apps. "The apps are better because they're powered by Siri, and Siri is better because it sees a lot more," Jhingran said. "That will power a lot more innovation… The beauty of all this is the more accessible it is, the more difference it makes." Google has an advantage over its competitors because it has so much data on people around the world that can be fed into its smart systems to make them smarter. However, that doesn't leave Google and its smart systems out of Jhingran's recommendation that all smart digital assistants be opened up to third-party developers. "That's the only way A.I. will make a difference to the rank and file," he explained. "We must democratize all the smarts and brains for A.I. , and that is to make the technology easily available to developers. The gap between the people who create the technology and people like you and me is developers who build applications that end users touch." This should help all digital assistants but Jeff Kagan, an independent industry analyst, said this recent move from Apple could give Siri the boost it needs. "While Google and Microsoft have been getting better, Siri seems stuck in the mud," Kagan said. "It's going to be important for companies like Apple to really own A.I. Siri is Apple's A.I. opportunity. It will be interesting to see if Apple can really make some headway now."

Twitter Apple starts test run of Safari 10 Seeds browser beta for Yosemite and El Capitan to devs; public preview should debut by mid-July Gregg Keizer (Computerworld (US)) 25 June, 2016 03:44 - - - - print email Comments Apple has begun testing Safari 10 with developers running the 2014 and 2015 editions of macOS, preparing for a fall release of the updated browser to users of Yosemite and El Capitan. Safari 10 was introduced earlier this month as part of macOS Sierra, this year's operating system upgrade. Apple typically supports its newest browser on three editions of macOS: The latest version and its two predecessors. The now-current Safari 9, for example, receives updates, including security patches, on last year's El Capitan, 2014's Yosemite and 2013's Mavericks. Safari 10 will be supported on Sierra, El Capitan and Yosemite. Meanwhile, Mavericks will remain on Safari 9. The Safari 10 preview is currently available only to registered Apple developers, who pay $99 annually for access to early builds, development tools and documentation. The general public will get its first look at Safari 10 next month after Apple opens up its broader-based public beta program for Sierra. Those who have signed on to the beta preview will also be able to download preliminary versions of Safari 10 for El Capitan and Yosemite, running the preview browser but sticking with their older, more stable operating systems. Some of Safari 10's signature features will be available only within macOS Sierra, including web-based Apple Pay -- where payment is authorized with an iPhone or Apple Watch -- but others will be supported by older versions of the operating system. Among the most notable are the new ability for developers to distribute and sell Safari add-ons in the Mac App Store, and easy portability of iOS content blockers to macOS. If Apple replicates last year's beta schedule, it will release the first public preview of macOS Sierra and Safari 10 around July 14.

Unmetered Apple Music and free streaming subscriptions? Telstra, thanks! 0 Mobile by Claire Reilly 18 August 2016 2:00 pm AEST @reillystyley Up Next Pokemon Go tracking finally goes live and actually works Enlarge Image The Telstra TV app will let customers search for TV and movie titles on streaming services, and turns a smartphone into a remote for Telstra TV.Photo by Telstra Telstra is pushing hard on mobile entertainment, announcing unmetered Apple Music streaming for all mobile customers, free 3-month Netflix, Stan and Presto subscriptions on selected plans and an all-in-one entertainment app that ties in with Telstra TV. The telco announced the new sweeteners for customers today, adding to its lineup of sports streaming content, including AFL and NRL (which will stay unmetered for the rest of the 2016 season) and netball and basketball. The deals also follow Telstra's offer of free Apple Music subscriptions, first launched in 2015. Optus might have the rights to the EPL, but Telstra is clearly trying to position itself as the go-to telco for all your entertainment needs. From Tuesday August 23, Telstra will roll out three new entertainment features, including: Data-free music streaming on Apple Music A three-month subscription to Netflix, Stan and Presto (all three) on post-paid plans valued at AU$95 and over, and BYOD plans valued at AU$70 and over The Telstra TV+ app, which lets users search for 25,000+ episodes and movies on Stan, Presto and Bigpond Movies, and use their phone as a remote for Telstra TVTelstra says the offers are a response to growing demand for content over mobile. It's a demand that has seen a spike in network traffic during morning and evening commute times, and which saw one quarter of its total mobile network traffic (24 percent) devoted to customers watching the recent Men's 100m sprint final at the Olympics. And in a sign that Telstra is keen to put the high-profile network outages of this year behind it, Telstra's executive director of media, Michele Garra, said the telco's network is up to speed. "Our focus on network quality has seen us boost data speeds for 4G customers by 20 per cent over the course of the last 12 months, making Australia's fastest mobile network even better for streaming live sports and entertainment."

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Samsung wants to Beat Apple to Market with a Smart Bracelet | Main | Apple Scores Ten Apple Pencil Design Patents in China » August 13, 2016 Apple Granted Registered Trademarks for Apple Wallet and the iPhone with a Twist   This week the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office published two of Apple's latest registered trademarks covering the Apple Wallet icon and the updated 'iPhone.' Although the iPhone trademark has been around since 2007, the update is to primarily cover the iPhone in context with repairs and after sales service. The class also covers the iPhone as being a personal assistant, digital and audio player, a handheld computer, and electronic organizer and electronic notepad. While the iPhone has had a 'notes' app for some time now, noting it as a notepad could be Apple's way of covering the iPhone should it be able to work with their new Apple Pencil for note taking. Should Apple ever decide to challenge Samsung's Galaxy Note, the updated iPhone trademark will now legally cover that expansion.   Updated Registered Trademark for 'iPhone'   Apple filed their updated iPhone trademark under international classification 037 which covered the following description: "Installation, maintenance, repair, servicing, and updating of consumer electronic devices, digital audio and video players, handheld computers, personal digital assistants, electronic organizers and electronic notepads; providing technical support services regarding the usage of consumer electronic devices and accessories therefor; technical support services, namely, troubleshooting in the nature of repair of computer hardware and electronics problems; information relating to installation, maintenance, repair, servicing and updating of computers."   There was an offbeat rumor of late, covered by AppleInsider that illustrated three upcoming iPhone 7 models. Only one model, the 'Pro" model, was shown with Apple's new dual lens camera . Would that one feature really be enough to justify a separate model? Maybe, maybe not, but if that model was also designed to be able to work with the Apple Pencil, it would definitely justify a third model. Apple could easily modify a design they have on record for an iPad cover with a built-in Apple Pencil holder for the iPhone.   While admittedly it's a bit of a stretch, it's certainly food for thought for this year or in the future that's covered by Apple's latest registered trademark certificate. I have to admit, that such a development would definitely be the surprising buzz of the year and a major headache for Samsung.   Registered Trademark for Apple Wallet Icon     Apple filed their wallet icon under international class 009 which covered the following description: "computer software for organizing, storing, providing access to, redeeming, scanning, sharing, and providing information about goods, services, discounts, tickets, boarding passes, coupons, consumer loyalty programs, and gift cards concerning a wide range of consumer products, services, and cultural, sporting and entertainment events; computer software for promoting the goods, services and providing information of others over a global communications network in any format, namely, handheld digital mobile communications devices; computer software for downloading and storing vouchers and tickets for admission to sporting, cultural and entertainment events; computer software for capturing, managing, and storing credit card and debit card information; computer software to facilitate electronic payments."   About Comments: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit comments.     Posted by Jack Purcher on August 13, 2016 at 06:14 AM in 4.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Tekserve closes fabled New York store, will auction off its Macintosh collection in September Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Wednesday, August 17th, 2016, 05:38 Category: Apple, Fun, Hardware, Hardware, History, iBook, iMac, iPad, Mac Desktop, Mac mini, Mac Pro, MacBook, MacBook Air, News, PowerBook, PowerBook 12-Inch, PowerBook 15-Inch, PowerBook 17-Inch, PowerBook G3, PowerBook G4, PowerBook G4 Aluminum, PowerBook G4 Titanium, PowerBook G5, PowerMac G5 Tweet An amazing collection of Apple and Mac history is going on the auction block next month. Tekserve, once the go-to third-party repair shop for Apple products in New York City, announced last month that it would be closing shop on August 15 after being in business since 1987. Now that Tekserve has officially closed shop, Apple fans will have the opportunity to purchase some museum-worthy vintage Apple and NeXT gear through auction. An assortment of the auction items are valued at relatively low prices and there’s even a Tekserve store sign up for grabs. Some of the more interesting items up for auction include a melted Macintosh that the repair shop kept, several Think Different Apple posters from the iconic ad campaign, an iPod mini (not iPad) store display, a Nextstation Turbo machine, and multiple Macintosh computers that haven’t been melted. Tekserve’s fabled Macintosh Collection is thought to be valued between $12,000 and $14,000 with bids starting around $8,0000. The collection includes the following pieces: A first-generation Macintosh computer signed by Steve Wozniak, a NeXTCube, an Outbound Portable, 20th Anniversary Macintosh, Original iMac, 1994 iBook, G4 Cube, PowerMac G4, Powerbook G4 Aluminum, iBook, 12″ Powerbook, eMac, iMac G5 and a Powerbook G3. Other vintage pieces of technology included in the collection including cameras, radios, and typewriters. Roland Auctions NY will host the Tekserve Collection auction on August 23 at 11 am after a preview of the collection is shared on August 20 and August 22. So, a great store comes to an end, but now you can own a small piece of it.

The Apple Watch 2 (or Apple Watch Series 2 to give it its official title) is the second version of the most successful smartwatch around. The Watch was Apple’s first draft at a wearable, and plenty bought into the promise of a phone on your wrist. At TrustedReviews we liked the look of it, but struggled to understand its purpose: It had health and fitness elements, but they were limited, and it didn't offer water-resistance. In addition, the watchOS software was tricky to use, glitchy, and just didn’t do much. Interesting third-party apps were lacking too. BLACK FRIDAY DEAL: Save £30 on Sony Smartwatch 3 now £70 Related: Black Friday Deals Related: Amazon Black Friday Deals There are clear parallels to be drawn between the Apple Watch and the very first iPhone that was released almost a decade ago, which evolved into a superb product. While the iPhone 7 didn’t meet our high expectations of it, the Apple Watch 2 has. All our concerns about the original have been addressed: watchOS 3 is now intuitive and useful; there are plenty of compatible apps; and the Apple Watch 2 is now properly water-resistant. Owning an Apple Watch finally makes sense – especially if you’re the outdoorsy, fitness type. Related: Best Smartwatch Apple Watch 2 – Design The Apple Watch Series 2 looks almost identical to the original, and I don’t mind that at all. This remains my favourite smartwatch when it comes to looks, particularly since it isn't as chunky as rival watches. It helps that I prefer square watches; those who prefer round ones might not be as kind. The Watch 2 is a fraction thicker than the previous Watch, but not enough that you’d notice without seeing the two next to each other. The square screen with rounded glass edges make it simple to swipe up, down, left and right from the edge to provide additional shortcuts, and the rotating Digital Crown still works well as a method of zooming in and out, and general navigation. The button just beneath the Digital Crown has been re-appropriated from a useless shortcut to contacts and on/off switch to a much more engaging way to scroll through the new apps dock (more details to follow). You can opt for either the stainless steel or, slightly cheaper, aluminium chassis, and one of two sizes: 38mm and 42mm. The Series 2 is available in a range of colours: Gold, Rose Gold, Space Grey and Silver. This time there’s no expensive gold-plated model. Instead, Apple has created a beautiful white ceramic smartwatch. The ceramic cast is treated at length at high temperature before it's polished smooth. Not only does it look super-attractive, it’s four times tougher than the stainless steel model. Standing out from the crowd does come at a price, though. The ceramic Apple Watch Edition costs more than three times as much as the standard versions – the 38mm one setting you back a cool £1,249. Suffice to say, it isn't necessary to spend such an amount for an Apple Watch that’s "tough". I’ve dropped my aluminium Apple Watch on several occasions and regularly whack it against door frames; it doesn’t have a single scratch on the screen or body. The headline feature for the Apple Watch 2 is water-resistance. Not only will it survive a brief dunk in the bath, it's now fit for the sea. Apple claims it can withstand up to 50m of water – although we wouldn't advise that you go scuba-diving with it just yet. It’s meant to survive the rigours of arms swinging through water, as opposed to being plunged into the depths. An Apple representative explained to TrustedReviews that the Apple Watch 2 is fit for swimming in a pool for as long as you want, but can also deal with seawater. It was tested on hundreds of swimmers before release, and it provides accurate exercise readings as well as surviving the wet stuff without any bother. The screen locks when under water and so won't be usable, but it will continue to track activity. Once out of the water, the Apple Watch Series 2 performs a little party piece to rid the water from its speaker grilles: it plays sound at various volumes and frequencies to expel liquid like a clam. There's a plethora of straps available for the Series 2 – with an even bigger selection on offer than before – and they're the best way of making an Apple Watch "yours". As well as the relationship with luxury brand Hermès, Apple has also joined forces with Nike to launch the Apple Watch Nike+. This comes with a special strap, whose compression-moulded perforations make it more breathable – ideal for athletes – along with some exclusive Nike watch faces and apps pre-installed. For those who intend to swim regularly with the Apple Watch 2 I'd recommend a Sports strap, rather than the metal or nylon straps. The Sports strap doesn’t retain any water, so you won't be left with a damp wrist all day after a brief plunge.

When I was going through the internet I came across a POST by Anderson Temi about how Grameen Koota Financial Company help him to get a loan so I applied for the loan from Grameen Financial Company throughher mail (grameenfinance1980@gmail.com)of $770,000.00 with a duration of 5 years. When I was applying for the loan I made a vow to GOD that if I get the loan I will let the world know what he did for me, to my greatest surprise my loan was granted with an interest of 3%. I was able to settle my debt and start up a new life and business with a settled family.

What is Breathe for Apple Watch: Complete guide to Apple Breathe app How to use watchOS 3's new Breathe app for mindfulness, meditation and stress relief By Lucy Hattersley (Macworld U.K.) on 26 July, 2016 06:15 0 - - - - print email What's this new Breathe app for the Apple Watch? How do I use Breathe, and what does it do? Breathe is a new Apple Watch app designed to assist with mindfulness, meditation and stress reduction. It will be appearing on the Apple Watch as part of the watchOS 3 update, appearing alongside iOS 10 this autumn. With Apple Breath you set a breathing session, either one or five minutes. The app then coaches you through the session, as you practise breathing. Apple Breathe monitors your heart rate, and provides a summary of the breathing sessions. See also: iOS 10 release date, new features & public beta 10 tips for iOS 10 Smartwatch round-up: 13 Apple Watch rivals compared Apple Breathe will be installed as a default app on the Apple Watch alongside watchOS 3. The app is available to developers to test alongside watchOS 3, but it is not part of Apple's Public Beta. Non-developers will have to wait till Apple Breathe is released this autumn. You can open Apple Breathe at any time, but it will prompt you for a focused breathing session every four hours. Open Apple Breathe. Tap Start to begin a new session (or Snooze if you want to practise mindfulness later). The App then guides you through deep breaths. By default the app offers several deep breaths in one minute. One breath lasts roughly eight and a half seconds. A circular graphic on the Apple Watch expands along with taps on the wrist. You slowly inhale along with the graphic and the words "Now inhale." The screen then displays: "Be still, and bring your attention to your breath." When the graphic starts to condense, you slowly breathe out. A summary screen is displayed at the end of the session. Mindfulness and breathing are increasingly being seen as an essential part of mental wellbeing. The NHS recommends mindfulness for stress, anxiety and depression. The act of regular meditation has been proved to have several long-term benefits. Long-term meditation has been associated with increased grey matter density in the brain stem. So it's good for your mental ability. Meditation experience is associated with increased cortical thickness, which, in turn, makes you more capable of resisting pain. So it's good for physical as well as mental pain. Mindfulness can help people with ADHD, anxiety, depression and other psychological symptoms. Meditation alters the structure of the brain network, which helps manage psychological symptoms. Professor Mark Williams, former director of the Oxford Mindfulness Centre, says: "It's easy to stop noticing the world around us. It's also easy to lose touch with the way our bodies are feeling and to end up living 'in our heads' - caught up in our thoughts without stopping to notice how those thoughts are driving our emotions and behaviour. "[An] important part of mindfulness is an awareness of our thoughts and feelings as they happen moment to moment. It's about allowing ourselves to see the present moment clearly. When we do that, it can positively change the way we see ourselves and our lives."

Anthony Grifoni STYLISTIC Q572 For work use, Microsoft Word and Excel programs pre-installed on the device are adequate for preparing short documents. Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady The real reason Apple dumbed-down the iPhone 7 camera Posted by: Jason O'Grady Date: Thursday, August 18th, 2016, 08:00 Category: Hardware, iPhone, Opinion Tweet I agree 100 percent with Chris Smith’s post on BGR about how the iPhone 7 is about to become inferior to the larger iPhone 7 Plus in a very significant way. The iPhone 7 Plus’ dual-camera vs the single camera in the 7. (Photo: BGR.com) I greatly prefer the 4.7-inch form factor iPhone and won’t buy the larger “Plus size” iPhone because it’s too bulky and it can’t be used with one hand. Plus, my iPad Pro and MacBook usually aren’t far away for when I need a larger screen. In his article Smith lists several possible excuses Apple might trot out for omitting the dual-lens camera from the iPhone 7, but the real reason is after the jump. Here’s Smith’s excuse list: It’s too bulky If Apple removes the headphone jack, shouldn’t this have created some additional room inside the device? It will impact battery life Apple could add a setting to turn off one of the cameras to save battery (which almost no one would use). Supply concerns Bullocks. Apple could use its significant influence to get the camera parts from suppliers, and if not, I have concerns about Cook’s reputation as “operational genius” and “master of the supply chain.” It’s more expensive Most likely true, but how much more expensive? The rear camera module in the iPhone 6s is estimate to cost $22.50. Does the dual-camera module cost 10, 50, 100 percent more? Apple could either, a) eat the increase, or b) increase the cost. Altough I think that Apple should eat the extra cost, I’d definitely pay as much as $50 more for the better camera). This is where Smith nails it: …Apple likes its high iPhone prices and its high iPhone margins. Apple isn’t willing to absorb the additional cost of the better, dual-camera module in order to keep the base $549 price of the 4.7-inch iPhone. And by extension it is willing to punish its iPhone 7 customers with an inferior camera to protect its margins. iPhone sales dropped 16 percent last quarter and the 4.7-inch iPhone outsells the 5.5-inch iPhone (by as much as by seven to one). What better way to jump start slumping revenue and profit? Nudge millions of (reluctant) iPhone 7 customers to buy the pricier iPhone 7 Plus for its better camera. Bummer. Update 2016-0808: If you share my concern about your next iPhone including a dumbed-down rear camera, take solace, it’ll probably include Optical Image Stabilization (OIS).

Photo by CNET The iPhone 7 is likely to debut in another month, and rumors about its features continue to pour in. Apple is planning to revamp the home button to use pressure-sensitive technology, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing "people familiar with the matter." Instead of offering a physical button that you press down to trigger an action, the new iPhone 7 will feature a non-physical button that vibrates to let you know you've touched it. This rumor was also tipped off by Japanese blog site Makotakara in late July. The latest report reaffirms the long-running rumors that Apple's next iPhone will offer only modest changes. With the iPhone sales on a downslide over the past few quarters, Apple needs something big to draw in buyers. Another much-rumored feature also served up by Bloomberg's sources is a dual-camera system for the iPhone 7 Plus. The dual cameras on the larger-screened iPhone would create brighter, more detailed photos, according to someone who snapped some shots with a prototype of the new phone. The dual sensors would each take their own photos, which then merge into a single image. This would allow your zoomed-in photos to retain better clarity and produce sharper images under low-light conditions, the source said. The new iPhones, according to Bloomberg, will also ditch the traditional 3.5mm audio jack, another rumor that's been making the rounds. In its place would be a second speaker, giving the iPhone stereo speakers for the first time. Instead of using audio cables that plug into the traditional jack, people would use wireless headphones and speakers or ones that plug into the Lightning port. Adapters would likely be available that would let you continue to use your existing audio accessories. Finally, the iPhone 7 will come in a new Space Black color, 9to5Mac reported Monday, basing its info on a series of leaked photos. If true, Space Black would mimic the same color available for the Apple Watch. As always, rumors like these should be taken with a grain of salt. We'll discover the actual features and specs of the iPhone 7 when Apple hosts its launch event in September as anticipated. Apple did not immediately respond to CNET's request for comment.

TechRadar pro IT insights for business Search RSS News Reviews Insights TechRadar Business Laptop/PC Printers Hardware Software Mobile working Security Networks Management Data centre & Cloud News iMac 2016 release date, news and rumors iMac 2016 release date, news and rumors By Ben Stinson PC   The latest all-in-one from Apple is (hopefully) about to drop Shares Although it may seem that the range has only recently seen an upgrade, the late 2015 iMac brought little more than a processor upgrade and a long-awaited bump to Retina screens across the board. With Apple's computing market share dipping to 7.2% in Q3 2016, you would expect the company to release a new round of iMacs in time for its October event. Unfortunately, for Mac desktop fans, it appears as though the press keynote will be focused on the introduction of new MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs. The biggest updates are likely to be seen with the guts of Apple's iMac range, with Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors now ready for production. The latest AMD Polaris graphics chips should also be on-board for video editing and high-resolution gaming, though recent reports have suggested Apple is working with Nvidia this time around. Other improvements are being chattered about via the rumour mill in the expectedly feverish build up to the new iMac's release, with VR compatibility currently headlining the list of less attention-grabbing features. Keep on reading to find out more about the new developments we're expecting from the 2016 iMac refresh. Also check out: MacBook Pro 2016 release date, news and rumours Cut to the chase What is it? The latest generation of Apple's all-in-one desktop computer When is it out? Rumours suggest October 2016 What will it cost? Prices are expected to start at £899 ($1,099), as they do today iMac 2016 release date Unless Apple chooses to go big on VR at the next event, the reveal of a new iMac isn't necessarily a dead-cert. In the past, desktop Mac refreshes have been a couple of years apart, so the launch of an updated iMac could end up being delayed until WWDC 2017 in June. Still, there's plenty of new hardware for Apple to pack into its popular all-in-one PC, so it's best to stay optimistic that the Cupertino giant will unveil some other tasty new tech alongside the iPhone 7 at its special September event. Comments by AMD suggest that Apple is lined-up to launch some hardware featuring the latest Polaris graphics chipset in late 2016, but that's as close as we have to a real confirmation of an update to any of Apple's computer range. With the hiatus in improvements to Apple's Mac Pro and Mac mini, it's likely that Apple will want to keep its most popular desktop range regularly refreshed to try and claw back some of that lost market share. iMac 2016 price The existing range of iMacs starts at £899 ($1,099) for the 21.5-inch 1080p model, rising to £1,199 ($1,499) for the 4K model and £1,449 ($1,799) for the 27-inch variant. There's little doubt that Apple will stick to the existing pricing tiers, especially considering IBM's comments on the long-term affordability of Mac usage, which were introduced when the company first launched the 'cheaper' iMac back in June 2014. Will it be Intel's Kaby Lake or AMD Zen for iMac 2016? With the last iMac update, Apple skipped on Intel's Broadwell processors and went straight to the latest Skylake chips for the 2015 iteration. Intel is set to provide the latest Kaby Lake processors for the next range of iMacs, the last in Intel's 14nm processing line before the switch to Cannonlake's 10nm architecture later in 2017. Though it is likely Apple will stick with Intel's processors, there is a possibility that the new AMD Zen processor could make an appearance in the high-end 27-inch models. This very powerful new CPU features 8 cores and 16 threads that would provide users with a huge amount of processing power on tap. Of course, there's still a possibility that Apple could skip the latest array of processors and wait for the Cannonlake series before upgrading its full suite of iMacs, but this would push the launch back to sometime in the second half of next year. iMac 2016: AMD on-board with the VR-enabled future Although Apple's range of desktop PCs hasn't lagged behind rivals in the processing department, the lack of graphical grunt is more of a sore sticking point for some users, especially for those wanting to get their game on without having to switch to Windows. With VR rapidly gaining in popularity both on PC and console, it is likely that Apple will not want its loyal customer base to feel like they're being left behind. It's very realistic, then, to expect that the new range of iMacs will include AMD's Polaris graphics, which was unveiled at the beginning of 2016. Reports from WCCF Tech claim that AMD won the contract to produce two chipsets for Apple back in April, and will appear in "new desktops and notebooks from Apple, which the company plans to bring to market later this year". MacRumors thinks that Polaris 10 and 11 are the most likely fit for Apple's new range of Macs, which are built using 16nm or 14nm production processes – smaller and more power-efficient than AMD's 28nm chipsets found in existing 27-inch iMacs. The switch from Intel Iris Pro 6200 graphics in the 21.5-inch models is also highly probable, as AMD has made great gains in offering highly competitive GPUs at a very reasonable price. All in all, Mac users will be looking for plenty of power to support exciting new VR devices such as the Oculus Rift, which Palmer Luckey already said wasn't an option at present due to the underpowered graphical capabilities of Apple's computers. New flash storage for iMac 2016? While the rumours are that Apple is planning on an increased storage capacity in the iPhone 7, we're also hoping that the company makes a major move to further push flash storage with iMacs. The hybrid Fusion Drive is currently standard in the 27-inch range of iMacs and an £80 (around $105) optional extra for 21.5-inch models, though we're hoping that Apple finally makes it standard across the board with all iMacs. Flash storage capacity of up to 512GB is already available in Apple's MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which helps them to perform noticeably faster than similarly specified iMacs. Although Apple is unlikely to go down the route of flash-only storage for iMacs, hybrid drives would be a particularly welcome upgrade. A plethora of ports for new iMacs? The last Apple MacBook refresh saw Apple eschew all other ports in favour of USB-C, and while it would be unlikely that Cupertino would reduce the connectivity in its iMacs, it's certainly plausible that the new port could make an appearance. Intel's new Kaby Lake processors offer support for USB 3.1 alongside Thunderbolt 3 and DisplayPort 1.2, which could mean that every single port on the new iMac gets a little boost.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « In the Smartphone Volume Game alone, Samsung remains Number One Worldwide | Main | Apple Reveals Fanatical Attention to Product Details in Processes for the Milanese Watch Band and Beyond » August 18, 2016 Apple Invents Waterproofing Port System   In a USA Today report published yesterday, they noted that most consumers that they spoke to recently on Ocean Front Walk, Venice Beach California, said they would love to see a 100% waterproof iPhone – or at least as close to 100% like the new Samsung Galaxy Note 7 unveiled earlier this month. Better waterproofing is what we're likely to see when the iPhone 7 is unveiled in September if the rumors pan out – and today, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office published yet another patent application from Apple that reveals another aspect of waterproofing related to ports. Even though the patent figures are aimed at the Apple Watch, Apple notes several times in their filing that their invention covers a wide range of their products including the iPhone (smartphone) and iPod (portable music player).   Apple's Patent Background   Many types of electronic devices, such as smart phones, gaming devices, computers, watches, and the like, may include ports or openings to allow transmission of sound waves or to receive connectors. Some examples of these types of ports include microphone ports, speaker apertures, and headphone ports. During operation, some types of ports, such as microphone ports and speaker ports, require air flow between the enclosure of the electronic device in order to receive and/or transmit sound waves. The airflow pathway may also allow fluids, such as water, and/or debris to enter into the enclosure, which may damage internal components. Therefore, there is a need for a port or aperture that may prevent fluid ingress while still allowing airflow during operation.   Apple's Invention: Waterproof Ports   Apple's invention generally relates to a port for an electronic device, and, more specifically, to waterproof ports and apertures for electronic devices.     Apple's patent FIG. 1 is a front elevation view of an electronic device including the waterproof port assembly; FIG. 3 is an enlarged view of the electronic device illustrating the waterproof port assembly; and FIG. 4 is a cross-section view of the electronic device taken along line 4-4 in FIG. 3 illustrating a first example of the waterproof port assembly. The flow-blocking member #128 noted in patent FIGS. 3 and 4 above may be formed of an impermeable material such that fluids, debris, and particles may be substantially prevented from passing therethrough, even under pressure.   According to Apple's filing, future Apple devices could include a housing defining a port and a cavity, a processing element contained within the cavity of the housing, an input/output device (such as, but not limited to, a sound wave transducer) in selective communication with the port, and a flow-blocking member movably connected to the housing. The flow-blocking member selectively prevents fluid-flow, such as the flow of air, through the port. The electronic device also includes a fluid repelling member connected to the housing and positioned in a flow path between the port and the input/output device.   Another example in the filing includes the Apple Watch which could comprise an enclosure defining a cavity, a processing element at least partially enclosed within the cavity, and a flow aperture configured to be in selectively fluid communication with the cavity. The wearable electronic device also includes a button assembly operably connected to the enclosure and configured to selectively prevent fluid flow through the flow aperture and a sound wave transducer, such as a microphone or speaker, is positioned within the cavity and is in selective fluid communication with the flow aperture.   Yet another example of the disclosure includes a portable electronic device. The portable electronic device includes a housing defining a cavity, a port defined in the housing, the port being in fluid communication with the cavity, a sound wave transducer in selective communication with the port, and a waterproof port assembly operably connected to the housing. The waterproof port assembly comprises a selectable component movable connected to the housing and a flow-blocking member operably connected to the selectable component and selectively positioned between the port and the sound wave transducer. During operation, movement of the selectable component causes movement of the flow-blocking member.   In other embodiments the waterproof port may be used as an input/output connection port for the electronic device. In these embodiments, the waterproof port may be opened to allow a connector, such as, but not limited to, an audio jack, a plug, a universal serial bus connector, or the like, to be received therein. However, when the waterproof port is not in use, the flow-blocking member may cover the opening to prevent air, fluid, and debris from entering the opening.   With reference to patent FIG. 4 noted above, the waterproof port assembly #108 may also include a biasing member #144 operably connected to the actuator #134 and/or flow-blocking member #128. The biasing member may be substantially any element that can exert a biasing force against the flow-blocking member and actuator. In one embodiment, the biasing member may be a spring, which can be compressed by the actuator with a predetermined amount of force. Upon removal of the force, the biasing member may return the actuator to its original position. Other possible biasing members are, but are not limited to, a piston, a magnet, and the like.   Patent Credits   Apple patent application 20160239047 was filed in Q1 2016. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Other recent waterproofing patents made publicly recently include one for waterproof buttons and another for waterproof speakers as noted in the graphic below.     Another Apple patent application that could be batched into this category today is a filing titled "Method for Clearing Water from an Acoustic Port and Membrane." In this invention, Apple describes placing a heating element in an acoustic port that could expedite the evaporation of liquids accumulated with a port. For more on this see Apple's patent application 20160241945 here.   Apple's patent FIG. 2 noted above is an exploded cutaway view of an sample embodiment of an acoustic port having a heating element positioned behind an acoustic membrane.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

The upcoming Apple Watch 2 will not, however, feature cellular connectivity to make it less dependent on the iPhone, as Apple has not been able to compensate for the extra battery life that a cellular connection consumes. Apple had been in talks this year with mobile phone carriers in the U.S. and Europe to add cellular connectivity to the watch, according to people familiar with the talks. A cellular chip would have theoretically allowed the product to download sports score alerts, e-mail and mapping information while out of an iPhone's reach. During the discussions, Apple executives expressed concern that the cellular models may not be ready for release this year and that the feature may be pushed back to a later generation, according to the people. Apple warned that, even on an aggressive schedule, the earliest possible shipment time-frame for cellular models would have been this December, one of the people said.Apple is researching low-power cellular chips for future versions of the Apple Watch, but has been unable to make it work for 2016. The company's "ultimate goal" for the Apple Watch is to decouple it from the iPhone, but technology will need to improve before it is able to do so. LTE connectivity and significant Apple Watch design changes are not expected before 2017. The addition of a GPS chip, something planned for the next-generation Apple Watch, will allow the device to more accurately determine a user's location for better fitness and health tracking capabilities along with improved navigation. Previous reports have also suggested the Apple Watch 2 will include a barometer, a higher capacity battery, and improved waterproofing techniques. Bloomberg's report does not give a specific launch date for the next-generation Apple Watch beyond "fall," but it is possible Apple plans to launch new Apple Watch models alongside the iPhone 7, which is expected to be unveiled at an event that will take place on September 7. A previous rumor from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has suggested we will see both a second-generation Apple Watch with the aforementioned new features and an upgraded first-generation Apple Watch with an improved processor and superior waterproofing.

Skip to main content Apple Valley Review Main menu Home Arrest Logs Classifieds Community Events Contact Us Opinion Roy's 100th You are here Home Pereira named Employee of the Quarter August 3, 2016 By Staff Reports APPLE VALLEY — They say good things come in small packages. That phrase certainly applies to the Town of Apple Valley’s latest Employee of the Quarter honoree, Paula Pereira, though don’t let her small stature fool you. Among her many tasks, Pereira has wrangled the town’s largest construction project to date — the Yucca Loma Bridge and Yucca Loma Road construction and widening projects. “Paula is the single point of contact for no less than five government agencies, six utility companies and four contracting companies,” Senior Construction Inspector Brett Morgan said. “She is responsible for the tracking and invoicing of payments to and from many of these entities and ensures that the more than $40 million in public funds for both projects are properly disbursed.” In addition to her work on the Yucca Loma Road projects, Pereira is also a key player in other state and federally funded jobs within the town. As a registered land surveyor, Pereira provides in-house review of all sub-division maps proposed in Apple Valley. She has also taken the time to study the tedious requirements associated with the Safe Routes to School and Highway Safety Improvement Program grants. She coordinates with Caltrans to get projects from concept through design, and on to construction. “With Paula’s keen understanding of the regulations and her dedication to the goals of the town, these important improvements will continue to be constructed and further 'a better way of life’ in Apple Valley," Morgan said. Pereira, who has been with the town since March 1, 2011, was honored at Tuesday's Town Council meeting. Nominations for Employee of the Quarter are submitted by peers or management and honorees are selected by a committee. Search Search © Copyright 2014 Local Media Group, Inc.

Stine on 08.18.2016       Tweet print  rss  The developers of the NextRadio application feel they are out of start-up mode. They believe their efforts to monetize the “hybrid radio” app will take hold in 2017 as more wireless providers activate chips enabling FM tuners in their smartphones to receive local radio signals. The project appears to be at an important time of transition. To date, NextRadio has been an expense rather than a revenue generator for the radio industry, which has paid millions of dollars to Sprint to help kick-start its rollout. That seminal three-year agreement expires this month, and NextRadio has been in arrears with Sprint; it is working with broadcasters and others to fund its multimillion-dollar obligation. Now it hopes to build a business around ad revenue sharing; it recently secured its first national advertiser. The NextRadio app shows a Home Depot ad. “WHAT RADIO MUST DO” The app was developed by TagStation LLC, owned by Emmis Communications, with support from NAB Labs; it combines local FM radio listening with online interactivity. Proponents view it as part of industry efforts to boost terrestrial radio’s reach, to provide users with visual and two-way features, and to add digital platforms for advertisers who desire data attribution. They believe the ability to target listeners and measure results will spur the technology to break out and make money for the industry. As part of a spring home and garden radio campaign, big retailer Home Depot committed national ad dollars to NextRadio. Visual ads were displayed with action buttons linking to a Home Depot URL or a mapping feature to find a store. The package was sold in a collaborative effort involving NextRadio staff and industry leaders working with the advertiser and its media planning and buying agency Carat, according to NextRadio President Paul Brenner. Radio stations involved in the buy that served visually synchronous content in the app will receive a portion of the revenue, he said. While Home Depot is the only client so far to make such a commitment, backers view its investment as a breakthrough that could prompt other advertisers. Industry observers such as Mark Fratrik, senior vice president at BIA/Kelsey, believe NextRadio eventually will become a critical additional revenue stream for radio broadcasters. “This is what radio must do. They need to open up as many revenue streams as possible, and NextRadio will likely be one of them,” he said. NextRadio has deals with cell carriers Sprint, AT&T and T-Mobile to activate FM chips in smartphones, though only Sprint receives any payments from NextRadio. Verizon also has started to allow select FM-enabled smartphones. At present the app itself is available only on Android smartphones, with a download available on Google Play. Emmis also developed and licenses TagStation, a cloud-based software platform that allows a broadcaster to manage album art, metadata and enhanced advertising on various devices. Some 3,000 radio stations are signed up at a fee of $120 per year per station to provide the additional info through TagStation; developers are shooting to reach 4,000 in 2017. Another 7,000 stations utilize it at present to display simple stations logos at no cost. NextRadio also announced at the NAB Show this spring that it was joining with the Public Radio Satellite System on the new PRSS MetaPub Platform to integrate enhanced visual features for public radio stations via TagStation. Brenner said NPR station activations are underway. The company says the app has seen steady growth since it officially launched in 2013. Approximately 43 million cellphones have been activated and the app has been downloaded 7.6 million times. Monthly registrations have been averaging about 400,000. MOMENTUM? The National Association of Broadcasters believes NextRadio has built some good momentum in a short rollout time. “As we continue building penetration of FM chips in cellphones and the adoption of the app, revenue should follow,” said Dennis Wharton, NAB executive VP of communications. “We recognize the importance of broadcasters delivering a consistent user experience to listeners, and in the digital world that includes providing metadata or multimedia content, such as artist and album information, as well as interactive advertising opportunities.” Paul Brenner speaks at the spring NAB Show. Brenner said the app is close to becoming a smartphone fixture. “We have created a hardware solution for the smartphone business in about half the time it would normally take. We were told up front to expect about six years of effort and we have done it in three. “To have a significant portion of all carriers on board now is huge. We have been able to accelerate distribution of the product quicker than thought.” The radio broadcast industry’s promotion of the app and its financial contributions have been critical. “We’ve gotten most of the support we need from the industry. It’s really ramped up to a place where the network of stations supporting TagStation now covers about 80 percent of this country’s population. We have been able to make everyone consistent in the engagement of the listener,” Brenner said. He said NextRadio’s ability to draw a paying customer is evidence the efforts are taking hold. “We have the ability to show Home Depot data attribution of how their advertising is working. That message is resonating with other advertisers we are approaching. Our ability to measure engagement with listeners from our 7 million downloads covering every market in this country matches us against any other technology now trying to do the same thing,” Brenner said. “We can show advertisers demographic data in an exact location and what the engagement level was. Advertising money is being shifted to companies that can show that level of attribution.” Brenner said the next round of negotiations with Home Depot and other national advertisers will be for a “much larger chunk of money, meaning the broadcasters involved will start seeing some real money in 2017.” NextRadio recently launched service in Canada and Peru and plans a Mexico rollout soon. Other marketing efforts continue. NextRadio recently did a pilot interactive radio campaign with Aloft Hotels, a Starwood brand, in which listeners were able to interact with a digital companion ad on the app; viewers were able to use the companion ad to book a hotel room or look for an Aloft location. Separately, it ran an eight-week promotion for a Disney contest called “Fly Away with Demi Lovato.” The app served a digital ad to encourage listeners to register for a contest each time one of her songs played on the station that the NextRadio user was tuned to. The app has not brought in meaningful income yet, according to an Emmis Communications filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year. “Through Feb. 29, 2016, the NextRadio application had not generated a material amount of revenue,” the filing stated. NO TASTE OF APPLE JUST YET NextRadio’s expansion continues on Android devices; it will be loaded on all new Samsung S7 and S7 Edge smartphones released across all carriers beginning in August. But sometimes its progress is overshadowed by the lack of having industry biggie Apple on board with iOS phone activation, industry watchers said. The NAB remains optimistic that Apple will eventually jump in with NextRadio on its iPhones. “We need to get Apple on board. FM chips have already been activated by Apple on their nano devices, so doing so on their smartphones should not be a heavy lift,” Wharton said. Brenner said he has had discussions with Apple but that there is “no open dialogue at this moment.” The company, he said, “is probably less incentivized to do anything that threatens Apple Music and Beats 1 listenership. However, if we continue the success with Android phones, I think we’ll see opportunities develop with Apple in 2017.” Apple did not reply to a Radio World request for this article. The company has been notoriously tight-lipped about NextRadio and the question of iPhone FM chip activation. Recent speculation in the tech industry that Apple would release its forthcoming iPhone 7 without a headphone jack has gained a lot of media attention; NextRadio uses the headphone cable as an FM antenna to improve reception on smartphones. NextRadio has faced skepticism at times; consultant Mark Ramsey of Ramsey Media once called consumer enthusiasm for the app “a mirage” and wrote, “If consumers clamored for FM radios built into their gadgets wireless companies would be only too happy to provide them. And they wouldn’t have to be paid to do so, as Sprint is for NextRadio.” But University of Indianapolis communications instructor Scott Uecker told the Indianapolis Business Journal this year he remains optimistic NextRadio can continue to gain momentum citing the interactive nature of the app as “a very big draw” for people in their teens. (Emmis is based in Indianapolis.) “Those who say this is just about pushing the radio signal to the cellphone are missing the additional experience that [NextRadio] brings,” Uecker said. Peter Leitzinger, associate research analyst for SNL Kagan, a division of S&P Global Market Intelligence, sees NextRadio as an emerging technology that just hasn’t busted out yet. “The wireless carriers have always pushed back a bit because giving away free FM radio cuts into their ability to sell data. But I think people are going to eventually begin look for phones with this feature and it should be a big boost to radio,” Leitzinger said. Leitzinger, who studies broadcast radio and TV and Internet radio for the research firm, said the app is unique in that it offers older technology embedded in an expensive and powerful smartphone. “So the traditional challenges of radio will always remain. Reception can be an issue, along with static. That becomes a problem for NextRadio considering the number of streaming options now like Spotify and Pandora. I would think NextRadio’s strength will be in urban markets with lots of signals and early adopters.” “Advertisers are becoming much more digital-savvy. The data NextRadio can supposedly deliver will be critical to its success. The ability to target advertising to certain people in certain areas is what marketers love,” Leitzinger said. Gordon Borrell, a digital advertising analyst and CEO of Borrell Associates, said NextRadio’s digital platform has the ability to attribute data which is what advertisers are looking for. “It’s absolutely vital to the bigger sales because larger advertisers and their agencies require proof of audience more than ever. It’s even important, but perhaps not as vital, with smaller or direct local advertisers. They’ve been conditioned to expect data with every advertising buy,” Borrell said. The researcher said he thinks NextRadio developers have done a good job of generating excitement about the product and a fair job of getting it into the marketplace. “The app has a four-star rating [out of a possible five] on the Google Play store, so it has its fans,” Borrell said. “However, more people learned about Pokéman Go in one day than NextRadio could generate in several years, so it’s not quite yet the phenomenon the radio industry had hoped for either.” COSTS Activation of FM chips in smartphones has been an important goal for NextRadio. It secured sufficient backing from others in radio to promise Sprint $15 million per year beginning in 2013 over three years and to share revenue with the carrier; Sprint in turn agreed to embed the app in at least 30 million FM-enabled wireless devices on its wireless network over that period. A consortium of radio broadcasters including iHeartMedia, Beasley, CBS Radio, Greater Media, Radio One, Hubbard Radio, Townsquare Media, Bonneville and Entercom Communications has contributed to the payments to Sprint. In all, some 40 radio broadcast groups have paid into the fund, Brenner said. BEHIND NEXT The following radio broadcast groups have contributed financially to the NextRadio Sprint payments. Brenner said most paid according to a formula based on their revenues. ABC/Disney Alpha Broadcasting LLC Arbitron/Nielsen Beasley Broadcast Group Bonneville International Corp. Buckley Broadcasting Corp. Capitol Broadcasting Co. Inc. CBS Radio Cherry Creek Radio LLC Connoisseur Media Cox Media Group Crawford Broadcasting Co. Cumulus Media Holdings Inc. Delmarva Broadcasting Co. EMF Emmis Communications Entercom Entravision Communications Corp Federated Media Greater Media Inc Hearst Television Inc Hubbard Radio LLC iHeartMedia Inc. Jerry Lee Radio LLC Katz Lincoln Financial Media Co. Midwest Communications Inc. NextMedia Group Inc. Palm Beach Broadcasting License LLC Press Communications LLC Qantum Communications Corp Radio One Inc Renda Broadcasting Corp. Salem Communications Corp. Sarkes Tarzian Inc Sinclair Telecable Inc Spanish Broadcasting System Summitt Media Townsquare Media LLC Tyler Media Group Univision YMF Media LLC “This doesn’t include hundreds of medium and small broadcasters who have done barter deals through Westwood One and even more stations that continue to run promotional inventory for NextRadio,” Brenner said. “We’ve had immense support from all corners of the industry.” According to an Emmis Communications filing with the SEC earlier this year, NextRadio was in arrears with Sprint by $14 million at the end of 2015. It is working with the broadcasters and others, including NAB, to fund the remaining debt. Brenner said the amount due “is now lower than that” as NextRadio works with broadcasters to make sure they fulfill their obligations. “We have had to get a bit creative [with payments] in the homestretch,” Brenner said. “But it’s being taken care of.” Sprint did receive revenue-share dollars from the Home Depot campaign. A spokesperson for iHeartMedia who asked not to be named said the company continues to be the top supporter of NextRadio. “We have been the biggest financial backer [relative to the Sprint payments] of NextRadio and have contributed more financially than our share of the radio industry. Additionally, we have contributed more interactive stations and audience to NextRadio than any other company and have also lobbied on behalf of NextRadio with all major constituencies,” according to the spokesperson. After the agreement expires in August, Brenner said, “NextRadio will not be paying any cell carriers to activate the chip in smartphones. Instead, the new business model going forward will be a revenue sharing formula” tapping the revenue generated by TagStation, he said. Brenner said he expects the Sprint relationship will be extended under terms similar to those in place with AT&T and T-Mobile. Those revenue-sharing agreements provide carriers with a portion of the enhanced advertising sales in return for activating FM radio on smartphones or preloading the app. In 2017, he said, “I think you will see a big ramp-up in the number of cell phones supported in the market, followed by talk of revenue potential and advertiser interest.” Comment on this or any story to radioworld@nbmedia.com.

Apple has started transitioning its own listings for retail stores to remove the word “store,” and for new stores starting with the launch of its just opened San Francisco location that’s listed as “Apple Union Square”.  The changes build upon community and volunteering efforts we detailed earleir this year that Apple is pushing throughout its retail system.  We noted earlier this week that Apple was planning some retail changes with store meetings scheduled for this weekend: Hearing that there is a big deal Apple Retail Store meeting Sunday. Details coming soon to @9to5mac #credo — Seth Weintraub (@llsethj) August 17, 2016 Today’s report notes that Apple store employees have been notified of the gradual change taking place, although “Apple Store” doesn’t appear on signage in stores, it looks like the company will encourage employees to refer to locations without using the current “store” branding. It’s possible the move could be Apple’s attempt to promote Apple stores as more than just retail stores, considering the company hosts workshops, camps for kids, and other programs. And Apple’s latest store designs have implemented even more areas that go beyond the retail shopping experience. Notably, Apple’s new San Francisco store introduced a space it calls “The Forum,” described as a “vibrant gathering place, centered around a 6K Video Wall” used for public events and education sessions, and “The Plaza” to offer free public Wi-Fi and seating 24/7 to locals in an outdoors area that Apple is remodelling for the community. While there isn’t much consumer-facing signage that promotes the “Apple Store” brand, Apple does have its “Apple Store” app for iPhone and iPad that allows users to purchase products and accessories from its online store. It remains to be seen if the app name will follow suit with the retail store branding. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

By Matthew Miller for The Mobile Gadgeteer | August 18, 2016 -- 17:38 GMT (10:38 PDT) | Topic: Mobility Image: ZDNet iPhone owners often tell me they continue to buy new iPhones because of the Apple "ecosystem". That may have been true a few years ago, but if you are seeking innovation and an exciting spectrum of products that all work together, then you need to look to Samsung. Smartphone read this Forget Apple vs. Samsung. There's no stopping China in the smartphone war The problem comes down to industry commoditization. Read More A new Apple iPhone is likely going to be announced next month, with rumors indicating it will be very similar to the iPhone 6s, but it will not include a headphone jack. It may have some water resistance, a dual camera, and 1080p display resolution. My Samsung Galaxy Note 7 arrives today, and with this device, we see the pinnacle of smartphone innovation. The Note 7 has a 2k display that has been tested and awarded the title of best ever smartphone display, with full water resistance, an advanced S Pen and associated software, numerous battery charging options including fast wireless technology, and the best camera found on a smartphone. CNET Review: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is the sexiest large-screen phone ever Samsung has also stepped up to the security plate to establish a track record of timely monthly Android updates, across all wireless carriers. It offers a pared down TouchWiz experience with software enhancements that improve the user experience rather than overwhelm and confuse. The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 has 64GB of internal storage with the option to expand that via an inexpensive microSD card. The Note 7 sells for $850 with the comparable iPhone 6s Plus selling for the same price, but without the option to expand that 64GB of storage. Smartwatch The Apple Watch is an amazing smartwatch and leads the industry in smartwatch sales. The Samsung Gear S2 is also a fantastic smartwatch that offers more than the Apple Watch, including an integrated cellular radio. Next week we will see Samsung announce the rumored Gear S3 smartwatch, and it's sure to bring more innovation to your wrist. It's debatable whether there will ever be a market for a smartwatch, but as phones get larger and we spend more time on our mobile devices than with our computers, it is likely more will find value in a companion on their wrists. Apple and Samsung, among others, continue to focus on the smartwatch, and we will not see either company give up anytime soon. CNET Review: Samsung Gear S2 delivers a new spin on smartwatches Tablet Apple's iPad is the leading tablet even though Samsung has a number of options with unique technology. The difference in success with tablets comes down to the operating system, and currently, iOS offers more on the big mobile screen for the end user than Android. With iOS 10 though, Apple looks to be killing off support for long time iPad owners. Will these iPad owners look for another iPad, switch to an Android or Windows tablet, or not buy another one at all? Samsung has pushed the tablet experience further than Google with the OS with S Pen integration and other technology, but tablets appear more as an afterthought for Samsung. A couple years ago, there was an overwhelming number of Samsung tablets, but today most would be hard-pressed to identify the current leading Samsung Android tablet. We did see some innovation with the Samsung Galaxy View, and it appeals to cord cutters. However, an 18.4 inch tablet is not something everyone wants or needs. CNET Review: Samsung Galaxy Tab S2, a small and skinny tablet with a supreme screen Virtual reality There are rumors that Apple will be getting into virtual reality soon, but Samsung launched the Gear VR last year and has passed the one million mark already. I ordered the newest model Samsung Gear VR headset to use with my new Galaxy Note 7. Everyone who comes over to my house and uses the Gear VR is stunned by the experience, even resulting in a few running out to buy one themselves. Virtual reality may not yet be a necessity, but there are opportunities to use it for more than gaming and entertainment. As a professional naval architect, I could see using virtual reality to walk clients through ships we designed before any steel is ever cut at the yard.

Twitter Siri takes control as Apple's macOS Sierra beta arrives Mac users get a desktop OS they can talk to Michael deAgonia (Computerworld (US)) 08 July, 2016 06:00 - - - - print email Comments Less than a month after its unveiling at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in June, macOS Sierra arrived today for beta testers who have signed up to try Apple's new desktop operating system. This is the third year in a row Apple has offered a public beta of an upcoming desktop OS. This year the Mac platform gets some significant enhancements, with Sierra bringing one notable feature that promises to change how users interact with their Mac. After teasing users in 2015 with a revamped Spotlight in OS X El Capitan that understood sophisticated requests, Sierra finally brings Siri to the Mac. Siri's integration means you'll be able to control certain functions on your Mac using natural language voice commands, and Siri on the desktop is just as functional as Siri on the iPhone, and with Mac-specific tricks, too. From what I've seen using the early Sierra betas, I expect to be spending more time talking to my Mac. Michael deAgonia Siri is accessed from an icon in the Dock, by invoking a key command or from the menubar. Sierra gets more than just Siri Sierra isn't due out in final form until sometime this fall. But beta users, as of today, can check out the tweaks and additions the upgrade offers to make using your Mac a better experience. Those features include picture-in-picture for videos, better photo organization, improved device collaboration via the Universal Clipboard, iCloud Drive (which allows shared Desktop and Documents across all of your Apple devices), and Auto Unlocking your Mac when you wear your Apple Watch (running watchOS 3). macOS Sierra will allow Apple Watch users to unlock their Mac automatically. (The option is tucked away in the Security preferences.) But the biggest standout feature is Siri, which arrives on the desktop years after its debut as an app in iOS and then as a tent-pole feature for the iPhone platform. Apple now joins the ranks of other big-league developers, including Microsoft, Google and even Amazon, who are rapidly rolling out voice-activated features for their products. (FYI: Siri stacks up well against Cortana.) Before I get into more details about Sierra, a programming note: If you haven't signed up for Apple's beta program but would like to, you can do so here. Just a warning: this is a beta, so there will likely be issues if you're running this operating system. Apple still has months of work ahead to bring Sierra to its final, shipping form. Remember: before you rush to install it, always have a backup of your computer, and never use a beta on production-critical hardware. A Siri-ously big deal It's been five years since Siri's introduction on the iPhone. Since then, public acceptance of using voicing commands to control a device has slowly been on the rise. Amazon, Google and Microsoft all have virtual assistants now, and, for Apple's part, the Siri technology has been expanding the use of voice commands in a variety of devices. Siri has bounced from the iPhone to the iPad to Apple TV and CarPlay. If history is any indicator -- and by history, I mean Apple's other product releases -- Siri integration will absolutely change how you interact with the Mac -- even if you're still not sold on voice interaction. Why? Because over the years, Siri has learned platform-specific tricks that make interacting with devices much more effective. For instance, when Siri is prompted on the Apple TV for a specific show, Siri searches across all supported apps and displays the relevant results, saving you the trouble of opening and poking around for that specific show. And on Apple TV, rewinding and fast-forwarding to specific spots isn't much of an issue when you can tell Siri to just skip back or ahead with your voice. Siri will be no different. It's still as whimsical as it is on the iPhone (ask how it feels about living in a Mac and Siri might joke about living in an aluminum housing with no Windows). But there are a variety of new tricks that should be helpful for day to day users. Siri's new Preference pane under System Preferences allows you to customize it and change voices. Siri in use On the Mac, Siri is accessed from an icon in the Dock, by invoking a key command (Command-Space, by default) or from the menubar, next to the Notification and Spotlight icons. (The "Hey, Siri" voice invocation used in iOS - where Siri is always listening and can respond -- isn't yet an option on the desktop.) Michael deAgonia Siri can quickly deliver the latest weather forecast. Once active, you can use Siri to create appointments and reminders, send messages, ask for current or future weather forecasts, play a specific song (or an entire album or playlist), check sports scores, or even ask for directions. All of these requests work just as expected. However, I did have trouble getting Siri to bring up photos in my Photo Library, but I'm chalking this up as a bug. (Remember, as I've already noted: using a beta, even a public one, means you will likely encounter issues.) Siri still provides online and local searches, and when performing local searches, it recognizes Finder tags, dates and other attributes. That allows you to perform specific inquiries you'd normally turn to Spotlight for. Since Siri does a decent job following a particular train of thought, you can refine searches with follow-up questions or requests. Just don't be surprised if you get the occasional Siri sass. (During the WWDC keynote, Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, asked Siri to bring up some files he was looking for and she noted that his "data filin' was stylin'.") Even better, Siri can save your queries and the results in the Notification area for quick access later. That means everything from local file searches to sports scores can be pinned there for easy access later. And from these search widgets, you can keep track of specific files for that project you're working on, drag and drop the results into live documents, or simply store sports scores for current games you're interested in. Michael deAgonia Siri is aware of tags and can be used to find files using keywords Other changes in Sierra and final thoughts Of course Siri isn’t the only new feature in Sierra. Other useful additions include: The ability to play any video in a small window that hovers above your work Optimized storage, which can be used to free up space by clearing your hard drive of older files (and storing them in Apple’s iCloud servers for later retrieval, or, in the case of obsolete system files, removing them entirely). Advanced Continuity features that allow Apple devices to communicate and work more effectively with each other, including the new Universal Clipboard. This lets you copy data or a picture on your iPhone and paste it into a document on your Mac without using Messages, Notes or AirDrop. The ability to easily move data between Apple devices is coming, and it already works pretty well in the public beta. (Note: For this to work, every device needs to be running the latest beta software.) This feature alone might be worth the upgrade in the fall for many. When Siri was first released, I mused that any technology hoping to gain mass appeal had to be good enough to change someone's thought process from "Why are you using that?" to "Why aren't you using that?" Siri's capabilities and accuracy have grown over the years, and its features continue to evolve as the tech spreads from one Apple product to another. At the time, I wondered where the technology would go. Now we know the answer: on our Macs. And now you can try it for yourself, months before other Mac users get their shot.

Back in April, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was considering the option for cellular connectivity in the next Apple Watch version — something that I wasn’t sure the watch needed yet — but today’s report says the company has “hit roadblocks in making major changes that would connect its Watch to cellular networks and make it less dependent on the iPhone.” The report further corroborates rumors that the Apple Watch 2 will instead promote the addition of a built-in GPS, which doesn’t rely on cellular connectivity and makes new fitness features possible. For example, watchOS 3 and iOS 10, the upcoming software updates for Apple Watch and iPhone, add run mapping to the built-in Activity app on the iPhone for viewing past routes during workouts. Bloomberg notes that Apple was been in talks with carriers that would provide the connection to Apple Watches, but issues over battery life were in part to blame for the feature being saved for a future model instead of any upcoming updates. As 9to5Google reported last November, LG similarly had issues with its own LTE-connected smartwatch, although LG cited a faulty display component. A recent KGI report also described a second-generation Apple Watch which adds GPS and further waterproofing, but didn’t mention the rumored cellular radio. The Apple Watch 2 is expected to feature the same design as the current Apple Watch, which could get a minor speed bump and a price drop when the second-generation version is introduced. Apple is widely expected to be holding a media event early next month, possibly on September 7, where it could introduce new iPhone models as well as the updated Apple Watch lineup.

The company had planned to incorporate the technology and uncouple the Apple Watch from the iPhone, but ran into issues related to battery life. According to the report, Apple was in talks with carriers in the US and Europe about bringing the Apple Watch onto their networks, but made it clear that even if it was able to ship a cellular version of the wearable this year, it wouldn't have been released until December at the earliest. Apple's biggest concern has been the strain that cellular chips would put on the Apple Watch's battery life, and the company has reportedly begun looking into low-power cellular chips for future generations of the device. Although it's likely we won't get an Apple Watch with cellular connectivity this year, the company is expected to release new versions of the Watch with GPS connectivity and improvements to health tracking this fall.

Notably, the picture features both Birdman and Apple Music's Larry Jackson who now helps the company target artists, especially hip-hop/R&B ones, with exclusivity deal offers. It's unclear what exactly the deal with Cash Money Records entails. It could bring more exclusive releases to Apple Music or even involve content creation.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Hayley Tsukayama August 17 Follow @htsuka An person demonstrates the new Apple Pencil with the iPad Pro tablet computer in San Francisco on Sept. 9, 2015. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News) Apple, it seems, would like to see more tablets in briefcases next year. A new report from MacRumors cites noted Apple analyst Ming Chi-Kuo, who says there will be three new iPad models in 2017 — including a brand-new iPad Pro. The iPad Pro is an interesting device, introduced last year as something more than a tablet, though a bit less than a laptop. What do you call such a thing? Apple's currently making the case that the iPad Pro, which supports a keyboard and a stylus, is a “computer.” There’s a good reason to sell the iPad Pro as a “computer” rather than a tablet. Tablet sales have been slowing. And while computers are also in a sales slump, there is growth in the “detachables” category — devices that blend the tablet and the traditional laptop and have, well, a detachable keyboard. Casting the iPad Pro this way is important to Apple to catch the eye of businesses and business people, who may want something light but still functional for work. It is a bit of a departure from Apple’s past. Steve Jobs, Apple’s co-founder, famously disliked courting businesses. Per ZDNet, in 2010, Jobs told then-Wall Street Journal writers Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher: “What I love about the consumer market, that I always hated about the enterprise market, is that we come up with a product, we try to tell everybody about it, and every person votes for themselves. They go ‘yes’ or ‘no,’ and if enough of them say ‘yes,’ we get to come to work tomorrow. That’s how it works. It’s really simple. With the enterprise market, it’s not so simple. The people that use the products don't decide for themselves, and the people that make those decisions sometimes are confused.” Given that Jobs thought of Apple’s products as a counter to the computing grip that IBM and Microsoft had on offices, his disdain for the enterprise sector makes sense. But the business market has changed in ways that blunt Jobs’s old criticisms. He didn’t like that enterprise devices weren’t personal; that’s no longer the case in a BYOD world. Even when there’s a set list of devices approved by a workplace, it almost always includes an iPhone, an iPad or at least some iOS-friendly apps. And businesses are a great market for the tablet and the “post-PC” vision that Jobs envisioned with the introduction of the iPad. With a more mobile workforce, the iPad and the iPad Pro — along with the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and other 2-in-1 devices — make a lot of sense for moving from hotel room to living room to board room. It must also be said that the enterprise market isn't the only that's changed since Jobs vocally dismissed the sector. Apple has, too. Chief executive Tim Cook has made enterprise a key focus for Apple. And while some consumer enthusiasm for Apple's products has ebbed — Target reported its Apple sales were down 20 percent across the board this quarter — businesses are still buying enough to make Apple’s enterprise play a $25 billion business. In his recent interview with The Washington Post’s Jena McGregor, Cook specifically highlighted Apple’s enterprise market saying: We’re collaborating much better with key partners because it’s important, if you’re making a decision to use our products or anybody’s products in the enterprise, that they work well together. And so we’re working with Cisco because they’re incredible with the network infrastructure. We’re working with IBM, who’s written a number of apps. We’re working with SAP because they own the back of the house, in terms of the processing. They own three-quarters of the world’s transactions, in terms of it running on their products. This is an area, of course, that could fire up old rivalries — in fact, Microsoft has already released a commercial calling Apple’s “computer” claim into question and comparing the iPad Pro unfavorably to its own Surface Pro 4. The commercial raises some good points. The iPad Pro is still functionally a mobile device and lacks features such as multiple ports that traditional “computers” (and, of course the Surface Pro 4) do have. Then again, Apple has a line of laptops that only have one port, so there’s really no hard and fast definition of “computer” — and Apple’s clearly working hard to stretch the definition enough to fit the iPad Pro under the umbrella. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

By Daniel Matthews For anyone watching Apple’s ever-expanding role in the world of tech, it’s been an interesting year to say the least. And it just got more interesting. Apple is making Australian banks look petulant. Or, depending on how you look at it, the banks are making Apple look monopolistic. A “bloc” of Australian banks is petitioning the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to make Apple give them the secret to Apple Pay and NFC technology, the Register, a U.K. newspaper, reported last week.  NFC technology is near field communication, a type of RFID (radio frequency identification) that allows your cell phone to communicate with a credit card reader. Samsung, Walmart and Android have all patented their own contactless payment technology using NFC. So, why are the banks picking on Apple? Why can’t they hire someone to create their own contactless payment app? There’s something about Apple and its product that these banks view as a threat. Apple already sparred with the FBI in a case that seemed a lot more serious. Short synopsis: The FBI viewed Apple’s encryption as threat to security, because it protects killers’ information, such as that of San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook. Apple fought back, saying a backdoor to the iPhone equals a threat to consumer privacy. The FBI found a third-party hacker and dropped the case. There’s a trend here. Stakeholders want to crack into Apple’s technology and use the law (whether that law is an outdated All Writs Act or Australian Competition Law as referenced above) as their reason for access. But Apple has the power of the consumer — and the presumed protection of consumer privacy — on its side. The ACCC’s decision will see what type of pull Apple’s power has in Australia. Apple is using the potential threat to privacy and security as one of the reasons for rejecting the banks. If the banks get their hands on Apple’s NFC antenna, essentially piggy-backing off Apple Pay, they’ll be able to access information people have given to Apple. Credit card companies would be able to collect the fees Apple collects with each use of Apple Pay, and banks work hand-in-hand with creditors. Apple feels it has the right to the fees — it patented the app, and the app is integrated with the technology. Apple says the banks want to form a ‘cartel’ to give unfair advantage to the credit card companies. From the banks’ perspective, NFC is simply a type of technology. The people using Apple Pay NFC, they say, wouldn’t be able to use it without banks. In their logic, if people are going to use Apple Pay to access funds banks are holding, then banks deserve to profit from the use of the technology, not Apple. In this scenario, Apple becomes a mere go-between connecting consumers and banks. The problem with this argument is that Apple doesn’t have the patent on NFC. Apple isn’t saying the banks can’t develop their own NFC-based apps. The banks just can’t call their app ‘Apple Pay,’ and they can’t take advantage of an app that already has that name. The banks are confusing Apple’s app, which allows people to use NFC technology, with NFC technology itself.         This case represents the growing potential for disruption of the banking system by digital currency. On the blockchain and bitcoin side of the, uh, coin, digital currency has taught us that there’s an alternative to the centrally-managed banking system. If a peer-to-peer network with the right technology holds the keys to payments, in theory we don’t need banks. Check out the infographic below for a crash-course in digital currency: The technology that enables bitcoin is Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC). This hardware allows bitcoin miners to participate in the blockchain. Like NFC, blockchain is something anyone can use with the right hardware. The stage is set for banks. Just like with Apple Pay, with bitcoin and blockchain, you’re either in or you’re out. Plenty of banks have already decided they’re in on Apple Pay and NFC. But NFC is merely a different way of using the centralized system. Apple isn’t disrupting that system, just nudging it to include an unorthodox player. Bitcoin cryptocurrency, on the other hand, could disrupt the system.    Cryptocurrency’s value is speculative, based on factors such as how many people use it to replenish their wallet, issue salaries, or pay merchants. A Miami judge ruled that a man couldn’t have committed a crime with bitcoin, because it’s not real money. Where does this leave banks that are starting to take cryptocurrency seriously? There’s still the matter of value. People are ascribing value to cryptocurrencies. The blockchain is more secure than centralized banking, and security increases perceived value. Banks will want in on that value. But when banks decide they’re in on bitcoin — when they store it and centralize its exchange — bitcoin becomes vulnerable. That’s what happened with Bitfinex. The Hong Kong bitcoin bank got hacked to the tune of $77 million. Bitcoin’s value has since gone down. But it will go back up again as people continue to use it outside of any sort of hackable banking system. This presents a paradox for banks. They have to use bitcoin on the blockchain, not cached in a system. But using bitcoin on the blockchain — coming to cryptocurrency on its terms — undermines the centralized system on which banks rely. For one, it removes backup by the Federal Reserve Bank, which sets interest rates and insures funds against theft and borrower default. Compared to bitcoin, Apple Pay and other NFC applications present a relatively minor threat to banks. As the dispute in Australia demonstrates, Apple threatens the primacy of credit card companies more than banks. Chipping away at credit card processing fees is one thing. Decentralizing the system is another. Still, I don’t think we should underestimate what the Apple Pay dispute represents. The Australian banks, like the FBI before them, are sniffing out a power shift — and they don’t like it. Whoever holds the keys to ubiquitous technology, effective in each compartment of our lives, holds a level of power over the institutions that used to be only game in town.   Image credit: Flickr/iphonedigital Featured image: Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, courtesy of Tony The Tiger/Wikimedia Infographic courtesy of Northeastern University’s Online Master of Finance Program, used with permission Daniel Matthews is a freelance writer specializing in business, tech, and travel at the intersection of ethics and sustainability.

Gary Trent Jr., right, is leaving Apple Valley. Seeking tougher basketball competition, Apple Valley star guard Gary Trent Jr. is transferring to prep powerhouse Findlay Prep High School in Las Vegas for his senior season. The move to a top tier national program puts Trent, who averaged nearly 27 points per game last season, on an elite track to prepare for Division I basketball, with the hope of playing in the NBA like his father, Gary Trent Sr. He has told the Star Tribune previously that he would love to be a "one-and-done" college player, if he continues to develop and that becomes an option. Gary Trent Sr. said his son, who is being recruited by top college programs, wants to "play against elite competition every day in practice and every night in games.'' ''At the typical high school, most guys on the team are not going to play basketball after high school,'' Gary Trent Sr. said Friday. "And within the [conference], you may face one or two Division I players throughout the season. So the best preparation that we felt for Division I college basketball was to face a Division I player every day in practice and a Division I player in every game.'' His son announced his transfer via Twitter on Friday, saying that leaving Apple Valley was "the best decision for me'' and calling it "very difficult for my family.'' He expressed thanks to his teammates and coaching staff "for pushing beyond my limits. The last three years have been phenomenal and I have accomplished a lot on and off the court.'' Trent, who is being recruited by Minnesota, Duke, Kentucky, Kansas and Michigan State, led the USA men's U17 basketball team to a FIBA world championship on July 3 in Zaragoza, Spain. He scored a game-high 17 points to go along with four rebounds, two assists and two steals in the 96-56 championship rout over Turkey. Trent started all seven games and finished with an average of 12.7 points, the second-most on the team, and 3.9 rebounds per game. At Apple Valley Trent played varsity as an eighth-grader on a team that featured then-sophomore Tyus Jones and won a state title. As a sophomore he helped lead Apple Valley to another state championship in 2015. Trent led the team to the state semifinals in 2016. He exploded on the national scene in the summer of 2015, when he led a top-tier AAU circuit in scoring and earned MVP honors in an international tournament for USA Basketball. Recruiting analysts ranked Trent among the nation's top juniors. Apple Valley coach Zach Goring said he met with Trent after the 2016 season "and he was real honest and right up front about'' looking at attending a prep school next year. "JR wants to be pushed every single day in practices and games against the best possible competition,'' said Goring, adding that Trent's 6-6 size makes it hard to find players who can push him at practice. "I don't blame him at all. I told him that.'' Trent is the second Minnesota prep basketball star of late to leave during high school to attend Findlay Prep. Rashad Vaughn left Cooper High School to play his senior season there in 2014-15. Vaughn turned professional after attending the University of Nevada-Las Vegas for one year. "It was a very hard decision for my son to leave home but it was going to happen either this year or the next year going to college,'' Gary Trent Sr. said. "It's our job as parents to prepare our children for whatever lies ahead of them in life. And to me, this was the best preparation he can get basketball-wise.''

Upcoming iPhone By Haider Khan Published on 09/08/2016 Share Tweet Comment Ever thought how the upcoming iPhone would be? So some changes are expected in the coming new iPhone. Apple Inc. is expected to make changes to one of the basic component that is more frequently used; that is the button. Advertisement Mark Gurman, one of the well known Apple reporters in the world, frequently reports the latest news about iPhone. He says in the article: “[The] new models will have a pressure-sensitive button that provides feedback to the user via a vibrating haptic sensation rather than a true physical click, according to the people.” So according to him, Apple Inc. is going to make much variation to the home button. It won’t actually be a button but will be appear as a button, giving a similartouch sensation as of an ordinary button. Although physical gadget components like buttons and switches give the user a more realistic actual feeling. For instance, to give the iPhone a reboot the side button is to be pressed long the power button. So this new technology might be not pleasant to some users. If we talk in depth of the modified button, then we will have to agree to the fact that it would be a bit more difficult to fix the upcoming iPhones. Due to this very reason, many users of Apple products kvetch the idea of “planned obsolescence” because this way the company intentionally manufactures its products so that they are much harder to fix. This way it makes more money by selling new hardware. There seems to be no good turnarounds to this because unlike other smartphones third-party companies won’t be easily able to replace parts for the upcoming iPhone. Simply without an actual button, it will be harder for users to control the phone, when getting in and out of it. In February we had already seen that new home button, due to its complex functionality, created usage problems for some iPhone users. Due to frequent use of home button, its life period tends to end. So many customers wanted to replace the button, but unfortunately that was not easily possible. But the company gave security excuses as the reason of making such a button so that no one tampers with it. The only turnaround then remains is that customers have to replace their iPhones from Apple Inc., which is something good to know. However there are also many pros of this newer gadget construction. Firstly, it leaves almost no room for dust, sand etc. to get into the phone making it safe from many hardware hazards.Also less need remains to clean it manually. Secondly, Apple Inc. has been trying to compete world’s other smartphones in making their products much more water-resistant. One of the world’s most commonly used smartphones i.e. Android phones have also shifted to use software buttons. This way much more room is available for screen for handier work. The three buttons in Android viz. Options Menu, Home and Back buttons only appear to the user when in use. The Apple Inc. has already introduced this soft-button technology in its MacBooks and the 3D touch of iPhone. Such buttons can work in more than one dimension on flat screens giving much more functionality than ordinary buttons. Smartphone have always been changing and losing buttons. Firstly, the dial pads, then the “call/end” buttons were removed. Now we are also going to miss much more buttons we were used to. So we’ll have to primarily play around with a touch screen only.

The company barely mentioned business users or developers during the opening keynote, but it did introduce several improvements that should have far-reaching implications for enterprise coders and IT. Matt Kapko (CIO (US)) 21 June, 2016 05:09 - - - - print email Comments Apple says it takes the enterprise more seriously today than ever before, and it has backed that claim with the release of a number of new business solutions during the past years. However, Apple's enterprise efforts were barely noticeable at the company's annual developer conference last week. Apple did not completely ignore the enterprise at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), but it also didn't make any significant business-focused announcements. The company mentioned enterprise only once, in passing, during its two-hour opening keynote, but some of the APIs in the upcoming iOS 10 software, discussed in technical sessions later during the conference, will enable new capabilities for many user types, including IT professionals. For example, the iOS 10 software development kit lets businesses build apps that integrate with iMessage, Siri and Maps. And enhancements to iCloud, Touch ID and a new common file system that syncs across iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS, called Apple File System, should also enable developers to build better business apps. Apple's enterprise pacts slowly (but surely) pay off Apple's partnership with Cisco, announced last August, will bear some new fruit in iOS 10. Cisco's Spark collaboration app will tap into Apple's new mobile OS to integrate with native iOS calling features, so calls placed via the app will look and feel like calls made using Apple's native phone app. Cisco customers will be able to make and receive calls on iOS devices over corporate networks, and IT managers can give Cisco apps network priority over other non-critical apps to ensure the best possible user experience. [Related: iPhones are about to get plugged into enterprises with Cisco's help] Apple also made notable progress in the enterprise market since it inked an alliance with IBM almost two years, and it followed up with deals with Cisco and SAP. The company has been busy, but it could do more to highlight its strengths to businesses, according to Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. "I believe Apple could have mentioned enterprise more than it did [during WWDC] if it wanted to reiterate its enterprise aspirations," he says. Apple's enterprise efforts stay behind the scenes at WWDC Travis Fischer, director of engineering at ChaiOne, an enterprise design firm and member of Apple's mobility partners program, attended WWDC, and he says he wasn't surprised when enterprise was mostly overlooked during the keynote. The WWDC keynote is "less about sharing new and exciting things for the developers and more about sharing news with the rest of the consumer world about the next versions of Apple's various [platforms]," Fischer says. "This is the first shot of Apple's sales pitch for new phones in the fall." [Related: What Apple's new open stance means for iOS apps] Apple's keynote is the most public-facing WWDC event, but it's also the least significant for attendees, according to Fischer. "Developers come to WWDC to learn about the guts of the flashy things mentioned at the keynote and how they can use the new tools and libraries in their apps." The company didn't address business developers specifically, but it introduced several improvements that could be useful to them, Fischer says, including the new iOS APIs. "You don't have to call someone by name for them to know you're talking directly to them." Apple geared the majority of technical demonstrations at WWDC toward consumers, but changes to its underlying technology will impact enterprise developers, according to Moorhead. The company's decision to open up its most popular native iOS apps to external developers also has strong implications for the enterprise, he says. "Route drivers could have simplified maps and directions to reach their destination … Siri could be used by food handlers to invoke the right recipes or instruction manuals without touching the phone … [and] iMessage could be linked to a bot to answer questions and ask the right questions," Moorhead says. [Related: Apple's enterprise partnerships, big and small, start to pay off] So while the company didn't make many big business announcements at WWDC, it didn't have to, according to Fischer. Apple is already bringing its well-known "consumer experience to the enterprise worker," he says. "Apple doesn't need to court the enterprise with splashy announcements or new tools."

Innovation Excellence The World's Most Popular Innovation Web Site Home About Us Advertise IX Weekly Reading List Innovation Research Contact Us Apple – A Rare Case of Sustainable Competitive Advantage by Idris Mootee Apple has built a truly sustainable competitive advantage and is definitely worth the current valuation premium. If you’ve just upgraded your iPhone you will not be happy if Apple is bringing out a new one in a few short months. In addition to launching both iPhone 5 and iOS 5, there will be the new iTunes 11 bought to you from the Cloud. Expect a very clean design and iCloud will be closely integrated with iTunes. iTunes Store is actually turning into a browser (funny without we seeing it that way) and it will actually be integrated into the entire app. Your music will be backed up by the Cloud and everything will be fully synced. It is harder and harder to beat Apple with its deep integration between apps, OS and devices. It is reported that iCloud will be offered for free initially, and at some point users will be charged $25 annually for subscription of the service. That’s another way to get another recurring revenue stream just like MobileMe service. Apple has finally locked-in deals with big record labels Warner, EMI, Sony, and Universal. With 30% of revenue from iCloud’s music offering with the major labels, 12% with those holding the songwriting rights, and the remaining 58% for Apple to keep. That’s a good profit margin. Not only it is helping with the bottom line, it is further stengthening the Apple fortress with all these integration. Apple is building a fortress around its suite of product/services/experiences and it is almost impossible to break that. It is not only around music and devices. They have just filed a patent application that an iProjector that I believe is in the making. It makes perfect sense, a mini-size slim projector that sells for $600 to $1,000 and most of them have problems with setting up. And you thought it should be easy. I will not think for a second of getting one if it is fully integrated with my MacBook or iPhone or iPad. With interactive presentations and sharable contents between devices…. and not to mention a really good looking Apple design. The patent application “Projected display shared workspaces” was filed in February 2010 and it is basically a system for taking what’s on screen and projecting it onto a nearby surface such as a wall etc. The true innovation is that about the system proposed in this filing is that it can combine projections from multiple devices into one screen, in what’s dubbed the “shared workspace.” So you can simultaneously show power point from your computer, a video from your iPhone and notes from your iPad. No switching between apps anymore. Called it a “presentation canvas”? Apple’s horizontal integration strategy across devices and channels and vertical integration strategy from chip design to software and retail is creating a truly sustainable competitive advantage that is hard to replicate. For that reason alone, its valuation skyrocketed. This is a brilliant example of classic business strategy theory at work. Every single Apple products complement (compete) and complete each other. Get an iPod, and you can download content via iTunes and access them though iCloud and use that to move content to iPad or other devices. The sort of control over the entire user experience or process, from hardware to software, strengthens customer loyalty and provide lock-in. You cannot leave Apple once you’re in. It is becoming the consumer equivalent of IBM for business. Don’t miss an article (3,000+) – Subscribe to our RSS feed and join our Innovation Excellence group!

Skip to main content Apple Valley Review Main menu Home Arrest Logs Classifieds Community Events Contact Us Opinion Roy's 100th You are here Home Standing tall for America: Apple Valley man carries American flag around High Desert hoping to unite the people August 3, 2016 By Rene De La Cruz APPLE VALLEY — As the hot summer sun beats down, a sweaty Phil Beaumont carries a large American flag down Bear Valley Road as commuters speed by. The 60-year-old Beaumont is hesitant to speak with the Daily Press at first, but says his “love for God, country and the American people” motivates him to speak out. “I carry this flag because I love America and I want people to know that every day is Independence Day,” said Beaumont, who lives in Apple Valley and began his daily walks throughout the High Desert about two years ago. “This flag represents a united people, but we’re not united and that’s a big problem.” Wearing a medical walking boot on his right foot because of an injured Achilles tendon, Beaumont claims the biggest enemy to America is the government, which “perpetrates criminal activity upon the people,” including veterans, seniors, the sick, the homeless and the underprivileged who “suffer at the hands of the government.” “We’re taxed to death, they kicked God out of school, they take rights away from parents and they straight up lie to the people,” said Beaumont, who told the Daily Press he has a second home in the Philippines. “Veterans are not cared for and our seniors are second-class citizens.” Wearing a patriotic hat and T-shirt, Beaumont said he carries a hydration pack as he walks along Bear Valley Road, Highway 18 and other High Desert roadways. “Remember, it’s one nation under God, by the people, for the people,” Beaumont said. “We need to take this nation back before it’s too late. Stand tall, America.” Beaumont says he believes it may have been “untreated veterans with problems” who were behind the recent shootings and killings of several police officers in Baton Rouge and Dallas. “I don’t have much to say about (the) 'Black Lives Matter' (movement) because I believe there is no color or racism with God,” Beaumont said. “But those shootings were caused because those veterans had untreated problems.” A retired construction worker and real estate agent, Beaumont said surviving a medical scare had him giving his heart to Jesus, and picking up his “cross and American flag” and “speaking up for the downtrodden.” He added that he’s not asking people to revolt against the government, but to “stand tall for your rights.” Beaumont said “government intrusion” in every aspect of American life “has also led this country down the road to disobedience and destruction.” “We live in blessed country and we need to take a stand for it,” Beaumont said. “The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing."

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « According to Korean Press, Apple Music is a Failure | Main | HP's New Omen X Gaming PC Borrows from the NeXTcube Concept » August 17, 2016 Target Reports that their Electronic Sales Crashed 75% this Quarter Due to Apple Device Slump   Apple's revenues were down 14.6% year-over-year this past quarter, with iPhone sales roughly down 18%, half of the drop that Xiaomi experienced this quarter. Yet somehow that drop in Apple device sales translated to a drop of 75% of Target stores electronics sales collapse this quarter, reports MarketWatch. According to the report, "Target CEO Brian Cornell blamed Apple's product line for three-quarters of its quarterly decline in electronics sales Wednesday, and said Target is now working to help Apple 'accelerate innovation' to improve sales.   Target didn't specifically call out the iPhone, saying instead the decline was "across the [Apple] product suite." In addition to the iPhone, Target sells iPods, iPads, Apple Watches and Beats accessories. Apple doesn't break out watch or headphone sales specifically, but third-party data suggested watch sales fell as much as 55%.   Cornell said Target is "actively addressing" the challenges, which includes "collaborating with Apple and other vendor partners" to evolve its electronics offerings. Mark Tritton, Target's new chief merchandising officer, has been working with Apple to figure out how to position the new products Apple is expected to unveil this fall in a way that helps it improve second-half electronics sales, he said.   "We over-index with Apple products. Our guests come to us looking for those products. They're looking for the newness and the innovation," said Cornell. "We're putting together plans with Apple and our merchandising teams to make sure we're ready to take advantage of that in the back half of the year."   Shares of Target fell 6.2% to $70.82 in afternoon trade, pushing them down 3.8% in the past three months and 10.3% in the past year.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.     Posted by Jack Purcher on August 17, 2016 at 06:17 PM in 5.

Microsoft (MSFT) Gets Its Groove Back, Surpassing Apple (AAPL)? Is Microsoft (MSFT) Out-Innovating Apple (AAPL)? Research firm makes a bold statement on Apple’s frenemy. August 18, 2016 Cristina Lee For decades, frenemy Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have been competing against each other in a variety of industries, particularly in the software and hardware segment. Having been surpassed by Apple since the release of the iPhone, it seemed as if the once-formidable tech company that Bill Gates co-founded, was permanently relegated to playing second fiddle due to the lack of innovation. But no more. Microsoft rose from the ashes, poised to go head to head with Apple, at least according to tech company, Good & Co. The firm presented a study showing that, Microsoft employees are “significantly more innovative than many assume, and on par with tech giants such as Apple and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB)” Good & Co. developed a “self-discovery platform and network for a new generation of professionals looking for more meaning in their careers.” The study was based on Good & Co.’s algorithm that directs people to the right job. It measures the creativity and innovation of a person based on personality traits, including adventurousness and curiosity. Good & Co. says the results were based on assessed data from its 4,364 app users to “explore ways in which psychometric data can inform our understanding of workplace behavior company culture, and success in the tech industry.” The company also said that Microsoft is ahead in a number of surprising areas: “The creators of Microsoft Office had an almost identical score to Apple in regards to employee adventurousness.” Good & Co concluded that the Redmond tech firm “proved to put a focus on hiring adventurous candidates.” “Employees at Apple and Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR) perceive their company cultures as they actually are, meaning they have an accurate idea of the culture fit in their respective jobs,” the research notes. But take Good & Co.’s data with a grain of salt. According to lead author Dr. Kerry Schofield, although Microsoft is faring well, in terms of developing innovative products and that it has established a more innovative culture, its employees are “no less adventurous than Apple employees.” She added, “Overall, on our zero-100 scale Microsoft scores less than 1 point lower than Apple on adventurousness.” Although Apple is one point behind Microsoft in innovation, Good & Co. said its employees are trumping the latter “on a number of traits vital for success.” These traits include “intellectual curiosity” and “attention to detail.” Schofield added, “Apple managers and other employees score higher on [intellectual] curiosity than Microsoft’s. Further analysis found that this holds true mainly for male employees only. For women, there is only a marginal difference.” But how will the results hold up once Apple launches its flagship smartphone, the iPhone 7, sometime in September? No one really knows. Insiders believe that if the next iPhone turns out to be a great disappointment, then there’s a possibility that Microsoft will finally take the title as the most innovative of all tech companies, something that hardcore iPhone fan boys might find hard to swallow.

The discovery of the problem was discovered by a team of researchers from the Johns Hopkins University led by Christina Garman, a team which also included famous cryptography expert Matthew Green. Since that time Apple added a series of short and long-term defenses to the iMessage protocol. Apple was made aware of the problem as early as November 2015.   Since then, Apple has been pushing mitigations recommended by the researchers through monthly updates to several of its products. Most of the repairs were included in iOS 9.3 and OS X 10.11.4, which shipped in March 2016. The problem could have only been hacked by state-sponsored level actors, the report noted.   A full list of short and long-term mitigations that researchers proposed could be found in their researcher paper called Dancing on the Lip of the Volcano: Chosen Ciphertext Attacks on Apple iMessage, in section 7. You could access the paper/PDF here. The paper was made public earlier this week at the USENIX Security Symposium, Austin, Texas.

All Features the latest // Status Ain't Hood E-40 Is A National Treasure Songs Videos Lists Share < br />this article: But Who's Buying? No Control: Thoughts On The End Of The Headphone Jack And The Future Of Digital Music Michael Nelson @nelsonicboom | August 12, 2016 - 11:29 am Share < br />this article: Do you know who Lyor Cohen is? This isn’t a rhetorical question. I have no perspective here. If you work in the music business, he’s a household name. If you don’t work in the music business, why the fuck would you care about some corporate executive? But maybe, in this case, you actually would care, because Cohen’s a significant enough figure that he sorta transcends that. Anyway, real quick: Lyor Cohen played an instrumental role in bringing rap to mainstream audiences in the ’80s. He headed up Def Jam Records in the ’90s. He was chairman and chief executive of Warner Music Group in the ’00s. He’s Jay Z’s mentor. That’s not just some unattributed thing people say because they heard someone else say it. That’s a thing Jay Z said in his own 2010 autobiography, Decoded. So maybe you already knew Lyor Cohen, maybe not, but either way, you know him now. Last week, The Guardian ran a lengthy feature on Cohen, which was full of anecdotes and insights, including this spicy bit of invective directed at another iconic corporate executive whom you definitely know: My firsthand experience with Steve [Jobs] was that he was determined and was going to get only what he wanted. And he was a bully. He was very seductive, but a profound bully. And oftentimes he did not say the truth. I.e., Jobs “did not say the truth” in regard to his dealings with the music industry at the dawn of the iTunes era. Now, Cohen is by no means the first C-suite guy to speak ill of Jobs. It was only nine months ago that Pandora CFO Mike Herring told us, “Steve Jobs eviscerated the music industry with the launch of iTunes and it’s been downhill ever since.” But something about what Cohen said struck a chord with me: a person who had zero firsthand experience with Steve Jobs, but was nonetheless in the trenches at that particular moment in time. Do you remember when iPods first came out? Back in the day, they came wrapped in this clear protective tape, on the front of which was printed the command: “Don’t steal music.” My friend Todd and I used to laugh about that. In the early 2000s, selling shiny new iPods to computer-literate music lovers and telling them, “Don’t steal music,” was like selling a giant pile of drugs to a couple of college sophomores and telling them, “D.A.R.E. to resist.” The message was either motivated by some bargaining-with-God-style karmic anxiety or intended as a 100-percent ironic endorsement to do the very opposite, but in any case, it was clearly not sincere, and in no way whatsoever did it intend or expect to serve as an actual deterrent. “Seductive”? Yes. “Did not say the truth”? Also yes. Anyway, thinking about old iPods and Lyor Cohen and Jay Z and Steve Jobs got me thinking about this tweet from Kanye West from a few weeks back: Apple give Jay his check for Tidal now and stop trying to act like you Steve. — KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) July 30, 2016 But what if they’re not “acting” like anything? People always say that Tim Cook’s Apple has nothing in common with Steve Jobs’ Apple, but maybe, really, the two men’s respective styles are not so different? *** I’m not talking about Tidal. I’d love to, naturally, and we will absolutely get to that in the not-so-distant future, but today we’re just talking about Apple. Starting here: Earlier this week, Bloomberg Technology further substantiated something we’ve all been speculating about for a while now: The iPhone 7, which is set to arrive this fall (just in time for Boys Don’t Cry!), very likely won’t have a standard headphone jack. Per Bloomberg: “The new iPhones will remove the headphone jack in favor of connectivity via Bluetooth and the charging port. That will make room for a second speaker [according to people familiar with the matter, who didn’t want to be identified discussing unannounced features].” “Bully”? Yep. “Determined and going to get only what they want”? Again, yes. If the rumors are to be believed, when the new phones hit stores, they’ll be bundled with EarPods that connect to the charging port (aka the “Lightning Connector”) so iPhone users won’t be left with nothing. But EarPods are as close to nothing as you can possibly buy on the headphones market. Anyway, here’s what they’ll (supposedly) look like: If you listen to music on an iPhone and don’t care for bottom-of-the-market EarPods, this creates a whole lot of logistical problems on day one. The headphones you currently own are now basically obsolete. You do have a workaround there: You can buy a Lightning-to-3.5mm headphone jack adapter — called a “dongle,” in case you have to ask the guy at Best Buy where to find ‘em — but that’s far from ideal. First of all, those things won’t exactly be free; they’ll probably retail somewhere between $30 and $40. (That said, it’s not out of the question that you’ll get one for free — several sites have shared rumors that Apple will bundle a single dongle with each new iPhone.) Second, those dongles are gonna be real easy to lose, probably not all that hard to break, and will just be a general headache to keep track of in your pockets or bag or whatever. You’ll eventually be able to buy off-brand dongles at your local bodega or Duane Reade, but if you’ve ever bought an off-brand charger at your local bodega or Duane Reade, you know how that goes. (BTW, I am aware that the phrase “Apple will bundle a single dongle” sounds ridiculous, and I intentionally wrote it to sound as ridiculous as possible. I can’t even type the word “dongle” without feeling ridiculous, and when situations like that arise, IMO, you just gotta lean into ‘em.) So ANYWAY, let’s be real clear: The intention here is not for you to use a dongle. Alternately, you can switch to Bluetooth headphones — in fact, maybe you already use Bluetooth headphones. I do. I own a pair and I hate ‘em. Why? For starters, it’s no given that your phone will “find” your headphones, which can be pretty infuriating. Plus you have to be constantly vigilant about keeping the headphones’ battery charged … and of course, battery life diminishes over time. (I think I get eight hours of battery life out of my Bluetooth headphones, which are admittedly not the greatest.) Fail to stay on top of that and you run the risk of your headphones dying in the middle of a workout or a long walk or whatever. The intention here is also not for you to use Bluetooth headphones. I mean, one day? Sure. But not yet. No, the intention here is for you to buy new headphones — Apple-supported headphones that will be compatible with the iPhone’s Lightning Connector — and not just once but whenever: whenever you break a pair or lose a pair or forget to bring a pair on vacation… And you know who owns the biggest headphones brand in the world? Yeah you do. On that note, lemme throw this one to Bloomberg again: Apple started allowing headphone makers to build headphones that can connect via the iPhone’s charger connector in 2014, the same year the company acquired headphone maker Beats Electronics. That’s great, right? They “started allowing” it. You know who wasn’t so in love that idea? Headphone makers. As MacWorld wrote back in 2014, the rest of the audio industry largely resisted Apple’s invitation to revamp entire product lines to service a single piece of hardware that was bound to be updated again in a few years anyway. Still, as MacWorld noted, choosing not to participate came with its own set of risks: [Having acquired Beats Electronics], Apple will be able to trot out headphones of its own that use Lightning. Then, if others want in, they would be at a disadvantage, price-wise, because they’d have to pay licensing and royalty fees to enter Apple’s MFi (Made For…) program, while Apple/Beats would not. Sucks for those other guys, right? Not just them, though. *** Nobody has been more vocal in their antipathy for the jackless iPhone than Verge Editor-In-Chief Nilay Patel, who authored a pretty vitriolic essay on the subject a couple months ago titled “Taking The Headphone Jack Off Phones Is User-Hostile And Stupid.” Really, Patel’s piece wasn’t an essay so much as a list: six reasons why this practice is user-hostile and stupid. At the top of the list was this: 1. Digital audio means DRM audio I’m just gonna excerpt Patel here and then try to contextualize the best I can: For years the entertainment industry has decried what they call the “analog loophole” of headphone jacks, and now we’re making their dreams come true by closing it. Restricting audio output to a purely digital connection means that music publishers and streaming companies can start to insist on digital copyright enforcement mechanisms. We moved our video systems to HDMI and got HDCP, remember? Copyright enforcement technology never stops piracy and always hurts the people who most rely on legal fair use, but you can bet the music industry is going to start cracking down on “unauthorized” playback and recording devices anyway. We deal with DRM when it comes to video because we generally don’t rewatch and take TV shows and movies with us, but you will rue the day Apple decided to make the iPhone another 1mm thinner the instant you get a “playback device not supported” message. First, those acronyms: DRM is Digital Rights Management; HDMI is High-Definition Multimedia Interface, and HDCP is High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection. HDMI/HDCP is a pretty good point of reference here, but I’m not gonna go long on that, because this is plenty long already. If you want to learn more about HDMI and HDCP, here’s a pretty decent primer, and here’s the nut: “Unbeknownst to most consumers there’s an anti-piracy protocol [called HDCP] built right into the HDMI cable standard. Not only does it have a poor track record when it comes to piracy prevention it outright breaks the viewing experience for many people.” OK, so … DRM. On its face, DRM exists to protect copyrights holders against piracy, which is a worthy goal. It’s never proven effective in that capacity, but we’ll come back to that. Beyond that, DRM is vastly fucking complicated, because it’s an intersection of technology, law, business, and ethics, and you could write books on its implications in each of those areas. Well, someone could. Maybe you. Not me. In 2014, Cory Doctorow wrote a substantial feature on DRM for The Guardian, calling it “one of the most salient, and least understood, facts about technology in the contemporary world.” I’m doing you, him, and myself a disservice by reducing his 5,000-word story to its five broadest sentences, but it’s better than nothing, so here goes: DRM isn’t the right to prevent piracy: It’s the right to make up your own copyright laws. The right to invent things that people aren’t allowed to do — even though the law permits it — and to embed these prohibitions in code that is illegal to violate … DRM assumes that the computer’s owner is its adversary. For DRM to work, there has to be no obvious way to remove, interrupt or fool it. For DRM to work, it has to reside in a computer whose operating system is designed to obfuscate some of its files and processes: to deliberately hoodwink the computer’s owner about what the computer is doing. Look, I know. I know this stuff makes no sense. It’s supposed to make no sense. That’s not a bug, it’s a feature! But the thing is, there are plenty of bugs, too. It’s not that DRM is bad — copyrights holders absolutely should be protected — it just that at best it doesn’t do what it’s ostensibly intended to do. Here’s a real-life example: For the first six years of its existence, from 2003 through 2009, the iTunes store was forced by major labels to sell only DRM-encumbered song files. As Wired put it: “Terrified music labels essentially decided we were all thieves and couldn’t be trusted. Because of that paranoia, when the iTunes store launched, all the songs were wrapped in DRM.” But the labels slowly came around — in part because they realized they were giving up a whole lot more than they were getting. As Ars Technica’s Eric Bangeman wrote in 2006: It appears that the record labels are slowly beginning to realize that they can’t have DRMed music and complete control over the online music market at the same time. For years, the labels have insisted that nearly all music sold online contain DRM due to fears over piracy and file-sharing. That insistence ultimately left the labels reliant on other companies to come up with DRM solutions capable of pleasing both consumers and the music industry. Hence the dominance of Apple, the iPod, and the iTunes Store in the online music scene. So there you go. That’s one example of DRM not working. It started in 2003, and by 2006, people were “slowly beginning to realize” it was costing them. They waited a few more years to change it, and they’re still paying for it today. The real reason DRM became an untenable burden to the labels, though, is because it became an untenable burden to their customers, i.e., you. Music pirates continued to pirate music — partly because that’s what pirates do, but also because pirating was a better user experience, because those files had no restrictions. The DRM-encumbered files purchased on iTunes were restricted to usage on a maximum of five computers, and while they could be played back on as many iPods as you wanted, they could only be played back on iPods. No other MP3 device and/or software could play those songs unless the “owner” went through the labyrinthine process of burning the songs to CD, stripping them of their DRM, and then re-ripping the files from those CDs. Even after the labels finally gave up on DRM, those old files proved problematic: You still had to use iTunes Match to manually remove the protection yourself (a quick five-step process). Weirdly, when Apple Music launched, it incorrectly wrapped all the old files its users hadn’t bought from iTunes in DRM, meaning “the music you’ve accumulated over the years outside of iTunes becomes unplayable if you ever cancel your Apple Music subscription and don’t have iTunes Match to keep it with you.” (Fixing this required only a six-step process.) So in a way, you’re still paying for it, too. *** The most passed-around piece ever written in opposition to DRM audio was penned by none other than Steve Jobs himself: a 2007 essay called “Thoughts On Music.” The whole thing is worth reading, but I’m just gonna pull out a few key lines. Here’s one: When Apple approached [the “big four” music companies] to license their music to distribute legally over the Internet, they were extremely cautious and required Apple to protect their music from being illegally copied. The solution was to create a DRM system, which envelops each song purchased from the iTunes store in special and secret software so that it cannot be played on unauthorized devices. Here’s another: The problem, of course, is that there are many smart people in the world, some with a lot of time on their hands, who love to discover such secrets and publish a way for everyone to get free (and stolen) music. They are often successful in doing just that, so any company trying to protect content using a DRM must frequently update it with new and harder to discover secrets. It is a cat-and-mouse game. And one more: Why would the big four music companies agree to let Apple and others distribute their music without using DRM systems to protect it? The simplest answer is because DRMs haven’t worked, and may never work, to halt music piracy. In time, the labels came to agree with Jobs. And in 2009, the iTunes Music Store went DRM-free. This came as a result of a compromise with the labels, who agreed to abandon DRM-encumbered files only if Apple would agree to variable pricing in the iTunes store. As MacWorld wrote in 2009: “Did Apple cave to the recording industry? If you define ‘Apple caving to the recording industry’ as ‘prices increasing for new and popular tunes,’ then yes, Apple caved.” That’s not really “caving,” of course, because the higher prices meant additional revenue not only for the labels, but for Apple too. But it was kinda caving, because Apple wasn’t really in it for the royalties — Apple wanted to sell iPods, and needed the labels to be on board. Never forget: With that in mind, consider just one more line from Jobs’ “Thoughts On Music”: The [optimal] alternative is to abolish DRMs entirely. Imagine a world where every online store sells DRM-free music encoded in open licensable formats. In such a world, any player can play music purchased from any store, and any store can sell music which is playable on all players. This is clearly the best alternative for consumers, and Apple would embrace it in a heartbeat. If the big four music companies would license Apple their music without the requirement that it be protected with a DRM, we would switch to selling only DRM-free music on our iTunes store. Every iPod ever made will play this DRM-free music. Two years after he wrote that piece, Jobs’ imaginary world was made real. And two years after that, he passed away. Fast-forward to 2015, a week before the launch of Apple Music and a year before the Verge’s Nilay Patel wrote the aforementioned “Taking The Headphone Jack Off Phones Is User-Hostile And Stupid.” That week, last June, Patel wrote a different essay, sorta foreshadowing the new one, titled “Apple Music And The Terrible Return Of DRM.” You should read that one in full, too, but here’s the key line: It’s no longer the labels pushing DRM on the music services; it’s the services themselves, because locking you into a single ecosystem guarantees you’ll keep paying their monthly subscription fees and hopefully buy into the rest of their ecosystem … Apple Music might be available on Android, but it probably won’t be as good, because Apple wants you to buy an iPhone. Whether by coincidence or design, Patel was right about Apple Music on Android: The app just exited beta last week, and version 1.0 is in the Play Store now with an average rating of 3.3 stars. Per TechCrunch: “[W]hen you look at the Play Store ratings, it says that the app is still crippled with bugs. Music doesn’t play, downloaded songs get randomly removed, and the app crashes a lot.” It’s also no secret that Apple hasn’t exactly made it easy for Spotify to establish a foothold among iPhone users. So I think Patel is right, too, in his broader assertions about Apple “locking you into a single ecosystem … and hopefully buy[ing] into the rest of their ecosystem.” Why wouldn’t they do that? After all, it is a huge ecosystem — just on the music end, right now, Apple is acting as a streaming service, a hardware manufacturer, a de facto record label, a record store (for now), a radio station, a PR firm, a video production agency, and an on-demand streaming video provider (am I missing anything?) — and its room for growth is equally massive. As Forbes notes, “Apple has upwards of a billion devices in use currently, and it also had about 800 million iTunes accounts with credit cards on file (as of April 2014). This implies that fewer than 2 percent of Apple’s iTunes account holders are actively paying for the Music service.” That’s a whole lot of credit cards not getting charged 10 bucks a month for an Apple Music subscription. Not yet. Would Steve Jobs have wanted to see Apple customers “locked into a single ecosystem”? Not if you believe “Thoughts On Music.” I mean, he doesn’t exactly say as much. He more or less just says it’s unreasonable for anyone to think that users could be locked into a single ecosystem. Well, I won’t paraphrase — this is what he says verbatim: Some have argued that once a consumer purchases a body of music from one of the proprietary music stores, they are forever locked into only using music players from that one company. Or, if they buy a specific player, they are locked into buying music only from that company’s music store. Is this true? Jobs then offers some compelling data, and finally arrives at the conclusion that “It’s hard to believe” this could be true. But it’s hard to believe anything, right? I keep going back to that Lyor Cohen quote from last week: My firsthand experience with Steve [Jobs] was that he was determined and was going to get only what he wanted. And he was a bully. He was very seductive, but a profound bully. And oftentimes he did not say the truth. So maybe Jobs wasn’t saying the truth in “Thoughts On Music” — not the whole truth, anyway. Or hey, give the guy the benefit of the doubt, maybe it was all true and Steve Jobs got exactly what he wanted before he died, only to have Tim Cook’s Apple upend everything immediately afterward. I dunno. It doesn’t matter. Either way, somebody is “going to get only what they want.” It just won’t be you.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Site Archive log in Kent Bush: Thanks to Clinton’s nomination, now we have to worry about Big Sister Wednesday Jul 27, 2016 at 5:00 PM Jul 27, 2016 at 5:00 PM Kent Bush More Content Now I’m so old, I read George Orwell’s “1984” in 1984. I also saw Apple’s “1984” ad where a woman dressed as like Hooters waitress smashed the screen of a huge monitor setting the masses free from boring old computers made by “Big Brother” which was a thinly veiled attack on Microsoft. Tuesday night, Hillary Clinton made history. She became the first woman to ever be nominated as a major party presidential candidate. And thanks to a strangely Orwellian big screen appearance, for the first time in American history, we have to fear Big Sister. Clinton used the breaking glass theme similar to the old Apple computer commercial in her own way. She was using the breaking glass as a representation of her candidacy breaking the glass ceiling that kept women out of the race for the presidency for so long. But the glass that broke wasn’t really a ceiling. It was the main screen so it didn’t really work symbolically. Hopefully, her graphics team can get together and remake that Apple 1984 ad again Thursday night with her acceptance speech and instead of breaking through past Presidents, she could feature Donald Trump on the screen representing Orwell’s Big Brother and use various quotes of his and then have someone break that monitor. Then she could be carried to the stage from atop the monitor by a flock of Bald Eagles while wearing Apollo Creed’s flag robe from Rocky IV while eating a hot dog. Maybe I am overthinking this. Maybe I’m not. Given the way this 2016 Presidential election has played out, would anything really surprise you? Maybe it is just a matter of the events being four years apart, but I don’t recall any national party conventions as strange as the 2016 events have been. I guess if Donald Trump’s third wife can tell you how great of a husband he is and his four children from three different women can extol him as a family man, then it makes perfect sense for Bill Clinton to tell a love story about his wife in a speech at the Democratic National Convention. “In 1971, I met a girl,” Bill Clinton said at the start of a great half-hour speech. He left out some juicy details on the way from 1971 to 2016. Maybe his memory is fading as he gets older. Bill did remember to call Hillary “the best darn change-maker I ever met in my entire life.” I’m not sure he has empirical evidence of that claim. I go to one fast food establishment where no matter how I mix it up, this one clerk gives me the correct change every time. If my total is $3.62 and I give her $4.12 she quickly throws back two quarters. If Clinton is better than that, everyone should vote for her. I had no idea how important that issue was in politics in 2016. Maybe we can do away with the domestic policy debate. Instead of questions, just give each of the candidates a $20 bill and ask how many ways we can get that back. Donald Trump would be at a significant disadvantage. He’s never seen a bill that small. If Libertarian Gary Johnson got a $20 bill, he would probably just try to buy pot with it. Anyway, isn’t “change” kind of a 2008 idea? I’m not sure that electing another Democrat who would continue the major pieces of President Barack Obama’s platform is really hard change to make. The DNC has been a far more hopeful and positive affair than last week’s Republican Convention was. I don’t know what Clinton’s acceptance speech will hold tonight, but I fully expect her to reach out to Bernie Sanders supporters, accept the accolades as the first female candidate from a major party and attack Trump with some pretty pointed barbs. It will be interesting to see where polls go after both conventions are concluded. The lull between the conventions and the first debate will be important this year as voters try to decide which unpopular candidate they are least embarrassed to support. — Kent Bush is publisher of Shawnee (Oklahoma) News-Star and can be reached at kent.bush@news-star.com.

We sure hope so!   Could Apple be working on a new iPhone, and updating iOS? We sure hope so! 03 January 2013 | News, Apple, Mobile, iPhone, Apps Author: Parcel2Go.com   There has been a lot of hype this week surrounding rumours that Apple is to launch a new iPhone, and a new iOS operating system. Is there any truth in this though? The likely answer is yes! It would be a natural step for Apple to improve on its already hugely popular smartphone and software package. These rumours began after traces of the new hardware and software began to show on app usage logs, suggesting that somebody was checking both hardware and software for compatibility issues. During usage and testing, the new iPhone 5 is identified as either “iPhone 5.1” or “5.2” on app logs. Yet, new identifiers have begun to appear on logs, in the form of “iPhone 6.1”. Combined with the iPhones incredibly short shelf life, it is highly probably that Apple is planning on releasing a new model sometime in the summer. Another major clue to the development of a new phone and operating system is the IP address that was used to carry out the testing of some apps. Low and behold, the source of the tests was Apple’s Servers based in Cupertino, California. There we have it, case closed. One thing we cannot take from developer logs is any new features of the hardware or software being tested, but given Apple’s track record, it’s likely to be much bigger, and a whole lot better than its predecessors. Rumours on the grapevine predict that we will be seeing iOS 7 later this year. What are your thoughts? Do we need another iPhone so soon, and what improvements to the software would you like to see?                             You Might Also Like... 1 Parcel2Go to Invest £300,000 Into Their Customers 21 November 2016 | Editor's Pick, Most Popular, Industry News 2 Parcel2Go Surpass Royal Mail with the UK's Cheapest 2 kg Deliveries 08 November 2016 | Editor's Pick, Most Popular, Industry News 3 What You Need to Know About myHermes Small and Medium 28 October 2016 | Editor's Pick, Most Popular, Parcel Deliveries, Industry News 4 Using eBay Analytics to Make Your Stale Listings Fresh Again 04 August 2016 | eBay, Editor's Pick, Market Place, Tips and Guides 5 Win Big with Our Olympic Competition! 02 August 2016 | Editor's Pick, Most Popular, Competitions Back to Apple Page Back to Apps Page Back to iPhone Page Back to Mobile Page Back to News Page Post your comments!

The project to grow "low-chilling variety of apples" in southern India is revolutionary, says horticulture scientist Chiranjit Parmar, with production per hectare expected to be in the range of 65 tonnes -- dramatically higher than in states like Himachal Pradesh. "If the project succeeds in the tropics, which it almost has, it will be a revolution in the apple production in India," Parmar, who is based in Mandi town of Himachal Pradesh, told IANS. He said the south Indian apple orchards -- primarily in Karnataka -- could produce 10 times more per hectare than Himachal Pradesh. This means the country's apple production will shoot up exponentially. The plantation in the south is in the nascent stage and commercial cultivation is yet to start. It started bearing fruit in less than two years, against the six-seven years it normally takes in the hills. It is estimated that over 8,000 apple trees have been planted since 2011 in and around Karnataka. Parmar, a former horticulture expert of the Solan-based Y.S. Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry, experimented with the growing of apple trees in tropical areas after seeing apple plantations in tropical Indonesia. According to him, the reason for the speedy growth of apple saplings in the tropical region is the absence of the plant's dormant phase -- a natural phenomenon which helps it resist extreme cold. "The apple plantation sees a huge success in those regions which do not experience winter at all and where the minimum temperature never falls below 12 degrees Celsius and the summer is also not harsh," he said. "Now apple plants are sent every year not only to Karnataka but also to the adjoining states," Parmar said. A majority of saplings have been supplied from the horticulture university's nursery at Bajaura in Kullu. Krishna Shetty of Mangalore is one of the growers who procured 300 saplings from Himachal Pradesh in January 2011 and planted them at 20 locations on a trial basis. Subsequently, he procured more plants in 2012. Grower Gangadhar Murthy of Tumkur, who planted apple sapplings in 2013, said his plantation was quite successful, along with coconuts. He's now eyeing a commercial cultivation of apples. "The growing conditions for apple trees are entirely different from those in their native regions. So the plants are behaving differently. For example, because of the incessant growth, flowering in the trees begins in the second year whereas it takes five to six years in the hills," Parmar said. "Moreover, the flowering is continuous throughout the year. The shoots have a tendency of growing upright. The trees are becoming tall compared to the hills. The pests and diseases in the tropics are also different and new. This can be controlled by the state research centres," he said. Parmar pointed out that some unscrupulous people have started promoting its cultivation by claiming that they have developed apple varieties exclusively suitable for southern India. "The reality is different. The variety has got no role to play in its success. It's the timings of lifting the saplings from the nursery and then their planting at the new place which governs the success," Parmar said. He said the saplings could be procured only from apple-growing belts in the hills after their dormancy is over by March. And these should be replanted in less than two days. Horticulture expert S.P. Bhardwaj, a former Joint Director at the Y.S. Parmar University, told IANS the low-chilling apple varieties should be promoted on a large scale. "The government of India should promote its cultivation as a majority of the country's apple market is being captured by the imported ones, mainly from China, the US, New Zealand and Australia," he added. The only downside, if it could be called that, is that apples grown in tropical conditions have a shorter shelf-life compared to those grown in temperate areas. Thus, apples grown in Karnataka have a time-period of 12-15 days, whereas those from the hills can last up to a month.

Tim Cook's First 5 Years At Apple Wayne Duggan , Benzinga Staff Writer     {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} August 18, 2016 12:32pm   Comments Share: Related AAPL Why Sector ETFs May Be Better Than Individual Stocks Vetr Crowd Thinks AMD Is Running Hot GameStop Up On Q3 Earnings Beat, Diversification Strategy (Investor's Business Daily) It’s hard to believe it has been nearly five years since the passing of iconic Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs. Successor Tim Cook had impossibly large shoes to fill when he first took over the CEO role on August 24, 2011. Cook took his fair share of heat during his first few months at the helm of Apple. However, Cook has now had nearly five years to show what Apple can do under his leadership. The Stock Investors gauge a CEO’s performance using one metric above all others: share price. Since Cook took over in 2011, Apple’s share price has more than doubled. Apple has gained 103.7 percent, outpacing the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY)’s 85.25 percent gain by more than 15 percent. It turns out that Cook isn't that bad of a CEO after all. Related Link: Apple, GE And Others Calling For Corporate Tax Reform Compromise Unfortunately, fair or not, Cook will always be compared to Jobs, one of the most inspiring visionaries of all time. In Jobs’ last five years as CEO, Apple’s stock skyrocketed 454.8 percent. Incredibly, that five-year period included the worst financial crisis in the U.S. since the Great Depression. In fact, the SPY actually lost 8.9 percent during that same five-year stretch. Tim Cook may not be Steve Jobs, but there will never be another Steve Jobs. The Innovation During Jobs' last five years as CEO, Apple launched the most successful product of all time: the iPhone. In addition, in that same five-year period, Apple launched the MacBook Air and the iPad. Together, those three products have generated hundreds of billions in revenue for Apple. So far the two biggest innovations under Cook’s tenure are probably the Apple Watch and Apple Pay. Apple Watch generated an estimated $6 billion in revenue in its first year, but sales were down 55 percent in Q2. While Apple’s services business, which includes Apple Music, iCloud storage and Apple Pay showed promising growth in Q2, the entire segment still accounted for only $6 billion in revenue. Think Different For a company that generated $233 billion in total revenue in 2015, Cook's projects aren't moving the needle much for Apple so far. Cook will likely never be the innovator that Steve Jobs was. Luckily for Apple investors, the numbers show Apple is still a great long-term investment under Tim Cook.

News Entertainment Love & Sex Style Mind & Body Share < br />this article: How Is The iPhone 7 Different Than The iPhone 6? The New Model Will Be Out Soon Karen Fratti @karenfratti | 8.18.16 | 12:22 pm Share < br />this article: CREDIT: Justin Sullivan /Getty Images It’s hard to believe there are only seven iterations of the iPhone because it feels so long ago since the OG release. According to overexcited watchdogs, the iPhone 7 is probably going to be released in mid-September and Apple fanatics are foaming at the mouth to get their hands on it. But how is the iPhone 7 different from the iPhone 6? Is it really worth getting all crazy over? The iPhone 7 looks a lot like the iPhone 6, but apparently will come in an extra color — the Space Black shade that Apple Watch uses. Other upgrades and tweaks are a little more hardcore. Like, apparently there is no headphone jack on the new phone. Instead, you’re going to use the Lightning headphones to listen to music on your new phone. This is sort of cool, because getting rid of the headphone jack allows Apple to make the phone completely waterproof. What sucks is that now you’re going to have to get Lightning headphones, which will really be the future. The camera on the iPhone 7 is pretty similar to that of the 6, which has a more powerful rear camera than any other generation of the phone. There is also a new home button that “responds to pressure with a vibrating sensation rather than a true physical click.” That sort of sounds like a bad vibrator product description. Abestof : Technology – Dual-lens in, Pro out in latest iPhone 7 rumor – A Best Of : … https://t.co/uemq52JOwA pic.twitter.com/z68lFT30xk — Abestof (@A_bestof) August 17, 2016 Reportedly, the storage options are changing, too. Which is amazing because I am so fucking sick of my camera stalling, even though I pay extra for more space. The cheapest storage plan is now a standard 32GB, but if you’re fucking classy, you can get up to 256GB of storage. So maybe you can have all your pics and music and other BS in one place again, finally. I really want the iPhone 7 but if they do the Bluetooth headphone thing, I'm committing — cassy. (@lovemilkovich) August 15, 2016 There are going to be other software updates, too, and the iPhone 7 will use iOS 10, which is supposed to be the best operating system yet. Then again, everything Apple does it supposed to be the best ever. So, basically, cue the the awful back and forth about whether it’s worth upgrading or not and the debates about not having a headphone jack (this Bluetooth headphones feature terrifies me). Heard a girl say "New iPhone 7 is coming soon! If you want a sneak peek take a look at your current iPhone & pretend it costs $200 more." — Lindsay Crandall (@lindscran) August 15, 2016 Then again, every Apple upgrade is awesome and sometimes stupid all at the same time. There are some tech-watchers that say it might be better to hold off for the iPhone 8, which is already in the works and will no doubt have bigger and better upgrades. Apple fans are already cranky, since the release date was supposed to be Sept. 7 but has been pushed back to Sept. 23, just in time for back to school feuds about whose phone is better. Tim Cook hasn’t even announced the launch event though. Hurry up, Apple, it’s been too long.

Tekserve is auctioning off its massive Mac museum Posted Aug 18, 2016 by Brian Heater (@bheater) 0 SHARES Next Story Twitter targets extremism, suspends an additional 235,000 terror accounts Before there were Apple Stores in Williamsburg, Grand Central Station and the World Trade Center – heck, before there were Apple Stores at all – there was Tekserve. For nearly 30 years, the Mac specialist dutifully served Manhattan, before throwing in the towel earlier this week. Now Tekserve is cleaning shop. After closing its doors on the 15th, the iconic computer retailer is selling off some of its most prized possessions, including a veritable computer history museum of largely Mac computers. The formerly in-store exhibit includes 35 pieces, featuring some real treasures like NeXTcube (from Steve Jobs’ post-, pre-Apple company), a 20th Anniversary Mac and a classic Macintosh 128K signed by Steve Wozniak: According to its auctioneers, “It was assembled carefully and documented by Tekserve co-founder Dick Demenus and his colleagues over a period of years. This curated collection consciously omits variants. Each item represents a landmark in the evolution of the Mac for both technology and aesthetics.” The collection started with an $8,000 bid and is now hovering at around $30k. The store is also auctioning off some other cool swag, including, perhaps most notably, a Blade Runner poster signed by the cast and Ridley Scott as we lament the loss of an icon like tears in rain. via Gizmodo 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Tekserve Founded 1987 Overview Tekserve is proud of our roots.

Black and white wallpapers for macOS and iOS   skip to main content skip to main menu     Apple is dropping “Store” from retail locations and online in branding simplification move By Christian Zibreg, Aug 18, 2016 Tweet 14 Comments What was once “Apple Store Fifth Avenue” is now just “Apple Fifth Avenue” as the Cupertino firm starts dropping “Store” branding from its retail locations and online. The change is live on the Apple Retail website as brick-and-mortar locations no longer have “Store” titling, as first discovered by MacRumors. That’s part of Apple’s planned simplification of Apple Store branding under the leadership of retail boss Angela Ahrendts. Recent press releases announcing Apple’s first Brooklyn store and a new World Trade Center outlet refer to these locations simply as “Apple Williamsburg” and “Apple World Trade Center,” but the change may have started rolling out with the launch of the Union Square location in San Francisco as the firm’s always referred to that store as just “Apple Union Square”. MacRumors says Apple recently sent out a memo to its retail army to let them know that the “Store” branding is gradually being dropped from both retail locations and online. “While Apple told employees the change will be gradual and will start with new stores, pages for almost all stores have been updated to remove the ‘Store’ titling,” the publication explains.

I doubt we’ll stop calling it that. Voight Hmm I like the Apple Store better Philip Lafaurie Same concept as when Facebook was starting, they called it “The Facebook”. A subtle change as removing “The” or in this case “Store” can sometimes make a difference in how we ‘feel’ about a location or a brand. In this case the word store is already implied considering you are walking into a retail location. You don’t hear Macys Store or Nordstrom Store, etc. So it just makes sense to remove the name. Agneev Mukherjee Remove “Apple Store” wholly from listings… Gregg Nonsense. Agneev Mukherjee It makes sense but only in the listings… dnice so what about the app “apple store” will it not be “Apple” ? John Smith Who cares. Stop that. Every tiny bit apple does gets major attention. Inseltraeumer It’s what Apple news websites do. Steve Harvey Dumb move. Everyone calls it the Apple Store. Let’s fire Angelena Adherts. :D I like it Marcus So now when I want to buy an Apple product I’ll have to say, “I’m going to go to the Apple?” Or “I’m going to go to Apple?” It sounds better with Store. This is dumb. Christopher Lim The latter iteration sounds fine. “I’m going to Apple to get my phone fixed” “I’m going to Apple to get a new MacBook.” It makes Apple seem closer to the customer, like you can always go to them for help. Marcus Hmm. Maybe it’s just because I always refer to it as “the Apple Store.” “Apple” in place of “Apple Store” just sounds a bit foreign to me.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines This Mac app lets you switch between recently used apps via Touch Bar A running list of great iOS and macOS apps on sale this week President-elect Trump promises tax incentives for Apple to build “Made in USA” iPhones Apple could slash prices of next year’s 4.7″ and 5.5″ iPhones with legacy LCD technology iPhone 8 to hit mass production late in the third quarter of 2017   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: ClearClockView, PullOver, & more… PullOver lets you pin an app to your screen for easier multitasking Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… EmojiSuggest brings iOS 10-like emoji suggestions to the predictive keyboard WiJoin lets you know what Wi-Fi network you’re connected to iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2016.

Apple’s latest patent shows system for taking photos underwater Patent is titled, 'Method for Color Balancing Underwater Photography' It describes new tool as an image organizer and editing application Called 'color balancing', it removes unwanted tints in underwater images This new editing tool could only be used in waterproof devices By Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.com Published: 12:27 EST, 18 August 2016 | Updated: 13:52 EST, 18 August 2016 e-mail 38 shares 36 View comments Apple's next iPhone could be waterproof - and even take pictures underwater.  The tech giant has been granted a new patent for underwater photography that would ensure more realistic-looking shots while users are submerged. It hints at the firm's first entirely waterproof gadgets that could be used underwater and dropped into water without fear.   Scroll down for videos  Filed in 2013, the patent highlights a 'color balancing' tool that would remove 'undesirable tints' of blues and greens from underwater pictures. Although Apple does not include ways to protect its handsets while the users is submerged, this does suggests that the tech giant may be working on a way  WHAT IS APPLE'S LATEST INVENTION?  Apple's latest patent could hint at waterproof phones. This application describes a 'color balancing' tool that would remove undesirable tints from underwater photography.  This tool is described as an image organizing and editing application that receives and edits image data of an underwater scene in a snapped photograph in order to remove the undesirable tints and provide objects with more realistic coloring.  The ‘computing device’ would remove the blueish or greenish tints by shifting the colors of the pixels away from a predetermine water color, which would be setup by the user. Filed in 2013, the patent highlights a 'color balancing' tool that would remove 'undesirable tints' of blues and greens from underwater pictures. Although Apple does not include ways to protect its handsets while the users is submerged, this does suggests that the tech giant may be working on a way. Apple has made several attempts to protect its devices from liquids, as the iPhone 6s was designed to be much more resistant to water damage than previous variants. In these handsets, the tech giant added waterproof material, similar to a wet suit, which covers sensitive areas and components. However, this only made the phones resistant to water, not waterproof. Apple’s recent hint towards protecting phones comes in its newly awarded patent labeled ‘Method for Color Balancing Underwater Photography’, which outlines a system for ‘color-balancing photos shot underwater’.  A pictured taken underwater typically has areas that are the same color of water, however this coloration is due to tints from specific lighting. ‘Photographing things underwater usually results in an overall tinted (often bluish or greenish tint) illumination,’ reads the patent firs spotted by Patently Apple.

Share this article Share 38 shares ‘The amount of light filtered out, and the colors of the light are filtered out depending on the depth and contents of the water (e.g. murky, salt, fresh, etc.). The document continues to explain that the objects in the shot are lit by light passing through the water, which hinders the real, vibrant colors from shining through. Apple’s recent hint towards protecting phones comes in its newly awarded patent labeled ‘Method for Color Balancing Underwater Photography’, which outlines a system for ‘color-balancing photos shot underwater’. The firm does not mention ways to waterproof phones in the document, but the technology could only be applied to waterproofed devices Apple's new tool would act as an image organizer and editing application for this process. The technology is described  as receiving and editing image data of an underwater scene in a snapped photograph, then remove the unrealistic hues. ‘In some embodiments, colors near the color of the water itself are protected to leave the water looking blue,’ explains Apple in the patent. ‘Removing undesirable tints without removing the tint of the water itself results in images with more realistic coloring of people and objects in the scene, without eliminating the color cues (e.g., blue water) that indicate that the image is a photograph of an underwater scene.’ A pictured taken underwater typically has areas that are the same color of water, however this coloration is due to tints from specific lighting. Apple's new tool would act as an image organizer and editing application for this process by receiving and editing image data The Curpentio company is calling this innovation ‘color balancing’, and it could remove the effects produced by certain light color. This would be carried out by shifting the colors of the pixels away from a predetermine water color, which would be setup by the user The Curpentio company is calling this innovation ‘color balancing’, or ‘white balancing’ that could remove ‘some or all’ the effects produced by certain light color. The ‘computing device’ would eliminate the blueish or greenish tints by shifting the colors of the pixels away from a predetermine water color, which would be setup by the user. ‘In performing color adjustments to a photograph of an underwater scene, the application of some embodiments provides a control to determine whether to fully apply this color correction to the areas that are the color of water, or reduce the color correction effects on those areas’. WHAT DOES THE INTERNET SAY ABOUT THE IPHONE7? One rumor has been debunked, which suggest there will be a single speaker instead of the dual speaker setup users had hoped for. But one thing that has stayed consistent is the dimension of both models, which were first revealed last year.  According to reports, the iPhone 7 will have a 3,100mAh battery, which is 12.5 percent bigger than the iPhone 6S Plus. But although your phone will stay powered longer, it could also mean the casing around it could be thicker.  What could be very exciting for iOS users is that Apple might be fixing the annoying ‘there is not enough available storage…’ issue with a 256GB this year. Another annoying feature that might be on Apple's to-do list is strengthening the phone’s water-resistance. This doesn't say the phone will be water-proof, but it could make a world of a difference if you drop your phone in liquid.  While many of technologies in Apple’s patents have never left the pages, this is the latest added to the pile of waterproofing technology, suggesting  the tech tycoon is determined to give its users what they have been asking for. In March 2015, the firm was awarded a separate patent for a method of making the inside of a phone waterproof rather than the outside. Called ‘Methods for shielding electronic components from moisture’, the document describes Individual components that would be covered in a thin film designed to stop liquids damaging the phone, even if it manages to penetrate the outer casing.  This coating would be applied using a method called plasma-assisted chemical vapour deposition (PACVD), which desposits thin films from gas, or vapour, states to solid states.    Read more: Apple Granted a Patent for Color Balancing Underwater Photography - Patently Apple Patent Images Share or comment on this article e-mail 38 shares Most watched News videos Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Teen films a burning 'meteorite' moving across sky in Japan Shocking moment man hits women in mass chicken shop fight Supermodel Gigi Hadid fights off man who grabs her at Milan show Mystery homeless woman in Rome avoids questions from reporter Kim Kardashian attacked in Paris by notorious prankster The moment a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Fukushima Tidal surge filmed on Sunaoshi River in Tagajo, Japan Cyclist films moment car causes him to crash then drives away 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Doorman knocks-out troublemaker during two-on-one confrontation Six rebel electors have signed an agreement to try to block...

After cutting their exposure to equities by nearly 7% in the first quarter of this year, the top 50 hedge funds added some 0.3% to their equities exposure in the second quarter. Consumer discretionary and consumer staples were the big winners in the quarter, while financials and health care stocks led the losing sectors. Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) accounted for $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, of hedge funds’ sales in the second quarter. Viking Global Investors cut its stake in Netflix by 22%, and Tiger Global sold its entire 4.2% stake (valued at $1.6 billion) in the streaming video company. The top 50 hedge funds cut their total position in Apple by 40% during the second quarter. Apple was the most sold stock in the first quarter of the year, primarily due to Carl Icahn’s sale of $4.8 billion of Apple stock. In the second quarter, sellers included Tiger Global, Greenlight Capital and Adage Capital. Inflows to the consumer discretionary sector totaled $4.2 billion in the second quarter with Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. (NYSE: HOT) receiving $2.7 billion of the total. A $2.6 billion stock purchase by Omni Capital accounted for much of the move into Starwood, which is being acquired by Marriott for $13.5 billion. The data were reported Thursday by FactSet. Second-quarter performance for holdings of the top 50 funds is a negative 1.2%, compared to a gain of 2.5% for the S&P 500 stocks. For the year to date, the indexed total return for the S&P 500 is 8.1%, compared with 5.1% for the top 50 hedge fund holdings. The most widely held stocks among the top 50 funds are Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB), which appear in the portfolios of 25 of the funds. Consumer staples’ stocks like Kroger Inc. (NYSE: KR) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) added $2.8 billion in hedge fund investments during the quarter, and CVS Health Corp. (NYSE: CVS) added $1 billion in new investment. The top 50 hedge funds purchased a total of $2.2 billion in equities in the second quarter, a massive change from the overall sale of $55 billion in U.S. equities in the first quarter. Also, according to the new report from FactSet, the top 50 hedge funds bought $1.7 billion worth of stock in small cap firms, which was significantly more than the $567 million purchased in large cap firms and the $141 million purchased in mega cap firms. More than half the first quarter’s sell-off came in equities from mega-cap (greater than $50 billion) companies and another $20 billion in first-quarter sales were attributed to large cap stocks ($10 billion to $50 billion).

There’s no way the headline is going to live up to the promise. But the draw of finding out what happens next—crossing that curiosity gap—is just too much to resist. So you take the bait. And, sure enough, you’re disappointed. Facebook wants to stop this from happening, and it’s turning to artificial intelligence to help. Earlier this month the company announced that it was tweaking its algorithms to cut down on “clickbait”—the ubiquitous plague of Internet content that over-promises and under-delivers. But it’s a big Internet out there, and plenty of other companies and sites that could benefit from tools that can separate quality news stories from fluff. Now Facebook is open sourcing software to help filter out all that Internet noise. Facebook’s AI-driven text classification system, bag-of-tricks” approach that helps machines efficiently glean information from the order in which words appear. Another FastText tactic breaks down words into “subwords“—such as prefixes, suffixes and root words—to help computers more easily learn their meanings. Beyond clickbait, Facebook suggests software developers could use FastText to help filter out spam. It could power search engines and autocomplete fields. Recommendation engines like the ones used by the likes of Amazon or Netflix could also benefit from a little artificial smarts that can get a better read on what you’re writing. FastText is just the latest of several open source AI projects to come out of Facebook in recent years. The company has released AI algorithms, a tool for spotting bugs (in code), and designs for AI-optimized hardware. And it’s not the only tech giant doing this. Google released its AI framework TensorFlow, and companies from Microsoft and Baidu to Amazon and Yahoo have all given away the code for some of their own AI tech. That may seem like an odd trend, given that each of these companies hopes to best the other with better tech, including AI. But artificial intelligence is still a budding field. The researchers creating these technologies within companies like Facebook and Google benefit from having their counterparts on the outside review their work and suggest changes. In a sense, open sourcing code offers the same potential benefit that publishing research in peer-reviewed journals does for scientists. In other words, Facebook is betting that giving away its AI tech will make for better software, because it too can benefit from the new ways others use it. And besides, more developers and researchers learning to use the software means more coders better prepared to work for Facebook in the future. Go Back to Top.

Today the company unveiled DSSTNE (pronounced “destiny”), an open source artificial intelligence framework that the company developed to power its product recommendation system. Now any company, researcher, or curious tinkerer can use it for their own AI applications. It’s the latest in series of projects recently open sourced by large tech companies all focused on a branch of AI called deep learning. Google, Facebook, and Microsoft have mainly used these systems for tasks like image and speech recognition. But given Amazon’s core business, it’s not surprising that the online retailer’s version is devoted to selling merchandise. “We are releasing DSSTNE as open source software so that the promise of deep learning can extend beyond speech and language understanding and object recognition to other areas such as search and recommendations,” the Q&A section of Amazon’s DSSTNE GitHub page reads. “We hope that researchers around the world can collaborate to improve it. But more importantly, we hope that it spurs innovation in many more areas.” Along with the idealistic rhetoric, open sourcing AI software is a way for tech industry rivals to show off and one-up each other. When Google released its TensorFlow framework last year, it didn’t offer support for running the software across multiple servers at the same time. That meant users couldn’t speed up their AI computations by stringing together clusters of computers the same way Google could running a more advanced version of the system internally. That created an opening for other software companies like Microsoft and Yahoo to release their own open source deep learning frameworks that support distributed computing clusters. Google has since caught up, releasing a version of TensorFlow that supports clusters earlier this year. Amazon claims its system takes distribution one step further by enabling users to to spread a deep learning problem not just across multiple servers, but across multiple processors within each server. Amazon also says DSSTNE is designed to work with sparser data sets than TensorFlow and other deep learning frameworks. Google uses TensorFlow internally for tasks such as image recognition, where it can rely on the Internet’s vast store of, say, cat photos to train its AI to recognize images of cats. Amazon’s scenarios are quite different. The company does sells millions of different products. But the number of examples of how the purchase of one product relates to the purchase of another are relatively few by comparison to cats on the Internet. To make compelling recommendations—that is, to recommend products that customers are more likely to click on and buy—Amazon has a strong incentive to create a system that can make good predictions based on less data. By open sourcing DSSTNE, Amazon is increasing the likelihood that some smart person somewhere outside the company will help the company think of ways to make the system better. Go Back to Top.

Last year Google opened TensorFlow to the entire world. This meant that any individual, company, or organization could build their own AI applications using the same software that Google does to fuel  everything from photo recognition to automated email replies. But there was a catch. While Google stretches its platform across thousands of computer servers, the version it released to the public could run only on a single machine. This made TensorFlow considerably less capable for others. Google is trying to fix that deficiency now. Today the company is releasing a new version of TensorFlow, and the most notable new feature is the ability to run it on multiple machines at the same time. Not everyone needs to run TensorFlow on hundreds, let alone thousands, of servers. But many researchers and startups could will benefit from being able to run TensorFlow on multiple machines. TensorFlow technical lead Rajat Monga explains that the delay in releasing a multi-server version of TensorFlow was due to the difficulties of adapting the software to be usable outside of Google’s highly customized data centers. “Our software stack is differently internally from what people externally use,” he says. “It would have been extremely difficult to just take that and make it open source.” The TensorFlow team opted to release a more limited version last year just to get something into researchers’ hands while continuing to work on more advanced features. TensorFlow Unleashed TensorFlow is based on a branch of AI called deep learning, which draws inspiration from the way that human brain cells communicate with each other. Deep learning has become central to the machine learning efforts of other tech giants such as Facebook, Microsoft, and Yahoo, all of which are busy releasing their own AI projects into the wild. Early last year Facebook released some of the tools it uses to run the open source AI framework Torch across multiple servers. This year Microsoft open sourced its own AI framework that can run on multiple servers, and Yahoo quickly followed suit. Despite the available alternatives, TensorFlow is already surprisingly popular. It was among the six open source projects that received the most attention from developers in all of 2015, even though it was only released in November. But it’s only now that TensorFlow has been unshackled from the one-machine limit that we’ll start to really see what it’s capable of. Go Back to Top.

Getty Images Ever wished you could order Taco Bell for everyone in the office using a simple chat bot? No? Well, you’ll soon be able to it anyway. Taco Bell has blessed the world with TacoBot, a chatbot for the popular workplace chat app Slack. Tell TacoBot what you want, and it keeps a running tally of your order, just like that screen at the drive-thru. When you’re done, pay through TacoBot and pick up your order at the Nearest Participating Taco Bell. If that sounds like it would be handy for your team—or, you know, your “team”—you can join the waiting list. Be warned, though—it might be a few months before you revel in the miracle of this advance in productivity tech, says Martin Legowiecki. He’s the creative technology director at Deutsch, the agency that built TacoBot. And even after you’re in, you’ll still have to send someone with the Taco Bell app on their phone to fetch the order. So, much like the Tacocopter before it, the real bot-ified future of meat, cheese, and tortilla still hasn’t arrived. But fear not: Legowiecki says delivery is something Taco Bell is working on, too. Really Slacking TacoBot is one of the most gluttonous manifestations yet of the bot-powered future of work that many companies predict. In China, people already use the popular instant message app WeChat for all sorts of daily tasks, from checking their bank balances to ordering cabs to buying sneakers. Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are betting that chatbots will replace apps here in the US, too. Slack, with competitors like Hipchat, hope this chat revolution won’t just change consumer behavior but the way work gets done at corporations with lots of money to spend on office supplies, company lunches, and whatever else big companies spend their budgets on. Slack is taking this so seriously that last year it said that it would invest $80 million in companies that build Slack bots. That vision of the future aside, TacoBot came about almost by accident. Deutsch was contracted by Taco Bell to redesign the company’s website, Legowiecki says. During the course of that project, the Taco Bell and Deutsch teams worked together using Slack. “They fell in love with it, we fell in love with it,” Legowiecki says. “So we though wouldn’t it be great to make Taco Bell available through Slack?” The Deutsch team built TacoBot using Wit.ai, an online service for building software that’s able understand and respond to human language. (Facebook bought Wit.ai last year to help build its virtual assistant M.) Legowiecki says this means it will be able to bring TacoBot to other apps in the future, such as Hipchat, Facebook Messenger, Amazon Echo, even Apple TV. In other words, food bots are coming, whether you want them or not. As if you need another excuse to hit the drive-thru. Go Back to Top.

Black Friday 2016 TV Deals Frequent Flier Miles Are Kaput—The Game's About Credit Cards Now 3 Facebook is now using artificial intelligence to automatically generate captions for photos in the News Feed of people who can’t see them. The tool is called Automatic Alternative Text, and it dovetails with text-to-speech engines that allow blind people to use Facebook in other ways. Using deep neural networks, the system can identify particular objects in a photo, from cars and boats to ice cream and pizza. It can pick out particular characteristics of the people in the photo, including smiles and beards and eyeglasses. And it can analyze a photo in a more general sense, determining that a photo depicts sun or ocean waves or snow. The text-to speech engine will then “read” these things aloud. Matt King. Facebook A Facebook employee named Matt King showed me a prototype of the service last fall. King, 49, is blind, and though he acknowledged that the service was far from perfect, he said it was a notable improvement over the the status quo. He wasn’t wrong. King showed the system a photo of a friend and his bike as he traveled through Europe. Facebook’s AI described the scene as outdoors. It said the photo included grass and trees and clouds, and that the scene was near water. If the photo had turned up in his News Feed in the past, King would have known only that his friend had posted a photo. “My dream is that it would also tell me that it includes Christoph with his bike,” King told me. “But from my perspective as a blind user, going from essentially zero percent satisfaction from a photo to somewhere in the neighborhood of half … is a huge jump.” As King told me, the system doesn’t always get things right. And it hasn’t yet reached a point where it generates captions in full and complete sentences. But this will come. Others have already used deep neural nets to do much the same thing. As King pointed out, a service that only gets part of the way there is still important now—Facebook says that more than 50,000 people already are using the service with text-to-speech engines.

Now, right on cue, Apple has acquired Emotient, a startup that uses artificial intelligence to analyze your facial expressions and read your emotions. First reported by The Wall Street Journal, the deal is notable because, well, it’s Apple, the world’s most valuable company and one of the most powerful tech giants. It’s unclear how Apple intends to use the company, but as Moore indicates, the tech built by Emotient is part of much larger trend across the industry. Using what are called deep neural networks—vast networks of hardware and software that approximate the web of neurons in the human brain—companies like Google and Facebook are working on similar face recognition technology and have already rolled it into their online services. ‘There are huge implications in terms of making dialogue with computers much more meaningful.’ “We have very real data points showing computers doing a better job than humans in accessing emotional states,” Moore said in December. “There are huge implications in terms of making dialogue with computers much more meaningful.” Moore points our that such technology can be used for everything from security to accessing mental heath. As the Journal explains, Emotient sold its tech to advertisers, letting them analyze how consumers responded to their ads. According to the startup, doctors have also used the technology to determine patient pain, and retailers have used it to track how shoppers react to products in stores. With deep neural nets, machines can learn to do certain tasks by analyzing large amounts of data. If you feed enough photos of someone smiling into a neural net, for instance, it can learn to understand when someone is happy. And these techniques can be applied to more than just images. They have also proved successful with speech recognition and, to a certain extent, natural language understanding. Google and Facebook and Microsoft are at the forefront of this deep learning movement. But Apple been pushing in the same direction. In the fall, Apple acquired a startup called VocalIQ, which uses deep neural nets for speech recognition. You might not be able to hide your true feelings from Siri for much longer. Go Back to Top.

Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 12.11.15. 12.11.15 Time of Publication: 7:09 pm. 7:09 pm Elon Musk Snags Top Google Researcher for New AI Non-Profit Tesla founder Elon Musk, big-name venture capitalist Peter Thiel, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and several other notable tech names have launched a new artificial intelligence startup called OpenAI, assembling a particularly impressive array of AI talent that includes a top researcher from Google. But the idea, ostensibly, isn’t to make money. Overseen by ex-Googler Ilya Sutskever and Greg Brockman, the former CTO of high-profile payments startup Stripe, OpenAI has the talent to compete with the industry’s top artificial intelligence outfits, including Google and Facebook—but the company has been setup as a non-profit. “Our goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return,” Brockman said in a blog post. The apparent aim is to build systems based on deep learning, a form of artificial intelligence that has proven extremely adept in recent years at identifying images, recognizing spoken words, translating from one language to another, and, to a certain extent, understanding the natural way that we humans talk. Sutskever is a protege of Geoff Hinton, one of the founding fathers of the deep learning movement, who now works for Google. Deep learning relies on what are called neural networks, vast networks of machines that approximate the networks of neurons in the human brain. Feed enough photos of a cat into a neural net, and it can learn to identify a cat. Feed enough dialogue into a neural net, and it can learn to carry on a pretty good, if sometimes dodgy, conversation. The hope is that top researchers can take this much further. Some believe the method can even be used to mimic human common sense. Currently, companies like Google and Facebook and Microsoft sit at the forefront of this movement. But OpenAI aims push the state of the art forward without worrying about financial gain. Instead, they intend to open source their work, freely sharing it with the world at large. Recently, Google open sourced the core software engine, TensorFlow, that drives its deep learning services, and just this week, Facebook open sourced its deep learning hardware. They too are looking to advance the technology through widespread collaboration. But you have to wonder if they made these moves because they knew OpenAI was on the way. OpenAI certainly has the pedigree to make some serious headway in the field. Musk and Thiel are co-chairs of the company. Other backers include Alan Kay, one of the founding fathers of the PC, and Yoshua Bengio, another top deep learning researcher. Altogether, OpenAI says, its backers have committed $1 billion to the project. Sometimes you have to spend money, even if you don’t plan on making any. Go Back to Top.

All it took was supplying millions of examples so that the company’s software—based on a branch of artificial intelligence called deep learning—could start recognizing the difference between cats and other furry creatures. But Jeremy Howard wants to use deep learning for something a little more practical: diagnosing illnesses. And he’s finally getting his chance. Today Howard’s company, Enlitic, said it was going to start working with Capitol Health Limited, a radiology clinic with locations across Australia, to have its software look at X-rays. Enlitic won’t replace radiologists. Instead, the software is designed to help them do their jobs more quickly and make fewer mistakes. First, it checks each file submitted to make sure the image matches what the technicians say it’s supposed to be—for example, it makes sure that if an image is tagged as a left knee that it’s not actually a right knee. Then, it looks for anomalies in the image. Depending on what it finds, it assigns a priority to the X-ray and routes it to a radiologist. For example, if it finds nodules on an image of a pair of lungs, it will assign it a high-priority status and route it to a pulmonary radiologist. If it detects what appears to be an aneurysm, it will route the X-ray to a cardiovascular radiologist instead. If it finds no anomalies, it will mark it as low priority. After a radiologist has reviewed the image, the software will help write the paperwork by auto-generating text for some of the more tedious parts of a report. More Deep Learning Intel Is Building Artificial Smarts Right Into Its Chips Facebook’s AI Can Caption Photos for the Blind on Its Own Artificial Intelligence Is Now Telling Doctors How to Treat You Enlitic’s X-ray algorithms are just the latest example of deep learning being put to practical use. Facebook is now using deep learning techniques to caption photos for the blind. Yelp recently explained how it’s using deep learning to optimize what photos it shows on restaurant listings. And similar techniques are also part of what powers Microsoft’s Skype Translate. And Enlitic isn’t the only company trying to apply artificial intelligence to medicine. IBM’s Watson has been used for research at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and more recently to provide diet and exercise advice. The app Bright.md aims to help physicians speed up routine appointments. But Enlitic’s deal appears to be one of the biggest real-world tests of deep learning’s ability to aid medical diagnostics. Eventually, Howard hopes the technology will help expand access to medical diagnostics as Capital Health begins opening clinics in Asia. He cites World Economic Forum report that forecasts a severe shortage of medical experts in the developing world if training programs aren’t accelerated. With any luck, artificial intelligence can shoulder some of that burden. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Through acquisitions of companies like Indisys, Xtremeinsights, and perhaps most importantly, fellow chip maker Altera (a $16.7 billion deal), Intel has devoted much its artificial intelligence efforts on baking AI into its into chips, as well as software that powers its 3-D video cameras. Today, Intel has added yet more AI to its portfolio with the purchase of Saffron Technology. Like many other AI startups, Saffron attempts to extract useful information from huge datasets via algorithms inspired in part on the way the human brain works. But instead of focusing on deep learning, the trendy branch of AI in which Google and Facebook are heavily investing, Saffron is focused its own technique called associative memory. The company was founded in 1999 by former IBM Knowledge Management and Intelligent Agent Center chief scientist Manuel Aparicio and led by former PeopleSoft executive Gayle Sheppard. It has deep roots in the enterprise software industry and cut its teeth selling software to the Department of Defense, such as a system for predicting the likely location of roadside bombs in Iraq. “We see an opportunity to apply cognitive computing not only to high-powered servers crunching enterprise data, but also to new consumer devices that need to see, sense, and interpret complex information in real time,” Intel New Technology Group Senior Vice President Josh Walden says. “Big data can happen on small devices, as long as they’re smart enough and connected.” Go Back to Top.

Anton Mueller, executive editor at Bloomsbury, acquired world English rights to Eat the Apple from Chris Clemans at The Clegg Agency. Eat the Apple is the memoir of Young, a marine who was deployed to Iraq and re-deployed twice again. It begins the day he enlisted at the age of 18 after drunkenly crashing his car into a fire hydrant. It uses "a kaleidoscopic array of immersive narrative angles" to tell the story of his three hard tours in Iraq during the surge and IED (improvised explosive device) road wars, "dropping the reader unarmed into the heart of Marine Corps culture and laying bare the tragicomic absurdism of war in the 21st century, the manned-up vulnerability of those on the front lines, and the true if often misguided motivations that drove a young man to a life in the military". Mueller said: “Deft in its emotional, psychological and intellectual complexity, Eat the Apple is a powerful testament to war’s tragic futility and an indictment of our current foreign engagement. It is brilliantly, daringly written. The energy on the page is a thing of beauty. There are passages here you will want to dwell on. They are poetry. Throughout, Matt Young also uses shifts in point of view that split the narrative consciousness in ways that enable a stunning richness of experience, loads of humor, and a kind of alienated pathos that makes us really care for him.” Clemans said: “From the opening pages I knew I was in the presence of a thrilling and original voice. Matt is omnivorous in his approach, taking always the narrative tack that will get him and the reader closest to the truth, something that Elliot Ackerman more eloquently dubs his ‘stylistic and structural swagger.’ In Eat the Apple, he writes with fearless candor and irreverence about the backstage culture of war, the collective grunt soul, and the private flaws and delusions that led him to become one of the few and the proud.” Eat the Apple will be published globally in 2017 in hardcover and e-book across all Bloomsbury territories. rights Bloomsbury Anton Mueller Chris Clemans Matt Young Share Share on Facebook Tweet this on Twitter Share on Google Plus Share on Linkedin View the discussion thread.

While the rise of software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications has certainly made it easier to employ Apple Macintosh systems in place of a Windows PC, most organizations are still heavily dependent on Windows applications. Because of that requirement, large numbers of Macintoshes in the enterprise wind up being configured with desktop virtualization software that enables them to run Windows applications. Aiming to make working across both desktop environments more fluid, Parallels today released Parallels Desktop 12 for Mac, which Parallels says is now 25 percent faster. In addition, Parallels has developed a set of utilities designed to make it simpler to, for example, create a screenshot by clicking on a single icon. Finally, Parallels has announced that it is providing end users with access to up to 500GB of free online storage via an alliance with Acronis. Nikolay Dobrovolskiy, vice president of desktop virtualization for Parallels, says that Parallels Desktop 12 for Mac is compatible with both existing Macintosh operating systems and the Sierra upgrade that is due out this fall. For the moment, Dobrovolskiy says, it’s clear that while Sierra will bring forward new features that make it simpler to employ multiple Apple devices, Apple is still working on polishing the upgrade. “Sierra still consumes a lot of CPU cycles,” says Dobrovolskiy. In the meantime, there are well over 30,000 Windows applications that most users of Apple Macintosh systems in the enterprise still need to be able to access. Given the time, money and effort needed to replace all those applications, it’s unlikely that most of those systems won’t need some form of desktop virtualization software for many years to come.

The annual conference and expo by Apple runs through January 18. (Photo : David Paul Morris/Getty Images) It's time to say goodbye to 3.5 millimeter headphone jack as Intel is serious in pushing through the USB Type-C to replace the old audio jack. However, it seems like Apple will not yet to the trend and continues to use the proprietary lightning connector to their new iPhone models instead of the USB Type-C port. Apple preferred lightning connector over USB-C for iPhones Apple has completely ditches the idea of USB-C port for iPhones and preferred lightning connector instead. Though it's worth mentioning that Apple adopted the said port for their 12-inch MacBook laptop, this time the tech giant utilized the proprietary connector according to Mac Rumors. Apple is already known for utilizing its own connectors between 2003 and 2012 for iPhone, iPod and iPad. The most noteworthy was the MagSafe connector used in laptops models beyond the 12-inch MacBook. Intel pushes for USB-C Port Intel is pushing USB-C Port as replacement for the traditional 3.5 millimeter audio jack. According to Apple Insider, Intel is impressed with the features of the port include better sound, power management and thinness.  The chip-maker company dubbed USB-C as the best option for accessory makers. USB-C Port vs Lightning Connector First and foremost, the obvious reason why Apple chose lightning over USB-C port is it proprietary and they have full control of it. To be able to know the advantage and disadvantage of the two ports with each other, a comparison of the two was made by Dave Haynie a forum commenter of the website Quora. According to Haynie, USB-C port scored high when it comes to durability due to its ability to handle more signals than lightning connector. Another advantage of USB-C is its visibility in the years to come. Being the new standard port soon, people can always replace an old cable when damaged than replacing the phone when the lightning connector wears off.  Tags USB C vs Lightning, USB Type-C, Apple Lightning Connector, apple latest news, MacBoo Pro released date, iPhone 7 Release Date, USB-C Port © 2016 University Herald, All rights reserved.

That might sound like bad news for anyone with a collection of expensive headphones or accessories – but according to Intel, it's actually an upgrade. By Aaron Brown Aaron Brown PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 10:15, Fri, Aug 19, 2016 GETTY • EXPRESS NEWSPAPERSA number of upcoming smartphones will ditch the traditional 3.5mm headphone port Apple is expected to drop the industry-standard 3.5mm headphone port from its next smartphone, with whispers the US firm would ditch the hundred-year old technology starting back in November 2015. A swathe of leaked images and video around the device seem to have all-but confirmed that your current headphones will not work with the iPhone 7 – unless you use this awful adapter. Within days of the first rumours breaking that Apple was considering dropping the headphone socket, some 300,000 people signed an online petition against the move. And Apple is not the only one, a number of upcoming Android smartphones are reportedly looking at ditching the traditional headphone port. Lenovo's Moto Z and Moto Z Force have already dropped the 3.5mm port in favour of USB Type-C headphones (or a cumbersome USB-C to 3.5mm headphone adapter). But Intel architects Brad Saunders and Rahman Ismail have told Cnet about a new USB audio standard headed to a future iteration of USB Type-C that might change your mind about the death of the 3.5mm port. YOUTUBE • TINHTE.VNA new Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter was leaked earlier this month First – the 3.5mm jack and the accompanying circuitry takes up valuable space inside increasingly svelte smartphones. If audio output is handled by the same port used to sync and charge the device – it frees up space for other things, like a larger speaker. But that's not the only advantage. The traditional 3.5mm port is an analog connector, meaning it can transfer sound – but that's about it. INTEL Intel architects have discussed the advantages of using USB-C for audio, when it ships this year By comparison, USB Type-C is able to deliver preprocessed sound – allowing the phone to deliver noise cancellation or virtual surround sound, even on regular headphones. Unlike the industry-standard 3.5mm port, USB Type-C can control how much power it sends. That means a battery-saving mode on the smartphone could disable power to the microphone on your headphones to help eke out a few more minutes battery life. It can also be used to charge headphones while they are in use. MOTOROLALenovo's latest smartphones, including the Moto Z Force, have dropped the 3.5mm jack MOTOROLAAudio output, syncing and charging are all handled through the single USB Type-C port Apple has hinted at plans to bring noise-cancelling and fitness tracking abilities to its EarPod headphones – without adding any bulk – since the smarts and power is provided via the Lightning port. The Cupertino company was first granted a patent for Lightning connector equipped headphones back in December 2014. Another patent shows Lightning headphones with built-in pressure sensors. These sensors would dynamically change the volume of your music playback based on ambient noise and the seal between the headphone and your ear canal.

Play slideshow 1 of 13 The iPhone SE near a normal iPhone 6S The US patent is a follow-up to a similar idea filed by the company back in 2011, it would track the air pressure inside your ear and adjust the volume at different audible frequencies to compensate for the seal. Of course, there are drawbacks to using a Lightning connector or USB Type-C port to handle audio output. You will no longer be able to charge your smartphone and listen to music via a wired connection at the same time – without a special dongle. And you'll also need a dongle to connect any headphones from your existing collection with the new device. But hopefully the advantages included with this new connector will be worth the potentially-painful tradeoffs. Intel says the specification for the new standard is likely to arrive this quarter.

Today, Cook still calls Jobs irreplaceable. "To me, Steve's not replaceable — by anyone," Cook told Jena McGregor of The Washington Post in a recent interview. "He was an original of a species." Jobs, who was obsessed with product details and marketing, has been credited with transforming Apple and changing several industries, including technology, retail and entertainment. He was also a driven and sometimes ruthless manager. Ousted from his own company in 1985, Jobs maintained an aggressive management style when he returned to Apple a decade later to help turn things around. He arguably had to be an aggressive leader — after all, Apple was on the verge of bankruptcy and a major underdog at the time. As one former Apple employee put it: "Steve was a wartime CEO." His style, while controversial, worked. Apple went from underdog status to the most valuable company in the world. Jobs may be one of a kind, but Cook — who was named CEO in August 2011, six weeks before Jobs died — is the one taking up the mantle. He also takes a less conventional approach to the role. Cook doesn't want to be a "traditional CEO," he told McGregor: "I think of a traditional CEO as being divorced from customers. … I also think that the traditional CEO believes his or her job is the profit and loss, is the revenue statement, the income and expense, the balance sheet." While the numbers are important, they're not all that is important, he explained. "There's an incredible responsibility to the employees of the company, to the communities and the countries that the company operates in, to people who assemble its products, to developers, to the whole ecosystem of the company," Cook said. "And so I have a maybe nontraditional view there. I get criticized for it some, I recognize. If you care about long-term shareholder return, all of these other things are really critical."

Responding to an inquiry about NFC support, a company representative has confirmed that as of tomorrow, August 19, Apple Pay and Android Pay will be available for payment both in-restaurant and in the Drive Thru. With Apple Pay support, Chick-fil-A customers will simply bring their iPhone or Apple Watch to the card reader to pay for their meal. Earlier, the all-things-chicken restaurant chain experimented with promotional offerings in the form of QR codes via its iPhone and iPad app. They prioritized Apple Pay after rival KFC began supporting Apple’s mobile payment service in early-June. Earlier today, Apple Pay added support for 37 banks and credit unions in the United States.

Apple unveiled the new iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 tablets and the iMac with 5K Retina display. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)  ( Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) ) The latest rumors about the upcoming iMac 2016 hinted that it might sport an enhanced AMD processor along with its graphics processor. Apple is reportedly planning to include many new features in their desktops like VR compatibility, True Tone display, and much more. Advertisement Apple World reported that the tech company might ditch the Intel chipsets in order to include the latest AMD's Zen processor along with their Polaris graphics card. Reports claimed that the Zen processor consists of eight cores and 16 threads, which will provide a boosted performance. The Polaris graphics card 10 and 11 are expected to provide an amazing VR experience to users while playing high-resolution games. "What you'll see us do is completely different with Polaris 10 and 11," said Raja Koduri, who is Radeon Technologies Group Chief Architect, reported Mac World. "We are really focusing on trying to bring FinFET technology with its amazing performance per watt to as many segments as possible. As many ranges of performance as possible, you'll be pleased with what we're going to do with this thing and you'll be surprised." Advertisement Earlier, there were rumors that the new iMac 2016 will consist of the Intel's Kaby Lake processor. However, certain reports suggested that as the company will not be able to produce the chipsets in bulk on time, Apple might go with the AMD processors. However, there is no official confirmation as of now. Furthermore, the iMac 2016 is expected to consist of similar design like that of its predecessor with flash drive option. As far as the display specs are concerned, the iMac 2016 is rumored to sport the True Tone display, which will automatically adjust the white balance and thus provide the users with more natural watching experience. Meanwhile, there are reports that the iMac 2016 is expected to be launched in October 2016. However, Apple has provided no confirmation on the same yet. In terms of price, the upcoming Apple desktop might be priced higher because of the new AMD Zen processor.

Looks like Apple may skip the iPhone 7 Pro this year InvestorPlace 8/18/2016 Brad Moon One of the more intriguing rumors about Apple's coming iPhone 7 launch was the iPhone 7 Pro, but it now appears to be dead. According to Japanese blog Macotakara, Apple has backed away from any plan to release a premium-priced 5.5-inch smartphone, instead sticking with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus for 2016. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 110.84 -0.96 -0.86% How Did the iPhone 7 Pro Rumors Get Started? Two factors have combined to drive the prediction that Apple was at least considering a premium version of its biggest smartphone — the iPhone 7 Pro. The first was the appearance of two distinctly different 5.5-inch smartphone shells shown off in leaked photos. While superficially identical, one sported the typical round camera lens bump found on the iPhone 6 Plus. However, the second has a much wider cutout to accommodate the dual-camera system that is widely expected to make an appearance in Apple’s 2016 iPhone lineup. It also has what appear to be Smart Connector ports. The second was AAPL’s strategy of releasing “pro” versions of its products to designate a more capable — and more expensive — version. First there was the MacBook Pro and the Mac Pro. Then last year, in an effort to appeal to professional users and combat sliding iPad revenue, Apple introduced the more expensive iPad Pro. Back to School 2016: The 5 Best Laptops for Students With iPhone sales also facing downward pressure and the challenge of convincing consumers to buy into an incremental upgrade, the idea of releasing a premium-priced iPhone 7 Pro made sense. The two distinctly different iPhone 7 Plus shell photos fueled speculation that Apple had chosen this approach. The standard iPhone 7 Plus would be the expected incremental refresh, as part of Apple’s new three-year release cycle. It would get the usual upgrades of a faster CPU and tweaked camera and sell for the same $749. However, the iPhone 7 Pro would incorporate the new dual-lens camera system that is expected to offer vastly improved photo capabilities. Smart Connector ports mean it could also plug into accessories like the Smart Keyboard offered for the iPad Pro. And for those big upgrades, consumers would be expected to pay a premium. Is the iPhone 7 Pro Really Dead? Macotakara, citing “reliable information sources,” says Apple plans to release the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus this year. No iPhone 7 Pro in the lineup. This is just one Mac rumor site, but Macotakara has a pretty good track record of calling these things, including getting the early scoop on the names of the iPhone 5c and iPhone SE. Obviously, we won’t know who’s right until September when AAPL finally reveals the new iPhones. It’s entirely possible the photos showing the iPhone 7 Pro are fake, and it’s also possible they’re prototypes. It’s also possible Apple has been hedging its bets, developing multiple iterations of the same basic phone — the latest spy shots of the iPhone 7 Plus show the bigger camera cutout, but no Smart Connector. There’s a high degree of certainty that Apple will be introducing a powerful, dual-lens camera in September. The question is whether that camera shows up in the iPhone 7 Plus, or a new iPhone 7 Pro. For now at least, the smart money is on the iPhone 7 Plus, with plans for an iPhone Pro shelved, at least for 2016. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

In Q2 2015, the Korean manufacturer shipped 72 million devices, with a 21.8 per cent market share. This year, it increased its share to 22.3 per cent, driven by sales of the Galaxy S7, and furthering its lead over rival Apple. The iPhone-maker saw sales fall in Q2, from 48 million in 2015 to 44.4 million. It holds second spot in Gartner’s top five with a shrinking share of 12.9 per cent. Huawei makes up the top three with a share of 8.9 per cent (8pc in 2015), having sold more than 30 million devices in Q2. It’s Chinese rivals Oppo and Xiaomi made up the top five, with a 5.4 per cent and 4.5 per cent market share respectively. Oppo, which owns OnePlus, more than doubled shipments for the quarter yearly, from just over eight million in 2015 to 18.4 million. Xiaomi shipments remained flat at 15.5 million. Overall, 344 million smartphones were shipped in the three months ending June 30, up from 330 million in the same period last year. But the overall mobile market shrank slightly (0.5 per cent), due to the diminishing feature phone market, with sales down 14 per cent. “Demand for premium smartphones slowed in the second quarter of 2016 as consumers wait for new hardware launches in the second half of the year,” said Gartner research directo Anshul Gupta. “The top five smartphone manufacturers together continued to gain market share in the second quarter of 2016 — up from 51.5 per cent to 54 per cent year on year, led by Oppo, Samsung and Huawei. “Features such as an anti-shake camera optimised for selfies, and rapid charge technology, helped Oppo carve a niche market for itself and boost sales in a highly competitive and commoditised smartphone market.” Android domination Google’s operating system Android strengthened its dominance, seeing market share increase from 82.2 per cent in Q2 2015 to 86.2 per cent. Overall, 296 million Android devices shipped in the quarter. It gained share from Apple’s operating system iOS, which had a 12.9 per cent share, down from 14.6 per cent YOY. Windows Phone sales also slumped, with just 1.9 million devices running the operating system shipped in Q2, down from 8.2 million, giving it just a 0.6 per cent market share. BlackBerry’s OS also slumped to just a 0.1 per cent market share, with just 400,000 devices shipped running the operating system in Q2. BlackBerry last year launched its first Android device, and recently announced a follow-up, the DTEK50. “Google is evolving the Android platform fast, which allows Android players to remain at the cutting edge of smartphone technology,” said Gartner research directo Roberta Cozza. “Facing a highly commoditised smartphone market, Google’s focus is to further expand and diversify the Android platform with additional functionalities, like virtual reality, enabling more-intelligent experiences and reach into wearables, connected home devices, in-car entertainment and TV.” TAGS Android Apple BlackBerry Gartner Huawei iOS Microsoft Mobile News OnePlus OPPO Samsung Windows Xiaomi SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleVodafone UK extends CSL IoT deal by 10 years Next articleGfK: Brexit had "no immediate impact" on UK smartphone sales James Pearce http://www.mobilenewscwp.co.uk RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Industry mixed over government 5G investment EE CEO Marc Allera calls for operators to be clearer on coverage Vodafone becomes latest Doro 6520 stockist 2 COMMENTS Aaron August 18, 2016 at 1:33 pm You mentioned that Blackberry’s market share dropped in regards to the BB10 OS, but what about their total market share when you add in their Android devices? Any chance you’re able to combine them to give a “real” market share in the future instead of just showing the BB10 OS market share? Reply Michael Garwood August 23, 2016 at 3:07 pm Unfortunately, BlackBerry sales for Android are so low right now, their figure isn’t available. Based on that, the ‘real’ market share figure, combining the two, would make little difference to its positioning. Sales of the Priv have been very poor and the DTEK would not have been listed at the time of the figures being shown to us.

That’s according to Hendi Susanto, a research analyst at Gabelli & Co, who issued advice to investors after conversations with OLED maker Universal Display. Hendi thinks that although OLED is coming to Apple smartphones, we may see “partial adoption”, i.e. only the iPhone 8 Plus (should it exist) will get the feature. Here’s the quote in question, as published by Barrons: “Speculation regarding the potential adoption of OLED displays by Apple continues to dominate major discussions with investors. The current speculation anticipates Apple’s adopted of OLED displays in its iPhone in 2017 or 2018. We believe that Apple can adopt OLED displays sooner rather than later by pursuing a partial adoption and incorporating it in a specialised edition of a new iPhone version." Samsung's Galaxy S7 already features an OLED display OLED displays already exist in the wild, and are commonplace on flagship smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy range. Unlike conventional displays, OLED screens feature pixels that produce their own light, which means a backlight isn't necessary – that saves some space. This also means that you can leave pixels off to produce black, which means (1) you get truer blacks, and (2) you save battery life. Unfortunately, Apple has yet to adopt this already popular technology. The iPhone 8 is expected to usher in significant changes to Apple smartphone design, in contrast to the supposedly iterative iPhone 7 design we’re likely to see revealed this September. The iPhone 8, which is due to arrive in September 2017, will mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and has been mooted to debut a new all-glass chassis design.

Tim Cook.jpg Apple CEO Tim Cook (File) Print Email Guest Voices By Guest Voices AL.com on August 18, 2016 at 7:45 AM comments Matthew Brown  By Matthew Brown, District 1 State Board of Education member Apple CEO, Tim Cook, was born in Mobile and graduated from Robertsdale High School. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in industrial engineering from Auburn University and a Master of Business Administration from Duke. Tim Cook is not a computer scientist. He is not a computer programmer. Tim Cook is not even an electrical engineer. Yet Tim Cook has proven to be one of the most capable CEOs in the tech industry by adeptly leading the world's most valuable company following the passing of Steve Jobs. Tim Cook's leadership has been so phenomenal that Apple is one of the Retirement Systems of Alabama's top investments. Despite Tim Cook's astounding success, some Alabamians apparently think that he is not qualified to serve as Apple's CEO. Why? Because Tim Cook lacks experience as a computer programmer. I draw this conclusion based on the stream of criticisms flowing from Alabama's education community following the recent selection of Michael Sentance (who lacks experience as a public school teacher) as the new CEO of Alabama's public education system. Though State Superintendent of Education is the technical title for the position, the term CEO might be better suited. The State Superintendent of Education provides general administrative oversight for Alabama's $6.6 billion public education system. The system employs 91,000 superintendents, principals, teachers, and support staff and is charged with the education of over 730,000 students. In light of the position's executive nature, is it reasonable to disqualify someone from serving as the State Superintendent of Education simply because they do not have K-12 teaching experience? The fact that Tim Cook has successfully led Apple without experience as a computer programmer should not come as a surprise. Many CEOs have little or no direct experience working in their company's core non-managerial fields. The CEO of the Infirmary Health hospital system in south Alabama never practiced medicine. The CEO of Alabama's largest private sector employer, Alabama Power, is a lawyer, not an electrical engineer or journeyman lineman. The CEO of Thompson Engineering, one of south Alabama's largest civil engineering firms, is an accountant, not a civil engineer. Very few mayors have experience as municipal employees. Many administrators at colleges and universities do not come from the ranks of professors. In 2012, the American Council of Education estimated that twenty percent of U.S. college presidents came from fields outside academia, a ratio that was trending upward at that time. Some local Alabama public school systems have hired superintendents who have no public school teaching experience. The belief that only a teacher is capable of successfully leading Alabama's public education system is flawed because it assumes that only a teacher can understand the needs of educators. A state superintendent must be familiar with the education policies and practices that have worked in other states and must be able to evaluate whether those reforms would benefit a state like Alabama. The state superintendent must be a leader who can implement carefully planned, evidence-based policy reforms with support from educators and public officials. It is difficult to imagine someone who is more qualified than Michael Sentance to serve as Alabama's State Superintendent of Education. Sentance held the equivalent position in Massachusetts, a state with one of the top education programs in the country. He served as a regional coordinator for the U.S. Department of Education during the Bush administration. Sentance has visited hundreds of schools in hundreds of school districts in states all over the country. He has likewise visited numerous classrooms and spoken with teachers from poor school systems and wealthy school systems, in rural areas and urban areas, and in states with diverse political climates. No candidate for the state superintendent position came to the table with a better understanding of what works and does not work in different education systems. No candidate was more qualified for the position than Michael Sentance. As the only Board member who voted exclusively for Michael Sentance, my vote was a vote to say that Alabama's children and Alabama's teachers deserve a public education system that works. Michael Sentance is the leader who can guide the way to making Alabama's public education system competitive around the country and around the world. Columnists John Archibald Kyle Whitmire Roy S.

By David Gilbert August 18, 2016 14:28 BST Close Embed Feed Where did it all go wrong for Xiaomi? IBTimes UK <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/20092" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> It was just four days after Christmas 2014, and for Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi, the presents kept on coming as it announced a funding round of $1.1bn (£850m) at a valuation of $45bn. Just 18 months on from Xiaomi's last funding round, new analysis of its business suggests it is worth less than $4bn. So what happened to the world's once most valuable start-up? Among those investing was Yuri Milner, a serial investor who predicted Xiaomi's valuation could more than double to $100bn. "In every conceivable benchmark, it's almost unprecedented in terms of its speed of growth," Milner told Bloomberg at the time. And Milner should know about these things. His investment in Facebook in 2009 when it was valued at $10bn helped him become a billionaire when the social media giant went public in 2012. He was also an investor in Chinese online ecommerce giant Alibaba in 2011, three years before it went public. But even someone with a track record like Milner's can get it wrong. In that period, Xiaomi has seen its share of the smartphone market decline dramatically while its ecosystem of connected devices – which now includes rice cookers, VR headsets and even umbrellas – has failed to generate any significant revenue for the company. Xiaomi, once hailed as the world's most valuable start-up, has lost $40bn from its valuation in just 18 months. Where did it all go wrong?Reuters According to figures released this week by research firm IDC, Xiaomi saw sales of its smartphones drop by almost 40% in China during the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015. The overall Chinese market grew during the same period by 4.6% and while Apple suffered a similarly large drop in sales, Xiaomi's real competitors in the mid-to-low end of the market – Huawei, Oppo and Vivo – all saw significant growth. In the 12 months following its record-breaking valuation, Xiaomi missed smartphone sales targets — twice — as well as revenue targets. According to analyst Richard Windsor revenues could drop a further 10-20% in 2016 to give Xiaomi a valuation of just $3.6bn. So where did it all go wrong for the company once dubbed the 'Apple of the East'? Lei Jun, founder and chief executive officer of Xiaomi feels the heatReuters Where it all went wrong for Xiaomi Xiaomi's meteoric rise was based on one simple fact: It was able to produce smartphones with premium hardware and features which cost a fraction of those on sale from Apple or Samsung. However that advantage rapidly ebbed away when multiple manufacturers followed suit and produced their own smartphones which offered premium specs at low prices. However, unlike Xiaomi, its competitors were able to offer something new and innovative. Vivo offered curved screens; Oppo and OnePlus dangled rapid charging; LeEco offered exclusive content; and Huawei threw in dual lens cameras and fingerprint sensors. "I think Xiaomi's current performance and growth in the smartphone space has stalled, as competitors with better R&D, vertical manufacturing expertise, and a wider distribution and geographic footprint has surpassed the brand," Neil Shah, analyst with CounterPoint Research told IBTimes UK. "Xiaomi's inability to innovate independently is one of the key reasons." Another issue for Xiaomi is its continued focus on the ultra-budget end of the market with products like its RedMi series, despite clear evidence that Chinese customers were willing to pay more for their smartphones. Its decision to delay the release of the more advanced Mi Note 2 smartphone in favour of the budget Redmi Note 3, which it launched earlier this year, suggests the company has its priorities confused and has failed to spot a change in market conditions. The Xiaomi Redmi 3MIUI forum Global expansion pipedreams Back in December 2014, one of the reasons Milner was so confident about Xiaomi's potential to double in value was the fact that it only sold smartphones in a handful of Asian countries. The calculation was that once Xiaomi launched its smartphones in western Europe and the United States, it would become a global player. However, the problem is that Xiaomi simply does not have the patent portfolio to enter these markets. Long accused of copying hardware and features of established players like Apple and Samsung, Xiaomi is completely unprepared to enter a more mature market, where it would immediately face a volley of patent lawsuits, stymieing any chance it has of establishing itself as a major player. Even in India, its second-biggest market, it has faced sales bans for infringing Ericsson's patents. And despite signing patent licensing deals with Microsoft and Qualcomm, it is still unprepared to make the leap into these bigger markets. As well as the huge potential for growth, investors cited the company's fanatical customer base in China as a major advantage, with Xiaomi consistently hailing the fact that its users were among the most deeply engaged and – according to the company – willing to buy into an ecosystem of Xiaomi products, which had the company's smartphones at its heart. Lack of loyalty The problem with this analysis however is that customers – particularly Chinese customers – are very savvy and have little or no brand loyalty. According to a 2014 study by research firm Bain & Company, brands in China are constantly having to win new customers due to this lack of loyalty, and while Xiaomi might have once been able to convince these new customers with their offerings, that is clearly no longer the case. Xiaomi has always called itself an "internet company" rather than a smartphone company, and in the last couple of years it has made investments in a wide range of hardware start-ups creating connected products, part of what it calls its Mi Ecosystem. "Even though smartphones have always been the lead product for Xiaomi, the company has always suggested that it sees its future more broadly, as essentially an e-commerce company for a whole variety of products," Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research told IBTimes UK. This sounds like a smart move at a time when the global smartphone market is expected to see annual sales growth slow to just 3.1% in 2016. The problem so far, is that Xiaomi has been unable to make any of these investments pay off. "Xiaomi is in deep s**t" Xiaomi is a private company and so it does not make its finances public but data from CounterPoint Research suggests that up to 85% of the company's revenue comes from smartphones, while another major source of revenue comes from its software and services division. This means that investments in the likes of Ninebot, the Chinese company that bought Segway, have yet to pay off – and it is unclear if they ever will. The Ninebot Mini is Xiaomi 's take on the growing 'hoverboard' market, but will it really take off?Xiaomi As Steve Millward wrote on the Tech in Asia blog, "Xiaomi is in deep s**t", and it is difficult to see a way back. "I don't see much of a recovery coming for Xiaomi in the future," Dawson concludes. Shah suggests the company's plans are muddled. "Xiaomi's future right now is volatile and the strategy feels all over the place as it pivots from a 'content, apps and services' driven ecosystem with the smartphone at the centre, to a hardware-based 'connected everything ecosystem'." This all suggests that rather than being known as the 'Apple of the East', Xiaomi may soon be known as the 'Blackberry of the East'.

By Sarmistha Acharya August 18, 2016 13:56 BST Apple to open its first R&D center in ChinaReuters Apple is planning to open its first research and development centre in China later this year, the company said. Chief executive officer Tim Cook revealed the plans about increasing investment in R&D in the country after a meeting with China's vice premier Zhang Gaoli. The latest move comes just after it reported revenue drop in third quarter in China; a market where Apple faces stiff competition from the local vendors such as Huawei and Oppo. In its third quarter earnings Apple reported a 33% year-on-year drop in revenue in China. The company generated $8.9bn (£6.8bn) revenue in Q3 in China. The figure was $13bn in the same quarter last year. The R&D centre will have both new and existing staff. Apple already has 9,000 staff in the country. Apple has 45 corporate offices in China, reports Financial Times. "The centre will open later this year, bringing together our engineering and operations teams in China as we develop advanced technologies and services for our products, both for our customers in China and around the world," the company said. Apple is investing more in future products. It reported a 26% increase in its quarterly R&D spending to $2.6bn. Apple's annual R&D is now $10bn. Apple has invested $1bn in Chinese car-hailing service Didi Chuxing this year. China is a key market for Apple. But earlier this year Apple's iTunes and iBooks services were blocked in China. The company lost a patent case in Beijing when the Intellectual Property Office ruled that iPhone 6 and 6s models have identical design as Shenzhen Baili's 100C phone.

Further out, Apple’s rumored electric vehicle effort — Project Titan — could also trigger the kind of massive revenue windfall necessary to drive Apple’s valuation above $1 trillion. To be clear, Apple is certainly a plausible candidate here, but it needs at least one new home-run product to surpass this historic mark. The difficulty, argued Motley Fool, is that it is operating in a sector currently seeing few prospects for the scale of growth needed to hit the magic $1T number. Amazon, in contrast, has already demonstrated the kind of growth trajectory required to get there, argues Andrew Tonner. Researcher eMarketer estimates that by 2018, global retail sales will surpass $28 trillion dollars, but e-commerce will represent only 5.5% of those sales. Through programs like AWS or its rumored global logistics service, Amazon continually finds ways to lower its cost basis. This virtuous cycle – known as its Flywheel strategy – enables Amazon to compete for ever-greater pieces of e-commerce market share. This enduring trait should help allow Amazon to continue to consolidate e-commerce market share for the better part of the next generation. I see few reasons Amazon cannot or will not become the online Wal-Mart to the world, even as Wal-Mart itself finally gets its act together to challenge Amazon. Amazon has historically chased market growth at all costs, sacrificing profit to do so, so I can see the argument here – and that trend-line is somewhat persuasive. But with Amazon having a current market cap of $362B against Apple’s $588B, and the huge potential revenues that could be accrued from a future car project, I’m skeptical. Alphabet – parent company of Google – is also pitched as a third candidate, with a current valuation of $536B. What’s your view?

Intel has tried their hand at trying to get in on the market, but it’s safe to say that they haven’t really had much success, at least not on the same level that they have had with their computer chips, but all of that could change soon. Intel has always offered its foundry services to help build chips for their customers, but only if they are based on Intel’s own architecture. However that has changed recently when Intel announced that they will now be building chips based on the ARM architecture which is used by the likes of Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, and so on, and based on this, it has been suggested by analysts that Intel could very well provide chips for Apple’s iOS devices in the future. According to Counterpoint Research director Neil Shah, “Apple likes diversification in case there is a supply issue. Apple can also use it as leverage to bargain Intel chip pricing for its Macs and so forth.” Right now TSMC is making Apple’s A-series chipsets, such as the A10 for this year’s iPhone, although we have also heard that they will be working on the A11 for 2017, so if and when Intel does get around to manufacturing the chipsets for Apple, it won’t be anytime soon. However the report from Fortune notes that because ARM has licensed limited capabilities to Intel, highly customized chipsets like the A-series from Apple might not be one of them. In any case take it with a grain of salt for now, but who knows what the future holds? Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about Intel, iPhone and SoC.

All eyes are looking to San Francisco and Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). This annual event hosts the gathering of Apple’s developer community from all corners of the globe to learn about the biggest news on all things Apple.  It is highly anticipated that iPhone 7 will be unveiled at this mega event. This event will also showcase the new Apple Watches, MacBook and a second version of the iPad Pro.  Rumors of iPhone 7 features, specs, and release date have been buzzing around for months now.  Sources remain consistent about the iPhone 7’s better battery life, better camera, and new pressure sensitive home button.  Even the name “iPhone 7” is up for debate.  We may not see the iPhone 7 at this WWDC, but instead be introduced to the all-new “iPhone 6se”.  This makes sense because it keeps it follows the path of the iPhone SE model that debuted in the in March of 2016. iOS 10 will certainly be release the new iPhone which will really enhance the iPhone experience. The iPhone 7, or whatever name Apple choses to call it, will feature a seamless integration between Siri and a new category of apps and features. Notifications, interactive messages, and expanded voice-command for Siri are just a few of the enhancements that Apple’s newest cell phone provide.  Image Source: Photo source: Apple Developer The line grows as the wait continues.

(Google via AP) 0 By Aditya Madanapalle /  18 Aug 2016 , 16:12 Emoji are smileys that originated in Japanese mobile phones in the early 90s. They were adopted by Apple and then by Android. Emoji have found their way into the Unicode character set, which is a set of specifications widely used in applications, the world wide web and operating systems. The purpose of Unicode is to allow people around the world to use computers in their native languages. New characters are put on a road map, and included in timely updates to the Unicode standard. The proliferation of an increasing number of emoji can push back accessibility in regional, dead or obscure languages. This hampers the timely use of these languages with computers by people speaking in local, regional languages as well as researchers and students working with esoteric languages. Apple’s Emoji Pack for Women. Image Credits: Apple Earlier this month, Apple launched a new emoji pact aimed at promoting gender equality. In June this year, Facebook added emoji packs for Messenger that celebrated diversity by giving people more gender and skin colour options to express themselves in. Google proposed the inclusion of female gender emoji to the Unicode consortium in May this year. The idea was to better represent professional women. The question is, does emoji really need to get more diverse? Here is a standard set of emoji. They are all gender neutral, and can be used by anyone for self expression. Black, white, male, female, it is just an emoticon in the end. Adding colours and genders actually introduces racial and gender differences in a character set that has none. There is no reason why emoji for professions or activities should not follow the same, neutral format. Moreover, adding gender specific emoji can alienate transgender and genderqueer people, and support gender stereotypes in the specific implementation. Here is a letter to the Unicode consortium on the proposed gender update, from a respondent known only as E. The proposed gender distinctions follow outdated gender stereotypes, and they render trans and genderqueer people invisible. PREGNANT WOMAN needs more gender options because people with very different genders (and gendered looks) have the ability to get pregnant. Trans and intersex men as well as genderqueer people might all be able to. They are not represented by a pregnant woman emoji. BRIDE WITH VEIL is cliché, anyone getting married could wear a veil. It needs more gender options. MAN IN TUXEDO and MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT LEVITATING also need more gender options, why would only men wear these types of clothes? Women and genderqueer people can and do wear these and are not represented. Facebook’s “more diverse” emoji. Image: AP Gendered emoji just introduces more complications, more characters, more stereotypes and at the same time, alienates all of those who are not represented by these “diverse” emoji. A global standard, especially one that is future looking is better off not implementing gendered emoji. Instead of implementing emoji for three or more genders in five or more skin shades to represent diversity, it is better to implement each expression in a neutral gender and colour, as it has historically been represented.

Intel has long offered foundry services in which they manufacture chips designed by customers, but that service has so far been limited to chips based on its own architecture. As of this week, however, the company has announced that it will also be able to produce ARM-based chips. This would allow Intel to compete with TSMC and Samsung for Apple’s iPhone and iPad chip business … Apple licenses ARM architecture to design its own A-series chips for iPhones and iPads. It has historically commissioned TSMC and Samsung to make these chips, though increasingly moving away from Samsung: TSMC is reported to be the only manufacturer of processors for the iPhone 7, and perhaps also for the iPhone 8. Intel coming on board as an ARM chipmaker creates two very good reasons for Apple to consider it as a future supplier. First, Apple generally likes to have a diverse supply-chain, to avoid becoming dependent on a single supplier. Second, commissioning both Mac and iOS device chips from Intel would give Apple additional bargaining power for both product lines. “Apple likes diversification in case there is a supply issue,” Counterpoint Research director Neil Shah says, noting that Tim Cook is known as a supply chain guru. “Apple can also use it as leverage to bargain Intel chip pricing for its Macs and so forth.” Other analysts agree that Intel will be targeting Apple’s A-series chip business, though noting that it would have to work hard on pricing to be competitive – Apple is renowned for driving hard bargains with suppliers. “We believe these updates were modest positives and estimate the key customer win that could really move the needle would be a foundry win at Apple,” UBS analyst Stephen Chin wrote on Wednesday. “Another uncertainty is how aggressive could Intel be with its foundry pricing to win new customers.” Fortune notes that there are other question-marks also. ARM has licensed limited capabilities to Intel, so highly-customized designs such as Apple’s may not be included. Also, Intel expects to start making 10 nm scale chips next year, but it has already had scheduling setbacks and its latest high-end PC chip family, known as Kaby Lake, is being made at the older 14 nm scale. Given the lead-times involved in such contracts, it is not expected that Intel would be in a position to produce A-series chips any earlier than 2019. In the meantime, it’s been reported that there will be one Intel chip inside the iPhone 7: the LTE modem.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus Rumors, Updates and Release Date: Pro Out, Dual-Camera Lenses In! By Krixia Zhienelle Subingsubing Aug 17, 2016 | 11:08 PM Rumors have run the mill about the new iPhone 7, which is set to launch on September 17. However, contrary to initial reports, it looks like devoted Apple watchers are only going to get two iterations of the Apple device this fall: the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus; meaning, there's no iPhone Pro for the time being. There were supposed to be three phones for the launch; iPhone Pro was going to set itself apart from the two other phones, the standard iPhone 7 and the single-lens system iPhone 7 Plus, with its dual-camera lens system. According to latest reports, however, it's the iPhone 7 Plus that's getting the camera hardware update; so, there might be no need for a third reengineered phone. Why dual-camera lenses are great Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Apple users who are also photography enthusiasts should definitely watch out for this camera upgrade. A dual-camera lens system means that there are essentially two cameras to take two different photos with different color or light settings. Then, they combine together to form a sharper, more vivid image. Of course, it's not an Apple-pioneering technology. LG G5 has a 16-megapixel camera alongside an 8-megapixel wide-angle lens to take better landscape photos. The Huawei P9, on the other hand, has one colored and one monochrome camera combining together to form one solid image. Basically, we're looking at better zoom features, optimum image stabilization, and a camera system able to work well under low-light conditions. This is definitely a surefire hit for potential upgraders; no doubt Apple hitched its wagon on the dual-lens train. The Live Photos feature on the iPhone 6 and 6s was great, but there isn't much utility there. Other rumors afloat Apart from the new iPhone Pro report, not much has changed from what we already know so far. It looks like the iPhone 7 is still losing its 3.5mm headphone jack in favor of Bluetooth technology. The design is likely to look the same as the iPhone 6 and 6s, although the iPhone 7 will offer two different screen sizes: a 4.7" and a 5.5" display. Moreover, we're still getting that pressure-sensitive home button, which means less risk of your capacitive button breaking down. With the slew of rumors still coming, it looks like the mill is still running around and keeping fans on their toes for the new iPhones. Sounds like great news for Apple, too!
