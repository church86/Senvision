From phones to laptops to cases, if it’s coming from Apple, it will be expensive. The iconic brand, however, now seems to be reforming its image by offering products that come at a budget, case in point the recently launched iPad that is the cheapest the company has ever offered. Apple users now also have the option of budget smartphones that include the iPhone SE which the company has just updated to offer more storage. While this may be the beginning of Apple’s new brand image, it is a good time to look back on some of the expensive products that the Cupertino giant has ever offered. Apple LISA $9,995 PHOTO: AFP LISA was the first mouse-operated desktop computer to have a graphical user interface system with a 5MB hard drive. However, the revolutionary product cost a massive $9,999 in 1985 which would translate to over $24,000 in today’s terms. The exceptionally high price coupled with a relatively low performance and unreliability forced Apple to phase out the product. Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh $7,499 PHOTO: YOUTUBE First released in 1997, the Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh or TAM was a truly unique piece of technology that held all its components in a slim body behind the screen. Considered as a prehistoric ancestor of the modern-day iMac, the computer was significantly more expensive than any other product Apple was offering at the time, coming in at $7,500, which would be about $11,200 today. However, in a little less than a year, the price got slashed to $1,995 to clear stocks. When the TAM was finally sold out, it was discontinued. Macintosh Portable $7,300 PHOTO: AFP This was Apple’s first portable computer that went on for sale in 1989. Exceptionally heavy by today’s standards, the computer weighed in at around 16lbs, though it didn’t feature external cords which meant users could possibly carry it with them. Apple’s Macintosh Portable cost $7,300 which would be about $14,300 in today’s terms. Apple LaserWriter $6,995 PHOTO: MUSEUM VICTORIA Apple’s expensive LaserWriter printer was launched in 1985 and mainly targeted businesses of the time by allowing over a dozen Macintosh users to share the device. The LaserWriter was also one of the very first laser printers available on the mass-market and helped usher in the desktop publishing revolution. However, the steep price of $6,995 – $16,000 by today’s standards – made it very expensive for individual users. Apple Watch Edition $17,000 PHOTO: APPLE Apple entered the smart wearable market in 2015 with the release of the Apple Watch that cost a modest $349 for the baseline model. However, what’s more interesting is that the device came in a collector’s version called Apple Watch Edition, which was made in 18-karat yellow or rose gold casing and could cost as high as $17,000. The devise, however, was not able to gain traction among users and as such was trimmed down to a fitness device in the newer version that topped out at $1,300 rather than a style piece. Mac Pro $20,934.45 PHOTO: APPLE This souped up Mac Pro may be the most useful expensive Apple product on the list. With even the most advanced internal specs that the Cuppertino giant can offer, the Mac barely crosses the $20,000 mark and offers a computer capable of handling even the most strenuous tasks.

For the less geeky, iOS 10.3 brings faster animations, places higher priority on account security and might free up slightly more space on your device. A 31-year old file system is laid to rest Let’s talk about the file system first. Apple has been using the aging HFS (Hierarchical File System) file system (now HFS+) on its Macs and iDevices (an Apple device running iOS) for over 30 years now. It’s an ancient file system that was designed for the era of floppy disks and hard drives. Support for modern SSDs and Apple’s “fusion drives” was only tacked on as needed. Image: Apple APFS is optimised for flash storage and focuses on encryption. We won’t bore you with details, but just know that APFS is designed to be faster, safer and more robust than the previous one. It also supports ‘Space Sharing’, a feature that allows logical volumes to resize on the fly. In other words, free space is better utilised by allocating it to the user or your OS as needed. For an iDevice user, these changes will go unnoticed. The more advanced features of APFS, including faster cloning, snapshots and crash protection, will be more prominent on macOS devices. Sadly, macOS doesn’t get the official update just yet, though you can enable an experimental version in macOS Sierra using the diskutil command in Terminal. Account security The other major update is much more noticeable and deals with how your Apple ID is presented. Apple ID settings are placed prominently at the top of the Settings menu and give you full access to your Apple ID -related settings, including your personal information, account security, payment methods, iCloud management and even connected devices and so on. It even shows if connected devices have Find My Device features enabled and gives you the option to remotely disconnect a device from your Apple ID. Apple has been asking users to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) since the last couple of updates at least, but now, if you don’t enable it, you’ll get a notification in the Settings menu when you boot into iOS 10.3 for the first time. The notification will remain until you explicitly decline to enable 2FA or enable 2FA. 2FA will require a secondary authentication when you sign in with your Apple ID on any service or device. This can take the form of an SMS sent to your registered mobile number or even a code that’s thrown up on a connected Apple device. Siri gets smarter A number of updates to Siri have been introduced in 10.3, but most of these pertain to Apple Car Play and Home Kit support, both of which are a rarity in India. Notably, however, Siri can now follow cricket and give you scores and stats for the Indian Premiere League and International Cricket Council. Siri also gets improved support for ride-sharing apps and can now schedule rides for you. Faster animations, noisy AirPods, and more The animations in iOS 10.3 are supposed to be slightly faster than they were in iOS 10.2.1. This will make your iDevice feel that little bit snappier, even if the update doesn’t actually make your device faster. Apple is also looking to drop support for 32-bit applications in future updates to iOS. Developers have been warned to update their apps of course, but now, iOS 10.3 will show you apps the soon-to-be-incompatible apps on your device. This is good as you can look for replacements to your favourite, 32-bit apps or pester the developer to update. A feature first seen in the beta version of iOS 10.3 is also here now. Find My AirPods will now tell you the last known location of your easy-to-lose AirPods. Note that this is the last place your AirPods connected to an iDevice rather than their last known location. The AirPods do not have in-built GPS. To further improve your chances of finding the AirPods, Find My AirPods can be used to get your AirPods to play a loud noise. Apple’s official release notes for iOS 10.3 are as follows: iOS 10.3 iOS 10.3 introduces new features including the ability to locate AirPods using Find my iPhone and more ways to use Siri with payment, ride booking and automaker apps. Find My iPhone View the current or last known location of your AirPods Play a sound on one or both AirPods to help you find them Siri Support for paying and checking status of bills with payment apps Support for scheduling with ride booking apps Support for checking car fuel level, lock status, turning on lights and activating horn with automaker apps Cricket sports scores and statistics for Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council CarPlay Shortcuts in the status bar for easy access to last used apps Apple Music Now Playing screen gives access to Up Next and the currently playing song’s album Daily curated playlists and new music categories in Apple Music Other improvements and fixes Rent once and watch your iTunes movies across your devices New Settings unified view for your Apple ID account information, settings and devices Hourly weather in Maps using 3D Touch on the displayed current temperature Support for searching “parked car” in Maps Calendar adds the ability to delete an unwanted invite and report it as junk Home app support to trigger scenes using accessories with switches and buttons Home app support for accessory battery level status Podcasts support for 3D Touch and Today widget to access recently updated shows Podcast shows or episodes are shareable to Messages with full playback support Fixes an issue that could prevent Maps from displaying your current location after resetting Location & Privacy VoiceOver stability improvements for Phone, Safari and Mail Details of the security updates in iOS 10.3 are available here.

It's always high stakes for the companies, but perhaps more than ever, the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S8 on Wednesday, and the anniversary edition of the iPhone later this year, could be the most important smartphone launches ever for both companies. That's because it comes at a time when the smartphone market is saturating and after both companies have gone through testing periods. The Galaxy S8, which has been extensively leaked, will be released following the Note 7 scandal last year, in which Samsung was forced to recall and eventually discontinued the handset after several caught fire. The South Korean giant apologized and released a full report on what went wrong in January, but the episode is still fresh in consumers' minds. At the same time, Samsung Group's heir-apparent Jay Y. Lee was charged by prosecutors with bribery and embezzlement connected to South Korea's ongoing corruption scandal which led to the impeachment of the country's President Park Geun-hye. A successful and innovative Galaxy S8 smartphone will be key to shifting attention away from Samsung's current issues, putting the Note 7 saga to bed, and boosting sales and profit in its mobile division. show chapters What did Samsung unveil?    Friday, 24 Mar 2017 | 8:39 AM ET | 02:28 Meanwhile, Apple has also had a tough time recently. In its fiscal 2016 results, the U.S. technology giant experienced the first annual revenue decline since 2001, after iPhone sales fell for three consecutive quarters. Many have questioned Apple's chief executive Tim Cook's ability to innovate pointing to the Apple Watch as the only new product category under his leadership. While talk of driverless cars and augmented reality (AR) – a technology Cook has said could be as big as the smartphone itself - have yet to materialize in any products. The iPhone 7, Apple's last flagship got criticized for not being a big change from the iPhone 6s. But from recent leaks, the Galaxy S8 and the iPhone anniversary addition, potentially called the iPhone 8, may just be the best devices both companies have ever produced. Samsung's flagship will have a big screen and new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, while Apple's smartphone is rumored to have a new 3-D camera and AR capabilities. Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that the next iPhone will create a "supercycle" for Apple. Driving a new wave of users to buy the next flagship devices will also be crucial if Apple and Samsung want their customers to adopt technologies and services that they are staking their future on such as AI and virtual reality. But competition is tough and Huawei is chasing both Apple and Samsung with the Chinese firm establishing itself as the number three smartphone player in the world. With such high-expectations and both companies keen to put recent issues in the past, Samsung and Apple need to deliver with their flagship launches, which can't be like any other.

According to earlier claims, the tenth anniversary iPhone will be unveiled in September and come only as a limited release during the first month. However, it looks like Apple is going full throttle with the manufacturing process of the next iPhone. According to Digitimes, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is now at the next phase of production for the Apple A11 chip. Starting April, TSMC will start mass producing the said ARM processors that will later power the iPhone 8. The report also mentioned that Apple’s main chip supplier is targeting a full production run of 50 million units by the end of July. Furthermore, it also set a target of 100 million A11 chips by the end of 2017. iPhone 8 concept (via iphone8update.com) The A11 chip, is Apple’s next generation ARM processor for the iPhone 8. It will be manufactured under the same processing node other 10nm FinFET processors such as the Mediatek Helio and HiSilicon Kirin. Unfortunately, not a lot of details are known about the next A11 chip from Apple. So far, the current A10 Fusion chip is built with a total of four cores per die. As for the A11, Apple has been mum even on the core count of the said processor. However, there is a big chance that it will be an eight-core system due to the fact that its counterparts are now using the said number of cores. Even though the chip is now being produced, experts still believe that the iPhone 8 will be released in September on limited availability. This is mainly because a lot of new technology has been put in the new phone. Apart from the new processor, it will also include an OLED display and a plethora of new features. These features, according to analysts, are what will drive the iPhone 8’s price to more than $1,000. For more updates on the iPhone 8, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

X Luxembourg to support Irish appeal over Apple tax ruling Other states subjected to EU investigation may join case over alleged illegal state aid about 16 hours ago Joe Brennan Apple and the Government argue that because the iPhone and iPad maker’s products and services are created, designed and engineered in the US, the bulk of the profits of the units are due on the other side of the Atlantic. Photograph: Lucy Nicholson         A number of European Union countries are understood to be considering joining forces with Ireland as it prepares to fight the European Commission’s finding last year that the State gave Apple €13 billion in illegal tax aid. Luxembourg, whose tax treatment of multinationals including McDonalds and Amazon has also been targeted by EU competition authorities in recent times, plans to make a so-called intervention in support of the Government in its case against the commission, a spokesman for the Grand Duchy’s finance ministry has told The Irish Times. He declined to say what aspects of Ireland’s appeal to Europe’s General Court that Luxembourg will be weighing in on. Observers expect other countries to become involved in the biggest-ever EU state aid case, including member states that have been subject to investigation into alleged sweetheart deals with major corporations. However, a spokesman for the finance ministry in the Netherlands, where the commission ruled in 2016 that Starbucks had received up to €30 million of illegal tax benefits, said his country does not plan to make a representation in Ireland’s Apple appeal. Representatives from the finance ministry in France, which has also been in the commission’s sights in recent years, didn’t respond to a request for comment. Michael Noonan attacks EU body over corporate tax plans Thirteen billion reasons ‘not enough’ to accept EU’s Apple tax ruling Getting to the core of Europe’s case against Apple and Ireland Interest in outcome EU law “allows an EU member state, an EU institution or any person who can prove an interest in the outcome of a case to apply to intervene in a proceedings before the General Court”, said Marco Hickey, head of the EU competition and regulated markets team at law firm LK Shields in Dublin. “The intervener submits a statement in intervention, supporting or opposing the claims of one of the parties, to which the parties may then respond.” The Government and Apple filed separate appeals last year against the commission’s decision that the Revenue Commissioners afforded Apple an unfair advantage in two “rulings”, in 1991 and 2007, by allowing the group channel most of the income from European sales through “head office” divisions of two Apple subsidiaries in Ireland, which were non-resident for tax purposes. ADVERTISEMENT However, Apple and the Government argue that because the iPhone and iPad maker’s products and services are created, designed and engineered in the US, the bulk of the profits of the units are due on the other side of the Atlantic. It will take upwards of two years for the appeals before the General Court in Luxembourg are completed. The outcome will almost certainly be appealed before Europe’s top court, the EU Court of Justice. Separate appeals Mr Hickey said while the State and Apple have filed separate appeals, the General Court may decide to join both cases “for the purposes of the written or oral procedure or of the final judgment”. A spokesman for the Department of Finance said: “All member states have legal standing to intervene in proceedings that go before the European courts. It is our intention that the best possible case for Ireland is presented to the court on all matters relating to the Apple state aid decision.” Meanwhile, although an initial deadline was set for the start of the year for Ireland to collect the back taxes, plus interest, from Apple, the spokesman said that “the commission have confirmed that they are satisfied with Ireland’s progress on the issue to date” and that it is “not uncommon for member states to require more time for recovery”. The department will hold the money in an escrow account pending the outcome of all appeals. The collection process has been complicated by the fact that Revenue must align the EU’s formula with Irish tax law in calculating exactly how much is owed, while agreement is also needed on how the money is managed while it is held in escrow.       Topics: Department of Finance Eu European Commission European Union Apple Read More If Apple won’t pay tax what hope is there for civilisation?

The 1.1 update also lets you use Siri to control your Apple TV viewing, but not from the iPad’s regular home screen — instead, you can use voice commands by holding a microphone button on the app’s UI to search for, select, pause, and play your media. It’s taken quite a while for the company to bring Apple TV Remote capabilities to iPad. Apple SVP Eddy Cue originally teased the software back in 2015, saying it would be arriving in early 2016. In reality, it didn’t hit the iPhone until last August, where it served as a more advanced and feature-rich version of the physical remote that shipped with Apple TV boxes. They’re useful for regular viewers, who won’t now have to fumble for tiny remotes, but both iPhone and iPad variants of the app still don’t let you watch Apple TV while on the move.

Vishal Mathur With iOS 10.3, Apple is finally switching to a new file format known as Apple File System. Apple is now rolling out the iOS 10.3 update for iPhone, iPad and the iPod Touch. The latest operating system (OS) brings a bunch of new features as well as performance enhancements, and would most likely be the last big iOS 10 update. There is the redesigned iCloud option, which now shows your Apple ID information as well as the storage details in one place. The CarPlay experience has also been improved, with interface redesigns and additional information screens in different apps that make control easier. Virtual assistant Siri can now pull out cricket scores and stats from International Cricket Council (ICC) tournaments as well as annual the Indian Premier League (IPL) extravaganza. Apple has also added a notification in case you open an app that runs the older 32-bit architecture, suggesting that this app will not work with future versions of iOS—it is believed that the iOS 11 software will completely drop support for 32-bit apps, and developers have been getting warnings from Apple about this, as far back as 2015. There is also a new Podcasts widget, updates to SiriKit, 3D Touch actions for Maps and widened support for HomeKit. However, we haven’t even talked about the most critical bit yet—security. Click here for enlarge Also Read | Review: Apple iPhone 7 Plus With iOS 10.3, Apple is finally switching to a new file format known as Apple File System (APFS). This replaces the HFS+ file system that has been in use since 1998, on computers and subsequently phones (it was an evolution of the HFS standard that was introduced in 1985). When you install iOS 10.3 on your iPhone or iPad, for example, it will automatically convert the storage filesystem from HFS+ to APFS. The advantages of APFS include optimized storage (which means critical space may get freed up on the same device) and faster read and write speeds (which will improve overall performance) on solid state and flash drives. However, the biggest change is the security aspect. APFS provides full disk encryption as well as encryption for individual files and folders—with the option of no encryption, single-key encryption and multi-key encryption. APFS will not change how you see your documents, folders and files. Visually, and structurally, things will remain the same as they were earlier, since all the changes are happening behind the scenes. The APFS system has been designed to run on iOS, macOS, tvOS and WatchOS, and we should see specific updates for the other three platforms sometime in the near future. Apple documentation suggests that no data will be deleted or lost during this conversion process—however, just to be on the safe side, we would recommend a complete backup of the iPhone or iPad, before installing the update.

Earlier this month, Zac outlined a few of the problems a data connection could solve, while we’ve also noted of a few of the technical hurdles involved in implementing the feature. Would you pay more for an LTE-equipped Apple Watch in the form of a hardware or carrier premium? Take the poll below: Take Our Poll Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Earlier today, an analyst claimed that Apple’s supply chain was ripe with indication that suppliers were ready to produce an LTE Apple Watch. In an effort to solve some of the battery concerns related to such a feature, the analyst claimed that Apple was testing a lower-power LTE chip that would drain minimal power while offering cellular connectivity and VOIP support. Today’s report isn’t the first we’ve heard about an Apple Watch with cellular connectivity. Last year, the feature was rumored for the Apple Watch Series 2, though that never came to fruition. Earlier this month, we ran a poll asking readers what their top requested feature for the Apple Watch Series 3 was. Receiving the most votes was improved battery life, which received 23 percent of votes. Next up was a thinner and lighter design, which came in with 18 percent of votes. Support for cellular connectivity came in third place with 16 percent of the vote. Personally, I would pay around a $50 hardware premium and $5-$10 more per month on my cellular bill for LTE connectivity. If the Apple Watch Series 3 featured LTE connectivity, it would be more capable of acting independent of the iPhone. Apple paved the way for such a feature with the Apple Watch Series 2 and support for GPS. With the combination of LTE and GPS, however, users would be able to pretty much entirely leave their iPhone behind while also staying relatively connected. This would make iPhone-free workouts easier, as well as navigation and other features. Would you pay more for an LTE-equipped Apple Watch? Would you pay a hardware premium and a premium to your carrier, or just one? Let us know your thoughts in the poll above and the comments below.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Computers Should companies be forced to build encryption backdoors into services? Rich Haridy March 27, 2017 The controversial debate over whether tech companies should implement backdoors that allow governments access to encrypted information on digital devices has arisen once again (Credit: BeeBright/Depositphotos) British authorities recently revealed that the Westminster Bridge attacker, who killed four people and injured scores of others, may have sent or received messages through the encrypted WhatsApp service minutes before launching the horrific attack. The revelation has rekindled the controversial debate over whether tech companies should implement backdoors that allow governments access to encrypted information on digital devices. The UK's home secretary, Amber Rudd, threw down the gauntlet on the issue in an interview with the BBC. "We need to make sure that organizations like WhatsApp, and there are plenty of others like that, don't provide a secret place for terrorists to communicate with each other," Rudd said ahead of her upcoming meetings with several technology firms. Sick of Ads? New Atlas Plus offers subscribers an ad free experience. It's just US$19 a year.More Information Last year, WhatsApp instituted end-to-end encryption across all of its communications. This essentially rendered all messages sent through the app unreadable by anyone other than the sender and recipient. "No one can see inside that message," WhatsApp announced last year when unveiling the encryption update. "Not cybercriminals. Not hackers. Not oppressive regimes. Not even us." The current UK/WhatsApp conflict recalls a similar situation last year when the FBI demanded Apple unlock an iPhone recovered from one of the perpetrators of the mass shooting in San Bernardino. Apple resisted the order from the FBI insisting that creating a backdoor into its iPhones would compromise the security of millions of customers. "The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone," Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in a message to the company's customers last year. "But that's simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices. In the physical world, it would be the equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks." After several months of legal stoushes the FBI withdrew its demands, claiming to have unlocked the phone through the services of a "third-party." Some have dubbed this 21st century encryption battle a redux of the infamous 1990s "Crypto Wars." These centered around the NSA's determination to define strong cryptography as a munition. This determination essentially allowed authorities to strongly regulate civilian use of cryptographic algorithms. In 1995, the Electronic Frontier Foundation began a long legal battle, ultimately winning with a ruling declaring that cryptographic algorithms are not weapons, but in fact should be classified as free speech or expression, and therefore protected under the First Amendment. It was a groundbreaking result that has allowed us all a degree of unfettered access to encryption protocols for many years. But our developing smart devices, crossing paths with the modern fear of terrorism, have caused governments to rekindle the encryption battle. The controversy over a company's responsibility to be able to decrypt its users' communications is heating up in the UK. Amber Rudd's latest declarations follow the passing of a bill in November 2016 called the Investigatory Powers Act (euphemistically known as the Snooper's Charter). Among several other contentious provisions, the Act stipulated that communications service providers must have the ability to remove encryption applied by their services. The current Act notably only covers providers operating from within the UK and does not include foreign companies. It's also unclear how this provision would relate to a WhatsApp-styled service. What is clear, though, is that provisions such as these certainly pave the way for laying pressure on companies to ensure they cannot create "uncrackable" services or devices. While it's fair to argue that governments should be able to protect their citizens through responsible and targeted surveillance, it is hard to find a convincing stance on forcing companies to add backdoors to their software or devices. When WhatsApp rolled out its end-to-end encryption in 2016 it was forcing the situation out of its hands. This kind of blanket encryption is secure because it has no backdoor. It is secure because the company itself has no way to crack it. Despite the long-standing privacy versus security debate, there is no way the integrity of an encrypted service can be broken without it compromising the data of all users. Apple CEO Tim Cook succinctly summed it up at a conference in 2015 when he proclaimed, "You can't have a backdoor that's only for the good guys."

Dat is sowieso *altijd* aan te raden bij een update, maar in dit geval is het van nog hoger belang dan normaal. Het update proces is zeer stabiel, en fouten komen nauwelijks voor... Het is veel en zeer goed getest. En tóch is er een verhoogd risico bij deze update dat er iets misgaat, al is het risico erg laag. Neem even dat minuutje de tijd om een backupje te maken, zo gefixed. Better safe than sorry. En als je nog maar weinig ruimte vrij hebt, dan is upgraden via iTunes aan te raden. ... Als je dat gedaan hebt: heel veel plezier met de update! Je telefoon wordt er, mogelijk na een paar uurtjes even caches opbouwen en wat laatste bestandconversies uit te voeren, echt een heel stuk sneller van!

Reageer +1 Carlos0_0 @WhatsappHack • 28 maart 2017 14:22 Mocht de update verkeerd gaan dan hang je hem aan Itunes, in dfu/recovery mode en die je een schone install Dus ja gaat het mis pech ben ik iets langer niet bereikbaar Reageer +1 WhatsappHack Apple iPhone 6s Apple iPhone 6 Plus Apple Apple iPhone 7 Smartphones Apple iPhone 6 Apple iPhone @Carlos0_0 • 28 maart 2017 14:25 Klopt. Het is ook meer een combinatie factor. Als je en geen backup maakt én hem niet aan de lader hangt, dan speel je dusdanig dubbel met vuur dar Satan himself in je nek staat te hijgen.

Ach ja anders een goeie opschoning Reageer 0 Bosmonster @GeforceAA • 28 maart 2017 10:40 Omdat ik geen zin had om op te staan. Maakt het echt uit? Reageer +2 Jeroen O 28 maart 2017 08:08 Het staat volgens mij niet in de release notes, maar voor de telecom fanaten onder ons: De field test app is ook vernieuwd (‭bel naar *3001#12345#*‬). Deze deed het niet op een iPhone 7 of 7 plus, vermoedelijk vanwege de nieuwe Intel modems. De menustruktuur is daarbij veranderd en ziet er naar mijn mening overzichterlijker uit. Tevens is het scherm nu ook aangepast voor grotere schermen. Waarschijnlijk was dit de laatste Apple app met zwarte balken boven en onder het scherm. Helaas wordt niet meer de veldsterke (dBm) weergegeven. Edit: op mijn iPhone SE verschijnt nog de oude field test app, dus vermoedelijk is de nieuwe versie alleen beschikbaar op de iPhone 7 of 7 plus.

Je kan overigens wel nogsteeds de bolletjes links van je providernaam veranderen in -dB. Reageer 0 Jeroen O @WhatsappHack • 28 maart 2017 19:21 Hoe dan? Op de bolletjes tikken zoals in de oude versie werkt niet. Ik kan verder ook geen optie vinden om het in te stellen. Reageer 0 WhatsappHack Apple iPhone 6s Apple iPhone 6 Plus Apple Apple iPhone 7 Smartphones Apple iPhone 6 Apple iPhone @Jeroen O • 28 maart 2017 19:51 *3001#12345#* bellen. Field test start, -dB waardes moeten verschijnen in je balk ipv de bolletjes. Nu power button vasthouden tot uit slider verschijnt, power knop loslaten en nu de homeknop vasthouden tot je terug wordt getrapt naar je homescreen. (Duurt zo'n 5 seconden) Done. Dat is hoe het werkte, op m'n iPhone 7 heb ik dan ook gewoon netjes signaalsterkte in plaats van bolletjes. Oo En ja ik draai 10.3 Reageer 0 Jeroen O @WhatsappHack • 28 maart 2017 20:08 Bij mij werkt dat dus niet. Als ik field test open, blijven daar gewoon de bolletjes staan. Enige verschil is dat ik een iPhone 7 plus heb. Ik zal eens kijken of een herstart van mijn telefoon helpt. Nee dus. Dan maar wachten op een update. De field test mode is toch nog verre van af [Reactie gewijzigd door Jeroen O op 28 maart 2017 20:12] Reageer +2 page404 28 maart 2017 09:27 Alhoewel het een .3 release is, zit hier toch wel een update van formaat achter. Dat APFS is de opvolger van het 31 jaar oude HFS/HFS+ (uit de tijd van floppydisks!) en volledig herschreven om beter te functioneren op mobiele devices en flash- of SSD storage. Het ondersteunt native veel features zoals journaling en snapshots. Bovendien is het een stuk meer secure dan de oude file systems. Het lijkt er ook op dat dit de overgang naar volledige 64 bits apps compleet maakt. Dan te bedenken dat dit nieuwe FS de komende dagen over honderden miljoenen apparaten uitgerold gaan worden, die allemaal een FS conversie krijgen. Best een prestatie vind ik. Stiekem ook benieuwd wat er allemaal nog mis gaat iOS is natuurlijk door zijn gesloten formaat een prima testing ground voor een nieuw FS, voordat het in een update van macOS wordt vrijgegeven. Dan zullen alle problemen met time machine backups en startup disks ook opgelost moeten zijn. Reageer +1 Theo Roeland 28 maart 2017 07:09 Wat is het voordeel van dit nieuwe file systeem? APFS?

Het lijkt erop dat de ruimtewinst afhankelijk is van de grootte van je 'schijf'. Hoe groter de schijf hoe meer ruimte (in absolute hoeveelheden) er vrij komt bij conversie. Een mogelijke reden is dat APFS nu 'space sharing' gebruikt tussen partities zodat de lege ruime op de systeempartitie niet meer onbenut blijft. Mogelijk wijst iOS een bepaald percentage van de schijf toe aan de systeempartitie. Hoe groter de schijf, hoe groter de systeempartitie en hoe meer winst Space Sharing oplevert. Reageer +1 pBook @Maurits van Baerle • 28 maart 2017 10:32 32 GB iPhone 7 hierzo Misschien komt het ook omdat APFS duplicaten maar één keer opslaat, zal een hoop schelen met b.v. je fotorol + photo stream.

Reageer +1 Jeroen O 28 maart 2017 06:39 Ik maak altijd twee backups voordat ik een iOS update ga uitvoeren, zowel een iCloud als iTunes backup. Een iTunes backup kan ik altijd aanbevelen. Waarom? Bij sommige updates zijn de servers van Apple zwaar belast. Met name bij de overgang naar een hele nieuwe versie, zoals van iOS 9 naar 10. Mocht er dan iets fout gaan, dan kan je een snelle herstel via iCloud ook wel vergeten. Met een iTunes backup heb je dat probleem niet, aangezien de backup dan vanaf je PC of Mac wordt geladen. Reageer +1 iAmRenzo @Jeroen O • 28 maart 2017 08:13 Sowieso is een backup via iTunes terugzetten sneller. Mijn iCloud backup is voor de worst case scenarios en mijn iTunes backup maak ik altijd bewust: voor updates of als ik een nieuw toestel krijg.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Apple Looking Into Apple Watch Bands With Added Functionality By Tyler Lee on 03/27/2017 20:09 PDT At the moment the bands offered for the Apple Watch are pretty much purely for aesthetic reasons, which makes sense given that Apple has positioned the Apple Watch as more of a fashion accessory than your average tech gadget. However what if in the future Apple Watch bands were more functional? Apparently that is an idea that Apple is exploring, according to a recently discovered patent in which Apple has come up with various ideas for a more functional band for the Apple Watch. In Apple’s patent, it talks about how the bands on the Apple Watch could be used to display information, alert users to notifications/reminders, or even show the progress of something, like a stopwatch, percentage of a download, the number of steps you’ve taken, and so on. These bands won’t be stuffed with displays, but rather it talks about using an indicator in which only a portion of the band will be lit up. Now this isn’t the first time that it has been suggested that Apple wants to make the bands more functional. A patent from last year suggested that Apple was considering moving the haptic motor into the band itself, resulting in a possibly thinner Apple Watch. However these are just patents meaning that there’s no guarantee that they’ll ever be made a reality, but if you think that the Apple Watch could stand to be more functional, who knows what the Apple Watch Series 3 could bring to the table? Cellular connectivity, perhaps? Filed in Apple >Gadgets. Read more about Apple Watch, Patent, Smartwatch and Wearable Tech.

On the macOS side of things version 10.12.4 marks the arrival of Night Shift to Apple’s desktop operating system, which gradually adjusts the color of your display after sunset, shifting colors to a warmer hue that’s easier on the eye and is supposed to help you more naturally go to sleep. Scientists say that staring at blue light emitted from displays at night can negatively affect a person’s circadian rhythm — that is, it can mess with your sleep patterns and keep you up late. The night shift concept was first popularized by an app called F.lux which is currently available for Android, Windows, and Linux — it was formerly available for iOS and macOS before being removed from the App Store in mid-2016 for a supposedly unauthorized use of the iOS SDK and Xcode. Microsoft is also adding a blue light option in Windows 10 Creators Update, and a few Android handsets have the feature as well. Night Shift for Mac works in similar fashion to Night Shift on iPhone and iPads, users can set custom times for the display's colors to shift from the Displays section of System Preferences. A Toggle to turn Night Shift on is available in the Notification Center and you can also ask Siri to turn it on. Aside from Night Shift, the update also includes dictation support for Shanghainese, cricket score integration for Siri, improved PDFKit APIs, and new iCloud Analytics options. Meanwhile, iOS has been updated to version 10.3, with is likely this version’s last major update before iOS 11 lands sometime in September. The new version marks a shift from the 31-year-old Hierarchical File System (HFS) for iOS devices, to the new Apple File System (APFS). The latter is designed to better take advantage of flash or SSD storage, stronger encryption, improve read and write speeds, and adds support for features like snapshots so restoring files should get a lot easier in the future. While the updated file storage system is the most significant change in iOS 10.3, the update also brings some user-facing improvements like iCloud storage usage breakdown, new (faster) app animations, a new Podcasts app widget, a new ind My AirPods feature and more.

This automation tool for iPad and iPhone has been made free since this acquisition. Shenzhen, Guangdong — (SBWIRE) — 03/27/2017 — As one of the most popular and advanced technology giants, Apple has always been focusing on providing the efficiency of its iPhone and iPad upon both work and leisure entertainment. Today, Apple has finally acquired the Workflow, a tool that could hook together apps and functions within apps in strings of commands to automate tasks, so as to save time and improve efficiency. And since the acquisition, this app Workflow has been made free to all iPhone and iPad users. Apple has always been trying to make things easier on both its computer and iOS devices, so as to let its customers get super experience. iTunes, one of the core products of Apple, is the top example. To help iTunes users easily organize and manage iTunes music library, Apple presets options like "Get Album Artwork", "Show Duplicate Items", etc. There are also wonderful iTunes cleaner software apps on iTunes Store to let people easily download, install and clean up iTunes music library. All these measures have been done to improve the efficiency of Apple's products. Workflow is one of these measures that Apple has been longed for long. Workflow is a personal automation tool, enabling people to drag and drop any combination of actions to create powerful workflows for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. By far, Workflow includes over 200 actions, including those for Contacts, Calendar, Maps, Music, Photos, Camera, Reminders, Safari, AirDrop, Twitter, Facebook, Dropbox, Evernote, iCloud Drive, and Health, to name a few. All these actions could be integrated into Workflow for easier handling and time saving. It opens up infinite possibilities of what people can do with iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. The app was made by a small team that includes Ari Weinstein, a former iPhone jailbreaker, Conrad Kramer, Ayaka Nonaka and Nick Frey. In the past few years, it had built up a sizeable number of users and downloads on iTunes. In 2015, this app even won an Apple Design Award. Now, this app and the team together have been acquired by Apple. "We are thrilled to be joining Apple," said Weinstein in a statement. "We've worked closely with Apple from the very beginning, from kickstarting our company as students attending WWDC to developing and launching Workflow and seeing its amazing success on the App Store." Apple has confirmed the acquisition and made another big important decision by making this app totally free from now on.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 28 March 2017 by Military News Apple Officially Acquired Workflow and Made Workflow a Free App from Now on to Improve Efficiency on iPad and iPhone Shenzhen, Guangdong — (SBWIRE) — 03/27/2017 — As one of the most popular and advanced technology giants, Apple has always been focusing on providing the efficiency of its iPhone and iPad upon both work and leisure entertainment. Today, Apple has finally acquired the Workflow, a tool that could hook together apps and functions within apps in strings of commands to automate tasks, so as to save time and improve efficiency. And since the acquisition, this app Workflow has been made free to all iPhone and iPad users. Apple has always been trying to make things easier on both its computer and iOS devices, so as to let its customers get super experience. iTunes, one of the core products of Apple, is the top example. To help iTunes users easily organize and manage iTunes music library, Apple presets options like „Get Album Artwork”, „Show Duplicate Items”, etc. There are also wonderful iTunes cleaner software apps on iTunes Store to let people easily download, install and clean up iTunes music library. All these measures have been done to improve the efficiency of Apple’s products. Workflow is one of these measures that Apple has been longed for long. Workflow is a personal automation tool, enabling people to drag and drop any combination of actions to create powerful workflows for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. By far, Workflow includes over 200 actions, including those for Contacts, Calendar, Maps, Music, Photos, Camera, Reminders, Safari, AirDrop, Twitter, Facebook, Dropbox, Evernote, iCloud Drive, and Health, to name a few. All these actions could be integrated into Workflow for easier handling and time saving. It opens up infinite possibilities of what people can do with iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. The app was made by a small team that includes Ari Weinstein, a former iPhone jailbreaker, Conrad Kramer, Ayaka Nonaka and Nick Frey. In the past few years, it had built up a sizeable number of users and downloads on iTunes. In 2015, this app even won an Apple Design Award. Now, this app and the team together have been acquired by Apple. „We are thrilled to be joining Apple,” said Weinstein in a statement. „We’ve worked closely with Apple from the very beginning, from kickstarting our company as students attending WWDC to developing and launching Workflow and seeing its amazing success on the App Store.” Apple has confirmed the acquisition and made another big important decision by making this app totally free from now on. According to Apple officials, „The Workflow app was selected for an Apple Design Award in 2015 because of its outstanding use of iOS accessibility features, in particular an outstanding implementation for VoiceOver with clearly labeled items, thoughtful hints, and drag/drop announcements, making the app usable and quickly accessible to those who are blind or low-vision.” About Leawo Software Leawo Software is a multimedia software developer dedicated to providing practical and useful software products and services to worldwide media fans.

The two updates are predominantly maintenance releases, but there are a handful of user-facing highlights between the two. watchOS 3.2 adds Theater Mode. According to the beta release notes published on Apple’s developer site, Theater Mode lets users mute their Watch and disable raise-to-wake. Theater Mode is accessible by swiping up from the bottom of the Apple Watch’s screen. While the feature is engaged, notifications are silent, but you still receive haptic feedback when a notification is received and can view a notification by pressing the Digital Crown. The watchOS update also adds SiriKit support for the following types of activities: Messaging Payments Ride booking Workouts Calling Searching photos SiriKit was originally rolled out as part of iOS 10 last fall. The primary user-facing change to macOS Sierra 10.12.4 is the addition of Night Shift. As with iOS, Night Shift on the Mac changes the color of your display to reduce blue light, giving your screen a warmer, slightly orange cast. There are a couple ways to turn on Night Shift on a Mac. One way is to use Siri to toggle the feature on and off. If you want more control over Night Shift though, the feature is available in System Preferences under Displays. Night Shift occupies its own tab in the Displays preference pane, from which you can turn it on and off manually or set a schedule to activate Night Shift automatically. Schedules include the ability to create a custom schedule or turn it on at sunset and off at sunrise. You can also dial in the exact color temperature that Night Shift uses with a slider. Sierra 10.12.4 includes Touch Bar support for the Mac App Store. In addition to Night Shift, Siri on the Mac now knows about cricket, including data from the Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council. macOS 10.12.4 also adds supports dictation for Shanghainese, updated PDFKit, which was a source of bugs for third-party PDF apps, and added Touch Bar support to the Mac App Store.

Porn-stuffed laptops, positivity police and an anti-gossip gestapo: Welcome to the real Apple Store. Last month, we invited Apple employees to send their pet peeves and horror stories from the front lines of Apple Stores. They did not disappoint. Based on what we heard, the Apple Store seems like a great place to work if you are capable of stowing your ill will, cynicism, frustration and impatience - i.e. humanity - into a little box at the start of each work day and fawn over a stream of idiotic customers without complaint. No wonder people like shopping at the Apple Store so much. The customer from hell I work as an FRS [Family Room Specialist] at an Apple Store, so I see more than my fair share of both good and bad when it comes to working with people, but at the end of the day my goal is to take the very best customer. Even when they treat you badly. I had a woman brought over to me and I could already tell she was upset and didn't want to be here. I asked her what was wrong with her phone and she took it out of her purse and dropped it on the table. She looks me right in the eyes and says "Your fucking phone won't turn on anymore." OK, so it's going to be one of those situations. I ask her when was the last time her phone was working but before I could finish she stops me and states "I don't honestly want to answer any questions, I just want you to either fix my phone or get me a new one. Now, like, right now. Otherwise I'm going to leave this shitty fucking phone here and get a Samsung. Your service here is horrendous and I had to wait twenty minutes just to be seen. FIX. THIS. PROBLEM." Well, I'm no stranger to confrontations and she probably has had a bad day without having a working phone, one of the atrocities that you can suffer if you live in the first world. So I look up her serial number and notice that although her phone is outside its regular one year warranty it qualified for two quality programs that we offer for certain iPhone 5 models. I want to help her despite her being super frustrating to work with. I go to one of my managers and explain the situation and ask if I could just replace her whole unit for another for no cost since it qualified for two quality programs. He has no problem with this, only pointing out that we didn't have a replacement unit in stock but a store, about thirty minutes from my store has several. I get excited and go back to her to explain that although her phone was outside its limited warranty I was going to replace it for her for free since it qualified for two programs. She doesn't seem phased at first, and when I explain that although we don't have the phone in stock I had several phones at another store about thirty minutes from here. "You're telling me to drive to a different location so I can pick up my phone? No, no. Fix this RIGHT NOW. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO, IF YOU HAVE TO DRIVE THERE TO GET IT FOR ME OR HAVE IT BROUGHT TO ME, I WANT YOU TO FIX MY FUCKING PHONE." By now my manager, the one who just okayed replacing the phone for free wants to know what's going on. She starts the exact same thing angry tirade at him. My manager tries to explain that we want to help her out, that she won't need another appointment when she goes to the other store, that it's going to be given to her at no cost, but she isn't having it. She says "Frankly, you guys trying to go above and beyond in terms of helping me makes me sick, I ask you to fix my phone and you want me to drive to another store to get it replaced. No, I don't want a iPhone 5, if you're going to give me a new phone I want a Six Plus. You guys screwed up by not having it in stock and I want you to take care of it." My manager is in shock but plays it cool saying "Well, you can get a iPhone Six Plus, but it's not going to be at 'no cost,' that's just something I can't do." She holds her hand up at him "Stop, never say 'can't' to a customer. I thought this was Apple, not some fly by night operation." My manager looks agitated and I feel like I need to chime in. "Ma'am, with all due respect, if I could drive there and get your phone and bring it back to you I would, but there wouldn't be enough time to do that. If you were to head out now you'd make it there in plenty of time to go and get your new phone. We want to help you, that's all we want to do." She looks at me and then at my manager. "Why can't he drive and get it for me? I'm not leaving until I get a phone." This went back and forth until my manager came up with a great way to help her and get her the phone she so desperately needed. Our quality program allows for the customer to get a loaner phone while the original was being fixed offsite. My manager ran to the back, got the loaner, explained what we wanted to do was give her the loaner and then we would order her a new phone. For whatever reason this worked in her mind. I have never been one to want someone to go away but she was so difficult to work with. Please, please understand we are there to help you. Acting this way doesn't help you or us in getting your issue resolved. Badmouth bans If you speak ill of a customer interaction or of a coworker and any employee overhears you, depending on how much kool-aid they've had to drink, you'll likely be reported to your supervisor. I can't count the number of times my coworkers and I have been pulled into the manager's office to talk about why we're so negative and what we're going to do to correct that. Happy New Year Five minutes before midnight on New Year's Eve, a few blocks from Times Square, a homeless man with a dazed look in his eyes wandered into our Apple Store. The Geniuses on overnight duty eyed him warily as he zigzagged his way to the person checking-in customers. When a genius called out the next appointment's name, that man stumbled toward the bar. Waves of odor washed over so hard that neighbouring Geniuses had to hold their breath. You could smell a decade of the city on the man. He pulled out a brand new iPod touch and set it on the bar. We relaxed a bit. It all seemed legit. Then, he pulled out a jar of his own urine and set that on the bar beside the iPod. The Pickup Artist I gave a One-to-One lesson to a young man I'll call Jonah. He dressed like a prep. I don't think he looked old enough to be in college. So, while his laptop is booting up, he asks me how my love life is. I say none of his business and flash my wedding ring. He tells me he's a pickup artist. He wants to build a website to advertise his pickup artist lessons. He didn't have any clients yet. Jonah looks around at my co-workers. Most are geeks. He tells me he could teach any one of them to pick up any "fox" they wanted. Jonah never calls women anything but "foxes." I didn't have the heart to tell him the guy he was pointing to? Gay. Jonah wants to put a photograph on his website's front page. I think, good idea. Like one of those testimonials, "This is me. If I can get the foxes, so can you!" Instead, what he's got is a cheesy screenshot of a woman he tells me is a Playboy Playmate he took out on a date. Once Jonah slept with her, which he said he "hoped to accomplish soon," he would be in a position to advise others how to do the same. I thought, this guy needs more help than I know how to give in a one-to-one. The next week Jonah got my co-worker, Fred. I made sure to situate my own appointment nearby because I wanted to hear how things went. A minute later, Fred busts out laughing, and we all turn to look. Fred waves that it's all right and regains his composure. "Listen, kid." Fred says. "Thanks, but no thanks. I've forgotten more about dating than you will ever know!" Double-speak There was a whole class we took about things not to say, and what to say instead. One of my favourites was to resist the urge to say "That's stupid" or "That wasn't smart" and replace it with "That's not recommended" - For example, you say "I took my iPod swimming and now it don't work" I say "Ah, that's not recommended" when I mean "That was really stupid". Also, problems aren't "problems" - they're "issues". Buzzwords Managers were instructed to use specific buzz words and phrases when speaking to us. For example, "I'll reach out to you" was a good one. I would often get "reached out to" to attend mandatory store meetings. Even better was the phrase "what questions do you have," instead of "do you have any questions." They use the former because it's supposed to sound more open and welcome to questions. I just thought it sounded scripted. They used it a lot in the training program- I called them out on it and got a lecture on how to communicate with others. Stuck A customer came up to me and put a MacBook, an iPod, and aUSB cable on the table. "I need your help," he said. "Sure," I said. "How can I help you?" "I was copying a song from my computer to my iPod," he said. "OK." "But it never got there." "Do you want to try it again?" "We can't, because the song's not on the computer anymore." "Oh." "It's not on my iPod, either." He hands me the USB cable and says, "It must be stuck in here. Can you get it out for me?' Customer feedback headaches Apple tracks what's called "promoters" and "detractors" and "passives." That receipt we e-mail you when you buy something? You can give us feedback from that e-mail… the system e-mails customers who have had appointments with us, and asks them for their feedback. Basically they are asked a few questions, but the one that comes back to us is "overall satisfaction." Apple expects a 9 or 10 from each interaction. If you get a 7 or 8 that's bad, it's a passive. A detractor automatically means a talk with management. This is another thing that was used to deny promotions and raises, or fire people. The worst thing? It's totally arbitrary. I had customers who loved me and would thank me for my work (because I treated them with respect) and then would give me a 6 because someone else misinformed them about something on a different, previous visit. What has been seen... The amount of porn I saw in data transfers blew my mind. Once a guy got a detractor because a customer blamed US for the fact that, when our tools transferred the data of their old computer over and put photos in iPhoto, there were hoards of gay pornography brought over.

But this doesn’t match with most people’s experiences of calling Centrelink. As it turns out, what’s not included in the reported wait time is probably more important than what is.

Facebook/OnePlus Apple iPhone 8 and OnePlus 5 are highly-anticipated devices that are expected to be released this year. While Apple has always been at the top of the smartphone market, OnePlus has turned out to be a flagship killer, offering some of the best specs in the market but at very affordable prices. However, will the next OnePlus flagship be able to match the power and expectation of the Apple flagship? While none of the manufacturers have released any official information on their devices, it will be interesting to compare the two based on expected specs and features and leaks. OnePlus 5 may soon be announced. The company has really gotten into the habit of producing top-quality smartphones that are taking the world by storm. OnePlus 3T is a prime example of a highly advanced smartphone. It is also considered one of the best Android phones in the market today. OnePlus 5 could be coming with a Snapdragon 835 processor if the company wants to further upgrade the processor in OnePlus 3T. An 8GB RAM, Quad HD display/dual-curved edge AMOLED screen, 23MP rear camera, USB Type-C ports and IP68 rating are some other features that could be added to the upcoming flagship. As the 3T is already boasting some of the best specs in the market today, fans are clueless as to what else OnePlus could include, writes Tech Times. The iPhone killer could also come with a 5.5-inch dual-curved edge AMOLED display. The screen may sport a 4K resolution. Latest 3D technology could be integrated in the device. The smartphone could be released in two variants, 128GB and 64GB. PC Advisor notes that the device may have a 16MP front camera. It will run on the Android 7.0 Nougat operating system. The Apple iPhone 8, on the other hand, will come with iOS 11 and an in-house A11 processor. Internal storage capacities of the phones will range from 64GB to 128GB. The Apple flagship is expected to be either all-glass or all-ceramic. It could feature long-range wireless charging. The iPhone 8 could be coming with a 3D front camera and may also replace Touch ID. In comparison, the OnePlus 5 handset looks equally strong. Both will be packed with killer features though OnePlus will always have the price advantage. The upcoming iPhone will be dropping the physical Home button. Apple is said to be working on three iPhones for this year, one being the special 10th anniversary edition.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley residents will vote on Measure F to decide fate of water acquisition Monday Mar 27, 2017 at 6:53 PM Mar 27, 2017 at 6:53 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — Measure F is the official title of what will appear on the June 6 ballot for a special election that will decide the fate of both the town’s water-acquisition and financial futures. An impartial analysis for Measure F was turned into the San Bernardino County Elections Office on March 20, according to town spokeswoman Kathie Martin. A review of the one-page document shows that much of its language — outside of the measure’s name and that passage requires a simple majority — has been expressed previously, most recently during the March 9 meeting in which the Town Council voted to order the June 6 election. Voter passage of Measure F — i.e. a "yes" vote on June 6 — would allow the town to finance a purchase of the water system currently owned by Liberty Utilities by issuing debt in the maximum amount of $150 million, the analysis shows. As referenced on several occasions by Assistant Town Manager Marc Puckett, though, the analysis notes the town does not expect to issue that much debt for the acquisition. “Although the Town believes the value of the water system is significantly less than $150 million, it seeks approval for a maximum of $150 million because Town finance staff have indicated that is the level of debt for which the Town can pay the debt service through the elimination of profits, taxes, and other avoidable expenses, such as executive compensation, without having to increase rates for water system customers.” The analysis refers to another of Puckett’s claims, stating the town “expects that it would be able to reduce rates for customers of the Apple Valley Water System” if the system is acquired for less than $150 million. Pursuant to the first of three resolutions adopted during the March 9 meeting, the interest rate on debt repayment cannot exceed 12 percent. During that meeting, however, Puckett stated he believes the rate could be as low as 4 percent. Following a review of the analysis, Greg Sorensen — president of Liberty Utilities California — offered a measured response. “While we recognize that the Apple Valley town attorney responsible for producing Measure F’s Impartial Analysis is a partner in the Best, Best & Krieger law firm, we trust that voters will carefully review all available information and make an informed decision,” Sorensen wrote in a statement that references Town Attorney John Brown, whose name is included at the end of the analysis. Martin told the Daily Press last week, however, that Remcho, Johansen & Purcell LLP partner James Harrison wrote the analysis, not Brown. She added that BB&K contracts with Harrison’s firm for that purpose. “State Election Code says it’s the attorneys that write it,” Martin said. Still, Citizens for Government Accountability member Diana Carloni-O’Malley questioned the impartiality of the analysis. “One need only read the not-so impartial analysis, consider who wrote it, and recognize that the Town will do anything to deceive voters into a lifetime ... of debt without stating the true financial impact on the community (e.g. interest on the bonds that must be paid over 30 years),” Carloni wrote in a statement. She called the analysis “pure campaign hype” and said the town “may be violating the law by spending taxpayer money to campaign for, instead of educate the public about, Measure F.” In response, Martin said the analysis is “as impartial as possible.” “It’s all kept separate,” Martin said. “Town staff doesn’t review the impartial analysis, and there is a rebuttal period wherein objections can be made to something in the analysis.” Meanwhile, the county Elections Office is currently working on publishing a website for the election, according to Chief Deputy Registrar Audilia Lozada. “We expect to have it up soon,” Lozada said, “and it will contain information regarding the election, including the analysis and information about the measure.” She added that a voter guide will be published approximately 30 days before the election that will also include the analysis. In the interim, a copy of the impartial analysis can be found here. —Note: the copy obtained from the town did not include an Elections Office phone number. That number is 909-387-8300.

According to a report, they claim that Siri in iOS 11 will apparently be able to learn user behaviors, meaning depending on how you use it, Siri will be able to adapt itself to you and maybe even predict some of your behaviors. The report goes on to add that Apple will integrate Siri with iMessage and offer up iCloud syncing. Whether or not these claims are true remains to be seen, but 9to5Mac points out that Apple has in the past filed patents for similar features, so perhaps it’s not completely out of the question. Let’s not forget that companies like Amazon and Google are already way ahead of Apple in their AI efforts in the form of Alexa and Google Assistant respectively, plus with Samsung announcing Bixby, we’re pretty sure Apple does not want to be seen as lagging behind. Take it with a grain of salt for now, but regular improvements to Siri is something Apple has been working on so like we said, perhaps some of these changes are to be expected, but hopefully we’ll have more details to share at WWDC 2017 come this June.

However according to JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall, he thinks that Apple might try to curb demand for the iPhone 8 with its price tag. Now obviously Apple wants customers to buy the iPhone 8, but to help control demand and to prevent extended waiting times, Hall believes that this could be the reason why Apple could price the iPhone 8 upwards of $1,000. We have heard rumors that the iPhone 8 could be that expensive, and Hall’s report seems to offer a reason as to why that is, along with the fact that its BOM will be higher due to the new features like an OLED display, 3D scanning cameras, wireless charging, and so on. According to Hall, he estimates that the iPhone 8 (or iPhone Pro as he calls it) will cost $65 more than the iPhone 7. We have heard that the iPhone 8 could be launched in limited quantities, so it makes sense that Apple will want to control some of the demand to prevent orders from spiraling out of control. In any case we guess we’ll just have to wait and see what the situation is when the phone launches, but assuming all the iPhone 8 rumors are true, Apple will no doubt have another winner on their hands and will be looking at another “super cycle”.

However if you’re not a fan of physical remotes, or maybe you lost it and don’t want to buy a new one, there is always the iPhone version that you can use. However if you wanted a bit more screen real estate, you’ll be pleased to learn that the app has recently been updated to support the iPad. By all accounts it seems that the iPad version is essentially the same version as the iPhone app. However given that the iPad has a much larger display, we guess things are a bit more “spacious” and stretched out, which may or may not be a good thing depending on you. However the good part is that the so-called blank space above the controls acts as one giant touchpad, so you’ll be able to swipe freely without worrying about hitting the other controls. That being said there are some differences between the app. According to Apple, this comes in the form of an enhanced “Now Playing” experience where the lyrics and playlists for music, chapters, and audio tracks are more visible/accessible. Users will also be able to move the persistent buttons around the screen depending on what makes you comfortable, according to a tweet by Apple’s Justin Voss. The update to the Apple TV remote should already be live, so if you’re interested then head on over to the iTunes App Store and check it out. Filed in Apple >Tablets.

Credit Suisse released a report last week that suggested Amazon's entry could be rated as somewhere between "Catastrophe" and "We're all going to die". But is it all Amazon's fault? There's no control experiment we can conduct to see what will actually happen when Amazon enters the local market. But when a new entrant joins a market, there are a few things that can happen. The market can expand. We saw this when Google released Android. While Android devices outsell iOS, Apple's sales are still solid after a period of growth. When Google entered the market they didn't take Apple's customers; they added new customers to the smartphone market. If the market is mature, then the likelihood is a new entrant will take customers away from incumbents. Think of Netflix and the corner video rental store. Or corner stores when supermarkets extended their trading hours. Most experts expect retail to follow the Netflix/video store path rather than the Android/iOS one. There's a big difference though. Big retail has had a 15 year window to get ready. Online commerce is not new. As soon as the Internet became a commercial platform, people started selling stuff over it. Also, large retailers could learn the lessons of the bookstore business and from video rentals and Netflix. Macy's in the US is a good case study of why local retail is going to have its work cut out for it in order to compete with Amazon and other online retailers. And we're seeing what some call a "retail mall apocalypse" taking place with over 3,500 stores being shut down by retailers like Macy's, JCPenney, Sears, and Kmart, Crocs, BCBG, Abercrombie & Fitch, and Guess. Some of the chains are closing hundreds of stores this year. Macy's is more than a department store - it's a symbol for traditional retail. Their business model is large stores that are heavily staffed selling a wide variety of goods. Almost every city in the US has a Macy's store - the one in New York is practically a tourist attraction. But the chain has struggled over recent years and their long term CEO stepped down this year. Comments by their CFO, Karen Hoguet, says their most significant existential threat isn't Amazon. In a recent interview CNBC story, Hoguet said the issue is their supply chain. And a walk through local stores highlights that the same challenge exists here. Customers want to buy what what they want to buy when they want to buy it. Online retailers like Amazon make this easy. And if you don't know what you want, Amazon's recommendation system will tell you! The answer from local retailers to these challenges has been typically myopic. There's been the gnashing of teeth over GST on imports with the government now threatening to collect GST on personal imports. What Harvey and his mates don't understand is that we don't just buy online because of the price (although that is part of the allure). We buy online because we can find what we want, when we want it and get it shipped cheaply. It's a combination of price, product and service. Penalty rates have been cut. Again, when under pressure local retailers revert to their default position of cutting costs by screwing those who can least afford to be screwed. When was the last time you read about an executive management team who took a pay cut rather than cut coal-face salaries? US retailer TJ Maxx is planning to enter the Australian market and their model could be an insight into the sort of retail experience that can survive and thrive locally. I shopped at TJ Maxx when on holidays last year (in the lovely town of Bend in Oregon. If you're into outdoor sports like trail running, paddle boarding and canoeing, skiing and the like, you need to go to Bend). It is an impulse shopper's paradise. TJ Maxx has a rapidly changing inventory that is driven by two factors. What is available and what can be quickly sold. It's a simple formula. But I'll bet you can walk into a large Australian retailer and find items that are months old sitting on a rack. That doesn't happen at TJ Maxx. If you walk into Myer, JB HiFi or any other retail chain in Australia, you'll find the same items in the same place in each store. TJ Maxx puts its inventory wherever it can place it as quickly and cheaply as they can. Say you want to buy a hat. Just because you see it at one TJ Maxx store there's no guarantee, if fact there's almost no chance, you'll find it at another outlet. That model might not work for everyone and Australian shopping habits are different to those in the US. Our population is far more centralised with most of the population living in large urban centres. So we are accustomed to a more tactile shopping experience. But that is changing as more of us move our shopping dollars online. I'm pretty sure that when Amazon officially starts trading in Australia that the lead story on all the current affairs shows will be Gerry Harvey bleating about foreign retailers screwing Aussie businesses. Harvey and his counterparts have had over a decade to prepare for this. To compete, they will need a multi platform strategy with a 21st century supply chain. That will include retail stores, but it's likely they will be a lot smaller and only stock large items like furniture, white goods and major appliances. Commodity items that can be easily and cheaply shipped will slowly disappear and only be sold online - it makes no sense to ship printer ink from a manufacturer to a warehouse, to a store in the hope it will be purchased off the shelf. Skipping the store and shipping to the customer from the warehouse should result in a cost reduction that could be passed on to the customer. This will, theoretically reduce prices and allow them compete with new market entrants. And, as warehouses are cheaper to own and manage than retail stores, there's further opportunity to reduce costs. With more people needed in warehouses, employment will shift. While job losses are possible, I expect to see job changes account for many of the lost store jobs with people shifting from shopping centres to warehouses. It won't be as sexy, but it will be a job. the Big retail still has some time to get their stuff together. But the clock is ticking and, so far, there hasn't been any evidence that they are prepared to adapt to the new world. I guess blaming Amazon in the 21`st century is easier than admitting your 19th century business model is broken. Amazon Is About To Kick Traditional Retail’s Butt We are at the dawn of a new era - and like the dinosaurs who just thought they were having an off day - many Aussie retailers aren’t going to know what’s hit them. In the coming months Amazon will start opening its online doors in Australia. And already locals are seeing an impact.

And you think Amazon will be paying over the odds for staff. Google 'Amazon Workers' and get a feel for the Worker's Nirvana Amazon employees face. Don't get me wrong. While traditional retail will need to lift their game to compete, let's not pretend any of the new entrants will have any altruistic motives. Reply 1 Anthony Caruana @anthonycaruana AUTHOR Mar 28, 2017, 4:08pm Amazon will pay, I assume, the lowest they can legally pay. But the motivation for the recent cut in rates is about cost cutting by the incumbents. As far as I know Amazon was not involved in lobbying for the recent penalty rate cuts. Reply 0 anthonyp69 @anthonyp69 Mar 28, 2017, 12:59pm What warehouses is this author talking about? Most retails don't use their own warehouses anymore, unless they import stock themselves. They will pull in stock from the importer/wholesalers warehouse. The Importer/wholesaler generally doesn't do retail. Amazons model only works if they import and warehouse all their inventory. Most branded products in Australia will already be imported under a licensed importer. Reply 1 Anthony Caruana @anthonycaruana AUTHOR Mar 28, 2017, 4:05pm It doesn't matter, in my view, whose warehouse. If more stuff moves from warehouses to customers then the warehouse operators will need to increase their slicking and shipping capacity Reply 0 Cameron @moonhead Mar 28, 2017, 5:01pm I look at Bunnings as one that's ripe for disruption. They have an utterly pathetic web presence right now, If Amazon handle hardware well, can deliver the core range Bunnings have (which wouldn't be hard with their hopeless range), and can sort out deliveries properly, they'll (hopefully) smack Bunnings around enough to actually get some real competition into the sector!

One of the most notable new features, however, is for AirPods users. Apple has expanded its Find My iPhone feature to support AirPods, making it incredibly easy for users to quickly find their AirPods if they misplace them. Read on for full instructions on how to take advantage of Find My AirPods… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case The first thing worth noting is that Find My AirPods isn’t quite as sophisticated as Find My iPhone. For instance, the AirPods must be connected to the iPhone via Bluetooth to work. This means that if the AirPods are too far away, you won’t get the full feature set, though Apple will help you track them down the best that it can. How to use Find My AirPods Find My AirPods is accessible just like Apple’s other “Find” services for Mac, iPhone, iPod, and Apple Watch. To track your AirPods, you can do so via either iCloud.com or the “Find iPhone” app on iPad and iPhone. To use the feature, open the Find iPhone app and look for “AirPods” in your list of devices. From there, you can see where your AirPods are located on a map and in relation to your other Apple products. If you tap the AirPods icon on the map, you’ll see the option to play a sound from the AirPods. After you start playing the sound, you’ll see the option to mute the left or the right AirPod, or stop playing the sound. The ability to mute either AirPod makes it easier to locate one or the other if you’ve only misplaced one of them. While the sound that is emitted from the AirPods isn’t the loudest, it should be loud enough to locate a misplaced earbud in a relatively quiet environment. An important thing to note is that all of these steps apply only if the AirPods are out of their case and connected to your iPhone.  If you have an AirPod that you’ve left behind at another location or that isn’t connected to your iPhone, you’ll see the last known location on map and hitting the “Play Sound” button will present a “Sound Pending” message: You will receive a notification when these AirPods connect to a paired device. Apple’s new Find My AirPods feature is pretty useful for locating nearby AirPods, though less so for ones that you may have left at another location. Nevertheless, given the technical hurdles, the feature is useful and much-needed considering the truly wireless design of the AirPods. Have you had an instance of losing an AirPod? Was Find My AirPods useful? Let us know down in the comments. Chance Miller @ChanceHMiller Chance covers Apple for 9to5Mac and contributes to 9to5Google, Electrek, and 9to5Toys.

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home World news Facebook hires Apple veteran Hillman to run Oculus VR hardware Facebook hires Apple veteran Hillman to run Oculus VR hardware Facebook Inc. has hired Michael Hillman, a 15-year veteran of Apple Inc., as head of hardware for its Oculus VR division. By: Bloomberg | New Delhi | Updated: March 28, 2017 6:21 AM t Oculus, Hillman will work closely with Hans Hartmann, Oculus’s chief operating officer, according to Oculus spokeswoman Andrea Schubert.(Reuters) Facebook Inc. has hired Michael Hillman, a 15-year veteran of Apple Inc., as head of hardware for its Oculus VR division. Hillman held senior engineering and design roles at Apple, and he helped develop consumer products such as the popular iMac desktop computer, according to his LinkedIn profile. His experience launching consumer products will be key to Oculus delivering on its ambitious goal of taking virtual reality hardware mainstream. At Oculus, Hillman will work closely with Hans Hartmann, Oculus’s chief operating officer, according to Oculus spokeswoman Andrea Schubert. Hartmann joined Oculus last year after serving in that same role at Fitbit. A now-removed job listing for the head of hardware job said the person will “set the strategy and execute on our consumer product roadmap” in addition to building and leading the hardware organization. The hire comes after Facebook recruited another big name, Xiaomi Corp.’s Hugo Barra, to oversee all of virtual reality. Barra hasn’t started yet, the company said. Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg envisions virtual reality as the next major computing platform after mobile phones. Still, the company faces major competition from others who have more experience building out a hardware business, such as HTC Corp. and Microsoft Corp. Oculus currently sells a few products, ranging from its flagship Rift headset and controller to the Gear VR attachment for the latest Samsung phones. In order to push its headsets more mainstream, Oculus will need to eventually untether its powerful Rift headset from being tied to a desktop PC. Oculus has demonstrated a prototype for such a device, codenamed Santa Cruz, but has not indicated plans to ship such a product in the near-term. The Facebook division will also need to continue to lower the price of the device if it will compete with gaming systems from the likes of Sony and Microsoft, Oculus co-founder Jack McCauley told Bloomberg News earlier this month. The company recently slashed pricing of both the Rift headset and touch controller by $100. You may also like to watch this video Across his career at Apple, Hillman rose through the ranks in desktop computer design, beginning as a lead designer on the iMac, and then serving multiple managerial roles until becoming the chief architect of all Apple desktop computers.

Dan Goodin - Mar 28, 2017 12:44 am UTC Lookout reader comments 61 Share this story Ransomware scammers have been exploiting a flaw in Apple's Mobile Safari browser in a campaign to extort fees from uninformed users. The scammers particularly target those who viewed porn or other controversial content. Apple patched the vulnerability on Monday with the release of iOS version 10.3. The flaw involved the way that Safari displayed JavaScript pop-up windows. In a blog post published Monday afternoon, researchers from mobile-security provider Lookout described how exploit code surreptitiously planted on multiple websites caused an endless loop of windows to be displayed in a way that prevented the browser from being used. The attacker websites posed as law-enforcement actions and falsely claimed that the only way users could regain use of their browser was to pay a fine in the form of an iTunes gift card code to be delivered by text message. In fact, recovering from the pop-up loop was as easy as going into the device settings and clearing the browser cache. This simple fix was possibly lost on some uninformed targets who were too uncomfortable to ask for outside help. "The attackers effectively used fear as a factor to get what they wanted before the victim realized that there was little actual risk," Lookout researchers Andrew Blaich and Jeremy Richards wrote in Monday's post. Blaich and Richards said they first learned of the attacks when someone using iOS version 10.2 reported losing control of Safari after visiting the website pay-police[.]com. The user provided the screenshot shown above, which attempts to instill fear with the claim the device was being locked "for illegal pornography." Below those words was a pop-up Window that said "Cannot Open Page." Each time the person clicked on the accompanying OK button, a new window would open again. The JavaScript used in the attack shows signs of being used to exploit the same Safari flaw present in iOS version 8, which was released in 2014. The attackers, the Lookout researchers said, purchased a large number of domains in an attempt to "catch users that are seeking controversial content on the internet and coerce them into paying a ransom to them." Sites tailored the messages they delivered based on country identifiers. iOS users who are hit by the scam can clear their browsing cache by going into settings > Safari > Clear History and Website Data. The campaign in many respects resembles one that hit Android users in 2014. That one demanded a $300 ransom paid in the form of mechanisms such as Paysafecard or uKash.

That said, it boggles my mind that someone would believe that "the police" would demand payment of a fine in the form of an iTunes gift card. In fairness, demanding iTunes gift cards is at least 30% less crazy than 'civil asset forfeiture'; and that's entirely nonfiction. The really suspicious part is how you can settle the entire matter without a lawyer and any procedural hassles. 4039 posts | registered 7/2/2012 Dan Goodin Dan is the Security Editor at Ars Technica, which he joined in 2012 after working for The Register, the Associated Press, Bloomberg News, and other publications.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. By Glenn Fleishman Senior Contributor, Macworld | Mar 27, 2017 5:15 PM PT Credit: Apple More like this How to choose the best Wi-Fi replacement for your Apple AirPort routers Review: Refined iOS 6 highlighted by stunning Maps overhaul The 10 must-have utilities for macOS Sierra Video Tim Cook speaks cybersecurity at Stanford Earlier on Monday, my wife let me know that “Apple Support” had called about iCloud security. She was dubious, and rightly so. “Apple” then called five more times (and counting). Suffice it to say, it wasn’t Apple, but fraudsters trying to piggyback on reports that a major breach of iCloud credentials could render hundreds of millions of accounts vulnerable. Apple says no such breach occurred, and security researchers, like Troy Hunt of HaveIBeenPwned.com, say the group trying to extort Apple likely has reused credentials from other sites’ password leaks. (We recommend turning on two-factor authentication at iCloud regardless.) However, media reporting an potential iCloud security failure makes unsolicited calls claiming to be from Apple more credible. My wife wasn’t taken in, but also didn’t immediately dismiss the call. She hung up, and then told me about it. We have Apple devices and both use iCloud, and we have regular issues with iCloud not working precisely as we expect. While Macworld readers may already know these sorts of calls are a scam, it’s vital to alert friends, family, and colleagues about such calls and help immunize them from falling for it. Many of these services sound and act professional, and have been victimizing Windows users for years. Below are some of the “tells” for me that it was a fraud, and that you can teach others about: Apple called unsolicited: I’ve never had Apple call me—a consumer—for any reason I can recollect unless I called them first, and it’s always a human being calling back. Apple notes this on its phishing tips page: “If you get an unsolicited call from someone claiming to be from Apple, hang up and contact us directly.” (Microsoft, Google, and others never place unsolicited calls, either.) The call was automated: The call used a fairly cheap sounding computer-synthesized voice. An Apple automated call would be much higher quality, and probably use a real person (or at worst, a Siri analog). We never give this number out: This is a home line we use effectively as a backup and for outgoing calls only. I can check via the Apple ID site which phone numbers I have provided, too. The message didn’t provide details: It offered an unfamiliar 855 toll-free number, and didn’t provide an apple.com address at which more details could be found or verified. The message offered to put me through “to a support adviser right now”: This is not what Apple calls its staff, nor a likely thing for Apple to offer. The Caller ID number didn’t say Apple on it: Caller ID can be faked (there’s no verification process), but the number displayed is from Milwaukie, Wisconsin. I also feel bad for the person whose number was impersonated. I found a real person’s name associated with the number via a reverse search and his address. The Caller ID number has a shady history: The 855 number provided, when I searched on it via Google, has been used for at least a week with “Apple Support” scams. They called back multiple times: If I wasn’t sure at first, the five additional calls throughout the day make it clear it wasn’t Apple. A common threat These scams are abundant in a lot of different ways, though they typically target Windows users, either through unsolicited calls or pop-up messages on sites of dubious quality, because of the sheer number of Windows users. They try to get you to let them connect to your computer via a reverse screen share using one of the many free sites that provide person-to-person screen sharing and control. Then, they claim to have scanned your computer, found malware, and ask for payment so they can “fix” your computer. In the process, they install adware and sometimes malware, as well as charge a high or recurring fee on your credit card or both. Try to help those you know train themselves to be alert for scams, whether they come from an unsolicited call or via a pop-up, and call or text you (or, with work, an IT support person) first before they provide any personal information or credit-card details. These scams rely on fear and plausibility. By teaching people what to look for and, most importantly, to confirm details and wait before acting, you can help subvert them.

A decade ago, the most respected domestic brands in China were those attached to clothing, shoes and other small items. Nowadays, Chinese appliance brand Haier, e-commerce platform Alibaba, and personal computer manufacturer Lenovo are well recognised, and showcase China's rapid growth and aspiration for dominance in innovation and technology. Perhaps nothing better demonstrates this change than low-cost Chinese smartphone manufacturers. Recent surveys have shown the good quality and low prices of domestic high-tech smartphones have dramatically increased in reputation to become among the most trusted brands in China. China is the world's largest market for smartphones, and one that is growing rapidly. Global technology analyst firm Canalys recently reported that for the full year 2016, China reached 476.5 million unit shipments of smartphones, growing year-on-year at 11.4 per cent -- vastly up on 2015's growth rate of 1.9 per cent. The last quarter of 2016 saw smartphone shipments in China reach 131.6 million units -- the highest single quarter total in history and accounting for nearly a third of worldwide shipments. Leading the charge in the Chinese smartphone market are Huawei, Oppo and Vivo. Their rankings jump around depending on how the data you use is captured (shipments to resellers, reported sales, phone activations), but all have experienced strong growth in sales numbers over the past year. Traditionally, Huawei has focused on China's larger tier-1 and tier-2 cities, with Oppo and Vivo targeting rural areas and medium cities -- although that is changing as all three look to aggressively expand their market share. The Chinese smartphone market is not without its challenges. Xiaomi was once considered by many to be the "Apple of China". Xiaomi's CEO, Lei Jun, has been on a mission to "change the world's view of Chinese products". Continued below. Related Content Barry Soper: Deals with China won't do us much harm Huawei plans $400m investment in NZ Tim McCready: Alibaba offers sweet deals Yet Xiaomi has slipped to fourth place in the Chinese smartphone war, and is the only one of the top brands to decrease its shipments in smartphones over the last year. The company sold enough to keep comparatively expensive Apple at fifth place, but has struggled with poor reviews and hasn't been able to keep pace with the innovation, marketing, and investment into distribution channels of its domestic competitors. Chinese vendors are getting strong and stronger at innovation," he said, expecting Huawei to spend US$10 billion on research and development this year -- about the same figure as Apple spends. Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei Consumer Business Globally, Chinese brands are making big strides into international markets. Earlier this year at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), an annual tradeshow for consumer electronics held in Las Vegas, many analysts reported that China's presence marked a big change. Chinese companies were present in record numbers -- 1575 exhibitors compared with 1755 from the United States, showcasing strong innovation and technologies including smartphones with high specifications and advanced cameras. Huawei was one of the early smartphone entrants into Western markets, and has become the first Chinese company to chip away at what has been South Korea's and the United States' stronghold on the industry, claiming third place in the fiercely competitive global smartphone market just behind Samsung and Apple. Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei Consumer Business Group, said at CES that Samsung's woes over the past year with the Note 7 catching on fire provided more fuel to the company to push ahead as a serious player in the market. Yu believes China deserved its previous reputation for being an imitator. "Chinese vendors are getting strong and stronger at innovation," he said, expecting Huawei to spend US$10 billion on research and development this year -- about the same figure as Apple spends. This partnership has been outstanding for Huawei, building our profile in Australasia, and providing amazing experiences for our customers and friends in New Zealand. Guo Ping, Huawei global rotating CEO Huawei continues to push its brand in New Zealand -- it is a regular on television adverts and billboards around the country. Last year Huawei and the Wellington Phoenix signed the largest sponsorship deal in New Zealand football history, extending their initial three-year partnership for at least another three seasons. At the time, Huawei global rotating CEO Guo Ping said connecting with football fans through the Phoenix had been a huge part of growing the brand in New Zealand. "This partnership has been outstanding for Huawei, building our profile in Australasia, and providing amazing experiences for our customers and friends in New Zealand." It seems to be working. Huawei has grown to third position in terms of share of total shipments to New Zealand, growing to 21 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2016. That compared with 31 per cent of the market for Apple and 26 per cent for Samsung. Other Chinese brands are yet to crack the New Zealand market to the same degree. Oppo is one would-be player, having signed exclusive agreements with 2Degrees and JB Hi-Fi to sell their handsets. This represents a natural next step for the Chinese producer, having enjoyed 700 per cent year-on-year growth in its Australian market share in the fourth quarter of 2016 (reaching 2.9 per cent of the market). Global producers of smartphones have struggled to expand into China, and yet Chinese producers are rapidly accelerating into other parts of the world. In the 2000s, Finland was the epicentre of phone manufacturing, with Nokia a ubiquitous staple in everyone's hands. Whether or not Nokia's recent relaunch will shake the industry up remains to be seen, but in the first quarter of 2016 Huawei sold 10 times as many phones as Apple did in Finland. Last October Huawei passed Samsung to claim the top spot of the smartphone market there. High specifications and low prices might just be a winning formula for Huawei and others to take on Apple and Samsung -- the top players in the industry since 2011 -- and expand their dominance in China and Finland to the world. - NZ Herald By Tim McCready Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Apple had previously announced that developers would be able to reply to app reviews, but now the company has offered up more details. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case In a post on its developer blog, Apple outlined two new features that come with the new StoreKit API available in iOS 10.3. First, the company says that the API allows customers to provide App Store ratings and reviews without leaving a developer’s app. This presumably will help increase the amount of customers who provide reviews and ratings: In-App Ratings and Reviews The new StoreKit API available on iOS 10.3 makes it easy for customers to provide App Store ratings and reviews without leaving your app. Simply choose when you’d like to prompt the user, and the system takes care of the rest. Apple also offered more details on support for developers replying to reviews. Apple says that when a developer replies to a review, the user will receive a notification that the developer has replied: Responding to Customers You can now publicly respond to customer reviews of your app on the App Store for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. When you respond, the customer is notified and has the option to update their feedback. More information regarding the new ratings and reviews features on iOS can be found on Apple’s official developer website.

"It's an awful feeling, I feel like I've been abused," said the host, who does not want to encourage any links to the false listing, so has asked not to be named.  "You put all your hard work into doing something right, you sign all these Airbnb agreements and then some guy just comes along and swipes your profile picture and violates all their terms and it stays up there." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The most recent listing of the fake 'Bondi Beach' pad, which is in fact in Florida. Photo: Airbnb He said he has contacted Airbnb "at least four or five times," spending up to 30 minutes on the phone "getting absolutely nowhere". "They take it down after a long process and then it's up again the next day. They tell me all these things, that I'm a high priority, all this rubbish, but I've wasted my time. As far as I've seen it's been up there for at least one week." Advertisement In 2016 the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission recorded almost 200 complaints about fraudulent Airbnb listings, resulting in $88,000 in consumer losses. Complaints last year had tripled since 2015, when there was $65,000 reported lost to these scams. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Bondi or Florida? An image taken from the fraudulent Airbnb listing, which has been removed.  This week is at least the third time the Florida-based home has been listed on Airbnb as located in Bondi Beach. After its initial report in February, Fairfax Media was informed by more than one consumer that they had reported the same listing to the platform in December last year. Fraudulent activity on the home-sharing platform is managed by Airbnb's global Trust and Safety team, which works "24/7" to prevent fraud and permanently ban "bad actors".   SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The profile of the genuine Airbnb superhost account, which was ripped off by the fake listing. Images: supplied Photo: Airbnb An Airbnb Australia spokesman would not respond to questions about how fake accounts are monitored, nor what mechanisms are used to identify bad actors, but said the platform was "constantly looking for ways to stay ahead of fraudsters". "Airbnb is a secure online platform, and the only way scams can succeed is if the bad actor convinces you to contact them off of the platform and then gets you to wire them money directly." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link A US real estate listing for the Florida house, images of which were used in a fraudulent Airbnb listing.  Airbnb again removed the fake listing after it was contacted by Fairfax Media on Monday. ACCC deputy chairwoman Delia Rickard advises all consumers to never make a payment outside the official Airbnb website.   "Anytime you are asked to pay via a wire transfer or gift card, anything that is difficult to trace, that should tell you it's a scam," she told Fairfax Media in February. For the genuine host that was recently scammed by the listing, the experience has been a red flag that not only guests are targeted by fraudsters.                                              "Building a good name is everything to me. I want to do everything to the best of my ability and I've done that. But then for some guy to come and take that away from you by using your face is alarming on multiple levels," he said.   Facebook - Savvy Consumer Latest consumer news Advertisement Follow Savvy Consumer Tip us off and keep across the latest stories and recall alerts.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley mulls the small-cell future as carriers eye rights-of-way for 5G Monday Mar 27, 2017 at 4:36 PM Mar 28, 2017 at 9:02 AM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — As wireless carriers progress toward the 5th Generation (5G) of mobile networks, cities are looking to cash in on the carriers’ need to move away from large cell towers. The industry shift is geared toward small-cell sites, base stations that densify network capacity in designated spaces to augment the towers' wider coverage areas. Towers are traditionally erected in rural areas or on rooftops; however, according to 5 Bars LLC National Vice President of Communities Greg Steininger, the advent of small cell has directed carrier interest to cities’ rights-of-way — i.e. places closer to the public. As a result, potential revenue generation exists for cities that offer rights-of-way as small-cell sites, and Apple Valley could be the next in a growing list of municipalities to do just that. Steininger laid out the services 5 Bars could offer should the town move to harbor small-cell sites. “(We'd) be looking at Apple Valley’s assets,” Steininger said. “You’ve got city buildings, you’ve got light posts. You’ve got parks in areas, bus stops. And the carriers are looking at all those assets and areas within the right-of-way to place small cells and densify the area.” By Steininger’s estimation, upward of 1 million small-cell sites will exist in the U.S. within the next three to five years. They’ve been introduced in places like Sacramento and St. Louis, he said, and 5 Bars is involved in talks with Irvine and Redlands, as well. “Many of (these communities) have come to us because the carriers are coming to them with large quantities of small-cell sites to be approved,” Steininger said, “and each one of them (the proposals) is about an inch thick.” So 5 Bars involves itself in the master planning of small-cell sites to advocate for municipalities and market the aforementioned assets to carriers like Sprint and Verizon. Part of a master plan, according to Steininger, includes the aesthetics of small-cell sites. Small cells are similar in size to “a large shoebox,” and examples provided showed what sites without plans — read: sites where carriers go in and “do what they want” — look like. Think of light poles covered in large shoe boxes — what Steininger called “frankenpoles” — which tend to be eyesores that draw the ire of residents. To avoid that, Steininger said 5 Bars works with cities to ensure rights-of-way remain conducive to the overall aesthetics of cities. And because 5G is a “must-have” for carriers, there’s room for negotiation. “The carriers, in order to go to 5G, have to move toward this densification model,” Steininger said. “So ... we developed a plan that creates a wireless model that we build with the city at no cost to the city ... and we advocate on behalf of the city with the carriers to create acceleration in the process." The number of needed sites depends on subscribers per square foot, according to Steininger’s colleague Joe Sutton, who said it’s difficult to predict that need. “As the applications evolve, and they become more data intensive, the usage goes up and more sites need to go in,” Sutton said. “Some studies have shown that the typical ratio is one small cell per 1,000 people, and it may increase 5G to one per 500.” At the town’s current population, then, a minimum of 70 small-cell sites — a number Steininger referenced as an example — would be necessary. With regard to small cells, Steininger advises “future-proofing the city” to create “smart-city innovation, Internet of things and just moving technology forward” for carriers, residents and businesses. “Keeping and staying ahead of the game ... seems to be a pertinent thing to do,” Town Manager Frank Robinson said. However, doing so likely will require a great deal of staff work and research. The town’s Municipal Code does address wireless telecommunications, towers and antennas; however, revisions would be needed should the Council bite on small-cell sites. “It is not addressed in the current Development code,” town spokeswoman Kathie Martin confirmed last week, “and is something we would evaluate if the town decided to move forward with the services of 5 Bars.” Meanwhile, the Federal Communications Commission recently became involved in the 5G future, which could arrive as early as 2020. Last November, Mobilitie LLC, a wireless-solutions company, petitioned the FCC to set guidelines to expedite site acquisition for wireless infrastructure. The petition came after the FCC’s Wireless Telecommunications Bureau released an agreement last August to remove “regulatory burdens for infrastructure deployments,” according to WTB Chief Jon Wilkins. ““The agreement will deliver an immediate and meaningful impact on 5G because ... high-speed 5G services requires high-speed infrastructure deployment,” Wilkins said in a statement. Additionally, Sen. Ben Hueso, D-San Diego, introduced SB 649 in February, which would permit the deployment of said infrastructure statewide sans local “discretionary review,” according to the bill’s language. An Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee hearing on SB 649 is set for April 4, the California Legislature’s website shows. As such, Steininger implied that time is of the essence. “If a state enacts some type of legislation,” Steininger said, “that can override the rights or the ability of cities to use or leverage their assets ... If you’re in a contract with a company like 5 Bars, and that legislation is enacted, there’s a grandfather clause ... and you would not be beholden to that legislation.” The Council has yet to enter into such a contract, but Martin confirmed the town has received applications for small-cell sites from carriers.

Even macOS is getting in on the update action today with the inclusion of the eyestrain-reducing Night Shift mode. But, we digress: for fans of Apple's more mobile tech, however, the pot gets that much sweeter. iOS 10.3 and watchOS 3.2 have launched, with each platform bringing new features to Apple's phones, tablets, and smartwatches. Without further ado, let's look at what both mobile operating systems are due for with their latest updates and how you can get each running on your devices as soon as possible. iOS 10.3 The newest iteration of iOS adds much-needed AirPods support to the "Find My iPhone" feature, allowing those who've (understandably) misplaced one of their wireless earbuds to ping it on a map or play a sound to help pick it out of a messy room or cluttered bag. iOS 10.3 also beefs up Apple's digital assistant, Siri, adding increased support for checking pending bills on payment apps, scheduling trips via ridesharing apps, and even monitoring fuel, locks, and lights for your car with certain automaker apps. Speaking of which, Apple CarPlay also gets some love from iOS 10.3, primarily shortcuts for accessing recent applications and even curated playlists courtesy of Apple Music. Finally, other additions of note from iOS' newest iteration include the ability to watch rented iTunes movies across multiple devices, 3D Touch and widget support for the Podcast app, and the ability to delete unwanted invites in the Calendar app and mark them as junk. To get your hands on iOS 10.3, open the Settings app on your device, go to the General tab, and then find "Software Update." Make sure you're connected to Wi-Fi and plugged into a charger to save on data and battery, though! watchOS 3.2 (Image: © Apple) For fans of Apple's wrist-mounted supercomputer, a whole new version of watchOS is out for the Apple Watch. Among the more prominent new features for the Watch is Theater Mode, another long-awaited trick that prevents the screen from waking up when you move your wrist and mutes incoming messages — an especially courteous move for the next time you're as the cinema. The latest version of watchOS 3.2 also carries SiriKit, which allows the digital assistant to work with third-party apps on your Watch. The kind of apps developers can integrate Siri with via Apple Watch are limited to certain sectors — such as payment, transportation, and fitness — but it is nonetheless a welcome addition. To update to watchOS 3.2, you'll first need to update your tethered iPhone to the latest version of iOS (see above.)  Next, while both the Watch and iPhone are charged and connected to Wi-Fi, open the Apple Watch app, tap the My Watch tab, then hit the General tab and find "Software Update."

The update is known to bring Night Shift, a feature that automatically adjusts the display colors at night to help users get to sleep easily once they are done using their Mac laptop or computer.  For users who have yet to update their device, they can fetch the software update from the Updates tab in the Mac App Store. The macOS Sierra 10.12.4 update is free to download, so users of MacOS Sierra-running devices are recommended to download and install the update right away. The main feature that this update brings is Night Shift, which was previously limited to iOS devices only, as pointed out by Apple Insider.  Night Shift is designed to make changes to the display settings of the device at night and restore the original settings in the morning. Apple created this feature after learning that different lighting from computer screens affects the sleeping patterns of users. To ensure that users fall asleep and stay asleep for the right amount of time, Night Shift switches the display to a more yellow tone instead of the blue light that is known to have an effect on the circadian rhythm.  Night Shift is not an application; it is an operating system feature. But in order for it to work, Mac users should first activate it. Before doing so, owners must understand that not all Mac devices are capable of supporting this feature. As such, not everyone can have access to Night Shift. According to MacRumors, only Mac devices released in 2012 and the newer-generation devices are compatible with Night Shift. Older devices will never work with this feature.  To activate Night Shift, one should head to System Preferences. From there, one should look for the Display menu. With the update, this menu now shows three tabs: Display, Color and Night Shift. When choosing Night Shift, the system would then ask for the user to choose the schedule for the feature to automatically turn on.  Once can choose either “Sunset to Sunrise” or “Custom.” Selecting the former requires the device to identify one’s location, so the option to do so should be enabled in Security & Privacy Preferences. In selecting Custom, one will have to encode the specific start and end time for Night Shift.  There is also a manual option a user could tick to enable Night Shift to remain on until the next day. Also found on the Night Shift settings is a note that the feature does not apply to connected devices like televisions and projectors. Lastly, users can modify the color temperature of the display by adjusting the tuner to Less Warm or More Warm, depending on their preference. Apple has included a warning that says, “Warmer settings may affect the appearance of some onscreen motion.” There are also other ways to manually switch Night Shift on and off. One can head to the Notification Center menu bar icon to launch the Today view. Updated devices will now show a toggle for Night Shift. Switching the mode on and off using this toggle is as easy as swiping it from left to right and vice versa. If this is still much of a hassle to the user, the best way to activate Night Shift is by asking Siri to do so. After clicking the Siri button, the commands “Turn on Night Shift” and “Turn off Night Shift” would suffice in enabling and disabling this new display mode. Apple is rolling out macOS Sierra 10.12.4 that comes with Night Shift mode.

After launching iOS 10 last September, Apple was relatively quick to follow up with iOS 10.1 in October and iOS 10.2 in December, but it ended up taking more than three months to finalize iOS 10.3. Don't Miss: Bloomberg: Apple is working on multiple exciting new AR features for the iPhone 8 Thankfully, the latest update is packed with new features and fixes that should make it worth the wait. Along with bringing the frequently discussed Find My AirPods functionality to the Find My iPhone app, iOS 10.3 also changes the animations that occur when opening and closing apps, adds weather forecasts to the Maps app and gives users the option to add a Podcasts widget in the panel where widgets go. You can read more about these features and other features coming in iOS 10.3 right here. These might not be as exciting to the average consumer as the new emoji or the dedicated TV app that arrived alongside iOS 10.2, but they will make iOS a better, faster platform for current and future iPhones and iPads. It’s also worth noting that 9.3 was the final numbered release of the iOS 9 era, so unless something changes this generation, we likely won’t see anything more than bug fixes and the like from here on out. If you want to update your iOS device to iOS 10.2 immediately, you can do so by heading to Settings > General > Software Update and tapping “Download and Install” at the bottom of the page. As always, you can also apply the update through iTunes, though, fair warning, that does require you to use iTunes.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google Android inventor Andy Rubin offers peek of new smartphone said to be iPhone rival By Ethan Baron / March 27, 2017 at 2:44 PM To build a smartphone to take on the iPhone and high-end Android devices, it would be nice to have an office full of former Apple and Google engineers. Check. And it certainly would be helpful to have invented software for a smartphone operating system yourself. Check. Having spent time as a powerful executive at one of the firms targeted for disruption would also be an asset. Check. Then you might want to drum up some hype. Check. It’s been about 2 1/2 months since a report suggested that Android inventor and former high-profile Google executive Andy Rubin was starting up a hardware company, to be built around a flagship phone. “Armed with about a 40-person team, filled with recruits from Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Rubin is preparing to announce a new company called Essential and serve as its chief executive officer,” Bloomberg reported Jan. 13, citing anonymous sources. The “centerpiece” for a planned lineup of Essential products would be a phone “with a large edge-to-edge screen that lacks a surrounding bezel,” according to Bloomberg. Rubin left his senior vice-president position at Google in November 2014 after nearly a decade with the company. In November 2015 he registered Essential Products, Inc. with California regulators and late last year the firm registered “Essential” with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, naming smartphones, tablets and operating software for mobile phones as products, Bloomberg said. “While still in the prototyping stage, Rubin’s phone is aimed at the top of the market where Apple Inc.’s iPhone and Alphabet Inc.’s new Pixel reside,” the news outlet reported. Rubin, who co-created Android software, sold Android to Google in 2005 and then led transformation of the software into the most prevalent smartphone operating system on the planet. He had reportedly suffered a blow earlier this year when SoftBank pulled out of a planned $100 million investment in Essential “partly because of the Japanese investor’s increasingly close relationship with Apple,” the Wall Street Journal reported (paywall). But if a tantalizing tweet from Rubin on March 27 is any indication, loss of the planned SoftBank funding didn’t kill Essential or its phone. “I’m really excited about how this is shaping up,” Rubin tweeted above a photo of a phone mostly covered up by a hand. “Eager to get it in more people’s hands… ” In the photo, only a corner of the phone is shown. It appears to possess a very narrow bezel, although it’s possible that what appears to be a bezel in the photo is an external protector. Rubin’s tweet quickly drew worldwide attention, from the tech press to the Daily Mail. That online newspaper’s coverage is noteworthy for a sidebar showing, apparently, Rubin’s dog barking at a Google robot. The phone is expected to hit the market around the middle of this year and cost about as much as an iPhone 7, Bloomberg reported, suggesting a retail price of $649.

Specifically, Rolland suggests the 2017 Apple Watch will include a SIM card for LTE connectivity and that the next-generation device will be promoted alongside the AirPods. We understand a model of the next Apple watch will include a SIM card, and therefore is likely to support LTE. We understand some issues remain, including battery life and form factor size, but significant progress has been made. Apple may be employing VOIP and data across a CAT-M1 connection for superior battery life. Apple will tout interoperability with the company's AirPods (now on back order till May) to make and receive phone calls (perhaps a small win for Maxim with amps in each ear bud). Positive QCOM, MXIM.Apple has likely been working to add a cellular modem to the Apple Watch for several years, but has been unable to do so due to excessive battery drain. In early 2016, rumors suggested the second-generation Apple Watch would include cellular connectivity, but that didn't pan out. Mid-2016 rumors indicated Apple was researching low-power cellular chips for future versions of the Apple Watch, but was unable to make it work for the second-generation device, so the technology could potentially be ready for inclusion in a 2017 Apple Watch. The addition of standalone cellular connectivity would further untether the Apple Watch from the iPhone, a process that started with the introduction of GPS in the Apple Watch Series 2. With a cellular connection, Apple Watch owners would not need an iPhone nearby to do things like make phone calls and stream Apple Music content, but a separate data plan would likely be needed. Other Apple Watch 3 rumors have pointed towards a modest update that focuses mainly on under-the-hood hardware improvements to boost performance and battery life, and while we haven't heard much information on a third-generation device, a refresh could come alongside the iPhone 8 in September. Today's report from Rolland also touches on some previously mentioned 2017 rumors, suggesting all three rumored iPhone models will feature wireless charging capabilities and will be charged through pads manufactured by Pegatron and Foxconn. "There is some skepticism regarding charging efficiency," writes Rolland, "as it may take 3 hours to receive a full charge." While long-range contactless wireless charging was originally rumored to be included in the 2017 iPhone, later information has centered on inductive charging methods, which would require a separate charging mat or other similar charging device. The analyst also believes Apple will eliminate the Home button in the iPhone 8, but the Lightning port will stay. He suggests there has been "serious consideration" for removing the Lightning port in 2018, however. Rolland does not have an established track record for predicting Apple's product plans, but the information he's shared today is not outlandish and echoes past rumors. Still, cellular connectivity for the Apple Watch has been rumored multiple times in the past, so it's worth viewing today's note with some skepticism until additional information is available.

While there may have been consideration for removing the Lightning connector, some form of physical connector would have to stay if they made the move in the future, likely some sort of smart connector. Rating: 9 Votes Mac 128 20 hours ago at 05:09 pm For what reason would you want internet connectivity when doing active water sports?!! Let's say I'm waiting for an important phone call, or an e-mail or text, but otherwise I'm free during the day. So instead of sitting by the phone all day, I can go out and have a nice surf session while the waves are in peak form. If the information I was waiting on comes in, then I'm notified, can paddle in and attend to business. Or I can swim laps while waiting, and thus don't have to miss a workout. This is the single most important thing about the iPhone too, yet I can't take the iPhone everywhere. I can take the watch. For those of us who get it, it is a god-send. For those who don't, turn it off, or buy the non-cellular model. Simple. Rating: 7 Votes Mac 128 21 hours ago at 04:25 pm For what purpose? I see no point in adding it. If nothing else, it makes it totally independent from the iPhone, and opens it up to the entire smart watch marketplace. There's many reasons someone would want this, even if you don't see the need. The good news is, just like the iPad there will likely be a model with and without it, and you won't have to buy it if you don't want to. Those of us, who would love to have this kind of connectivity will be spending more and enjoying the experience.

Rating: 5 Votes nutmac 21 hours ago at 04:08 pm Apple Watch with cellular could be very useful for certain segment of users. * K-12: Perhaps not as young as K-3, but a smart watch with cellular could be (1) more cost effective than a smartphone, (2) accepted at wider number of schools (some won't allow it due to theft and conformity), (3) and seen as less distracting (far less games and other time wasting apps). * Laborers: Using a phone while performing certain types of work can be very challenging. * Athletes * Security Restrictions: Not having a camera can be a plus. Many government organizations, courts, and security sensitive companies forbid devices with a camera. As for having yet another plan to pay argument, many carriers offer inexpensive monthly plans (about $5/month).

Video Is Snapchat building the iPhone killer? A new report brings back the speculation that Apple is working on a pair of augmented reality glasses, and paints Facebook as a direct competitor. According to the Financial Times (note: this article is behind a paywall), Apple and Facebook have stepped up their efforts to develop augmented reality glasses. Previously, Apple’s AR efforts were linked to the iPhone, and Facebook seemed occupied with the virtual reality capabilities of Oculus. Now, both tech giants are eager to create an AR wearable, according to the report. But don’t hold your breath. Even though Apple is rumored to have been working on AR glasses for over a year, they won’t arrive until at least 2018, the Financial Times reports. Meanwhile, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg has stated that his vision for AR glasses could take up to ten years to perfect. The goal is to make AR glasses small enough to take anywhere. “The goal is to make VR and AR what we all want it to be: glasses small enough to take anywhere, software that lets you experience anything, and technology that lets you interact with the virtual world just like you do with the physical one,” Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook in February after visiting the Oculus research lab. Why this matters: Apple and Facebook certainly aren’t the only tech companies interested in dominating the future of augmented reality. Microsoft seems way ahead in this department, given that a developer version of HoloLens has been available for a year. Not to mention, Snapchat’s parent company, Snap, could integrate AR capabilities in the next version of Spectacles. There are also a few startups getting into the space. Both Magic Leap and Meta are expected to unveil their take on AR glasses this year. Magic Leap has received funding from Google, and Meta once had an advisor in Mike Rockwell, who is now the head of Apple’s AR projects.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Announcement  ⋮  Mobile iPhone 7 & 7 Plus Special Edition (PRODUCT)RED Plus New 2017 iPad Available to Purchase By Omar Sohail Mar 24, 2017 12Shares Share Tweet Submit The Apple Store was earlier down for maintenance which can only mean that the company is getting ready to stock up its latest lineup of mobile devices that it announced earlier. In case you forgot, they were the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Special Edition (PRODUCT)RED along with the new, and might we add, affordable 2017 iPad. You Can Now Buy the New iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus Models With 128GB Storage Offered as the Lowest Capacity – iPad Models Have Been Stocked Too Apple states that for every iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus Special Edition (PRODUCT)RED model sold, a small amount will go to the contribution of removing the element of AIDS from the environment. It is definitely a nice gesture from the company, and if you want to own the latest edition color models, there is a small premium that you will have to pay. The company has not included the 32GB storage models in this color variant; instead, you will either have to purchase the 128 or 256GB storage model.

The remaining hardware specifications of both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are going to remain the same. As for the new 9.7-inch 2017 iPad, it happens to be the most affordable tablet from Apple that you can purchase right now and comes in the 32 and 128GB storage flavors. Advertisement There is nothing earth-shattering about the slate that we haven’t seen before, other than the fact that its affordable price tag in comparison to other models will make it a great purchase for those who want decent performance without shelling too much money. The new 9.7-inch iPad features Apple’s A9 chipset coupled with a Touch ID sensor that can be used to authenticate payments. Apple states that you can get around 10 hours of battery life on a single charge, which should make the product a great addition for media consumption. Related T-Mobile’s JUMP!

Email | 27 Mar 2017 | Print  ExtraBITS for 27 March 2017 by TidBITS Staff In ExtraBITS this week, Apple has announced (but not released) Clips, a new social photo and video app, and the U.S. and UK have both banned large carry-on electronics from flights originating from several African and Middle Eastern countries. Apple to Release Clips, a Free Social Photo and Video App -- Apple has announced that it will soon release Clips, a new social-focused photography and video app. The free Clips app will take square photos and videos that are ideal for most social networks, and it will offer fun features like titles, filters, and overlays. Apple gave Lauren Goode of the Verge early access, and she has written a full review. It’s unclear why Apple is making Clips separate from the Camera app — perhaps the company plans to field test new features in Clips before migrating the most popular to Camera? Or perhaps it’s meant as a precursor to an augmented reality app? Or maybe it’s just the latest incarnation of Photo Booth? We hope more becomes clear when Clips ships in April 2017. Read/post comments Large Electronics Banned on Some International Flights to the U.S. and UK -- The United States and United Kingdom have banned nearly all electronics larger than a phone from flights originating from several African and Middle Eastern countries. The ban will include carry-on laptops, tablets, electronic book readers, and cameras, but those devices will still be allowed in checked baggage. A U.S. Department of Homeland Security official told the BBC that the ban was based on “evaluated intelligence,” likely related to reports that Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is trying to build bombs with little or no metal content to target commercial aircraft.

Email | 27 Mar 2017 | Print  TidBITS Watchlist: Notable Software Updates for 27 March 2017 by TidBITS Staff iTunes 12.6 -- Apple has issued iTunes 12.6 in conjunction with the release of the new iPad (“Apple Replaces iPad Air 2 with New 9.7-inch iPad,” 21 March 2017) and iPhones (see “Apple Introduces (PRODUCT)RED iPhones, Doubles iPhone SE Storage,” 21 March 2017) with a feature that’s long been requested — the capability to watch iTunes movie rentals on any of your Apple devices. The feature also requires iOS 10.3 or tvOS 10.2, both of which have just been released (see “iOS 10.3 Adds New File System, Find My AirPods, Other Major Refinements,” 27 March 2017, and “Apple Releases macOS 10.12.4, watchOS 3.2, and tvOS 10.2,” 27 March 2017). Dubbed “rent once, watch anywhere,” the feature enables you to start watching a movie on your Apple TV at home and then finish it on your next morning’s bus commute by streaming it on your iPhone. Previously, you could transfer rentals made on your Mac to an iOS device by performing a sync, and you couldn’t access rentals made on an Apple TV on any other devices. Other changes in iTunes 12.6 include the capability to open playlists in their own windows and a redesign of the MiniPlayer. (Free, 269 MB via direct download or Software Update, release notes, 10.9.5+) Read/post comments about iTunes 12.6. EagleFiler 1.7.5 -- C-Command Software has released EagleFiler 1.7.5, ensuring that the New Browser Window command makes a new window for better consistency with the Finder. Additionally, the document organization and archiving app tweaks the behavior of the Command-Up Arrow and Command-Down Arrow keyboard shortcuts so that they no longer change the selection in the records list when their corresponding menu commands (Enclosing Record and Contents of Record) are disabled. The update also no longer tries to import metadata files for Dropbox’s Selective Sync feature, partially works around a bug in macOS 10.12 Sierra that could prevent text from being indexed properly (though you will need to rebuild indexes to see a change for existing records), improves error reporting when moving files, and makes some updates to documentation and the Help menu. ($40 new with a 20 percent discount for TidBITS members from C-Command Software or from the Mac App Store, free update, 18.0 MB, release notes, 10.6.8+) Read/post comments about EagleFiler 1.7.5. GraphicConverter 10.4 -- Lemkesoft has issued GraphicConverter 10.4 with added support for 32-bit-per-channel images (HDR), improved manual downloads, and new batch processes: Rename and Multiply Alpha Channel by Factor. The venerable graphic conversion and editing utility also adds an option to automatically add parent keywords in the Browser Keywords palette, adds import and export support for the EBM image format, resolves a possible crash with the Insert Text batch process, and updates Czech, French, Danish, Japanese, and Swedish localizations. ($39.95 new from Lemkesoft or the Mac App Store, free update, 125 MB, release notes, 10.8+) Read/post comments about GraphicConverter 10.4. HoudahGeo 5.1.8 -- Houdah Software has released HoudahGeo 5.1.8, improving the performance of the photo geotagging app when loading a large Photos library. The update also works around a problem with malformed GPS data written by some Nikon cameras and resolves an issue with downloading GPS track logs from Garmin devices. ($39 new with a 25 percent discount for TidBITS members, free update, 21.7 MB, release notes, 10.11.5+) Read/post comments about HoudahGeo 5.1.8. PopChar X 7.7 -- Ergonis Software has issued PopChar X 7.7, the final scheduled maintenance release for PopChar 7 before Ergonis releases version 8 later this year. The character discovery utility now adjusts metrics for eight new fonts (particularly Google’s Noto fonts), extends diagnostic information for email support, resolves a potential crash related to the construction of the layout menu, fixes a problem with an incorrect display of certain combining marks (such as vowel signs), improves the removal of relics from previous updates, and reduces network traffic when checking for updates. (€29.99 new with a 25 percent discount for TidBITS members, free update, 4.6 MB, release notes, 10.6+) Read/post comments about PopChar X 7.7. Default Folder X 5.1.4 -- St. Clair Software has released Default Folder X 5.1.4 to fix issues that should improve reliability for the Open/Save dialog enhancement utility. Default Folder X now copies tags to its own tag field below the Save dialog and includes commands to remove or edit the current default folder in the Favorites menu. The release also fixes a memory leak caused by opening a file dialog and then closing it quickly, corrects an issue that caused the app to stop functioning when selecting a new original for a Finder alias, and works around a Spotlight bug that could cause a crash. ($34.95 new, TidBITS members save $10 on new copies and $5 on upgrades, 6.4 MB, release notes, 10.10+) Read/post comments about Default Folder X 5.1.4.   TextExpander: Communicate smarter.

Find My AirPods makes it easier to keep track of the Apple AirPods wireless earphones. It works with AirPods that are connected to an iOS device via Bluetooth, meaning it can only locate AirPods that are nearby, but if your AirPods were lost out of range of an iPhone, it does offer up some location clues. Here's everything you need to know, including how the feature works and its limitations. Apple AirPods firmware update: How to check install latest version How to turn on Apple's Night Shift mode and adjust the colour on Macs How does Find My AirPods work? Find My iPhone app If you haven't already, download the Find My iPhone app on your iOS device, or locate the feature from iCloud.com. Find My AirPods is a new function within Find My iPhone. If your AirPods are not in their case but are connected to an iPhone, they will appear on the Find My iPhone map (just like an iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, or Mac). If your AirPods haven't been used recently, they'll be marked "offline". Locating lost AirPods (nearby) If you have misplaced your AirPods somewhere nearby, Find My AirPods can locate it by playing a chirping sound that gets louder. Open Find My iPhone on an iOS device (or from iCloud.com). Tap AirPods in the list. Tap Actions. Tap Play Sound. If only one AirPod is missing, you can mute the sound coming from the AirPod you haven't lost. To stop the sound once the AirPods are found, tap Stop Playing.  Locating lost AirPods (far away) If your AirPods aren't connected to your iPhone, they cannot play a sound. But you can still use Find My AirPods to figure out their last-known location. The last place they were connected to an iPhone over Bluetooth will be displayed in the Find My iPhone app. Just tap the little car icon to get Apple Maps directions for the last-known location. Is that it? Just remember your AirPods cannot play the chirping sound while they're in the case. Also, Apple does offer AirPods replacements if one is lost and can't be found. It costs $69 to replace a single AirPod or to replace the AirPods Charging Case. Sections Apple Apps What is Google Assistant, how does it work, and which devices offer it?

It brings more than a dozen improvements and new features, such as Find My AirPods, Apple File System, a revamped iCloud section in Settings, a kill-switch for in-app review prompts, a name-and-shame list of legacy apps on your device and much more. Be sure to watch our video overview of everything new in iOS 10.3, then share your thoughts about your favorite features with fellow readers in the comment section. iOS 10.3 video hands-on Our own Andrew O’Hara put together a nice video walkthrough for you guys to enjoy. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube Your overview of iOS 10.3 features continues right below. iOS 10.3 highlights iOS 10.3 brings several new outward-facing features along with bug fixes, performance improvements and security enhancements. Some of the more notable changes include: Apple File System iCloud Analytics opt-in feature Revamped iCloud section, now at the top of the Settings app Siri and CarPlay improvements Reduce Motion for websites Settings toggle to disable in-app ratings and reviews Hourly forecast in Maps Navigation improvements for Mail’s Conversation View Easier typing on Chinese and Japanese keyboards Find My AirPods lets you locate a misplaced earbud in the Find My iPhone app. Not only does the app let you view the last known location of your AirPods on a map, it also makes it possible to play a high pitch sound to either or both AirPods. This is helpful for locating earbuds misplaced nearby (within Bluetooth range). Siri’s gotten smarter, too. On iOS 10.3, Siri can be asked to pay your bills using payment apps and check the status of your payment. She can also schedule a ride in Uber and other compatible apps. If you’re into sports, Siri will now check scores and statistics for Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council. And if you happen to use automaker apps, Siri in iOS 10.3 allows you to check your car’s fuel level, turn on the lights and activate the horn simply by asking. With iOS 10.3, developers can respond to reviews on App Store directly and publicly for everyone to see. Apple will soon enable a new toggle in Settings for disabling prompts in apps that inundate you with requests to rate it or post a review on App Store. Switching it to the OFF position will prevent apps from asking for product feedback. This switch only effects apps that use Apple’s new Reviews API. The ability for developers to respond to App Store reviews and for users to disable in-app review prompts will work on both App Store and Mac App Store. A new App Compatibility section in Settings lists legacy 32-bit apps. After launching a 32-bit app, iOS 10.3 pulls up a reworded prompt to inform you that 32-bit apps won’t work with future versions of iOS unless they have been updated (you can take that as proof that iOS 11 will be 64-bit only). The root-level iCloud section in the Settings app has been relocated to the top of the list and now appears as a neatly unified view bringing your Apple ID account information, settings and devices into one easily manageable section. CarPlay’s Maps app now supports ChargePoint electric vehicle stations, a feature that originally debuted in Apple Maps for iPhone and iPad in December 2016. Speaking of CarPlay, you can now quickly get to your recently used apps without going back to the Home screen as the CarPlay interface now provides quick shortcuts at the lefthand side for launching your favorite music, navigation and messaging apps. In iOS 10.3 Maps, you can press the displayed current temperature with 3D Touch to bring up the hourly forecast, or press harder to show detailed weather for this location in the stock Weather app. Oh, and Maps lets you search for “parked car” to see where you parked your vehicle. In Calendar, you can report spam. This feature originally launched in Calendar for iCloud in November 2016 and now it’s available across your iOS devices as well. The Podcasts app now has a Today widget, supports 3D Touch for one-tap access to the recently enjoyed shows and lets you share podcast episodes via Messages. In the Home app, you can now see the battery level status for your HomeKit-certified accessories and trigger scenes which use smart home products that are outfitted with switches and buttons. iOS 10.3 also allows third-party apps to update their icon without requiring developers to submit a new binary to App Store. Developers can use this feature to reflect various states in their apps on your Home screen. For example, a free app could update its icon after you upgrade to the full version via the In-App Purchase mechanism. Last but not least,  iOS 10.3 (as well as macOS Sierra 10.12.4, watchOS 3.2 and tvOS 10.2) comes with the new Apple File System designed to help free up storage space, improve performance and make your data more secure. It’s optimized for flash-based storage (but works with traditional hard disk drives as well), scales from Apple Watch to Mac Pro and has encryption built-in. Here are three key benefits of Apple File System vs. HFS+: Encryption—Encryption is supported natively and extends to file meta data Copy-on-write metadata—Ensures crash-safe updates to the file system Space sharing—Multiple file systems share the same underlying free space on a physical volume, not a fixed amount of space for each file system For the technically inclined, other features of Apple File System include: Extended file attributes TRIM operations Cloning for files and directories Snapshots Fast directory sizing Atomic safe-save primitives 1 nanosecond timestamp granularity Improved file system fundamentals Existing third party utilities will need to be updated to support the new file system. The Apple File System Guide provides more information. iOS 10.3 changelog Apple mentions the following improvements in the official iOS 10.3 changelog: Find My iPhone View the current or last known location of your AirPods Play a sound on one or both AirPods to help you find them Siri Support for paying and checking status of bills with payment apps Support for scheduling with ride booking apps Support for checking car fuel level, lock status, turning on lights and activating horn with automaker apps Cricket sports scores and statistics for Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council CarPlay Shortcuts in the status bar for easy access to last used apps Apple Music Now Playing screen gives access to Up Next and the currently playing song’s album Daily curated playlists and new music categories in Apple Music Other improvements and fixes Rent once and watch your iTunes movies across your devices New Settings unified view for your Apple ID account information, settings and devices Hourly weather in Maps using 3D Touch on the displayed current temperature Support for searching “parked car” in Maps Calendar adds the ability to delete an unwanted invite and report it as junk Home app support to trigger scenes using accessories with switches and buttons Home app support for accessory battery level status Podcasts support for 3D Touch and Today widget to access recently updated shows Podcast shows or episodes are shareable to Messages with full playback support Fixes an issue that could prevent Maps from displaying your current location after resetting Location & Privacy VoiceOver stability improvements for Phone, Safari and Mail For information on iOS 10.3’s security content, read Apple’s support doc. Your thoughts on iOS 10.3? We’re unlikely to see iOS 10.4 because Apple will preview iOS 11 and other platform and OS updates at its worldwide developers conference in June.

Christopher Rolland of Susquehanna Financial Group met with various suppliers and tech companies in Asia, including Broadcom and Qualcomm, learning a lot about what’s in the pipeline for Apple and its devices… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Among other things, one of the most common Apple Watch rumors is the addition of LTE connectivity. The rumor makes the rounds every year and yet again, it’s in the mix for the Apple Watch Series 3. During his trip to Asia, Rolland said that he heard from several parties that the upcoming Apple Watch will include a SIM card and will support LTE. To combat battery concerns, Apple is allegedly considering a low-power CAT-M1 chip for LTE connectivity and plans to implement VOIP technology. We understand a model of the next Apple watch will include a SIM card, and therefore is likely to support LTE. We understand some issues remain, including battery life and form factor size, but significant progress has been made. Apple may be employing VOIP and data across a CAT-M1 connection for superior battery life. Apple will tout interoperability with the company’s AirPods. Furthermore, Rolland offers up some additional iPhone tidbits following his time in Asia. First and foremost, he claims that all three of the upcoming iPhones will support wireless inductive charging, with Pegatron and Foxconn manufacturing the transmit pads. While there has been some discrepancy as to what iPhones will adopt wireless charging, Rolland’s findings corroborate the most recent KGI thoughts. Rolland also says that Apple has apparently been facing technology hurdles when it comes to dropping the Home button: We understand there are three versions: 4.7” iPhone7s, 5.5” iPhone7s Plus and 5.8” OLED iPhone 8 with all three versions offering wireless charging (AVGO). Pegatron and Foxconn will manufacture the transmit pads. However, there is some skepticism regarding charging efficiency as it may take 3 hours to receive a full charge. While we do expect the elimination of the home button, some in the supply chain believe the spec may be in limbo as Apple has had some technical issues validating the technology. Finally, Rolland says that Apple suppliers are currently investigating a “hybrid” solution for charging. The solution is said to be a combination USB-C and Lightning, but it’s not expected to be implemented until next year. It’s unclear at this point what exactly this solution is, but the report comes as Apple was once rumored to adopt USB-C with this year’s iPhone, though that no longer appears to be the case. USB Type-C did not replace the lightning jack in this version, but is in serious consideration for next year’s model. Contacts believe Apple may be creating an interoperable hybrid that mixes the best of both technologies. One thing to note about these investor comments it that they are often speculative and based on ever-changing supplier environments. Nevertheless, they offer an interesting look as to what goes into the production of the iPhone.

This latest version, which comes on the same day as tvOS 10.2 and iOS 10.3, brings long-awaited iPad support to the table. Along with support for the iPad, the updated Apple TV Remote app features an enhanced Now Playing interface complete with support for lyrics and Up Next playlists for music, along with several other notable features. Have a look at our hands-on video walkthrough with the Apple TV Remote app inside. The best wireless keyboard for the Mac? Here is the official change log for Apple TV Remote 1.1: Support for iPad Enhanced Now Playing experience with lyrics and playlists for music and chapters, audio tracks and captions selection for movies and TV shows General performance and stability improvements We took a hands-on look at the initial version of the Apple TV Remote app when it was released in beta back in June. That version was nice, but iPad support was conspicuously missing. Today we take a hands-on look at version 1.1, which features iPad support in tow. Video walkthrough Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more hands-on videos Unfortunately one of my main complaints about the initial Apple TV Remote app release — the lack of software volume controls — has yet to be addressed. I understand that the hardware version of the remote utilizes its built in IR blaster to communicate with a television, but it would be nice if there was a software provision for adjusting volume via the app. Be sure to watch our previous hands-on video (embedded below) for more overall details on what the app has to offer.

Designed to replace the iPad Air, the iPad comes with a tantalizingly low price tag: $329. It is Apple's most affordable tablet to date and it's a competitive price point that will allow the iPad to better compete with lower-priced Android offerings. What do you get for $329? As it turns out, quite a lot. The iPad is a little bit iPhone 6s, a little bit iPad Air, and a little bit iPad Air 2. In a nutshell, compared to the iPad Air 2, the iPad has a brighter display and a faster A9 processor (first introduced in the iPhone 6s). Other internal hardware seems to be very similar to what's included in the iPad Air 2, with the exception of the display and the casing. Camera, battery life, Wi-Fi, LTE, and other sensors are all nearly the same. The iPad does not include a laminated display, and is thus thicker, much like the original iPad Air. It measures in at 7.5mm thick, compared to the 6.1mm iPad Air 2. The thickness and accompanying weight discrepancy is noticeable and the one downside between the new iPad and its predecessor. Compared to the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, the new iPad is, of course, significantly inferior, which is why it's priced at $329 and not $599. It does not support the Apple Pencil or the Smart Keyboard (no Smart Connector), and it lacks many of the display improvements, including True Tone color shifting and wide color gamut. The iPad has a slower processor than the iPad Pro, an inferior camera (8-megapixel vs. 12-megapixel rear and 1.2-megapixel vs. 5-megapixel front), two speakers instead of four, a slower LTE modem, and of course, since the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is the same size as the iPad Air 2, the iPad is noticeably thicker and heavier. If you're looking for top of the line hardware and accessory support, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is the tablet to buy, but if you don't need the bells and whistles, the iPad is a steal at its price point. Performance wise, it's going to run all the latest games and apps, it'll take decent pictures, it still has a high-quality Retina display, and it features a 10 hour battery life, so it will hold up for several years, especially when doing basic tasks like web browsing and emailing. Click for larger version For those looking for a bit more, Apple is rumored to be planning to introduce an updated ~10-inch iPad Pro model that's going to replace the existing 9.7-inch iPad Pro. The ~10-inch model is said to have smaller bezels and perhaps an edge-to-edge display, allowing it to feature a bigger screen in a 9.7-inch-sized body. That tablet was originally rumored to be coming in the spring, but now it's looking like we won't see it until later in the year. Based on rumors, it may be worth the wait for those willing to shell out more money for the best technology. Apple plans to start selling the new iPad on Friday, March 24. The entry-level 32GB Wi-Fi only model will be priced at $329, and a 128GB model is available for $429. Wi-Fi + Cellular models are available at a $130 premium, so $459 for 32GB and $559 for 128GB.

Ditch the Air, but the thickness doesn't provide us with let's say more battery life or other advantages. Why not keep it as thin then? Just because we don't want a thin MBP and full functionality on these laptops doesn't mean they have to reverse the iPad?!? Seems like keeping the price down drove most of the design decisions here. I'm guessing the laminated display was too pricy. Rating: 13 Votes Hibbidyhai 6 days ago at 01:34 pm Apple seems a little confused right now.

The 'Air' moniker is outdated and no longer in line with the rest of their products. An iPad Mini, iPad, and iPad Pro lineup is logical. While the 'new' iPad is thicker than the iPad Air 2 its replacing, its the same size the original iPad Air. They just need to apply this to the rest of their product lineup. The Macbook Air no longer makes sense when the Macbook is lighter and smaller. You can criticize their individual products, but I think ditching the 'Air' name makes too much sense.

Apple isn't about pleasing one loser on one forum. It's about making something the masses like. That's pretty much business 101. Anyways, not really shocking that people are complaining about this pretty awesome product. People complain about the "Apple Tax" - Apple releases a very nice entry tablet for a cheaper price, people complain about features. Yea specs are gonna cost you sweetheart. People complain about Apple making devices thinner - Apple releases a thicker device, people complain. Err mur gawd its heavier how am I Gonna use this ****? I like thin devices now!!!!!

It's useful in situations where the bright screen can be a distraction, such as a movie or a play, and it's also useful for those who like to sleep with their Apple Watches. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. Activating Theater Mode Theater Mode is available as an option in the Apple Watch Control Center, so toggling it on and off is simple. Raise your wrist to activate the Apple Watch screen or press the Digital Crown. Swipe up from the bottom of the Apple Watch to bring up Control Center. Swipe up again to access the icon that looks like a pair of theater masks. Tap the masks. A screen will pop up explaining theater mode. Tap again to activate it. While Theater Mode is active, you'll see an the icon at the top of the Apple Watch whenever you view the screen. To turn it off, open up the Control Center again and tap the Theater Mode button. How Theater Mode Works When Theater Mode is enabled, the screen will remain dark when you raise your wrist instead of lighting up. It will also stay dark when a notification is received, but you'll still know if you get an incoming text or other alert because haptic feedback remains on. Accessing Notifications While Theater Mode is On You'll continue to get a tap whenever there's an incoming notification when Theater Mode is turned on, and to view it, you'll need to press the Digital Crown or tap on the screen. Tapping, pressing the Digital Crown, or pressing the side button is also how you check the time when Theater Mode is enabled.

The Apple boss probably does now. Duan is the reclusive billionaire who founded Oppo and Vivo, the twin smartphone brands that dealt the world's largest company a stinging defeat in China last year. Once derided as cheap iPhone knock-offs, they leapfrogged the rankings and shoved Apple out of the top three in 2016 — when iPhone shipments fell in China for the first time. They managed to do it because the American smartphone giant didn't adapt to local competition, the entrepreneur told Bloomberg. Oppo and Vivo employed tactics Apple was reluctant to match, such as cheaper devices with high-end features, for fear of jeopardizing its winning formula elsewhere, Duan said. "Apple couldn't beat us in China because even they have flaws," the 56-year-old electronics mogul said. "They're maybe too stubborn sometimes. They made a lot of great things, like their operating system, but we surpass them in other areas." That's not to say Duan doesn't appreciate the iPhone maker's global clout. In fact, the billionaire's obsession with his U.S. rival is well known: he's long been a big-time investor in Apple and an unabashed fan of its chief executive officer. "I've met Tim Cook on several occasions. He might not know me but we've chatted a little," Duan said. "I like him a lot." In a 2015 blog post, he argued Apple's profit should reach $100 billion within five years. Today, Duan won't say when he actually bought in but says much of his overseas wealth remains tied up in the iPhone maker. He even lives in Palo Alto, an easy drive from Apple's new UFO-like headquarters in Cupertino. "Apple is an extraordinary company. It is a model for us to learn from," Duan said. "We don't have the concept of surpassing anyone, the focus instead is to improve ourselves." Oppo's gains against Apple may now earn an even broader following for the billionaire dubbed China's Warren Buffett by local media for his investment acumen. Born in Jiangxi, a birthplace of Mao Zedong's Communist revolution, Duan began his career at a state-run vacuum tube plant before making his name with homegrown electronics. Duan left the factory floor around 1990, when China was just embracing capitalism and opening industries to private investment. He headed to southern China's Guangdong province, then the cradle of liberal reforms, to run a struggling electronics plant. His first product was the "Subor" gaming console with dual-cartridge slots — a direct shot at Nintendo's classic Family Computer, known elsewhere as the Nintendo Entertainment System. It became a hit in the absence of local competitors. Duan left to set up a new business that year as the operation flourished — a pattern he would repeat in later years. He christened his second venture Bubugao, literally "rising higher step-by-step." BBK, as the company came to be known, created a popular line of VCD and MP3 players but later also made DVD players for global brands. Subsidiary Bubugao Communication Equipment became one of the country's biggest feature-phone makers around 2000, going head-to-head with Nokia and Motorola. It was the first iPhone in 2007 that paved the way for Oppo and Vivo. While they share a common founder in Duan, the sister brands are fierce competitors, trotting out dueling marketing campaigns in markets from India to Southeast Asia. Their salesmanship philosophy plays well in emerging markets, IDC research manager Kiranjeet Kaur said. "The companies fully understand how to make the best of their people, a specialty they inherited from Duan," said Nicole Peng, a senior director at Canalys. Importantly, they understood their millennial audience. Duan's latest endeavours were, in part, dreamed up in Apple's backyard. By 2001 at the age of 40, Duan had decided to move to California to focus on investment and philanthropy, later installing his family in a mansion he reportedly bought from Cisco Systems chair John Chambers. But the advent of the smartphone forced the entrepreneur out of retirement. By the second half of 2000s, BBK was on the verge of falling apart as sales of its basic devices slowed. The likes of Huawei and Coolpad were making smartphones priced at around 1,000 yuan. That nearly put the company under, Duan recalled. "We were in serious discussions about how to close the company peacefully — in a way that the employees can leave unhurt and suppliers don't lose money," he said. Those intense brainstorming sessions spawned the two businesses that would go on to embody Duan's greatest success. In 2005, the entrepreneur and his protege Tony Chen decided to create a new company. Dubbed Oppo, it sold music players but ramped up to smartphones in 2011. In 2009, BBK itself created Vivo, headed by another of Duan's disciples, Shen Wei. At first, neither label garnered much attention. The iPhone was captivating users with its revolutionary apps system and elegant interface, while BlackBerrys lorded over the corporate market. But Oppo and Vivo then developed a marketing-blitz approach that relied on local celebrity endorsement and a vast resellers' store network across China. They crafted an affordable image that appealed to a millennial crowd, then tricked out their devices with high-end specs. It paid off. The duo together shipped more than 147 million smartphones in China in 2016, dwarfing Huawei Technologies' 76.6 million units, Apple's 44.9 million and Xiaomi's 41.5 million, IDC estimates. Oppo and Vivo both doubled their 2015 haul. In the fourth quarter, they were No. 1 and No. 3, respectively — Huawei was second. | Latest News News Waterloo's Muslim prayer centre proposal met with 'unreasonable' opposition Snapshot Local Waterloo Region accused of ‘whitewashing’ history Snapshot Local Police release images of men in connection with break-ins at Wilson Avenue apartments Snapshot Local Grand River Transit workers split on contract, forcing both parties back to bargaining table Snapshot PHOTOS AND VIDEOS View All Photos View All Videos News St. Patrick's Day on Ezra Avenue News Shooting ArtsEntertainment PHOTOS: Grammy Awards red carpet Video Re-Enactment Video The Hot List: Top 10 cottage rental locations in Ontario Sponsored content Most Read SEE MORE Atlanta family battling state over right to name daughter Allah Teens barred from boarding flight for wearing leggings Six vehicles stolen from Kitchener dealership Dare Foods heiress in family feud loses court battle Long-delayed tax sale of former Electrohome site moving ahead In Your Neighbourhood Today Attic insulation should be the highest priority in a home retrofit When it comes to improving your home's efficiency, you probably think of retrofitting the most...

Last May, a Beijing patent regulator ordered Apple's Chinese subsidiary and a local retailer Zoomflight to stop selling the iPhones after Shenzhen Baili Marketing Services lodged a complaint, claiming that the patent for the design of its mobile phone 100c was being infringed by the iPhone sales. Apple and Zoomflight took the Beijing Intellectual Property Office's ban to court. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday revoked the ban, saying Apple and Zoomflight did not violate Shenzhen Baili's design patent for 100c phones. The court ruled that the regulator did not follow due procedures in ordering the ban while there was no sufficient proof to claim the designs constituted a violation of intellectual property rights. Representatives of Beijing Intellectual Property Office and Shenzhen Baili said they would take time to decide whether to appeal the ruling, according to Xinhua. In a related ruling, the same court denied a request by Apple to demand stripping Shenzhen Baili of its design patent for 100c phones. Apple first filed the request to the Patent Reexamination Board of State Intellectual Property Office. The board rejected the request, but Apple lodged a lawsuit against the rejection. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday ruled to maintain the board's decision. It is unclear if Apple will appeal.

Tech News | 20 Mar 2017 | Print  | Comment (15) 30 Conferences for Mac and iOS Professionals in 2017 by Adam C. Engst and Josh Centers Despite the loss of Macworld/iWorld, which many in the industry continue to mourn, there’s no shortage of Apple-focused conferences for professionals to gather with peers. We have once again collected details — or at least dates — for all the Apple-related conferences we can find; if we’ve missed any, let us know in the comments. We’ve sorted them by date so you can scroll through and see which might fit into your schedule. If you want to meet part of the TidBITS gang, Adam Engst will be at the ACEs Conference in May, and he and Tonya are likely to go to MacTech Conference in November. Josh Centers is planning to attend the iBooks Author Conference in October. If regular TidBITS contributors are asked to speak at any others, we’ll be sure to mention that in a future article. MacTech Pro: March–September 2017 -- A regional event series from the folks behind MacTech Conference, MacTech Pro is designed for professional Apple techs and consultants.

WWDC: June 5–9, 2017 -- Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference will take place at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, CA June 5th through 9th (see “WWDC 2017 Moves Back to San Jose on June 5th through 9th,” 16 February 2017). Registration opened 27 March 2017 at 10:00 AM PDT. As in previous years, tickets will be distributed by lottery to registered developers who wish to attend. Tickets cost $1599, but Apple offers scholarships for students that include lodging. A number of other events will be taking place alongside WWDC. Jim Dalrymple’s Beard Bash will offer free music and beer on 5 June 2017 at the City National Civic.

James Dempsey and the Breakpoints will be performing the night of 7 June 2017 at the City National Civic, with proceeds to benefit App Camp for Girls. If you can’t score a WWDC ticket, there are three adjoining conferences: AltConf, CocoaConf Next Door, and Layers.287.9925 AltConf: June 5-8 2017 -- AltConf is a free, community-driven event that takes place alongside WWDC, offering additional talks and events for those who weren’t lucky enough to get into WWDC or who want a break from the Apple Reality Distortion Field. While tickets are free, you can buy a “hero ticket” for $300 that guarantees entry. CocoaConf Next Door: June 5-8 2017 -- Taking place alongside WWDC — literally next door — CocoaConf Next Door is a four-day developer conference covering all things Swift, iOS and macOS. Early bird registration is $999 until 28 April 2017, when the full schedule is expected to be announced. Confirmed speakers are Jean MacDonald of App Camp for Girls, author Daniel Steinberg, author Rob Napier, and Khan Academy developer Laura Savino. Layers: June 5-7 2017 -- A conference for designers, Layers is described as “like a party, but for learning.” This three-day conference will take place at the Montgomery Theater, across from WWDC. Details have yet to be announced, but tickets cost $850 each.

Sessions are identified as being appropriate for beginners or intermediate users. FileMaker Developer Conference: July 24–27, 2017 -- This one’s pretty specific, but since the FileMaker Developer Conference is open to the public and FileMaker is an Apple subsidiary, we’re including it. It takes place from July 24th through 27th at the JW Marriott Phoenix Desert Ridge in Phoenix. Early bird registration is $999 until 28 April 2017 after which it goes up by $100.

Scheduled for October 16th through 18th in Chicago. Details about speakers, sessions, and registration prices aren’t yet available, but you can sign up to be alerted when they’re decided upon. Last year’s speakers included Christina Warren of Gizmodo, David Sparks of MacSparky, Stephen Hackett of Relay FM, Jaimee Newberry of MartianCraft, and Rich Siegel of Bare Bones Software.

Registration fees range from $499 to $1099, depending on when you sign up and if you’re in the education market. MacTech Conference: November 15–17, 2017 -- While the MacTech Pro events fit into a single day and travel around the country, the Los Angeles-based MacTech Conference offers attendees three days of sessions, seminars, and vendor interaction, plus pre-conference workshops and a pair of superlative evening activities. We’ve attended a number of times (see “MacTech Conference 2012 Opens Mental Doors,” 22 October 2012, “MacTech Conference 2013 Abounds with Networking and Fun,” 11 November 2013, and “Three Highlights from MacTech Conference 2015,” 9 November 2015) and recommend it to Apple IT professionals. It’s too early for there to be a list of speakers or sessions, but now is a good time to pencil MacTech Conference onto your calendar for November 15th through 17th, with pre-conference workshops on the 14th. Early bird tickets currently cost $949; the price will rise to $1599 eventually.

Reply Henry Larsen  2017-03-20 23:41 Sorry, but in this article you guys repeatedly set off a loud annoyance buzzer for me and, I expect, more than a few others. What's the problem? Well, here are a few examples: Mdevcon: ... Amsterdam, Netherlands IOSCon: ... London, England Don't all educated people (such as those who might be interested in attending a tech conference) know where Amsterdam is?!? (And it's 'the Netherlands' by the way.) If you mean Amsterdam, New York, then, OK, specify that. Otherwise the city name suffices. Likewise London. CocoaConf: ... Chicago, IL Is there even another Chicago, anywhere? App Builders Switzerland: ... Zürich, Switzerland Gosh, do you really think your readers are so stupid that they might think the App Builders _Switzerland_ conference is possibly in Zürich, Alabama? &c., &c., &c. Now, I understand that most of your readers are American and many observers have noted that Americans may be more geographically challenged than others -- but that's no reason to pander to them. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-21 09:06 From a publishing standpoint, we juggle completeness versus brevity all the time. For this article, we chose to be complete in terms of providing U.S. states or countries with the city name in most cases. I honestly wasn't paying that much attention to the place names this time around in favor of focusing on the dates and other details. Now that you point it out, it does look a little awkward, so I'll go through and trim out the obvious ones. I somehow doubt that most people know where Crystal Lake and State College are, so I'll leave those. Reply Richard Smith  2017-03-21 18:08 On that note, a consistency issue, you have the list mostly sorted by date, so I'm wondering why MacAdmins: July 11–14, 2017, is listed above X World: June 29–30, 2017.

Getty Images A hacker group called Turkish Crime Family says that it can access 250 million iCloud accounts, and will do so on April 7 to reset the password, locking people out of their accounts. They’ve even threatened to wipe people’s linked iPhones if Apple doesn’t pay up. And while it’s hard to tell how legitimate the threat is, their assertions make now as good a time to lock down your iCloud as ever. The group says it has seven members, and has requested $700,000 from Apple to stand down. It also may be planning a demonstration of what they can do prior to the deadline. “We have something planned soon before the attack,” a member of the group tells WIRED. RELATED: 7 Password Experts on How to Lock Down Your Online Security For its part, Apple says that the group doesn’t pose a threat. “There have not been any breaches in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud and Apple ID,” the company said in a statement. “The alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services. We’re actively monitoring to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and are working with law enforcement to identify the criminals involved.” And yet the claims merit some credence, as the hackers have demonstrated that they can access a small group of accounts. That’s not proof of broad iCloud access, though. It’s a common practice on today’s internet for hackers to comb through username and password combinations from older company data breaches, and find credential sets that still work on other services. If someone reused the same password across numerous sites and then never changed it, all of those accounts become vulnerable as the result of one breach. “If there was a breach or not, you’ll have to wait and see otherwise it is empty threats and just allegations,” says one of the hackers, which may be the best assessment of the situation yet. Just to be safe, here’s how to protect yourself in case something sinister really is brewing. Password Perfect First, change your password. Especially if it’s one that you also use on other accounts. A password manager can certainly help with this, but if you’d rather go the manual route there are some can’t-miss best practices you should deploy. You want to change your password to something that’s at least 12-15 characters, and the longer the better, even if it has fewer random characters in it. Also make it an obscure reference — no pet names, first street you lived on, or mother’s maiden name. The full name of your childhood imaginary friend that you’ve always been too embarrassed to tell anyone about could work. Bonus if that imaginary friend had an imaginary birthday and you can sprinkle the digits throughout. You get the idea. Now head to your Apple ID page, sign in, and click Change Password. Seriously, go ahead. I’ll wait here. But actually. Two-Factor Everything In Beyond changing your password, there’s another robust step you can take to protect your iCloud account from what hacks may come. By setting up Apple’s two-factor authentication you add an extra security protection to your account that will keep intruders out even if they do have your current password. (Legacy Apple devices that can’t facilitate two-factor authentication for Apple ID because they’re too old can still use Apple’s “two-step verification” protection). Turning on some type of second-factor authentication will protect you from whatever is going on in this Turkish Crime Family situation, along with all sorts of other types of potential attacks. RELATED: How to Use Instagram’s Two-Factor Authentication You can turn the feature on in the iCloud Settings/System Preferences tabs of iOS and macOS devices, or you can log into your AppleID account, scroll down to Security, and turn the service on under the Two-Factor Authentication section. From there, set up trusted — your iPhone and MacBook — that can receive the numeric codes that will act as the second authentication factor along with your password whenever you (or anyone) tries to log into your iCloud account from a new device. Without also having physical access to your trusted device, a hacker won’t be able to complete the login. Once you change your iCloud password to something strong and unique (which you already did, right?) and turn on two-factor authentication you should be good to go. Whether Turkish Crime Family is legit or full of it, you’ll have improved the security on an important and valuable account.

Here are five things to consider when turning customers into brand ambassadors: 1. What you offer must be worth raving about. First and foremost, the product or service you offer must be worth fans lining up to get their hands on. If not, there’s no way you’ll be able to turn customers into brand ambassadors—and it doesn’t matter how superior your customer service is. It sounds straightforward, but just think of the momentum Apple was able to build through its iPod and iPhone, despite neither one being the first MP3 player or touch-screen phone that existed at the time. It was through Apple’s superior design, user-friendliness, and the deep loyalty the company had already instilled in customers that led to long lines of customers all over the world wanting to be a part of the Apple movement. 2. Provide superior customer service that satisfies the customer-centric revolution. Sure, having an excellent product means you’ll be able to catch people’s attention, but the thrill of a new purchase rarely lasts long. What stays with the buyer way beyond the purchase is the way you make customers feel. What is it about your customer service that goes above and beyond? Do you treat each customer as if they’re individuals and do whatever you can to solve their problems or issues? Do you make efforts to maintain a relationship with them after the sale? Case in point is Zappos, a company widely known for providing the ultimate customer experience. When a best man’s shoes were delivered to the wrong address, a Zappos rep immediately sent a new pair via overnight delivery to the wedding location, set up the customer for a lifetime of free Zappos shipping, and refunded the entire purchase price. 3. Get to know your customers. Customers see themselves as distinct individuals and, consequently, also expect brands to see them as individuals. But the only way you can tell your customers apart from each another is by getting to know them well. Once you do that, you can communicate effectively with them and get the right messaging to the correct target audience. Consider using marketing automation to get to know, keep track of, and identify customers. Automation tools allow you to track what customers are buying, saying, and their purchasing behavior. Anytime you have an interaction with them, you will know exactly who they are because they’re in your system. Customers today know that businesses collect user information on them, but the bottom line is whether or not a business is using that information effectively. Have you identified customers who are sharing information and engaging with others on behalf of your company? If so, what have you done for them? Have you reached out so that they know you value their support? 4. Involve your fans. The more you interact with your clients, the more you’ll make them feel like their feedback is important to you. One way brands can make fans feel important is to bring them into the “inside” team by inviting them to try out new products and launches. When you involve your strongest supporters, you’re giving them an opportunity to refer and share news about your brand with their networks. This is a powerful marketing move that only the strongest brands truly understand. Case in point is Snapchat, which launched an initiative that allows users to turn their lives into an advertisement; as a result, millions of people became brand ambassadors overnight. When users snap a photo, they are able to imprint company names with taglines called “sponsored geofilters” which make it look users are in a company ad. For instance, during the holidays, when users took a photo or video near a big Christmas tree in certain cities, they were able to add a digital sticker of Hallmark’s latest ad campaign to share. Geofilters off a level of branding that target the right audience and, according to Snapchat, each campaign has garnered between 30 to 50 million views per day. 5. Make it worth their while. No matter how enthusiastic fans are about your brand, you need to make supporting your business worth their while. Show gratitude to your brand ambassadors with a personalized video message or an entry to a cool event. Sometimes, though, a simple positive reinforcement is sometimes all super fans expect. When you see them engaging with your content and interacting with their network about you, like and reply to their tweets, like and comment on their Facebook comments, and favorite and regram their Instagram posts. It takes a lot of work and commitment to turn fans into brand ambassadors, but once your customers feel very loyal to you, they’re no longer sensitive to price, and they believe that your brand adds intangible value to their life.

Just about the only question we have on this now is when they will decide that they’ve raised their price targets enough for it. At this point, many analysts have raised their price targets for Apple stock (AAPL) multiple times based solely on iPhone 8 rumors, although we may finally have one analyst who’s about to say enough’s enough. Photo by kropekk_pl (Pixabay) Apple stock (AAPL) added to Analyst Focus list In a research note dated March 26, JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall boosted his price for Apple stock (AAPL) from $142 to $165 and added it to his Analyst Focus List. He believes there is “high pent-up replacement demand heading into the 10th anniversary iPhone cycle this year.” He’s now estimating that Apple will sell 260 million iPhones in fiscal 2018, up from his previous projection of 245 million, based on a 48% replacement rate. He adds that his December quarter estimate is 86 million, compared to the consensus of around 80 million. Hall is convinced that the OLED display that’s rumored for the iPhone 8 is a go and believes that there is enough supply of the panels, something that’s been up for debate for a while. Others don’t believe there is enough manufacturing capacity to support an OLED-equipped iPhone, but Hall does fell there’s enough, although only for one model. He describes this year’s iPhone models as “compelling” and expects there to be an “iPhone Pro” featuring 3D facial recognition, a glass front and back, a “structured-light-augmented main camera, a larger screen in a smaller form factor than prior 5.5″ models” and wireless charging, all for a price of around $1,000. Hall also feels that Apple may have trouble keeping demand for this ultra-premium model within the range of what its suppliers is able to produce. A super strong iPhone 8 super cycle Nomura Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal boosted his price target for Apple stock (AAPL) in a research note on Friday, raising it significantly from $135 to $165 per share. He based his higher price target for Apple stock (AAPL) on his analysis of data from the App Store and fresh insight from his Asia Tour, which he said convinced him that the iPhone 8 cycle will be much bigger than what consensus estimates currently suggest. He noted that the iOS user base is more than 60% larger now than it was before the iPhone 6 launch, according to Sensor Tower. He estimates that there will be almost 665 million iPhones in use before the 8 launches later this year, compared to about 400 million going into the iPhone 6 cycle. Based on these numbers, he feels the size of the user base makes the current 239 million iPhone unit consensus for fiscal 2018 look “meager.” “Be careful” with Apple stock Today we finally have an analyst who’s starting to become concerned about Apple stock (AAPL) and expectations for this year’s anniversary edition iPhone. In a note dated March 27, FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi reiterated his Outperform rating and $155 price target on Apple stock (AAPL). However, he also advised investors to “be careful” because he feels that the stock is “getting more concerning.” Among the concerns he highlighted were China, India, maturity of the smartphone market, and falling gross margins for the iPhone. He pointed to the growing pile of glowing remarks on Apple stock (AAPL) based on expectations for the iPhone 8 “supercycle,” growth in services revenue, and investments in augmented reality technology. While he agrees with all of these positives, he feels that investors should be reminded of the many risks that exist with Apple stock (AAPL) in the wake of the boost the shares received from the news about Warren Buffett’s big increase to his stake in the company. For example, he noted that Apple has been losing large amounts of market share in China to domestic brands there. Others have suggested that there are already signs of recovery there, although Seyrafi sees no such signs or promise that the company will regain its lost share in China any time soon. He highlighted India as a concern because of Samsung’s dominance and Oppo’s and Vivo’s growth there. Shares of Apple stock (AAPL) closed up 0.17% at $140.88 on Monday.

Graham and Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.com Published: 17:07 EDT, 27 March 2017 | Updated: 17:13 EDT, 27 March 2017 e-mail 68 View comments Anthony Weiner was spotted using the aide of crutches while getting out of a car outside of his New York City residence on Monday amid reports he is trying to patch things up with his wife Huma Abedin. Despite the fact it's still chilly in the Big Apple, the disgraced ex-congressman was photographed wearing bright yellow shorts and a red long-sleeved shirt as he exited from a cab on crutches to head to the residence he shares with Abedin and their young son.  It now appears Hillary Clinton's top aide is trying to save her marriage to Weiner and is ready to forgive him, according to the New York Post.  The fact that Abedin is willing to forgive Weiner is all the more remarkable given the role he played in arguably costing Huma's boss, Hillary Clinton, the presidency. In September, DailyMail.com revealed that Weiner was engaged in a sexting relationship with a 15-year-old girl. That revelation triggered a federal investigation, during which agents seized Weiner's laptop. Scroll down for video  Anthony Weiner was spotted using crutches while getting out of a car outside of New York City home on Monday (above) amid reports he is 'working hard' to repair his marriage to Huma Abedin Despite the fact it's still chilly in the Big Apple, Weiner was photographed wearing bright yellow shorts and a red long-sleeved shirt as he exited the cab to head to the residence he shares with Abedin and their young son  Huma Abedin (right), Hillary Clinton's top aide, is 'working hard' to repair the relationship with her chronically sexting husband Anthony Weiner (left), according to a report on Saturday. The couple are seen in the above May 2, 2016, file photo That laptop contained emails linked to Clinton, and those emails prompted FBI Director James Comey to announce that he had re-opened the investigation into Clinton's private email servers just days before the election.  Though the investigation into Clinton was later closed, pollsters believe that Comey's announcement helped sway enough undecided voters to cost Hillary the presidency. Abedin, 40, filed for divorce from Weiner, 52, last year after the failed mayoral candidate was discovered to have exchanged explicit text messages and photos with a 40-year-old woman – with one of the texts showing a photo of him aroused as his toddler son was lying down next to him. But his wife is reportedly willing to give him another chance. 'Huma has been working hard on her relationship with Anthony,' the Post quotes a source close to her family. 'He has been spending 80 to 90 percent of his time at the [Manhattan apartment] they share,' the source said. 'If there is a disagreement, he goes to his mother's apartment in Brooklyn.' 'Both [his and her] families are hoping they will reconcile.' The Post cited another source close to Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who corroborated the report. The source said that the initial separation was 'more for optics for the campaign and [under] pressure from Hillary's camp.' Given the number of times that Weiner has gotten into trouble over online relationships with women, his wife's willingness to forgive may strike some as astounding. Abedin reportedly is willing to cut her husband some slack given that she 'takes it into consideration that there's been no affair, or physical contact that anybody is aware of.' Abedin, 40, filed for divorce from Weiner, 52, last year after the former Congressman was discovered to have exchanged explicit text messages and photos with a 40-year-old woman – with one of the texts showing a photo of him aroused as his toddler son was lying next to him 'He never met [the women],' a family friend told the Post. 'A lot of [their] friends believe this is an illness, that he is sick.' Abedin was seen recently during a visit to Disneyland with a friend, actor Tony Goldwyn of the hit TV show Scandal. Photographs of Goldwyn spending quality time with Abedin and her son, Jordan Zain, ignited speculation of a romance, but those rumors were quickly shot down by Goldwyn's wife who insists that Huma is a close family friend. The family friend quoted in the Post said that Abedin has no interest in seeing other men. Instead, she is focused on saving her marriage. 'They clearly have rebuilt a life together,' the friend said of Abedin and Weiner. 'How romantic it is, I can't tell you.' Weiner's history of indiscretion dates back to 2011, when he grudgingly resigned from his position in the US House of Representatives after accidentally tweeting a nude photo of himself that he meant to send to another woman. At the time, Weiner and Abedin had been married for less than a year. Then, as he was running for New York City mayor in 2013, more sexually explicit photos were leaked, which Weiner sent to a 22-year-old Indiana woman named Sydney Leathers. That scandal effectively brought his comeback campaign to a stop. Weiner (seen on the left in New York as he is aided by crutches) is said to be spending a great deal of time at home with his wife, even though they are rarely spotted together. Abedin was seen recently hobnobbing with celebs in Los Angeles, including musician David Foster (right)  The most recent scandal came happened this past August, when it was revealed that Weiner continued to sext other women. One of the photos obtained by the New York Post shows Weiner lying next to his son in one photo sent to another woman. That was the straw that broke the camel's back for Abedin, who immediately announced her separation from Weiner in the final months of Clinton's campaign. A few weeks later, DailyMail.com revealed that Weiner was sending sexually charged texts to an underage girl. DailyMail.com broke the story in September: Weiner carried on a months-long online sexual relationship with the teen during which she claimed he asked her to dress up in 'school-girl' outfits for him on a video messaging application and pressed her to engage in 'rape fantasies'. Last September, DailyMail.com revealed that Weiner was sending text message to a 15-year-old girl - like the one above In August, the New York Post reported on sexual chats between Weiner and a 40-year-old woman, during which the former congressman sent her provocative shirtless photos of him while his four-year-old son was curled up next to him in bed The information prompted an FBI investigation, during which computers were seized and the discovery of emails led to the re-opening of an investigation into then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton just days before the election. Investigators found thousands of emails related to the FBI's probe into Clinton's private email server while looking into Weiner's laptop. Clinton and her husband Bill have since blamed FBI director James Comey's decision to launch the probe, just before the election, as one of the reasons she lost.  Weiner kept a low profile following the shocking revelations in October.  In October, he sought treatment at an all-male sex rehabilitation center in Tennessee.  He checked himself into The Ranch, a 2,000-acre recovery facility near Nashville, Tennessee, in early October, where he was seen horseback riding.  Stays at the facility cost up to $30,000 a month.  The New York Post previously reported that he cut short his rehabilitation for sex addiction at the ranch because he 'ran out of money'.  Abedin and Jordan spend the holiday season in the Hamptons, with her mother Saleha Mahmood Abedin, and sister Heba Abedin.  During the same time period, Weiner was seen wandering Manhattan alone. Meanwhile, Abedin appears to have rebuilt her relationship with Clinton following the scandal.  Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched News videos Dead man is cut out of the stomach of a seven metre long PYTHON Monkman gets the better of Seagull in University Challenge semi-final Shocking moment a driver is punched through his car window Driver's hilarious attempt to squeeze car through tight gap Maid caught on camera appearing to be POSSESSED by evil spirits Furious cyclist smashes driver's windscreen with his own bike Mother films invasive TSA pat-down of her disabled teenage son Brazen man catches huge COBRA out of hole with his bare hands Dad confronts policewoman who confiscated daffodils from daughters UNC's Luke Maye goes to his 8AM class after beating Kentucky Dramatic moment a car is struck by lightning as it drives down road Shocking carer steals money out of dementia patient's handbag Horrifying moment villagers cut open a giant python and...

You can install the 560–650 MB update via Settings > General > Software Update or through iTunes. The biggest new feature in iOS 10.3 is one you may not notice: it introduces Apple’s new Apple File System (APFS), which will eventually replace the legacy HFS+ file system currently in use on all of Apple’s platforms (see “What Apple’s Forthcoming APFS File System Means to You,” 24 June 2016). It remains to be seen what, if anything, this will mean for iOS users, but for now, the primary impact is a longer update process than usual while it converts the existing file system. At iMore, Rene Ritchie has a good rundown on APFS’s benefits. So far, I’m finding iOS 10.3 snappier than 10.2, but it’s impossible to say if that’s due to the new file system. Regardless, we always recommend backing up your devices before updating, but doing so is even more important with iOS 10.3. Owners of Apple’s new wireless AirPods will appreciate that iOS 10.3 lets you track the little earbuds with Find My iPhone. You can either track their location on a map or make them play a locator tone. The sound is played on both AirPods and can be muted on each one individually, so if you drop one AirPod, you can silence the one you have so you can better hear the one you’re looking for. Given that replacing just a single AirPod costs $69, this new feature is extremely welcome (see “Apple’s Wireless AirPods Were Worth the Wait,” 20 December 2016). However, there’s a catch: the AirPods must be connected to (and thus in range of) a paired device for this feature to work. So while you should be able to locate an AirPod that disappeared into the couch cushions, you likely won’t be able to find one that you lost during a run. iOS 10.3 brings support for cross-device iTunes movie rentals, which Apple first introduced in iTunes 12.6 (see “iTunes 12.6,” 21 March 2017). Now, finally, you can rent iTunes movies on one device and watch them on another, though you’ll need iTunes 12.6, iOS 10.3, and tvOS 10.2 to do so. Siri sees a few improvements with iOS 10.3, including support for paying bills in supported apps, scheduling in ride-booking apps like Lyft, and checking cricket scores and statistics for Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council. If you own a car that can be controlled via an automaker app, you gain some cool Siri capabilities, such as checking your car’s fuel level and lock status, turning lights on and off, and activating the horn. It’s probably still easier to slam your hand into the steering wheel than to say, “Hey Siri, BEEP!” Speaking of cars, CarPlay gets a few new additions, such as app shortcuts in the status bar, Up Next and the current song’s album in Apple Music’s Now Playing screen, and access to daily curated Apple Music content. Apple has rethought identity in the Settings app. Your identity now takes center stage above all other settings and provides a shortcut to a new, more coherent screen to handle your personal information, payment options, security settings, account information, and Family Sharing. Apple has also addressed the problem of Calendar spam, which made the news late last year (see “How to Stop iCloud Calendar Spam,” 29 November 2016). You can now delete unwanted invites and report them as junk. HomeKit sees some welcome improvements in iOS 10.3: you can now trigger scenes with switches and buttons, and the Home app now shows Accessory battery levels. Other improvements include being able to search for “parked car” in Maps, a new widget and 3D Touch action for the Podcasts app, the option to share podcasts with full playback support in Messages, and hourly weather forecasts in Maps if you 3D Touch the current temperature. Also, iOS 10.3 addresses a bug with Maps that could prevent it from showing your location after resetting Location & Privacy settings, as well as improving VoiceOver stability. There are a couple of additions not mentioned in the release notes. In iOS 10.3, developers can now respond to App Store reviews. I’ve also noticed one small change in Mail: a count of unread Inbox messages in the back button when viewing an email thread. Lastly, iOS 10.3 includes a total of 67 security fixes! When Should You Upgrade? -- Honestly, although Apple doesn’t even mention the move to APFS in its user-level release notes, that’s the main reason to hold off. If there’s some subtle problem that surfaces only once hundreds of thousands of devices have updated to iOS 10.3, you don’t want to be among that group. So we recommend waiting at least a week before installing iOS 10.3, and perhaps longer if you don’t use AirPods, suffer from Calendar spam, or automate your house with HomeKit. After that, though, give it a whirl and enjoy the new features!

December 20th 2016 3 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ The iOS 10.3 update now lets you find your missing AirPods around the house. Rod ChesterNews Corp Australia Network APPLE has today released the iOS 10.3 update for iPhone and iPads but there is one question consumers need to ask themselves before they hit install: have you got the time? For many consumers, the headline features of iOS 10.3 may not seem to have a lot to offer. If you happen to own the snazzy wireless AirPod headphones which are the best product Apple released last year, then you’re in luck. With iOS 10.3, you can add the AirPods to Find My iPhone to make the individual AirPods ping when you’re trying to find them around the house. How the Apple AirPods changed my life The other big obvious change to the iOS happens not on your iPhone but when you plug your iPhone into something else — namely your car. With CarPlay, for those people who have it in their vehicle, there is a change to the display and features on your dashboard. With iOS 10.3, in CarPlay you have shortcuts to the latest apps you used and better features when you’re playing Apple Music. Other improvements to your iPhone and iPad through iOS 10.3 include Siri now being able to give you a cricket score, and now when you rent a movie through iTunes it will be available across your devices. For most Apple users, none of that is a reason to upgrade. If you don’t have Apple AirPods, you don’t have CarPlay, you don’t care about cricket and you don’t rent movies through iTunes, do you still need to update? Short answer: yes. Long answer: yes you do. For Apple AirPod users, the iOS 10.3 update brings welcomed features. Picture: Supplied.Source:AFP One of the lessons of the recent Wikileaks dump is that people are constantly looking for and exploiting security flaws in all our devices, including our iPhones. The best way you can protect yourself in the digital age is keeping your software up to date, which ensures you get the latest security patches. Then there is another benefit of updating to iOS 10.3 that you probably won’t even notice. With iOS 10.3, Apple is updating its file system to something it has called Apple File System — a system that is a lot more clever than the unimaginative name suggests. This replaces the Hierarchical File System that dates back to the earliest days of Macs, with the new system designed for the mobile devices and optimised for flash memory devices. Here is Apple Insider’s best effort at explaining the new file system: “The new file system is built for future expansion, and jumps to a 64-bit inode number allowing the OS to track more than 9 quintillion files on a disk, adds support for Sparse files, builds in support for extended file attributes, and implements support for full disk and individual file encryption across all of Apple’s platforms using multiple keys for user data.” If that is gibberish to you, here is what you need to know. It is designed to make your device faster, by prioritising actions like opening apps. But here is the catch, and what you need to know today. Because of the new file system, today’s update takes longer than normal. When we updated our iPhone 7 Plus this morning, it took a minute to download the update and more than 30 minutes to install it. So, don’t hit “install software” just before you need to head out of the door or use your phone. And, as with all software updates, make sure you back up your iPhone or iPad before you install the software just in case something goes wrong during the install process.

 Apple says it found one underage worker building Apple products last year Kif Leswing Mar. 27, 2017, 5:07 PM 4,519 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty Images/Chip Somodevilla The people that actually assemble Apple products like the iPhone don't actually work for Apple — the Cupertino giant contracts with manufacturing companies like Foxconn and Pegatron to do it for them. And since those companies are based in Asia, which have different labor standards than the US, it's a constant battle for Apple to ensure that its products are built ethically and to its standards. Apple said on Monday that it performed 705 checks on its various manufacturing facilities in 2016, and found 22 core violations of labor and human rights, including bonded labor violations, falsification of working hours, and harassment violations.  The report issued on Monday is Apple's 11th annual report looking at its supply chain. Although the company has faced criticism for working conditions in the past, the company has also been praised for its annual reports and its efforts to increase its supply chain transparency by groups such as Greenpeace. 2016 was the best year for Apple in terms of improvements in the supply chain, according to Paula Pyers, Apple's senior director of supply chain social responsibility, in an interview with Buzzfeed News.  One of the 22 core labor violations Apple found in 2016 was for an underage worker, who was "a 15½-year-old" at the time of the discovery. The legal working age in China is 16.  Apple required the supplier that hired the child worker to "continue paying their wages while also providing an educational opportunity" and provide him "safe passage" home. When the underage worker turns 16, the factory this person worked at will be required to provide a job offer, Apple said.  "There’s absolutely no excuse for anyone under legal working age to be in our supply chain," Apple said in the report. Apple's 705 checks covered 1.2 million workers, according to the report.  "All supplier core violations are escalated directly to senior management at Apple and the supplier, and are required to be addressed immediately," Apple writes.  'We expect our suppliers to show steady improvement' Apple Apple's official underage labor policy lists 15 as the minimum age to build Apple products, unless there's a law in the local region with a higher minimum age. According to the policy, Apple's suppliers should match photo IDs to worker's faces, verify workers' ages through local government offices or online, and inspect their facilities periodically. Sometimes, supplier employees see Apple as a force that is able to put pressure on the manufacturer to improve working conditions, according to an open letter from an worker at an Apple supplier published by China Labor Watch, an activist group. Often, violations like these happen without Apple knowing, which is why the company routinely drops in and checks their facilities, performing about two of these checks per day total during 2016. But there are a lot of factories working on Apple products, so while 705 checks, up from 574 last year, sounds like a lot, it could be higher.  SEE ALSO: Apple just released a huge new update for iPhones — here's what’s new More: Apple Supplier China Labor Watch Supplier Responsibility Child Labor Labor Labor violations Harassment Human Rights facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru Apple says it found one underage worker building Apple products last year Apple says it found one underage worker building Apple products last year The people that actually assemble Apple...

Along with the final version of iOS 10.3, which we covered earlier, Apple has also brought one of the operating system’s most helpful recent features to macOS. The release of macOS Sierra 10.12.4 introduces Night Swift, which makes it possible to alter the colour temperature of the display depending on the time of day. Related: Apple Watch 2 review The idea is to reduce harmful blue light that can get in the way of a good night’s sleep, much like F.lux, a long time favorite of Mac users. For those downloading the software, Night Shift appears in Display options under System Preferences. Just like iOS 10.3, Mac users are getting cricket scores through Siri. and some back-end changes. For Apple Watch users they can download the new watchOS 3.2 update via the Watch app on their companion iPhone. The update adds SiriKit support which means it’ll now be possible to issue Siri-based voice commands to third-party apps, just like on the iPhone. There’s also room for the new Theater Mode, which silences the watch and disables the raise-to-wake functionality. If you’re rocking an Apple TV, tvOS 10.2 will enable faster scrolling and improve mobile device management. Not a lot to see here. What's your favourite new feature on Apple's array of devices today?

Shenzhen Baili had claimed that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus bore striking similarities to the products from its parent company, Digione. But on Friday, Beijing’s intellectual property court disagreed and ruled in favor of Apple. The product designs of the two companies contain differences, the court said. For instance, Apple’s iPhone 6 contains a symmetrical exterior curve on the device, while the design patent from Baili uses an asymmetrical curve. "This one difference has a significant impact on the overall look," the court said in a statement. The two designs also feature other differences that average consumers can easily identify, the court added. State Intellectual Property Office The smartphone design patent held by Shenzhen Baili. According to the court’s statement, Baili said it will look over the judgment, before deciding whether to appeal. The Chinese company has been warning Apple since 2014 about possible patent infringement. However, while smartphone competition in China has been fiercely competitive, the company’s handset business appears to be nonexistent. The site for its 100C smartphone is no longer online and social media promotion for its products has remained inactive for over two years. Baili filed its lawsuit against Apple last year, asking the court to halt iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus sales in the country. In response, Apple appealed the court order, which put the sales ban on hold. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But it’s not the first time that U.S. tech giant has faced lawsuits with local Chinese companies over Apple products. In 2012, it paid $60 million for ownership of the iPad trademark in China, following a legal battle with another little-known Chinese firm called Proview, which was facing financial struggles. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

The release of the software update comes weeks after the sixth and final beta for developer testing was launched last March 14. It also comes after several months since a major update for the Apple TV was launched back in September of last year. The tvOS 10.2 software update comes with a lot of changes and enhancements. Now, users can do accelerated scrolling in apps since the scrolling behavior of the operating system has been improved. The update also adds support for the Device Enrollment Program as well as improved device management. It also includes VideoToolbox that helps developers with speedy encoding and decoding, as per Apple Insider.  To install tvOS 10.2, which also comes with under-the-hood improvements and bug fixes, users should first download the software update on the fourth-generation Apple TV by heading to the Settings app. From there, one should press System, then Software Update to start downloading the update for installation. Another way is by turning the automatic software update option in the Settings app. This automatically downloads and installs software updates, so users won’t have to worry with having to manually upgrade the operating system.  Aside from releasing tvOS 10.2, Apple has also launched a new version of the Apple TV Remote app. MacRumors has learned that the new version of the app has iPad support, thereby, allowing users to run the Remote app on the tablet. Previously, this feature was only allowed on the iPhone. The interface of the Apple TV Remote app for the iPad is very similar to that of the iPhone version. The only difference between the two is the larger screen estate can accommodate display features better. For instance, the Now Playing window has broader controls.  In addition, the Remote app has also been update to include an enhanced Now Playing experience. What this means is that users can now view lyrics and playlists for music, audio tracks, chapters and even captions for TV shows and movies. General software performance enhancements and stability improvements are part of the Remote app update as well.  Apple just released tvOS 10.2 for the Apple TV. The Cupertino giant has also updated the Apple TV remote app. Photo: Reuters/Jonathan Alcorn Related Stories iOS 10.3 Release: New Features, Updates To Apps Apple Sustainability Report: Conditions For Workers At Supplier Factories Improve Apple Reportedly Boosts Efforts To Make Augmented Reality Glasses Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

The new Theater Mode feature, which can be enabled from the Control Center, allows users to mute the sound and disable “Wake Screen on Wrist Raise” with a single button, thereby preventing the Watch from lighting up automatically when the wrist is raised. Haptic notifications are still received unless the user also enabled Do Not Disturb, and the screen can still be lit up manually by tapping on it or pressing the Digital Crown; Apple Watch Series 2 users can also still use the Digital Crown to discreetly peek at their Watch screen.

Apple has also delivered a rather large update for its iWork suite of apps across Mac and iOS. Pages, Keynote, and Numbers are all getting new features today, with a few of those additions going live across all three apps at once. Many of these are rather simple quality of life changes. For instance, throughout all three apps, you can now replace fonts throughout an entire document, and now you’re able to customize items like dates and currencies for your current region as well. In Keynote 7.1, on the other hand, you now can choose to display your slides on a black background, which Apple says should help when you’re presenting in low-light environments. Unquestionably the biggest feature coming to all three apps is new TouchID functionality. With these updates, you’ll be able to access password protected documents using TouchID, which is obviously a big help when you’re trying to pull something up quickly. This feature is going live across all platforms too, so you’ll be able to use TouchID on iPhone, iPad, or Apple’s new MacBooks. Another nifty feature going live across Keynote and Numbers is the ability to track stock information and add it to your presentations or spreadsheets. With a handful of other miscellaneous features – including the ability to post your Keynote presentations to sites like Medium or WordPress – this sounds like a pretty good deal for users who are knee-deep in the iWork ecosystem. These updates are launching today across Mac and iOS, so once you’re done applying the equally beefy iOS 10.3 update, be sure to give Pages, Keynote, and Numbers some attention as well.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Mar 27, 2017 at 2:41PM One of the great strengths of dividend investing is its simplicity. Simply pick a basket of shares from the best dividend-paying companies in the world and let time do the rest. However, successfully executing this strategy requires more than just finding and buying high-yielding stocks. Case in point: Semiconductor giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) currently yields an impressive 3.6% -- well above the S&P 500's 1.9% yield -- but tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), with its 1.6% yield, is easily the better dividend stock to own today. Here are three reasons why. 1. Apple's cash hoard Apple has a war chest of cash roughly the size of the Chilean economy -- $246 billion and growing. This massive cash pile lets the Mac maker continue to fund its massive capital-return program, while still leaving plenty of room to invest in strategic growth initiatives. About $230 billion of Apple's cash and investments are held in overseas accounts so the company can avoid paying stringent repatriation taxes. Instead, Apple borrows against its cash hoard at low interest rates to fund the bulk of its capital return. This strategy could change in light of the corporate tax reform taking shape on Capitol Hill, but even if it doesn't, Apple could continue to grow its dividend payments using its current tactic for years into the future. That may not be the case for Qualcomm. More on that in a moment. Image source: Getty Images. 2. Apple's continued earnings growth Apple's current capital return potential alone makes it a better dividend stock. When considering the earnings bonanza Apple is likely to experience from the coming iPhone 8, the outlook for continued dividend growth only strengthens. Numbers from research analysts at Bank of Montreal indicate that Apple's total iPhone installed base of 715 million consists of 487 million new iPhones and 228 million used ones. According to the bank's analysis, an impressive 31% of those new iPhones, around 151 million, will be two years old or more at Apple's typical iPhone launch date in mid-September. That calculation implies that Apple's installed iPhone base is primed for another sales "super cycle," in which a large number of iPhone owners upgrade to a new form factor. Apple hasn't meaningfully updated the phone's look since the iPhone 6 in 2014, and with rumors of a complete overhaul for the 10th-anniversary edition,  it seems safe to expect a dramatic earnings surge for Apple, which will, in turn, provide Apple more dry powder that it can deploy in the form of even more dividends and stock buybacks. 3. Qualcomm's legal woes Finally, while the future appears bright for Apple, the same can't be said for Qualcomm. After successfully (and expensively) navigating its legal headaches over patent payment collections in China, Qualcomm was recently hit by a wave of lawsuits that place further strain on the chipmaker's profit-center segment. Late last year, the South Korean government fined Qualcomm $853 million on largely the same antitrust grounds the Chinese government used to penalize Qualcomm $975 million in early 2015.  The U.S. Department of Justice filed a similar antitrust suit against the chipmaker in January. Then Apple sued Qualcomm for $1 billion on the same day the DOJ suit was made public. If all that weren't enough, the company also faces an ongoing probe from the EU that could result in additional fines.  Qualcomm has said it plans to defend itself in each case, but the sheer weight of this legal tsunami calls into question whether Qualcomm's patent licensing business will need to dramatically overhaul its financial structure. Having to do so would be most damaging to Qualcomm, which receives roughly two-thirds of its pre-tax profits from its patent licensing segment. Of course, it's difficult to predict the outcome of its legal battles, but the risk that its business model could fundamentally change is yet one more reason Apple remains a better dividend stock than Qualcomm.

The biggest new feature is Night Shift, technology that shifts your Mac’s display towards the red at the end of your day. The update also adds cricket scores for Indian Premier League and the International Cricket Council to Siri. Apple also added a slew of enterprise-specific features. macOS 10.12.4 is a 1.56GB download through the Mac App Store. macOS Sierra Apple’s Patch Notes for iOS 10.3 What’s New in Version 10.12.4 The macOS Sierra 10.12.4 update improves the stability, compatibility, and security of your Mac.

The update got about half way now I just have a blank screen and an unresponsive Mac 🙁 March 27, 2017 at 3:52 EDT PM wab95 March 27, 2017 FWIW: The update went smoothly on my 2012 15″ MBP Retina. March 27, 2017 at 4:29 EDT PM Graham McKay March 27, 2017 Across the many client Macs that I perform macOS updates on I have noticed an increased recent tendency for the update to get “stuck”. My suspicion is that it is happening at the shutdown/restart junction and, just like can happen with a normal restart, some background process is ignoring the OS request to shut down. From memory in all these cases after I force a power shutdown & restart of the Mac, the update then continues to completion. March 27, 2017 at 9:19 EDT PM Bryan Chaffin March 27, 2017 Update went smoothly on my iMac 5K 2015. Haven’t updated my MacBook Air 2011 yet. March 27, 2017 at 10:39 EDT PM MarcusNewton March 27, 2017 Everything went smoothly on my 2014 15″ MBP, and also on a 2010 13″ MBP. I am very happy to see PDF fixes for Preview, as this was a problem I was running into rather often. I am also excited to get Night Shift on my Mac. I have been using Night Shift on my iPhone and iPad since it became available, and love it. March 27, 2017 at 11:15 EDT PM Lee Dronick March 27, 2017 As with Bryan, the update went smooth on my 5K iMac. It went half smooth on my mid 2010 MacBook Pro. There are two accounts on the MBP, mine which is administrator and my wife’s which is user. After the update logging into my account was smooth, but it got hung on the iCloud password for my wife and the screen went black. I had to force restart and everything is fine for now. Now understand that this MBP is getting dog slow. March 27, 2017 at 11:18 EDT PM wab95 March 27, 2017 Also went smoothly on my wife’s 2014 MBA (11″). It did go black for nearly a minute, then restarted and resumed the installation, thus making two restarts for the whole process. That did not happen with my MBP. I believe that Graham McKay is correct about the force shutdown. I recall having to do that with one of my family member’s computer years ago, and installation resumed. I can’t remember which macOS system it was, or the machine. Next will be my daughter ‘s iMac. March 27, 2017 at 11:42 EDT PM Michael33rs March 28, 2017 I don’t see the update available for my late 2011 Mac mini after opening the Mac App store update section. Wondering if this update is available for my older Mac? Bryan, please let me know if the update is indeed available for your 2011 MacBook Air. It it is, then it should also work for my 2011 mini. March 28, 2017 at 4:48 EDT AM Michael33rs March 28, 2017 Whoops. Never mind, Bryan. It just popped up. Will update after my file transfer finishes. March 28, 2017 at 4:57 EDT AM Bryan Chaffin March 28, 2017 Good to know, Michael! I still haven’t had a chance to update. 🙂 March 28, 2017 at 5:58 EDT AM Bryan Chaffin March 28, 2017 MacBook Air 2011 went smoothly. 👍🏻 March 28, 2017 at 12:45 EDT PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Her comments come in the wake of a terrorist attack in London where five people were killed. UK Home Minister Amber Rudd wants tech companies to give her government back door access into our encrypted data Rudd said she wants companies to stop making a “secret place for terrorists to communicate,” according to Reuters. She’s also targeting social media apps, like WhatsApp, that support end-to-end encryption. Last week Khalid Masood drove his car through a crowd killing four people in London, then stabbed and killed a police officer as he tried to get into parliament. Reports say he sent an encrypted message shortly before launching his attack. “It is completely unacceptable, there should be no place for terrorists to hide,” Rudd said. “We need to make sure that our intelligence services have the ability to get into situations like encrypted WhatsApp.” She’s looking to convince technology companies such as Apple, Google, and Facebook, to give law enforcement a way to decrypt messages and data that are otherwise encrypted and secure. Return of the Anti-encryption Argument If that sounds familiar, it’s because the U.S. Department of Justice and FBI were pushing for Apple to do the same thing throughout 2016 in the wake of the San Bernardino shootings. In that case, police recovered a locked and encrypted iPhone from the shooters after they were killed in a fire fight. The FBI turned to Apple for help with the iPhone and were able to recover data from the iCloud account linked to the phone. Apple doesn’t, however, have any way to bypass the iPhone’s built-in encryption so the FBI obtained a court order compelling Apple to make a version of iOS without the limit on how many passcode attempts you cam make before the device destroys all of the data it contains. Apple fought the order saying it would pose a security risk for all iPhone owners even though the FBI insisted the hack was just for the one phone. The FBI’s claim quickly proved to be false as law enforcement agencies lined up to unlock iPhones they confiscated in criminal investigations. The FBI dropped its case only hours before a scheduled court hearing after an independent company hacked into the iPhone. Apple never had to make the hackable iOS version. Security experts criticized the DOJ and FBI saying a back door into our encrypted data is akin to no encryption at all because once someone has the ability to decrypt our data anyone can do it. Their point is that the back door you create for law enforcement is also a back door criminals and rogue governments can exploit. The Same Anti-encryption Fight, but Different Rudd says she’s not asking for the same thing the FBI pushed for. “This is something completely different,” she said. “We’re not saying open up, we don’t want to go into the Cloud, we don’t want to do all sorts of things like that.” What she does want is a way for law enforcement to access encrypted data and communications, which is exactly what the DOJ and FBI were asking for. Either she doesn’t understand what she’s pushing for, or doesn’t want it to sound like a big deal. Rudd’s comments will likely get the same pushback the U.S. government is already familiar with. Weakening encryption in one country is the same as weakening it around the world, and sows distrust in the companies making our smartphones, tablets, and computers. Apple and other technology companies most likely won’t voluntarily comply with Rudd’s request. Instead, companies will continue to resist to protect their own reputations along with our personal data and security.

March 27, 2017 at 5:06 EDT PM MarcusNewton March 27, 2017 If Rudd is really concerned that terrorists “shouldn’t have a way to secretly chat”, then there is an awful lot the British government is going to need to ban and control other then encryption. For example, albeit a contrived example, if one terrorist passes a paper note to another terrorist, which then reads the note and burns it using a lighter, then the lighter allowed the two terrorists to have a secret chat. So by Rudd’s own logic people possessing lighters is also supporting terrorists. The London terrorist also used a car, and I doubt the British government is going to be passing any laws any time soon saying people cannot have cars. Now it is easy for me to be snarky and poke holes is other peoples arguments, and I do sympathize that the UK is still reeling from this latest terrorist attack. I imagine that Rudd and the rest of the British government is trying to do the best that they can given the horror of the situation. However, these situations often lead to knee-jerk reactions and bad decisions, especially with politicians feeling pressure to look like they are doing something. The main problem with terrorism, other then the obvious actual acts of terror, is that the main tactic of terrorism is to use civilization against itself. So the question is how do we protect civilization from terrorism without chipping away at civilization. I think the long-term answer to that is to strengthen civilization, and not just for a few lucky wealthy countries, but civilization for all.

She works at the Concentrix call centre at Jackson Square, where she’s an iOS senior advisor who has been trained on Apple products. “That’s a fancy way of saying if you have a broken (iPhone) or your whole (Apple) computer (went down), you call me,” said the 29-year-old central Mountain resident. “I’ve always been good with computer-techie stuff.” A couple of years ago, Paris never dreamed she would be a techie and working in a full-time job with benefits that she liked and that would give her a couple of promotions. She thought her future was in hairstyling, facials and manicures. Paris had attended a private college for cosmetology and esthetics, but soon found there were few full-time jobs in Hamilton. Fourteen months ago, the unemployed single mother walked into the Goodwill employment centre on Upper Gage and enrolled in the Youth Job Connect program, a five-week program where young people, ages 16 to 29, are given employment training and with the help of a job developer find the field of work which they like and are best suited for. “It’s a helping hand,” said Paris, who was referred to Concentrix where she's been working for more than a year. Tracy Baxter, regional director of client services at Goodwill, said the Youth Job Connect Program is aimed at full-time job-seeking young people who are facing work barriers such as language, education, home difficulties or mental health issues. “They go through a mandatory 60 hours of pre-employment training, which they are paid minimum wage ($11.40 an hour) to attend here,” Baxter said. The pre-employment training includes a variety of learning including resume writing, interview skills, workplace expectations and diversity in the workplace. Once the pre-employment phase is completed, the youth work with a job developer who will help them gauge what their interests are and what field of employment suits them the most. “They figure out who you are while allowing you to figure out who you are at the same time,” said Paris. “To see where you want to go in the future … at the end they kind of assess what are you better at.” Jeff Martin, senior career specialist at the Upper Gage centre, said they emphasize reliability, dependability and motivation to the young people. “The rest is teachable,” he said. Baxter said the centre will provide employers with training subsidies that can cover as much as 75 per cent of the wages. Money is also available for employment-related items such as work boots or a transit pass. Baxter said 65 per cent of their clients will find jobs and stick with them. Most of the rest usually return to high school to finish their education.

Shenzhen Baili had claimed that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus bore striking similarities to the products from its parent company, Digione. But on Friday, Beijing’s intellectual property court disagreed and ruled in favor of Apple. The product designs of the two companies contain differences, the court said. For instance, Apple’s iPhone 6 contains a symmetrical exterior curve on the device, while the design patent from Baili uses an asymmetrical curve. "This one difference has a significant impact on the overall look," the court said in a statement. The two designs also feature other differences that average consumers can easily identify, the court added. State Intellectual Property Office The smartphone design patent held by Shenzhen Baili. According to the court’s statement, Baili said it will look over the judgment, before deciding whether to appeal. The Chinese company has been warning Apple since 2014 about possible patent infringement. However, while smartphone competition in China has been fiercely competitive, the company’s handset business appears to be nonexistent. The site for its 100C smartphone is no longer online and social media promotion for its products has remained inactive for over two years. Baili filed its lawsuit against Apple last year, asking the court to halt iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus sales in the country. In response, Apple appealed the court order, which put the sales ban on hold. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But it’s not the first time that U.S. tech giant has faced lawsuits with local Chinese companies over Apple products. In 2012, it paid $60 million for ownership of the iPad trademark in China, following a legal battle with another little-known Chinese firm called Proview, which was facing financial struggles.  To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 27, 2017 at 2:45PM In a note obtained by Barron's, analyst Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna Financial Group said that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which currently supplies cellular modems for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7 series smartphones, "is putting more incremental back-end modem capacity in place over the next few months." This, Rolland says, supports his team's view that "Intel will increase share in this year's [iPhone] handsets with a strong possibility of 100% share in 2018." Image source: Apple. I don't have access to the full note -- just the blurb publicly published in Barron's -- but I think it's reasonable to expect Intel to put in more cellular modem manufacturing capacity. Moreover, I'd argue that this additional capacity doesn't necessarily reflect more share gains in the upcoming iPhone. Here's why. Intel's natural share gain Even if Intel gets a similar modem allocation in the new iPhones as it did with the iPhone 7 series devices, it's going to end up shipping more cellular modems over the next product cycle than it will during the iPhone 7 cycle. Why? It's simple -- the iPhone 7 series smartphones aren't likely to just go away with the launch of the next-generation models; they're likely to be kept around and sold as lower-cost options as Apple has done so often in the past. Right now, the iPhone 6s series smartphones -- Apple's "mid-range" models -- are all powered exclusively by Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) modems. Once the iPhone 7 series is waterfalled down, the phones sold at those prices will presumably ship with either Intel- or Qualcomm-based modems (depending on the specific model). That means a natural increase in Intel-powered iPhone models and, therefore share gains, without necessarily implying that Apple's next-generation iPhone will see an increased mix of Intel cellular modems. Can Intel take it all in 2018? The analyst suggests that Intel could take 100% cellular modem share with the 2018 iPhone, but to be frank, I'm skeptical. Intel's product competitiveness should improve dramatically with its XMM 7560 cellular modem, which should have the required features/capabilities to allow Apple to source modems entirely from Intel for the 2018 iPhone. However, for reasons that extend beyond the technical capabilities of the product, I'm unconvinced. For one thing, while Intel is certainly building credibility with its cellular modem products, Apple would be unwise to go all in on Intel until the latter can prove that it can execute consistently well over several generations. Right now, Apple has a safety net named Qualcomm to fall back on if Intel messes up, but if Apple bets it all on Intel, that safety net goes away.  Beyond the risk associated with relying entirely on Intel for one of the most critical components of its key product line, there are benefits to trying to play multiple suppliers off each other. There is, of course, additional work on Apple's part to develop/distribute multiple variants of its iPhones, but by keeping both suppliers in the loop, Apple positions itself to keep them both honest in terms of pricing. All else being equal, the lower Apple's component costs, the better its gross profit margins. We'll have to see how it all plays out, but I would be surprised if Apple were to sole source the modem from Intel beginning in 2018.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

Supplier to Start Building A11 Chip in April It's about time for this Apple supplier to start cranking out the most important chip for the upcoming iPhones. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 27, 2017 at 3:30PM Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM), or TSMC for short, has manufactured Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) A-series applications processors, which power the company's iPhone and iPad products, for several years now. Apple first started having TSMC build its applications processors beginning with the A8 system-on-a-chip found inside of the iPhone 6-series devices, and that relationship has continued with the A9, A9X, and A10 processors. Image source: Apple. Per Economic Daily News (by way of DIGITIMES), TSMC is expected to start cranking out Apple's next-generation A-series processor -- which is likely to be branded the A11 Fusion -- in April. Additionally, the report goes on to say that TSMC will "prepare a capacity for production of 50 million units of the chip before July." By the end of the year, the report says, TSMC is "expected to maintain a capacity for rolling out 100 million A11 chips before the end of 2017." In other words, all seems to be going to plan. TSMC to gain unit share at Apple this year It is widely believed that the Apple will sole-source the A11 Fusion from TSMC this year, just as it relied exclusively on TSMC to build the current-generation A10 Fusion chips. If that ultimately turns out to be the case -- and at this point, I don't see why it wouldn't be -- then TSMC stands to gain share at Apple this year. Remember that, today, Apple is selling the iPhone 7 series, iPhone 6s series, and iPhone SE smartphones. The iPhone 7 is powered by the A10 Fusion, built exclusively by TSMC, while the iPhone 6s and SE devices are powered by Apple's A9 chip -- a chip that was dual-sourced between TSMC and Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) (with Samsung believed to have the majority allocation). This means that there's still a fair amount of A-series volume that TSMC doesn't have today. The good news for TSMC, though, is that when the iPhone 7 series waterfalls down to serve as the company's midrange products, a significant amount of Apple's chip volume should transition from Samsung to TSMC. All that will be left for TSMC to try to achieve sole-source status on -- at least, on the iPhone side of things -- will be the spot inside of the entry-level iPhone SE.  It's not clear when Apple intends to update the internals of the SE, but I expect that when it does so, it will get an A10 or an A11 -- either one would be a win for TSMC.  More than just units Not only does TSMC stand to gain unit share at Apple this year, but it should see a sizable increase in silicon content per smartphone. The A11 Fusion is going to be built on TSMC's leading-edge 10-nanometer technology and it is likely that Apple has opted to make the chip relatively large (my bet is on a chip area greater than 100 square millimeters) to dramatically increase the functionality over the A10 Fusion. Those leading-edge 10-nanometer wafers, and ultimately chips, should be relatively pricey, which could help boost TSMC's revenue per iPhone on an apples-to-apples basis. Additionally, the A10 Fusion is significantly larger than the A9 chip was (the TSMC-built A9 measures in at 104.5 square millimeters per Chipworks; the A10 Fusion at 125 square millimeters). So, not only should Apple benefit by taking unit share from Samsung in the midrange iPhone models, but the direct replacements for the TSMC-built A9 chips should be larger chips. That means TSMC will be able to sell Apple a greater number of silicon wafers to support the same level of midrange smartphone volume shipments. A nice cycle for TSMC With respect to Apple, things are looking good for TSMC. It stands to increase the amount of silicon content that it provides per iPhone as well as gain unit share within the iPhone family. Even if Apple's unit volumes don't grow much in the coming product cycle (which, frankly, seems unlikely -- I expect them to grow), TSMC should be in a good position to increase its Apple-related revenue this year.

It has some useful upgrades to the Settings menu and Maps app on your iPhone or iPad. Phones by Vanessa Hand Orellana January 27, 2017 5:11 PM PST @vanehand iOS 10.3: Best new features Apple's new operating system is now available to download. Here are a few changes you can expect with the update. by Vanessa Hand Orellana 2:04 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Apple has just released the official version of iOS 10.3 for everyone, the last major software update for iPhones, iPads and iPods before the big iOS 11 roll out in June. Don't expect obvious changes in this version of iOS, but there are a few subtle tweaks that may be worth the upgrade. 1. Apple ID Profile There's a new profile section at the top of the settings menu with all your account information. Click on your profile to access your iCloud, iTunes, App Store and Family Sharing information in one place and scroll down to see a list of all the Apple devices linked to these accounts. You'll still need to log in to the Find my iPhone app on your phone or web browser to access them all, but it will save you from having to dig through the settings to access each account. 2. iCloud storage breakdown If you pay for extra storage on Apple's iCloud, this next one will be especially useful. You can now see exactly how you're using your iCloud storage by clicking on the iCloud option in this new profile section. Tap the graph at the top of this section to figure out exactly what the storage hogs are. This gives you a device and program-specific breakdown detailing how many gigs of storage are being used by each. If you haven't activated the two-factor authentication on your account (which you should), you'll notice a new "suggestion" section right below your profile in the main settings page. Apple may use this space to give you other suggestions to improve your device's performance, but for now this is the only suggestion that appeared on my phone. 3. Weather in Maps If you're a fan of Apple's proprietary Maps app, you will now have a glimpse of the weather wherever you go. The latest update adds a tiny weather bug to the bottom right-hand corner of the screen showing the current weather conditions in that area. For a seven-day breakdown of the weather just 3D Touch the weather bug or continue holding to open the weather app in a new screen. 4. Find my AirPods If you've splurged on a pair of AirPods, this feature will save you time and money. If not, just read ahead. Sign in to your Find my iPhone app and you should now see the AirPods as one of the devices associated with your account. Click to see the last known location of the 'Pods when they were paired with your phone or ping them to make them ring. Just make sure you're not wearing them if you want to keep your hearing intact. Apple has not disclosed the official release date for iOS 10.3, which means these features are still subject to change. And the final version of the update may still end up including the "theater mode" or any other features Apple wants to debut before WWDC in June. iOS 10.2: 6 reasons you should upgrade These are the best features in Apple's latest software update for iPhone and iPad devices, including the new TV app and 100 new emojis to chose from. by Vanessa Hand Orellana 2:22 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF 5. App compatibility status Chances are, you may be holding on to a few apps that have stopped receiving updates, which could be making your phone sluggish and buggy. iOS 10.3 makes it easy to identify the culprits right from the Settings menu. Click on the About option on your General settings and wait for the information to load. If you have any non compatible apps lying around, you should see an arrow appear next to the number next to Applications. Another click should then take you to the App Compatibility page listing the offenders. The app wall of shame in iOS 10.3.

Manhattan federal prosecutors want to show the jury overseeing Walters’ insider-trading case that Icahn, who Trump once considered for Treasury Secretary, helped Walters make money in 2013 with a single tweet, a recent filing said. If OK’d by the judge, prosecutors w​​ill seek to show that Walters spoke to Icahn about his market-moving investment in Apple shortly before Icahn made it public via Twitter in August 2013, Walters’ defense lawyer, Barry Berke, said in a memo. Berke laid bare the government’s strategy in hopes that he could get it struck down before it gets introduced at trial. We currently have a large position in APPLE. We believe the company to be extremely undervalued. Spoke to Tim Cook today. More to come. — Carl Icahn (@Carl_C_Icahn) August 13, 2013 “Even if Mr. Icahn had shared the fact of his investment in Apple with Mr. Walters in advance of the tweet (of which there will be no evidence), and Mr. Walters then purchased Apple stock, there is no basis to suggest that would violate the securities laws,” Berke said in the memo. Apple’s stock jumped more than five percent in 2013 after the billionaire investor tweeted that he had just taken “a large position” in the iPhone maker. If Icahn’s name is introduced at trial, it will be the second big name to get dragged before than Manhattan federal jury. Prosecutors have already told the judge that pro golfer Phil Mickleson will be a big part of the trial, although “Lefty” — as he is known to fans — has claimed he will not be called as witness. During his election campaign, President Trump often talked about Icahn as a potential advisor and once said he would consider the Far Rockaway native for his Treasury Secretary. Icahn, who said he does not want to be Treasury Secretary, was probed several years back in connection with Walters’ trades in Apple and Clorox, but was never charged with any wrongdoing. “Mr. Icahn has never done anything improper with respect to Clorox, Apple or any other stock, and neither the SEC nor the DOJ has ever accused him of doing anything improper with respect to those or any other stocks,” Icahn’s lawyer Jonathan Streeter said. Walters is on trial for earning billions in allegedly illegal trades — thanks to intel he gleaned from a pal of his who was on the board of butter maker Dean Foods. Last week, the director, Tom Davis, testified that Walters gave him a throwaway cell phone that they dubbed the “batphone” to cover their tracks. The government has argued that it is “entitled to show that Walters’ trading in other stocks—such as Clorox or Apple​ ​—​ ​was not innocent.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under billy walters ,  carl icahn ,  courts ,  insider trading ,  tweets Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next World's biggest dinosaur print discovered in Australia Read Next World's biggest dinosaur print discovered in Australia Share Selection Trending Now in News 123,937 Schumer loses cool with Trump supporter at swanky restaurant 92,653 'One word' sparks ridiculous infighting at ESPN 88,953 The New York Times' ongoing dishonesty only helps Trump Now On Why Michelle Pfeiffer couldn’t get hired in Hollywood Stars who now have normal jobs This is the worst David Beckham has ever looked SEE ALL Now On 10 Sex Scenes That Changed Film History SEE ALL Most Popular This Week Bull gores 11-inch horn up matador's butt Astronaut who walked on moon says he knows the truth...

Andrew Cunningham - Mar 27, 2017 7:30 pm UTC Enlarge / An iPhone 5 running iOS 10. Version 10.3 is likely to be its last big update. Andrew Cunningham reader comments 118 Share this story Apple has just released iOS 10.3 to the general public, an update which is likely to be the last major release of iOS 10; at this point in the year, work usually begins in earnest on the next major release of iOS, which will be revealed at WWDC in June. The update is available for everything that runs iOS 10: the iPhone 5 and newer, the fourth-generation iPad and newer, the iPad Mini 2 and newer, both iPad Pros, and the sixth-generation iPod Touch. The update has been going through the beta process for a couple of months now, and since it’s likely to be iOS 10’s last major update, we’ll spend some extra time with a few of the high-profile features. I’ve also spent a tiny bit of time with the new APFS filesystem, which won’t change much for most people but does seem to free up a small amount of local storage space. Change is afoot… in the Settings app iCloud account settings are front and center in the Settings app now. Andrew Cunningham The older iCloud settings screen is tweaked but still available. Andrew Cunningham You can easily see every device connected to your Apple ID. Andrew Cunningham The Device Info screen for an iPhone. Andrew Cunningham The Device Info screen for an iPad. Andrew Cunningham The Device Info screen for a Mac. Andrew Cunningham The Device Info screen for an Apple Watch. Andrew Cunningham The Device Info screen for an Apple TV. Andrew Cunningham Many of iOS 10.3’s most noticeable tweaks are in the most exciting part of any operating system: the Settings app! The most obvious of the changes moves the iCloud settings screen from about halfway down the list to its own prominent position at the top of the stack. There isn’t a ton of stuff here that doesn’t already exist in iOS 10.2.1, but given that the first thing most people do with their iPhones and iPads is sign in to their iCloud accounts, it makes sense to move this stuff front and center. Particularly useful is a big “Password & Security” section right at the top of the new screen, which lets you change your iCloud password and set up two-factor authentication. This was available before, it was just buried in a non-obvious place (go to the iCloud settings page, then tap your Apple ID, then tap Password & Security). You also get a list of every single device signed in to your Apple ID, including iOS devices, Macs, Apple TVs, and Apple Watches. This provides easy access to serial numbers, Find my iPhone/iPad/Mac info for the OSes that support it, as well as iDevice backup status, iPhone phone number and IMEI information, and Apple Pay information. If a device is lost or destroyed or traded in, you can use this screen to easily remove it from your account, and if you spot a device that doesn’t belong, you can change your password quickly to lock it out. Tapping the iCloud badge here opens a screen that looks mostly like the top level of the old iCloud settings screen looked. This is where you toggle whether to sync photos, mail, calendars, and other things, and it’s also where you turn device backups and Find My iPhone on and off. Keep scrolling down and you’ll get a complete list (with toggles) of every app using iCloud Drive storage; this was previously hidden in a separate iCloud Drive page. There’s a nice storage bar at the top of the screen that tells you how your iCloud storage is being used, but you still have to find the Manage Storage screen to see how much space each individual app and device is using. APFS Further ReadingA ZFS developer’s analysis of the good and bad in Apple’s new APFS file system iOS 10.3 will automatically convert your iDevice’s filesystem from HFS+ to APFS when you install it, making it the first Apple operating system to ship with APFS as a non-beta default filesystem. As we’ve written, it feels pretty brave of Apple (brave in the “possibly foolhardy” sense) to ship a brand-new filesystem on its biggest platform first, where it could cause the most problems if something went wrong. But it also makes a certain kind of sense. iDevices will have predictable and uniform partition maps that Apple already knows all about, since users can’t access the filesystem directly and mess with things. Testing the APFS conversion on every single device that supports iOS 10 (and maybe even every single storage capacity option for every one of those devices) is a lot of work, but there are still a finite number of configurations to test. Further ReadingTesting out snapshots in Apple’s next-generation APFS file system On the Mac, by contrast, people's system partitions could be set up in all kinds of weird and unpredictable ways, making it more difficult to account for edge cases in the conversion process. So iOS gets to be the guinea pig, and macOS (as well as watchOS and tvOS) will likely pick up APFS support in the new major OS updates we see at WWDC this year. iOS doesn’t and has never exposed its filesystem directly to its users, so unlike in macOS where you can pull back the curtain to see how it’s working, the change in iOS will effectively be invisible to users (except insofar as a filesystem that is quietly more modern and robust is a good thing in the long run). User-facing benefits like directory size calculation and cloning files in multiple locations, easily noticeable in macOS, have little bearing in the more locked-down world of iOS. Rumor sites covering the iOS 10.3 betas usually do some hand-waving here, claiming that APFS may be faster or save disk space. I can’t speak to the filesystem’s speed except to say that boot times on three devices I tested under iOS 10.2.1 and iOS 3 beta 7 (a late build that, bug fixes aside, should be more-or-less identical to today’s release build) were the same. But iDevices with iOS 10.3 installed do consistently seem to show larger amounts of space available, as well as larger capacities, suggesting that the conversion to APFS is reducing the size needed for the OS partition. Device Total capacity (iOS 10.2.1) Total capacity (iOS 10.3) Available (iOS 10.2.1) Available (iOS 10.3) iPhone 5S, 64GB 59.26GB 60.46GB 57.93GB 58.89GB iPhone 6 Plus, 16GB 11.87GB 12.18GB 10.91GB 11.25GB 9.7" iPad Pro, 256GB 248.84GB 252.50GB 247.14GB 250.68GB These are small gains in usable capacity, just a few hundred megabytes (the more storage you have, the more you seem to gain). These are also far from real-world conditions—the tests were all done on freshly reset devices that have been allowed to build their Spotlight indexes but had no apps, photos, or browser data on them and hadn’t been connected to iCloud. And without more information, it’s not possible to attribute the space savings exclusively to APFS; it’s merely the most likely of all possible options. Your mileage may vary, but it does look like iOS 10.3 and APFS will help you reclaim a little space.

Apple's latest iOS update will help you track them down An update to Find My iPhone will let users track down their AirPod earphones Can also play a sound through the earphones to help locate them  The feature is available on all iOS devices with the 10.3 update released today By Mark Prigg and Abigail Beall For Dailymail.com Published: 15:15 EDT, 27 March 2017 | Updated: 09:17 EDT, 28 March 2017 e-mail 13 shares 13 View comments When Apple unveiled its wireless AirPods in October, there were concerns about how easy it would be to lose the tiny devices. Now the company has released the latest version of its iOS software with an app to track them down. The Find My iPhone app let users locate their AirPods - as long as they are in Bluetooth range of any iOS devices. Scroll down for video  The Find My iPhone app is due to receive an update that will let users locate their AirPods, if they are in Bluetooth range of any iOS devices FIND YOUR AIRPODS  The Find My iPhone app will let users locate their AirPods, if they are in Bluetooth range of any iOS devices. If the AirPods are within range of any iOS devices signed into iCloud and available, that device's location will be used to show the user where to start looking for the lost earphones.  The app will also be able to play a sound on either or both AirPods to help users track down their location.  The update is part of iOS10.3, released today. Apple has also dropped support for 32-bit apps in iOS 10.3.  If an app was designed in 32-bit, a dialog popup box will appear that says 'This app will not work with future versions of iOS. 'The developer of this app needs to update it to improve its compatibility.' Apple has been warning developers about these changes since February 2015. It also includes a Podcasts app widget, new app animations, and a host of small bug fixes and improvements. The radical wireless earphones, which Apple released in November last year after a one-month delay, have garnered positive reviews. But some people expressed concerns about losing the tiny earphones, which cost $159 (£159) to buy. Now the company has release an app update to allow users to find the gadgets if they ever get lost. If the AirPods are within range of any iOS devices signed into iCloud, that device's location will be used to show the user where to start looking for the lost earphones.

The Cupertino giant is now rolling out the update that brings changes to the operating system of Apple’s timepiece series since watchOS 3.1.3. On Monday, Apple released watchOS 3.2 to general users and owners of the Apple Watch and Apple Watch 2 smart devices. The release of the software update comes months after beta testing was launched in late January and following the launch of the seventh beta last week. It also comes months after watchOS 3 became public back in September last year.  Apple Watch owners can now update their device to watchOS 3.2. To do this, one should pair up the Apple Watch with an iOS 10-running iPhone to download the software update. From the phone, one should go to the dedicated Apple Watch app and head to General. Clicking Software Update from the menu options would launch the Download and Install button, and pressing this will start the download of the update. Once download is complete, the user should connect the Apple Watch to a charger and ensure that it has at least 50 percent battery before proceeding with the installation process. Throughout the installation, the Apple Watch should be in close proximity with the iPhone, as per MacRumors.  As expected, watchOS 3.2 brings Theater Mode to the Apple Watch. This display mode adjusts the screen of the device to a darker shade and puts the smartwatch to silent mode when the owner is inside cinemas. The mode also disables the screen from lighting up when the wrist is raised. Users should tap the watch face if they want to check for notifications and whatnot. These changes are done to ensure that the theater experience of the user is uninterrupted. MacWorld reports that watchOS 3.2 also comes with a Siri update that enables the AI assistant to worth with more apps. Should users need to send messages, make a call, make payments, start tracking of workouts, book rides and many more, they may now rely on Siri to do these. These changes are all part of SiriKit, which was previously made available to iOS devices ever since iOS 10 arrived.  Also part of the watchOS 3.2 is the update to Scribble. The feature that allows users to write text replies on the display now has support for French, Italian and Spanish. Finally, the Apple Watch app on the iPhone is updated to show music playlist sync progress.  Apple Watch smartwatches are getting the watchOS 3.2 software update starting this Monday.

 Apple just released a huge new update for iPhones — here's what’s new Nick Vega Mar. 27, 2017, 2:38 PM 227,903 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple.com Apple is finally giving its customers a way to find their misplaced AirPods — three months after they first hit store shelves. The company began rolling out iOS 10.3 for iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch on Monday. Among a few notable updates is the ability for AirPods owners to use Find My iPhone to play a sound on one or both AirPods if they are having trouble finding them, or view the last location where they were synced with their device if they are feared lost. The latest update for the 6-month-old mobile operating system also features added functionality for Siri, allowing it to access payment apps to pay and check the status of bills. The virtual assistant will now also be able to interact with automakers' apps to check your car's fuel level and lock status, as well as operate the lights and activate your horn. And in perhaps one of the most demanded updates, Siri will now provide cricket scores and statistics for the Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council. But before you update, back up the contents of your device. iOS 10.3 introduces Apple's new file system. I won't go into too much detail — you can read about it here — but know that if there are any issues with your update, your files could be lost. Here are other useful changes included in iOS 10.3: Siri now supports scheduling with ride-booking apps. CarPlay will display shortcuts in the status bar for your last used apps. CarPlay's Apple Music "now playing" display will give you access to the "up next" screen as well as the album of the song currently playing. CarPlay will feature daily curated playlists and new music categories in Apple Music. iTunes video rentals can now be watched across all your devices, rather than just the one you rented it on. You can now share episodes from the Podcasts app through Messages with full playback support. EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

 One of Wall Street's top firms just laid out everything you need to know about the iPhone 8 Kif Leswing Mar. 27, 2017, 2:07 PM 12,836 facebook linkedin twitter email print An artist's conception. Not the iPhone 8. Gabor Balogh Six months out from the anticipated launch of a redesigned iPhone, Wall Street is trying to get a grip on how big the opportunity for a huge sales boom is for Apple. New analysis from JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall distributed to clients on Monday suggests the redesigned iPhone could tap into a huge number of people hanging on to older phones, waiting to upgrade. Analysts have been calling this the "super cycle." "We believe that Street numbers still fail to capture the size of the likely replacement cycle assuming Apple delivers a compelling product this year," Hall wrote.  Hall believes that Apple may be looking to control demand for the new redesigned iPhone, given that so many iPhone users are waiting to upgrade, which is one reason why Apple may opt for a high price tag for the device —possibly over $1,000. Hall writes the high-end iPhone Pro with a 5.85-inch screen will have: "Edge-to-edge OLED screen in a compact form factor Structured-light-augmented main camera to enable re-focusing of pictures after taking them Front-facing 3D scanning for facial recognition, 3D camera effects, etc. Possible elimination of fingerprint sensing Wireless charging Glass front and back Very high price of $1,000+ to limit demand and offset increased BOM [cost of materials]" Hall forecasts the "iPhone Pro" will cost $65 more to make than the iPhone 7, and that it will make up 41% of total iPhone shipments in the fourth quarter.  The rest of the shipments will be partly comprised of an updated version of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, Hall writes. Here's what he's expecting from those models: Wireless charging Glass front and back Possible 3D scanning, though less likely than on OLED model Possible improved camera One of the coolest parts of the rumored redesigned iPhone is that Apple may be able to pack a bigger screen into the same-sized iPhone case. Here's how JP Morgan sees that, in a diagram:  JP Morgan Interestingly, JPMorgan believes Apple looked into making a 5.1-inch iPhone with the same form factor as the current 4.7-inch iPhone, but decided against releasing that device in 2017. Here's what it would look like: JP Morgan The backdrop for investors to all these iPhone rumors is that, on average, iPhones in use are older than they've been at any point since 2014, Hall writes. Currently, the average iPhone in use is 6.4 quarters old, according to Hall's model. Here's that factoid in a chart:  JP Morgan Ultimately, JPMorgan is bullish on Apple: Their models suggest 260 million iPhones sold this year — which would be a huge increase from the 211 million sold in fiscal 2016. JPMorgan rates Apple "overweight" and increased its price target from $142 to $160. EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

It can also be set to turn on and off at custom times. Night Shift can also be toggled on manually using the Notification Center or Siri,” Clover explains.

  SOFTPEDIA®   Windows   Drivers   Games   Mac   Android   Linux   News Softpedia > News > Apple FLASH SALE: Driver Booster 4      40% OFF! iOS 10.3 Officially Released with Find My AirPods, Apple File System, and More GO APFS is a file system for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS Mar 27, 2017 19:00 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Apple released today the final builds of the iOS 10.3 operating system for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch devices, bringing various new features and many improvements. iOS 10.3 has been in development since the end of January when Apple published the first Beta builds to registered developers, allowing them to test drive the upcoming Find My AirPods feature that lets users locate their lost AirPods directly from a supported iOS device running version 10.3 or later. iOS 10.3 also comes with a brand-new file system developed by Apple and dubbed APFS (Apple File System), which is also used on the new versions of the macOS, watchOS, and tvOS operating systems. APFS promises to be a lot faster than the HFS+ file system and more reliable. Siri support was added for checking cricket scores, players, and schedule rosters from the International Cricket Council and the Indian Premier League, a Reduced Motion preference is now available for Safari, a Music-like widget was added for the Podcasts app, and 3D Touch forecast is supported for weather data in Maps. Among other changes implemented in the iOS 10.3 update, we can mention various performance improvements to iCloud Analytics and iCloud Backup, experimental support for new SiriKit car commands, as well as the ability to update your iOS devices from a remote server. Supported devices and how to update iOS 10.3 is officially supported on iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 5s, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 5c, iPhone 5, iPad (9.7-inch), iPad Pro (9.7‑inch), iPad Pro (12.9‑inch), iPad mini 4, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 3, iPad Air, iPad mini 2, iPad (4th generation Model), and iPod touch (6th generation). To update your supported devices, simply open the Settings app, go to the General section and access Software Updates. Wait a few seconds for the iOS 10.3 update to appear and then press on the "Download and Install" button. Your device will be restarted a couple of times for the new iOS version to be installed. However, due to the implementation of the new APFS file system, you should be aware of the fact that the update time could be doubled in some cases, depending on how old your device is. But after a successful iOS 10.3 installation, you should notice a performance improvement when opening apps or multitasking. #iOS 10.3#Find My AirPods#Apple File System#APFS#iPhone 7 subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple AR Glasses Could Arrive Next Year, Development Started in 2016 iPads Were Banned on US and UK Flights Because of Bomb Plot Production of A11 Chips for iPhone 8 and iPhone 7s to Start in April Chinese Court Rules in Apple’s Favor over iPhone 6 Patent Dispute Two Laptops with Hong Kong's 3.7 Million Voters' Data Stolen Samsung Store in Singapore Catches Fire Ahead of Galaxy S8 Unveil All 2017 iPhones to Support Wireless Charging, Apple Watch to Feature LTE How to Upgrade to Windows 10 Creators Update RTM Right Now Survey: 93% of Millennials Aren't Quitting Uber Two Laptops with Hong Kong's 3.7 Million Voters' Data Stolen Latest Black Lab Linux Weekly Build Optimizes Swap File Management for SSD Windows 10, the Only Way to Go: 8 in 10 Companies to Install the OS, Study Shows    iOS 10.3 released new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments All 2017 iPhones to Support Wireless Charging, Apple Watch to Feature LTE more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

The updates are now available for download on compatible iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Apple Watch devices through OTA updates and also iTunes in case of iOS. We had outlined the changes in one of our older posts before but to summarize it again, the 10.3 comes with some notable user facing as well as under the hood improvements. One example of the former is the option to find AirPods under the Find My iPhone app, that plays a sound to help you locate your lost AirPods as well shows their last location on a map. Siri now supports paying bills and checking status with payment apps, scheduling rides with ride booking apps, checking car fuel level, lock status, turning on lights and activating horn with carmaker apps, and Cricket scores and statistics for IPL and ICC. CarPlay, a component of iOS, now has shortcuts in the status bar for easy access to last used apps, Apple Music Now Playing screen gives access to Up Next and the currently playing song's album, and daily curated playlists and new music in Apple Music. Other changes include support for new iTunes feature that lets you rent movies on one of your Apple devices and then watch them on any of the others, new unified view for your Apple ID right at the top in the Settings app, in-app review prompts for developers so you will no longer be thrown from an app to the App Store when you select to give a rating and can now rate the app from within the app itself, ability for developers to leave replies to reviews, new thread view in Mail app to see individual message in a thread as a separate mail, and more. As for under the hood improvements, iOS 10.3 also brings support for the Apple File System, or APFS, which replaces HFS+. As for watchOS 3.2, it now includes Theater Mode, which turns on silent mode and keeps the screen dark until you tap it, so it doesn't turn on the screen when you are in a dark place like, well, a theater. Siri on the Apple Watch now also works with apps to start workouts, send messages, make payments, book rides, and more.

The iOS 10.3 release date includes a new Apple File System, Siri improvements and the much-needed find my AirPods feature. iOS 10.3 allows users to find their AirPods using the “Find my iPhone app,” something iPhone 7 users are eager to have access to, another feature will limit the frequency with which users are prompted to review apps. Read: Will iOS 11 Have Screenshot Notifications? Before you get too excited and start downloading it, be sure to backup your phone. iOS 10.3 Features: Apple File System, Siri, More Additionally the update migrates current files from HFS+ and HFS file formats to the new, better and faster, Apple File System. But the two systems may not be fully compatible, and even if they are, you want to make sure you have all of your data backed up just in case. Other features of the update gives users “more ways to use Siri with payment, ride booking and automaker apps,” says the update description. The other improvements include support for sending podcasts via Messages in full with playback enabled. The new iOS will also help ensure that all of your Apple devices run more smoothly, this includes the ability to rent once on iTunes and watch across all devices and unifies Apple ID information across all devices. The warning box that was reported in beta that details that 32-bit apps won’t work with future versions of iOS is also appearing with the update. This means that come iOS 11, probably, any app that is still not designed for a 64-bit processor won’t work.

Here’s how Apple describes Theater Mode: Theater Mode lets users quickly mute the sound on their Apple Watch and avoid waking the screen on wrist raise. Users still receive notifications (including haptics) while in Theater Mode, which they can view by tapping the screen or pressing the Digital Crown. SiriKit was announced alongside iOS 10 originally, and is now available on the AppleWatch. SiriKit is an API that allows developers to integrate Siri into their applications. This means users can ask their Apple Watch, “Send $100 to Josh using PayPal,” for example.

Apple has today opened up registration for scholarships for WWDC. The company is also kicking off its annual WWDC lottery. Since WWDC is so popular, Apple likes to raffle off the seats available instead of doing a first-come, first-serve basis. Apple is expected to unveil iOS 11 and macOS 10.13 at the conference. The Apple Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off on June 5 and runs through June 9. After being held in San Fransisco for the past several years, Apple has decided to host the conference in San Jose at the McEnery Convention Center instead. If chosen, developers will be charged $1599 USD to attend the conference, which does not include travel or hotel costs. Developers can register at developer.apple.com/wwdc/tickets/; students can visit developer.apple.com/wwdc/scholarships/ for more information.

Watch Series 3 Could Cut the Cord Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Planning to Take on Apple Stores? Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Faces a Price War View All Posts Having conquered online retail, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has become increasingly adventurous with its expansion plans. AMZN has pushed into streaming video and music services, it sells a growing range of consumer electronics (including the popular Echo smart speaker), the company’s AWS servers seem to power half the internet, it’s begun opening Amazon bookstores and it’s even experimenting with its own grocery stores. Source: Amazon Now there is a report the company is mulling additional physical Amazon store options, including potentially going head-to-head against Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Store. Amazon’s Expansion Into Physical Bookstores AMZN has been blamed for the demise of many brick-and-mortar bookstores, from independent bookshops to the Borders chain. The company’s ruthless pricing, open 24/7 website and Kindle e-books have been an unstoppable force. So it caught many people off guard when an Amazon store selling books opened in Seattle in 2015. This was an actual, physical bookstore — just like the ones it had been methodically putting out of business. There are now five of these Amazon Books locations open, with more to come. AMZN stocks them with best-seller titles, and uses them to showcase its devices. But with its growing hardware aspirations and the success of the Echo, there could be a new kind of Amazon store in the works. The New York Times ran an in-depth piece over the weekend that details AMZN’s growing physical retail ambitions. The article suggests that while many observers have been focused on Amazon’s experiments with grocery stores, the company has been exploring the possibility of taking on one of the most successful retailers of all: Apple. Apple began its own expansion into physical retail stores 16 years ago. The company has grown its Apple Store into a retail juggernaut with nearly 500 locations worldwide and it consistently tops the list of sales per square foot. According to the NYT article, AMZN is exploring the idea of an Amazon Store that uses the same concept as the highly successful Apple Store. It would showcase Amazon’s growing offering of hardware. This has grown from Kindle e-readers to include tablets, Fire TV video streamers and the surprise-hit Echo smart speaker. Like Apple, AMZN could give customers hands-on demos of the products and also use the devices to showcase its subscription video and music streaming services. The stores could also include a selection of top-selling consumer electronics from Amazon.com. The company is also reportedly considering physical Amazon Stores that would sell furniture and appliances. This approach would let customers examine the products first-hand — essentially turning Amazon into its own show-rooming experience. It might also include a virtual reality element, with VR technology being used to show what the furniture might look like in a customer’s home.

Apple hasn’t yet detailed what security fixes are included beyond these release notes: Security Update 2017-001 is recommended for all users and improves the security of OS X. The update could be related to recent security vulnerabilities detailed in the news or routine maintenance for older versions. macOS 10.12.4 is the latest version of the Mac operating system for compatible machines and was released earlier today.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars DEV Apple’s Find My AirPods feature arrives with iOS 10.3 Jordan Novet@jordannovet March 27, 2017 10:45 AM Tags: Apple, iOS, iOS 10, iOS 10.3, top-stories Above: iOS 10.3 is rolling out. Image Credit: Jordan Novet / VentureBeat Apple today released the final version of iOS 10.3 to everyone. This is the latest update to iOS 10, which Apple made available in September. Since then there have been small updates, including most recently iOS 10.2 two months ago. Developers and beta testers have been able to try out some of the more significant updates here for the past several weeks. This release comes after no fewer than seven beta releases of iOS 10.3. For those people with AirPods, Apple’s wireless earphones, this release will be crucial, because it includes Find My AirPods — a way to see their location and also have them make a sound so you can get your hands on them again. The other headline feature here is APFS, Apple’s next-generation file system. Apple is moving everyone over from its longstanding HFS+ file system to APFS. People have gotten a taste of APFS through beta releases of macOS Sierra, but now it’s going live for millions of iPhones. In my own use, since Apple made APFS a part of iOS 10.3 beta 5, performance is better going into and out of apps. It might also provide you with a bit more leftover storage space. So looking back on this build, APFS will likely be the most memorable addition. (Unless you have AirPods, that is.) Apple has also enhanced Siri in a few ways. The assistant can now provide cricket scores and figures for the International Cricket Council and the Indian Premier League. Also, Siri can tell you paying and checking status of bills through installed payment apps, she can schedule rides through certain apps, and with the help of apps from automobile manufacturers Siri can also turn on the lights, activate the horn, tell you if the car is locked, and tell you how much fuel is remaining, according to today’s release notes. Apple ID information now sits at the top of the Settings app with this release, and it’s easier to get to security settings from there. The Maps app now lets you search for “parked car.” (Google Maps has been working on something similar.) The Calendar app now lets you delete an unwanted invitation and report it as junk. The Home app lets you “trigger scenes” in association with certain home automation products, and it can provide information about battery power remaining in certain products. Apple’s standard-issue Podcasts app now offers a Today widget that displays new episodes of certain shows, and the app now lets you share playable versions of podcasts through the Messages app. CarPlay has some updates: Now you can access daily playlists and new music categories from the Apple Music app, there’s a Now Playing screen for Apple Music that lets you get to the album of the current song or see what’s coming up next, and there are now shortcuts for your most recently used apps in the status bar. VoiceOver is now more stable in the Mail, Phone, and Safari apps. And Apple has fixed an issue that might have stopped Apple’s Maps app from showing your location after you’ve reset Location & Privacy. Plus, there are security updates in this release. To get iOS 10.3, go to Settings > General Software Update. Also today, Apple released macOS Sierra 10.12.4, which brings Night Shift to the Mac. Apple also released watchOS 3.2, tvOS 10.2, and Xcode 8.3. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat. All rights reserved.

Valentina Palladino - Mar 27, 2017 6:20 pm UTC Enlarge Andrew Cunningham reader comments 26 Share this story The latest update for the Apple Watch is now available. Apple is pushing out watchOS 3.2 today to bring two key features to its smartwatch: Theater Mode and SiriKit. This is the second addition since Apple released the huge watchOS 3 update back in September 2016. Further ReadingReview: The still optional but pleasantly refined Apple Watch Series 2 Theater Mode has been talked about a lot as Apple released betas of watchOS 3.2 over the past few months. It lets you mute sounds and disable the raise-to-wake feature of the watch, meaning its screen won't light up when it senses your wrist turning to check the time. This takes the Apple Watch's current Silent Mode onestep further, essentially eliminating all the lights and sounds the watch would make when triggered by movements or alerts. You'll still receive haptic feedback for incoming notifications (if you have that feature turned on), and you can still view notifications by manually waking the watch's display. Theater Mode can be activated by swiping up from the bottom of the Apple Watch's display and tapping the drama-masks button. Once you turn Theater Mode off, your Apple Watch will go back to your usual settings. WatchOS 3.2 also brings SiriKit to the Apple Watch, which is a feature previously only available on iOS devices. This expands voice commands to third-party applications, letting you ask Siri on the Watch to do more for you like make a payment, call a car, or send a message. App developers must make extensions using Apple's Intents and Intents UI frameworks. So once third-party developers add those capabilities to their apps, you'll be able to do more with Siri from your Watch. WatchOS 3.2 is available for all Apple Watch models, but you must have an iPhone running iOS 10 or later to download the updated software. To download the update, go to the Apple Watch app on your iPhone and navigate to General and then to Software Update. Your Apple Watch must have at least 50 percent battery to download the software, and it must be placed on its charger and within range of your iPhone.

The new file system is called Apple File System. It supports native encryption, though that will be more interesting to see implemented on macOS. It's also optimised for solid-state storage, so hopefully it will be a little smoother to use overall. Aside from that, Apple's also introducing a new Find My AirPods option, in-app review prompts that let you review an app without going to the App Store, and a nice little tweak to the Settings page that makes it easier to access Apple ID info. Mail also gets a new thread view option to make scrolling through a ton of messages a little less cumbersome, and the Podcast app gets a widget. Finally, developers get two nice little new features: The ability to reply to App Store reviews, and the ability to update an app's icon without pushing out an App Store update. You can snag the update now by heading to Settings > General > Software Update. As always, make sure you have a current backup before you update. We haven't heard of any problems with the switch to the new file system, but it's always good to backup everything up before any update.

Prior to today's update, the Apple TV Remote interface was only designed for the iPhone. For those unfamiliar with the Apple TV Remote app, it's designed to be used with the fourth-generation Apple TV and functions similarly to the hardware-based Siri Remote. It includes support for navigation via touch gestures, Siri commands, gameplay, and more. On the iPad, the control interface is similar to the iPhone interface, but there's more screen space to display features like the Now Playing window alongside broader controls. Along with support for the iPad, today's update introduces an enhanced "Now Playing" experience that includes lyrics and playlists for music and chapters, audio tracks, and captions selection for movies and TV shows. General performance and stability improvements have also been baked into the update. Apple TV Remote can be downloaded from the App Store for free.

Sunday Chronicle Hyderabad Chronicle Chennai Chronicle Bengaluru Chronicle Kerala Chronicle Science Editors' Picks Technology, Mobiles and Tabs 5 things you would love about the RED iPhone 7 DECCAN CHRONICLE Published Mar 27, 2017, 1:41 pm IST Updated Mar 28, 2017, 8:46 am IST The device is already in stores and it is priced the same as the other colours of iPhone.  Red variants of Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Apple unveiled the Red coloured variant of its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in collaboration with its ten year old partner RED, an organisation that fights against AIDS. The device is already in stores and it is priced the same as the other colours of iPhone, but like the Jet Black iPhone 7 variants, but it’s not available in the lowest-capacity (32GB) model. It will be only available in 128GB and 256GB variants. Here are few things we think you would love about the new variant. Buying this will save lives Apple is keen to contribute toward building an AIDS-free generation under its decade old partnership with RED, an organisation that fights AIDS. Apple CEO Tim Cook in an interview to Forbes said "Ten years ago there were 1,200 babies being born a day with HIV, and that’s now dropped to 400. So there’s been a lot of progress but we still have work to do to get to an AIDS-free generation by 2020, though we are on target, it’s within our sights.” Raising money for charity is free Apple is surely doing an inspiring job by raising money for a highly admirable cause. So if users are willing to help the cause, its absolutely cost-free, provided they want a 128GB or 256GB iPHone 7 or 7 Plus. It’s the first (PRODUCT) RED iPhone This is first red coloured iPhone the company has produced. However this is not the first time Apple has made RED item, the company has earlier launched cases, Watch bands and other accessories. Apple is the biggest single contributor to the Global Fund which supports HIV/AIDS programs – it has contributed $130 million out of the $465 million the Fund has raised. The rear panel changes colour The red rear panel is just very bright but the matte finish that gives it a subtle effect. Under bright, warm light, it almost glows, with the curved edges catching the light especially. The back panel seems to change depending on the light that falls on it. Detailing is superb Apple has done a superb job of detailing with the RED iPhone, the antenna specially. It lines at top and bottom of the phone, almost matching the body of the phone when out of direct light. The area around the dual camera setup also offers a different shade when the light falls at different angle. No doubt, the new RED iPhone 7 and 7 Plus looks and feels premium, but ultimately the purchase decision boils down to personal taste.

The software update is now rolling out via Mac App Store’s Updates tab. Aside from bug fixes, Siri improvements and a few other enhancements, macOS Sierra 10.12.4 (build 16E195) brings Night Shift Mode to your computer. Night Shift comes to your Mac macOS Sierra 10.12.4 includes Night Shift Mode, a feature that debuted in iOS 9 more than two years ago to help iPhone, iPad and iPod touch owners adjust the temperature of their display from cool to warm, manually or based on the time of day. You can access Night Shift for Mac in System Preferences, Notification Center or via Siri. A dedicated preference pane makes it easy to quickly adjust when a Mac’s display should start gradually shifting from blue to yellow in order to cut down on exposure to blue light, which is said to cause sleeping problems.

Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Apple Meet your new personal trainer, Siri. September marked the first time Siri could complete tasks that involved entering a third-party app on iPhone and iPad. Now, that same feature is debuting with the latest Apple Watch update this week, a spokesperson for Apple tells SELF. Until now, Siri's Apple Watch capabilities have been limited to tasks that involve Apple-created apps, like sending text messages, making phone calls, checking the weather, navigating on Maps, setting alarms, and starting a workout with the Watch "workout" feature. Anything that involves opening a third-party app was off limits. With the Apple Watch update released today, you can now ask Siri to do more complicated tasks like make a payment, book a ride, and start or stop a workout that uses an app. It's a big milestone for her. This means that you can conveniently start, stop, and pause specific workouts without needing to take out your phone or tap your Watch. Just call on Siri with the "Hey, Siri," command, and tell her which app workout you want to do. (Note: Commands may vary depending on the specific app.) While the software update is available today, you may not notice this new feature immediately after updating your Watch. Once the Apple Watch software update is released, each individual developer will need to update their apps to include this integration. Apple anticipates it may take some third-party apps a day or two, as many developers have the updates ready and they will just need to be officially launched. Apple gave SELF a preview of some of the workout apps you can now rely on Siri for. The company confirmed that right now there are nine apps that have the Siri integration ready to go when the Apple Watch update comes out (or very soon after). But it won’t be long before many more developers will get onboard. Until then you can try it out on any of these: Fitso: Fitso supplies workout and meal plans based on your specific fitness goals, and uses a calorie counter and step data to track your progress. Pause and resume your workout with Siri on Apple Watch to help further streamline your regimen. mySwim Pro: Create customized workouts, track your swim, and monitor improvement with detailed analytics in the mySwim Pro app. Start tracking your swim with Siri without even needing to tap your wrist. RunGo: RunGo allows you to create routes in a matter of seconds, and then run them with GPS voice navigation. With Siri integration on Apple Watch, you'll be able to start, stop, pause, and resume your runs using voice commands. Seven: Seven guides you through quick and effective workouts that you can do anywhere, offering motivation and positive reinforcement along the way. Ready to start your workout? Try: “Hey Siri, start today’s weight loss workout with Seven.” Slopes: Slopes helps you track and record your best days on the mountain—monitoring speed, vertical, distance, and lift vs trail time. Start, stop, pause, and resume recording with Siri while your phone stays warm and safe. Streaks: Streaks keeps you motivated to reach your long-term health goals, and reinforces positive habits along the way. Siri’s in-app debut allows users to quickly begin and resume workouts so you can stay in the zone. Zones: Zones monitors and visualizes your exercise intensity throughout your workout. Skip the sweaty finger struggle and start and stop your workout with Siri. Zova: Zova helps you stay active with fitness motivation and guidance. iPhone tucked away in your pocket? No sweat—control your workout with your biggest cheerleader, Siri. Ace Tennis: This new Apple Watch app hasn't been released yet, but is confirmed to include the Siri integration when it releases soon. Ace Tennis helps tennis players improve their serves by hitting the ball at the apex of their swing, at maximum force.

While previous Apple releases, and the usual 'tick-tock' pattern of iPhone updates, led us to expect the iPhone 7 would be a completely redesigned iPhone, in fact it features essentially the same design of the iPhone 6 and 6s. That's the third year now with the same design. Many will say that's a bad thing - but it isn't quite so simple. The iPhone 7 looks gorgeous, there's no doubt about that, boasting an aluminium unibody with curved edges and 2.5D glass that helps make the phone sit in your hand much more comfortably, while also providing a nicer experience when swiping from the side of the display. It isn't just standard aluminium like the material used by its competitors, either - the iPhone 7 features 7000 Series aluminium, making the iPhone more durable without adding much weight and giving the device more of a premium feel. The iPhone 7 is, physically, the same size and shape as its predecessors, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6, measuring in at 128.3mm x 67.1mm x 7.1mm, but with a few notable differences. The rear-facing camera and TrueTone flash are bigger, and the eagle-eyed among you will spot that the antenna lines are gone from the back of the iPhone. Well, not gone, but repositioned to the top and bottom of the smartphone to make them less noticeable and provide a cleaner look. Read next: iPhone 7 vs iPhone 6s | iPhone 7 vs iPhone 7 Plus | iPhone 7 vs Samsung Galaxy S7 While the iPhone 7 is similar to the iPhone 6s in many ways, weight isn't one of them. It isn't heavier to compensate for the larger battery and additional tech; in fact, it's actually 5g lighter than its predecessor, weighing in at 138g. While 5g doesn't sound like a lot, we were surprised at just how noticeable the weight difference was in the hand when comparing the two smartphones, with the iPhone 7 feeling lighter and more comfortable to hold than the iPhone 6s. Colour options At launch, there were two new colours available: Black and Jet Black. The first is a direct replacement of the Space Grey that came before it, but uses a darker shade of aluminium, which we definitely prefer, and is quickly becoming our favourite colour option. Thanks to a black display and black body, there's no visible border between display and body, providing an almost completely uniform look that definitely works in Apple's favour. We've shown the black iPhone 7 to a number of people over the course of a week or so, all commenting that it looks different to any other iPhone - in a good way. Left to right: iPhone 7 & 7 Plus models in Rose Gold, gold, silver, black, Jet Black The second new colour option is Jet Black, which has a high-gloss finish that Apple is showing off in most of its promotional material. While the Jet Black model looks great in photos, we can't help but worry about smudges and scratches. In fact, even Apple has suggested using a case with the Jet Black model if you're worried about imperfections. On its iPhone 7 page, Apple writes: "Its surface is equally as hard as other anodized Apple products; however, its high shine may show fine micro-abrasions with use." However, despite Apple warning users about possible "micro-abrasions", nobody fully understood how easily it scratched until it started appearing in the wild. As you can see in the below tweet, it can go from gorgeous, high-end device to "ew" in a matter of minutes, and users should bear this in mind when thinking about purchasing it: So you thought a jet black iPhone was a good idea. pic.twitter.com/L3j7iqlu5I — Vlad Savov (@vladsavov) September 19, 2016 Oh, and we forgot to mention the most important part: the Jet Black finish is only available on the 128GB and 256GB storage options: there are no (comparatively) budget 32GB models in that colour. Of course, if black isn't your colour, you can also buy the iPhone 7 in the standard gold, silver and Rose Gold colour options. These, along with the matt black, are available across all three storage options. In March 2017, Apple added a sixth colour option to the range: red. This limited edition version is a partnership with HIV/AIDS organisation (Product) RED, and it's the first time the company has released an iPhone together with the charity. The matte red finish is absolutely stunning as it shimmers in the light, and is easily one of the best looking iPhones ever released. It's all about the small touches, too: the mirror-finish silver logo on the rear matches the rim of the Lightning port and Touch ID ring on the front of the smartphone.  As with Jet Black, the matte red version is only available on the 128GB and 256GB models, and is sold separately on the Apple site. Red versions cost the same as other finishes, though a portion of the profits will go towards fighting the spread of HIV and AIDS. Camera design As mentioned, the size of the camera on the rear of the iPhone 7 has been increased, and although it still protrudes from the back of the phone, it bulges out more seamlessly now that Apple has removed the aluminium ring around the camera you'll see on older examples of this design. This is one more element contributing to the clean look that Apple was chasing with the iPhone 7, and although it initially took some getting used to, we love the look of the new camera. The benefits of the tech inside speaks for itself, although we'll come to that in more detail below. However, it's worth noting that while the improved camera was welcomed by many, the new shape of the camera means that existing iPhone 6 and 6s cases won't fit the iPhone 7, despite having otherwise identical dimensions to its predecessors. Water-resistance The iPhone 7 is also Apple's first water resistant phone. Apple has waterproofed individual connections within the iPhone rather than adorning it with ugly rubber plugs, and is officially calling it splash-, dust- and water-resistant, at IP67. That means you can dip it in water up to one metre deep for up to 30 minutes, and the smartphone should survive. If for whatever reason it suffers water damage, however, it's worth nothing that this isn't covered by Apple's warranty and you'll have to fork out for a replacement/repairs yourself. (For more, see How to dry out a wet iPhone.) We've used the iPhone 7 in a number of wet situations, such as in the rain and answering a call in the shower, as well as outright submerging it, and it has performed quite well with no lasting problems or damage. It is worth noting, however, that the sensitivity of the display is affected when submerged or covered in large water droplets, which makes the phone hard to operate when wet. Goodbye, headphone jack One of the big talking points of the iPhone 7, following months of speculation, is the lack of a headphone jack. You've got several options, though: you can plug your traditional (3.5mm) headphones into the Lightning jack using the Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter in the box; use the new Lightning EarPods that come with the iPhone 7; buy yourself a pair of Lightning headphones or wireless headphones, such as Apple's own wireless AirPods. The headphone jack adaptor isn't the best-looking accessory, but let's be honest, when do adaptors ever look elegant? The adaptor works well and it can actually be left on the end of standard wired headphones, removing the need to carry it around separately. It works as well as any adaptor should, and for only £9, we'd be tempted to buy one or two and leave them in places where they're required, at work, say, or in the car (if you use an auxiliary input). Of course, the removal of the headphone jack initially caused a bit of a stir, but we're confident that iPhone users will quickly come to terms with the fact that the 3.5mm jack has been ditched, just as we all did when Apple replaced the 30-pin connector with a Lightning connector. In fact, we've been using wireless headphones for some time now, as they're actually a lot cheaper to pick up than most people realise. And even for those unwilling to stop using their wired headphones, you can buy an adaptor that'll make any wired headphones wireless. Besides, the missing jack paved the way for other enhancements, including a new, larger Taptic Engine for use with new Home Button (more on that below) and a larger battery which Apple claims will offer an extra hour of battery life compared to the 6s. The removal of the headphone jack also paved the way for higher quality audio playback, and while we're not bad-boy teenagers sat on the back of the bus playing the latest Grime tracks full-blast, we've noticed a positive change in audio quality. Playback is not only higher quality, but is also louder, and we can even feel bass emanating from what sounds/feels like the screen itself. While it's hard to notice the jump in audio quality when listening to streamed music, we especially noticed the richer tones when receiving text messages using the same tone we'd used on our old iPhone. It was much clearer, louder and crisper than ever before, making even the annoying text message jingle sound rather good. Home button The Home button is where that improved Taptic Engine comes into play. It's been used to enable a completely flush Home button, that is actually not a button at all, although it still has that familiar Touch ID ring around it. Here's the interesting part about the new Home button - instead of physically moving up and down, pressing the new Home button triggers the clever Taptic Engine to trick your finger into thinking the button is pressing down. The Home button on the iPhone 7 is odd - not necessarily bad per se, but unexpected. And in a fundamental user interface tool like this one, a control you'll be using frequently, that can be off-putting. The solid-state trackpad on the MacBook and 2016 MacBook Pro, as many readers will know, is an astonishing feat of deception: many users would be willing to swear that the trackpad is clicking downwards, so clever is the haptic effect. It doesn't feel like something clever is happening - it just feels like you're clicking it, when you're not. The iPhone 7's Home button is not like that. You can tell at once that something is up: there's physical feedback, sure, and that's important to making a control satisfying to use, but it feels different. The designers have essentially given up on the pretence that you're clicking a button physically. It feels like you're pressing on a piece of unmoving glass, and something elsewhere in the object is buzzing promptly in response. We're aware that the Taptic engine is situated close to the Home button - roughly where the inside bits of the headphone port used to be, going by Apple's publicised diagrams - but, as irrational as this might sound, it doesn't feel like it. It feels like the buzz is deep within the guts of the phone, some distance from the button. To a certain extent you can customise the way the Home button reacts to your touch with varying levels of feedback, but none felt entirely naturalistic to us - at first, anyway. They all felt, well, odd, with setting one offering barely any feedback, setting three offering a much more intense vibration and setting two offering in our view the best of both worlds. However, as we continued to use the iPhone 7, we fairly quickly grew accustomed to the feedback produced by the Taptic engine. After little more than a week of regular use, we had decided we didn't want to go back to the standard Home button. The effort required to use the Home button is less than with the traditional Home button, providing a much nicer overall experience, and the software-enabled button is still sensitive enough to tell the difference between a tap and press, meaning you shouldn't get any accidental activations - we definitely haven't thus far. We've even come to like the feedback provided by the updated Taptic engine, and find ourselves clicking it for no real reason apart from to feel the sensation. The new software-enabled Home button isn't perfect, however, mainly due to the fact that it requires skin-to-glass contact to activate. On the surface, that sounds great - when would a situation ever arise where you wouldn't tap the Home button with your finger? But we can offer a couple of scenarios that we've encountered over the past week or so. The Home button can't be used when wearing gloves, and also can't be used by fingernail to turn on the display and check time/notifications without unlocking the device. That's in part due to the Touch ID scanner being so responsive that it only needs a split-second to unlock your iPhone when touched: a true first-world problem. Display For the third year in a row, Apple decided against upping the (Retina HD-class) resolution of the 750x1334 iPhone 7 display, which is quickly becoming eclipsed by competitors like Samsung with the Quad-HD resolution Samsung Galaxy S7. The iPhone 7's 324ppi (pixels per inch) pixel density simply cannot compete with the eye-watering 577ppi of its main competitor, the Galaxy S7. Still, Apple has upgraded the technology inside the display to provide users with a brighter and crisper display without upping the resolution. How? Apple has improved the display of the iPhone 7 by making it a whopping 25 percent brighter than the iPhone 6s, making it much easier to use in direct sunlight with a maximum brightness of around 700nits. This is combined with the new DCI-P3 wide colour gamut which is primarily used with high-end 4K TVs, and is one of only three smartphone manufacturers to integrate the tech into its phones. The end result? A display that is crisp and gorgeous with great colour reproduction, ideal for everything from scrolling through Facebook to watching movies on Netflix and even editing movies in iMovie. Naturally, the display of the iPhone 7 features the 3D Touch pressure-sensitive technology introduced along with the iPhone 6s, and which allows the display to measure the pressure of the input (your finger), enabling it to tell the difference between a tap and a push. This opened up a whole new world for Apple when it was first introduced, and it has gone from strength to strength since then. iOS 10 introduces a number of new ways to use 3D Touch on the iPhone, allowing you to 3D Touch icons on the Home screen to bring up brand-new widgets, and 3D Touch Messages notifications to open a mini Messages app above whatever app you were already in. Of course, these are only a handful of examples of the ways you can use 3D Touch on the iPhone; you can find the best 3D Touch tips and shortcuts right here. 3D Touch really gives the iPhone 7 the edge over its competitors as none have quite been able to match the responsiveness and features available, including Huawei's flagship P9 Plus. It does take a little bit of getting used to at first, but trust us when we say that if you train your brain to use it when you first get the smartphone, you'll enjoy the overall iPhone 7 experience so much more. Specs, performance and benchmark results Apple's new processor is called the A10 Fusion, and is the first quad-core processor to be found in an iPhone so far. The M10 Fusion is coupled with 2GB of RAM, which remains unchanged from the iPhone 6s but should allow for more processing power, resulting in a responsive, speedy smartphone. Apple claims that this combination makes the iPhone 7 the fastest smartphone in the world, and although it performed far better thank the iPhone 6s in our benchmark tests, it (rather surprisingly) didn't steal the top spot - but we'll come to that below. In real world use, the iPhone 7 is, of course, stupidly fast and responsive, with everything from apps to the camera opening almost instantly. We've played a number of games on the iPhone 7, from fairly basic side-scrollers to 3D, power-hungry apps and not noticed any kind of lag, screen tearing or outright freezing at any time. It can handle anything we throw at it and even when we intentionally tried to get it to slow down a bit by running power-hungry apps, we couldn't. If you're looking for a stupendously powerful smartphone, the iPhone 7 is a solid option. However, whether you really need the extra speed of the A10 Fusion or not is debatable; the iPhone 6S is already plenty speedy enough in our opinion, and even when running iOS 10, there's no sign of lag. It does, however, allow seriously powerful games to be created for the iPhone in the future, and the processor is also designed with efficiency in mind. Apple says that, on average, users will find that their iPhone 7 battery lasts two hours longer than the iPhone 6s did, thanks to the A10 Fusion. What does that translate to in terms of real-life usage? We've found the iPhone 7 battery life to be surprisingly good, allowing us to become less tethered to the wall on a daily basis. Will it last all day? Depending on its usage, sure. We've used the iPhone 7 constantly and never really found ourselves completely out of battery, and with the occasional battery top up throughout the day, we've got no real complaints when it comes to battery life. (Read our tips on How to improve iPhone battery life.) Along with the A10 Fusion processor, users can expect to find an M10 motion co-processor that allows the iPhone to track motion without a significant drain on battery, giving you better battery life when using GPS, fitness tracking apps and more. It also means that the iPhone can automatically track your steps, flights of stairs climbed and more without impacting on battery life, all of which is viewable via Apple's Health app. Apple has also improved the storage capacity of its latest smartphone range, as the company bumped the base model of the iPhone 7 up to 32GB, getting rid of the 16GB option that was never enough space. The 64GB variant is gone too, replaced by a 128GB option, with the new high-end storage option being a whopping 256GB. Well, with a new, improved camera with RAW support and a range of high-performance apps, you'll need all that storage, right? Read next: How to make space on an iPhone Speed benchmark results So, how did the "fastest phone in the world" hold up in benchmarking tests? As briefly mentioned above, while the results of the iPhone 7 were a huge improvement when compared to the iPhone 6s, they're not quite good enough to steal the top spot in this category. Why? Well, let's explain. (And before we go any further, please note that across all of the following speed benchmark tests, higher scores are better.) Let's start with Geekbench 3, which tests the overall processing power of the smartphone - while the iPhone 6s scored a rather respectful 2524 in single core mode and 4400 in dual-core mode, the iPhone 7 blew that out of the water with scores of 3503 and 6088 respectively. While this is a huge improvement on Apple's behalf, it doesn't quite beat some of its' high-end Android rivals, namely Samsung's Galaxy S7. In dual-core mode, the Galaxy S7 scored 6466 according to our benchmark results, 378 points clear of the average score of the iPhone 7. However, while Apple's iPhone 7 wasn't quite the best in terms of general processing power, it comes into its own when measuring graphical power. To measure this, we selected two GFXBench tests - T-Rex and Manhattan - with varying levels of quality/textures, and recorded the average frame rate of each graphic. The iPhone 7 managed to score an impressive 60fps in both T-Rex and Manhattan, beating not only the iPhone 6s (60fps and 52fps respectively) but also Samsung's Galaxy S7, which scored 53fps and 27fps. However, while the GFXBench results are impressive, we must take them with a slight pinch of salt. Why? It's down to screen resolution. While the iPhone 7 features a display with a resolution of 750 x 1334 (326ppi), the Galaxy S7 for example features a much higher resolution at 1440 x 2560 (577ppi). This means that despite being similarly sized, the Galaxy S7 has to power more than double the number of pixels on the display. When running the same game, the S7 will require more power than the iPhone, a factor that will affect its benchmark results. In reality, both the Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7 are powerhouses when it comes to mobile gaming, and you shouldn't experience any real lag when using either smartphone in day-to-day life. Anyway, back to the results. Lastly, we ran the JetStream benchmark which tests the speed of a smartphone's mobile browser - Safari, in the case of the iPhone 7, while Android smartphones often utilise Google's Chrome browser. The iPhone 7 destroyed the competition in this respect with a score of 160.2, blowing the Samsung Galaxy S7 (61), HTC 10 (44.1) and LG G5 (53.6) out of the water. In fact, Apple's iPhone 6s was the previous winner with a score of 113.8, proving that Safari is one of the best mobile browsers available today. Take a look at the interactive graphic below to see how the iPhone 7 measures up to the competition: Camera and photography One area that has had quite the upgrade is the camera department. While the iPhone 7 misses out on the iPhone 7 Plus's dual-lens camera, it has still been vastly improved when compared to the iPhone 6s. It's still 12Mp, but finally has optical image stabilisation across both photo and video modes along with an f/1.8 aperture and a six-element lens. What does this mean to those buying an iPhone 7? Apple says that the improvements will allow users to capture better low light photos and videos with up to 50 percent more light than the iPhone 6s - but does it? We've tested the iPhone 7 camera in a number of conditions including low-light, and we were quite surprised by the images provided by the smartphone. Of course, no phone camera will ever match the quality of low-light images taken by a DSLR, but the iPhone 7 does pretty well. Take a look at this photo taken on the streets of London at night (click to enlarge) - the overall photo looks good with no blatant noise or softness, and with fairly even exposure and good detail. Even when zoomed in at 100% with a 1:1-pixel ratio, you can still make out the details of elements such as the brickwork of the buildings on the lefthand side of the photo, as well as the window frames of the row of houses in darkness. Text, such as the writing on the bus stop to the far left of the photo, is slightly too soft to make out. This is a common issue with low-light photography and something that most smartphones struggle with. In terms of macro photography, the iPhone 7 performs well. It's fairly easy to take macro photos on the Camera app, and combined with the display, it's easy to spot whether it's in focus or not (the Camera did well with focus most of the time). Even when zoomed in at 100%, you can see details of the leaf - although in this respect, we're not sure much has changed from the iPhone 6s as that was also impressive at macro photography. Standard photos are generally evenly exposed with great colour reproduction and fine detail, although environmental factors may affect the quality of the image taken. Take a look at the above photo of St. Pancras Hotel, taken on an overcast day in London - the colours are even and you can pick out individual bricks on the hotel and surrounding buildings, although it starts to get 'soft' towards the back of the photo, an issue prevalent in most cameras. You can clearly make out the writing on buses and vans, and even the Euston Road street sign. Of course, the iPhone 7 features Live Photos support, and this feature has also been improved with the camera of the iPhone 7. Live Photos capture a second and a half of movement before and after the original photo was taken, along with audio, and offers this to you in a GIF-esque fashion activated by pressing down on the still photo. One of the main complaints from iPhone 6s users was that Live Photos were generally a bit shaky and not too clear, a sentiment we tend to agree with. However, thanks to the Optical Image Stabilisation of the iPhone 7, Live Photos are now much improved with better clarity and stabilisation, which should encourage more people to use the feature. The lens isn't the only element of the rear-camera setup to be improved, as the True Tone flash has been enhanced, too - it now features four smart LEDs for a more natural light that is 50 percent brighter than that of its predecessor. It performs well, offering a range of slightly varied light tints for the perfect selfie in dark conditions, although we usually avoid using flash when taking photos unless necessary, as harsh light is never flattering - top tip there. As for the front-facing (selfie) camera, you'll now get 7Mp to play with, up from 5Mp on the iPhone 6s. And to be quite honest there's not much more to say about it. The camera produces more detailed photos than before, but we've not noticed a huge jump in quality as we have with the rear-facing camera. It should be great for FaceTime and Skype, but as you'll be using it to film yourself, you won't see the benefit - only the recipient will. Read next: iPhone photo tips Video But what about videos? How do they fare on the iPhone 7? The good news is that unlike in the past, the Optical Image Stabilisation will work across all photo and video modes, providing users with much smoother videos whether they're filming in 1080p @ 60fps, 4K @ 30fps or 720p @ 240fps for slo-mo. The stabilisation is impressive, there's no doubting that, and can provide users with stable video even when walking along the road, holding the phone with one hand. Take a look at the short GIF below for a better idea of what we mean: The only real gripe that we have with regards to video on the iPhone 7 is that Apple refuses to put some kind of toggle in the Camera app that allows you to change recording modes on-the-fly. Currently, if you want to switch between [email protected] and [email protected] (for example), you need to go to close the Camera app, go to Settings > Photos and Camera > Record Video and select your preferred option. This can make a difference in terms of light levels, as [email protected] will capture less light than [email protected] and thus shouldn't be used in low-light situations, but with no way to quickly change prior to recording, many of us are left with dark videos. Software The iPhone 7 ships with the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS 10. There's plenty we can tell you about iOS 10: It has a refreshed design, Siri enhancements, Photos, a brand new Messages app with its own App Store, Maps and News improvements and lots more. We'd recommend reading our iOS 10 review  and iOS 10 tips for more information about what users can expect with iOS 10 (and you'll get these new features even if you choose not to buy the iPhone 7 - assuming your current handset is an iPhone 5 or later). However, there are a small number of iOS 10 features that are specific to the iPhone 7 and its bigger brother, the iPhone 7 Plus. The first feature is haptic feedback, which we think is quite surprising given that Apple made a huge song and dance about the Taptic engine in the iPhone 6s, claiming it could create subtle bursts of haptic feedback much more accurate than a standard vibration motor. While we're not disputing that the Taptic engine does this (the Taptic engine on both phones are fantastic), we're just surprised that the feature didn't even make it to the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, as we're fairly confident they could've supported it. Anyway, when you interact with certain elements of iOS - from swiping down to access the Notification Centre to swiping through options on a dropdown window - you'll get corresponding haptic feedback that slightly crosses the bridge between software and hardware. It's an interesting sensation, as the phone will give you a subtle 'tap' as the notification centre 'hits' the bottom of the display and bounces, just as it would if the Notification Centre were a real, physical element. It's fun, creates a new sense of depth for iPhone 7 users and we're really disappointed that iPhone 6s owners won't get to experience this new way to use Apple's Taptic engine. iOS 10.1, an update to iOS 10 that came a month or so after the launch of the iPhone 7, introduced additional camera features, namely Portrait Mode. Portrait mode is designed to mimic the kind of shallow depth-of-field photos taken with expensive DSLRs, with the subject of the photo in focus and the background blurred. This is done in part via software on the smartphone, but needs the dual-camera setup of the iPhone 7 Plus to achieve the effect, meaning that even iPhone 7 users cannot access this feature. UK prices Following its 7 September unveiling, the iPhone 7 is on sale now. Read more: iPhone 7 deals. iPhone 7 (32GB): £599 iPhone 7 (128GB): £699 iPhone 7 (256GB): £799 The iPhone 7 is available in three models with three different price tags. The first comes with 32GB of onboard storage, which costs £599. That's more than the £539 the iPhone 6s was when it launched, which is a shame as it hasn't gone up in price elsewhere. It's likely to have something to do with the, er, 'changes' in the economy since the UK voted to leave the EU, but we haven't had confirmation that this is the case. (Read more about Apple's recent UK price rises here.) The second model has 128GB, and costs £699, again significantly higher than the equivalent model of iPhone 6s was prior to the iPhone 7's arrival. In fact, it has increased by £80. The third model is 256GB, which is the highest capacity we've ever seen for an iPhone. This will set you back £799, which is a whole £100 more than the third model iPhone 6s was at launch, and is close to the £819 price tag of the 128GB iPhone 7 Plus, which has a larger display and a dual-lens camera. If you want to buy the Jet Black model, you'll need to opt for the 128GB or 256GB options. It's not available with 32GB capacity. Podcast Before we get to our verdict on the iPhone 7, here's a little audio discussion you may find interesting.

Follow the team on Twitter to get notifications of new episodes. OUR VERDICT So, is the iPhone 7 worth it? While we think the iPhone 7 is a sleek, gorgeous and generally fantastic phone with enhanced cameras, an improved design (with beautiful new colour options), better battery life and a supercharged quad-core A10 Fusion chip, we think it’s a more appealing upgrade for iPhone 6 (and earlier) users. We don't think we could justify the upgrade from an iPhone 6s to an iPhone 7, especially with the price hike in the UK, as the changes aren't as groundbreaking as some we've seen in the past. Don’t get us wrong: we love the IP67 water resistance, the doubling of the storage tiers, the cameras and more. But we think of the iPhone 7 more as a fine-tuned iPhone 6s rather than the next step in the iPhone lifecycle. Think evolution, not revolution.

Is the iPhone 7 Plus worth the price tag, and should you upgrade from another handset to Apple's most expensive iPhone yet? by David Price | 27 Mar 17 Rating Price RRP: TBC Best prices today Retailer Price Delivery   Price comparision from , and manufacturers iPhone 7 Plus review Welcome to our iPhone 7 Plus review, in which we rate Apple's newest and most expensive ever phablet for design, features, camera, screen, tech specs and value for money. If you'd prefer to read about the mid-size iPhone 7, head over to our iPhone 7 review. The iPhone 7 Plus features improved specs over the iPhone 6s Plus, including a quicker-than-ever A10 Fusion processor chip and a twin-lens camera, along with two new colour options (both black - don't worry, we'll explain) and IP67 waterproofing. Our iPhone 7 Plus review will help you decide if Apple's newest and costliest phablet is for you. Thanks to MobileFun for lending us the matte black iPhone 7 Plus we used for this review. Updated to include the new (Product) RED version of the iPhone 7 Plus. If you're interested in the full current iPhone range, take a look at our iPhone buying guide 2017. Or if you'd rather read about future iPhones, see iPhone 7s rumours and iPhone 8 rumours. Read next: Best cheap iPhone 7 Plus deals UK iPhone 7 Plus: Design & build quality Apple traditionally follows a 'tick tock' update cycle with its iPhones: a major, full-number update with a visible physical redesign (iPhone 4, iPhone 5, iPhone 6) followed by a minor, S-branded update that looks roughly or exactly the same as its predecessor (iPhone 4s, iPhone 5c/5s, iPhone 6s). So after the relatively unexciting update last year we were expecting and hoping for a fundamentally different design. In fact, the iPhone 7 Plus is largely the same in overall design to the iPhone 6 Plus and 6s Plus before it: the dimensions are almost identical to the 6s Plus. And the camera still sticks out at the back, which is mildly irritating. Try placing the iPhone 7 Plus face-up on a table and it won't lie down flat: the back lens will prop it up very slightly. It's particularly galling given that the iPhone SE, released back in spring, has a design in which the camera is completely flush. Still, most of us will keep the iPhone cased (see best iPhone 7 Plus cases), which removes the issue entirely. And even if this design has been around for a while now, it remains very smart and attractive. There are a couple of differences from the previous generation. The iPhone 6s's visible antenna bands have been removed, which produces a cleaner, more minimalist design. And more significantly, the headphone port is also gone, which has a similar aesthetic effect but is altogether more controversial. Read next: iPhone 7 vs iPhone 6s | iPhone 7 vs iPhone 7 Plus Colour options The iPhone 7 Plus is available in seven colours, six at launch. Silver, gold and Rose Gold are the same as we got on the previous generation, but Space Grey has been ditched and replaced by two different black finishes, one in matte (just called black) and the other in gloss (Jet Black).  The matt-black iPhone 7 Plus (just called "black") strikes us as pleasantly low-key, although some may find it dull. The highly glossy Jet Black version is more obviously lovely to look at, but it picks up fingerprints like nobody's business and appears to be scratch-prone, too. Then, in March 2017, Apple launched a limited edition red version of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in partnership with AIDS/HIV group (Product) RED, and despite (Product) RED Apple Watch bands and iPods being produced in the past, it's the first time the company has released a limited edition red iPhone. The matte red finish is absolutely stunning as it shimmers in the light, and is easily one of the best looking iPhones ever released. Trust us when we say that even though it looks great in pictures, it looks phenomenal in real life and could be our favourite colour option ever. As with everything Apple, it's all about the small touches: the mirror-finish silver logo on the rear of the red smartphone matches the rim of the Lightning port and Touch ID ring on the front of the smartphone.  As is the case with Jet Black, the limited edition matte red iPhone 7 Plus is only available on the 128GB and 256GB models, and is sold separately on the Apple site. The red versions cost the same as other finishes, though a portion of the profits will go towards fighting the spread of HIV and AIDS. Headphone port The iPhone 7 Plus (like the iPhone 7) hasn't got a 3.5mm headphone jack. You'll need to use Lightning headphones (a pair of Lightning-based EarPods are included with the phone), or go wireless, or use an adaptor. It got a certain amount of applause at the launch event (particularly when Apple ballsily claimed that the move demonstrated "courage"), but in the real world this has not proved to be a popular announcement. People already own headphones, in most cases based on the 3.5mm standard, and don't much like the idea of having to buy a new set to fit the iPhone 7 handsets. Apple fans got so disgruntled about the headphone removal ahead of the launch that a petition was set up to ask Apple to reconsider. More than 300,000 people signed. But the headphone move being leaked ahead of the launch rather drew the sting of the online outrage, and I would say that most people have become relatively sanguine about the whole thing. In part this is because of Apple's announcement that a Lightning-to-mini phono adaptor will be bundled with iPhone 7 handsets, and cost just £9 even if you lose it. Sure, the idea of lugging around an adaptor if you want to listen to your existing headphones is annoying, but you can always use the new EarPods and keep your nice audiophile cans for home use with the adaptor. It feels like a retrograde step, or at least a premature one, but the inconvenience factor just doesn't feel like that much of a big deal now. Nevertheless, now we know there isn't a headphone port on the iPhone 7 Plus, there's going to be a lot of demand for three things: Lightning headphones, Bluetooth headphones (such as the AirPods), and Bluetooth speakers. Read next: iPhone 7 vs Samsung Galaxy S7 | iPhone 7 Plus vs Sony Xperia XZ Premium Home button Piper Jaffrey analyst Gene Munster suggested ahead of the launch that the iPhone 7 handsets wouldn't have a Home button, and that the Touch ID sensor would be built into the screen itself. That hasn't happened. But Apple has substantially redesigned the Home button. Apple has kept the Home button but modified it, changing the button from a moving to a non-moving part, equipping it instead with the haptic technology from the MacBook's Force Touch trackpad. In other words, it 'buzzes' when you apply pressure to simulate a downward press, while in actual fact not moving at all. (For more on the haptic Force Touch trackpad, read 13 ways to use Force Touch on the new MacBook.) This felt odd at first, and on the whole isn't as effective a deception as the MacBook's Force Touch click. This feels different to the old Home button and there's no getting away from that fact. But you get used to it very quickly. It's different, but good in its own way. (Also, we recommend using the most subtle number-one setting for the Home button's haptic feedback, which seems the most natural to us. Read: How to customise the iPhone 7 Home button.) iPhone 7 Plus: Waterproofing As predicted ahead of the launch, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are officially more waterproof than any previous iPhones - although Apple is studiously using the phrase 'water-resistant' instead. The iPhone 7 handsets are rated IP67 for solid and liquid intrusion protection. iPhone 7 Plus: Screen The iPhone 7 Plus has a very similar screen to the iPhone 6s Plus: it's the same 5.5-inch phablet form factor that's been a popular choice for the 6 Plus and 6s Plus, with the same resolution (1920 x 1080) and pixel density (401 pixels per inch): the highest of any Apple product. And while rival manufacturers have gone considerably higher still - Samsung's Galaxy S7 has an astonishing 577ppi - it's debatable whether the human eye is capable of getting much from densities above 400ppi. At this point it's about spec boasting more than appreciable differences in the user experience. We find it a shade too large for our tastes (like the 6s Plus, it stretches the seams of our slim-fit trouser pockets…), but Apple has at least addressed potential problems using such a big-screen device one-handed with a feature called Reachability, which compresses the screen downwards when you double-tap the Home button. (That's not a new feature, mind: it was announced along with the iPhone 6 Plus.) Interface touches like that are key to Apple's appeal. (See: 7 tips for using the iPhone 6 Plus with small hands.) There are a couple of enhancements to the screen for this generation. It's 25 percent brighter, Apple claims (we've not been overwhelmed by this in practice, although it does seem a little clearer for viewing in sunlight), and has a wider colour gamut. iPhone 7 Plus: Camera As expected, the iPhone 7 Plus comes with a dual-lens camera setup on the back (there is no such upgrade for the iPhone 7). This broadly fits with Apple's past behaviour, since the company generally likes to set apart its top-of-the-line phone with at least one feature that isn't available on any other - and it's often something in the photographic line, such as optical image stabilisation. But this is the first time a Plus-branded iPhone has had such a conspicuous physical advantage over its smaller cousin. The dual-lens camera offers a number of potential benefits, many of which will emerge across the coming months as app developers and Apple itself come up with new software features. The most important are optical zoom up to 2x and Portrait Mode, an arty photo mode added in the iOS 10.1 update a month after the iPhone 7 Plus's launch. We're also hoping for post-shot refocusing - if you get a photo slightly off, it's possible with some dual-lens cameras to alter the focus later using the combined data from both lenses - but this looks unlikely. However, we're certain that app developers will come up with all sorts of clever things to do with this hardware.  The iPhone 7 Plus features two different lenses, one of them a telephoto; this is what enables the 7 Plus to offer an optical zoom by switching from one lens to the other. It also has 10x digital zoom, compared to the 5x digital zoom on the iPhone 7 and on the previous generation. We explore the capabilities of the optical zoom in the next section. Read next: iPhone photo tips Camera testing We've spent a lot of time with the iPhone 7 Plus's camera, and while not every shot has come out perfectly - photos taken in harsh electric light indoors sometimes seem to have an almost 'painted' finish, as if they've been put through a retro filter - it's generally performed impressively. Colours are rich, detail is strong, and most of the time the shutter is faster than we're used to. Click to enlarge - but be warned it's a giant file! Let's talk about the zoom for a moment. Thanks to that dual-lens setup, the iPhone 7 Plus is supposed to offer optical zoom up to 2x, with digital zoom taking over after that point. You'll probably know that digital zoom isn't up to much: essentially the phone is cropping into the picture and using software to simulate the additional detail that's required, so photos taken with digital zoom will be that much noisier and more pixellated than a photo taken at normal 1x 'magnification'. Optical zoom, achieved through use of the glassware, should have no such problems. It doesn't quite work out that way - some reviewers have speculated that in fact some element of digital zoom is combined with optical zoom before you reach 2x magnification - but the effect is noticeably better than the 2x zoom on an iPhone 6s Plus. Here's a shot taken with the iPhone 7 Plus at 2x zoom. Click to zoom in (be warned that it's a very large image file). And here's roughly the same shot achieved by moving closer to the subject and shooting at 1x. Again, click to enlarge. Now let's repeat the shot with an iPhone 6s Plus. At 2x zoom: And at 1x zoom, moving closer to the subject: We can get a better comparison of how well the two phones handle the zoom by cropping in tightly to the subject's face. Here we do that for the iPhone 7 Plus: And here's a comparison of the detail in the iPhone 6s Plus's shots: At 2x zoom the iPhone 7 Plus's shot is a bit messier and we're starting to see some pixellation around the subject's ear and neckline. But it broadly holds up. The iPhone 6s Plus struggled much more at 2x zoom - although remember that this is a tight crop and the loss of definition won't be this noticeable in most cases. Portrait mode On 24 October 2016, Apple released iOS 10.1, which added Portrait Mode to the iPhone 7 Plus's repertoire of skills. It's relatively early days, and the feature is still officially in beta testing, but we're loving Portrait Mode so far. Unlike Live Photos, say, which is toggled on or off at the top of the screen and applied to the standard Photo format (it cannot be applied to square shots, for some reason), Portrait Mode is an entirely new photo format accessed via the swipe menu along the bottom of the Camera interface. In the iPhone 7 Plus this menu now comprises, from left to right, Time-Lapse, Slo-Mo, Video, Photo, Portrait, Square and Pano. When you take a shot in Portrait Mode the iPhone also keeps a copy of the image taken conventionally - by default, at any rate. You can tell the phone not to bother in Settings, but it's probably worth keeping on in case the phone gets the focus 'wrong', which has happened to us on several occasions. This also allows us to easily compare the effect of Portrait Mode. (For tips on using Portrait Mode more effectively, see How to use Portrait Mode on the iPhone 7 Plus.) By mimicking the 'bokeh' effect you frequently see when photographers work with DSLR cameras - blurring the background and giving greater prominence to the subject - Portrait Mode produces a more dramatic and attractive shot. Not every picture you take with Portrait Mode will work out this nicely, however: it's important to get the subject at the right distance from the camera, with a background a good distance further away, and good lighting is essential. But Portrait Mode offers tips on setting things up properly. We've found that Portrait Mode works quite well when taking photos of people, and we think that this is in part due to the facial recognition capabilities of the smartphone. The camera then 'knows' where the main focus of the shot should be, and will adjust the bokeh effect accordingly and usually with impressive results. However, the results become a bit more hit-and-miss when it comes to objects, especially if the fore- and background have similar patterns/colours. We've experienced issues mainly to do with focus, as the effect will sometimes blur part of the foreground image thinking it's a part of the background and vice-versa. Lighting is also extremely important, as the telephoto lens used has a smaller aperture than the wide-angle lens it's paired with, and thus lets in much less light. If ideal lighting conditions aren't met, users will likely get portrait photos that look grainy and out-of-focus.  To read more about Portrait Mode, check out the fashion shoot our colleagues put together using the new feature: iPhone 7 Plus vs DSLR photo shootout. You can see how this went in the following video: iPhone 7 Plus: Battery life Thanks to its larger chassis, the iPhone 6s Plus and the 6 Plus before it were both able to squeeze in larger-capacity battery units than their non-Plus equivalents - and these larger batteries were able to more than compensate for the additional power requirements of a larger screen with far more pixels, resulting in higher battery life than any other iPhones. The iPhone 6s Plus is good for about 12 hours of unplugged web surfing, compared to roughly 10 hours with the iPhone 6s. The iPhone 7 Plus has a greater battery life than the 6s Plus (Apple claims that for the average user, it'll last an extra hour between charges), but the iPhone 7 has gained an average of two hours - which means the gap between the standard and Plus models is narrower than in the previous. We test these claims below. Battery life is professedly a hot-button issue for many smartphone buyers, but comments by senior Apple staff make us sense that the company is happy with what it's offering at the moment - particularly for the Plus models - and doesn't intend to make any great sacrifices in order to significantly increase battery life. (And sacrifices would be called for: whether in terms of a larger and heavier device, a higher price tag, a lower-res screen and so on.) Following iFixit's teardown, we know that the iPhone 7 Plus has a battery capacity of 2900 mAh, compared to 2750 mAh on the 6s Plus. Read next: How to improve iPhone battery life Battery testing We tested the iPhone 7 Plus's battery to exhaustion using the battery-test component of GeekBench 3 (a test which has been removed from GeekBench 4). It lasted 10 hours, 8 minutes and 20 seconds. That's a score of 6083. We tested our year-old iPhone 6s Plus at the same time, and it managed only 7:03:30, a score of 4235 - although you should bear in mind that a year's heavy use will wear down a battery unit and result in lesser performance. A comparison between two box-fresh models would be closer. The GeekBench 3 battery test is particularly demanding and you're likely to find that your phone lasts considerably longer between charges than the above figures. iPhone 7 Plus: Processor The iPhone 6s Plus (and the iPhone 6s, for that matter) comes with a proprietary-design A9 processor chip with an M9 motion co-processor. It doesn't take a genius to predict that the iPhone 7 Plus would therefore include an A10 - but Apple has slightly sidestepped expectations by branding it the A10 Fusion. The firm says to expect around 40 percent higher processing speed than with the iPhone 6s Plus's A9, and about twice the performance of the A8. But obviously we decided to see for ourselves. GeekBench 4 processing speed scores Here's how the iPhone 7 Plus compares to the iPhone 6s Plus in the GeekBench 4 speed-testing suite. Higher scores are better. iPhone 6s Plus: 2491 (single core), 4129 (multicore) iPhone 7 Plus: 3434 (single core), 5618 (multicore) JetStream 1.1 JavaScript benchmark scores Here's how the iPhone 7 Plus got in when we used the JetStream JavaScript benchmark. Again, higher scores are better. iPhone 6s Plus: 122.54 iPhone 7: 160.2 iPhone 7 Plus: 168.68 GFXBench OpenGL graphics scores We tested out the iPhone 7 Plus's graphics capabilities in the GFXBench OpenGL suite. Here's how it got on - and the scores for the 6s Plus, for comparison. iPhone 6s Plus: Manhattan onscreen: 39.9fps Manhattan offscreen: 36.2fps T-Rex onscreen: 57.2fps T-Rex offscreen: 67.8fps iPhone 7 Plus: Manhattan onscreen: 43.5fps Manhattan offscreen: 41.1fps T-Rex onscreen: 57.8fps T-Rex offscreen: 83.4fps iPhone 7 Plus: RAM It's now been confirmed by iFixit's teardown that the iPhone 7 Plus has 3GB of RAM, which ought to give it an additional speed advantage over the iPhone 6s Plus, which had 2GB. The iPhone 7, meanwhile, has only 2GB. It's understood that the extra RAM for the Plus model has been included to handle the demands of collating/combining the output of each rear-facing camera lens and generating a final image with the best elements of each. iPhone 7 Plus: UK price The iPhone 7 Plus is available to buy now, having been announced on 7 September and gone on sale on 16 September. Here's the pricing - note that Apple has doubled the storage allocation at each tier: iPhone 7 Plus (32GB): £719 iPhone 7 Plus (128GB): £819 iPhone 7 Plus (256GB): £919 The iPhone 7 Plus is available for direct purchase through Apple's online store. We've got lots more deals here: Best cheap iPhone 7 Plus deals & contracts UK. OUR VERDICT The iPhone 7 Plus has plenty to be pleased about - waterproofing, a twin-lens camera, a specs bump, stereo audio, a customisable Home button - but is there anything here to get passionate about? This is quite clearly the best iPhone yet, with a smart (if unradical) design and an impressive feature set and user experience; the new Portrait Mode is rather lovely, too. But the price is steep. Unless you're particularly in love with big screens or the very latest in camera features, the iPhone 7 may be a better and better-value option. Tags: iPhone Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi.

These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image caption It is understood Khalid Masood's phone connected with messaging app WhatsApp minutes before the attack The home secretary's broadside over encryption is only one part of a wider struggle with technology companies. The power of the companies has grown enormously in recent years and officials believe they have a responsibility to play more of a role in the fight against terrorism. Last year's row between Apple and the FBI, in the wake of the San Bernardino shooting, was ostensibly about access to a specific encrypted phone used by an attacker. But US law enforcement had long been gearing up for a battle over the issue, looking for the right moment to challenge Apple. Some suspect the UK authorities of doing the same in the wake of the Westminster attack. If there is an issue that the government wants to press the companies on though, it is the hosting of extremist content rather than encryption. It is not clear there is a problem getting hold of the communications of Khalid Masood in this case. But a wider principle is at stake, in which government is unhappy at the spread of end-to-end encryption. Companies like WhatsApp will say they are providing law enforcement with assistance but they have designed their systems with end-to-end encryption, which means they are not in a position to provide the content of any communications (although the metadata, if available, can still be very useful). In reality, the government knows that outlawing end-to-end encryption is not going to be as easy. It has just passed new legislation in the Investigatory Powers Bill and revisiting the subject seems unlikely. A further problem is that many of the tech companies are not UK-based and the government's leverage over Silicon Valley firms has its limits. The government may be hoping the new US administration will at some point make pressuring the companies a priority, but predicting when or how the Trump administration will act is not easy. IS propaganda Many of the new, smaller companies providing encrypted services are not based in America either. Telegram, for instance, provides encrypted communications but its founder Pavel Durov is thought to be based in Europe. Larger companies point out that if they were banned from offering end-to-end encryption then their customers (and the targets of law enforcement investigation) would simply move to these smaller providers, who, they argue, are even less likely to provide assistance to governments. They also point to all the stories about hacking and criminal theft of data as to why encryption is so valued by them and their customers. In the UK, the responsibility of companies in counter-terrorism hit the agenda when Facebook faced criticism after it was claimed it could have done more to spot communications by one of the men who killed Lee Rigby. That spoke to a different issue from encryption - how far should companies be monitoring the material on their sites? And when is this helping to fight terrorism and when is it spying on your own users? The tide of propaganda created by so-called Islamic State in the last few years has pushed more attention onto what can be found on websites. Counter-terrorist officials place a high priority in restricting this content, since in their view, extremist material does not just have a radicalising effect but is directly involved in inciting acts of violence. Media captionAmber Rudd: "Intelligence services need to be able to get into encrypted services like WhatsApp" A meeting on extremist content had been previously scheduled for this Thursday, and comments by the home secretary and foreign secretary prioritised this issue (including the company Telegram again, which is seen as a distributor of content). Officials want two things from the companies - a greater prioritisation of the issue and a more proactive rather than reactive stance. YouTube says it rapidly reviews content flagged to it in order to see if it violates the company's community guidelines which prohibit things like gratuitous violence or inciting others to commit violence. But while companies maintain they do remove extremist content when it is reported to them, officials say it is not good enough. The police run a counter-terrorism internet referral unit in which officers have the difficult task of scouring extremist sites for videos of things like beheadings and then flagging them to YouTube and others for removal. Should terror police see WhatsApp chats? The companies concur with almost all of their referrals. But officials ask why it is that the police are having to do this and not the companies themselves? They point out that the companies are huge, rich enterprises full of clever people and ask why they only assign small teams to work on this subject. They want more resources both in terms of people and technology to be assigned to the task. Image copyright Getty Images Companies point to the sharing of 'hashes' between platforms which relates to material they are removing so that other companies can see if similar images are also present on their sites. They have, in the past, always stressed that such activity is not automated but subject to human review. The companies claim it is technically difficult to scan for extremist content in the same way they do for things like images that show child sex abuse. Officials say that companies that pride themselves on their cleverness should be able to find new - possibly automated - tools. But one of the concerns of companies is that they will be seen as spying on their users. Scanning everybody's posts or messages for extremist content risks making them look intrusive. The reality is, though, that they already scan and mine their user's data for advertising since that is primarily how companies Google and Facebook make their profits. But the Edward Snowden revelations highlighted that co-operation with governments can lead to a backlash. The companies additionally are increasingly global rather than national. They fear precedents being set in one country being used in others. What if other countries also demand extremist content is taken down but define extremist in a different way - perhaps targeting domestic political opposition? China poses a particular dilemma for the tech companies. Apple is in the China market but it is not entirely clear what kind of data it provides to the state. Facebook is keen to get in. Image copyright The Guardian Image caption Edward Snowden, a former US National Security Agency (NSA) contractor, revealed extensive internet and phone surveillance by US intelligence Although they have not ruled it out, politicians in the UK know that legislation is unlikely to be the answer to these problems. Their best bet is try to put pressure on the companies through public opinion since they are the users the companies rely on. This tussle has been going on for years but the balance has been shifting in recent months. The fact that they have not paid much tax has helped turn public opinion against companies. Recent revelations that they have placed advertising next to extremist content has also put them on the back foot. The companies say they are not complacent and have indicated they are willing to be more proactive and use technology in new ways. But they also will know that the pressure is mounting.

Tickets are priced at $1,599. Tickets will be doled out using a random selection process, implemented because in past years, tickets sold out within a matter of minutes. Approximately 5,000 attendees are expected at the conference, which will also be attended by Apple executives and more than 1,000 Apple engineers. The 2017 Worldwide Developers Conference will start on Monday, June 5, and will last through Friday, June 9. Apple announced the conference in mid-February this year, as it is the first that will be held outside of San Francisco in many years. In 2017, WWDC will take place at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California, which should be a welcome change for many developers as it is less expensive to secure accommodations. Apple says that it is working with the city of San Jose and local businesses to plan "very special experiences" around San Jose during the week of the conference, so this year's event promises to be unique. Along with the ticket lottery, Apple is now accepting WWDC scholarship applications for students and STEM organization members who don't have the funds to attend the conference. Scholarship applicants, who must be at least 13 years old, have a chance to earn both tickets and accommodations for the 2017 event. Apple is asking prospective scholarship attendees to share a visually interactive scene created in Swift Playgrounds that can be experienced in three minutes. Swift Playgrounds for iPad or Xcode on macOS must be used, and Apple will judge applications on technical accomplishment, creativity of ideas, and the content of written responses. Apple's ticket lottery will end on Friday, March 31 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time, while Apple will take scholarship applications until Sunday, April 2 at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time. Lottery winners are likely to be notified on April 3 by 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time as that is when Apple will begin charging credit cards. Developers and students who are not selected to purchase a ticket will be able to watch both the keynote event and sessions with engineers through the Apple Developer website and through the WWDC app for iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV.

Last week Samsung introduced Bixby, which is their new AI service. It is similar to Apple Siri, Google Now and Microsoft Cortana. It is on the new Galaxy S8. Samsung is coming late to the AI party, but since we are still very early in this new wave, being late won’t hurt them. The big question is, how usable and accurate will Bixby be? Current levels of AI like Siri, Now and Cortana have delighted the child in us, but are so far very unimpressive and inaccurate. Sure, when they were launched, it was exciting, but after a few years and after many improvements, they still get more wrong than right. The excitement is gone. Today we expect more from AI. Will Samsung Bixby be a hit or a flop? This is the world Bixby is entering. Are they ready? I have not yet used Bixby, but let me share my expectations. While I expect Bixby to be a welcomed addition to the world of AI, I don’t expect it to be very useful in these early stages. Every Bixby competitor is wrong more than it’s right. However, AI is the future, so it will get better as the months and years go by. Samsung is coming at this from a different angle. Apple Siri, Google Now and Microsoft Cortana were introduced as a new service from companies on their growth path. Amazon Alexa and Google Home have also entered this space and are even better. IBM Watson is even better. However, all these companies were in their growth mode, and their AI offerings only added to their position in the mind. Direct AI competitors Like Apple Siri, Google Now, Microsoft Cortana If Samsung introduced Bixby a year ago, before the fire storm, they would have had a stronger chance of success. They would have been in the same position as their competitors. However, they didn’t. And a few short months ago Samsung dealt with a blow that would have put a smaller company out of business. So, this is a shaky time in the history of Samsung. Now they are introducing Bixby after that fiasco. They could indeed be successful if it’s a great technology. But the stakes are higher than ever. If Bixby is good–I mean really good–it could take the eye of customers and investors off of yesterday’s disaster and focus on the future. That’s the big if. Other AI competitors Like Amazon Alexa, Google Home and IBM Watson Remember, wireless and smartphones are a very strong, growth industry. They always have been and they always will be. But as an industry, that is changing, as it always has changed. Going forward, growth will come from new areas and AI will play in increasingly important role. So now we wait. We wait to see if Samsung Bixby is a hit. We wait to see if they can wave their magic wand and make the horrific and disastrous yesterday disappear and be replaced by a fast growing and captivating new growth story. We wait to see if Samsung can indeed step back into the plus side of the equation. So, Samsung, you are up at bat. Hope you hit a home run. You need it.

The first update, iOS 10.3, is for iPhone and iPad. It's the third major update to the iOS 10 operating system since it released in September. Apple has been testing iOS 10.3 since January. It is now available as a free over-the-air update for all iOS 10 users. The most significant change it brings is Find My AirPods, which is part of Find My iPhone. With this new function, AirPods owners locate a lost earphone should one be accidentally lost or stolen. It basically plays a sound to help you find an AirPod nearby. To use the feature, open (or download, if you don't yet have it) Find My iPhone. This latest version of iOS also added a new Apple File System, which Apple said is optimised for flash/SSD storage and includes improved support for encryption. Apple iOS 10 tips and tricks: See what your iPhone can do now What is Apple Clips, how does it work, and when can you get it? Apple has also released MacOS Sierra 10.12.4, the fourth major update to MacOS Sierra, which debuted in September. It has been in testing since January. It is now available as a free over-the-air update for anyone running MacOS Sierra. It can be downloaded using the Software Update function in the Mac App Store on your Mac laptop or desktop. The biggest change it brings is Night Shift mode to the Mac. We first saw Night Shift on iOS devices, with the release of iOS 9.3. It can subtly shift the display of a device from blue-emitting hues to more yellowish, thereby reducing your exposure to blue light. Blue light is thought to interrupt your sleep patterns and may even cause insomnia. To activate Night Shift, go to the Displays section of System Preferences. It can also be enabled through the Notification Center or Siri. The latest versions of MacOS Sierra and iOS 10 have added several other changes and smaller tweaks. We will update this post when we've had a chance to comb through all the additions.

A major question that followed was what impact that might have on developer community events usually held in San Francisco during Apple’s major conference. Now two prominent conferences for the Apple community that take place during WWDC week have unveiled their plans for this year. Sony A6500 AltConf which was once branded as AltWWDC will follow Apple’s conference to San Jose: AltConf, the Alternative Apple Developer Conference, returns for its seventh year and, following Apple’s surprise relocation of WWDC, is also moving to San Jose, CA, 5–8 June. We’re extremely excited to announce that AltConf 2017 will be held in the San Jose Marriott — not only is this next door to WWDC, but it also has a direct connection to and from WWDC! Tickets to attend are free and the speaker lineup will follow today’s announcement. Layers, a design conference also promoted by Apple last year, has also moved to San Jose this year: The Layers Design Conference is brought to you by Opening Night, helmed by world-class duo Elaine Pow and Jessie Char. When not working on Layers they consult on brand and event planning projects using their combined experience in design, tech, and retail. The rest of the time Jessie and Elaine enjoy sitting on the couch in healthy discussion over the pros and cons of what to eat next. Attendees can buy early bird priced tickets to Layers now; the speaker lineup is also coming soon.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS US Edition Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides Samsung Galaxy S8 iPhone 8 LG G6 Nintendo Switch Nokia 3310 VPN News Your iPhone would be really secure with this air-tight protective case Your iPhone would be really secure with this air-tight protective case By Emma Boyle Mobile phones   No need for breathing space Shares A recent patent published by the US Patent and Trademark Office and spotted by Patently Apple shows that Apple isn’t just focusing on making the iPhone smarter – it’s working on cases too.  We’re not talking novelty cases that look like cats, either, as great as they are. This is a case that would turn the usually fragile iPhone into something considerably more sturdy, thereby giving it a wider appeal. The stand out feature of the case would be that it’s completely air-tight with a smart detection mechanism that will notify users when their handset is secure. This is possible because the case would come in three parts which the iPhone itself fits between.  Super secure The bottom part which would cover the back of the phone contains the majority of the technology including a battery, memory circuit, processing circuit and electrical contact detector.  The electrical contact detector is the key component in making sure the phone is aligned correctly inside the case, while the processing unit and battery would work together to run a program stored on the memory circuit that communicates whether or not the case is safely securing the phone. If the iPhone is aligned, this program would be able to tell the user via their phone that that’s the case. If the handset isn’t secure, the device will be able to provide feedback to the iPhone detailing what measures must be taken to lock it securely in place.  Once the phone is securely in place, the user will be able to place a silicone sealing element over the phone’s screen before enclosing it between the top and bottom parts of the case.  The patent shows that when the various parts of the case are aligned around the phone, the user will be able to lock it in place by turning a latch on the case’s rear. Whether the latch is locked or unlocked would be displayed on the iPhone screen. Once the latch is locked, the patent suggests that the pressure involved will compress the sealing element against the iPhone screen, providing an ingress barrier and protection against shock should the phone be dropped.  Though this may seem like an excessive amount of protection for everyday use – though we all know an excessively clumsy iPhone owner that should perhaps consider it – it makes the iPhone a viable handset option for those who work or play in extreme conditions.  For example, deep sea divers who work underwater or armed forces personnel who are stationed in desert locations wouldn’t be able to use an iPhone even if it had a good standard case. With an air-tight case, however, water, sand and force damage would be much less of an issue meaning these people would be able to keep the consumer handsets on their person.  It’s not clear whether or not the phone would actually be usable when inside the air-tight case, though the patent does say that some iterations of the case may include a force detection sensor capable of sensing when force is applied to the display. This suggests that it would therefore be possible to interact with the phone screen, though it may just be be to ensure that the sealing element is properly positioned between the back and front of the case. This is, of course, just a patent exploring an idea so it’s not clear when or if we’ll ever see an airtight iPhone case come to the market. But it suggests Apple may be looking to court users with more rigorous daily lives. 7 Apple patents that will shape the Apple Watch 3 and beyond Related news Samsung Galaxy S8 vs iPhone 7: which is better?

What security? Four million data records are stolen or lost every day iOS 10.3 sounds like a minor update, but it actually contains a pretty big change. Apple is using this update to change the file system that iPhones and iPads use from the 30-year-old HFS+ file format to the new Apple File System. Apple File System is a huge improvement over HFS+, bringing with it features such as optimization for solid state storage, strong encryption, better file time stamping (down to the nanosecond), and many storage saving improvements. Apple plans to move macOS, iOS, tvOS, and even watchOS to Apple File System. But the two file systems are not compatible with each other, and once you upgrade to Apple File System, there's no way to convert back to HFS+ without blowing away all your data and reformatting the storage. What this means is that when iOS 10.3 is installed, every file stored on the device will be converted from the old format to the new format. And while we can expect that Apple will put a lot of effort into making this conversion process as smooth and painless as possible, upgrading a file system always opens up the possibility that something can go wrong. And if something does go wrong, data loss is a real possibility if the upgrade process has started converting files. Which is why you need a backup.

The company released its 11th annual Supplier Responsibility progress report Monday. Read: New All RED iPhone 7 Price: iPhone 7 Plus, 9.7-Inch iPad, iPhone SE Models Now Available To Order The company conducted more than 700 supplier audits in 2016 to be sure that companies partnered with Apple are complying to sound employee policies, the report said. Additionally, 2.4 million workers employed by Apple and Apple suppliers were trained on their employee rights in last year alone, according to Apple. Suppliers Apple uses employ more than 1.6 million people around the world and 98 percent of those suppliers comply with the work hour standards Apple puts forth. “Our team works hard to raise the bar every year to improve working conditions, provide educational opportunities, push for higher standards of living, and protect human rights,” Jeff Williams, Apple’s Chief operating Officer, wrote in a letter included in the report. Apple has faced controversy over its association with the supplier Foxconn. In 2012, Apple authorized an investigation by the Fair labor Association of the supplier after poor working conditions at Foxconn facilities were revealed. In 2009 several Foxconn employees committed suicide at a plant in China, a trend that continued, and in 2012 and again in 2013 violent riots among Foxconn employees broke out.  Since then Apple has increased the number of audits it conducts each year to ensure those who work at the suppliers they user are treated fairly. In addition to sound employee policies Apple also helped suppliers conduct business in an environmentally friendly way. In the past Apple has been accused of covering up unsustainable practices at its factories and those of suppliers.  But the new report says that as part of Apple’s “Energy Efficiency” program the suppliers reduced 150,000 metric tons of carbon emissions from entering the atmosphere in 2016 and Apple has saved over 3.8 billion gallons of fresh water since 2013. And Apple is working to bring clean energy to power the plants in the future.  Related Stories Apple Supplier Foxconn Uncertain About iPhone Manufacturing Plant In The US Apple Assembler Foxconn Plans Expansion in U.S. Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Dedicated: The actress, who 'consciously uncoupled from husband and Coldplay front man Chris Martin, is still mainly based in London with their children, Apple and Moses This week's Spanish excursion was not all work for the blonde beauty. Earlier in the day, Gwyneth indulged in a bit of sightseeing, sharing a radiant selfie with fans showing a view over Barcelona in the background.  Beaming under a bright blue sky, the health guru wrote: 'Good Morning Buenos Días Bon Dia Barcelona!'  Glowing: Earlier in the day Gwyneth indulged in a bit of sightseeing, sharing a radiant selfie with fans showing a view over Barcelona in the background  The Shakespeare In Love actress appears to be a big fan of Barcelona, even posting a hot spot guide on her lifestyle website Goop.   Gwyneth and her kids joined as Chris Martin made a tour stop in the Spanish City with Coldplay in 2016. Offering a rare glimpse of Moses and Apple, Gwyneth posted a photo with her children on a balcony. Engaged? A new report claims that Gwyn's beau Brad Falchuk (seen here with Paltrow in this picture shared March 1) could pop the question 'soon' And this time, the world famous Oscar-winning actress may be glowing for reasons not explained by an antioxidant-filled green smoothie.  Last week UsWeekly claimed Gwyneth would love to wed her current beau, Scream Queens producer Brad Falchuk. A source told the publication that the actress wanted to get engaged 'soon', adding: 'They talk about marriage all the time and know it will happen.'  Family Favorite: The Oscar winner posted this shot with son Moses, 10 and daughter Apple, 12 from Barcelona in May of 2016 It may work out, as the magazine source said both Apple and Moses 'love Brad'. The loved up couple have been dating since the summer of 2014, but reportedly met years earlier when Gwyneth filmed a guest appearance on Falchuk's other hit show Glee in 2010.  Brad divorced his wife Suzanne, with whom he has two children, in 2014 - before the couple got together.  Private: Gwyneth and Brad have never walked on a red carpet together, only being spotted in paparazzi shots like this December 2016 picture or on Instagram Don't expect Gwyneth to be as showy if she and her beau Brad walk down the aisle, as she and husband Chris Martin were very camera shy during their marriage. 'We’ve never ever walked down a red carpet together, we never will,' she said in 2009.  Gwyneth and Brad seem to be following that same rule, as they have only been spotted together by the paparazzi and in rare social media posts.  Solo: In their 10 years together, Gwyneth (here in 2016) and ex Chris Martin never walked a red carpet together   Read more: Us Weekly: Latest Celebrity News, Pictures & Entertainment The Barcelona Guide | Goop Share or comment on this article e-mail 44 shares Most watched News videos Dead man is cut out of the stomach of a seven metre long PYTHON Monkman gets the better of Seagull in University Challenge semi-final Shocking moment a driver is punched through his car window Driver's hilarious attempt to squeeze car through tight gap Maid caught on camera appearing to be POSSESSED by evil spirits Furious cyclist smashes driver's windscreen with his own bike Mother films invasive TSA pat-down of her disabled teenage son Brazen man catches huge COBRA out of hole with his bare hands Dad confronts policewoman who confiscated daffodils from daughters UNC's Luke Maye goes to his 8AM class after beating Kentucky Dramatic moment a car is struck by lightning as it drives down road Shocking carer steals money out of dementia patient's handbag Horrifying moment villagers cut open a giant python and...

You can now track the location of Apple’s wireless earbuds in the Find My iPhone app, either by playing a sound from one or both misplaced AirPods, or seeing the location where the earbuds were last connected to your iOS device over Bluetooth. There’s some other user-facing stuff as well: developers can now publicly respond to reviews in the App Store, and you can label reviews from other people as helpful (or not so helpful). Watching rented movies across your various devices gets much easier as of this update, too. The other big change in iOS 10.3 is a significant changeover to a new file system: the Apple File System. First introduced at WWDC 2016, Apple describes AFS as “the next generation in storage.” Once you’ve installed the update on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, AFS will replace the existing HFS+ file system. You, the user, probably won’t notice much — except for maybe a slight increase in available storage space. But overall, AFS is better for encryption, scaling across devices, and optimized for SSDs. Separately, Apple also launched mac OS Sierra 10.12.4. There, the big new thing is Night Shift on the desktop, which reduces blue light in the display to help you sleep better if you’re on your MacBook before bed — and you believe the science on this stuff. Oh, and the Apple Watch is also being updated with a Theater Mode today. If you’ve got any nerdy tidbits included in any of these updates that you like, please do share.

By Jake Smith for iGeneration | March 27, 2017 -- 17:34 GMT (10:34 PDT) | Topic: Mobility Jason Cipriani/ZDNet Apple on Monday released iOS 10.3 for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, most notably adding "Find My AirPods," Wi-Fi calling for Verizon customers, general fixes, and more. The Find My AirPods feature is found within the Find My iPhone app, and it can help AirPod users find their wireless headphones. A new file system was introduced in iOS 10.3: Apple File System (APFS), instead of HFS+, which could begin Apple's push to 64-bit only apps and stronger encryption. General fixes and updates include new app transitions that subtly change the speed apps open and close. A new Apple ID profile section in the Settings app gives easier access to your account, and a new feature within iCloud settings gives a better break down of how much cloud storage you are using. See also: How to get your iPhone or iPad ready for iOS 10.3 The iOS 10.3 update also adds ability for developers to respond to App Store reviews for the first time. Verizon users who want to access Wi-Fi calling continuity won't have to enable anything -- the feature will kick-on automatically for iCloud users. When your Verizon signal becomes weak, your iOS device will switch to Wi-Fi for stronger connection if possible. The update is now available free to download over the air or through iTunes for all iOS 10 users. Apple on Monday also released macOS 10.12.4 with Night Shift for Mac, and for Apple TV, tvOS 10.2, which focuses on "new features, bug fixes, and improvements in the OS and SDK."

[Photos: courtesy of Apple] By Mark Sullivan03.27.17 | 1:14 pm Apple has traditionally had strong bonds with the education market. It’s also offered healthy discounts on computers to all kinds of schools. As with many of the company’s policies, these moves have had a look of goodwill about them, but also neatly aligned with a shrewd marketing objective: hook young people into the Apple mindset when they’re young so that they’ll buy Apple stuff (at full price!) in the future. Recently, however, the company has been so focused on selling phones and searching for the “next big thing” that it has taken its eye off traditional focus areas. Education might be one of them. As the New York Times reported earlier this month, Google has begun eating Apple’s (school) lunch with its stripped-down, inexpensive Chromebooks, which have an average selling price of $300. By contrast, the average price of an iPad is about $425. Unit-wise, Chromebooks dominate K-12 sales. Futuresource Consulting says U.S. primary and secondary schools bought 12.6 million devices last year, including 7.3 million Chromebooks, 2.8 million Windows laptops and tablets, and 2.4 million iPads and Mac laptops. It wasn’t so long ago that Apple was the clear leader in education, especially as mobile devices became more popular in the classroom. In 2012, according to Futuresource, the company had 52% of the K-12 market, compared to less than 1% for Chromebooks. In the third calendar quarter of 2013, reported Mashable, Apple made more than $1 billion in sales to education that quarter, a new record. Most of that figure was from iPads. CEO Tim Cook didn’t sound worried by Google at the time: “We see Chromebooks in some places, but the vast majority of people are buying PC/Mac or an iPad,” he said. The rise of the Chromebook in education isn’t a disaster for Apple’s bottom line, which has been fattened up by iPhone sales in recent years (78 million of them shipped in the last quarter alone). But the company may be losing young hearts and minds, and that could really hurt later on. And though it’s recently taken a number of steps to make iPads more appealing to educators, it’s only done so after the Chromebook became a classroom staple. “In this day and age of massive budget cuts in education, price points of devices have become more important.” School administrators, and the consultants who help them buy computers, have been increasingly shifting to Chromebooks because they’ve been far less expensive than iPads. “In this day and age of massive budget cuts in education, price points of devices have become more important than the identifying the best device for student-centered learning within school districts,” says education consultant Lucy Gray, who helps schools procure learning technology. Chromebooks also have physical keyboards, which is seen as a real-world usability advantage by educators and regulators. In fact, standardized testing rules in some states require that students use a computer with a display, mouse (or touchpad), and a physical keyboard. Catering To Classrooms With all this in mind, Apple’s March 21 iPad announcements add up to a move to bolster the iPad’s prospects in education. It announced a low-priced 9.7-inch iPad, an inexpensive keyboard snap-on keyboard from Logitech, and some cool new software enhancements for educators. The new 9.7-inch iPad will sell to schools for $299, bringing it into rough alignment with the Chromebook. Schools can buy the new iPads in 10-packs at $2,940 for the 32 GB Wi-Fi model, and $3,940 for 10 of the 128 GB Wi-Fi model. Shipping is free to educational institutions, an Apple sales rep told me. An iPad in Logitech’s new, Apple-approved case/keyboard. For schools that require a physical keyboard, Apple now has an answer, via a collaboration with Logitech. From Logitech’s release earlier this week: “We worked with Apple to design the Rugged Combo to be incredibly durable and protect iPad while bringing a secure keyboard connection that’s approved for testing, so teachers and students can focus on expanding what’s possible inside the classroom and beyond.” Logitech’s case includes a rugged keyboard attached to a hard cover that protects the iPad against drops. Educational administrators like Chromebooks for another reason: their manageability. Everything is stored in the cloud, so any student can use any of a school’s Chromebooks to access educational content and other apps. Apple has been working to make it simpler to manage a fleet of iPads, via its Classroom app for schools. With a classroom full of iPad-using kids, a teacher can open lessons on all the iPads in the room at once, then project one student’s work up onto a monitor in front of the room. It’s now easier to let students share devices, and to move content directly from one iPad to another in the classroom. But even with Classroom, iPads aren’t front ends to a cloud-based experience—something Google’s Chrome OS was designed to enable from the start. Work To Do Ultimately, many people involved in education, including Gray, believe Apple has a unique understanding of the teaching process, and the vision to enhance it with new tech tools. “If you are looking to really change the teaching and learning experience for teachers and students, then investigate iPads,” Gray says she advises school administrators. “iPads allow for more flexibility, creativity, and personalization than any other device on the market.” The problem is, this vision might have been trumped for too long by the premium pricing Apple has placed on devices like the iPad. Another vision may have taken its place–Google’s. “Curriculum is being structured around Chromebooks—the idea of utilizing 1:1 cloud-based computers in the classroom,” points out Above Avalon analyst Neil Cybart. “While Chromebooks are cheap, school districts are discovering ways of using them in the classroom.” “Apple needs to beef up their marketing efforts and get in front of teachers more often.” With the new $299 iPads, Apple has finally removed price as the main barrier to schools buying the devices. As analyst Cybart says, it’s pretty obvious the company doesn’t want to cede the classroom to “cheap laptops.” But there’s real reason for skepticism about Apple’s chances. The Chromebook is not only attractively priced, but also well suited to schools–and, now, entrenched. If Apple really wants to reclaim the education market, it may have to do still more. Depending on adoption levels of the new 9.7-inch iPad over the next year, the company may have to be ready to offer deeper discounts for educators. On the software side, it may have to look at adopting a more cloud-centric approach to device management, security, and content sharing. Another thing that might help: spending more time with the educators and administrators who have long been advocates for Apple products, whether at conferences or in classrooms. There are signs that the company understands this. “Apple needs to beef up their marketing efforts and get in front of teachers more often,” says Gray. “Many years ago, they stopped having a presence at education trade shows. And they seem to be making more of an effort in this area recently.” Fast Company Daily Newsletter: Get our best stories delivered to your inbox.Sign Up I'd also like to receive special Fast Company offers Related Stories Technology Bluetooth Trackers And The Race To Help You Find Your Stuff Technology Chris Berka’s Lifelong Quest To Make Consciousness Visible Technology How Restaurants Use Big Data To Learn More About Their Customers Video The Lesson Your Startup Needs To Learn From Thinx’s PR Nightmare Trump's Wall Is Also Dividing The Architecture Community This Plane Could Fly To Europe In Under 4 Hours--And Other Stories You Might've Missed Americans Are Becoming Increasingly Unhappy, According To The Global Happiness Report How Matt Damon—And A Bunch of Balloons—Are Raising Awareness for World Water Day What John Legend Learned From Working in Consulting Hollywood Can't Win When It Comes To Race Your Next iPhone Can Now Come In Red Former Thinx CEO Miki Agrawal Revealed Her Questionable Office Behavior Last Summer Former Thinx CEO Miki Agrawal On Why Thinx Didn't Offer Period Leave How Sweetgreen Stays Competitive In A Crowded Space Of Dining Options A Microsoft Engineer Discusses Why Diversity In Tech Will Make Better Products Now You Can Literally See The Differences Between Apple And Google These Married Chefs Prove Working With Your Spouse Isn't Always A Terrible Idea Why One CEO Says It’s A Company’s Responsibility To Speak Out Politically Buzz Aldrin Wants To Take You To Mars--And Other Stories You Might've Missed Beauty And The Beast Has Had Some Wonderful (And Weird) Adaptations How This Company Could Allow You To See The World--While Juicing Why This CEO Thinks Millennials Are Socially-Conscious And Good For Businesses These AI-Powered Robot Spiders Utilize Your iPhone's Incredible Processor This New Technology Uses Your Phone To Track Your Heart Health You’ll Never Guess What The Most-Shared Story Was On Facebook In February Wolfgang Puck Impressed His First Boss—And Built A Career From It President Donald Trump In A Minute How One Modeling Agency Is Diversifying The Runway You Can Land A Drone On This Vehicle--And Other Stories You Might've Missed Why This Psychedelic Drug Is Drawing Entrepreneurs To Peru How Diversifying Barbie's Look Dramatically Increased Sales Why This Bento Box Of Clothing May Be A Woman's Answer To Getting Dressed For Work These Companies Are Making Political Statements—But Staying True to Their Customers more stories It Only Took 5,000 Years, But The Flip-Flop Is Finally Getting Smarter Tom Colicchio Wants To Transform How We Think About Food Policy How Fake Fixes To Fake News Could Lead To Real Problems “Mixed Nuts” Over “Pulp Fiction”?

Apple releases iOS 10.3 as well as macOS, watchOS and tvOS updates Posted yesterday by Romain Dillet (@romaindillet) 0 SHARES Next Story Android creator Andy Rubin teases first look at Essential’s bezel-less smartphone It’s patch day at Apple. The company just released four new versions of its four operating systems for all its devices — iOS 10.3, macOS 10.12.4, watchOS 3.2 and tvOS 10.2. Some of those updates are more important than others. Let’s start with iOS 10.3. The new version adds Find My AirPods, and we already covered what you can expect from the new feature. You can see them on a map if they’re connected to an iOS device or you can play an alarm if you have an AirPod hidden below a stack of magazines. And if they’re not around, you can see the last location when your phone was connected to your AirPods. With iOS 10.3, Apple is rethinking ratings in the App Store with native review prompts and the ability to reply for developers. iOS 10.3 also adds a couple of new Siri features, such as cricket sports scores. There also are various improvements, such as a thread view in Mail and dynamic app icons. Finally, Apple is secretly updating all iOS devices to APFS, a new file system. This should be completely transparent for the user, but it’s a major change as this new file system has been designed from the ground up to work with mobile, always-on devices with flash storage. In watchOS 3.2, Apple is finally updating Siri to let you use Siri with third-party apps, just like on your phone. For instance, you could order a Lyft or call someone using WhatsApp from your Apple Watch. There’s also a new Theater Mode button so that the screen remains dark in a movie theater. On macOS, Apple is bringing Night Shift. Just like f.lux, it favors warmer colors at night. This should allegedly improve your sleep. Real-time collaboration in iWork on macOS and iOS is out of beta. tvOS 10.2 doesn’t add much except the ability to rent a movie on an Apple device and watch it on another, such as your Apple TV. This is a long-overdue feature. As always, you should backup your device to iCloud or your computer before updating. This is particularly true for your iOS device, as the new file system is a big change. Head over to the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad to update. Open the Mac App Store for the macOS update. Open the Watch app on your iPhone for the Apple Watch update. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase iOS Description iOS is Apple's operating system for their mobile devices.

Rubin teased the company's first device on Monday, posting an image to Twitter and noting that he's "really excited about how this is shaping up" and is "eager to get it in more people's hands." Here's the full tweet. Little is known about the new smartphone just yet, but the image is rather telling. It appears to have an edge-to-edge that spans almost the entire front of the device. Samsung is expected to offer a similar screen on the Galaxy S8, which it will announce next week, and Apple may adopt similar technology for the iPhone 8. Speaking of Apple, Cupertino may have been to blame for SoftBank's decision to pull as much as $100 million in funding from Essential. That news surfaced last week, amid rumors that Apple may have strong-armed SoftBank to pull out from backing Rubin's fledgling firm. Essential may shake up the smartphone industry and could potentially give Samsung and Apple their first real competitor -- at least when it comes to taking away market share. Industry vets, including Jason Mackenzie, who served as HTC's global vice president before departing HTC in January, will be Essential's head of sales. Brian Wallace, who worked at Magic Leap, Samsung and Google, will serve as head of marketing. Jason Keats, who served as the lead architect on the iPad and as a senior product designer at Apple, is on board as the head of product architecture. Rubin's tweet suggests that the company is nearing a final unveiling and, likely shortly thereafter, a major launch. Rubin would be wise to get this out the door after the Galaxy S8 hits the market sometime in April and before Apple introduces the iPhone 8 in September.

Apple releases 2011 Supplier Responsibility report Apple unveils supplier names with 2012 responsibility report Video Review: How do the BeatsX compare to the AirPods? Apple takes environmental sustainability seriously, but producing electronic devices that don’t cause harm to the earth or the people who make those devices requires the efforts of Apple’s suppliers, too. That’s why the company enforces standards for its partners, and according to Apple’s 11th annual supplier sustainability progress report, 2016 saw dramatic improvements. Apple audited 705 suppliers and found 98 percent compliance with a 60-hour maximum work week, a new high. Apple removes partners from its supply chain who don’t meet its standards for labor and human rights, and in 2016 the company ceased working with three suppliers, BuzzFeed reported. Apple also cut out 22 suppliers who were found to smelt conflict minerals. Smartphones use many minerals, including gold, tungsten, tantalum, and tin, that can be sourced from conflict zones where the mining and sale of those minerals contributes to human rights abuses. The U.S. is considering suspending regulations that require companies to disclose whether their products include such minerals, but Apple is committed to keeping conflict minerals out of its devices, regardless of the current administration’s policies. “We’ve been really clear with our suppliers that, notwithstanding any changes to regulations—or deregulation, if you will—we’ll continue to run the same program we’ve been running for the last six years,” Paula Pyers, Apple’s senior director of supply chain social responsibility, told BuzzFeed. “We will continue to drive third-party audit programs. We’ll continue to dig really deep, and stand up accountability and our incident report system. Candidly, we don’t plan any change in that which we are doing.” Apple is also expanding its sourcing to include cobalt. The company also tripled the number of supplier sites included in its energy efficiency program, which it said reduced more than 150,000 metric tons of carbon emissions. And despite changes in the American political climate, Apple will continue to focus on sustainability and responsibility—whether or not it’s required. “We’ll continue to call for collective action because we truly believe, whether it’s regulated or self-regulated, this is the way business should be run, and the way we’ll continue to run our business,” Pyers told BuzzFeed.

Users still receive notifications (including haptics) while in Theater Mode, which they can view by tapping the screen or pressing the Digital Crown.

Here’s how Apple describes the TV app that was introduced in December: Watching TV has quickly become all about apps. And now, with the new TV app, you have one place to access shows and movies from multiple video apps — in one unified experience. The TV app lets you see all the movies and shows you’re watching. Find upcoming episodes. Get recommendations for new things to watch. See your entire iTunes video collection. You can even start watching a movie or show directly from the TV app. All without switching between individual apps. Single Sign-on is a separate feature introduced in December that lets users easily authenticate with a supported TV provider once, then access paid video apps that support the feature.

To install the update, the Apple Watch must have at least 50 percent battery, it must be placed on the charger, and it must be in range of the iPhone. An iPhone running iOS 10 or later is required to download the new software, but it is available for all Apple Watch models. watchOS 3.2 introduces Theater Mode, which is designed to let Apple Watch owners mute the sound on their device and disable Raise to Wake, preventing the screen from lighting up with arm movement. Apple Watch users are still able to receive haptic feedback-based notifications, and incoming information can be viewed by pressing down on the Digital Crown or tapping on the screen. The update also brings SiriKit to the Apple Watch, letting users ask Siri to do things like send messages, send payments, book a ride, log a workout, make a call, or search through photos. SiriKit has been available on iOS devices since the release of iOS 10, but is new to the Apple Watch.

Rating: 10 Votes Phogro 1 day ago at 11:23 am Theatre Mode is definitely not new. On older versions before watchOS 3.2 go to settings and go to general then select wake screen then switch the toggle off on Wake Screen on Wrist Raise and now I am able to see the time every time I press on the screen or Digital Crown. Yep. This has always been a feature. However this is not what theater mode is. Theater mode is specifically related to the quick toggle button that they've added to the control center of the watch face allowing you to perform the action you're talking about quickly and easily without having to do multiple taps.

Rating: 2 Votes roncito 1 day ago at 11:19 am An apparent and aggravating bug in the installer… it threw up a message saying that I had to have the watch on the charger anytime it's under 50%... yet, my watch was at 89%. I was not allowed to proceed until I put my watch on the charging cable. Now I have to wait... You always have to have the watch on the charger to update the software Rating: 2 Votes bluespark 1 day ago at 11:16 am Ummm...the theater mode icon isnt in that picture you just posted!!! Thus his statement that "it hasn't" previously been a feature. Rating: 2 Votes bizzy045 18 hours ago at 07:10 pm What ? I've always been able to toggle off raise to wake. This theater mode is just one swipe and a tap, and also mutes the sound. It's much faster this way instead of fumbling through settings in app or on watch. Rating: 2 Votes MrGimper 1 day ago at 11:26 am Theatre Mode is definitely not new. On older versions before watchOS 3.2 go to settings and go to general then select wake screen then switch the toggle off on Wake Screen on Wrist Raise and the screen lights up and I'm now able to see the time every time I press on the screen or Digital Crown and this is on watchOS 3.1 Theatre mode IS new. What it does may not be (it combines 2 steps, disabling raise to wake, and invoking silent mode) Much simpler than faffing through the settings.... Rating: 2 Votes slappypig 1 day ago at 12:10 pm I'm not sure what theatre mode does which cannot already be done. True. I see it more as a convenience feature \ shortcut. To turn off raise-to-wake requires button push and 3 taps and also there is knowing where to go for that option. Theatre mode requires a single swipe up from the bottom and tap once. Rating: 1 Votes dearfriendx 23 hours ago at 01:50 pm Yes it does, overall capacity changed from 5.6 to 5.8 gigabytes, just as the overall capacity of iOS devices slightly increased. I was wondering this myself so I took a screenshot of my watch about screen before updating. Are you sure watchOS 3.2 has APFS added? I haven't found any literature online saying so aside from this comment. Rating: 1 Votes airdrummingfool 20 hours ago at 05:16 pm Airplane mode fixed? When I turn airplane mode on, on iPhone, airplane is on watch. However I turn airplane off on phone, watch stays in airplane mode :( I don't think there can be a fix for this - when the Watch is in Airplane Mode, all wireless communication is disabled, so the iPhone doesn't have a way to tell the Watch to disable Airplane Mode.

A longer swipe on the Siri remote activates the new scrolling mode, and a swipe on the right side of the remote allows users to navigate specific indexes. While Apple's release information only focused on the new scrolling mode, the update also likely includes other small feature tweaks under-the-hood bug fixes and performance improvements.

The update can be downloaded using the Software Update function in the Mac App Store. macOS Sierra 10.12.4 brings iOS's Night Shift mode to the Mac for the first time. Night Shift, first introduced on iOS devices in iOS 9.3, is designed to gradually shift the display of a device from blue to a subtle yellow, cutting down on exposure to blue light. Blue light is believed to interrupt the circadian rhythm, disrupting sleep patterns. Night Shift is activated through the Displays section of System Preferences, where a setting to have it come on at sunset and turn off at sunrise is available. It can also be set to turn on and off at custom times. Night Shift can also be toggled on manually using the Notification Center or Siri. The 10.12.4 update focuses primarily on Night Shift, but the update also includes dictation support for Shanghainese, cricket score integration for Siri, improved PDFKit APIs, and new iCloud Analytics options. Update: Apple has also released a new 2017-001 security update for OS X Yosemite and OS X El Capitan.

Beyond that, a welcome update. :) To be fair, APFS has been. in macOS 10.12 from the beginning, albeit in "developer" quality implementation (e.g., command line commands to reformat disk into APFS, no in-place migration, external volumes only, backward compatibility issues between volumes formatted with 10.12.0 and 10.12.1). I would love to see Disk Utility get APFS support, but other than that, macOS won't get full APFS until 10.13. [doublepost=1490635326][/doublepost] Don't care at all about night shift. Do care about bug fixes especially in safari and custom keyboard shortcuts hopefully those are packed in there Night Shift works considerably smoother than f.lux so I welcome it.

Xcode 8.3 with support for Swift 3.1, iOS 10.3, macOS Sierra 10.12.4, tvOS 10.2, and watchOS 3.2 is also available today. As a major 10.x update, iOS 10.3 includes both significant additions and more minor design tweaks and changes. The biggest new consuming-facing feature is "Find My AirPods," which has been added to the Find My iPhone function to help AirPods owners locate a lost earphone should one be misplaced. Find My AirPods can play a sound to help users find an AirPod misplaced nearby, and it also saves the last known location of when an AirPod was connected to an iOS device via Bluetooth, but it can't locate the AirPods when the iPhone isn't nearby nor can it locate the Charging Case. iOS 10.3 introduces a new Apple File System (APFS), which is installed when an iOS device is updated. APFS is optimized for flash/SSD storage and includes improved support for encryption. Other features include snapshots for freezing the state of a file system (better for backups), space sharing, and better space efficiency, all of which should result in a more stable platform. Customers updating to iOS 10.3 should first make a backup given that the update installs a new file system. Some App Store changes are coming in iOS 10.3, allowing developers to respond to customer reviews for the first time. iOS users are also able to label reviews in the App Store as "Helpful" or "Not Helpful" for surfacing more relevant review content, and Apple plans to limit the number of times developers can ask for a review. The update even adds a master switch that lets customers turn off app review request prompts all together. Other new features in iOS 10.3 include a revamped open/close animation for apps, an Apple ID profile in Settings, a better breakdown of iCloud storage usage, warnings about outdated apps that may not work with future versions of iOS and could slow down devices, HomeKit support for programmable light switches, improvements to SiriKit (bill paying, bill status, and scheduling future rides), CarPlay interface improvements, and iCloud analytics options. Apple's complete release notes for the update are below: iOS 10.3 introduces new features including the ability to locate AirPods using Find my iPhone and more ways to use Siri with payment, ride booking and automaker apps. Find My iPhone - View the current or last known location of your AirPods - Play a sound on one or both AirPods to help you find them Siri - Support for paying and checking status of bills with payment apps - Support for scheduling with ride booking apps - Support for checking car fuel level, lock status, turning on lights and activating horn with automaker apps - Cricket sports scores and statistics for Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council CarPlay - Shortcuts in the status bar for easy access to last used apps - Apple Music Now Playing screen gives access to Up Next and the currently playing song’s album - Daily curated playlists and new music categories in Apple Music Other improvements and fixes - Rent once and watch your iTunes movies across your devices - New Settings unified view for your Apple ID account information, settings and devices - Hourly weather in Maps using 3D Touch on the displayed current temperature - Support for searching “parked car" in Maps - Calendar adds the ability to delete an unwanted invite and report it as junk - Home app support to trigger scenes using accessories with switches and buttons - Home app support for accessory battery level status - Podcasts support for 3D Touch and Today widget to access recently updated shows - Podcast shows or episodes are shareable to Messages with full playback support - Fixes an issue that could prevent Maps from displaying your current location after resetting Location & Privacy - VoiceOver stability improvements for Phone, Safari and Mail Related Roundup: iOS 10 [ 288 comments ] Top Rated Comments (View all) braddick 1 day ago at 09:56 am Sweet!

Apple is reportedly “stepping up” in the development of AR glasses by allocating more resources in its augmented reality efforts that will switch the project from research to making an actual consumer device, sources familiar with the company's plan told the Financial Times. However, you shouldn’t expect the product any time soon. Apple may launch the AR device at least a year from now or much later, the report said.

The social media company is researching technology that can make what CEO Mark Zuckerberg called in February : “glasses small enough to take anywhere.” Apple and Facebook are preparing to compete with start-up Magic Leap and Microsoft’s HoloLens. Magic Leap is expected to release it AR glasses later this year, which could be priced at $1,000. The eyewear is supposedly smaller than Microsoft’s HoloLens, but with a wider field of view, the report said. Apple’s boost in AR efforts come after previous reports on the company’s interest in augmented reality. Last month, a report said Apple has 1,000 engineers in Israel  working on AR technology, which could be integrated into the upcoming iPhone 8.

Apple also made numerous AR-related acquisitions, including Prime Sense, a 3D sensing company, German AR company Metaio, and RealFace, which focuses on facial recognition. Apple CEO Tim Cook’s interest in AR over virtual reality has also been clear. He has previously said he preferred AR over VR, because it allows people to be more "present." Related Stories Siri Vs.

Don't Miss: It’s probably time to admit the Galaxy S8 design is better than Apple’s iPhone 7 design According to the report, Apple began investigating the feasibility and utility of developing smart glasses a little bit more than a year ago. Presumably, Apple’s initial research in the area has been promising because the company is now eyeing the possibility of “taking it from a science project towards a consumer product.” As its engineers have become more adept at miniaturisation technology with products such as its AirPods wireless headphones and the iPad’s Pencil, AR seems to have overtaken Apple’s secretive car project as the company’s top priority for its next big launch, beyond the iPhone. Previous reports have said that Apple’s AR research team now boasts hundreds of researchers and engineers with broad experience in fields like Augmented Reality, head-mounted displays, optics and more. As a prime example of the talent Apple is attracting and bringing in-house, Apple last year hired Zeyu Li, a vision algorithm engineer from Magic Leap. It’s also worth noting that Apple CEO Tim Cook has been uncharacteristically effusive when discussing the potential for augmented reality. Given how notoriously tight-lipped Apple tends to be when it comes to discussing new technologies, Cook’s willingness to heap unrestrained praise on the technology is definitely worth paying attention to. Not too long ago, Cook said that Apple is “high on augmented reality for the long run” and that the technology may ultimately prove to be as impactful as the smartphone itself. In a similar vein, Cook said the following about AR during an interview on Good Morning America about six months ago. “Maybe it’s something we’re talking about,” Cook said, “maybe it’s someone else here that is not here, present, but could be made to appear to be present with us. So there’s a lot of really cool things there.” As intriguing as all of this is, Apple isn’t likely to launch a pair of smart glasses for at least another year. A previous report from Bloomberg claimed that Apple a few months ago placed an order for “small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing” and that a finished product might appear on store shelves as early as 2018. That projection, however, might be a tad too optimistic. Incidentally, Robert Scoble earlier this year claimed that Apple will eventually release a pair of Augmented Reality glasses via a not-so-secretive partnership with Carl Zeiss AG, a reputed German company with decades of expertise and experience in developing a myriad of advanced optical systems.

The firm says that Apple has been working on the project for over a year, but claims that a launch is at least a year away or “perhaps much longer.” Apple first began to build a team to examine the feasibility of a head-worn device more than a year ago. Now, it is devoting more resources to its augmented-reality efforts, with the aim of taking it from a science project towards a consumer product, according to people familiar with the company’s plans. However, any launch is still at least a year away, perhaps much longer. Apple declined to comment. As its engineers have become more adept at miniaturisation technology with products such as its AirPods wireless headphones and the iPad’s Pencil, AR seems to have overtaken Apple’s secretive car project as the company’s top priority for its next big launch, beyond the iPhone. The report says that the startup Magic Leap will beat all of the tech giants to the punch in terms of releasing a pair of augmented reality glasses, which it plans to release later this year. That product will cost around $1000, and will compete with the Microsoft HoloLens. The “light-field” eyewear is said to be smaller than Microsoft’s HoloLens, with a wider field of view, but larger than a regular pair of glasses. The headgear will be tethered to a small pack that provides battery and processing power, to put in a pocket or attach to a belt, and is likely to cost in excess of $1,000. Magic Leap declined to comment. Tags: AR, augmented reality, glasses, wearable About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

By Digit NewsDeskDigit NewsDesk Published Date 27 - Mar - 2017 | Last Updated 27 - Mar - 2017 Tweet   OnePlus 3T (Soft Gold, 6GB RAM + 64GB memory) 29999 Last week, Apple’s plans of kicking off iPhone production in India, starting with iPhone 6 & iPhone 6s, hit a snag as The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) denied Apple’s requests seeking duty exemptions on certain components required for assembling iPhones in India. Even the Finance Ministry has prima facie rejected the Cupertino tech giant’s demands seeking tax and duty concessions. However, a new report by the Economic Times suggests that senior executives from Apple met with an inter-ministerial group recently to discuss the issues related to its plans of setting up iPhone assembly operations in the country. Sources tell the publication that Apple’s demands were discussed at length and that the govt is looking for options to meet those demands. Apple is reportedly asking for concessions to bring its component makers to the country as it cannot source locally from India. Further, it is said that the company seeks duty exemptions on products bought from Special Economic Zones (SEZs). Apple is also looking for relaxations on consumables for manufacturing, service and repairs for a period of 15 years. While the Indian govt may be looking to clear a few of these obstacles for Apple, it cannot give the company all the exemptions it seeks. Undue support to the company can result in other manufacturers seeking similar relaxations, which would ultimately work against the government’s plans of establishing a strong supply chain in the country.

A new report claims that Apple’s primary chip partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. or TSMC, is going to start volume production of the A11 processor in next month. This chip is going to debut with the iPhone 7s and iPhone 8. The Economic Daily news reports that TSMC is going to start volume production of the next iPhone’s processor in April. It’s reportedly going to be built on the 10nm FinFET process. This won’t be TSMC’s first 10nm chip as it has already produced other chips in volume on the same process in the fall last year which were subsequently delivered to customers in the first quarter of this year. The schedule for production and delivery is said to be the same as it was for the iPhone 7 since the next iPhone is also expected to arrive in September this year. However, TSMC is believed to deliver 100 million A11 processors before the end of this year, which would be slightly more than the quantity it delivered for the A10. TSMC is said to be aiming at a target of 50 million chips by July this year. The iPhone 8 is expected to be a revolutionary update over its predecessor and there are no reports as yet to suggest that Apple will stray away from its traditional fall release cycle for new smartphones this year.

After more than a year with a team exploring whether producing a “head-worn” device is viable, people with knowledge of the process said the company is devoting more resources to move its “science project towards a consumer product.” The sources said AR has overtaken the company’s secretive “Project Titan” car endeavor as Apple’s top priority for its next big product launch. While Apple’s chief designer Jony Ive told the New Yorker he viewed the user’s face as the “wrong place” to implement the technology, CEO Tim Cook said when done right, AR has the potential to produce something so fundamentally life-changing that “we will wonder, when it does, how we lived without it. Kind of how we wonder how we lived without our phones today.” The sources said any launch is at least a year away, and possibly much longer, disputing earlier speculation that Apple’s collaboration with Zeiss could produce a lightweight pair of AR glasses as early as this year. The Financial Times report is more inline with analyst Ming-Chi Kuo’s prediction that users probably won’t see augmented reality technology from Apple for at least 1-2 years, but to expect the company to “leapfrog” competitors by 3-5 years once they finally enter the market. Magic Leap is planning to release “light-field” glasses later this year that are smaller than Microsoft’s HoloLens but still larger than a regular pair of glasses. The Magic Leap system will be “tethered to a small pack that provides battery and processing power” and cost more that $1,000. With Apple’s usual focus on aesthetics, the company may be waiting to see what its competitors can put on the market and focus on improving the look, feel and built-in software to distinguish its own offering in the wearable AR space. Apple has reportedly devoted hundreds of its engineers to the AR project and already patented a concept for an AR mapping system that would layer map information and directions over live iPhone video, so the company could test its AR software muscle before rolling out actual wearables.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Magazine Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit Warren Report The Truth About Trump’s Print Media Fixation Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Warren Report The Truth About Trump’s Print Media Fixation For all his media bashing, the outer-borough president still craves establishment acceptance. (A version of this column originally appeared on Poynter.org.) by James Warren, Chief Media Writer, Poynter.orgMarch 27, 2017 11:45 am Email Facebook Twitter Trump derides the "failing" New York Times but craves its support. By Mark Wilson/Getty Images. So when President Donald Trump raised the white flag on Obamacare Friday, did he pick up the phone and gave the exclusive to Breitbart, The Daily Caller or LifeZette? Nope. He called reporters at The Washington Post and The New York Times. But you'd have thought that reaching out to ideological sympathizers was inevitable, given the journalistic sturm und drang about the incursions of right-leaning media in these early days of a new Washington era. The mainstream, especially in the White House press corps, is unsettled by the rise of inexperienced, unworthy newbies. The Washington Post has even announced an Access Watch feature to detail who gets the inside track on certain matters, such as the little-known conservative newsroom that was the sole outlet on Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's government plane to Asia recently. Well, any chronicle of access will need to include the capital's longtime home teams, with Friday's carefully served bulletins from the Trump News Service suggesting how a mix of old media clout, old-fashioned journalistic quality and Trump's own Queens-bred craving to be accepted by various establishments may be more enduring than many assume. Lots of access will continue to be possessed by the very same people who've always had it and whose professional values very much include access, even if at times it may mean merely access to get lied to by politicians and their emissaries. So it was worth it Sunday to ask Mark Knoller, the CBS News White House reporter who keeps detailed records on everything White House-related. When it comes to interviews through March 23, here's whom Trump has accommodated so far. It's a total of 18 interviews, which include Friday's telephonic reaching out: The New York Times (two interviews), ABC (one), Fox News (five), Christian Broadcasting Network (one), Westwood One (one), Israel Hayom (one), NBC (one), Reuters (one), Breitbart (one), Local TV (two), Time magazine (one) and The Washington Post (one). President Barack Obama sat for far more interviews at the same point in his presidency: ABC (four), Al Arabiya (one), NBC (two), CBS (one), CNN (one), Fox (one), Black Enterprise (one), Telemundo (one), a national print roundtable (one), a regional press roundtable (one), radio (four), a columnists roundtable (one), Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (one), USA Today (one), Army Times (one), off-the-record roundtables (three), New York Times (one), ESPN (one), Tonight Show (one) and 60 Minutes (one). While giving fewer interviews, Trump has given one more to The New York Times than Obama so far, one more to Time magazine and one more to The Washington Post. We might include that predilection, if it endures, when chronicling access to him and his minions. As self-appointed Washington cultural historian Joe Scarborough opined this morning on Morning Joe, "The press always wins." (With characteristic modesty he also informed, "I said it to Obama's people, I said it to Bush's people, I said it to Trump's people," in case we forgot.) And don't expect the dynamic to change dramatically, even as Sean Spicer's daily briefings, or Trump press conferences, include recognizing outlets deemed outliers by the media club accustomed to a de facto monopoly derived from self-perceived professional virtue. As Bill Kristol, founder of The Weekly Standard, put it Sunday about Trump: "He's always understood the power of and craved acceptance by the mainstream media." Adds Rich Lowry, editor of National Review: "He hates the mainstream media—and loves the mainstream media. No president has ever followed his news coverage so closely or cared about it so much." Netflix, the new content monster The weekend's best media story was the Wall Street Journal profile of how Netflix is gobbling up executive and artistic talent, spending a stunning $6 billion on original and acquired programming in 2017 and inspiring awe, even dread among competitors. (Journal) What does $6 billion mean? It's "more than double what Time Warner Inc.'s HBO spends and five times as much s 21st century Fox's FX or CBS Corp.'s Showtime. It spent close to $10 million an episode on 'The Crown,' a lavish period drama about Queen Elizabeth II." How does it pull this off? It's partly ongoing increases in subscribers worldwide (now 94 million, up 5.1 million abroad alone in just the last quarter). But it's also done a lot of borrowing, "increasing its debt burden more than 17-fold since 2012 from $195.8 million to $3.4 billion." Still, it's walking a tightrope, needing to maintain good relations with firms whose movies and reruns for which it cuts deals. And it's some of those firms who aren't happy campers, all the more so as it dramatically hikes pay for talent and starts producing original cooking, lifestyle and children's programming. Mike Bloomberg's take In case you miss it the first time, Bloomberg's home page this morning promoted an op-ed by the boss on the health care debacle twice. Stop Blaming. Start Governing. Again, in case you miss it at the top of the page before you email him kudos. (Bloomberg) An Apple legal win "Apple has bigger fish frying in the world of intellectual property. But it must be a relief that an IP court in Beijing has handed the smartphone pioneers a win. On Friday, the courts overturned a May 2016 ruling that said Apple had violated design patents of a small, and now defunct, Chinese company called Shenzhen Baili." (TechCrunch) The disputes were over the exterior design of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models, which Baili claimed were a copy of their 100C smartphones, curved corners and all. The company “barely existed” at the time it filed the suit. And its 100C smartphones were impossible to find. The Pulitzer Center? Big winners in the Overseas Press Club awards competition? Try the Washington-based nonprofit Pulitzer Center, which is 10 years old and funds exactly the sort of international reporting that mainstream organizations have cut back on and need help supporting. It offers help, such as British freelancer Iona Craig's recent Intercept disclosure about the botched Navy SEAL raid in Yemen. Four winners in the competition are the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (The Panama Papers offshore tax fraud), The New Yorker (War Crimes in Syria), The Virginia Quarterly Review (the ungoverned wilds of the Central African Republic) and the Huffington Post (The 21st Century Gold Rush, on exploring the migration crisis). They all won for major pieces in some fashion subsidized by the Pulitzer Center. Want to know about an impressive, 10-year-legacy in which the Washington-based nonprofit has supported 715 separate projects, a total of 6,168 stories in various outlets and dealt with 571 publication partners? Check out this Poynter article of mine. "The Pulitzer Center has become a cornerstone of American journalism," says Nick Schifrin, special correspondent with PBS NewsHour who's benefited from its support of his own labors in Kenya, Eastern Europe, Mexico and Cuba. Iona Craig is a prototypical freelancer, based outside London, who is a Pulitzer beneficiary and used their help in doing her danger-filled Yemen expose for The Intercept. She made clear her gratitude in an interview. Shenkman's new home Journalist-historian Rick Shenkman has found a new home for the History News Network, namely George Washington University, meaning "its future is now assured" after departing George Mason University. It's a lively site that mostly consists of op ed by historians on current events and, I can attest, can be help to daily newsies looking for context. Shenkman says it draws about 700,000 pageviews per month. George Washington won't provide funding but he strongly suspects the affiliation will help him find dough. Want to get a take on the divergent views of Trump and John F. Kennedy on the arts and humanities? It's all part of the current fare on HNN. The right to be forgotten A proposed bill in the New York state legislature would require "search engines, indexers, publishers and any other persons or entities which make available, on or through the internet or other widely used computer-based network, program or service, information about an individual to remove such information, upon the request of the individual, within thirty days of such request." Or it would have required that since the Media Law Resource Center tweets, "Sponsor of NY right-to-be-forgotten bill strikes enacting clause. Even if it passes, it won't become law." (MLRC) Jimmy and Dan The New York Times' digital Times Insider feature can sometimes be very good, sometimes more self-aggrandizing, but a good one was penned by Dan Barry in the wake of the passing (and his obituary of) Jimmy Breslin. They were largely remarks he'd penned at a Breslin tribute long ago and involved the famous columnist calling the reporter out of the blue. He knew that Barry was undergoing cancer treatment and simply offered to go with him. Out of the blue. They weren't friends, even if Barry was a huge fan dating to his childhood. And Breslin accompanied him. (Barry). "The next day, I’m walking around Manhattan, feeling sorry for myself. Jimmy Breslin calls me: Whatta ya got for tomorrow? I got nothing, I say. What with the procedure and all..." "Screw that! he says. Look around you! Stories everywhere! Write it!" Headline of day (sorry, Jake Gyllenhaal) The fictional NASA in Life is run by a bunch of psychopaths and idiots. (The Verge) Twitter, spandex and United Airlines Peter Kafka of Recode does a nice job in Twitter, United Airlines and girls in spandex leggings: How your Sunday #content gets made. It details the modestly sourced stories that appeared everywhere over the weekend when United supposedly barred women from boarding a flight because of their attire. It also noted how it all proved a wee bit more complicated and involved United rules about the attire of those using employee passes (which are different than for normal travelers). Koppel v. Hannity It was a mini-epic tussle, infused with the combatants' respective sense of ample self-importance, as Ted Koppel interviewed and skewered Sean Hannity on CBS' Sunday Morning. (CBS) “Do you think we’re bad for America? You think I’m bad for America?” said Hannity. “Yeah,” said Koppel “You do? Really?” “In the long haul I think you and all these opinion shows —” “That’s sad, Ted. That’s sad.” “No, you know why? Because you’re very good at what you do, and because you have attracted a significantly more influential —” “You are selling the American people short.” Koppel finished his interrupted sentence, "You have attracted people who are determined that ideology is more important than facts.” And, with that, a righteous Koppel won the face-off with the arrogant ideologue and Trump shill. Tronc boardroom follies Newspaper industry analyst Ken Doctor has reported extensively on boardroom melodrama at Tronc, which used to be Tribune Publishing, including a Gannett deal imploding, a failed bid for US Weekly and now boss Michael Ferro undermining his key partner, Los Angeles billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong in a "rat's nest of corporate intrigue" that might intimate a Ferro desire to go private. Regardless, what's largely lost is the editorial languor at most of the properties. While The New York Times, Washington Post and others try to raise their games, especially given the Trump-driven historic politics of the moment, there is no sign that Ferro is moving to do anything vaguely similar. As Doctor noted, the Los Angeles Times, which clearly remains the best in the group (having read it last week rather closely), "does good, steady professional work" but like the others has not been given the resources or a corporate signal to raise its game. To read the L.A Times, Tribune and Sun is to see the widening of a gaping gulf with papers they once felt were peers in New York and Washington. It's unclear whether the key Tronc leaders, who don't have journalism backgrounds, have the visceral understanding of same, or seemingly care like a Jeff Bezos. The price of economic "revival" Check out Inside Alabama’s Auto Jobs Boom: Cheap Wages, Little Training, Crushed Limbs: The South’s manufacturing renaissance comes with a heavy price. And it's not found in Mother Jones or The Nation. It's in Businessweek and a nice job by reporter Peter Waldman. (Bloomberg) AirBannonnB Where exactly does Steve Bannon live and pay taxes? It's an ongoing curiosity, with the latest exploration by USA Today raising doubts about his letting Breitbart use a Washington townhouse zoned for residential. (USA Today) Reporter Paul Singer checked local property records and find the building "is owned by Moustafa El-Gindy, a former Egyptian member of Parliament who has occasionally been quoted in Breitbart news stories. El-Gindy is receiving a homestead deduction on the property, a $72,000 tax credit that requires the owner to maintain residence in the building. He could not be located for comment on this story." Breitbart CEO Larry Solov has indicated to the Senate press gallery, which oversees requests for Hill press credentials, that Breitbart possesses an expiring lease in the building "for corporate housing, offices and entertainment." But, again, the area is zoned only for residential. The lease isn't public. Van Gogh, Monet and Wolf Blitzer On vacation last week, I ambled about the wonderful Getty Museum in Los Angeles with my family and segued from a one-hour tour on Impressionism to a temporary exhibition, Breaking News: Turning the Lens on the Mass Media, an engrossing (really) look at modern artists whose works have been inspired by the press, in particular newspapers, TV news and magazines starting in the 1960s. (Poynter) For example, there's "CNN Concatenated" (2002), the handiwork of Israeli Omer Fast, who edited video so that many then-CNN hosts and correspondents (such as Blitzer, Christiane Amanpour, Judy Woodruff and Kelly Wallace) speak only one word apiece but suggest actual personal conversations playing out among themselves. There's way more, including The Dictator, a 1978 video parody of a 60 Minutes type news magazine show in which a fictional overthrown Latin American tyrant (whose five wives all mysteriously died) is interviewed by a Lesley Stahl-like correspondent. Bottom line: "Colonel Riccardo Garcia Perez" still comes off as a rather appealing character ---a bit like Alec Baldwin's Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live, whose Trump parody makes a similar point about mass media partly shaping perceptions of public figures. "60 Minutes" on Garland, Texas attack The opening segment on the real 60 Minutes was the unsettling tale of a terrorist attack outside a Prophet Muhammad cartoon contest in suburban Dallas in 2015. Fronted by Anderson Cooper, it made much of the fact that an undercover FBI agent was apparently tailing the two terrorists and kept driving by as they shot it out with cops. It left the impression that this was all very new. It wasn't. The thrust of the entire piece broken last month by Associated Press reporter Jacques Billeaud. Here it is. Scott Pelley was stronger on the roots of fake news, while a feature on the impact of chess on a dinky Mississippi county was endearing. The morning babble The Monday-after quarterbacking on the health care bill was in overdrive this morning and included this sweeping gem from Fox & Friends sub co-host Pete Hegseth: "The swamp is deep, it's not going to change instantly...the special interests, the pettiness, the messiness of Washington is never going to change, so you better have the votes and the people behind you to get it done or you will get caught up in the muck." CNN's New Day included co-host Chris Cuomo pre-breakfast literary analogy to Edgar Allan Poe's The Tell-Tale Heart, somehow likening an unnamed narrator claiming sanity while detailing a murder as akin to Republicans who brought down the ill. Got it? Anyway, both it and Morning Joe also welcomed Rep. Ted Poe of Texas in from a GOP storm as a guest since he quit the House Freedom Caucus after the vote. And Joe Scarborough of Morning Joe chucked aside his reflexive modesty and inhibition to tell Trump what he has to do next: Flatten the tax code and lower corporate tax rates for many. "This is easy. If you start with 'Chuck (Schumer), what do you need. Mitch (McConnell), what do you need?' Yo don't start with Heritage Action," he said, the conservative group with which he personally sympathizes. And this: "The stupidity of Steve Bannon knows no ends. If they had somebody at the White House who actually knew how Washington works then this wouldn't have ever happened. See Bannon needs to run a Super PAC. He's an idiot when it comes to how Washington works....He blew this." The failed GOP health bill It's moot now. But buried in the Republican attempt to gut Obamacare, and previously unpublicized, is how Anxiety Disorders Induced By Trump Presidency Not Covered Under GOP Health Bill.

According to a new report, Apple is now “stepping up its efforts” by setting aside more resources for development with the idea of eventually shifting it from a research project to an actual consumer product. The Financial Times reports today that Apple’s augmented reality glasses project has overtaken Project Titan which is believed to be Apple’s self-driving car project. AR is apparently Apple’s next big priority now after the iPhone. Previous reports suggest that Apple is developing a pair of lightweight augmented reality glasses in partnership with Carl Zeiss. The glasses would need to be paired with another device like an iPhone to be used for the intended purpose. It was claimed that Apple has hundreds of engineers working on this project. However, the company hasn’t really confirmed or denied anything about its augmented reality plans. The report itself claims, citing sources familiar with Apple’s plans, that even though development activity has picked up a retail launch of such a product may be more than a year away.

Credit: Apple More like this How Apple will make you really, really want an Apple TV Apple’s March iPad Pro event – What to expect Apple ARM’s for battle Video Mingis on Tech: Self-driving cars, wireless charging -- and Wi-Fi lightbulbs? TSMC will begin churning out Apple’s next generation A11-series processors for the next-generation iPhone in April, local reports claim, confirming December speculation from BlueFin Research Partners. Speed and efficiency Apple develops its own bespoke version of an ARM reference chip for iOS processors. Apple’s existing 64-bit A10 series chip is manufactured using 16 nanometer process, so it’s reasonable to assume the new A11 will deliver significant performance gains on the basis of the move to 10nm alone, presumably without impacting battery life. In 2015, TSMC claimed its 10-nanometer technology will provide a "20% speed gain and 40% power reduction" relative to 16-nanometer technology. Apple’s focus on making developers ship 64-bit apps reinforces the importance of performance on iOS. [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] FinFET As well as a move to 10 nanometer process design, today’s report claims the A11 is assembled using TSMC’s  FinFET (fin field-effect transistor) process “packed with a wafer-level integrated fan-out” technology. I did a little digging and note that TSMC has previously claimed the tech can deliver thinner chips that are at least 20 percent faster with 10 percent better power dissipation. An Applied Materials report in 2015 called FinFET (which is also being deployed by other chip manufacturers), “the biggest thing to hit the semiconductor industry since immersion lithography and high-k dielectrics”. This isn’t new to iPhone: Apple relied on TSMC’s FinFET process for the processors inside iPhone 7, iPhone 6s, iPhone SE, and iPad Pro, previous reports claimed. Know your history It is worth pointing out that Apple’s A10 series processor provided 40 percent greater CPU performance and 50 percent better graphics performance than we saw in the preceding A9 processor. Look at Apple’s history and you’ll see impressive performance gains in each A-series chip transition: A8 to A9: Apple claimed 70 percent improvement in CPU performance and a 90 percent in graphics performance. A7 to A8: Apple claimed a 25 percent improvement in CPU performance and 50 percent improvement in graphics performance. A6 to A7: Apple claimed the A7 delivered twice the CPU and graphics performance. The A10 processor remains the world’s best mobile chip, and while there’s no way to predict what performance gains the A11 will provide, the potential seems promising – a transition to 10nm manufacturing alongside Apple’s customary architectural enhancements mean it’s becoming even less like hyperbole to call the processors inside iPhones “desktop class”. iPhone’s 7s, 7s Plus, and 8 New chips will appear across Apple’s product range this year, though there are some who seem to think new iPads will simply use an A10X chip, a souped-up version of the processor used in current iPhones. The A10X is crazy fast – just look at these leaked performance benchmarks from last year and then think how much more you can expect from A11… Testing? It is worth noting that previous reports have claimed TSMC began shipping 10nm chips to clients in Q1 2017, and while we don’t know if Apple is one of these, it’s safe to surmise it has had at least a few of these new processors in for testing. It’s even possible that some of the iOS 11 Web traffic some Websites claim they’ve seen comes from A11 devices tested in Apple’s labs. Scale The report claims TSMC intends making 100 million of the new A11 chips this year, 50 million by July 2017. Apple typically shifts around 70 million iPhones across the holiday quarter. Will its chip partners be able to cope if demand ramps up? Will the post iPhone 6 replacement cycle and high interest in the (potentially AR-capable) iPhone 8 deliver new sales records?

The hacker group had claimed that it has access to “as many as 559 million Apple email and iCloud accounts,” according to Fortune (and Motherboard’s own story). Even if Apple’s systems weren’t breached, this may still be a serous problem. Email-password combinations could have been obtained through a third party (according to Fortune, the compromised account info matches what was exposed in the LinkedIn breach), and in any case, Apple users should take the opportunity to change their passwords. And they should back up their phones (an external hard drive like one of these is safest). As the Fortune story puts it: “Apple customers who secure their iCloud accounts with the same passwords they use on other online accounts—especially ones at LinkedIn, Yahoo, Dropbox, and other sites recently revealed to have suffered big breaches over the past few years—should adopt new passwords that are long, strong, and unique. Many security experts also recommend storing them in a password manager, and activating two-factor authentication, an additional layer of security, where available.” Better to be safe!   ____________________________________________________________ Tried this tip? Let me know in the comments!

Samsung had to recall faulty Note 7 devices (Source: Getty) Arjun Kharpal Phone launches follow a pretty similar pattern: flashy press conference, excitement, pre-orders and the investing world keeping an eye on how well these devices sell. It’s always high stakes for the companies, but the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S8 on Wednesday, and the anniversary edition of the iPhone later this year, could be the most important smartphone launches ever for both companies. That’s because they come at a time when the smartphone market is saturating and after both companies have gone through testing periods. The Galaxy S8, which has been extensively leaked, will be released following the Note 7 scandal last year, in which Samsung was forced to recall and eventually discontinue the handset after several caught fire. The South Korean giant apologised and released a full report on what went wrong in January, but the episode is still fresh in consumers’ minds. At the same time, Samsung Group’s heir-apparent Jay Y Lee was charged by prosecutors over bribery and embezzlement allegations connected to South Korea’s ongoing corruption scandal which led to the impeachment of the country’s President Park Geun-hye. A successful and innovative Galaxy S8 smartphone will be key to shifting attention away from Samsung’s current issues, putting the Note 7 saga to bed, and boosting sales and profit in its mobile division. Read more: Smartphone sales will be up again this year Apple has also had a tough time recently. In its fiscal 2016 results, the US technology giant experienced the first annual revenue decline since 2001, after iPhone sales fell for three consecutive quarters. Many have questioned Apple chief executive Tim Cook’s ability to innovate, pointing to the Apple Watch as the only new product category under his leadership. Meanwhile, talk of driverless cars and augmented reality (AR) – a technology Cook has said could be as big as the smartphone itself – has yet to be translated into any products. The iPhone 7, Apple’s last flagship, got criticised for not being a big enough change from the iPhone 6s. But from recent leaks, the Galaxy S8 and the iPhone anniversary addition, potentially called the iPhone 8, may just be the best devices both companies have ever produced. Samsung’s flagship will have a big screen and new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, while Apple’s smartphone is rumoured to have a new 3-D camera and AR capabilities. Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that the next iPhone will create a “supercycle” for Apple. Read more: Move over Siri: Bixby is Samsung's voice assistant to rival Apple Driving a new wave of users to buy the next flagship devices will also be crucial if Apple and Samsung want their customers to adopt technologies and services that they are staking their future on such as AI and virtual reality. But competition is tough and Huawei is chasing both Apple and Samsung, with the Chinese firm establishing itself as the number three smartphone player in the world. With such high expectations and both companies keen to put recent issues in the past, Samsung and Apple need to deliver with their flagship launches, which can’t be like any other.

We reveal the best you can buy in the UK right now By Chris Martin | 20 Mar 17 What's the best smartwatch you can buy in the UK? Huawei Watch Apple Watch 2 Samsung Gear S2 Fossil Q Founder Samsung Gear S3 Frontier Jump straight to our full best smartwatches chart What's the best smartwatch? The best smartwatch in 2017 is the Huawei Watch, but we also recommend the Apple Watch Series 2 and Samsung Gear S2, and there are plenty of other top Android watches and iPhone watches to choose from. Learn about these smartwatches and more in our best smartwatches chart. These are the best smartwatches on the UK market for iPhone, Android, fitness and more. See also: The best activity trackers 2017. Find the Best Smartwatch Deals. Best smartwatch 2017 UK: Why do I need a smartwatch? There's an interesting theory that smartwatches are to the smartphone what wristwatches were to the pocket watch. Picture the way the average gentlemen used to have to rummage through his pocket for his watch prior to the 20th century - now skip forward 100+ years and the average smartphone user still has to dive into his/her pocket to check their phone. Read: The best smartphones: The best phone you can buy in 2017. The kicker now is that your smartphone holds far more information than a pocket watch ever did, yet all of which is still locked into your pocket. The theory behind smartwatches is not for you to make calls with and speak into, although some can do this, but instead they mainly provide a quick and easy way to check what notifications are on your smartphone, so you can decide whether it's worth delving into your pocket or searching around your bag to fetch your smartphone or not. What smartwatch do I need? There are two type of smartwatch around at the moment: Those with a colourful touchscreen like would find on your phone, and those which combine a regular analogue watch with smart features - we call them 'semi-smartwatches'. The latter we class as a semi-smart device and normally gives you information via a small LCD screen, LEDs or even smaller hands on the watch face. While a fully-fledged smartwatch can do a lot more, the juice guzzling screen results in a short battery life. Semi-smart watches benefit from longer battery life with some even having separate cells for the watch and smart features. If you're an Android user then an Android Wear smartwatch is the obvious choice but it's not necessarily the best for everyone. Google's OS tweaked for wearables also plays nicely with iOS but with cut down functionality so iPhone owners will get more from the Apple Watch. Others have an entirely different system such as Pebble's range of devices and some even work with Windows Phone like the Vector Watch. Samsung is sticking with its own Tizen, too, so there's something for everyone here. Also see: Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear will make all kinds of wearable devices better. What makes a good smartwatch? So when testing for what is the best smartwatch, the important factors to consider are how much of your smartphone's functionalities can it perform, and how well does it handle each task, the final attribute is obviously style - it's still bling after all. You'll also want to make sure it's compatible with your smartphone - some are only for iPhone or Android while others support most phones. Note that Android Wear now has iOS support but the experience is cut down in comparison. Some smartwatches use different software such as the Gear S3 which runs Tizen, Samsung's own OS - it's a legitimate alternative to Android Wear. See also: Android Wear 2.0 release date and new features. As is stands, you'll need to pick a watch with more limited functionality if you want long battery life while ones which can do all sorts will typically last a couple of days. Fitness fans will want to look for a device with a heart rate monitor and built-in GPS, although the heart rate monitors are often poor. We consider the important factors of a smartwatch to be level of notification detail, battery life, style, water resistance, compatibility with a range of devices/smartphones, plus additional features such as microphones and Wi-Fi support so you don't have to connect to a phone for full functionality. With very similar, if not identical, hardware on offer with many of the Android Wear smartwatches, a large part of the decision will come down to design and price. Smartwatch security warning According to a new report titled Friend or Foe? Your Wearable Devices Reveal Your Personal PIN, it isn't at all difficult for a hacker to figure out your PIN or password utilising motion sensor data from your wearable, with researchers getting it right around 80 percent of the time.  Their advice is for us to create a certain kind of noise data, or to input our PINs and passwords using the other hand. But we have to say, we do that anyway... at least those of us who are righthanded. We fix our watch strap to our left arm using our right hand, and enter our PINs and passwords using our right hand. Do you enter your password or PIN using your watch hand? Let us know in the poll below, and scroll down for our list of the 20 best smartwatches. Best smartwatch 2017 UK - best smartwatch reviews 1. Huawei Watch Rating: Reviewed on: 4 November 15 RRP: £289 Although it's pricy, the Huawei Watch is best Android Wear smartwatch on the market with its absolutely stunning design and exquisite build quality. There's still work to be done though as the watch lacks GPS, the heart rate monitor doesn't work very well and the charger is bit fiddly. Read our Huawei Watch review. 2. Apple Watch Series 2 Rating: Reviewed on: 28 September 16 RRP: £369, US$369 Buy from Apple The new Apple Watch Series 2 takes the main complaints about the original - slow operation, lack of GPS, lack of official waterproofing, short battery life - and solves or at least improves them systematically. If you're into fitness tracking with a sprinkling of notifications and superb integration with the iPhone, this is an almost perfect wearable for you... although, being greedy, we'd still like an even better battery life, and the price remains pretty steep. We thought long and hard about whether to give the Apple Watch Series 2 five out of five, and it was a close-run thing. But those two issues are still, just, keeping it from a perfect score. Great wearable, though, and the only one we've seen that feels like it has any chance at all of taking wearables into the mainstream. Read our Apple Watch Series 2 review. 3. Samsung Gear S2 Rating: Reviewed on: 21 January 16 RRP: £249 Based on our time with the Samsung Gear S2, we think it's a sleek smartwatch with an attractive design. It offers fairly standard smartwatch features like fitness tracking, but also includes some rather interesting features including a rotating bezel used for navigating the UI and enhanced app capabilities. At £249, it sits itself alongside the likes of the Moto 360 2, and we think the Gear S2 is a great, if not better option for Android users – especially with a custom, intuitive UI. Read our Samsung Gear S2 review. 4. Fossil Q Founder Rating: Reviewed on: 10 March 16 RRP: £259 Buy from Fossil There's no doubt that the Fossil Q Founder is a well-made and good looking Android Wear smartwatch which is also a competitive price. The hardware on offer is good, although some may miss the heart rate monitor and GPS. As much as we love it, the flat tyre effect of the screen is a big drawback stopping it being really great. Read our Fossil Q Founder review. 5. Samsung Gear S3 Frontier Rating: Reviewed on: 8 December 16 RRP: £349, US$349 Buy from Samsung The Gear S2 arrived on a deserved wave of hype, but for some reason we aren’t overly excited about this new Gear S3 Frontier. The only thing it actually adds is GPS, and at a £100 cost it’ll definitely put some people off. The reduced functionality when not using a Samsung phone is also a turn-off, despite the software being easier and more intuitive than Android Wear. The problem isn’t entirely the S3’s fault, it’s in the inherent limitations of smartwatches. You’ll always need a smartphone to finish the majority of tasks, and added to the fact that this is practically a repackaged Gear S2 means not much new ground has been broken. If you want a smartwatch and can afford to spend £349, this is the one to get. It just isn’t essential. Read our Samsung Gear S3 Frontier review. 6. Motorola Moto 360 Rating: Reviewed on: 4 November 14 RRP: £199, US$220 The Moto 360 is a fantastic smartwatch with excellent build quality, luxurious design and an affordable price tag. However, it's not flawless with one day battery life, a lower resolution screen which is tainted by the black section at the bottom. It will also be too big for some users. Despite the flaws, it's the best smartwatch we've reviewed to date but watch out for the LG G Watch R, Asus ZenWatch and Apple Watch. Read our Motorola Moto 360 review. 7. LG Watch Urbane Rating: Reviewed on: 17 July 15 RRP: £259 There's a lot to like about the LG Watch Urbane with it's handy Wi-Fi connectivity and the welcome new version of Android Wear. Since it's essentially the same device as the G Watch R in terms of hardware, your purchase really hinges on the design. It is expensive and bulky so we can't see it appearing to the masses so the G Watch R is still our recommended choice. Read our LG Watch Urbane review. 8. Sony SmartWatch 3 Rating: Reviewed on: 22 February 17 RRP: £189 The SmartWatch 3's biggest strength is its built-in GPS, but you'll still need a smartphone for driving directions. It's also great to see a standard USB charging port. The transflective screen is a good idea, but in practice battery life is no better than other smartwatches with better-looking screens. Ultimately, unless you're on a fixed budget, the G Watch R is the better choice. If you can't afford that, wait a few months: the price is bound to drop. Read our Sony SmartWatch 3 review. 9. Motorola Moto 360 Sport Rating: Reviewed on: 4 August 16 RRP: £186 Available for under £200, the Motorola Moto 360 Sport is one of the best smartwatches for fitness. You get the some of the regular 360 style in a design which is practical for activities like running. The GPS tracking is accurate but it's shame the same can't be said of the heart rate monitor and we still find the 'flat tyre' on the screen an eyesore. A solid effort but hard-core fitness fans might need something which is more in-depth. Read our Motorola Moto 360 Sport review. 10. Withings Steel HR Rating: Reviewed on: 2 February 17 RRP: £179, US$179.95 Buy from Withings If you’re not fussed about a full on touchscreen smartwatch, the Withings Steel HR is stylish, well-made and offers excellent battery life. We’re glad to see the addition of the heart rate monitor and the screen for smart features, even if they are basic. A great semi-smartwatch for the price. Read our Withings Steel HR review. 11. Microsoft Band 2 Rating: Reviewed on: 4 October 16 RRP: £199 It is very difficult to score the Band 2, because it is such a specific product with a unique feature set. But let's unpack it: it is definitely good value, as the combination of sensors and features is much greater than any comparable product at this price. And it is well made if not the last word in elegance, nor with perfect battery life. If you are looking for a GPS runner's or cyclist's watch it is a good one at a good price, and it also offers the productivity and sleep tracking. And if you want a smartwatch you will like what the Band 2 does, but you may hanker after the ability to compose and send messages. Simply, I don't. I like to wear my dumb watch, and I like for my phone to stay in my pocket rather than on my wrist. So for me the Band 2 is a winner. Microsoft has now discontinued its Band 2, though you might be able to find a bargain online. Read our Microsoft Band 2 review. 12. Apple Watch Rating: Reviewed on: 8 September 16 RRP: £269, US$269 Buy from Apple We can't help but think that Apple has tried to do too much with this first generation Apple Watch. There are so many ways of interacting with it and so many different features and elements to get used to that the learning curve is surprisingly steep. It takes a lot of getting used to, and at times it feels counter-intuitive, something we're not use to with Apple devices. That's why we'd struggle to recommend spending the £299 or more it'll cost you to buy this smartwatch. As is often the case, waiting for the second generation of the Apple Watch is likely to be a wise move, because Apple is going to learn a lot from this first generation smartwatch and from the customers and fans that are using it. Read our Apple Watch review. 13. Misfit Phase Rating: Reviewed on: 16 March 17 RRP: £165, US$175 Buy from Misfit If you feel comfortable spending £165 to get a stylish watch (albeit rather a chunky one) with smart features, and are confident that you won't miss GPS or heart rate monitor, you'll be pleased with the Phase. But for anyone questioning that price tag I'd recommend looking at Misfit's other trackers or waiting for the new Misfit Vapor smartwatch release. Read our Misfit Phase review. 14. Pebble Steel Rating: Reviewed on: 23 October 14 RRP: £179, US$149.99 The Pebble Steel may not have a high-res and colourful screen and the square design may not be for everyone, but we think it's stylish and the display has a retro charm which also provides excellent battery life. A good alternative to Android Wear if that's not your cup of tea. Read our Pebble Steel review. 15. Fossil Q Grant Rating: Reviewed on: 3 August 16 RRP: £165, US$175 Buy from Fossil The Fossil Q Grant is easily the best looking and well made 'semi-smartwatch' we've reviewed. It's both stunning and affordable although the plastic back which shows is a shame. Smart features including customised notifications and activity tracking work well but are fairly basic and limited. Our main issue is the connectivity issues with Android. Read our Fossil Q Grant review. 16. Vector Watch Luna Rating: Reviewed on: 13 October 15 RRP: £299 It's good to see a company approaching the smartwatch differently and we like the design and style of the Vector Watch Luna. A month-long battery life is a real standout point but you'll have to be happy with the retro low-res display as a sacrifice. This is all acceptable but the device falls down when it comes to functionality with poor apps, fitness tracking and notification system. Things are improving over time with software updates but that's not really good enough at this price point. Read our Vector Watch Luna review. 17. Guess Connect Rating: Reviewed on: 16 August 16 RRP: £289 (41mm), £299 (45mm), US$379 (41mm), $399 (45mm) Looks-wise we're not at all keen on the huge, chunky and ostentatious Guess Connect: the Fossil Q Grant has a far subtler and more elegant design, and is less likely to bruise your child's face when you're having a cuddle. But you may disagree, and if you can put up with - or are even charmed by - the Connect's brutal look, there's a strong feature set here to get your teeth into: it feels only a step or two down from a fully fledged smartwatch. With voice commands and the ability to pick up phone calls or have texts read to you, it's head and shoulders above the Fossil for sheer smartness. For features, this is probably the strongest semi-smartwatch we've seen: activity tracking is the only significant chink in its armour. If that's a priority for you, plump for the Fossil Q Grant - which you may want to do anyway because it's also a lot cheaper and (in our view) more attractive. Read our Guess Connect review. 18. Huawei Fit Rating: Reviewed on: 15 March 17 RRP: £106, US$129 There's plenty to like here, from the extremely good battery life and decent water resistance rating to that always-on time display. Heart rate monitors aren't a given in this class of wearable and swim-tracking is an unexpected bonus. And it looks ok, especially if you swap in a third-party strap. But it feels cheap, and perhaps more worryingly, it isn't particularly cheap - the price tag isn't really low enough to compensate for the missing features (such as GPS) or the dim and sluggish display. We also find the watch face options rather poor, offering little useful information. Better deals may and indeed should become available (on Amazon it costs less in dollars than in pounds, which suggests the UK option is overpriced at present) but until then, we'd suggest looking elsewhere.

Check out this list of CBR’s favourite video editing software for Mac, Apple Macs have always been an incredible tool for creative projects, their portability and streamlined interface have ensured that the production of home video, movies and music is a real treat. Advances in connectivity and streaming have made sharing your projects even easier than before, but sometimes it can be tricky to know where to start. There are a multitude of different options available today for the budding filmmaker, whether you’re a hardened professional looking to make your magnum opus, or a new beginner just looking to get vlogging. Either way, to create something smooth you’ll need some software. If you fancy yourself as the next Stanley Kubrick, or even the next YouTube sensation, check out this list of the best video editing software available today!   Apple iMovie Apple iMovie is the home video editing software that comes bundled in with every Mac, but unlike with most pre-installed software, iMovie has helped to set the bar for video editing for at least the last decade. iMovie’s wonderfully simplistic style is probably the biggest selling point that puts ahead of the pack, with drag and drop controls and easily applied after-effects it’s a truly intuitive system. Also, as with many Apple products, the interoperability is something to behold, it’s never been easier to share your projects across different iOS devices with iMovie’s theatre mode. iMovie does have its problems however, for a start it’s not the most complex software on the market and a seasoned veteran might find it lacking in some departments. There are plenty of PC based video editing programmes that can far outpace iMovie also available, but with that said, if you want simplicity and convenience you can’t do much better than iMovie. Apple iMovie is available for £15 on the iOS app store.   Adobe Premiere Elements Adobe Premiere Elements is an excellent middle ground and a strong starting point for anyone looking to getting in to creating and editing videos. Adobe’s video editing software has long been the market leader, largely in part due to its versatility when producing videos for a range of different purposes and standards. Premier Elements is another piece of software in which simplicity is the name of the game, at least at a skin deep level. The programme comes with an exceptionally high number of editing tools designed for both simple creations and complex edits, enabling users to go as shallow or as deep as they need to during their edits. However, if you’re looking for crystal clear picture or 3D rendering you might need something a bit more complex as the programme does not support 4K or 3D. Premier elements may also take some getting used to it at first, as the interface is not quite as intuitive as some of the alternatives, but given a few hours of experimentation you’ll be exporting your projects in no time Adobe Premiere Elements is available from £69.00.   If you have the budget, the next top-of-the-range option might be for you Next Tags Apple mac Macs Sidebar List Software Video video editing Previous ArticleBest Streaming Device Next ArticleBest Ad Blocker: Top 7 Most read Almost half of UK business has NO cyber security plan Tom Ball 27th March 2017 IBM turns dog whisperer with drone that will look after your pets Byomakesh Biswal 27th March 2017 Three, Cisco sign major IoT deal to bring connectivity to global enterprise Ellie Burns 27th March 2017 1 in 4 believe robots would make better politicians Hannah Williams 22nd March 2017 Snapchat IPO gives a glimpse into the power of software James Nunns 21st March 2017 New Gmail Phishing scam trawling for unsuspecting users Tom Ball 17th March 2017 iOS 11 Screenshot Alerts – Rumoured Apple iPhone update probably untrue Joe Clark 17th March 2017 Latest White Papers How Intel IT’s Integrated Analytics Platform Helps Sales and Marketing By Intel Le stockage de demain By Kaminario Overcome the Attacker Advantage with McAfee Endpoint Security By Intel Editor’s Pick Open source software is for everyone – so where are the women?

The company is planning to add iMessage integration for the first time, letting Siri help you write texts by offering predictive suggestions. As 9to5Mac writes, the claims were made in an article by Israeli tech blog The Verifier today. The site reports Apple is planning further improvements to Siri above the features introduced with last year's iOS 10. This time, the company will focus on assisting users to complete common smartphone tasks. Apple will add iMessage integration to Siri, letting the AI help users to create new texts and access advanced messaging features. Details on what the integration will include aren't available but significant clues can be found in an Apple patent filing made late last year. The company has previously described a system that would allow Siri to give suggestions based on the contents of a messaging thread. It could suggest and give directions to restaurants if you're chatting about eating out or provide information on a place that's been mentioned. It's similar to Google Assistant's role in Allo, Google's AI-augmented chat app, and it's likely Apple is attempting to catch-up Google's progress in mobile AI. Apple considerably expanded Siri in 2016 with iOS 10. It now allows developers to add Siri to their own apps, letting you say voice commands to interact with third-party services. The company has aimed to achieve the proactive assistance touted by Google. As Apple prepares to face a new rival in the form of Samsung's upcoming Bixby, the company looks to be readying another Siri upgrade to ensure the assistant remains relevant to users. In iOS 11, Apple will expand Siri's proactive features to allow it to learn from users, The Verifier reports. Siri will be able to study the user's habits and regular patterns, changing the functions offered in response to the activity of the device owner. Everything will be uploaded to Apple's iCloud and synced across devices, preserving context across conversations. You could start an exchange on your iPhone and then resume it on your Mac computer. Cross-device activity resumption is already a strong point for Apple so widening the supported apps to include Siri is a logical next step. Siri's learned information will also be available to tvOS and watchOS devices, effectively letting your data follow you across device boundaries. Apple is expected to unveil iOS 11 at its Worldwide Developer's Conference event this June. Details on the rest of the operating system are currently light. It follows last year's "biggest ever" iOS 10 release which debuted a new streamlined interface and an overhaul of many stock Apple apps, alongside the significant Siri improvements and a myriad of smaller features.

Nexus 6P vs Nexus 5X: The End of An Impressive Era... Vs Michael Grothaus 16:12, 27 Mar 2017 facebook twitter google+ Looking back at the excellent Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P – both of which now have Android Nougat! The decision by Google to nix its Nexus line and focus on selling premium, high-end phones designed within its HQ has been scrutinised to hell and back since the phones were first announced. I was skeptical too… but then I tested the Pixel XL out and it quite literally blew my mind. The handset has an amazing camera, brilliant performance and, best of all, perhaps the best battery life of ANY phone I have ever tested. Nothing can slow this handset down; heavy use yields a solid day and half, while more moderate usage will likely see things progress to two days. Standby is off the charts. Yes, these handsets are expensive. But so too is the iPhone, and this is the market – and consumers – Google is going after. It might take a few years for Google to catch up with Apple, but the quality of these Pixel handsets CANNOT be faulted. As phones they are easily two of the finest specimens ever produced by anyone in the mobile space. Still, if you want still want a Nexus you’re good to go, as the handsets are still available. We’ve even included some deals within this article for the best prices we found online. I still have a Nexus 6P and I still use it from time to time. It works great and will get support for Google for at least another 12 months and once that support runs out it will live on with custom ROMs, so, yes, the Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X, while no longer Google’s darlings, are still very much worthy of investment. For now though, let's have a look and see how Google's latest Nexus handsets compare. Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P: Specs Here’s the specs for the Nexus 5X: Display: 5.2 inches, FHD (1920 x 1080) LCD at 423 ppi Dimensions: 147.0 x 72.6 x 7.9 mm Weight: 136 grams Storage: 16GB or 32GB Memory: 2 GB LPDDR3 Processors: Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor, 1.8 GHz hexa-core 64-bit, Adreno 418 GPU Front camera: 5 MP, 1.4 µm pixels, f/2.0 aperture Rear camera: 12.3 MP, 1.55 µm pixels, f/2.0 aperture, 4K video Connectivity: Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac 2x2 MIMO, dual-band (2.4 GHz, 5.0 GHz); Bluetooth 4.2; NFC; GPS, GLONASS Colors: Carbon, Quartz, and Ice And here’s the specs for the Nexus 6P: Display: 5.7 inches; WQHD (2560 x 1440) AMOLED display at 518 ppi Dimensions: 159.3 X 77.8 X 7.3 mm Weight: 178 grams Storage: 32GB, 64 GB, or 128GB Memory: 3GB LPDDR4 Processors: Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor, 2.0 GHz Octa-core 64-bit; Adreno 430 GPU Front camera: 8MP camera; 1.4 µm pixels; f/2.4 aperture Rear camera: 12.3 MP; 1.55 µm pixels; f/2.0 aperture, 4K video Connectivity: Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac 2x2 MIMO, dual-band (2.4 GHz, 5.0 GHz); Bluetooth 4.2; NFC; GPS, GLONASS Colors: Aluminium, Graphite, Frost, and Gold (Japan only) There’s no question about it, the Nexus 6P is clearly the better of the two phones from an internal spec point of view. It packs the excellent Snapdragon 810 processor and Adreno 430 GPU along with 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM. It also comes in three storage sizes starting with a respectable 32GB (hey Apple, take note) and includes 64GB and 128GB options. That’s not to say the Nexus 5X is a slouch–it’s a great upgrade over the Nexus 5, but it’s a less premium phone and it shows in comparison with the slower Snapdragon 808 processor and Adreno 418 GPU and only 2GB of LPDDR3 RAM. Plus it only comes in 16GB and 32GB storage options–and no one should buy a 16GB phone; it’s just not enough space. With specs Google has pretty much hit the nail on the head. It has everything you could possibly want and need on both variants but, unlike it did with the Nexus 6, Google has presented another option for consumers that are looking for more value for money. But how do the handsets' differ with respect to performance? Let's dig a little deeper with some analysis of benchmarks that compare the two handsets in question as well as the newer HTC 10 and Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE.  The Nexus 6P is the premium handset. It’s the one Google wants you to buy — the Nexus 6P is bigger, more expensive and decked out with better hardware. But what does this look like inside benchmarks? Is the gap as palpable as the price and marketing would have you believe? Let’s take a look. In Peacekeeper, which is a browser test, the handsets are very evenly matched. But when you consider both use Chrome as their stock web browser, this outcome isn’t surprising at all. This trend is also visible with the Galaxy S7 and HTC 10, which also use the same Android Marshmallow-version of Chrome. Where things start to get different is inside GFX, which puts the handsets’ through intensive graphics performance analysis with game-like content, low-level tests measure specific graphics performance aspects (Driver Overhead 2, ALU 2, Tessellation, Texturing). Here we see the additional grunt of the Nexus 6P paying dividends. Similarly, 2014’s Nexus 6 also puts in a fine performance compared to the newer Nexus 5X, which uses less RAM and the Snapdragon 808 CPU, versus more powerful Snapdragon’s and higher amounts of RAM inside the Nexus 6P. And if you’re interested in what the next-generation performance of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 looks like, simply look two rows down and have a butchers at the HTC 10 — it completely dominates everything in this list, including the Exynos-powered Galaxy S7 EDGE. Interestingly, the Nexus 6 really holds its own when compared to the Nexus 5X despite using an older SoC. What you’re seeing here is the power of having an extra GB of RAM at your disposal — the Nexus 6 has 3GB versus the Nexus 5X’s 2GB. In Geek Bench 3, which is designed to simulate real-world situations, it’s a similar picture: the Nexus 6P beats the Nexus 5X overall, followed by the Nexus 6. The HTC 10 and Galaxy S7 EDGE, on account of their improved processors and higher amounts of RAM, demonstrate their true next-generation status when compared to 2015 hardware with significant all round boosts to everyday tasks and overall performance.   Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P: Display Besides the internal specs, there's two other HUGE differences between the 5X and 6P. Let’s start with the most obvious: the display. The Nexus 5X has a 5.2 inch FHD LCD with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 at 423 ppi. The Nexus 6P, on the other hand, is clearly designed for those who want a phablet. It’s got a 5.7 inch WQHD AMOLED display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 at 518 ppi. Size differences aside, the display on the 6P is superior in every way: from its higher resolution WQHD AMOLED panel to its insane 518 pixels per inch. The 6P also features a Gorilla Glass 4 display, while the 5X uses the older, less durable, Gorilla Glass 3 display. Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P: Design The second major way the 5X and 6P differ is in their design. By now I’m sure you can tell that the 6P is designed to be the “premium” model of the two–it’s meant to take on high class phones like the iPhone 6s and the Samsung Galaxy S6. As a result it’s got a quality all-metal body that is sleek and sophisticated. That metal body also allows for the 6P to actually be thinner than the smaller 5X. The 6P is 7.3mm thick, while the 5X is 7.9mm thick. The 6P comes in four colors: Aluminium, Graphite, Frost, and Gold–though gold is only available in Japan. The reason the 5X is thicker than the 6P is because its body is made of smooth plastic. That won’t be a deal breaker for some, but for those that want the sleekest phone out there, metal bodies are where it’s at. The 5X comes in three colors: Carbon, Quartz, and Ice. Build materials and thickness aside, on the whole both devices are very similar in design and aesthetics, keeping that signature Nexus bodystyle with a smoothly rounded back panel and curvy corners. They're quite pleasant to look at, and little accents such as the Nexus 5X's round camera port and round fingerprint scanner side-by-side do have their charm. On the Nexus 6P, instead you have a large bar shape at the top housing the optics, and this does protrude slightly, while the round fingerprint scanner remains in the same place - while the Nexus 6P may be the more "premium" of the two in terms of build quality it has to be said the back panel is a little less elegant visually. Perhaps more important, though also more obvious, is the sheer size and mass of each device though. Of course we've covered this in the display size section to an extent, but it's also relevant in terms of design and handling properties - without wishing to state the bleeding obvious; the Nexus 6P is a MASSIVE 6in phone, so it's going to feel very different to operate and occupy more pocket space, and to be frank this is not everyone's cup of tea. If you have big hands you might be ok, but otherwise, expect a bit of unweildiness. The Nexus 5X, on the other hand (ha) is your typical 5in size and much more manageable for the average smartphone user. As usual, this comes down to personal preference and just what compromises you're prepared to make for the sake of better handling, or alternatively for things like, say, a massive but beautiful display, metal bodywork, and much better battery life. Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P: Cameras Surprisingly even though both phones have until this point been very different, they are exactly the same in the rear camera department. Both phones feature a 12.3 MP, 1.55 µm pixels, f/2.0 aperture rear camera that shoots 4K video. They both also have dual-LED flash and laser auto-focus. Where the phones differ is in the front camera. The 5X offers a 5 MP, 1.4 µm pixels, f/2.0 front lens, while the 6P bumps that up to a 8MP, 1.4 µm pixels, f/2.4 aperture front lens. However, all is not well in camp Nexus following reports of serious issues with the camera.  The glass seems to break for no apparent reason, and it’s not clear what caused the damage, according to one user on Reddit. “Well that was a surprise. For me, and the cat,” johny_rat wrote on Reddit. It was sat on a table next to me when I heard the glass snap, leaving a little snowfall of shavings on the table under it. It’s now continuing to crack away to itself.” “A different user said he reported the same problem to Google, which directed him to Huawei for future guidance,” notes BGR. “If this is a design issue, it’s likely all affected Nexus 6P will be repaired or replaced. Of course, for some people it might be difficult to prove the screen didn’t crack following an accidental drop.” Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P: Battery & Connectivity As far as connectivity, each phone features exactly the same innards: 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2, NFC, and a USB Type-C connector. The 5X has a smaller battery at 2,700 mAh versus the 6P’s 3,450 mAh battery, but that won’t necessarily translate to longer battery life in the 6P. After all, it’s got a much more power hungry display to run.  In our tests the Nexus 6P had very decent battery performance, even more so when you consider the handset runs a QHD panel. A lot of this is down to the sheer size of the battery cell, granted, but there is also Android Marshmallow’s role to factor; it has a bunch of new power saving features designed to not only extend the battery life of Android phones but also boost their idle performance by quite a considerable margin. Naturally with both phones being sealed unibody devices the battery cells are not removable in either device. The Nexus 6P is the better phone in all regards, including battery performance. In our tests we found the Nexus 6P to rank among the top five handsets of last year for battery performance — it really is that good. Testing battery life in a demonstrable manner is difficult because everybody uses phones differently. I might work a phone harder than, say, your Uncle Tim. But one way of showing how battery’s perform under pressure is through a video-playback test, whereby a video is looped until the phone dies. This is more of an endurance drain-test and, while not representative of everyday use, does give us a good idea of the battery’s overall performance when factor in with our anecdotal findings while roading testing the handset in the real world. And as you can see above, the results aren’t really all that surprising: the Nexus 6P beats the Nexus 5X by quite a margin and the newer HTC 10 and Galaxy S7 EDGE are WAY out in front. Largely, this uplift is down to better CPUs and more efficient software and power management. Still, the Nexus 6P isn’t bad by any stretch of the imagination. It’s just that this year’s phone makers REALLY upped their game with respect to battery life. And that’s something we can all appreciate. Nexus 5X vs Nexus 6P: Price & Verdict The Nexus 5X is £339 for the 16GB model and £379 for the 32GB model. The Nexus 6P is £449 for the 32GB model, £499 for the 64GB version, and £579 for the128GB variant. But as usual, your choice probably won’t come down to price or even internal specs–it will come down to the display size. Do you want a big smartphone (if so, get the 5X) or a massive phablet (then the 6P is your guy). You can now pick up the Nexus 5X for next to nothing on Amazon.  That’s not to say the two phones are similar in other ways–they clearly are not. Spec for spec the 6P is better by a long shot in almost every way. But as I said, most of us buy based on display size–and if you’re like most of us (and you’re only deciding between these two phones) then their size is probably going to be the deciding factor for you.

Augmented reality is now reportedly the most important development project within Apple, after iPhone. The report notes that both Apple with its yet-to-be-announced product and Facebook with its tethered Oculus headset are gearing up to challenge the secretive Florida-based startup Magic Leap and Microsoft, which more than two years ago debuted its praised augmented reality accessory, called HoloLens. Citing people with knowledge of the plans, the report states that Apple a year ago began assembling a team of experts to tackle augmented reality. They’re now devoting more resources to augmented-reality efforts and a rumored head-worn device. Ultimately, Apple wants to take it from a science project towards a consumer product. “Any launch is still at least a year away, perhaps much longer,” reads the report. Augmented reality seems to have emerged as the top new project beyond iPhone, overtaking even the Cupertino company’s secretive car project. According to Apple’s boss Tim Cook, augmented reality may “take a little while” to arrive, but “we will wonder, when it does, how we lived without it.” “Kind of how we wonder how we lived without our phones today,” he said. At the same time, Facebook is researching the technology that can make what its CEO Mark Zuckerberg calls “glasses small enough to take anywhere”. MagicLeap, the secretive Florida-based company, recently raised a whopping $1.4 billion from investors including Alphabet and Alibaba. The startup is planning to release its long-awaited augmented reality eyewear later this year. Smaller than Microsoft’s HoloLens with a wider field of view, the MagicLeap device will be reportedly larger than a regular pair of glasses. “The headgear will be tethered to a small pack that provides battery and processing power, to put in a pocket or attach to a belt,” the newspaper has learned. That device is likely to cost in excess of $1,000.
