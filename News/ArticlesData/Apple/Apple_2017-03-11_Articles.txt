Since then, however, things have changed. Some new details have emerged, some old rumors have been squashed, and more. As we inch closer to the announcement of the tenth anniversary iPhone, we’re starting to narrow down what exactly the device might feature. It can get overwhelming with all of the contradicting reports, so read on for our full, updated breakdown of 2017 iPhone rumors… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Display + Function Area Originally, it was believed that the iPhone 8 would feature a 5.8-inch OLED display. We’ve now learned, however, that some of that display will be taken up by a new function area, making the usable screen real estate somewhere between 5-inches and 5.15-inches, though the display as a whole will come in at 5.8-inches. While there were rumors that Apple would introduce a 5-inch iPhone, it now seems as if those rumors were referring to the same flagship 5.8-inch model, but not counting the function area towards the total screen size. Following a report from KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo, we dove a little bit deeper into the math of the iPhone 8’s screen resolution and came to the determination that the device, if rumors hold true, will feature a 521 pixel-per-inch display. This number is significantly higher than the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhones, which have 325 PPI and 401 PPI, respectively. The area of the screen dedicated to the apps and interface is expected to be 2436×1125, which makes for a 21:9 aspect ratio, roughly. This could spell trouble for watching content that is 16:9, but would bring the iPhone up to par with competing Android phones in terms of screen resolution and pixels-per-inch. In terms of display technology, it is still believed that the iPhone 8 will be the first iPhone to make the jump to OLED. This, however, seems to be one of the most uncertain aspects of the device right now and really depends on Apple’s ability to source enough of the component. As for the function area, it is said to take up the bottom portion of the display and offer navigation buttons and more. Specific details are still somewhat unclear, but it sounds awfully similar to the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pros, allowing for contextually aware buttons and controls. Read below for all of the details we know thus far on the iPhone 8 display and function area: Latest report suggests iPhone 8 screen features higher 521 PPI density, 3x Retina scaling like Plus models KGI: iPhone 8 to feature new ‘function area’ in place of Touch ID, 5.15-inch usable screen space Apple again said to be releasing iPhone 8 w/ 5.8-inch OLED display Report: Apple iPhone 8 to feature plastic, curved, OLED display New profile sheds light on Apple’s push to switch to OLED displays with iPhone 8 Apple reportedly sourcing 5.8-inch AMOLED panels for next iPhone exclusively from Samsung Design Not much has changed in what we expect the iPhone 8 to feature in terms of design. It’s expected to feature an all-glass design with metal casing around the sides, similar to what we saw with the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s. The ideal setup here is the beautiful design of the ‘Jet Black’ iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, but instead of the scratch-prone gloss that it uses, we’ll get a more sturdy glass design. In terms of overall size, it has been said that the iPhone 8 will be around the same physical footprint as the current 4.7-inch iPhone, but that the larger screen is possible because of the nearly bezel-less design that the iPhone 8 will incorporate. We’re still expecting the device to feature 2 cameras on the back, much like the current iPhone 7 Plus. The cameras could, however, be vertically aligned as opposed to horizontally, which would allow for more advanced 3D and sensing technology, but more on that later. Read all of the design rumors for the iPhone 8 below: KGI: OLED iPhone 8 to be similar physical size to 4.7 inch iPhone 7, with significantly larger battery Nikkei: iPhone 8 will introduce 5-inch version, all-glass backs across lineup Apple to revamp iPhone lineup in 2017 w/ iPhone 4-like design, AMOLED screen, 5.8-inch model Apple to drop aluminum iPhone casing in 2017 in favor of new ‘all glass’ enclosure with AMOLED screen KGI: ‘Increasing likelihood’ iPhone 8 will feature glass front and back, stainless steel metal for premium models New report supports glass design for iPhone 8, with iPhone 4-style stainless steel frame Home Button + Touch ID The addition of the function area and nearly bezel-less design means we will likely see the demise of the Home button as we know it this year. Apple paved the way for this change last year with the solid-state Home button, but this year we expect an entirely new embedded Home button. The Home button is expected to be embedded in the display itself, meaning that it will no longer be a separate button at the bottom of the front of the device. As for Touch ID, it seems likely that Touch ID will also be embedded in the display. Apple has a patent that theoretically allows for such a technology. Instead of the capacitive solution that Touch ID uses today, an embedded solution would use ultrasonic imaging technology that is believed to be much more accurate: The most accurate but least common finger-scanning technology is ultrasound imaging. In this type of sensor, two transducers are placed on the x- and y-axes of a plate of glass–one each for receiving and transmitting–for propagating ultrasound waves through a glass plate; when the finger is placed on top of the glass, the finger impedes the waves and the receiving transducer can measure the alteration in wave patterns. This type of scanner is very new and largely untested in a variety of conditions, but initial results show promise for the technology. It combines the large plate size and ease of use of the optical scanners with the ability to pervade dirt and residue on the scanner, an advantage of capacitive scanners.

Originally, it was widely rumored that the iPhone 8 would feature a long-range wireless charging technology. This would have been a major technological achievement on Apple’s part, but according to more recent reports, the iPhone 8 will feature inductive wireless charging. Most reports have suggested that Apple will sell the wireless charging technology separate from the iPhone 8 itself. This likely refers to something like a charging pad or mat. Even though it is expected to be using an inductive solution, it is believed that Apple has been working on its own inductive solution with Broadcom. It’s unclear how much Apple could potentially sell its wireless charging technology for, but you can read all of the latest wireless charging rumors below: Apple said to be working on wireless charging solution with Broadcom Report claims Apple will sell iPhone 8 wireless charging tech separately Apple joins Wireless Power Consortium/Qi, lending weight to rumor of wireless charging for iPhone 8 Report suggests hopes of Energous-based long-range charging in iPhone 8 may be dashed USB-C or Lightning? Well, both. While one Wall Street Journal report suggested that Apple would make the jump to USB-C with the iPhone 8, that doesn’t necessarily appear to be the case. Instead, it seems like the iPhone will stick to the smaller and proprietary Lightning connector, but rather start including a Lightning to USB-C cable in the box with a USB-C wall adapter. Doing this will allow for owners of recent MacBooks and MacBook Pros to plug their iPhone directly into their laptop, while USB-C charging would also be faster than Lightning to USB-A. There are several reasons as to why Apple likely isn’t switching to USB-C all around this year. For one, regulating USB-C accessories is much harder as it is an open standard. Lightning, however, is Apple’s own standard and thus it can more strictly regulate what type of accessories are produced using the connection. Apple also, of course, collects royalties on all certified Lightning accessories. WSJ: iPhone 8 to replace Lightning connector with a USB-C port KGI reports Apple iPhone 8 will not switch to USB-C, internal upgrades will support fast charging over Lightning 3D Sensing + AR Technology Apple’s plans for 3D sensing and augmented reality are a bit more unclear, but it’s widely believed that Apple has a relatively large team working on the technologies. Apple has also made a number of acquisitions in this area. Most recently, it has been reported that the iPhone 8 will feature a revolutionary 3D-sensing front camera that detects depth for games and facial recognition. This type of technology also lends itself to face recognition for unlocking the iPhone, providing another secure biometric way of doing so. We also recently outlined the two ways 3D depth-sensing could work on the iPhone 8, both of which can be seen in the image above. The first way: The simplest way to sense 3D space is to use what the note calls Time of Flight (ToF). An emitter transmits a signal (for example, in infrared) and times how long it takes to bounce off an object in front of the iPhone and return to a sensor. From a series of timed returns, the iPhone can build up a 3D image of what is in front of it. The other, more advanced, technology: Known as Structured Light, a known pattern such as a grid is projected onto whatever is in front of the iPhone. This grid will be distorted by the 3D shape of the object it hits, and the iPhone can then analyze this deformation to calculate the shape of the object. Tim Cook has continually spoken fondly of augmented reality, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Apple is working diligently on implementing it into the iPhone.

Throughout this post, I’ve referred it as the iPhone 8, but a recent report suggested that it may be called the iPhone Edition instead. We really don’t know and probably won’t know until we get much closer to the fall unveil… As for that fall unveil, it’s believed that Apple will announce the iPhone 8 in September, but that because of the advanced production technology the device will require, it won’t actually hit store shelves until a couple of months after that. According to reports, the 3D sensing technology and OLED display are what’s causing Apple to push the release back. The iPhone 8 is expected to be the most expensive iPhone to date, according to a Fast Company report. The device could come in at above $1000, but that’s not necessarily insane when you take into consideration the monthly payment plans that most smartphones are purchased on nowadays. Report: 3D sensor production ramp suggests iPhone 8 to launch later than September Report: iPhone 8 to feature Lumentum-sourced 3D sensor, launch above $1,000 this fall despite early production rumors Report: iPhone 8 to start mass production in September Report: This year’s flagship iPhone may be called the ‘iPhone Edition,’ launch well after announcement Comment: A flagship iPhone 8 going for $1000+ isn’t as outlandish as it may sound, are you in? [Poll] Wrap Up It seems clear that this year’s iPhone will be the biggest release in the device’s history. With an all-new design, wireless charging, an OLED display, and much more, it looks as if Apple is pull out all of the stops to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the device. Some aspects still remain uncertain, though, and it’s likely that things will continue to evolve and change. As of right now, though, these are the features we’re expecting the iPhone 8, or whatever it is called, to adopt. If the device turned out exactly like we outlined in this post, would it be enough for you to shell out over $1000? Let us know down in the comments.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Fire destroys several sheds, doused before reaching home Saturday Mar 11, 2017 at 5:50 PM Mar 11, 2017 at 5:51 PM By Staff Reports APPLE VALLEY — A large plume of black smoke could be seen in the Fairview Valley area Saturday afternoon after several sheds were engulfed in a fire that was quickly doused, according to Apple Valley Fire Protection District officials. The fire erupted in the backyard of a residence in the 26300 block of Cahuilla Road — in unincorporated northeast Apple Valley — and was reported to authorities at 2:45 p.m., AVFPD Chief Sid Hultquist said. When firefighters arrived, they found multiple wooden sheds, several vehicles, yard debris and several propane tanks fully engulfed in flames, Hultquist said. “Several propane tanks were venting, and there were multiple rounds of ammunition exploding from inside the sheds,” Hultquist said, explaining that although the rounds weren’t exploding at the same velocity as they would when firing out of a gun, there’s still a level of danger posed to firefighters. “There was some life hazard with those things, but our goal was to prevent it from spreading to a motor home and several other trailers on the property, and we were able to do that.” Despite contending with the propane tanks and ammunition, the fire was knocked down in about 30 minutes. The cause of the fire is unknown, and AVFPD officials are interviewing the residents of the property about the incident. “It doesn’t look suspicious in nature,” Hultquist said. A total of three fire engines and nine firefighters plus Chief Hultquist responded. The cost of the fire’s damage has not yet been determined, officials said.   About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Reader Services Contact Us E-Paper Help Subscribe Now Report a Problem Online Services Newsletters/Alerts Archives Story Archive Obituary Archive Photo Archive Advertising Info Advertise with Us Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2017 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Specifically, the blog shared a portion of the App Store URL, otherwise known as a CatalogURL, for macOS 10.13. We were subsequently able to pinpoint the full URL by tweaking an older CatalogURL link, and it appears to be a secure HTTPS link originating from Apple's servers, so the screenshot is legitimate. The full URL: https://swscan.apple.com/content/catalogs/others/index-10.13seed.merged-1.sucatalog.gz We don't know much about what's coming in macOS 10.13 at this point, but visits we're receiving from Macs running pre-release versions of macOS 10.13 have been picking up steadily since the beginning of the year, presumably as Apple's engineers work on the operating system update ahead of its unveiling. Visits to MacRumors from Macs running macOS 10.13 We don't know what the successor to macOS Sierra will be called, but in 2014, Apple trademarked a long list of names that could be used for future updates. Names range from popular beaches and well-known cities in California, where Apple is headquartered, to mountains, deserts, and animals. A list of known trademarked names that have yet to be used: Redwood, Mammoth, California, Big Sur, Pacific, Diablo, Miramar, Rincon, Redtail, Condor, Grizzly, Farallon, Tiburon, Monterey, Skyline, Shasta, Mojave, Sequoia, Ventura, and Sonoma. An entirely different name is certainly possible too. macOS 10.13 will likely be seeded to developers for testing purposes in early June ahead of a public release by the end of October. The beta will likely be available to public testers over the summer as well.

I know a fair chunk of us think we want this but think it through: do we want to dummy down MacOS to be compatible with what iDevices can do or complicate iOS to better fit what whole computers can do? Full unification would involve such compromises. I know some of us look at Surface and think a Mac version of that is what we want but chat with people who really use Surface and see if they think duality built in is as great as spun in marketing focused on very select benefits. Rating: 13 Votes Stella 1 week ago Apple should really use this as an opportunity to unify. iOS 11 and macOS 11 No thanks. OSX has been dumbed down enough already. No unification necessary especially if that involves making OSX a closed ecosystem - downloading software only from the (Mac)AppStore. Sierra was a very disappointing release.

Well, we know it will support: APFS, improvements to Siri (maybe Hey, Siri support), tighter integration with iCloud - might sync the entire system to iCloud. I hope they add a mobile metered connection setting, when I connect my MacBook Pro to my iPhones mobile hotspot, it depletes the data in no time. Windows 10 has this built in, while its not perfect, it helps a great deal with handing mobile data. Apart from that Sierra has been pretty solid and I can say its been the case since I bought my first Mac in 2015. Came with Yosemite and each upgrade has been a good one.

Apple Watch | 02 Mar 2017 | Print  | Comment (13) New Apple Watch Stand Looks Like the 128K Mac by Julio Ojeda-Zapata I hadn’t planned to write about Elago’s W3 Stand, an Apple Watch charging stand in the shape of a classic 128K Macintosh. I mean, what is there to say? “It’s an Apple Watch charging stand in the shape of a classic 128K Macintosh.” The end. But I realized Elago had concocted something brilliant when a buddy last week bestowed the product upon me — a thoughtful gesture after a recent death in my family — and other friends around a taproom table erupted with delight and a bit of envy. I was even more surprised later that day when my wife spotted the accessory on my desk and went gaga over it. You must understand a couple of things about my wife: She does not own an Apple Watch, has no interest in ever getting one, and has never been steeped in Apple lore. She adores her MacBook Air, but only in a utilitarian sense. Yet, hovering and cooing over the W3, she told me she wanted one – just because. So did I when I first heard about it. After all, I own a nonfunctional 128K Mac, a decorative prop that has a place of honor in my home office right near my Power Mac G4 Cube. The Elago W3 fits right in at Julio Geek Central. I have the $14.99 tan-colored model that approximates the color of the original Mac. Elago also sells a $15.99 dark-gray version, which is a strange color choice in the Mac sense, but matches darker-colored watches and straps. The stand is a simple yet substantial little thing made of soft, sturdy rubber. It’s a mini-Mac, but with a vertical slot for the Apple Watch to slide in. Within the stand, there’s a circular cutout for Apple’s watch charging pad. The W3’s cable threads downward through the accessory and out the back, mimicking the look of the classic Mac’s power cable. The stand’s screen is just a cutout, so when the Apple Watch drops into place, its face becomes the actual, functional “Mac” display. The Apple Watch sits on its side, which activates Nightstand mode and transforms the W3 into a nifty bedside clock with a classic-Mac look and feel. It even has details such as a faux floppy-disk slot, complete with a tiny paperclip-eject hole, but no Apple logo that might attract legal attention. I’m using the Elago in the bedroom with a first-generation Apple Watch (my Series 2 watch charges up in my home office on the far-more-utilitarian Griffin WatchStand Powered Charging Station that also charges my iPhone). I put the original Apple Watch on my night table in Airplane mode to keep activity to a minimum and left it there as a permanent fixture. In fact, I am experimenting with using the Apple Watch strapless to heighten the classic-Mac effect: But I suspect the mini-Mac clock will quietly migrate to my wife’s side of the bed before long. That’s fine, anything to foster marital bliss. I hope whoever came up with this cute product at Elago got a bonus. And I wonder if sequels might be in the works — a Bondi Blue iMac charging stand, perhaps?   Setapp: Explore a universe of apps for just $9.99 per month!

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Aaron Priven  2017-03-02 19:36 Somebody needs to write a MacOS 6 emulator for Apple Watch. Or at least make a nightstand mode that displays the time in Chicago font. Reply Julio Ojeda-Zapata  2017-03-06 20:53 Good ideas! Reply Michelle Steiner  2017-03-02 22:14 I've had one for a few months. I have a 0.3 meter charging cable that plugs into a USB port on the clock on my nightstand, so I now have two nightstand clocks. But one looks like a 128K Mac. I think I'll put an Apple logo on it. Reply Julio Ojeda-Zapata  2017-03-06 20:52 When you put the Apple logo on it, send us a picture. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-03-06 20:10 One problem: it is only available in white, or for $1 more, black. Where's beige? Reply Julio Ojeda-Zapata  2017-03-06 20:52 The white model is actually beige. So, you have two color options, beige or black (which is actually a very dark gray). Reply Pete  2017-03-06 22:03 "I hope whomever [sic] came up with this cute product..." Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-07 09:24 Fixed! Reply Todd V. Jonker  2017-03-07 01:45 I love my little-mac stand, but my watch always turns itself off after a little while. Is there a way to prevent it from doing so while it's charging in the stand? Reply Julio Ojeda-Zapata  2017-03-07 07:32 Not to my knowledge. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-07 10:05 Here are details about Nightstand mode. You just need to nudge it. http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205045 Reply Julio Ojeda-Zapata  2017-03-07 10:27 Adam is correct! You don't even need to touch the watch itself. I just give the edge of my night table a light nudge or tap, and that awakens the nearby watch. Reply Quoc Vo  2017-03-07 18:52 If you have a 3D printer, you can print one yourself. I printed one and have been using it for a year. It's a great stand...so retro. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1216409 Reply To leave a comment, click Add a Comment and then enter the text, your name, and your email address (which won't be displayed).

Packing rather outdated specs but performing at par with the best machines available on the market, the premium-priced devices attracted both acclaim and criticism from conventional users and die-hard Apple fans alike. If rumors are any indication, however, this year would be a completely different story, as the MacBook Pro 2017 is speculated to address several issues that were prevalent on the 2016 MacBook Pro. One area where the MacBook Pro 2016 definitely lagged in was its processor. Shipping with 6th-generation Skylake chips, the MacBook Pro 2016 was quite underpowered compared to rivals that were already on the market. For the MacBook Pro 2017, however, Apple seems intent on ensuring that the upcoming flagship laptop would feature the best and latest processor that Intel has to offer, according to a TechRadar report. Thus, while the Cupertino-based tech giant took its time, it seems that 2017 would finally be the year when Apple would embrace Intel’s 7th-generation Kaby Lake processors. Switching to Kaby Lake processors would give the MacBook Pro 2017 a necessary speed boost, especially since the laptop itself is designed for professional users. After all, the MBP line has always been geared towards power users, and previous iterations of the laptop have succeeded largely in this respect. With Kaby Lake processors, Apple would not only be catching up to the competition, it would finally make the MacBook Pro 2017 a device that is worthy of its name. [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] The rumored Kaby Lake upgrade for the MacBook Pro 2017 also opens up the possibility of a 32GB RAM option for the upcoming devices. One of the most disappointing aspects about the 2016 MacBook Pro was the fact that its most premium configuration topped out at a modest 16GB RAM, which is adequate for conventional use but severely lacking when the device tackles professional-grade graphics-intensive applications. With a 32GB option for the MacBook Pro 2017, Apple would be able to address this issue, finally offering a noteworthy configuration for the brand’s loyal power users. Apart from the MacBook Pro 2017’s Kaby Lake processor and 32GB RAM option, rumors are also high that the upcoming laptop would be packing a far superior battery pack than the 2016 model, according to a Gotta Be Mobile report. Despite promises from Apple that the 2016 MacBook Pro would last long hours away from a power outlet, complaints of poor battery life immediately saturated forums about the 2016 MacBook Pro after its release. Apple eventually addressed these problems in an update, but the current MacBook Pro’s battery life still leaves much to be desired. With the MacBook Pro 2017, Apple is expected to improve the device’s power consumption. This would already be made possible by Intel’s Kaby Lake processors, which consume significantly less power than the 2016 model’s Skylake chips. Intel, for one, has stated that its 7th-generation chips are capable of true 4K playback for up to 9.5 hours. Since Apple is known for optimizing its product’s software and hardware, the idea of the MacBook Pro 2017 having battery life that goes beyond 10 hours is very plausible. Considering that the MacBook Pro 2017 would mostly include incremental upgrades from the 2016 model, speculations are high that the device would come with one particularly unique feature that would justify the model’s release. With this in mind, speculations are high that the time might be right for Apple to debut a sharper display for its flagship laptop model. [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] Apple debuted the Retina display years ago when it released the iPhone 4, and since then, the Cupertino-based tech giant has remained as the standard in the industry when it comes to screen resolution. Over the years, however, Apple has seen its rivals meet and exceed its displays, and today, the MacBook Pro’s Retina screens are nothing special when compared to those utilized by its rivals. Considering that a pin-sharp display is one of the MacBook Pro’s trademark features, speculations are high that the 2017 model would debut a Retina 2.0 display, a superior screen resolution that would exceed the best that the tech giant currently offers. Details about the MacBook Pro 2017’s display are scarce, but speculations are high that the device might feature a 3,200×1,800 QHD+ panel, which would be a significant upgrade over the current model’s 2560×1600 resolution. Despite being seldom refreshed, the MacBook Pro is one of Apple’s strongest brands, and it shows in the current-generation devices’ sales. Since its launch, the laptop, even with its outdated internals, limited RAM and battery life issues, remains as one of the most competitive products in the portable computing world. With the MacBook Pro 2017, however, Apple has every chance to make its flagship laptop not only worthy of its name but worthy of its reputation as well.

Sony A6500 Specifically, tvOS 10.2 beta includes these changes: Accelerated Scrolling support for UIKit and TVMLKit apps Device Enrollment Program support Expanded Mobile Device Management support Support for the VideoToolbox framework While tvOS 10.2 doesn’t include any flashy new features, Apple has been steadily improving the platform with new video features including the new TV app and Single Sign-on. Here’s how Apple describes the TV app that was introduced in December: Watching TV has quickly become all about apps. And now, with the new TV app, you have one place to access shows and movies from multiple video apps — in one unified experience. The TV app lets you see all the movies and shows you’re watching. Find upcoming episodes. Get recommendations for new things to watch. See your entire iTunes video collection. You can even start watching a movie or show directly from the TV app. All without switching between individual apps. Single Sign-on is a separate feature introduced in December that lets users easily authenticate with a supported TV provider once, then access paid video apps that support the feature. tvOS 10.2 beta is only available for registered developers. Public beta versions of iOS and macOS are available, but tvOS and watchOS betas are only available through Apple’s developer program.

After the excitement and mayhem of last week's Mobile World Congress, this week wasn’t quite as mad – but there’s still been no shortage of intriguing news and spicy developments across the tech world in recent days. But don’t worry if you think you might have missed something, for 7 Days is here to walk you through the week’s top tech news once more. Ask away - but don't expect the answer to be correct Our journey begins this week in the United States, where Google's Home speaker hub was found to be spewing bizarre conspiracy theories in response to various enquiries. The root of the problem is Google's 'Featured Snippets', which employs algorithms to try to provide a single, direct answer to any enquiry - but some of these responses have been drawn from the most unreliable of sources. Image via BBC News Over in the UK, Facebook has been severely criticized for its bizarre response to a BBC News investigation into the social network's failures to crack down on child pornography. Facebook reported the BBC to the police after journalists complied with the company's demand to present evidence of the illegal content being shared on its site. UK telecommunications giant BT has been ordered by industry regulator Ofcom to reduce its bills for customers who only use its landline phone services. The move is expected to make a big difference to low-income and elderly customers. WikiLeaks published a range of documents and files which it claimed to have sourced from a secure CIA network, revealing details of the intelligence agency's efforts to use technology to covertly monitor unsuspecting users around the world. The leaks revealed the CIA's use of remotely activating cameras and microphones on smartphones, listening in on smart TVs, and interception of communications on devices before they're sent over encrypted services. Google said that it had dealt with 'many' of the exploits detailed in the leaks, and Apple added that many of the exploits had been patched on its devices too. Chinese manufacturer ZTE admitted that it had violated US sanctions in selling hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of equipment to Iran and North Korea. The company agreed to pay fines totalling $1.19 billion, and its exports will remain under close international scrutiny for three years. Chinese search giant Baidu has built on Google's DeepMind Wavenet technology, and created a version of the algorithm that can be trained in a matter of hours and perform faster than real-time human speech. IBM has been working on improving its speech recognition technology, bringing its word error rate down to just 5.5%, overtaking Microsoft's recent rate of 5.9%. Elsewhere, IBM researchers published details of a remarkable achievement this week: the ability to store a bit of data on a single atom, compared with modern hard disk drives, which use around 100,000 atoms to store each bit. Image via Shutterstock IDC published its latest projections for the global smartphone market, forecasting an increase in shipments this year, with over 1.5 billion shipments per year expected by 2021. comScore's latest data for January 2017 show that Apple is the largest smartphone vendor in the US by a considerable margin, but Android remains the top smartphone platform in overall use. Apple quietly launched a new version of its three-year-old iPhone 6 for select carriers in Asian markets. The 'iPhone 6 (2017) 32GB' is intended to offer a more affordable option for those wishing to buy an Apple device, but who can't justify spending far larger amounts on the newest models. Elsewhere, a report claimed that Apple's tenth-anniversary iPhone, due later this year, won't be called the iPhone 7s or iPhone 8, but rather the 'iPhone Edition'. Microsoft finally launched Cortana for iOS in the UK on Friday, coinciding with the release of the app's 2.0 update, which introduces a new look similar to that introduced on Android several months ago. The Motorola brand was phased out last year in favor of new 'Moto by Lenovo' sub-branding. But it seems Lenovo has now had a change of heart, and is preparing to reintroduce the iconic Motorola name. UK retailer Carphone Warehouse said that interest in the new Nokia 3310 - a more modern interpretation of the much-loved classic phone - has been "astonishing". The 3310 is expected to launch in the UK alongside the 3, 5 and 6 smartphones in May. However, future Nokia handsets, developed by HMD Global, will not use the Carl Zeiss optics that were used in many of Nokia's excellent smartphone cameras. On Friday, two months after its announcement, HTC began shipping its new U Ultra flagship in the United States, priced at $749. And in India, Samsung launched the 2017 editions of its mid-range Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 handsets. Samsung has reportedly pushed back the retail launch of its still-unannounced Galaxy S8 flagship by a week. The device - which has been extensively leaked in recent weeks - will be officially unveiled on March 29. Google acknowledged complaints about microphone issues from some owners of its flagship Pixel and Pixel XL handsets. It's recommended warranty replacements - but some users have reported experiencing the same issues on replacement units. After TCL unveiled the high-end BlackBerry KEYone last week, another new BlackBerry-branded handset was unveiled on Thursday. The Aurora has a large 720p display, Snapdragon 425 processor, 4GB RAM, 32GB storage and 13MP rear camera. On Tuesday, Google published its latest monthly breakdown of Android version usage. Android 7.x Nougat has more than doubled in usage since last month - but it's still on only 2.8% of active devices, almost seven months after its release. The Nougat update continues to slowly make its way to more devices: Verizon brings Nougat to Galaxy S7 and S7 edge Galaxy S7 active on AT&T gets Android 7.0 update Nougat rolls out to Galaxy S6 and S6 edge, and expands to more markets in Europe Android 7.0 makes its way to Huawei P9 Plus in Europe LG will bring Nougat to G4 and V10 flagships - but not until second half of 2017 Google released its March security update for Android on Monday, along with new Pixel and Nexus factory and OTA images. Verizon wasted no time in bringing the new patches to the Pixel and Pixel XL, and BlackBerry was quick to bring the updates to its devices too. Google announced a range of new security improvements for its Cloud Platform this week, including Identity-Aware Proxy, Data Loss Prevention, a new Key Management System, and more. Google Drive picked up numerous features aimed at improving the service for business and enterprise customers too. Google pushed ahead with its plans to transition Hangouts into a business-focused platform, with two new services - Meet and Chat - designed for organizations. And after announcing Jamboard - a competitor to Microsoft's Surface Hub - in October, Google revealed that its 55-inch collaboration display will be priced at $4,999 when it launches in May. Unlike the 55-inch Surface Hub, which only has a 1080p display, the Jamboard will get 4K resolution at the same size. Google released a stable version of Android Studio 2.3, the latest version of its integrated development environment (IDE). The new build brings a ton of improvements and significant tweaks for Android software developers. But for many developers, the biggest news of the week was Microsoft's release of Visual Studio 2017, which it calls the "most productive" version of the developer tools in their 20-year history. The new edition brings a huge range of improvements and new features, which Microsoft says offer "unparalleled" support for "any dev, any app, and any platform". Microsoft also launched Visual Studio Preview, offering early access to new upcoming features in its IDE. And alongside those announcements, it also rolled out Visual Studio for Mac Preview 4, with all sorts of enhancements and bug fixes. Microsoft introduced a preview of 'Playable Ads' for developers too. The name is a bit of a misnomer, given the impressions that it immediately conjures up. Essentially, it uses an ad for an app to stream the app to a user's device for up to three minutes, allowing them to get a taste of its functionality and design before deciding whether or not to install it. Microsoft announced that it's shutting down its experimental social network, Socl, next week, five years after its launch. Officially, Socl remained a research product throughout its existence. Microsoft's 'chat-based workspace', Teams - which will compete against popular collaboration platform Slack - will officially launch on March 14. Qualcomm announced a new partnership with Microsoft to bring "next-generation cloud services" to its Centriq 2400 platform, the chip-maker's first server processor built on ARM architecture. The collaboration includes a new version of Windows Server optimized for ARM processors. However, Microsoft later clarified that Windows Server for ARM is for its own internal use only. Meanwhile, Microsoft's .NET Core is coming to the Raspberry Pi 3, and an official .NET 2.0 Core release, adapted to run on ARM devices, is coming later this year. Microsoft delivered its first firmware update for four months to the Surface Book, along with new Surface Pro 4 firmware too. And it should come as no surprise that, yet again, the company is offering discounts on both devices in the US, with $200 off many models. Curiously, Microsoft has dropped the entry-level Core m3 model of the Surface Pro 4 that includes the Surface Pen in the US, so if you want to buy that particular device, you'll have to purchase the Pen separately. In another unusual decision, Microsoft launched a new Surface Book model, priced at $2,999, with a Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM and 1TB storage, but no discrete GPU. If you're willing to pay that kind of money for such a high-performance device, wouldn't you just pay the extra $200 for the otherwise identical dGPU model? Microsoft's Surface Studio all-in-one PC, priced from $2,999, remains exclusively available in the US. But the company confirmed that it will go on sale in France in July - around nine months after it was first announced. By that time, the graphics card in the 'entry-level' Studio will be two and a half years old. HP announced a new range of all-in-ones and other desktop PCs aimed at business customers, including some rather stylish models. HP also teased a new, larger version of the notebook-style Lap Dock accessory for its Elite x3 Windows 10 Mobile flagship. At Mobile World Congress last week, it briefly showed a revised version of the handset itself too. Perhaps clearing inventory for the new model, Microsoft slashed 25% off the Elite x3 and Desk Dock bundle in the US, reducing its price to $599 in a deal lasting several weeks. Shazam became the latest high-profile brand to ditch its app on Microsoft's Windows phones and PCs. Microsoft confirmed that its upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update will be released for PCs first, coming to Mobile devices later. How much later remains to be seen, although the gap between PC and phone releases for last year's Anniversary Update was two weeks. Microsoft also rolled out Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview build 15051 to the Slow ring on Friday, along with build 15055 to PCs and phones in the Fast ring. You can see the fixes and known issues for PCs here, and those for Mobile here. Incidentally, build 15055 is also the first Windows 10 preview to be released that identifies its version number as 1703, replacing the Anniversary Update's 'Version 1607'. Microsoft's Sticky Notes app on Windows 10 picked up a few new features for Insiders in the Slow ring... ...who also got some nice additions (pun intended) to the OneNote UWP app. The Groove Music app on Windows 10 got some new features and some minor UX tweaks for Insiders as well. But the Movies & TV app got a much bigger overhaul, with a completely redesigned interface, and new features to enhance content discovery. Insiders got their first taste of the new 'Compact Overlay' feature in the Skype Preview app on Windows 10 this week. The Skype Preview app also made its debut on the Xbox One and Xbox One S for Insiders in the Alpha ring - but Compact Overlay isn't yet included on the consoles. The Alpha ring got updated to Xbox One Insider Preview build 15051, and while it was light on new features and fixes, there were plenty of known issues to be aware of. Months ahead of its launch, Microsoft's Project Scorpio - which it calls the "most powerful console ever" - made its debut in the Microsoft Store on Thursday. While Scorpio will include support for native 4K gaming, a report also claimed that the new console will bring big improvements to how games appear on 1080p TVs. Some new games launched on the Xbox One this week, including LEGO Worlds... ...Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3, which was released on the Xbox 360 five years ago... ...and a real blast from the past: The King of Fighters '94. However, after Xbox One and Windows 10 exclusive Scalebound was cancelled this year, another game has now reached the end of the road before it even launched. Ion was first revealed at E3 2015, but its developers confirmed that work on the game has now ended. In happier news, Gran Turismo Sport will begin its closed beta on March 17 for PlayStation 4 gamers. Sony released its 4.50 system update for the PlayStation 4 this week, bringing Boost Mode, Voice Chat for Remote Play, and more. Crowdfunding platform Indiegogo suspended fundraising efforts by the developers of the Spectrum ZX Vega+ computer, after shipping delays, and a failure by Retro Computers to adequately communicate with backers and keep them update on the ongoing wait. Game-streaming service Twitch launched its own social stream called Pulse this week, and also announced plans to release a new desktop app. Nintendo published a new video overview for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which will launch on its Switch console next month. Our odyssey across the tech world this week ends with a ton of news about the new Nintendo Switch - so feast your eyes on this: Switch becomes the fastest-selling console in Nintendo's history Nintendo hides a small message to fans inside the Switch Pro controller Joy-Con controllers can be used on Windows PCs and other devices Apps like Netflix and Hulu will come to the Switch... but you'll have to wait Nintendo tells Switch users that dead pixels are 'normal' Switch durability test Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a couple of extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Nintendo has been touring North America giving gamers a chance to get some hands-on time with the Switch. If you won't be able to make it, Neowin's Timi Cantisano attended one of the events to show you what you're missing. Timi also published his review of the ZTE Blade V8 Pro, which was introduced at CES 2017. It offers great build quality, solid performance and strong battery life, along with some very keen pricing - but there are some significant downsides too... And finally, if you've been reluctant to buy a Windows phone, we're eager to hear why. Whether it's the app selection, the range of devices, the features in the OS, or some other reason, join in the discussion and share your thoughts with us! Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Michael Savage tells Newsmax TV he is deeply worried about WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's offer to share classified computer codes from stolen CIA documents with Apple, Google and other tech giants. This week, WikiLeaks made public some 8,000 CIA documents showing how the agency spied by tapping into smart phones and internet-wired TV sets, and Assange said some CIA material it possesses could aid the Silicon Valley powerhouses in fixing flaws in their software programs. "I'm very concerned about WikiLeaks joining the tech giants and I'll tell you why," the conservative radio host said Friday to Steve Malzberg on "America Talks Live." "Remember last year or so, the slaughter by Muslims of their coworkers at San Bernardino. Remember they killed people in cold blood?" Savage said, referring to the 2015 massacre in which 14 people were shot dead by husband-and-wife jihadists Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik. "Then they caught one of them, they found her phone or his phone and the FBI [chief James] Comey begged Apple [CEO] Tim Cook, to give them the encryption codes to get into the terrorist's phone and Tim Cook said, no we're not doing it. "To me, that was treason, they should've arrested Tim Cook, but they didn't. You know why? Because Apple, Google, those companies, they're bigger than U.S. Steel was at their peak. They are monopolies, they're bigger than the government. They have more power than any government does on this planet." Savage, author of the new book "Trump's War: His Battle for America," said that makes him suspicious of how such shared information would really be used. "When you see a man [Cook] defy the FBI like this, you have to ask yourself, is he really doing it for our privacy? Or is he doing it to sell more iPhones? Think about that, nobody wants the government tapping into our own iPhone, we give that. But it's this whole terrible question of security vs. privacy," Savage said. "We go back to [Founding Father] Ben Franklin, we know all of that stuff … But we're not living with Ben Franklin … we're living with fanatical Islamists amongst us who are plotting to destroy us as I speak. "I want my intelligence agencies, when they're caught, to be able to break into their iPhones. I don't care what the hell Tim Cook says." The New York Times reported that the tech companies have reacted "cautiously" to the WikiLeaks offer, saying there may be legal peril in accepting classified information stolen from the government. And a federal probe of WikiLeaks' dumping of the CIA documents has been launched. A collaboration between WikiLeaks and "the Tim Cooks, the Googles, the Microsofts, the Facebooks -- this is not good for us. This is frightening," Savage said. "If I have to draw a line in the sand, and someone says to me, who do you trust more, the CIA or Julian Assange of WikiLeaks? I go with the CIA … and do you know why? As rogue as we think the CIA is, there are checks and balances over that agency. There are no checks and balances over Julian Assange. "Who does he report to? Moreover, who is he? Where did he come from? What are his ties to foreign governments? There's something more to this picture than meets the eye … Something's wrong with that picture." Assange, who is under investigation over allegations of sexual assault and rape — charges he denies — has been living in the Embassy of Ecuador in London after being granted asylum by the South America country in 2012. Savage is heard by 10 million listeners a week on "The Michael Savage Show," which is syndicated across the U.S. in more than 300 markets. He is the author of 25 books, including four New York Times best-sellers. "Trump's War: His Battle for America," out next week, is published by Center Street, an imprint of the Hachette Book Group.

Following WikiLeaks' publication earlier this week of classified documents stolen from the CIA, major technology companies, including Apple, Samsung, Microsoft and Cisco, have been scrambling to assess the risks posed to their customers by the revelations. The so-called "Vault 7" leak includes information about methods and tools the CIA crafted to hack into products produced by those companies. Apple's initial analysis reportedly showed that many of the issues identifed in iOS already were patched in the latest version of the software. In addition methods of hacking iPhones, the WikiLeaks documents pointed to ways the CIA might exploit Windows PCs, Android phones and Samsung smart TVs. Google reportedly expressed confidence that existing security protections in Chrome and Android shield their users from many of the vulnerabilities identified in the WikiLeaks dump. Both Samsung and Microsoft reportedly said they were investigating the impact of the leaks. Routers and Linux Targeted Other targets of CIA hacking included Cisco and the Linux operating system, according to the Vault 7 documents. There is little actionable information in the WikiLeaks documents, noted Dario Ciccarone, a security researcher at Cisco. "At the time of the initial release, WikiLeaks has not released any of the tools or exploits associated with the disclosure," he pointed out. "Since none of the tools and malware referenced in the initial Vault 7 disclosure have been made available by WikiLeaks, the scope of action that can be taken by Cisco is limited. An ongoing investigation and focused analysis of the areas of code that are alluded to in the disclosure is underway," Ciccarone said. "Until more information is available, there is little Cisco can do at this time from a vulnerability handling perspective," he added. Linux's popularity makes it a likely target for intelligence agencies, according to Nicko van Someren, chief technology officer for The Linux Foundation. "Linux is a very widely used operating system with a huge installed base all around the world, so it is not surprising that state agencies from many countries would target Linux, along with the many closed source platforms that they have sought to compromise," he told TechNewsWorld. However, the rapid development cycle of the operating system -- a kernel update is released every few days -- enables Linux development teams to quickly address security problems, van Someren explained. "Rapid release cycles enable the open source community to fix vulnerabilities and release those fixes to users faster," he said. Assange Offers Sneak Peek WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange took to Facebook Live Thursday, offering to give tech companies making products targeted by CIA hacking tools exclusive access to any tools in WikiLeaks' possession, so the businesses could plug any security holes. Assange's offer poses a dilemma for the companies. While they want to make their products more secure, hooking up with WikiLeaks would mean collaborating with an organization that may have broken U.S. laws by accepting stolen data. At the least, it has undermined the nation's security by releasing classified information to the public. Still, "they should accept Assange's offer," argued Israel Barak, chief information security officer at Cybereason. "These companies have to make their software as secure as possible," he told TechNewsWorld. "When you have an opportunity to do that, you've got to do it." However, Assange's offer may be too little, too late. "My guess is that some of this code is already in the hands of bad actors," said Tony Busseri, CEO of Route1. "That's a point of concern for consumers, government and enterprises," he told TechNewsWorld. Consumer Impact Consumers shouldn't be too concerned about the Vault 7 leaks affecting their privacy and security, observed Craig Young, a computer security researcher at Tripwire. "Consumers should, however, be cognizant that the conveniences afforded by connected technologies also inherently introduce privacy and security risks," he told TechNewsWorld. "As data is made available to smart devices like TVs, phones and voice-activated speakers, consumers are in fact extending a large degree of trust to the vendors making these products. There is trust not only that vendors are making these devices securely, but also that the vendors will continue to support them," Young pointed out. "Even with all of these things in mind," he added, "there is always some risk -- so it is advisable not to share sensitive data with these smart devices." Most consumers wouldn't be affected by the tools WikiLeaks claims to have in its possession if the CIA had exclusive control of them, but that's not the case now. "The CIA is not going to try to hack your TV for no reason," Route1's Busseri said. "The danger with WikiLeaks is if it starts exposing how these vulnerabilities and toolkits work, then criminal organizations will try to profit from them at the consumer's expense," he explained. "These leaks are giving consumers a glimpse into how their devices can be used to spy on them," said Cybereason's Barak. The leaks illustrate how vulnerable all digital devices are. "The technology to hack into these systems is advancing just as rapidly as the security to protect them," said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "Nothing will ever be 100 percent secure," he told TechNewsWorld, "just as no doctor will ever say with 100 percent accuracy what's wrong with you." John P.

TrendsViral, WikiLeaks CIA files On March 7, WikiLeaks released documents leaked from a “high security” network within the CIA. The files, dubbed “Vault 7,” have been described by the whistleblowing site as the “largest ever publication of confidential documents” on the CIA.  READ MORE: Apple, Samsung, Microsoft: WikiLeaks blows lid on scale of CIA’s #Vault7 hacking arsenal  The documents purportedly hold details about the agency’s capabilities to tap into smartphones, televisions and messaging apps, even before encryption has been applied.  RELEASE: Vault 7 Part 1 "Year Zero": Inside the CIA's global hacking force https://t.co/h5wzfrReyypic.twitter.com/N2lxyHH9jp— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 7, 2017 The CIA has refused to comment on the authenticity of the documents and the source of the leak has not been revealed. However, the incident has reignited fears about whether privacy can ever truly be guarded in the modern world. Here’s what you need to know about the Vault 7 release: - A treasure trove of spy material  WikiLeaks said the release is just 1 percent of the Vault 7 documents it has obtained. The first leak contains approximately 8,761 files and millions of codes, which allegedly originate from a CIA center in Langley, Virginia and date from 2013 to 2016. The details provided so far by WikiLeaks read like a program hell-bent on gathering information that could be used to exploit security vulnerabilities in tech made by some of the world’s biggest manufacturers.

To date, Apple’s iOS operating system, Google’s Android phones, Telegram, WhatsApp and Microsoft Windows programs are said to have been targets. The top selling television brand in 2015, Samsung, was also subject to the surreptitious advances by the CIA, according to WikiLeaks. The company’s smart television device was reportedly earmarked for a fake “off-mode” hack, through which audio could be secretly recorded.

Tech firms such as Samsung and Apple have since moved to allay customers’ fears, although company concern over unknown software vulnerabilities is palpable. “While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities,” Apple said. A day later, Samsung reacts to the CIA news with a statement. https://t.co/alBbm2BjWJpic.twitter.com/X5MfxtOZv1— Lorenzo Franceschi-B (@lorenzoFB) March 8, 2017 Samsung said: “Protecting consumers’ privacy and the security of our devices is a top priority,” and added, “We are aware of the report in question and are urgently looking into the matter.” Google says it is confident that its security updates have patched areas open to exploitation. However, it is continuing to carry out an investigation into their concerns. “Our analysis is ongoing and we will implement any further necessary protections,” the search engine giant told Recode.

It added: “The tools from ‘Vault 7’ are like a map of [secret] tunnels. Now that device and OS manufacturers like Apple and Google will get this map, they can start filling in the holes and boarding up the passages.” Chat application Telegram issues statement on CIA attacks in today's WikiLeaks' "Year Zero" publication https://t.co/acTMkdl1A7pic.twitter.com/XVKbMkG3gj— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) March 7, 2017 - Digital Geneva Convention  Outside of a scramble to secure products and maintain consumer trust, the WikiLeaks revelations have led to more broad suggestions on how to stem seemingly runaway government surveillance. One such idea has been a so-called “Digital Geneva Convention,” mooted by Microsoft president Brad Smith in February and then promoted by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during a Vault 7 video stream. The concept would most likely be symbolic and a benchmark for government cyber activities. Microsoft’s vision of such a global consensus involves tech companies and private sector businesses being out of bounds for nation-state hacking. It also states that any cyber weapons developed by governments would not be “reusable.” Where to watch Schedule Where to watch Schedule News America UK Russian politics Business Sport Op-Edge More Live Where to watch In vision In motion RT360 Shows Schedule Business projects Legal disclaimer Privacy policy Feedback About us Vacancies Contact info On-Air Talent RT NEWS APP Android iOS Windows phone Windows 8 العربية Español Русский Deutsch Français ИНОТВ RTД RUPTLY Applications RSS facebook twitter youtube google-plus instagram soundcloud coub © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2017.

Following WikiLeaks' publication earlier this week of classified documents stolen from the CIA, major technology companies, including Apple, Samsung, Microsoft and Cisco, have been scrambling to assess the risks posed to their customers by the revelations. The so-called "Vault 7" leak includes information about methods and tools the CIA crafted to hack into products produced by those companies. Apple's initial analysis reportedly showed that many of the issues identifed in iOS already were patched in the latest version of the software. In addition methods of hacking iPhones, the WikiLeaks documents pointed to ways the CIA might exploit Windows PCs, Android phones and Samsung smart TVs. Google reportedly expressed confidence that existing security protections in Chrome and Android shield their users from many of the vulnerabilities identified in the WikiLeaks dump. Both Samsung and Microsoft reportedly said they were investigating the impact of the leaks. Routers and Linux Targeted Other targets of CIA hacking included Cisco and the Linux operating system, according to the Vault 7 documents. There is little actionable information in the WikiLeaks documents, noted Dario Ciccarone, a security researcher at Cisco. "At the time of the initial release, WikiLeaks has not released any of the tools or exploits associated with the disclosure," he pointed out. "Since none of the tools and malware referenced in the initial Vault 7 disclosure have been made available by WikiLeaks, the scope of action that can be taken by Cisco is limited. An ongoing investigation and focused analysis of the areas of code that are alluded to in the disclosure is underway," Ciccarone said. "Until more information is available, there is little Cisco can do at this time from a vulnerability handling perspective," he added. Linux's popularity makes it a likely target for intelligence agencies, according to Nicko van Someren, chief technology officer for The Linux Foundation. "Linux is a very widely used operating system with a huge installed base all around the world, so it is not surprising that state agencies from many countries would target Linux, along with the many closed source platforms that they have sought to compromise," he told TechNewsWorld. However, the rapid development cycle of the operating system -- a kernel update is released every few days -- enables Linux development teams to quickly address security problems, van Someren explained. "Rapid release cycles enable the open source community to fix vulnerabilities and release those fixes to users faster," he said. Assange Offers Sneak Peek WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange took to Facebook Live Thursday, offering to give tech companies making products targeted by CIA hacking tools exclusive access to any tools in WikiLeaks' possession, so the businesses could plug any security holes. Assange's offer poses a dilemma for the companies. While they want to make their products more secure, hooking up with WikiLeaks would mean collaborating with an organization that may have broken U.S. laws by accepting stolen data. At the least, it has undermined the nation's security by releasing classified information to the public. Still, "they should accept Assange's offer," argued Israel Barak, chief information security officer at Cybereason. "These companies have to make their software as secure as possible," he told TechNewsWorld. "When you have an opportunity to do that, you've got to do it." However, Assange's offer may be too little, too late. "My guess is that some of this code is already in the hands of bad actors," said Tony Busseri, CEO of Route1. "That's a point of concern for consumers, government and enterprises," he told TechNewsWorld. Consumer Impact Consumers shouldn't be too concerned about the Vault 7 leaks affecting their privacy and security, observed Craig Young, a computer security researcher at Tripwire. "Consumers should, however, be cognizant that the conveniences afforded by connected technologies also inherently introduce privacy and security risks," he told TechNewsWorld. "As data is made available to smart devices like TVs, phones and voice-activated speakers, consumers are in fact extending a large degree of trust to the vendors making these products. There is trust not only that vendors are making these devices securely, but also that the vendors will continue to support them," Young pointed out. "Even with all of these things in mind," he added, "there is always some risk -- so it is advisable not to share sensitive data with these smart devices." Most consumers wouldn't be affected by the tools WikiLeaks claims to have in its possession if the CIA had exclusive control of them, but that's not the case now. "The CIA is not going to try to hack your TV for no reason," Route1's Busseri said. "The danger with WikiLeaks is if it starts exposing how these vulnerabilities and toolkits work, then criminal organizations will try to profit from them at the consumer's expense," he explained. "These leaks are giving consumers a glimpse into how their devices can be used to spy on them," said Cybereason's Barak. The leaks illustrate how vulnerable all digital devices are. "The technology to hack into these systems is advancing just as rapidly as the security to protect them," said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "Nothing will ever be 100 percent secure," he told TechNewsWorld, "just as no doctor will ever say with 100 percent accuracy what's wrong with you." John P.

It's all fair game with a WEEI. I fact it's our number zero of the shepherd and Thornton experience. The religious went to that we wait for tomorrow will run again from night of one and the highly anticipated segment it is breaking it's gone viral. But Bruntlett Brad folk at 11 o'clock looks at level five which would we do every Sunday now would rob Dunn four buys another edition tomorrow. 1105 where we talked everything bought Red Sox on the whole Obama Moses yeah Obama most of strawberries and cream. No school loans what do we do it up right here I just a quick side of report it back to the job. We get before detected via the calls them all all jammed up those of you participating. And that check report where's the game to Michael citizens or directly yet. Tell me real quick but it doesn't matter where it is so if you're waiting. For the report Tuesday to let myself. I just talked about LaMarcus Aldridge and his heart Revere problems so he's out indefinitely. Not only that. It's in it's it's in San Antonio tonight so as you're cruising around San Antonio. The river walk which is beautiful by the way were my favorite cities in Texas. To go to the Alamo. And any particular unit to a possible western copper to preview between the sixth championship between the spurs and the Golden State Warriors. If we could sell you tickets are what sell them now is not only is LaMarcus on the docket play. I could say this no Kevin Durant we know that. You also have. The Golden State Warriors saying today. That. Step curry trade Ahman Green clay Thompson Andre Iguodala will not play tonight in that game. The students at that this could not it was like the world always that classically that. You don't have LaMarcus Aldridge the senate Tony you also don't have why lettered. Who's into the NBA's concussion protocol after banging it out on Thursday that Oklahoma City. So if you are big fans of people like Patrick McCall and Davis birch rants. They're good guys being double Popovich would never stick it to the league by sit down his best player of dollar an hour at that game by and I detected with. I love that about him. I'd like a lot of things about Popovich he could coach my team any time obviously snipes is great I love the arrogance. I love the fact that when they stick his team on national TV on the second night of a bag impacted he just sits out Rollins. Starters and says I don't I don't care the go ahead Sumi it's brilliant now. Before we go to the colts beat quick as him it will only mentioned him on the out. It in the trending. The coney he'll be peck got a trade. So let's talk enough about it's incredible that is the Carolinas they are livid. He was that the patriots but they are upset that that deal was made and well they should be quite. I don't think what you think of the player if you think each is kind of a role player you know not not a star in the league. Fine to get him the. Eight picks on Saturday of the draft right that's going from a ten to 8 PM you know world that's going back from whatever was 604072. It's laughable. Politics should have been wearing a mask when he made that deal now as far as the player always. He is serviceable competitive guy he's durable he's gonna get better version of Chris Long that's what he's been. He's six years younger and basically seven years younger the long beast at birth dates arm if you look at. What he did in the Super Bowl a couple of years ago he played 23 snaps it was 38%. Of that that the snaps that the defensive snaps for Carolina. This past Super Bowl Kristol Juan love them great for him like he played fifteen deeply 31% of the patriots defensive snaps but why would I don't Wear your urge one word to the group a holding call he got obviously the Super Bowl what's yours without question and he. He did a lot this year without one employee he earned his paycheck here and arraigned here in our undying gratitude. But they moved on from him. It gave up. Old virtually nothing to get a guy who's the same sizes him is more athletic at this point. And will be with them for a couple of seasons that he's done he's got a east on the end of a rookie contract. That is a steal of epic proportions and if I could if I'm Jerry Richardson of Colin and somebody got X. We got out of what. It's what 77797. That it threw seven Mike that's what this that you got from your Christmas stocking that is does that weigh in Italian family's grief for at least. And a lot of families ago when I was younger yeah once I get a market for my I dictated through but it was always these there was always fruit that's that's weighted than volcanic. It and data given out at Halloween so I love dog out of those people should be arrested all the players and we always got to I was like you know. On yeah we always got for educated Obama's offer to start let's not that uncommon. Rios with us it's what's up it's that it's Democrats or the seventh talkers and kicks it affects you repeat. Area W I it's only. A you do when. Apple. And option that does not go to all these big giants. I don't know it's going to talk to go. The giants Eagles had a. Eli is in trouble all right and by the way let's say you've gut tea at the star player on the team is a mercurial nut job who got that got my hands let's bring in Brandon Marshall. That's a great idea let's take that that bottle of ammonia and up total chlorine import them into again achieved no you know. There's or what we will go next year. And I understand why don't you think somebody who sacrificed first round pick in China can. It one of the top ten quarterbacks in the league he's one of its war options position. Oh I thought if I let's send it can happen out obvious Don I will be stunned as I said if he gets stapled when he were a Villa beat it beat gets no. Freeagent operas from the other 31 teams I'll be shocked shocked so we got the air it. Quite poor in forty years supper like that you know typical first round pick tickets went fast. Yeah but it Joyce that's right it just never happens though. In colonial and Tony I'm Tony answer. Firebird and in the eye called August 2 up its position on the media packets that can happen very often. Yeah I just would be stunned I I think it's there for a reason it's a disincentive for teams to give up. That much to get a guy knowing that there's other free agents out there that you can just pay them and still keep it if first round picks up. Stranger things have happened but one when you're on fourteen years without anyone moving in that fashion it's hard to imagine it's gonna happily them. What what are you don't have a first round. Can sign him to a lot of. I would imagine not related you have to put the team when that's there. That's the Chrysler yet. Is the first round pick and eighteen your. Assumption this the other teams that are. Picked up some equity culture it. Trader greatly your first. Order concern cute with IQ and I walked up eighteen Bernanke. Quarter well. The other thing Tony to Jerry this year I think right now the league is actually as I said frightened of the patriots in the fight of Belichick. And I don't I think there's a lot of GMs right now let's say they do to talk so that Tony that you'll just regional states. Ten years forty. They're probably thinking why am I wasting my time the page to go to match that and he's not going anywhere I'd I'd I think it'd have to be so overwhelming right now and I'm wondering. Deep down some of these GM's. In hell it's even a 44 of warrior forty million dollar bills come to cut it because it's soccer to the many good the pitcher they're committed matches. Stan achieve greater cost more marquee. Wow is this. One million bucks now are people will be eighty here. Yeah but they see they they have the leverage though they can do you know whatever happens they can always match so they don't have to do a damn thing action in. And and you know just from a a practical standpoint guys is if things don't look at the teams. That would be interested in doing that appeal all automatically have to go towards the back third of the first round it's hard to imagine team's gonna give up the sixth pick. To get. Malcolm Butler than have to pay them all that money that sort of thing so you look at the teams who sit there. Kind of Miami looks like one you'd only suggested that they could do that just as they weighed a kind of engender goodwill with the player and they go down there and have a positive. Meeting and they say boy we really want you Malcolm I'll tell you what if we can't do it now about next year you'll come here we you'll be welcome unlike. That date evil you know angry little man in the great quality like we will love you down here. You know so there's sort of a risk that the patriots are taken by. The idea that. One of the really bad teams is gonna give up a high pick to get him it's just not it just goes against all common sense. Dad I saw the ball might be in play from Malcolm Butler but it autumn though the patriots have targeted on that team again if they're gonna trade him barely got coats from. As the stole him away I think I mean that dot back in a devote Butler is that says a lot of what will seek. I think all the most regret saying it's impossible to Malcolm bubble could trade it certainly is a possibility. But unless it's there are really great deal from going without on the why you were Joseph I'd I'd make it very intrigued by the possibility. A hightower returning which are well your your branch you're gonna have a tremendous. You have a tremendous defensive backfield. If you know to to rock Harmon is back to his wealth for some more insurance back there. McCorvey. It's just unbelievable to protect potential and it's not even. They're not done yet and that's your report. I'll save cities on my road umpire still yesterday night I hate the cop out and say if I would given a letter grade right now to their offseason I would give them an incomplete. But to me the hightower thing is is everything. If he stays. That's in day they they get us holiday regardless of what else happens if he leaves. You know it could drop down as low as a CE nine I won't let it's gonna leave a huge appetite. I feel it's what we said at the start of the shell every minute that passes that high towers not sign with somebody else. I feel like it just increases the likelihood he's eyesore. Agree and also you gotta think maybe the page to thank you let's wait to see what happens in the high tower situation get that squared away and then. We'll go after Malcolm and secure him and you know don't discount that also hears us Scott and build an exterior doubled Riyadh. Hey guys welcome back thanks wanted to just that your real quick just some food for thought. I'm with what Belichick has done over the course of the last couple days with trades. See who with a deep draft coming up I've got to think that they're going to have to trade Iraq allow to get some traffic. And the able to full color fortified you know their roster so media with that and was about yet. OK they are about how to come up with Scott I expired because this team that is always. Not built for the future and not built for the now they've done both simultaneously. And they've proven it can be done. And. Right now as it stands speed if they don't make a move with grapple they love gone too who seasons with Cota picked in the top 59 of the draft. That's unheard of especially for a team that has built a dynasty through that sweet spot. That they the way they see it between say thirty and sixty. And to go true seasons in a role without any picks at all in the act that leaves a gap that comes to end if you go back further. The last and they had to pick in there. Was Dominique Easley they got to seizes on him and he's gone so yeah. You dodger hall by the way had I had a picture on filtered email about what now Michael Holley had had Mayo you read that one but you know we thought he would not that they regret Glenn's house to show you know it's it's hard sometimes to appreciate might genius of Mohammed takes the final look back. And clearly so I blame you for injuries. He didn't he didn't work out in the in the long and clearly so too gold. Three years in a row without a single hit in the first round is that that's a whole thing for a team to sustain. Even though I feel like eight they'd you don't think they can always get up. But Chris Long they can always get a branding crooks they can always get a guy to fill that gap. Eventually that bill comes due sell I it's just all the more incentive for them to move Jimmy. The government should WEEI Angelo Angelo major. I don't do as I was about to happen. But not provide an adequate. Now saying they did occur and so what are the probability of re retiring after two more years. I mean it's certainly it's I mean I've got to where you go that's our I look at it possibly can win a Super Bowl next year and you bill could decide I had an outbreak there a number of Al those I mean overall. But I did it take him at his word Angelo that I think she thinks he can at least played a very very high level. For at least three more years I really believe that he has as a gold now depending on how big Gupta gets third between now and then. It may change his tone a little bit but there's no reason to think there's been no sign of any decline just the opposite so. I'm gonna say he's gonna be around for at least three more years until late he otherwise. Now nothing and I do not want them to trade grapple logos are some I don't want to let me into the keys. And it came I did not. Not ever died two years from now what could be three years from now and what a great place for three more years. We're equally remote yet I think he cannot be set but I do not want respect. Candidates eager sort of did you MacLeod oh I had more experience he gained in the system. Percentage of principle you knew me and just fine. Yeah but not an enjoy I. It looked you think you may be radio Angelo but I'm I said this early I'll say it again it's it's bizarre they. People are talking in such definitive simple bulls players. Your medical blowback when they drafting grapple I'll. Just tied pick up the sky hoping. He's in my point is well. I also hope I never need my spare tire rubs the gonna carry one of the car and I wanted to work. What I say it's very possible that. Percent rates are higher with them then go right apple does we don't know bullet repeat the draft that the guy he had a pedigree. Looked. Call for the eat you looked at competent when he was in there. Our guys vote that you are restrict it it probably remember is geared 617711. I severed that pollution thought yeah I don't know ask him a percent take over the team. In September nota I want grapple open on the basis of six quarters we've all decided. That grapples actual lead heir apparent to Brady and present couldn't possibly be. While I was anybody's saying that on Friday morning after the Houston game and how it. Item on the on Tuesday and did the patriots obviously have a lot of faith into cold percent of it wouldn't of kept him around this season it would of the jamaat IR for the season he came off the injury report and they wanted to traveling with the team they wanna name a riled. To keep the experience. A lot. That's how highly I think of him so. It held to while rcn and got the bigger Brady got hurt opening day that your or something and I might try to drop global percent of course I take a problem for us from what I've seen. I but. Things can happen you can develop the capital parade from 2002001. Went from four the second to have. Legend that he would go cold every year for the second the legend of cold that. And find that game against Houston where he you know even though he was banged up for the better you know the second half of that game. He won 27 and Austin played his ass off he couldn't run he was making reads. Yes the accuracy could stand to be improved decking come with time. I just refused to accept that. Shall Igor apple can do it absolutely percent can't and regardless we're not gonna have to know four I love those three players here isolate Brady finally I think it's at least. More years before it and other real Baird who's gonna take over this team it's going to be at least three years may be even longer. Awful lot longer morals what I know about the power of come quiets the amendment had to NATO's and. And magical pajamas and then clearly you know this is a guy horrible and for infinity. On my Garretson whatsoever it's habits overnight seven under through seven Pete Joseph Al Charlie Mike you guys all jammed up and doubled gets all your fault call speech or Jerry Thornton talked and pats. Until three right here on Sports Radio W Wii yet. Women's sports topics discussed right now here's Mora. And carry Georgia punt Sports Radio W we. It makes me bill that checked it and this is an IMAX film maybe he's fearful. That top rate is going to fall. All full clip. And that's the reason while we cabinet. Dan idiotic that's got it because go well although it's no airdrop Eric I am not gonna say that a dual deck late Tuesday is the heir apparent. That Tom Brady I'm not so ugly and he does the Walt and I don't think we don't think wolf all lobbed at operating going to. Steve Barrow this week now first thing with the men in Mexico there's so. Then thank you Stephen A paternity into it. When you begin a sentence vice in May be Bill Belichick is listening to Max Kellerman. That better ended a punch line about when did thank god yes I did Lou there is there is no reality anywhere in the cosmos we are. Belichick's on on you know account and has a really good point. I'll take it or not they have pretty good and mightily in this publicity would mock the other night Angela allow me to go off on it all that are absolutely guys go to commercial. I flipped a 985. In the field of youth on the air is. Is he actually said that he fixed as well this day. They picked up Dwayne Allen. Because they understand. That that it's time to move on from Rob Gronkowski. How safe bet to an audience with notes all of them. I have no respect for you I think you people morons aimed trolling the hell lot you right now. You're you're trying to imply that there is no such thing as a two tight end offense. They you can't help these guys on the field at the same time not help it has to be a negative they pick up a guy. Whose young who's under contract. They got him for next to nothing in you've got a spirited as well they hope this is not is behind the wood pile at the end. Do you ever Rob Gronkowski you can't possibly capable of bump. Just stop it if you're listening of that stuff. You're just basically allowing yourself to be treated like. A moron. That's happened at an item a witness six whatsoever severance of about seven knighted 37. He had some of the some of the takes from a bit of the people speaking in absolutes and I'm sorry at a Shepperd about the respect. You know Borges couple weeks or last week there appear to others I mean just like absolutely typical tropical not to drip. They don't Steve Fabian and XT but it being the voice of reason this week the other I. Anybody could speak it absolutes of what the hell's going on here with too big a problem it's just I don't if it's it's. It may be really obvious to someone way or the other it's not obvious to me. It is that I think eventually he will be traded. I don't see Bill Belichick keeping Jimmy coop blow off the bench for three more years he's not. Franchise and he's not walked away at the next season for nothing. Did you ever see bell objecting that way right. You've got this asset that's sitting there you drafted present for a reason because you have some confidence that you can develop them. You've kept them this long so clearly so far so good with that. You've got this set the you can turn into gold he just let him sit on the bench and then. Walk away with the exception of old Tom Brady might get hurt OK great today as exit account of that with 1 o'clock we'll get certain pre season and likely to take. Lot more snaps at radio can assure you that what that happens and you still you try to be gotten out before we go down that road. But don't tell me at the stock how is that stock could be any higher in three years even two years of age it not as ass wait for Brady to get hurt. Or or or forty point blow out how exactly and help the patriots down the stretch. Now. Especially won't likely Thomas of three more years I've just tell on you. I'd I'd like my scenario lot better that absolutely not gonna get traded. I don't know I speak in absolutes I may very well not be traded. I don't I don't doubt that I don't doubt that at a separate facts are. You know that he rates are accurate that doesn't. Mean. When you wanna call being used or lie to whatever source that's about that's what happens all the time. The media constantly gets used world would subvert the I don't know because agents that's what they don't that's how big leveraged bets they'd. They played they played teams off each other by going through the media at a time. Q why show after pissing about I. Why does it to just say look I'm Mike I'm tired I'm telling you what I've been told I am. He you know to just say I'm not here to speculate until you have been told that grappled be the backup quarterback in. In standby that instead of you know it sort of I'm not gonna go for are not gonna say any more of all those I know what you're asking me I'm not gonna go to absurd extremes to say. I'm I'm telling you what I'm told it if it turns out to be wrong that's on the people they tell me this. That's what 777 eyes 79370. Jerry York till 3 o'clock here's Peter JP up next here at WI LL Peter. I don't echo. On. Down but that's I don't says he I don't exactly will not like that during your theory is that what about the appearance not it's not great it's not crazy it's not crazy. Diawara for you what's safe space weary Europeans will be respected by all. Preceded concern. And a threat to this stage and when I only. Kurt and Callahan show. They have insisted we wouldn't be this surprised you didn't end your career it's a patriot. And it needs certain element of surprise me in India he restaurants or Montana. So. I'm saying at the end of next year or the year pastor. Are they good arms and listened to our. Two of these points are Super Bowls is going to answer you don't everything you're the greatest pastry you'll only Peter Graves patriot. Gonna send you do good situation may be closer on Cisco. Immediate judgment Iranians though idea of what utopia that actually I Rogers here. Are you I can see that in America are meant to harm. And outlook Gary Jerry does this look at a time frame Magnuson is is what a mask and six through years. Arabs. Even next year the year depending aren't. How Brady obviously Brady's so department game. I don't know what it sanctuary where are they might think he's an accident Rogers I want to connect standards. But it I think he's an ex Aaron Rodgers. And I don't think Tom would take it personally. You know you you might see it as a new challenge them you know from the Cisco. Under you know near my home. This is not a better way and smarter about everything any quarterback is never done a history of soapbox. You know I've always going to be good of the greatest patriot of all time crafted you know on that. Richie will be known Beers that are. But patrons are Brady there's no way. So you know it's that affords element in our city mayor saying. You know. Yeah out Peyton Manning is different and they did prompt the thing that's different about Brady is that he's getting better there's no sign of any decline that's the problem Peter now maybe that changed maybe takes a hit the regular season the jurors saw that. May be his. It it held that his numbers go about or you can start to see a downward trend but the people it's safe to stop a five or six years went as a gonna happen. And it's gotten it's the opposite that's happened. That's ludicrous and yup. What do they say. We go one year of the greatest quarterback and so while. We kind of ten years who will be I don't know what it lets you think you want to but we take it to code set. I mean. Well I think the electrical percent a lot for the reasons why we talked in order to do what Brady spoke as 37 touchdown passes next year it's expects. And brought proposed a 5000 yards and he would you know I mean and what's another Super Bowl what you do that what you gonna do that in any steady doesn't wanna retire what do you what do you do. 22 more great years. Tom Brady or ten years. You know eventually Wear well. I'm not say to me I don't we don't know lately you know six quarters via that it is being seen mixed. Peyton Manning and he didn't see any regrets. It and see any. Free agency will come in Namibia and worse it is. To link yet. Then into a movie might make I don't think Tom I don't think it would be could be amicable. Because in the universe saying. In this situation and I both agree error. And I news goes. God I'm a mutt and an old ugly daughter that is there's always get yeah this route it is but it doesn't trip out west and by the way happy birthday Nancy's sister Bertha yesterday. If it with interest reports all the anyway the job them I don't know I could exploit their relationships somehow I got I had to go through Q do horror and then go to the NFL offense look I think Australia I'd never was that by about about stuff that I. I feel the standard here should be and is who's gonna add to the collection of Lombardi trophies. And not so much who's going to be the quarterback in 2020. One who's got there for the foreseeable future. Who's gonna give us the best chance to win it clearly it's him if you look if you look at Brady's. Numbers that backs that up he threw two picks in twelve games this year in the super bully from 66. Times. And and 466. Yards away for a 69 yards. So eight but also physically he looks better than he has he moves better than he ever has and is he said. There's nothing that he defense can throw at him that he hasn't seen that he has all the answers to the test. I ride that guy until he has not the left in the tank. To me if he's got the twelfth highest passer rating in the NFL and a couple years and that'll I'll do some massage are right now there is no end in sight. Know my numbers ago admitting I love that went through this devastated for decades until you show me his touchdown interception ratio dropped low to one I don't wanna hear. I want to hear about a decline hasn't even been close to. A decline it and it's it's been done nothing but a lot Jose and what we're up next here WEEI repeat Jerry hey Joseph. Yes it's fifteen degrees if that's almost sixteen degrees on March 11. Added I lost also compliance to restore might fly out of now aren't very I watch a pointer and swear or more I'm short putt on street on Cowell cry in el Al. Chip. And eat it. A unit. The why can't count on each and like that you know aren't. Pot aren't at that art would be absolutely correct here I don't call him. Turn the ball. Yeah that's the thing though they don't they don't have to they just have to give him. You know let of a leveraged deal that extends them or let him play perform beyond just four million this year and you've got eight arguably. The top a top three quarterback can't absolutely socket. Hold out army navy may bust balls not sort of June 15 if it all plays out that way but. It always doctor go back to 660000. Dollars a year I don't think from three point 91 million. But you made it quite a statement Q how old or accident you know -- compete you know. Helped unintended but hurt you in an all out now on the I don't cossacks and perhaps seven billion call us. But an attitude on the. Well thank you wanted to pose a great Joseph show it to go but yeah that's that's the other thing is you got out is it going to be unhappy is going to be grumpy he's not gonna give his all. Are all that stuff this is gonna hurt him next year if he stays with the team wouldn't be the first time we've had this conversation about a patriots got that there. Clay and hard ball went I don't think they're playing hard I think they just go one by the leverage that they have put. We've done this before we said it apple will for Wilfork was made public declarations that he was unhappy double hull they wouldn't negotiating. Logan Mankins Lowe held outdoors O'Meara and at what happen. When those guys came back they came back and they played a grass soft because that's what great players do Malcolm Butler is footballer he's a competitor. Evil when he's get burned which is rare he's fighting on every single down that's part of what we love about him. I can't envision a scenario where he comes in envelopes or plays at half speed. All the contrail of every incentive to play as hard as he ever has because he knows that the big money is dangling under its weight in form at the end of the season. That's what 777 I'd seven ID 37 Charlie Crist aide Steve as you guys lined up at wide open line right now 617779. Seven got a 37 paycheck at Jerry thought that the house. Until three write your Sports Radio don't we. All new England sports topics discussed right now here's Maura. And carried Georgia punt Sports Radio WEEI. Not a good that the patriots are going to be given yeah. What you get on the open market I'm sure behind the scenes if they were to have a discussion right now with Malcolm bothered Beijing. And they said we'll do go forward deal the patriots say you know this is not an open market situation this is the restricted you know you lower that down. A little bit so that's always speaking in between players and agents and the patriots are always explored it. With their various players well. I might be willing to go winner early like Rob Gronkowski did. You know in 2012. So that's that's always happening and that's that's the whether it's Colin I don't know it's specifically apple with its. But is being Boston's Mike Reese yesterday with the old buffers and I just does say and them. All the guys around him girls are torn about I think an awesome shop no matter what affiliate I mean you Garrett Mike Greece or body of ESPN. A boss who's won the best at Tommy current. My QRD field Perry phenomenal stuff over at the over Comcast's. Carol agree yen Jeff hollow the W I I got a GI guy forget that that's a dividend declared the road at every sordid affair tat I know everybody wants to be first I get it I mean I understand that by. Overall I think all the stories locally and not about all of this and it's it's. You know it's. It's fun for them might go but it's also like you it's the year you're trying to keep up with the at a bar stool. It's color in my committee try to get all the details are pretty wants to have the first part. I think every point all you guys do that's for not right at the information as to bottom all these. The reports that you get instantaneously it's a very impressive. And you just keep thinking all right the patriots had done Macon lose. And eat your free to take a bathroom break because you know you turn around and they make it another giant splash unexpected things. The two days we have done nothing but sit there riveted to NFL network. And trying to get this stuff as soon as it content. It was all it could do yesterday to find about an hour to write a tribute to the twentieth anniversary of one of my top five all time TV shows. Buffy the Vampire Slayer. If you feel that old well there. Feel older just I was last night through every single episodes ago that never seen it before all you'll do yourself a favor it is. It's so multi layered it so Smart. It's got a hot chicks it's funny that dialogue is incredible. It is unique in all the world twenty years ago today it came on ice the VHS it. That's how. How old I I am now and you kids out there rescue parents wouldn't be any chances I'll be beyond that I'd done nothing but just stay glued because. There's so many things that a party gone on. And his giant pieces to still be determined here as you know we still don't know about hightower we stole wildly like you for a grapple and deal. And the Butler I think a week for a pronouncement a wait for something. Definitive sump and I can go on I want the player to come out and say whether he's happy or unhappy or whatever. Because everything is big and people put words in his moll. Attach it emotions film that we don't know if they exist. The patriots are absolutely for the center of the NFL offseason like. But it it's as if they haven't won two Super Bowls in the last three years they appear to make it moves left and right. And of I'm with you Pete from another NFL GM I'm terrified of the phone rang and it's Belichick on the other end. I'm terrified that text messages are getting 44 patriot player and it's not for its gross ST via sea. Sickness that any going anywhere I am glad. And had some other insult of us. Take it because I know by Hutus are going anyway. At Tenet wanted to urban grapple all go okay activities are quarter. This. Will slip will say let's let it play out longer can you give me into this next player outside of the art. He's Atlanta when a guy membership has its privileged guys listen if you guys are on the outside. I get a seat at the table of an insider. Chosen Chicopee up next here on WEEI repeat manager Charlie. There would be dangerous. And it's happening. Legends cars that projected it looks up. At that could be correct. Why out pretty Caroline. A latex in Delhi. That would shift the body text anyway text unites us we all hours of the morning are pops into his little minds and we text. That. God is a great he's a great guy like simply be sending you sent us a message I felt I missed the broke Lisa's mom used to Nixon and it's the big shall back Austin but anyway it. Continued. I'd almost to do another possibility about how come they kept Russia around all year and put him on IR. With brought almost an impending contract situation. They really have to use last year to expedite percent to valuation. They couldn't waste the yes they ought to find out okay do we have a possible replacement here aren't you re not. In this from you take Schechter edits face value that drop was not going anywhere knife and had so liked about this they got their answer. Why he's got the audience Jeff does not alone in saying exactly that corner where broad Borges said that last week is aptly knuckle anywhere ago. Calgary you know I had on last week she doesn't think that he's going anywhere. But. But I'd I'd I don't know this is so much this too much other. It's just too much out the airport to say absolutely definitely not there's too many draft picks for the browns as a screwed up situation. With Washington. It all nobody no police other Steven Gilmore thing in common not buy the longest of shots though. Just not ready I am not going to be entirely convinced that Jimmy gee isn't going anywhere it's always been told. You know that is until September 7. Should not a not salute bought. If it is going to be different if the speculation is that they had respect all last year and watch them in the look at madam. And Belichick would consult component units a year. And he wants to have a viable backup if you actually said that one point that's sort of the most important things you can have on your roster are. Is a viable backup and if he doesn't think percent fit then. It may be true that grapples going nowhere and action. Absolutely a third and and it very well over rook to predict the colts are over Roger I'm beginning so you know wrap my. Rain around the I am willing to open up my mind and accept the possibility that grapples going to be here in 2017. Doesn't make sense to me but then everything they have done has gone against the grain of what they usually do so. But then I ask you the question what happens. In 2018. Because they can't. Keep them unless he's a starting quarterback. Might Lennon. Got fourteen and a half million dollars might lead was we said that last week Barack I think he's gonna get you turned out this guy. Couple weeks ago turn down seven million because he knew all the quarterbacks are going to be at a pre amp. Seconds left third string guy turned down several million dollars a year with. So I had wrecked at W by the not stomach disease that know enough to double my. I can double that opera. He's making more money next year about this I brought this up that might let makes more money next year that Aaron Rodgers doesn't want it based Allard. I don't know who is right. Eight inches but that man's genius that man deserves the Nobel prize in ejecting because. Mike glad it has less than 60% completion percentage his yards per attempt not yards per completion yards per attempt it was like six and a half. Put god bless them he gambled on himself and so I'm gonna go all the market because I know somebody out there is dumb enough to sign a fourteen and a half million. Per year. So if you grow up blow. Is there any scenario where you are not starting quarterback in the NFL the year after next scenario. Oh that a lot Brady retires. And they keep our Brady retires I just wanted a tickets to real popular Rogers Rogers would on an ESPN Wisconsin affiliate earlier this week as well what the glut and stored broke. And it was asked flat out is like you are you know he's only going to be. Our seventh on the less of something like that highest paid quarterbacks who wants to be in a pot to base wants to be in the top three. But he wasn't he was. Is like it's something to that to talk about it Ellington denied that it was kind of like well why would I met three negotiable but they were Green Bay shore up. And it's all he's been working for a discount all these years he's been a real one of the top three highest paid quarterbacks throughout and he deserves to be in he's got the leverage still. And you know if if your ground below you want it on that. And for anybody to suggest that he would stay here for back up money your your item. I and yet again all the contention is that he does get dealt obviously he has to you have to be. An agreement where he is decide want to system to store the brunt of the states the browse for whatever reason nicotine. But say it's the browns obviously they're not gonna give a page so in eldest is god father rock for whatever you wanna call it. A significant offer for drop low without knowing that he is gonna side there. You know long term and that's where he got a what's Jimmy gee thank goodness you weigh the pros and cons to wannabe starter right away which for all think he does absolutely. And this is why I I don't. I don't see him being comfortable and another possibly three years sitting on the bench and not sniping. The light of day up at about a significant football game except for blowouts and three season it's there in oh assuming Brady stays. Healthy reasonably healthy how I took the stage and grapple with three years in a row like sitting on the bench. Hold the clipboard get up once awhile talkative Belichick and Brady and shoot the breeze it's I don't see it. I'd I'd kick I cannot. That doesn't compute with me. Are got a quick breaks it's what 77797937. Get your treading speech got the script dates you guys all lined up pick secretary Gordon happily all. We're so afraid identical car comes in a sports writer W Riyadh.

Delicious new meaning 0 Mar 11, 2017 1:00 PM by: Vin Greco Vin Greco, Wine All The Time Commonly, we think of Murphy’s Law as the adage, “If something can go wrong, it will”; however, when it comes to Moonshine and getting it right, just turn to Murphy’s Law Distillery in Elmira Ontario, and ‘Murphy’s Law’ gets a whole new meaning. Right next to Jack Daniel’s Honey in the LCBO, you’ll find a mason jar and in it resides Murphy’s Law Apple Pie Moonshine, with 22 per cent alcohol. If you’ve never tried Moonshine, this is a darn good introduction. Ben Murphy was a really good cross-country runner, so good that he earned a scholarship to a good Christian university in West Virginia in the heart of the Appalachians. It was there that he was introduced to the “traditions” of the region, which included the honourable – but illegal - private production of corn liquor – in other words, “Moonshine”.  Including his “apprenticeship”, Ben now has seven years’ experience in the craft. Ben, who has a degree in Psychology, had intended to enter police services, but the accidental loss of hearing on his right side took away that option. Eventually he decided to fall back on the “avocation” he had acquired at school, and now 3 years after graduation, he has been operating for the past two years– legally - the only distillery in Ontario totally devoted to the production of Moonshine. To do that he has had to secure three licenses: one with Canada Revenue, one with the Ontario Alcohol and Gaming Commission, and one with the LCB0. How well is he doing? Let’s just say that at the 2016 New York International Spirits Competition, Murphy's Law was named the Canadian Moonshine Distillery of the Year, and his Apple Pie Moonshine took a bronze medal, this in a competition that included 600 entrants. Moonshine is un-aged 100 per cent corn liquor, and it is the only spirit produced by the Murphy’s Law Distillery. In addition to his straight White Lightnin’, Ben produces a number of flavoured examples, of which the Apple Pie on the LCBO general List is the most readily available. Ben explained that this is produced with the introduction of apple cider, primarily from Royal Gala apples, and the flavour is true and delicious. With a business that has been going for just a year or two, and using equipment that he has been able to cobble together, Ben has scrambled to get things up and running, including buying apple cider off the shelves for his Apple Pie Moonshine. A little while ago he was explaining to a man at one of the public shows how he was using Cider from Martin’s Family Fruit Farm in the St. Jacob’s area, buying jug after jug after jug to meet his needs. The man handed him his business card – he was President of Martin’s. He told Ben, “You know, you are right across the road from where we press our apples. Why don’t you just bring over your vats and we will fill them – you don’t have to be clearing out all our jugs!” Ben, half-laughing, said, ”We may even get to the point where we will just run a pipe across the road!” As to the size of production, Ben indicated that in the past three weeks, he had sent two consignments each of 1,000 jars to the LCBO, and one of them had already sold out. In addition to the LCBO, Murphy’s Law also sells to New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland. All of the Moonshines produced by Murphy’s Law are very clean, and smooth. The flavoured varieties are subtle, but satisfying, and come across very much like eau-de-vies as opposed to sweet liqueurs. They are easy-sipping and very pleasurable. While I enjoy sipping, Ben shared the Appalachian approach – “Shine, not Wine – Knock it Back and You’ll be Fine!” The Apple Pie retails for $30 for a 750 ml jar. In addition, other ‘Shines include Peach Pie, Cherry Bomb, Sweet Tea and Caramel, with Firewater, a cinnamon product, a new addition to the line-up. His pure, unflavoured White Lightnin’, is also $30 a jar.  It has a touch of sweetness on the palate, a natural characteristic of corn liquor, and just one taste is enough for you to understand why Moonshine might be so popular in Appalachia. A short while ago the LCBO put out a call to the Ontario Craft Distillery Association for a caramel flavoured “white lightning”, and Ben has come up with a winner. With the Caramel example, Ben suggested breathing out after you swallow it, and that really increased the “butterscotch” impact. This is one of the ‘Shines that Ben intends to have available in select stores: this will depend on the decision of the store manager to carry it. Elmira is an important Ontario hub for Maple Syrup, and so one of Murphy’s Law spirits is Lady Maple, which retails for $27.50 for the half-bottle. Here the Maple flavour is intentionally heightened.  While I might not put it on my pancakes, I would be very happy to sip a glass…maybe even after breakfast! One other product that Ben is involved in is called Moondance. While not strictly a Murphy’s Law product, it is distinct, in that it is a “pre-Bourbon distillate – a blend of 3 grains: corn, barley and wheat, and the difference is evident in the taste. You start to get more of the flavours we associate with whiskies, but as with all the Murphy’s Law ‘Shines, it is a nuanced experience.  It retails for $40 for 750 ml. Along with the Caramel, Moonshine, Ben hopes to have both “White Lightnin’ and Moondance available soon in select LCBO stores as well. Otherwise, contact Murphy’s Law Distillery at 519-669-2500 to learn about how you might acquire some excellent ‘Shine. If you live in the region, you can visit the Distillery at 90 Earl Martin Drive in Elmira.  They are open Wednesday through Sunday - from 1 to 9 through Friday, 11 to 8 on Saturday, and Sundays from 2 until 6 p.m. Just this week, the provincial government announced the dedication of $4.9 million dollars over three years to support the fledgling cider and distillery industry in Ontario – similar to its support of micro-breweries. Ben thinks this is a step in the right direction.  Ben has already ordered new stills which will increase his output, and if current production and calibre of product are any indication, we can expect Murphy’s Law to rule for some time in the realm of moonshine north of the 49th Parallel. General List South Africa continues to provide us with good wines at great prices.  In the past, I have recommended Boschendal’s ‘The Pavillion’ Chenin Blanc/Viognier blend at just $10.90. Recently I tried the companion red blend, ‘The Pavillion’ Shiraz/Cabernet Sauvignon 2015, $11.95.  This dark purple wine shows some spice on the nose, good dark fruit, and a definite tannic burr on the finish. It would match up well with grilled meats, so think of it when you’ve been able to dig your barbecues out of the snow.  There’s a lot of ‘oomph’ at play here, so give it a try if you can.  In the Sault and North Bay you might have to have it ordered in, but you won’t be disappointed if you do. Bellingham’s Big Oak Red 2015, also $11.95, provides a lesson in contrast.  A similar blend, it also contains some Malbec.  Slightly lighter in colour, this blend carries just slightly more residual sugar, and it seems to have a softening impact.  Mid-weight and tasty, this is easier-going over-all and would be a good sipper for social gatherings.  The “Big Oak” refers to a tree, not to the style of wine, so expect gentle, smooth, and flavourful. March 18 Vintages Release There’s an interesting selection of Sauvignon Blancs on this release, beginning with the Pérez Cruz Reserva 2015, $14.95, from Chile’s Casablanca Valley.  This is a new listing, and perhaps a new wine to the Pérez Cruz stable, as they don’t even mention it on their website.  Vintages only suggests that the long growing season common to the region allows for ripe flavours and “balancing vibrancy and freshness.”  Considering the breadth of styles world-wide, this could be worth checking out. South Africa’s Rustenberg Stellenbosch Sauvignon Blanc 2015, $14.95, earned an 89 from robertparker.com which remarked on the “crisp entry with white peach and passionfruit notes, a fine line of acidity, and a lively lightly spice finish.” The Wine Enthusiast gives its approval with a 90 to Eradus Sauvignon Blanc 2015, $18.95 from New Zealand.  They say it has the leafy herbal character typical of the region, the Awatere Valley in Marlborough, with that character balanced by melon and fig.  It is “verging on full-bodied, even a touch oily in texture, with a long vibrant finish.” Robert Mondavi Fumé Blanc 2014, $22.95, hails from the Napa Valley, and is made in a style that Mondavi popularized by introducing judicious oak aging which, along with the slight addition of Semillon softens the ultimate impact. The nose has all the hallmarks of Sauvignon Blanc with a nuanced muskiness, but in this style the deep flavours are harmonized, with the finish bringing more herbal overtones rather than in-your-face acidity. This is seriously good. Switching varietals, Cave Spring Estate Chardonnay 2014, $18.95 from Niagara’s Beamsville Bench is lovely from the first sip with fine balance and flavour. It pulls all elements of flavour, weight, and acidity together with some apple and toast notes, as well as minerality discernible on the finish. From Italy comes Piedmont Wine Project Asinel Bianco 2013, $15.95.  This is an intriguing blend of Cortese, Arneis, and Moscatel Secco, with the wines brought together from various producers, almost in an “Assemblage” style, and then blended and aged on its lees for about four months.  Flavours of orchard fruits such as peach, pear and apple, along with a slight herbal note can be detected. Alberto Cordero di Montezemolo of Barolo fame is behind the project, seeking to make wines that are “accessible, aromatic, seductive and youthful.” Red Wines Australia’s Zonte’s Footstep Avalon Tree Cabernet Sauvignon 2014, $17.95, should be impressive. Tastings.com calls it “exceptional” and gives it a 95. Among the many descriptors  given are “mocha, caramelized roasted nuts…spiced craisins and blueberries, chocolate cherries, sun dried tomato…A fine savory cabernet for the table.” From the southwest of France we have Domaine Lafage Tessellaae Vieilles Vignes Carignan 2014, $17.95.  According to robertparker.com, “It offers tons of black raspberry and black cherry fruit, licorice and dried spices to go with a super sexy, heady seamless style on the palate that keeps you coming back to the glass.”  92. There are many fine Italian reds in the $17 range on this release. Campomoro Barbera Piemonte 2013, $16.95 is “pliant, intense and rich – but never heavy according to vinous.com.  Antonio Galloni calls it juicy and indicated that “sweet floral notes add freshness to the red cherry and plum flavours.”  92 For Ripasso lovers, Storia Antica Ripasso Valpolicella Superiore 2014, $17.95, should bring much pleasure.  Natalie MacLean calls it a great wine, “savoury, dark and delicious.” 91 If you want to give yourself a treat, then try a bottle of Ravenswood Dickerson Zinfandel 2013, $39.95, from the Napa Valley.  From a special site on Zinfandel Lane, the wine is made from vines 31 to 86 years of age.  Ravenswood calls it its most elegant single vineyard zinfandel, and I can believe it. It is a deep garnet in colour, and on the nose you can detect both spice and the heady alcohol – it is 14.9 per cent.  But it is the way it unfolds on your palate that can mesmerize you. When you take the wine into your mouth, it is very quiet, seamless and pure. Then, as you swallow, the flavours roll out, deep, rich and long. Only on the finish do you detect the lovely tannins, and all you want is another sip. And another sip. And another sip. Go for it.   See a typo/mistake?

Photograph: Olivia Solon for the Guardian Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Olivia Solon Saturday 11 March 2017 12.33 EST Last modified on Sunday 12 March 2017 12.29 EDT A quest taken up by farmers and independent repair shops to gain the rights to service manuals, diagnostic tools and parts for hi-tech equipment has stalled in Nebraska, after lawmakers, under pressure from corporations such as Apple, shelved it. The “Fair Repair” bill was designed to give owners increased rights over the software-embedded equipment and electronic items they purchase. Farmers have been pushing for such legislation so they can diagnose and fix faults in their increasingly computer-controlled tractors and combine harvesters, in the same way that car owners can do. To do this, they need diagnostic tools and manuals that the manufacturers keep closely guarded. A right to repair: why Nebraska farmers are taking on John Deere and Apple Read more Nebraska was perceived as a test case in the US, where seven other states – including New York, Massachusetts, Illinois, Wyoming, Tennessee, Minnesota and Kansas – have similar bills. Opponents to the bill, mainly the large companies that make and sell equipment, including John Deere, Case IH, and Apple, and associated industry bodies, argue that allowing a broader set of people to access diagnostic tools creates safety, security and intellectual property risks. The bill, LB67, had a public hearing at 1.30pm on Thursday, but 90 minutes before it started, supporters knew it was dead in the water. Noon was the deadline for senators to declare a single bill as their priority for the parliamentary session. The bill’s sponsor, state senator Lydia Brasch, had already pledged to prioritize another piece of legislation. She had hoped another senator was going to take on Fair Repair as a priority but that senator did not act. “We walked into the hearing with the bill dead,” said Gay Gordon-Byrne, executive director of the Repair Association, which has been fighting for the right to repair in states across the US. “That’s why the senators were so disengaged. They wanted to get through the hearing.” Gordon-Byrne believes senators may have balked at the broadness of the bill: it covers not only agricultural equipment, but any electronic product with embedded software, including home appliances, consumer electronics and medical devices. She hasn’t given up hope and expects another version of the bill to be introduced next year. “It’s discouraging for the people who have been working on this so hard, but it’s only a skirmish in a bigger war. On balance, we gained a bit of awareness, so we didn’t lose.” A similar blow was dealt in Minnesota, where the measure didn’t even get a committee hearing. “Lobbyists got to the chairman of the committee,” Gordon-Byrne said. During the Nebraska hearing, Brasch, Gordon-Byrne, farmers and independent repair shops spoke out about their desires to have the ability to diagnose, repair and maintain increasingly hi-tech equipment. They argued that with diagnostic tools given only to a limited set of authorized repair shops, consumers lose time and money. This is particularly critical for farmers, whose livelihoods depend on their tractors’ ability to run during planting, harvesting and other key points in the growing cycle. “Time is lost. Farmers depend on weather situations and help is hard to find. So when you have it, it’s imperative you keep the equipment going,” said Brasch, who also works as a software consultant and is married to a farmer. Opponents to the bill who testified during the hearing included a variety of bodies for the technology industry, including the Consumer Technology Association, the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association, known as CTIA, and CompTIA, the Computing Technology Industry Association. “This has the potential to weaken security features in a host of electronic devices. It’s not about dead screen or battery,” said CompTIA’s Alexi Madon, adding that the bill applied to medical equipment and government servers. “Manufacturers are also required to give up sensitive intellectual property.” Tony Baker, a Nebraska politician who previously provided information solutions to the US military, countered the suggestion that repair rights would infringe on the intellectual property rights and the security of software. He explained how his organization created software running on classified networks that granted different levels of access to different groups of people, depending on their level of authorisation or security clearance. He argued that manufacturers could do the same with their products. “The bottom line is [there are] a very large variety of engineering solutions to accommodate these issues that could be put in place,” he said. Pro-repair advocates are waiting for the bill to be discussed in other states in the coming months. Gordon-Byrne believes that without the lobbying clout of their opponents, it is going to be an uphill struggle. “As much as people say lobbyists are professional shit talkers, it’s good to have one on your side.” Topics Nebraska Farming news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

You’ll get the most value by starting at the beginning, however you can also use the series overview if you’d like to go buffet style. Note for regular readers, the already tech savvy, and IT professionals: this series is designed as a resource you can share with those you are helping or for those looking to become tech savvy on their own. Updating software on your Mac Background, Expectations, & Best Practices Staying up to date with software can sometimes be a confusing and frustrating task, these issues are usually caused by the various ways that different software is designed to update and where it was installed from. The good news is that Apple is continually improving how updates happen. With its latest operating system, macOS Sierra, there are some sharp features to make updating software more smooth and seamless. This won’t apply in all instances, but still helps provide an overall improved user experience. AirPods First, let’s define some of the vocabulary we’ll be using. We’ll refer to software as the applications (programs), operating system (macOS) and other operating information used by your Mac hardware. In the last several years using app (short for application) has become more common than using program when referring to software. We’ll define apps as computer software designed and written to fulfill a particular purpose. There are different ways to install and update apps on your Mac, the most common ways are the Mac App Store, within the app itself, or the web. Less commonly you may see apps that are loaded from flash drives or CD’s. Concerns about updates A common concern that is often shared is that updating apps and especially operating systems will cause a problem. Often times this fear is caused by the past experience of an issue after doing an update or hearing stories from others. This is definitely up to personal preference, but here are a couple of things to keep in mind… App and operating system updates typically provide bug fixes, security updates, and introduce new features. While it’s possible that installing an update may cause an issue, it’s also possible that not installing the update could cause problems. This is a good reminder that anything can fail and you should have a backup strategy in place. Even robust systems that power the internet like Amazon Web Services can and do fail. As a general rule of thumb, I typically install updates as soon as they are available. However, if you’re a bit more hesitant, you can wait a week or two to see if others run into any problems and then continue on performing updates. Just don’t wait too long as this can cause more security and compatibility issues the longer you postpone. From my experience there seems to be a bit more anxiety with software updates for iPhones than Macs. This is likely because we rely on our smartphones so much and it can feel crippling to not have our primary communication device functioning normally. Next week we’ll dive into updating software on iOS (iPhone and iPad) in particular. Another way to think about updates is it’s like driving a car. The possibility of being in an accident doesn’t stop you from traveling in your vehicle, you just likely use your safety belt, have insurance, and drive intentionally to reduce the risks. Do This Let’s dive deeper and look at updating within macOS and the App Store and then we’ll take a look at updating within apps and through the web. Follow along to build experience, exposure, and confidence with updating apps. The App Store in macOS To launch the App Store, click the blue, round icon with the ‘A’ in your Dock (if you don’t see the icon in your Dock, click on Finder → Applications → App Store). As shown in the photo below, you’ll notice the red badge with a number when updates are available. When you first open the App Store it will show you the Featured page. In the top middle area of your screen, click on Updates. Now your screen should look like the image below. At the top of the window you’ll see the updates that are available to install. The App Store in macOS will automatically let you know when updates are available, but it won’t install them without your authorization (you can also change these settings, which we’ll get to in a moment). If you have multiple updates available you can click Update All in the top right hand corner, or choose to update individual apps. Note that the description will share what the update includes, click More to see the full details. Below your available updates you’ll see Updates Installed in the Last 30 Days. macOS system updates, Apple applications, and any third-party apps downloaded from the App Store will show up here. You can click on Purchased in top area of the App Store window to see all of your purchases (which includes free downloads as well). To look at or change your macOS and apps update settings, click on App Store in the menu bar and then click Preferences… You’ll now be able to make sure your settings are to your liking. Even if you check off all the boxes and allow macOS and the App Store to automatically check for and download updates, you’ll still be notified and have to authorize their installation. But again, these settings will come down to your personal preferences. Below the update preferences you’ll notice a manual Check Now button that you can use in conjunction with the auto-check for updates feature or use on its own if you prefer to turn that feature off. The current macOS version is Sierra, if you notice that you’re not on Sierra, it is a free update from the App Store. Sometimes with older Macs the newest operating system may run a bit slower, but as an example my parents are running Sierra on a 2009 iMac with solid performance. Apple does a fantastic job optimizing macOS with their hardware. If you’d like to install macOS Sierra you can check your Mac against the operating system requirements (click on the  in the top left corner → About This Mac to see your Macs details). If you’d like to move forward, pull up Sierra on the App Store. Don’t forget to backup your Mac before installing a new operating system. Click on Featured in the top middle area of the App Store window and then look on the middle right hand side for macOS Sierra (or you can search in the top right corner). Now you’ll be able to download Sierra. Note that downloading the new macOS operating system won’t automatically install it, you can do that whenever you’d like as they are two separate steps. As you can see, when you choose to download your applications through the App Store it makes the process of updating much easier and more organized. Another benefit of utilizing the App Store is that Apple vets and approves all the apps available so you can rest assured that they are safe and work as described. Some app developers will offer downloads through their website and the App Store, only the App Store, or sometimes only through the web. Let’s take a look at updating an app that didn’t come from the App Store. Updating apps downloaded from the web The first example we’ll look at is a piece of third-party software that I had to download from Logitech’s website for my wireless mouse (far and away the best I’ve used). Because I downloaded it directly from the manufacturer I can’t use the App Store to help with updates. The following will apply to most apps you download from the web but may vary a bit app to app… Click on the application name in the menu bar (top left) and look for Update Software. You’ll find it there in many applications, but you’ll notice below it’s not showing up for this application. The next step is to look for settings or something similar in the application window. In this case Logitech has placed the update settings under the More button. You’ll notice on the right hand side in the image above that I have the option for the Logitech app to auto-check for updates as well as a manual button. When an update is available, here is what it looks like… Even though the updates don’t come through the App Store, third-party update notifications still come through the macOS system, and give an option to Close and skip or install the update. This particular app update does so directly to the app and doesn’t include any downloads or files in your Downloads folder. Let’s look at one last example where the update process is a bit clunkier. Adobe Flash Player Some applications like Adobe’s Flash Player may redirect you to the their website to download an update. This type of update also usually includes downloading a .dmg (disk image) mounting it, installing the update, un-mounting the .dmg and deleting the download. Taking the time to follow the steps below will make sure you stay up to date with your apps as well as making sure your downloaded files don’t pile up. Here’s what this process looks like: Once you’ve clicked the download link or button on the website that the app has taken you to (make sure it’s a legitimate site) you can click on the down arrow with small status bar icon in the top right corner in Safari (in Chrome it’s in the bottom left corner) and you’ll see the progress of the download. When the download is complete, you can find it in your Downloads folder. By default this is the right hand side of your Dock. You can also find it by clicking on Finder and then Downloads. Double-click on the file you downloaded (it will usually have install in the file name and have a .dmg file extension). After double-clicking the .dmg (disk image) it will mount and you should see it appear in the upper right hand corner of your screen and you should see a new window open with an install package/icon. Double-click on the Install Adobe Flash Player or similar icon that you see with the software you’re updating. macOS will ask you to verify that you’d like to open the installation application and provide information of the source, click Open. Next, click INSTALL to complete the update. The last step of this particular process includes choosing future update preferences. Allow Adobe to install updates (recommended) was the default, but I prefer to use the Notify me to install updates option. Click DONE to complete the process. Here are the last two steps… Right click on the mounted disk image like the picture shows above and click Eject “Flash Player.” The last step is to delete the installation download. Right click on the file, and click Move to Trash. Alternately you can left click to select the file and then use the keyboard by pressing ⌘ command – delete. After going through these three different ways to check and perform updates, you should be able to tackle any updates that you encounter. Because you might not have updates to take care of now, it may be helpful to bookmark this article and return to it when needed.

RBC on Tuesday launched free money transfers using the voice command feature on Apple’s iPhone and iPad for its personal banking clients. After updating the mobile app, RBC customers can say, “Hey Siri, send Dave $1” and the virtual assistant will confirm the name from the payee list send the amount, the bank says. “It’s our goal to continue to be part of the everyday mobile experiences of our clients by adding more convenient and seamless ways to send money and bank with RBC,” said Sean Amato-Gauci, executive vice-president of digital payments and cards for RBC, in a statement. Related Teaching virtual assistants new tricks: Why Google, Microsoft and Amazon love the sound of your voice Your relationship with artificial intelligence will soon determine whether you’ll be a have or a have-not RBC is also working with Apple to introduce e-transfers using iMessage, the bank’s chief executive Dave McKay told analysts on Feb. 23. “These types of initiatives reflect our commitment to making banking easier and integrating RBC into the everyday mobile experiences of our clients,” he said on the call to discuss the lender’s latest quarterly earnings. This comes as more and more Canadians look to their laptops and smartphones rather than a physical branch to do their banking. The proportion of Canadians who bank primarily on a mobile device has risen to 17 per cent from nine per cent two years ago, according to a survey released last month by the Canadian Bankers Association. Nearly three-quarters of Canadians surveyed primarily do their banking online or on their mobile device, compared to 52 per cent in 2012. In the latest quarter, McKay told analysts, almost 70 per cent of their customers’ service transactions were done through self-service channels. Canada’s biggest lender had nearly 6 million active digital users during that period as well, he added.

 A teen programmer met Apple's Tim Cook and Craig Federighi then built an app to improve your commute Julie Bort Mar. 11, 2017, 11:15 AM 20,515 facebook linkedin twitter email print Tim Cook and Michael Royzen Michael Royzen Michael Royzen, a 17-year-old high school student living in Seattle, has been coding since he was 12 and loves it so much, he's certain that he's going to do it for a living one day. He's off to a good start. He was part of a team of kids that won the 2015 TechGLOBAL Civic Hackathon for an app called VoicePedia, which reads Wikipedia entries aloud for the visually impaired. It's available on Apple's App Store. The second app of his to be accepted into the App Store was a derivative called RecipeReadr, which reads your recipes aloud. It cost $1.99 and has had a couple thousand downloads, so far, Royzen tells us. That was enough of a commercial success to land him a scholarship to Apple's 2016 Worldwide Developer's Conference teen program, where he briefly met Apple CEO Tim Cook and Apple's famed senior vice president of Software Engineering Craig Federighi in what he describes as a "life changing" event. A few years ago, Apple didn't allow teen programmers into its conferences at all. As we previously reported, one of the most famous Apple teen coders was John Meyer who invented the flashlight app Just Light for the iPhone 4 (before Apple integrated a flashlight feature into iOS). He followed that up with a hugely successful app called Perfect Shot. When Mayer was 16, he had to sneak into WWDC, getting his father to get a pass for him. (Meyer is now in his early 20's and running his own citizen journalism startup, Fresco News.) Today, however, Apple welcomes young programmers with open arms via its WWDC scholarship program. Apple gives about 400 kids a free pass to the conference (and will even help pay for travel for a handful of them). They attend special programming where they can meet other kid programmers and get feedback on their work from Apple employees. Apple just opened up applications for its 2017 scholarship program. Michael Royzen Michael Royzen Hands-on inspiration Tim Cook always makes an appearance with the teen scholarship winners at WWDC. When Royzen met him, he was both star struck and inspired, he says. "I felt so much appreciation. This is the man who makes my work possible. I asked him to sign my iPhone. I look at the signature to push myself harder as a developer and even as a human." But it was an interaction with Federighi that really influenced him. The head of software spent a few minutes talking to Royzen about his work and some of Apple's new dev tools. The result is Royzen's latest app called Ryde, which will helps you manage your daily commute so you always arrive on time. Royzen built it because he noticed that some days it took him longer to get to school than other days, he said. While iOS and Google Now will both tell you when to leave for an appointment in your calendar, that doesn't work for stuff you don't put into your calendar like your daily commute or your trips to the gym, your kid's daycare center, etc.  This app checks traffic, tells you when to leave and also the fastest route to get there each time.  "It uses some of the new Maps APIs that were released and the new design language that was announced," Royzen says. "I built it using the inspiration I got from Craig Federighi and Tim Cook." Michael Royzen Michael Royzen Ryde hasn't gone crazy with downloads yet, but it's gotten some nice reviews. More importantly, Royzen's experience represents how far Apple has come in its encouragement of kid coders. The interaction with Federighi was a particular highlight, because the exec talked one-on-one with them. "Having that short conversation, I could tell how passionate he was about his work and how dedicated he was to building high quality products," Royzen said. He was also left with the sense that these two powerful men were not just smart, they were also "humble," he said and left this young programmer with "a burning desire to do more." Given all the recent news of bad behavior among some techies, which makes all of Silicon Valley sound like a frat house, Royzen's simple ambition to work hard and be humble is a breath of fresh air.  SEE ALSO: Programmers in the Valley are pressuring their friends to quit working at Uber NOW WATCH: A body-language expert analyzes Trump's unique handshakes Loading video...

GEORGE March 11, 2017 21:52 IST Updated: March 11, 2017 21:53 IST more-in The FBI procured a court order directing Apple to help break the encryption. When it comes to surveillance, American security agencies never appear to err on the side of moderation. Last Tuesday, whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks published what are purportedly software tools that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has been using to hack into phones, computers, smart TVs and even cars. Among other things, the exposé claimed, the CIA has the capability to listen to conversations in a living room where a smart TV is on sleep mode and intrude into computer controls of a car and make it crash. The CIA has refused to comment on the authenticity of the leaked documents. It is also unclear whether it has been using these tools to spy on Americans. But nothing is beyond imagination in the secret world of American surveillance. Last December, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) even wiretapped a conversation between an incoming National Security Adviser and the Russian Ambassador to the U.S. According to WikiLeaks, it received the documents from a source who “wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyber weapons”. American intelligence agencies claim to operate within the limits of established laws and procedures, but those claims have been belied quite often. The WikiLeaks exposé claims that the CIA has the capability to access communication by intercepting it before encryption at the source or after decryption at the receiving end. The FBI has been lamenting that it cannot break into encrypted information and wants a law that will force technology companies to help it break the encryption, a move the companies have been resisting. The debate on balancing privacy concerns with public security has gained momentum in America after encryption became a common feature in mass communication equipment and apps since late 2014. The issue came to a head in December 2015, when the FBI tried to force Apple to break the encryption on an iPhone used by one of the two terrorists who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. The FBI procured a court order directing Apple to help break the encryption. Apple went on to appeal the order, questioning the decision on constitutional grounds. However, before the appeals court could rule on the matter, the FBI managed to break the encryption. The particular case was resolved, but what remains unresolved is the question whether the state has the power to force a company to break its encryption. Tools under the law “Until late 2014, neither Apple nor Google made phones that law enforcement could not open,” FBI director James Comey said last year at a public lecture. Appearing before a Congressional committee, Mr. Comey said subsequently: “It is our job to tell the American people... the tools you are counting on us to keep you safe are becoming less and less effective... We only use the tools that are given to us under the law.” He further warned the lawmakers that in the not so distant future, “the logic of encryption will bring us to a place where there will be warrant-proof” spaces in America. While both the CIA and the FBI have been caught on the wrong foot for alleged excesses, they believe the legal architecture in the U.S. is too archaic to deal with the rapid advances in technology. They want a new legal framework to rebalance security and privacy concerns even as civil right groups fear that America has become a surveillance state. Technology companies on the other hand argue that any government pressure to weaken encryption will be bad for capitalism and democracy.

Timothy Green, Tyler Crowe, and Beth McKenna (TMFBargainBin) Mar 11, 2017 at 9:46AM With a massive, growing economy and a ballooning middle class, China represents a major opportunity for many American companies. Here's why Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Cheniere Energy (NYSEMKT:LNG) are well-positioned to benefit from the continued rise of China.  The world's most beloved entertainment company Beth McKenna (Walt Disney): I can't think of a better way to profit from the ever-rising number of Chinese citizens joining the middle class than to invest in Disney stock. Last June, the legendary entertainment giant opened its first theme park in mainland China, the massive $5.5 billion Shanghai Disney, as it aims to capture the ballooning disposable dollars of many Chinese consumers.  So far, Disney Shanghai's results have surpassed the company's expectations. The park had hosted more than 7 million guests at the time of the company's first-quarter earnings call on Feb. 8. Disney's management has said on the last two quarterly earnings calls that the park is expected to come very close to breaking even in fiscal 2017, which is impressive given how new it is and its humongous cost to build. This, of course, means that the park should start contributing to Disney's profits in fiscal 2018. Disney Shanghai. Image source: Disney. Disney has been delighting people in the Western world for generations with its iconic theme parks, as well as its movies, TV shows, and dizzying array of consumer products. So, there's every reason to believe that the Chinese people and visitors to China will come to love Disney Shanghai just as much as Americans and visitors to the United States adore Disneyland and Disney World. That, coupled with Disney's unmatched intellectual property of characters makes Disney a great stock to own as China's economy continues to expand in the decades ahead.  Trouble and opportunity Tim Green (Apple): Apple has been having all sorts of trouble in China lately. Total sales in China dropped 12% year over year during Apple's first quarter despite a rise in global revenue. This disappointing result was actually an improvement: Fourth-quarter sales in China tumbled 30% year over year, and third-quarter sales crashed 33%. Apple's weak performance in China during the past few quarters doesn't mean the company's growth opportunities in the country are dead. Apple faces intense competition in China from local companies as well as Samsung, and its brand doesn't quite have the same power as it has in the U.S. But an innovative product -- perhaps a revamped iPhone 8 later this year -- could reverse its fortunes and force its rivals to scramble to keep up. Image source: Apple. Regaining market share in China won't be easy, and it's possible that competition is just too fierce for the company to both grow sales and maintain its margins in the country. Flagship phones from Chinese companies selling at a fraction of the price Apple charges will be tough to beat. Apple will need to come up with something truly unique to drive sales higher. It certainly has the resources to do it. Filling one of China's largest needs Tyler Crowe (Cheniere Energy): There are countless stories about the size and scale of China's thirst for commodities. Ever since China switched gears to a more market-driven economy, demand for basic materials and energy has grown by a staggering amount. Recently, though, we have seen a shift in the types of commodities China wants, and those shifting trade winds are opening up new opportunities, namely in liquefied natural gas (LNG). One thing that China has been working on rather remarkably in recent years is reducing pollution in its cities. The biggest culprit for air pollution has been burning coal for power, making steel, and other industrial practices. So the country has been shifting away from coal. In fact, in January China announced it was canceling prior plans to install 120 gigawatts of coal-fired power plants -- that's equivalent to 10% of the U.S.' total generation capacity. With incomes growing and urbanization still happening at a rapid rate, China is going to need to fill those energy demands, and LNG is going to be one of the major power sources to fill that gap. We're already seeing this happen. In 2016, total imports of LNG into China increased 32.8% to 26.06 million metric tons, and that is expected to grow to more than 105 million metric tons per year by 2030. There are few companies out there better positioned to take advantage of this coming LNG boom than U.S.-based Cheniere Energy. As the U.S.' first LNG exporter, the company already sent 10% of its 2016 cargoes to China, and that was only from two of the possibly 11 liquefaction trains that Cheniere has on the docket to develop over the next half decade. Some might argue that Cheniere will struggle to deliver to the Asian market because of its locations in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Transporting LNG via ship is expensive and there are a lot of LNG export terminals coming online in the Pacific Rim. That has yet to be an issue, as the company's access to cheap domestic gas offsets these costs. In fact, 28% of its 2016 sales were to the Asia Pacific region, so that higher transportation cost hasn't really become an issue for the company yet.  China's policies can shift on a dime from time to time, but betting on LNG and Cheniere Energy is a smart move as the country cleans up its energy act.

Samsung is the top smartphone seller again! by Aleks • Sat, 11 Mar 2017 10:16 am EDT Sat, 11 Mar 2017 10:16 am EDT in Mobile For several years now, Samsung has been the No.1 seller of smartphone units in the world. And while the Korean company had to recall the Note 7 in 2016, Samsung still made the top of the list. However, despite selling the most phones, Samsung did not make the most profit. Numbers breakdown According to Strategy Analytics, Samsung sold 308.5 million units last year, which is more than 100 million more than Apple. The Cupertino-based company came in second with 215.5 million sold iPhones. We have to note that Samsung has several different models, while Apple has just the iPhone. Samsung has mid-tier, and budget phones in addition to the flagship phone. ADVERTISEMENT Looking at the profit, Apple made close to 80% of the worldwide profits from smartphones. Almost $45 billion, out of $53.7 billion ended up in Apple’s pockets. Samsung, on the other hand, brought just $8.3 billion or 14.6% of profits. Now, a lot of that has to do with the recall of the Note 7. But there is also this thing that Apple puts high price tags on their phones. According to stats, Apple makes $208 profit per phone. Experts believe one of the reasons is Apple uses out-of-date technology at a very low cost, while Samsung brings new technologies at a high cost. Therefore, Samsung is making only $27 profit per phone. Chinese companies round up the top 5. Huawei is on No.3 with 72.2 million units sold, while Xiaomi sold 46.4 million units. Vivo sold 33.7 million of the X series, and 25.6 million of the Y series. Chinese companies target only the China market, where smartphone sells for between $200 and $500. That is a lot lower price than what Apple sells their iPhones for. Can Samsung replicate the success? If Samsung nails its flagship phones in 2017, there is no denying that the company will again be the top smartphone seller. Samsung will launch more than 12 million Galaxy S8 units initially. The company hopes to sell more than 60 million S8 devices by the end of the year. That is in line with what the company did with the S7. When the S7 was launched, Samsung sold more than 13 million units in the first two months. And unlike last year, this year, Samsung plans to make the Note 8 a success. Last year, profits and sales were largely impacted by the recall of the Note 7. The Hype is real The hype for Samsung is real. And the company will surely do great in 2017. Weeks after the release of the “this is a phone” ad, Samsung still has the one of the most viral ads. Last week, the video got more than 26 million impressions, which is astonishing.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement How worried should you be about CIA hacking tools revealed by WikiLeaks? 03/08/2017 at 11:19 AM by Brad Linder 20 Comments Yesterday WikiLeaks released the first part of its “Vault 7” archive with thousands of pages and files that allegedly reveal some of the tools the US Central Intelligence Agency uses to hack phones, computers, and even TVs. Security experts, privacy advocates, and some of the companies whose products are affected are starting to weigh in. So how worried should you be that the CIA can hack your stuff? I’m going to go with “moderately.” Look, you probably already knew that the CIA, NSA, and other spy agencies had tools for hacking into computers and phones of suspected terrorists. My bigger concern is what these documents tell us about the security and privacy of those who either aren’t targets of investigations at all, or who may be under investigation for erroneous reasons. The CIA is stockpiling security vulnerabilities and sometimes even paying for them. Since the agency is not disclosing these security flaws to companies like Google, Apple, Samsung, or Microsoft, it means that users are not only subject to CIA hacking, but hacking from anyone else who is aware of those vulnerabilities. So in the interest of national security, the CIA (and probably other government agencies) are ensuring that your devices are less secure than they could be. So what does that mean? Using Android? Many of the CIA hacking tools discussed in the leak involves smartphones, and many of those are focused on Android, which makes sense. It’s the world’s most used smartphone operating system, and phones are tiny GPS tracking devices that we carry everywhere we go. They’re also listening devices that keep a record of our communications, web browsing, and more. The good news for Android users worried about privacy is that many of the vulnerabilities mentioned seem to address older versions of Android. The less good is that this doesn’t necessarily mean the CIA can’t hack newer versions of the operating system: Vault 7 might just contain out-of-date information and lack details about newer tools the CIA is using. Update: Google says many of the exploits revealed by Vault 7 have already been fixed. Verdict: If you’ve got a phone running newer version of Android, it’s probably safer from some forms of attack than one stuck on Android 4.0. But it’s not really clear at this point how much safer.  Have an iPhone? Most of the things I said above apply to iOS. But Apple has taken the step of releasing a statement saying that the company’s “initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked… were already patched in the latest iOS.” Again, while that means that some of the information in Vault 7 is out of date, we don’t know what we don’t know about newer tools used by the CIA yet. Since the Vault 7 documents also lack actual code, it could be difficult for companies like Apple and Google to use the leaked data to try to identify and patch security vulnerabilities, although both companies will undoubtedly be doing their best to do so. Verdict: See above… but since Apple has a much better mechanism for pushing software updates to users than Google, the vast majority of iPhone and iPad users are running the latest version.  Using WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, or other “secure” communication apps? While some initial headlines made it sound like the CIA has cracked the encryption used by these apps, that’s not exactly true. The encryption still works to keep your messages private. But if your phone is hacked, then the CIA can bypass the encryption in order to monitor your communications. The distinction might sound academic: the apps are safe, but only if you’re phone isn’t already compromised. But this means that efforts to tighten security need to focus on the operating systems, not the apps or Signal communication protocol. Verdict: If you want to use a private messaging app, go ahead and keep using one featuring the Signal protocol. It might not protect you if you (or the person you’re communicating with) has a compromised device. But it’s safer than not using encrypted communications. Have a Samsung Smart TV? Some models are subject to the “Weeping Angel” exploit, which allows the CIA to turn on the mic on a TV and use it as a listening device, even when the TV display is turned off. Sounds scary, and it kind of is. But it’s also limited in scope. If you don’t have a TV with a mic (for voice commands), then you’re probably not affected. And more importantly, this isn’t a remote exploit, which means it can’t be delivered over the internet. Someone actually needs physical access to your TV to install the software. Verdict: Personally I’m a fan of buying a dumb TV and connecting it to the third-party “smart TV” box of your choice anyway. But if you’re paranoid, you can just focus on buying a TV with no mic… or unplug your TV when you’re not using it.  What about Windows, Mac, and Linux computers? There’s much less talk of the CIA’s techniques for hacking desktop operating systems, but there are a few mentions of vulnerabilities that can bypass antivirus software on Windows or attack the BIOS on Macs. The good news is that there may be just enough information to allow antivirus software companies to start detecting (at least some) CIA intrusion. Verdict:¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I mean, you could do the usual things and keep your antivirus software up do date, practice safe browsing, and maybe put tape or another shield over your camera when it’s not in use. But we don’t actually know very much about these particular vulnerabilities.  Conclusion It looks like WikiLeaks may have overhyped the contents of the Vault 7 release, but the biggest revelation might not be about the specific hacking tools at the spy agency’s disposal (or the level of classification on the leaked documents). It might be that the agency is more interested in stockpiling vulnerabilities for its own use than in disclosing them so that they can be patched. And as the EFF notes, that puts citizens at risk rather than protecting them.   Of course, it’s not particularly surprising to know that this has been going on. But it’ll be interesting to see if there’s any call to change course now that the information is public… or if the government will instead focus on hunting down the leakers rather than dealing with the contents of the leaks.   Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 20 Comments on "How worried should you be about CIA hacking tools revealed by WikiLeaks?"

Spying agencies.. you know.. spy. Things containing data.. you know.. allow data retrieval. Things with microphones.. you know.. listen. Companies operating in a country, under that country’s laws, and having to co-operate with law enforcement, have to.. you know.. co-operate. With closed source hardware, proprietary protocols, closed software, how do you know the device is [only] doing what it says on the box? And open source is only built by humans, who make mistakes. The most secure computer is the one that is unplugged and switched off. What I’m more worried about is gangsters doing this, or perhaps other governments, and sometimes as part of corporate espionage.

There was a time when I didn’t care too much for what the CIA and NSA was or wasn’t spying on, even if it was me because I believed it was in the best interest of this great nation. For the most part, I figure what they do they do to protect the country and it’s law abiding citizens. Their targets aren’t you know, the Phillips down the road who live a typical life, Dad the programmer, Mom the insurance agent and little Tommy and Tulip. Now however, everytime I hear news like this I get a little worried.

Fortunately for a president to do something so blatantly unconstitutional as bypass all the legal and legislative controls requires the cooperation of a very large number of people without any whistleblowers finding out, and as worrying as some of his ultra-nationalist advisors are, I don’t think we’re close to being there yet. Clearly, though, if you’re digging into this stuff, either from a political or security angle, it would certainly pay to take precautions, but I would say the same thing to any investigative journalist who is attempting to shine light in the darker regions of political and corporate America. But, after hackers who are just looking to steal your stuff, the biggest danger to most Americans isn’t the NSA or rogue FBI agents, it’s actually… Read more » Vote Up2Vote Down  Reply 8 days 2 hours ago Guest Relentless Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

There was a time when the government issued a warning not to use Internet Explorer (it happened a couple of times, if I recall), for example. Nowadays, it’s about purposely and with malice aforethought withholding this information from the American public. This philosophical shift borders on a kind of treason. We pay our government to protect us. If this behavior came from an outside malicious source, it’s perfectly understandable. We’re dealing an enemy. I’m still waiting for bans on the massive number of IoT products with known backdoors, waiting for legislation limiting the kinds of spyware built into our Operating Systems by companies with ZERO accountability, waiting for sanctions of 3rd-parties tracking users across the internet. There has been nothing from our government related to none of this either.

There will always be some bad actors, but much of the bad behavior stems from making bad decision in spite of good intentions. The security agencies are tasked with keeping Americans safe, and sometimes, they believe they can do their job more effectively by taking short cuts and bypassing all the legal red tape put in place to prevent bad behavior. It’s a serious problem, sure, but your paranoid talk of “treason” and “weaponized” technology does nothing to inform the debate — it just spreads the paranoia, and will likely lead to more bad behavior down the road.

It’s nowhere near as bad as many say, but where do you draw the line? I imagine if you were one of the many significant others spied upon by NSA techs with too much access, you might say it’s far past the point for stricter control and scrutiny.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. It’s a thorny issue, for sure, and for those relatively few individuals caught in the crosshairs, the consequences can be devastating, particularly since the US criminal justice system is almost impossible to fight without highly paid lawyers (this, I believe, is a far bigger problem than NSA or CIA spying). There should always be strict scrutiny of those who hold such power to devastate, but of course, it’s not easy, especially when the programs are naturally covert. But it is important to maintain perspective. Despite the protestations of the conspiracy theorists, we are still a long way from the terrors of the Soviet surveillance state where even a casual conversation with your neighbor could land you in the Gulag.

Documents purportedly outlining a massive CIA surveillance program suggest that CIA agents must go to great lengths to circumvent encryption they can’t break. In many cases, physical presence is required to carry off these targeted attacks. “We are in a world where if the U.S. government wants to get your data, they can’t hope to break the encryption,” said Nicholas Weaver, who teaches networking and security at the University of California, Berkeley. “They have to resort to targeted attacks, and that is costly, risky and the kind of thing you do only on targets you care about. Seeing the CIA have to do stuff like this should reassure civil libertarians that the situation is better now than it was four years ago.” MORE ENCRYPTION Four years ago is when former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed details of huge and secret U.S. eavesdropping programs. To help thwart spies and snoops, the tech industry began to protectively encrypt email and messaging apps, a process that turns their contents into indecipherable gibberish without the coded “keys” that can unscramble them. The NSA revelations shattered earlier assumptions that internet data was nearly impossible to intercept for meaningful surveillance, said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Washington-based civil-liberties group Center for Democracy & Technology. That was because any given internet message gets split into a multitude of tiny “packets,” each of which traces its own unpredictable route across the network to its destination. The realization that spy agencies had figured out that problem spurred efforts to better shield data as it transits the internet. A few services such as Facebook’s WhatsApp followed the earlier example of Apple’s iMessage and took the extra step of encrypting data in ways even the companies couldn’t unscramble, a method called end-to-end encryption. CHALLENGES FOR AUTHORITIES In the past, spy agencies like the CIA could have hacked servers at WhatsApp or similar services to see what people were saying. End-to-end encryption, though, makes that prohibitively difficult. So the CIA has to resort to tapping individual phones and intercepting data before it is encrypted or after it’s decoded. It’s much like the old days when “they would have broken into a house to plant a microphone,” said Steven Bellovin, a Columbia University professor who has long studied cybersecurity issues. Cindy Cohn, executive director for Electronic Frontier Foundation, a group focused on online privacy, likened the CIA’s approach to “fishing with a line and pole rather than fishing with a driftnet.” Encryption has grown so strong that even the FBI had to seek Apple’s help last year in cracking the locked iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers. Apple resisted what it considered an intrusive request, and the FBI ultimately broke into the phone by turning to an unidentified party for a hacking tool — presumably one similar to those the CIA allegedly had at its disposal. On Wednesday, FBI Director James Comey acknowledged the challenges posed by encryption. He said there should be a balance between privacy and the FBI’s ability to lawfully access information. He also said the FBI needs to recruit talented computer personnel who might otherwise go to work for Apple or Google. Government officials have long wanted to force tech companies to build “back doors” into encrypted devices, so that the companies can help law enforcement descramble messages with a warrant. But security experts warn that doing so would undermine security and privacy for everyone. As Apple CEO Tim Cook pointed out last year , a back door for good guys can also be a back door for bad guys. So far, efforts to pass such a mandate have stalled. STILL A PATCHWORK At the moment, though, end-to-end encrypted services such as iMessage and WhatsApp are still the exception. While encryption is far more widely used than it was in 2013, many messaging companies encode user data in ways that let them read or scan it. Authorities can force these companies to divulge message contents with warrants or other legal orders. With end-to-end encryption, the companies wouldn’t even have the keys to do so. Further expanding the use of end-to-end encryption presents some challenges. That’s partly because encryption will make it more difficult to perform popular tasks such as searching years of emails for mentions of a specific keyword. Google announced in mid-2014 that it was working on end-to-end encryption for email, but the tools have yet to materialize beyond research environments. Instead, Google’s Gmail encrypts messages in transit. But even that isn’t possible unless it’s adopted by the recipient’s mail system as well. And encryption isn’t a panacea, as the WikiLeaks disclosures suggest. According to the purported CIA documents, spies have found ways to exploit holes in phone and computer software to grab messages when they haven’t been encrypted yet. Although Apple, Google and Microsoft say they have fixed many of the vulnerabilities alluded to in the CIA documents, it’s not known how many holes remain open. “There are different levels where attacks take place, said Daniel Castro, vice president with the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. “We may have secured one level (with encryption), but there are other weaknesses out there we should be focused on as well.” Cohn said people should still use encryption, even with these bypass techniques. “It’s better than nothing,” she said. “The answer to the fact that your front door might be cracked open isn’t to open all your windows and walk around naked, too.” ——— Liedtke reported from San Francisco.     Tags: encryption, companies, should, encrypted, there, apple, Other stories from today: Credibility of Congress’ Russia probes still in question Egypt archaeologists discover massive statue in Cairo slum Man pleads guilty in stabbing of French train hero     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   What do you think of electric cars?

The news is causing ripples in international relations and got companies like Google and Apple to patch holes and issue fixes. It's also creating unnecessary panic. Wikileaks' characterization of the documents was alarmist and misleading. The press picked up on the alarmism and spread further misinformation. Many in the public believe that the CIA has some new and hitherto unimaginable ability to hack anything. In reality, the Wikileaks documents reveal what we should have already assumed: The CIA collects knowledge about and tools for hacking things. The Wikileaks/CIA stories simply remind us that anything with a camera, microphone or IP address could theoretically be hacked. The question is, will the CIA hack you? I believe the chances that the CIA (or any other hacker) will watch or listen to you, personally, through your smartphone, PC, TV or IP camera are extremely low. It's probably never going to happen. And if it does, it's unlikely that you'll be affected in any way. Yes, take precautions. Use encrypted communication. Don't click on links emailed from strangers. Cover your laptop camera with tape like Mark Zuckerberg does. But anxiety and action shouldn't be based only on what could happen in theory as much as what's likely to happen in practice -- and how much it will affect you. Some people are afraid of sharks. While the prospect of being eaten by a giant fish is vivid and terrifying, it's also unlikely, old chum. In fact, the drive to the beach is far more dangerous than the swim once you get there. Likewise, avoid getting hacked. But more important, start taking action on the bigger risk: The stuff publicly posted on social sites. Anything you post can and will be used against you Politico reported in December that the U.S. government started asking some foreign visitors to provide Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Instagram, LinkedIn and YouTube accounts, so they can be checked for signs of terrorist connections. It was a pretty gentle request, providing such information is only for those on the visa waiver program, and optional. In recent months, however, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials have begun checking the social media accounts of some U.S. citizens who are also Muslim at the point of entry, rather than as part of the paperwork. These checks on social media could reveal what travelers have posted publicly. But the government wants the private stuff, too. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said in an interview this week that the Trump administration wants travelers from certain countries to provide lists of websites they've visited and their online passwords. He wants U.S. Customs "to get on those websites to see what they're looking at." U.S. Customs is proposing to add all Chinese visitors to the list of people asked to disclose their social media profiles. Current policy is based on the religion or nationality of travelers and is mostly superficial and voluntary. But the trend is clear: The U.S. government is rapidly expanding the invasiveness of social media checks in order to figure out who is trustworthy -- and who is not. Other nations are likely to follow the U.S.'s lead, but would search social media based on their own national criteria. Your business trip to Turkey may involve searches that look for support of Kurdish independence. Your vacation to China may involve searching your social accounts for trade secrets to steal. Your weekend in Cuba may end before it begins if Cuban customs agents find a three-year-old tweet shaming hipsters for wearing Che Guevara T-shirts. Social media scrutiny increasingly affects spheres of life beyond travel. Between 35% and 50% of college admissions officers now check the social media accounts of applicants as part of their selection process. Some insurance companies are reportedly checking social media to find out if customers live risky lifestyles, raising the cost of premiums for those who do. Some are even denying claims based on social posts. A CareerBuilder survey last year found that 60% of employers look at the social media posts of prospective employees before choosing which candidate to hire. That number jumped to more than 75% for IT companies, according to the survey. More than 40% of HR managers routinely check the social media accounts of current employees, and a quarter of them have found something that led to action ranging from reprimands to terminations. In the past year, CEOs have become the target of intense scrutiny of social posts, according to Ken Springer, a former FBI agent and current president of Corporate Resolutions, a company that performs such checks on behalf of clients. The bar for acceptable posts by CEOs is high: The CEO of a company called Taylor Gourmet posted a picture of himself with President Trump, which caused a "social media backlash" against the company, according to a report in Bloomberg BNA. All this checking of social media comes with risks. But today's risks are nothing compared with what's coming. Social media posts reveal more than you think Your social media posts are a theoretical open book into your state of mind, opinions, religion, personality and social connections. One example in the news: Facebook is testing the use of artificial intelligence (A.I.) tools to analyze posts and determine whether people are feeling suicidal. Flagged users are reported to the community operations team for possible intervention. That's an extreme case where a company is rightly public about its analysis of user mindset based on social media posts. But the ability for social posts to detect mood is demonstrated by a site called We Feel, which aggregates the mood of everybody on Twitter to track the global collective mood. The analysis of social posts to find out what kind of person you are, how you think, what you believe and how big a "risk" you are to various organizations is about to become big business. Here's what's going to happen. 'Social media profile' will take on a dark new meaning In the near future, social media and A.I. will enable any organization to rank people based on trustworthiness. A Chinese government program called the Social Credit System, which is currently in "beta," seeks to rank everyone in the country. The Chinese government is compiling data on all citizens based on their legal or criminal records, their financial activity and their activity on social networks. All this data is to be collected, compiled and crunched, resulting in a "social credit score" for each citizen. The score will determine rights, privileges and acceptability in various realms. Though the program is still in its infancy, the government has already banned some 6.7 million people from flying or even taking high-speed trains because they haven't paid their debts on time, according to a report in The Financial Times. The social media aspect of this is especially alarming. For example, posting pro-government posts and comments on social media is expected to raise one's score. Posting anything about Tibet or the Dalai Lama is supposed to lower it. A planning document quoted by The Wall Street Journal summarizes the purpose of the Social Credit System: to "allow the trustworthy to roam everywhere under heaven while making it hard for the discredited to take a single step." Data-driven government control of the population is the Chinese way. The American way is based on freedom, which in this case means corporations may be free to use social media to decide who they trust. Software applications are being developed that can identify any person's social media accounts, download every post they've ever made public, and "profile" those people categorically based on comparative analysis. The ability to use data to categorize people is magnified enormously by the rise in artificial intelligence. To oversimplify the inevitable process: Everything known about you (say, your name, location, age, gender, your family and friends and other information) will be fed into A.I. systems that will scan the social web to find all your profiles. The systems will then copy every post, photo or comment you've ever posted. The A.I. will recognize patterns, interpret the photos and parse the comments. The output of these systems will be a profile or dossier on you, and it will advise users about whether to deny your request for a visa, turn down your loan application, avoid hiring you, reject your insurance claims, rebuff your business partnership proposals and more. In other words, A.I. will use data on social networks to rank people based on how much they can be trusted. The worst part is that this trust-judging process happens invisibly behind the scenes. When you don't get that job or loan, you'll never know why. Yes, the CIA can hack your TV. But it probably won't. The bigger risk is social media. Because anything you post can and will be used against you. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

As envisioned by Samsung, the feature was supposed to make it easier for users to unlock their devices, authenticate banking transactions, and even stow away and subsequently access sensitive data stowed away in a Secure Folder. Don't Miss: Apple filing hints at exciting new iPhone 8 features never before seen on an Apple device But as we all know, the Galaxy Note 7 launch quickly blew up in Samsung’s face amid a barrage of reports involving Note 7 devices catching fire and exploding. Ultimately, Samsung was forced to recall the device, an embarrassing turn of events that may have cost the company billions. In turn, the Note 7 wasn’t really around long enough for anyone to determine if its iris scanning feature was actually useful or nothing more than a gimmick. Not to worry, the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus will reportedly both include iris scanning functionality. As it turns out though, it appears that the feature doesn’t work fast enough to make it something consumers might actually find practical to use. According to a report from phoneArena, Samsung is planning to add facial recognition technology to its S8 lineup to either complement the iris scanner or replace it altogether. Of course, with Apple said to be adding advanced facial recognition to the iPhone 8, Samsung’s move here may be partially rooted in its unwavering desire to beat Apple to the punch. Of course, the last time Samsung tried to do that, it rushed out the Note 7 prematurely in order to take advantage of what it presumed would be a lackluster iPhone 7 refresh cycle — and we all saw how that turned out. All that aside, the utility of an iris scanner remains up for debate. Even assuming that the technology is reliable and quick, holding up a device to your face every time you want to access it seems more like a chore than a feature. To this point, one of the earlier Note 7 reviews from AndroidPit touched on this very point. Every time you want to unlock the screen with the iris, you must 1) turn on the screen; 2) swipe your finger across the display; 3) place the device in front of the eyes. Thus, it takes three steps to begin using the device. If you consider that the number of times a user unlocks the screen per day, according to research conducted by app developer Locket, it’s an average of 110 times. This process, then, is not ideal when the Note 7 also gives you the option to use fingerprint unlock. Using the fingerprint method, even when your screen isn’t ‘awake’, you can simply press your finger upon the home button to unlock the device. Either way, we thankfully won’t have to wait too long to see exactly what type of features Samsung’s S8 lineup will bring to the table. The company is expected to reveal all at its Unpacked 2017 event slated to take place on March 29 in New York City.

Likewise, avoid getting hacked. But more important, start taking action on the bigger risk: The stuff publicly posted on social sites. Anything you post can and will be used against you Politico reported in December that the U.S. government started asking some foreign visitors to provide Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Instagram, LinkedIn and YouTube accounts, so they can be checked for signs of terrorist connections. It was a pretty gentle request, providing such information is only for those on the visa waiver program, and optional. In recent months, however, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials have begun checking the social media accounts of some U.S. citizens who are also Muslim at the point of entry, rather than as part of the paperwork. These checks on social media could reveal what travelers have posted publicly. But the government wants the private stuff, too. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said in an interview this week that the Trump administration wants travelers from certain countries to provide lists of websites they've visited and their online passwords. He wants U.S. Customs "to get on those websites to see what they're looking at." U.S. Customs is proposing to add all Chinese visitors to the list of people asked to disclose their social media profiles. Current policy is based on the religion or nationality of travelers and is mostly superficial and voluntary. But the trend is clear: The U.S. government is rapidly expanding the invasiveness of social media checks in order to figure out who is trustworthy -- and who is not. Other nations are likely to follow the U.S.'s lead, but would search social media based on their own national criteria. Your business trip to Turkey may involve searches that look for support of Kurdish independence. Your vacation to China may involve searching your social accounts for trade secrets to steal. Your weekend in Cuba may end before it begins if Cuban customs agents find a three-year-old tweet shaming hipsters for wearing Che Guevara T-shirts. Social media scrutiny increasingly affects spheres of life beyond travel. Between 35% and 50% of college admissions officers now check the social media accounts of applicants as part of their selection process. Some insurance companies are reportedly checking social media to find out if customers live risky lifestyles, raising the cost of premiums for those who do. Some are even denying claims based on social posts. A CareerBuilder survey last year found that 60% of employers look at the social media posts of prospective employees before choosing which candidate to hire. That number jumped to more than 75% for IT companies, according to the survey. More than 40% of HR managers routinely check the social media accounts of current employees, and a quarter of them have found something that led to action ranging from reprimands to terminations. In the past year, CEOs have become the target of intense scrutiny of social posts, according to Ken Springer, a former FBI agent and current president of Corporate Resolutions, a company that performs such checks on behalf of clients. The bar for acceptable posts by CEOs is high: The CEO of a company called Taylor Gourmet posted a picture of himself with President Trump, which caused a "social media backlash" against the company, according to a report in Bloomberg BNA. All this checking of social media comes with risks. But today's risks are nothing compared with what's coming. Social media posts reveal more than you think Your social media posts are a theoretical open book into your state of mind, opinions, religion, personality and social connections. One example in the news: Facebook is testing the use of artificial intelligence (A.I.) tools to analyze posts and determine whether people are feeling suicidal. Flagged users are reported to the community operations team for possible intervention. That's an extreme case where a company is rightly public about its analysis of user mindset based on social media posts. But the ability for social posts to detect mood is demonstrated by a site called We Feel, which aggregates the mood of everybody on Twitter to track the global collective mood. The analysis of social posts to find out what kind of person you are, how you think, what you believe and how big a "risk" you are to various organizations is about to become big business. Here's what's going to happen. 'Social media profile' will take on a dark new meaning In the near future, social media and A.I. will enable any organization to rank people based on trustworthiness. A Chinese government program called the Social Credit System, which is currently in "beta," seeks to rank everyone in the country. The Chinese government is compiling data on all citizens based on their legal or criminal records, their financial activity and their activity on social networks. All this data is to be collected, compiled and crunched, resulting in a "social credit score" for each citizen. The score will determine rights, privileges and acceptability in various realms. Though the program is still in its infancy, the government has already banned some 6.7 million people from flying or even taking high-speed trains because they haven't paid their debts on time, according to a report in The Financial Times. The social media aspect of this is especially alarming. For example, posting pro-government posts and comments on social media is expected to raise one's score. Posting anything about Tibet or the Dalai Lama is supposed to lower it. A planning document quoted by The Wall Street Journal summarizes the purpose of the Social Credit System: to "allow the trustworthy to roam everywhere under heaven while making it hard for the discredited to take a single step." Data-driven government control of the population is the Chinese way. The American way is based on freedom, which in this case means corporations may be free to use social media to decide who they trust. Software applications are being developed that can identify any person's social media accounts, download every post they've ever made public, and "profile" those people categorically based on comparative analysis. The ability to use data to categorize people is magnified enormously by the rise in artificial intelligence. To oversimplify the inevitable process: Everything known about you (say, your name, location, age, gender, your family and friends and other information) will be fed into A.I. systems that will scan the social web to find all your profiles. The systems will then copy every post, photo or comment you've ever posted. The A.I. will recognize patterns, interpret the photos and parse the comments. The output of these systems will be a profile or dossier on you, and it will advise users about whether to deny your request for a visa, turn down your loan application, avoid hiring you, reject your insurance claims, rebuff your business partnership proposals and more. In other words, A.I. will use data on social networks to rank people based on how much they can be trusted. The worst part is that this trust-judging process happens invisibly behind the scenes. When you don't get that job or loan, you'll never know why. Yes, the CIA can hack your TV. But it probably won't. The bigger risk is social media. Because anything you post can and will be used against you. Join the TechWorld newsletter! Join Error: Please check your email address.

On Wednesday, March 8, 2017, Comey acknowledged the challenges posed by encryption. He said there should be a balance between privacy and the FBI’s ability to lawfully access information.

(Photo by JOSE LUIS MAGANA/AP) NEW YORK — If the tech industry is drawing one lesson from the latest WikiLeaks disclosures, it’s that data-scrambling encryption works, and the industry should use more of it. Documents purportedly outlining a massive CIA surveillance program suggest that CIA agents must go to great lengths to circumvent encryption they can’t break. In many cases, physical presence is required to carry off these targeted attacks. “We are in a world where if the U.S. government wants to get your data, they can’t hope to break the encryption,” said Nicholas Weaver, who teaches networking and security at the University of California, Berkeley. “They have to resort to targeted attacks, and that is costly, risky and the kind of thing you do only on targets you care about. Seeing the CIA have to do stuff like this should reassure civil libertarians that the situation is better now than it was four years ago.” ADVERTISEMENT More encryption Four years ago is when former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed details of huge and secret U.S. eavesdropping programs. To help thwart spies and snoops, the tech industry began to protectively encrypt email and messaging apps, a process that turns their contents into indecipherable gibberish without the coded “keys” that can unscramble them. The NSA revelations shattered earlier assumptions that internet data was nearly impossible to intercept for meaningful surveillance, said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Washington-based civil-liberties group Center for Democracy & Technology. That was because any given internet message gets split into a multitude of tiny “packets,” each of which traces its own unpredictable route across the network to its destination. The realization that spy agencies had figured out that problem spurred efforts to better shield data as it transits the internet. A few services such as Facebook’s WhatsApp followed the earlier example of Apple’s iMessage and took the extra step of encrypting data in ways even the companies couldn’t unscramble, a method called end-to-end encryption. Challenges for authorities In the past, spy agencies like the CIA could have hacked servers at WhatsApp or similar services to see what people were saying. End-to-end encryption, though, makes that prohibitively difficult. So the CIA has to resort to tapping individual phones and intercepting data before it is encrypted or after it’s decoded. It’s much like the old days when “they would have broken into a house to plant a microphone,” said Steven Bellovin, a Columbia University professor who has long studied cybersecurity issues. Cindy Cohn, executive director for Electronic Frontier Foundation, a group focused on online privacy, likened the CIA’s approach to “fishing with a line and pole rather than fishing with a driftnet.” Encryption has grown so strong that even the FBI had to seek Apple’s help last year in cracking the locked iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers. Apple resisted what it considered an intrusive request, and the FBI ultimately broke into the phone by turning to an unidentified party for a hacking tool — presumably one similar to those the CIA allegedly had at its disposal. On Wednesday, FBI Director James Comey acknowledged the challenges posed by encryption. He said there should be a balance between privacy and the FBI’s ability to lawfully access information. He also said the FBI needs to recruit talented computer personnel who might otherwise go to work for Apple or Google. Government officials have long wanted to force tech companies to build “back doors” into encrypted devices, so that the companies can help law enforcement descramble messages with a warrant. But security experts warn that doing so would undermine security and privacy for everyone. As Apple CEO Tim Cook pointed out last year , a back door for good guys can also be a back door for bad guys. So far, efforts to pass such a mandate have stalled. Still a patchwork At the moment, though, end-to-end encrypted services such as iMessage and WhatsApp are still the exception. While encryption is far more widely used than it was in 2013, many messaging companies encode user data in ways that let them read or scan it. Authorities can force these companies to divulge message contents with warrants or other legal orders. With end-to-end encryption, the companies wouldn’t even have the keys to do so. Further expanding the use of end-to-end encryption presents some challenges. That’s partly because encryption will make it more difficult to perform popular tasks such as searching years of emails for mentions of a specific keyword. Google announced in mid-2014 that it was working on end-to-end encryption for email, but the tools have yet to materialize beyond research environments. Instead, Google’s Gmail encrypts messages in transit. But even that isn’t possible unless it’s adopted by the recipient’s mail system as well. And encryption isn’t a panacea, as the WikiLeaks disclosures suggest. According to the purported CIA documents, spies have found ways to exploit holes in phone and computer software to grab messages when they haven’t been encrypted yet. Although Apple, Google and Microsoft say they have fixed many of the vulnerabilities alluded to in the CIA documents, it’s not known how many holes remain open. “There are different levels where attacks take place,” said Daniel Castro, vice president with the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. “We may have secured one level (with encryption), but there are other weaknesses out there we should be focused on as well.” Cohn said people should still use encryption, even with these bypass techniques. “It’s better than nothing,” she said. “The answer to the fact that your front door might be cracked open isn’t to open all your windows and walk around naked, too.” –Anick Jesdanun and Michael Liedtke * * * Liedtke reported from San Francisco. play_circle_filled Nintendo Switch console goes on sale in strategy reboot March 05, 2017 play_circle_filled New wave of robots set to deliver the goods February 05, 2017 play_circle_filled Nintendo reboots with new Switch game console January 15, 2017 play_circle_filled Avatar-style South Korean manned robot takes first baby steps January 04, 2017 TAGS: CIA hacking, CIA surveillance, Edward Snowden, encryption, WikiLeaks For feedback, complaints, or inquiries, contact us.

Anniversary iPhone Said to Feature Flat Display, Despite “Curved” Screen Rumors GO The display will be “analogous to current 2.5D glass design” Mar 11, 2017 12:02 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Apple is expected to announce three new iPhones this year, including a revolutionary iPhone Edition or iPhone 8, which will see a complete redesign and the introduction of new features. Rumors on the upcoming phone continue to surface, the most recent ones suggesting a flat display. IHS SMarkit analyst Wayne Lam revealed for MacRumors that Apple “will adopt a flat implementation of OLED design on their special iPhone model, which is analogous to the current 2.5D glass design.” The analyst researches the supply chain of smartphone makers such as Apple. “Much like the recently announced LG G6, we anticipate a touchscreen with a new longer aspect ratio design to take advantage of higher coverage area of the iPhone in its entirety. This new design language is expected to become the trend for 2017, as we all anticipate Samsung's reveal later this month,” he added. 2.5D cover glass and wireless charging The G6 features a 5.7-inch LCD display with 2:1 aspect ratio, which means that the screen’s length is double the size of its width. The aspect ratio on iPhones is 16:9, and it seems that more and more companies are equipping their flagships with smaller bezels. Such is the case of the upcoming Galaxy S8, which will ditch the physical home screen for smaller top and bottom bezels, and thus offer more screen space. iPhone Edition concept showing small bezels The analyst is backed up by recent predictions from KGI Securities and TrendForce, which say that the anniversary iPhone will have a 2.5D cover glass. Such displays are slightly curved at the edges, similar to smartphones like the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus. Some reports have said that the display will be curved, but there’s the possibility that this assumption was made based on the OLED display’s flexible properties. Nevertheless, Apple is said to be testing several prototypes of the upcoming iPhone Edition or iPhone 8. The phone is expected to come with wireless charging, premium materials and a dual-camera setup on the back, among other features.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Apple#iPhone 8#iPhone Edition#2.5D glass#Flat display subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple iPhone Edition Concept Reveals Edge-to-Edge Display Apple Reveals How Siri Learns New Languages to Take On Other Voice Assistants Future iPhones to Support 4K Graphics and Advanced AR/VR with PowerVR Graphics Apple Is Top Smartphone Maker in the US, Samsung Falls Second Samsung Galaxy S8 Features Camera and Iris Scanner Improvements LibreOffice 5.3 Office Suite Gets First Point Release with 100 Improvements Study: 96% of Websites Get Attacked by Bad Bots Windows 10 Creators Update Hides a Secret Ad Switch, Privacy Group Warns YouTube Discontinues Annoying Annotations LXLE 16.04.2 GNU/Linux Distro to Bring All the Goodies from Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS Netflix Turns to Thumbs Up/Down Ratings, Ditches 5-Stars System Intel Launches Bug Bounty Program, Offers Rewards of Up to $30,000 2 photos    iPhone Edition (iPhone 8) concept new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Apple’s 64-bit Only iOS 11 Could Make 187,000 Apps Obsolete more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

By: Tech Desk | Updated: March 11, 2017 5:49 pm The 10th anniversary edition will be called the “iPhone Edition” instead of the iPhone 8. The next-generation iPhone is yet to arrive, but that hasn’t stopped the rumour mill from speculating about it. A new report from Japanese blog Macotakara sheds light on this year’s iPhone. The latest claims are that the 10th anniversary edition will be called the “iPhone Edition” instead of the iPhone 8. The latest report states that Apple is currently testing several prototype models of its flagship iPhone, which is expected to announce in September. Apparently, some models are without the home button and there are others that have different designs based on glass, aluminum or white ceramic. Watch all our videos from Express Technology Those prototype models feature different screen technologies, including LCD and AMOLED. However, the company is to finalize the final model. It’s being speculated that Apple is said to be taking more time to “procure materials” needed to make final design decisions, which is why the report speculated that the iPhone Edition will be released later this year. Also read: Apple iPhone 8 to launch in 64GB, 256GB storage variants: Report However, the report also noted that Apple has already decided on a few features, which includes a 5-inch display, dual-cameras, and wireless charging. Macotakara has also said that the iPhone Edition will be announced in September, alongside the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. The iPhone Edition, however, will be shipped much later than the other two smartphones. Also read: Apple iPhone 8 to include facial recognition, wireless charging: Report According to several reports, Apple will release three iPhones this year. Two of them, the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, will get minor updates over their predecessors. The third model, the iPhone Edition or iPhone 8, could have a curved 5.8-inch OLED display and eliminate the physical home button. Evidently, the “Edition” model won’t come cheap. Last month, it was reported by Fast Company that the iPhone 8 will cost upwards of $1000 (or approx Rs 67,000)  – making it the most expensive iPhone ever.

Instead, the Cupertino giant could still be sticking with flat screens for its new iPhones, especially for the rumored 10th anniversary iPhone or the iPhone 8. On Friday, MacRumors exclusively spoke with smartphone supply chain researcher and analyst Wayne Lam of IHS Markit about Apple’s upcoming iPhones for 2017. Based on Lam’s statement, there wouldn’t be a new iPhone with curved display as claimed by earlier reports. “We anticipate Apple will adopt a flat implementation of OLED design on their special iPhone model, which is analogous to the current 2.5D glass design,” he said.  Previously, rumors were running amok saying Apple is preparing a special iPhone with a curved 5.8-inch edge-to-edge OLED display. This special model is said to be the tech giant’s handset to commemorate the 10th anniversary of its famous smartphone series. What Lam is saying obviously contradicts the assumption that the iPhone 8 would come with curved display just like what Samsung is doing with its flagship Galaxy phones.  Lam instead said that consumers can expect a device that’s much like LG’s G6 flagship phone. ”Much like the recently announced LG G6, we anticipate a touchscreen with a new longer aspect ratio design to take advantage of higher coverage area of the iPhone in its entirety. This new design language is expected to become the trend for 2017, as we all anticipate Samsung's reveal later this month,” Lam explained. It can be noted that when LG unveiled its G5 successor, it stated that curved displays give an uncomfortable grip and build up more tension in the muscles of the hands, as first reported by Tech Times. Perhaps, Apple is also seeing these as the disadvantages of using a curved panel for its 10th anniversary iPhone. Nevertheless, if the Cupertino giant is indeed taking cues from LG, then fans would be happy to see a major redesign in the iPhone series. After all, the G6 comes with a striking appearance thanks to its unique screen-to-body ratio.  Lam said that having a large screen on a small body will be very beneficial to Apple. The company could expand certain features and functions of its iPhone due to the longer aspect ratio. On a final note, the analyst shared that it’s very likely for the next-generation iPhones to have Touch ID or the fingerprint scanner embedded into their display panels.          LATEST STORIES (6) Iraq: Mass Grave of 24 Victims Found, Most of Them Children Iraqi Forces Tracking down ISIL Leader Al-Baghdadi Iraq's MoD Releases Footage of Air Strikes on ISIL Targets in Mosul East Aleppo's Al-Khafasah Main Water Facility Resumes Pumping Water to City More Iraqis Leave Their Homes in Western Mosul, as Battle Continues Yemeni Women Keep Sit-In Protest outside Sanaa UN Office against Saudi War Imperial Economics: Western Companies Support Israeli Apartheid in Palestine – This Has to Stop 7 Al-Nusra Command Posts Smashed in Dara'a Aleppo: Army Launches Massive Operations to Retake Deir Hafer Syrian Army Seizes Terrorists' Arms Cargo in Sweida 2 Spies Arrested in Southern Iran Iran Condemns Terrorist Blasts in Damascus Over 150 Russian Troops Deployed in Syria for Demining Palmyra ISIL Oil Tankers in Deir Ezzur Blown Up by Army, Air Force Syrian Army Advances in Badiyeh Al-Sharqi of Palmyra Iraq: Mass Grave of 24 Victims Found, Most of Them Children TEHRAN (FNA)- Harrowing photos show a battle-hardened Iraqi soldier was brought to tears after uncovering the remains of a little girl murdered by ISIL that was found in a mass grave of some 24 victims - most of them children - in Mosul, Northern Iraq.

Our 2017 Ratings By Avram Piltch, LAPTOP Online Editorial Director | March 9, 2017 03:00 am MORE Not every company offers first-class tech support for its laptops. With confusing web resources, unhelpful social media accounts and clueless phone reps, many brands put a lot of unnecessary obstacles between consumers and the help they need. That's why, for over 10 years, Laptop Mag has published its annual Tech Support Showdown, in which we go undercover to test and grade the most popular laptop brands. Company Name Overall (100) Web Score (60) Phone Score (40) Avg Call Time Phone Number Phone Hours (ET) Web Support Apple 93 56 37 6:00 800-694-7466 24/7 Link Acer 88 50 38 8:36 866-695-2237 24/7 Link Lenovo 86 50 36 11:57 877-453-6686 24/7 Link Microsoft 82 48 34 21:20 800-936-3500 24/7 Link HP 80 45 35 27:00 888-698-3762 8a-12a (M-F) 9a-9p (wkd) Link Dell 76 46 30 13:36 800-624-9897 24/7 Link Razer 74 44 30 7:32 888-697-2037 12p-8p Link Asus 72 40 32 12:00 888-678-3688 24/7 Link Samsung 67 40 27 11:00 800-726-7864 8a-12a (M-F) 9a-11p (wkd) Link MSI 63 35 28 5:25 888-447-6564 8a-10p Link   The Winners After we spent several weeks evaluating 10 laptop makers based on their online support and live chat, social networking resources, and phone-based help, we found that Apple earns top marks once again for its extremely knowledgeable support staff and strong web resources. In a huge improvement over prior years, Acer leaps into second place by providing quick, helpful phone calls and highly accurate online info. Lenovo rounds out our top three with its excellent callback service and wealth of web articles.   The Losers Bringing up the rear are Asus, Samsung and MSI. Asus' live chat and website were especially disappointing. Seemingly still shell-shocked from its exploding-phone debacle, Samsung's support line kept mistaking our Notebook 7 spin for a Galaxy Note 7. And MSI's tech-support reps were shockingly unfamiliar with their company's products.   #1. Apple (93/100) Web Support: support.apple.com Phone Number: (800) 694-7466 (24/7) Key Takeaways: Apple offers the best tech support in the business, year after year. The company's website and mobile app are loaded with helpful, step-by-step tutorials and, whether you reach them via phone or live chat, support reps are knowledgeable and friendly. Apple also answered Twitter messages quickly and accurately. Apple Tech Support 2017 Report Card   #2. Acer (88/100) Web Support: acer.com/ac/en/US/content/support Phone Number: (866) 695-2237 (24/7) Key Takeaways: The best Windows vendor for laptop support this year, Acer offers a useful live chat feature and an extremely helpful, easy-to-use website with lots of articles you can use to help yourself. Company reps nailed the answers to our questions on all three phone calls, which averaged less than 9 minutes. Acer Tech Support 2017 Report Card   #3. Lenovo (86/100) Web Support: support.lenovo.com Phone Number: (877) 453-6686 (24/7) Key Takeaways: Lenovo's callback service, in which you register online and a rep calls you back right away, is extremely quick and helpful. The company has a wealth of online resources, but it can be challenging to find the page which solves your problem. Lenovo Tech Support 2017 Report Card   #4. Microsoft (82/100) Web Support: support.microsoft.com Phone Number: (800) 936-3500 (24/7) Key Takeaways: Microsoft's support site has a lot of helpful information, and the live chat and Twitter responses were quite helpful. Phone support was mostly good, but one confused rep changed a whole bunch of unrelated settings on our laptop. Microsoft Tech Support 2017 Report Card   #5. HP (80/100) Web Support: support.hp.com Phone Number: (888-698-3762 (8 am - 12 am Mon-Fri, 9 am - 9 pm weekend) Key Takeaways: HP's website features a bevy of resources, including a very useful live chat. The company also provided speedy answers to our Twitter query, though the HP account initially sent us outdated instructions from 2011. One phone rep tried to sell us antivirus software after answering our query. HP Tech Support 2017 Report Card   #6. Dell (76/100) Web Support: dell.com/support/home Phone Number: (800) 624-9897 (8 am - 12 am ET Mon-Fri, 9 am - 11 pm weekend) Key Takeaways: Dell's site has a rich set of Windows tips, how-tos, FAQs and diagnostics, though the company's automated "interactive support agent" wasn't much help. Two out of three agents didn't even know about the built-in Waves MaxxAudio app that comes on most Dell laptops. Dell Tech Support 2017 Report Card   #7. Razer (74/100) Web Support: razersupport.com/gaming-systems Phone Number: (888) 697-2037 (12 pm - 8 pm ET) Key Takeaways: Razer's website has some useful FAQs, but offers less information than most competitors; it's also sorely missing a forum. Phone calls were fairly quick, but on one call, the rep kept giving us instructions for the wrong laptop. Razer Tech Support 2017 Report Card   #8. Asus (72/100) Web Support: asus.com/us/support Phone Number: (888) 678-3688 (24/7) Key Takeaways: Asus' live-chat and phone-support agents often steered us wrong (example: changing the video drivers to answer our question about disabling passwords after wake from sleep). On one call, we were even exposed to 15 minutes of odd noise before being disconnected. Asus Tech Support 2017 Report Card   #9. Samsung (67/100) Web Support: samsung.com/us/support/computing/windows-laptops Phone Number: (800-726-7864 (8 am - 12 pm ET Mon-Fri, 9 am - 11 pm weekends) Key Takeaways: When we called Samsung's phone line, we kept getting routed to smartphone support, even though we asked for help with our laptop. When we finally reached the right people, two out of three answers were wrong, with reps unable to understand the company's own software. Samsung Tech Support 2017 Report Card   #10. MSI (63/100) Web Support: us.msi.com/support Phone Number: (888) 447-6564 (8 am - 10 pm ET) Key Takeaways: Peppered with broken English, MSI's support form asks for highly technical information, including your current BIOS version, before you can get an answer. Support calls were blissfully short, usually because the reps weren't familiar enough with MSI's products and gave poor answers. MSI Tech Support 2017 Report Card   How We Rate and Test To see how well laptop makers support their products, we went undercover, posing as everyday users, and tried to answer three questions. We used both the online and telephone support systems of the top 10 manufacturers (because it stopped making consumer laptops, Toshiba missed the cut). For each brand, except for Apple, which has its own OS, we asked one common question about how to stop the computer from going to sleep and then requesting a password upon wake-up. All the other questions were customized for the brands and the consumer laptops we chose for testing. We initiated three phone sessions for each brand, asking one question per session. We also used each company's web resources, including articles, forums and live chat, to find answers. We attempted to contact the companies via both Facebook and Twitter. If a company offered a mobile app for support, we tried that also. Each brand received a score out of 100, of which 60 points rate the company's online support — web, social, apps and forums — and the other 40 points score the brand's phone-based support. We gave online support more weight, because it's a more popular way to get help and is most people's first stop.   Tech Support Showdown Scorecard and Winners Acer Apple Asus Dell HP Lenovo Microsoft MSI Razer Samsung Author Bio Avram Piltch, LAPTOP Online Editorial Director The official Geeks Geek, as his weekly column is titled, Avram Piltch has guided the editorial and production of Laptopmag.com since 2007.

Says: March 10th, 2017 at 2:51 pm I noticed you didn't rate Gateway. If you had it would have been at the bottom- if anyone else had the AWFUL experience I had. The make and sell flimsy JUNK that overheats and breaks. They don't honor their three year, onsite business warranties. They don't update their BIOS, drivers, etc. when Microsoft updates break the cooling. They don't warranty batteries, and when they fail during the laptop's warranty period, you will discover that they have none to sell you. You winds up with a $2600 boat anchor. I could go on and on.. rolfe Says: March 10th, 2017 at 6:32 am This is the Best section in LaptogMag. I realized that the best decision in buying electronics is checking Tech support first! Marketing and price are useless if their tech support play misserable on you when you have a problem later. Tech support quality is my first deal breaker when buying a laptop. Thanks! John Ohannessian Says: March 9th, 2017 at 7:49 pm Here is my experience with Lenovo. Very true that they will call you as soon as you hit the online call me back submit button, very impressive. The tech support reps who are in the Philippines are very pleasant, very helpful and right on the money in helping me with my defective but new laptop. They shipped me a box with FedEx return label quickly and after they received my laptop they identified my laptop's hardware issues the same day. I am quite impressed with Lenovo and feel that I am in good hands. omegatalon Says: March 9th, 2017 at 7:45 pm Hewlett Packard is pretty awful especially in that they refused to allow me to send my notebook in for service despite being on an Extended Accidental Warranty; I had to threaten to have my credit card company charge them with fraud before they took the computer for service. Samuel Yuok Says: March 9th, 2017 at 6:00 pm I aggreed about ASUS one of the worst. Their Zen phone should not be in the US market !!! carla Says: March 9th, 2017 at 5:45 pm what happened with TOSHIBA? why is not in the ratings? marcus Says: March 9th, 2017 at 12:04 pm Thank you for this very informative article. I'm currently deciding between the Dell XPS 15 Kaby Lake 4K and the Apple Macbook Pro 15. I have had past Dell support issues, I think consumers named it "Dell Hell" couple years back when calls were routed to non-US support centers. Fortunately I had only 1 incidence of that happening with an ALienware M15x(keyboard issue) around 2009. I agree that Apple does a tremendously excellent job on customer support. The ease of chatting with English speaking customer service reps and ability to take the notebook to an Apple Store is a bonus. This article def helps me lean towards Apple. Amanda Fairchild Says: February 19th, 2017 at 8:29 pm Need laptop only for emails, perusing web and some word processing. Will laptop with 2 GB suffice? Thank you. Wayne Hughes Says: January 3rd, 2017 at 5:34 pm Great Article; The information provided about tech support will definitely help me decide on my next PC. Now if you could just tell us what portion of the tech support was US based that would be great. Joss W. Says: December 3rd, 2016 at 7:22 pm DELL is 7th, but are so bad they shouldn't have made the list! vijaya sunkara Says: October 21st, 2016 at 3:32 am Can you please let me know when a similar tech support review report for 2016 will be available?

Says: August 17th, 2016 at 9:39 pm I've personally dealt with HP, Apple, and Dell...and a few others no longer in the market. I have to say I fully agree that Apple is hands-down the best I've ever dealt with! Pushpendra sharma Says: July 23rd, 2016 at 11:42 am Hi, i want to buy a laptop in range of 20000 to 25000. Please any body can suggest which is best laptop in this price . I am not known about its features plz suggest which company which model will good in this price . Only my normal personal use. Jim Beaman Says: January 6th, 2016 at 7:44 pm I ordered & received a Dell lap top for my wife for Christmas. The box came sealed, so I figured everything was ok. When she opened the box Christmas morning There was no power cord supplied with the lap top! What do you do about that? HeyBuddy UpYours Says: January 4th, 2016 at 8:11 pm Why is it that MSI has a 5 minute phone wait time ranked 10th, yet other companies have much longer waits, such as Dell ranked 7th at 40 minutes, Lenogo ranked 5th at 27 minutes, & HP ranked 4th at 33:18. Is our time valued so little that we must dig through forums & websites in hopes to figure out what's wrong with our computer, assuming it even works when we need it? LaptopMag, you need to get your priorities in order. kevon Says: November 13th, 2015 at 11:02 pm I don't think this website is a creditable source for reviews and guiding customers in purchasing a laptop that is durable and supportive. I have read the review and it is bias these reviews seem to dislike some manufacture.

If the tech industry is drawing one lesson from the latest WikiLeaks disclosures, it’s that data-scrambling encryption works, and the industry should use more of it. In the past, spy agencies like the CIA could have simply tapped servers at WhatsApp or similar services to see what people were saying. Associated Press Saturday, March 11, 2017 | 12:05 a.m. NEW YORK — If the tech industry is drawing one lesson from the latest WikiLeaks disclosures, it's that data-scrambling encryption works, and the industry should use more of it. Documents purportedly outlining a massive CIA surveillance program suggest that CIA agents must go to great lengths to circumvent encryption they can't break. In many cases, physical presence is required to carry off these targeted attacks. "We are in a world where if the U.S. government wants to get your data, they can't hope to break the encryption," said Nicholas Weaver, who teaches networking and security at the University of California, Berkeley. "They have to resort to targeted attacks, and that is costly, risky and the kind of thing you do only on targets you care about. Seeing the CIA have to do stuff like this should reassure civil libertarians that the situation is better now than it was four years ago." MORE ENCRYPTION Four years ago is when former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed details of huge and secret U.S. eavesdropping programs. To help thwart spies and snoops, the tech industry began to protectively encrypt email and messaging apps, a process that turns their contents into indecipherable gibberish without the coded "keys" that can unscramble them. The NSA revelations shattered earlier assumptions that internet data was nearly impossible to intercept for meaningful surveillance, said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Washington-based civil-liberties group Center for Democracy & Technology. That was because any given internet message gets split into a multitude of tiny "packets," each of which traces its own unpredictable route across the network to its destination. The realization that spy agencies had figured out that problem spurred efforts to better shield data as it transits the internet. A few services such as Facebook's WhatsApp followed the earlier example of Apple's iMessage and took the extra step of encrypting data in ways even the companies couldn't unscramble, a method called end-to-end encryption. CHALLENGES FOR AUTHORITIES In the past, spy agencies like the CIA could have hacked servers at WhatsApp or similar services to see what people were saying. End-to-end encryption, though, makes that prohibitively difficult. So the CIA has to resort to tapping individual phones and intercepting data before it is encrypted or after it's decoded. It's much like the old days when "they would have broken into a house to plant a microphone," said Steven Bellovin, a Columbia University professor who has long studied cybersecurity issues. Cindy Cohn, executive director for Electronic Frontier Foundation, a group focused on online privacy, likened the CIA's approach to "fishing with a line and pole rather than fishing with a driftnet." Encryption has grown so strong that even the FBI had to seek Apple's help last year in cracking the locked iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers. Apple resisted what it considered an intrusive request, and the FBI ultimately broke into the phone by turning to an unidentified party for a hacking tool — presumably one similar to those the CIA allegedly had at its disposal. On Wednesday, FBI Director James Comey acknowledged the challenges posed by encryption. He said there should be a balance between privacy and the FBI's ability to lawfully access information. He also said the FBI needs to recruit talented computer personnel who might otherwise go to work for Apple or Google. Government officials have long wanted to force tech companies to build "back doors" into encrypted devices, so that the companies can help law enforcement descramble messages with a warrant. But security experts warn that doing so would undermine security and privacy for everyone. As Apple CEO Tim Cook pointed out last year , a back door for good guys can also be a back door for bad guys. So far, efforts to pass such a mandate have stalled. STILL A PATCHWORK At the moment, though, end-to-end encrypted services such as iMessage and WhatsApp are still the exception. While encryption is far more widely used than it was in 2013, many messaging companies encode user data in ways that let them read or scan it. Authorities can force these companies to divulge message contents with warrants or other legal orders. With end-to-end encryption, the companies wouldn't even have the keys to do so. Further expanding the use of end-to-end encryption presents some challenges. That's partly because encryption will make it more difficult to perform popular tasks such as searching years of emails for mentions of a specific keyword. Google announced in mid-2014 that it was working on end-to-end encryption for email, but the tools have yet to materialize beyond research environments. Instead, Google's Gmail encrypts messages in transit. But even that isn't possible unless it's adopted by the recipient's mail system as well. And encryption isn't a panacea, as the WikiLeaks disclosures suggest. According to the purported CIA documents, spies have found ways to exploit holes in phone and computer software to grab messages when they haven't been encrypted yet. Although Apple, Google and Microsoft say they have fixed many of the vulnerabilities alluded to in the CIA documents, it's not known how many holes remain open. "There are different levels where attacks take place, said Daniel Castro, vice president with the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. "We may have secured one level (with encryption), but there are other weaknesses out there we should be focused on as well." Cohn said people should still use encryption, even with these bypass techniques. "It's better than nothing," she said. "The answer to the fact that your front door might be cracked open isn't to open all your windows and walk around naked, too."

Rivals or friends: What’s brewing between Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai? Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai were seen dining together in Palo Alto this week. By: Tech Desk | Updated: March 11, 2017 3:56 pm Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai were seen dining together in Palo Alto this week. (Image credit: Steve Sims/Instagram) To anyone who says rivals can’t be buddies, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai are here to prove you wrong. The leaders of the two most valuable tech companies by market capitalisation were spotted having dinner earlier this week at Tamarine restaurant in Palo Alto. Cook and Pichai were spotted by several people at the same restaurant, who snapped up pictures of the two having dinner together. One eyewitness, Amit Pradhan, was at the restaurant with friends. He saw the two having a one-on-one conversation and soon shared the photos on his Facebook account. Steve Sims, founder of a luxury concierge service, was hosting a dinner when he spotted the two high-profile executives at the upscale restaurant. Sims took to Instagram to show his excitement. Everyone is trying to figure out what exactly the two tall leaders might have discussed. Going by the photos, the two seems to have a relaxed conversation. What do you think the two executives discussed ? Perhaps they had a long conversation about the future of self-driving cars. Or maybe they exchanged tips to crack the Indian smartphone market. This isn’t the first time the heads of Apple and Google have been spotted together. Back in the day, Steve Jobs and then Google CEO Eric Schmidt were seen at a coffee shop during a fallout. It’s fair to acknowledge that both Apple and Google are one another’s biggest competitors. But again, who says rivals can’t have a dinner together.

Shop: Surface Studio | New Surface Book | Xbox One S Bundles | NEW Dell XPS 13" Windows > Mac Switching from Mac to a Windows PC: 10 tips to ease your tech transition By Al Sacco Thursday, Mar 9, 2017 at 12:00 pm EST 19 Comments Thanks to an impressive array of quality PC hardware options, and some less-than-inspiring product launches and updates from Apple, now is a great time to make the switch from Mac to Windows. Microsoft versus Apple. PC versus Mac. Windows versus OS X, errr, macOS. Surface Pro versus iPad. Zune versus iPod. (OK, that last one might be a bit off ... but you get the point.) It's a technology battle that's been waging for decades, with constant ebbs and flows based on the market and user priorities. During the past few years, the momentum started to once again shift back toward Microsoft and the Windows PC. That has a lot to do with some uninspired updates from Apple (we're looking at you, new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar) and lackluster product launches (iPad Pro, anybody?), as well as some solid hardware options from Microsoft partners, including Dell and HP. (We're particularly smitten with the XPS 15 and HP Spectre x360 15.) In other words, Windows is cool again. Whatever your reason for taking the PC plunge and switching from a Mac computer to Windows, the transition isn't always an easy one. You likely have your work cut out for you — at least at first. At Windows Central, we love our PCs, and we're sure you'll ultimately be thrilled with the decision to ditch that Mac and move to the wonderful world of Windows. But you can ease the transition with just a little preparation. These 10 tips are a great place to start. Switching from Mac to Windows 1. Embrace your Microsoft account First things first, you're going to need to create a Microsoft account. A Microsoft account is required to log in to your PC, and it will help you personalize your device, not unlike how Apple ID works on Mac — but you don't need to save a credit card, as you do with an Apple ID. If you already setup your PC, you probably already created an account. But did you know your Microsoft account gives you access to a bunch of additional Microsoft services, including Skype, OneDrive, Xbox Live, the Windows Store and MSN services? If you already use any of these Microsoft services, or have in the past, you likely already have a Microsoft account. For example, if you use Skype, you can use your Skype credentials to log in to your Microsoft account. It's a good idea to spend some time poking around these services to determine which ones are valuable to you. They're free, after all. 2. Go cold turkey and quit that Mac completely This tip is easier said than done, but it's also perhaps the most important advice on this list. Chances are you still have your old Mac, and when you come across some "challenge" with your new PC, you might be tempted to try to circumvent it and just pop back onto the old Apple computer to get the job done. That's a terrible idea. The quicker you resolve any issues, or figure out how to get past some sticking point on PC that's different than on a Mac, the faster you'll get up to speed with Windows. We suggest going completely, 100 percent cold turkey with your new PC ASAP. Hide your Mac under your bed or in a closet if you must. You already made your decision to switch, right? The most effective way to transition from Mac to PC is to dive right in wholeheartedly. Trust us, you'll be glad you did. In the meantime, if you're still trying to figure out which PC you want to get, go ahead and install Windows 10 on your Mac — make that MacBook Pro truly Pro. 3. Ease into the Windows ecosystem Yes, you should go cold turkey and only use your new PC after you first make your switch. However, you should not try to do too much, too soon. That's a recipe for disaster, and Windows and Mac are different enough that if you try to master your new PC in the first 24 hours, you may quickly become overwhelmed. You'll need some apps and services immediately, whether they're for work or play, productivity or entertainment. However, some of the other stuff, the fun-but-not-necessarily-essential software, can wait. Which leads us to our next tip ... 4. Identify essential apps and find replacements if necessary Everybody has a few apps (or more) that they just can't live without. If you're a recovering Mac user, iTunes may still have its hooks in you. Maybe your organization uses Outlook or Slack for communication, and you can't work without one or both of those apps. Perhaps it's your Twitter client of choice. Whatever the app, it's a good idea to be proactive and make a quick list of the software that you absolutely need. As long as you have access to those services, a speedy transition from Mac to Windows will be possible, even if it's at times a little painful. If your essential apps are paid or premium apps, you may need to dig up your software licenses. Most large developers make it fairly simple to log in to their sites and access active license info and software keys. For example, if you're an Adobe Photoshop Creative Cloud subscriber, you may be able to simply log in to your Adobe account and download your apps, depending on your subscription type. Smaller developers usually at least email your licensing information when you purchase an app. So searching for the app names or related keywords in your inbox can also help dig up relevant product keys and other details. Hopefully all of your essential Mac apps are also available for PC, but you're bound to find at least a couple that aren't. We know, it's frustrating to find that an app you depend on isn't available on your new platform. But the Windows 10 ecosystem is packed with awesome apps, and with just a little effort, we're confident you'll find a worthy alternative. Lots of people have switched from Mac to PC in recent years, so if there's a particular app that you're missing, you're probably not the first person to have experienced the problem. A good Google search could quickly turn up suitable alternatives, sometimes at more affordable prices — or even free. For example, if you used to use the Mailplane Gmail app for Mac and were disappointed to find that it's not available for Windows, a Google search for "Windows alternatives to Mailplane Gmail app" turns up comparable options, some free. You may even find a few new favorite apps. 5. Take advantage of Windows' unique strengths Windows PCs offer many things that Macs simply don't, or can't. After you decide to embrace Windows, it would be foolish not take advantage of those strengths. Today's Windows PCs, for example, often offer significantly more bang for your buck than Apple's computer, which are consistently pricey. Dell's awesome XPS 15 starts at more than $550 less than Apple's 15" MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, with comparable specs, for example. Oh, and the XPS 15 has a touch screen ... and, you know, functional ports. (ZING.) The Windows world is all about choice and customization. The Apple world ... isn't. Shopping for a new PC can be much more rewarding than shopping for a Mac, most of which are more or less preconfigured by Apple. And customizing a PC you already purchased is an entirely different experience than making a Mac your own. Today's Windows machines are often easy to repair. Mac computers? Nope. (Apple purposefully makes it frustratingly difficult to repair the new MacBook Pro.) If you're past the shopping stage and already bought a specific PC, you can still take advantage of the ecosystem by upgrading some components or adding some worthy accessories, such as a docking station that's made specifically for your PC. For folks who like to build their own PCs, or even just easily upgrade RAM or replace a worn-down battery, Windows PCs come out on top every time. 6. Resistance to Windows software updates is futile One big difference between Mac and Windows is how PCs handle software updates from Microsoft. By default, Windows 10 automatically installs software updates when they're available. For new Windows converts, this process can be ... annoying. It sometimes takes a while to install updates, so you might have to wait while they install, which is less than ideal. Of course, it's a good idea to make sure your PC is always up to date, to protect yourself against the latest security threats and ensure you have all the newest features. So Windows 10 auto updates aren't all bad. But they do take some getting used to. In general, don't be surprised if Windows decides to install a software update at an inopportune moment. Just embrace it ... and try not to lose your cool. The good news is that if you're using Windows 10 Pro or higher, you can take back some control and prevent the OS from downloading and installing updates automatically: How to stop Windows 10 auto updates 7. Learn to love your Windows keyboard shortcuts Both Windows and macOS are packed with valuable keyboard shortcuts that let you perform a variety of tasks quickly with just a couple of coordinated key strokes. Unfortunately, though similar in some cases, each OS uses different keyboard shortcuts. So even if you know your Mac shortcuts inside and out, you're going to have to learn a whole new set of keyboard shortcuts for Windows. One of the main differences between Windows and Mac keyboard shortcuts is the fact that the many Mac shortcuts use that OS's "Command" key. No such key exists on Windows, and many Windows shortcuts instead are based on some combination of keys and the "Windows" key, which is marked with a Windows logo. (In some cases, the "Ctrl" key on Windows is used in place of macOS's Command button.) It can all be a lot to process at first, but it's worth taking the time to learn those shortcuts. And you're in luck: We recently created a guide to Windows shortcuts that's easy to navigate — and even easier to bookmark for future reference. 8. Get to know your Windows antivirus software — and use it Windows, by virtue of the sheer number of PCs out there, is a target for viruses. As such, you have to proactively protect your PC in a way that's just not necessary on a Mac. That's not to say Macs are bulletproof when it comes to online threats, but protecting a PC is a very different proposition than protecting a Mac. Microsoft includes two native apps in Windows 10 that are designed to help you protect your computer from viruses and malware: Windows Defender and Windows Firewall. For the average user, these apps are probably enough. Windows Defender is enabled by default when you first start using Windows 10. But if you want to turn it on our off, go to Start menu > Settings > Updates & Security > choose Windows Defender and turn Real-time protection on or off. Windows Firewall should also be turned on by default. However, you can turn it on or off by hitting the Start menu > scroll to Windows System > Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Firewall > select Turn Windows Firewall on or off > enter your password if prompted. (Note: It's not a good idea to disable Windows Firewall unless you plan to use another firewall.) Or course, Microsoft's native apps aren't your only options. Many alternative and free options also exist: Best Antivirus Software of 2017 Best Free Antivirus Alternatives to Windows Defender 9. Stop by your local Microsoft Store If you live in a major U.S city or metropolitan area, there is likely a Microsoft retail store near you. (You can find your nearest location using Microsoft's store locator.) Not unlike Apple Stores, Microsoft Stores are brightly-lit, open spaces packed with tech toys and retail reps who are eager to answer your every question. We highly recommend stopping by, talking up the reps, asking any questions you may have, playing an Xbox game or two on their bigass TVs, and just poking around in general. You won't find a huge selection of components or accessories, but all of Microsoft's own latest and greatest hardware will be on display, along with some of the most popular machines from Microsoft's leading hardware partners. Many of the PCs in our definitive 2017 laptop buyer's guide are available in Microsoft stores, for example. So even if you already purchased a new PC, you can go check out and tinker with the other toys. Microsoft stores are a great place to familiarize yourself with the ecosystem. But beware: You might want to leave your credit card at home — it's very easy to drop a bunch of cash on stuff you probably don't need. Even if you want it so hard. 10.

In my experience, Macs tend to obey the sleep timer very strictly, where Windows will allow apps to keep the PC awake. My wife's Windows 10 machine will often not go to sleep on its own because of a random Firefox tab. The display turns off, but the fan keeps hissing. It's not perfect on the other side either, as my Mac mini will go to sleep in the middle of downloads or encoding. You just have to make an adjustment. With a Mac, you have to change the sleep timer, with Windows, you may need to close your browser or manually put the PC to sleep. Personally, I prefer the strict timer approach, but I could see how that might be a nuisance to others.  1 1 week ago Reply Charles Fecht And then there's the constant issue of trying to wake up a Mac.. 1 1 week ago Reply ThreeOnTheTree The devices I've had the most wake trouble with has been Surface 2/3.

The Smart Night Lighter recently completed a successful funding raise on the tech crowd funding site Kickstarter, https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/812459452/smart-night-lighter?ref=nav_search , The SNL is the first charger adapter that eliminates the need for expensive Apple cables for charging your Apple mobile phones, iPads and other lightning devices. An Android version adapter is also available for a wide range of micro USB devices. "We are extremely pleased to be able to debut the Smart Night Lighter at the upcoming Dallas Electronic Retail Summit Trade Show on March 13. An anonymous sponsor helped SNL's Kickstarter site reach its preliminary funding goal in just a few days, so we knew we had a product hit on our hands. After the ringing consumer support, it's now the perfect time to allow retailers to take a look at Smart Night Lighter," said Don Baker, vice president of marketing for Red Peacock INC. "SNL is an economic breakthrough. People won't need to buy product specific charging cables ever again, eliminating the need for expensive Apple cables. Plus dual forward white lighting on the adapter makes it easy to connect your phone charger at night and will keep you from tripping on cords in the dark," added Baker. The Smart Night Lighter features both Android and Apple MFI certified (made for iPhones/iPad) versions. Apple users can now use any Android cable, and the SNL adapter works with over 1900 types of Apple or Android based Smart phones worldwide because of the SNL utility patent that distinguishes it from other charging adapters. The Android version can be used with all USB micro ports such as power banks, digital cameras, handheld GPS, and millions of electronic gadgets with a USB micro charger outlet. Smart Night Lighter Cables are also available that are Android based only, but work with either the Android or Apple adapter version. Smart Cables include more copper wiring for higher charging speed. Cables come in PVC white, or braided nylon black and white in readymade sets of three lengths convenient for home, office, or car use. "The Smart Night Lighter campaign on Kickstarter was so successful that it has been featured by a large number of news outlets, including a prestigious article in Forbes," said Baker. "We are happy that consumers have recognized the product's value. There is so much clutter in the market place but the Smart Night Lighter has shone bright."

By: AP | Published:March 11, 2017 12:58 pm lthough Apple, Google and Microsoft say they have fixed many of the vulnerabilities alluded to in the CIA documents, it’s not known how many holes remain open. (Source: AP) If the tech industry is drawing one lesson from the latest WikiLeaks disclosures, it’s that data-scrambling encryption works, and the industry should use more of it. Documents purportedly outlining a massive CIA surveillance program suggest that CIA agents must go to great lengths to circumvent encryption they can’t break. In many cases, physical presence is required to carry off these targeted attacks. Watch all our videos from Express Technology “We are in a world where if the U.S. government wants to get your data, they can’t hope to break the encryption,” said Nicholas Weaver, who teaches networking and security at the University of California, Berkeley. “They have to resort to targeted attacks, and that is costly, risky and the kind of thing you do only on targets you care about. Seeing the CIA have to do stuff like this should reassure civil libertarians that the situation is better now than it was four years ago.” MORE ENCRYPTION Four years ago is when former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed details of huge and secret U.S. eavesdropping programs. To help thwart spies and snoops, the tech industry began to protectively encrypt email and messaging apps, a process that turns their contents into indecipherable gibberish without the coded “keys” that can unscramble them. The NSA revelations shattered earlier assumptions that internet data was nearly impossible to intercept for meaningful surveillance, said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Washington-based civil-liberties group Center for Democracy & Technology. That was because any given internet message gets split into a multitude of tiny “packets,” each of which traces its own unpredictable route across the network to its destination. In the past, spy agencies like the CIA could have hacked servers at WhatsApp or similar services to see what people were saying. ( Source: AP) The realization that spy agencies had figured out that problem spurred efforts to better shield data as it transits the internet. A few services such as Facebook’s WhatsApp followed the earlier example of Apple’s iMessage and took the extra step of encrypting data in ways even the companies couldn’t unscramble, a method called end-to-end encryption. CHALLENGES FOR AUTHORITIES In the past, spy agencies like the CIA could have hacked servers at WhatsApp or similar services to see what people were saying. End-to-end encryption, though, makes that prohibitively difficult. So the CIA has to resort to tapping individual phones and intercepting data before it is encrypted or after it’s decoded. It’s much like the old days when “they would have broken into a house to plant a microphone,” said Steven Bellovin, a Columbia University professor who has long studied cybersecurity issues. Cindy Cohn, executive director for Electronic Frontier Foundation, a group focused on online privacy, likened the CIA’s approach to “fishing with a line and pole rather than fishing with a driftnet.” Encryption has grown so strong that even the FBI had to seek Apple’s help last year in cracking the locked iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers. Apple resisted what it considered an intrusive request, and the FBI ultimately broke into the phone by turning to an unidentified party for a hacking tool — presumably one similar to those the CIA allegedly had at its disposal. BI Director James Comey acknowledged the challenges posed by encryption. ( Source: AP) On Wednesday, FBI Director James Comey acknowledged the challenges posed by encryption. He said there should be a balance between privacy and the FBI’s ability to lawfully access information. He also said the FBI needs to recruit talented computer personnel who might otherwise go to work for Apple or Google. Government officials have long wanted to force tech companies to build “back doors” into encrypted devices, so that the companies can help law enforcement descramble messages with a warrant. But security experts warn that doing so would undermine security and privacy for everyone. As Apple CEO Tim Cook pointed out last year , a back door for good guys can also be a back door for bad guys. So far, efforts to pass such a mandate have stalled. STILL A PATCHWORK At the moment, though, end-to-end encrypted services such as iMessage and WhatsApp are still the exception. While encryption is far more widely used than it was in 2013, many messaging companies encode user data in ways that let them read or scan it. Authorities can force these companies to divulge message contents with warrants or other legal orders. With end-to-end encryption, the companies wouldn’t even have the keys to do so. Further expanding the use of end-to-end encryption presents some challenges. That’s partly because encryption will make it more difficult to perform popular tasks such as searching years of emails for mentions of a specific keyword. Google announced in mid-2014 that it was working on end-to-end encryption for email, but the tools have yet to materialize beyond research environments. At the moment, though, end-to-end encrypted services such as iMessage and WhatsApp are still the exception. (Source: AP) Instead, Google’s Gmail encrypts messages in transit. But even that isn’t possible unless it’s adopted by the recipient’s mail system as well. And encryption isn’t a panacea, as the WikiLeaks disclosures suggest. According to the purported CIA documents, spies have found ways to exploit holes in phone and computer software to grab messages when they haven’t been encrypted yet. Although Apple, Google and Microsoft say they have fixed many of the vulnerabilities alluded to in the CIA documents, it’s not known how many holes remain open. Also Read: WikiLeaks wants to work with tech companies after CIA data leak “There are different levels where attacks take place, said Daniel Castro, vice president with the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. “We may have secured one level (with encryption), but there are other weaknesses out there we should be focused on as well.” Cohn said people should still use encryption, even with these bypass techniques. “It’s better than nothing,” she said. “The answer to the fact that your front door might be cracked open isn’t to open all your windows and walk around naked, too.” For all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now Tags: CIA WikiLeaks Election 2017 Goa floor test today, Congress hurls casino money charge at BJP Manipur: Biren Singh takes oath, forms first BJP government Punjab: Captain Amarinder Singh takes oath today, H S Phoolka is Opposition leader Best of Express PM Modi asks BJP MPs to push govt schemes, Amit Shah sounds alert for more poll battles EntertainmentBaahubali 2 trailer: SS Rajamouli's Baahubali The Conclusion proves Baahubali was just a starter, watch video EntertainmentTrapped movie review: Rajkummar Rao film fails to take us over the edge EntertainmentShah Rukh Khan's car hits photographer, actor rushes him to hospital.

Contrary to previous reports, a supply chain analyst has claimed that Apple is unlikely to release a next-gen iPhone with curved display. Instead, the Cupertino giant could still be sticking with flat screens for its new iPhones, especially for the rumored 10th anniversary iPhone or the iPhone 8.  On Friday, MacRumors exclusively spoke with smartphone supply chain researcher and analyst Wayne Lam of IHS Markit about Apple’s upcoming iPhones for 2017. Based on Lam’s statement, there wouldn’t be a new iPhone with curved display as claimed by earlier reports. “We anticipate Apple will adopt a flat implementation of OLED design on their special iPhone model, which is analogous to the current 2.5D glass design,” he said.  Previously, rumors were running amok saying Apple is preparing a special iPhone with a curved 5.8-inch edge-to-edge OLED display. This special model is said to be the tech giant’s handset to commemorate the 10th anniversary of its famous smartphone series. What Lam is saying obviously contradicts the assumption that the iPhone 8 would come with curved display just like what Samsung is doing with its flagship Galaxy phones.  Popular Searches Adobe Systems Inc ADBE ▲ 122.35 +0.24 +0.20% Intel Corp INTC ▲ 35.14 +0.04 +0.11% Verizon Communications Inc VZ ▼ 50.04 -0.10 -0.20% CBS Corp CBS.A ▼ 68.63 -0.42 -0.61% Lam instead said that consumers can expect a device that’s much like LG’s G6 flagship phone. ”Much like the recently announced LG G6, we anticipate a touchscreen with a new longer aspect ratio design to take advantage of higher coverage area of the iPhone in its entirety. This new design language is expected to become the trend for 2017, as we all anticipate Samsung's reveal later this month,” Lam explained. It can be noted that when LG unveiled its G5 successor, it stated that curved displays give an uncomfortable grip and build up more tension in the muscles of the hands, as first reported by Tech Times. Perhaps, Apple is also seeing these as the disadvantages of using a curved panel for its 10th anniversary iPhone. Nevertheless, if the Cupertino giant is indeed taking cues from LG, then fans would be happy to see a major redesign in the iPhone series. After all, the G6 comes with a striking appearance thanks to its unique screen-to-body ratio.  Lam said that having a large screen on a small body will be very beneficial to Apple. The company could expand certain features and functions of its iPhone due to the longer aspect ratio. On a final note, the analyst shared that it’s very likely for the next-generation iPhones to have Touch ID or the fingerprint scanner embedded into their display panels.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

X Share Tweet Share Pin It Email Copy link to paste in your message / Digital assistants are becoming ever-more popular. Tai Chi for the over 55s at the Pavilion 1 Hair cut for Little Princess charity going live this... 1 HOT PROPERTY: Humberston Avenue Humberston 1 Comments (0) They're still a bit of a gimmick but voice-controlled digital assistants on smartphones are still being heavily promoted by manufacturers with Apple and Google the current giants. While the funny answers delivered by Apple's Siri to silly questions such as "How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?" are always getting people laughing, are the virtual assistants actually any good? Google's Now search is set to be replaced by a more intelligent Assistant in the coming months on select devices but we were keen to find out which of the two is best for mining local information right now. Here's what we found … "When do Grimsby Town play next?" Siri decided the Mariners hadn't played since a defeat to Bolton Wanderers in November and had no more fixtures on the horizon. Google's offering was much more up-to-date with the next two fixtures accurately displayed. WINNER: Google Now "When do Cleethorpes Town play next?" A much tougher question for both given the side's relative obscurity on a national level. Needless to say Siri didn't have a clue but Google brought up the club's website fixture page meaning a single tap was needed to find the answer. WINNER: Google Now "When will my bins be collected next in Cleethorpes?" Bit of an open ended question this one as obviously it'll be different days in different areas but both Siri and Google managed to bring up search results where the answer would easily be found. WINNER: Tie "When is the next bus from Grimsby to Louth?" Siri just did a web search with a list of times whereas Google had more finesse as it listed the times within the browser along with the estimated duration of the journeys. WINNER: Google Now "Where is the Grimsby Telegraph?" Siri got in a real kerfuffle with this one, believing Telegraph HQ is on St Peter's Avenue, Cleethorpes, and still referred to the paper as the Grimsby Evening Telegraph despite the "Evening" being dropped years before the first iPhone was ever conceived! Google fared much better, finding the Telegraph in its current location at Fisherman's Wharf. WINNER: Google Now "Show me Indian restaurants in Cleethorpes" Both delivered good results though some would favour Google's approach of sorting by customers' ratings rather than the distance-from-current-location favoured by Siri. WINNER: Tie "Where is the nearest late-night pharmacy?" Bit of a fail on both fronts here with Siri opting for web search results while Google conjured up some nearby pharmacies – albeit including some which aren't open until late. As such, Siri's results are probably more useful. WINNER: Siri "When does Sainsbury's in Grimsby close tonight?" Siri had more comprehensive listings of Sainsbury's in the area with Google requiring a visit to the supermarket's website before you could even select the store you want information for. WINNER: Siri "When is the next high tide in Cleethorpes?" A very interesting result from Siri, bringing up a detailed table and graph from information engine Wolfram Alpha while Google dug up some relevant search results. WINNER: Siri "When is the next train from Grimsby to Doncaster?" As with the buses, Google has more detailed information and times within the browser whereas Siri demands you delve deeper into other websites. WINNER: Google Now "What is the weather in Grimsby today?" No problems for either here with built-in hour-by-hour conditions and temperatures. They more or less agreed on what it will be like too.

To meet the commitment, Ibiden will invest in more than 20 new renewable energy facilities, including one of the largest floating solar photovoltaic systems in the country. “We are proud to partner with suppliers like Ibiden who recognise that renewable energy investments are good for the environment and good for business,” Lisa Jackson, Apple’s Vice President for Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, said in a statement this week. Ibiden’s products help bring together the integrated circuitry and chip packages in Apple devices. Their renewable energy projects will produce over 12MW of solar power, more than the energy they need for Apple manufacturing and support Japan’s nationwide efforts to limit its carbon emissions. “Our products help Apple devices run smarter, and now we are powering our operations with smarter energy too. We are pleased to partner with Apple and lead the way in helping Japan meet its clean energy goals,” said Kyoichi Yamanaka, Managing Director of Ibiden’s Environment Group. Apple and its suppliers will be generating over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy for the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018, equal to taking over 400,000 cars off the road for a year. “As we continue our push to power our global operations with 100 per cent renewable energy, it is more important than ever that we help our manufacturing partners make the same transition to cleaner sources, and set an example for other companies to follow,” added Jackson. Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 per cent of its operations in 23 countries and more than 93 per cent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

SHEAR 7:50 PM ET President Trump’s $1.1 trillion spending plan envisions deep cuts to many government programs while leaving entitlements like Social Security untouched.

Restaurants Real Estate Home Business Uncertainty over trade rattles tech companies print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google Uncertainty over trade rattles tech companies By Ethan Baron / The (San Jose, Calif.) Mercury News Published Mar 10, 2017 at 09:20PM SAN JOSE, Calif. — That shiny new iPhone may say “assembled in China” on the back, but its origins are scattered around the world: wafers from Taiwan, modem chips and batteries from South Korea, displays from Japan, components from Europe and raw materials from Africa, Asia, Europe and the U.S. Now that complicated supply chain may put Apple — the world’s most valuable company — in the bull’s-eye as President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans consider sweeping import tariffs or a comprehensive border tax on incoming products, components and raw materials. But while Apple has been singled out by Trump before, the administration’s actions would affect a who’s who of Silicon Valley’s big name tech companies — which could see sales, revenue and access to global talent take a hit from new fees and the trade wars that could follow. “It’s a real mess,” said Marcus Noland, senior vice president at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington, D.C., think tank that supports free trade. Only two months into the Trump administration, it’s difficult to discern how an import tariff or border tax might take shape, but the president has said he wants to punish U.S. companies that make goods overseas to sell back home. Imposing new costs on imports would encourage domestic manufacturing and create jobs, Trump has argued. While campaigning, Trump mentioned a 45 percent import tariff on goods from China and 35 percent on imports from Mexico. More recent reports suggested the Trump transition team was looking at a 10 percent fee. House Republicans, meanwhile, have proposed a 20 percent “border adjustment tax” covering all imports from all countries. The list of firms with the most to lose from an aggressive new tariff or tax regime includes the valley’s biggest names: Google, Tesla, Oracle, HP, Cisco, Intel, Seagate, Western Digital, Nvidia, Marvell Semiconductor and more. Also standing to lose? Consumers who will inevitably have the increased costs from import tariffs or a tax passed on to them, according to experts. “You and I are going to pay for it,” said Georgia Tech professor John Vande Vate, who studies supply chains. However, others believe imposing higher import costs would deliver significant benefits. Northwestern University law professor Steven Calabresi said the proposed 20 percent border adjustment tax would “encourage Americans to buy American products” and “promote good jobs here in the United States” while raising $1 trillion over 10 years. “It will allow us to cut income taxes, which discourage people from working. It is smart to discourage a little bit of the buying of foreign goods if you can then cut income taxes and get people back into the workplace or get them to work harder,” he said last week in an op-ed in The Hill. Still, tariffs or a tax would also hit countries like China that export to the U.S., potentially leading to trade wars with nations whose markets and raw materials are critical to tech companies. “If we decide to impose tariffs or high barriers to trade on our trading partners we should expect reciprocal trade barriers, which of course is not good for our industries, it’s not good for prices, and the whole thing spirals downward,” said Renee Bowen, a Stanford University Graduate School of Business professor who studies international trade. Generally, when tariffs drive prices up, sales go down, said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a tech-focused think tank. The tech industry has long depended on a complex global network of suppliers, workers and materials. Apple, for example, noted in its most recent quarterly report that its manufacturing is concentrated among a small number of suppliers in Asia. “Everything that is in our products comes from overseas,” Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman told CNBC in February. “That supply chain has taken 30 years to set up. So when all those components come in and are taxed, it’s not going to be good. This does not create jobs. It actually lowers the number of jobs for many, many companies.” HP makes printers and PCs in China, while Cisco, Seagate and Western Digital manufacture products there and in Thailand, according to analyst Handel Jones of International Business Strategies in Los Gatos, California. Google’s new Pixel phones are made by HTC in Taiwan, where Nvidia and Marvell Semiconductor buy chips that power products sold in the U.S. The Home virtual-assistance device by Google is made in China, and the company relies on Taiwanese firm Quanta to supply the servers that make it a cloud-services titan. Facebook also buys servers from Quanta, according to analysis firm Moor Insights & Strategy. Intel has fabrication and assembly plants in China, and assembly facilities in Malaysia and Vietnam. 16682291 View next article in Business     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive County: Wind caused damage to closed Apple Valley library Friday Mar 10, 2017 at 5:36 PM Mar 13, 2017 at 12:49 PM Costs related to the closure and reconstruction of the Newton T. Bass Apple Valley Branch Library total more than $6 million. Reconstruction work is expected to begin by mid-April, and the library will remain closed another 12 months from that point. Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — Nearly two years after its abrupt closure, San Bernardino County officials have determined damage to the Newton T. Bass Apple Valley Branch Library was the result of wind. An initial site inspection in April 2015 revealed damage to six of the building’s supporting trusses. A second assessment on April 17 of that year found cracks in two more trusses, which prompted officials to close the library out of concern for the health and safety of workers and patrons. Six hundred and ninety-three days have passed since the library was indefinitely closed on April 18, 2015. A statement released from the office of 1st District Supervisor Robert Lovingood on Friday disclosed that “strong prevailing winds” led to to the cracking of the support trusses, causing the building’s sprinkler system to shift. “It has taken many months of inspections and studies by engineers for both the county and insurance companies to determine the extent of the problems and identify solutions,” the statement read. “At the time the library was built, it met all code requirements. But in the subsequent years, building code required truss systems to sustain higher winds, so the new roof and truss system will meet the new codes.” On Tuesday, a 4-0 vote of the county’s Board of Supervisors awarded a $4 million contract to construction firm Kitchell CEM for replacement of the library’s roof and trusses, according to county documents. The Apple Valley Library Roof Reconstruction Project’s total cost, however, stands at more than $6 million following approval of a $2.2 million increase to the budget, county documents show. Included in the total cost: $531,709 for a temporary library; $604,564 for project design; $300,327 for project management and inspection; and $183,400 for temporary shoring of the trusses to mitigate damage to the roof. Tuesday’s increase marks the second time the board approved such a matter. Initially, the project was budgeted at just under $3 million, according to county documents, but the board approved $880,000 more in June 2016 that bumped the amount to $3.8 million, county documents show. An additional $210,000 was set aside for any necessary changes or additions to the work during construction, which is expected to begin in mid-April and take a year to complete, according to Lovingood’s statement. Documents show that branch staff observed cracks in the truss system supporting the roof in November 2014 and reported the discovery to county officials, thus resulting in the initial inspection in April of the following year. On May 5, 2015, the board found that the “damage and failure of the structural supports for the roof” allowed for “the emergency design for the replacement of the roof structure and related interior repairs, temporary relocation of the facility, temporary shoring and costs associated with packing, moving and storing books, racks and furniture” housed within the library. Construction of the temporary library came 11 months later in early April of 2016, according to a previous Daily Press report. The board’s vote on Tuesday terminated the original findings. The temporary library opened April 30, 2016, contrary to Lovingood’s statement, which listed the opening date as “March 2016.” The Victor Valley Museum — also operated by the county — offered some services before the temporary library opened, though access to the Internet was not included. “As a parent with three children attending school in Apple Valley, I very much understand the importance of the library,” Lovingood said in his statement. “We are now on track to make repairs and reopening (sic) this important hub of activity for Apple Valley residents.” On Feb. 14, the Daily Press submitted a Public Records Act request for all county emails related to the closed library. On March 7, the county provided a CD containing more than 800 emails that are now under review. Additional emails are anticipated by March 31, according to a letter that accompanied the emails.

The Easiest Ways To Upgrade Your Computer Yourself David Nield Mar 11, 2017, 4:00pm ⋅ Filed to:  Australian Stories computing diy Share Upgrading your computer can be a great way to save a little cash. It can also be a great way to fulfil that need most gadget geeks have for getting cool new stuff on a regular basis. But upgrading can also be shockingly expensive if you're not careful (steer clear of Apple's overpriced RAM), and it can seem especially daunting to upgrade if you're not familiar with the insides of your computer. Yet there are many ways to upgrade your current setup without spending too much cash or needing a degree in computer science to tackle them. These are the DIY upgrades that will give you the most bang for your buck, and are shockingly easy to perform in an afternoon. Add more memory If the processor inside your computer determines how fast it can think, then the amount of RAM affects how much it can think about at any one time — opt for a memory upgrade and you'll be able to run more programs simultaneously and more smoothly, and you'll find larger files or multiple files are handled better too. Getting extra RAM sticks inside your machine isn't that expensive or that difficult to do, particularly if you're using a desktop computer with an extra memory slot or two free on the motherboard. Your first task is to identify what your motherboard is, and how much memory is already installed — you can either open up the case and take a look or run a diagnostics tool like CPU-Z or Apple's About This Mac to check for you. In the case of laptops the job is a lot trickier but not impossible for the casual computer user — how easy the task is can vary widely from model to model, so again you need to do some online research into the laptop you've got. As the video above from Brue Computing shows, you can do the job on a Dell laptop with a screwdriver, a plastic pry tool and a few minutes' spare time. Where possible find instructions for your exact make and model of computer, to minimise the chances of running into problems. Ifixit.com is a great resource for learning how to get into many laptops from major brands, including Dell, Apple, Samsung, and HP. Add more storage space Your computer doesn't like running out of storage space — besides losing out on a place to store that kitten video you downloaded for Youtube, you'll also find your computer runs a lot slower when the storage is nearly full. So anything you can do to keep a healthy chunk of storage space free is an upgrade that's well worth doing. Investing in an external hard drive and plugging it into a spare USB port is an upgrade that pretty much anyone can do. You won't be able to move your operating system files over to it, but you can shift all those photos, videos and other personal files to the external drive no problem. Just remember that you need to back them up somewhere else too, just in case your new external hard drive should fall into the fish tank. Fitting a second hard drive inside your case or even swapping out your original drive for a bigger one isn't as difficult as you might think, though in the latter case you have the added hassle of having to move your operating system, applications and files over at the same time. If you do decide to replace your internal hard drive, than switching from a mechanical hard drive to a speedy SSD can make a huge difference to the load times and running speed of your computer, as well as potentially giving you more storage space too. The comprehensive video above from Babbling Boolean is a great introduction to the process of adding an SSD drive to your system (and you can see the before and after speed difference too). The process is easier if you're working with a desktop computer with large hard drive bays but you can made the switch on most models of laptops too. Upgrade your input options Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo You may not think that buying a new mouse and keyboard is much of an upgrade for your computer, but you use these devices constantly, and buying new kit can feel like upgrading your whole machine (even though all the internal components are exactly the same). There are a lot of options out there and you don't need to spend much to get something of great quality. You could consider investing in a mechanical keyboard for a more pleasing typing experience or a dedicated gaming keyboard for all those FPS games you play. On the mouse side, upgrading to a model with more switches and options gives you access to more instant shortcuts — whether that's for Excel or No Man's Sky. Installation and setup can be done in seconds and then you're ready to go. For those who aren't particularly concerned with computer performance, or who already have computers that are running top-notch components, focusing on the devices you use to interact with your system is an upgrade path well worth considering. Buy a new (or second) display Image: Samsung As with keyboards and mice, adding a new display doesn't change anything about the core specs of your computer, but it can make the experience of using it a whole lot better. There are a couple of options here: upgrading to a bigger display from your original one or adding a second monitor. Both can make a big difference, letting you run programs side-by-side, or keep one app open constantly on one screen while you work on another. If you've never considered setting up a secondary monitor before, take our word for it that it's a lot more useful than you might realise: web browsing, office apps, playing music and video, all these tasks benefit from extra screen real estate, whether that's more room on one monitor or a second one available to the OS. And the upgrade is about as easy as they come as long as you can plug in both ends of an HDMI cable and find a power socket. If you're adding a second monitor then you need a desktop or laptop capable of powering two displays (most can), otherwise you can simply swap out one monitor for another and you're ready to go. However you set up your displays, both Windows and macOS should detect the changes instantly. Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

Or Sit On a Table? Siri? John Martellaro @jmartellaro Mar 10th, 2017 6:38 PM EDT | Particle Debris Our artificial intelligence agents can either be embedded in our computers and/or mobile devices. Or they can reside in a cute little cyhlinder that sits on a table. Which is better? Which is the future? Which should you invest in? Maybe Siri knows. _______________________ Apple’s CEO Tim Cook has said that our AI’s should always be with us. During Apple’s 2016 Q4 Earnings Call, he said: I think that most people would like an assistant with them all the time. I think the advantage of one on the phone will likely be much greater… we’ve shipped more assistant-enabled devices than probably anyone out there. And it’s true. In the 2016 holiday quarter, Apple shipped 78 million iPhones, 13 million iPads, and 5.4 million Macs. All of them have Siri. This doesn’t even include Apple Watches. The research firm Canalys estimates Apple sold 6 million of those last quarter. All in all, that’s over 100 million Siri enabled devices in one quarter. Meanwhile, how many Amazon Echos were sold? Consumer Intelligence Research estimates Amazon sold 5.2 million for all of 2016. Ouch. (Although I did see this fantasy just as I started to publish. I don’t believe it.) The Amazon Echo Dot is the Echo’s little brother. Why The Big Fuss? So why has the Echo made such a big splash? First, Amazon doesn’t make its own computers as Apple does. So Amazon, if it’s going to make its first break into the AI market, has to build those cute little stand-alone cylinders that sit on a table. And to sell a lot of them, the company’s ads have to be spectacularly good at explaining the benefits. By example. Apple, in contrast, isn’t doing much of that. Amazon has indeed done a good job of explaining and celebrating the Echo in its TV ads. Plus, the Echo and Echo Dot are good looking pieces of hardware bringing forth a tangible physical manifestation. However, the downside of these cute little cylinders is that when you leave the room, you’re out of contact. One solution is to buy a lot of them and spread them around the house. Unsavory. Or one can use some ingenious technology, like the Ninety7Life Vaux, a battery powered speaker system that cradles the Dot and allows you to move the pair from room to room. The Ninety7Life Vaux battery powered speaker also powers the Wi-FI Dot. But that seems so awkward. Will the users really remember to grab the Vaux and Dot pair every time they leave the room? Meanwhile, if your iPhone isn’t in your pocket, your Apple Watch certainly is on your wrist. Everywhere. Even the bathroom. Pros and Cons Recently, I spoke with Microsoft about this. Microsoft’s Ben Rudolph explained that Cortana is always with him, either in his office or in the Surface that he carries with him. Within the constraints of privacy, Cortana (and Siri) are embedded in your computing environment—which for many people is in their face all day long. The way Echo (and Google Home) work is to operate remotely and provide services (or Echo “skills”) via IoT, and that’s noted for not being particularly secure. And so, while the Amazon Echo and Echo Dot get a lot of attention, it’s primarily because they have the virtue of having a “face,” not being tied to a computer and exemplified by simple understandable features that are easily advertised. But, after all, they come from a company that doesn’t have Apple’s and Microsoft’s OS and computer expertise. The choice is made for Amazon. In the long run, I think there will be a small and stable market for these table-top AIs, but I like the way Apple and Microsoft think about the problem. With many hundreds of millions of Windows and iOS devices out there, the modern AI agent is going to manifest itself best in our mobile life. The numbers already prove it. Of course, when our family robots in 2022 start to follow us around, like puppies, all that could change. Next page: The news debris for the week of March 6th. The future of the Mac.

Displays time and timer, weather, recipes (How many cloves/minutes?), etc, all at once, C. Able to also play audio or video or Skype simultaneous to the above (B) capabilities, D. Can connect to other devices within the home for intercom, telecom or HomeKit uses. Apple would make this device, whether Apple makes the screen or not (say just a box like Apple TV) for security and ease of use. One could add similar connected touchscreens in other rooms as well. Isn’t this doable now with current technology? March 11, 2017 at 2:23 EDT PM Lee Dronick March 11, 2017 “Isn’t this doable now with current technology?” iPad, iPhone, and Apple Watch March 11, 2017 at 7:25 EDT PM wab95 March 12, 2017 John: To answer what I think is your rhetorical but relevant question, ‘Should our AI agents be always with us?’, let me begin with, ‘Yes’ and add, ‘Where else but with us would they be if they are to be useful in a changing environment?’. Implicit in that second statement is that the competitive advantage is granted to that AI that is present when you need it, which is wherever you are at the time. The reason that the iPhone has displaced more capable and feature-rich cameras is that the camera with the competitive advantage is the one that is with you when you need it. Natural selection favours the generalist that can thrive in the most climes and under the most wide-ranging conditions. That is the one that is most likely to proliferate beyond their original cradle and seize the most planetary real estate. Apart from this question of availability is the present imperative of security and user privacy. Given the far-reaching capacity of nation state actors and state sponsored intelligence gathering, to which no platform or device is entirely immune, the AI solution that is the most hardened and secure is the one that will best weather the storms of cyberattack and provide the most relative security. This is not unlike the old joke/proverb of two people out on the African savannah who spot a lion and one of them advises, ‘Run’ and the other replies, ‘You cannot outrun a lion’, and the first person responds, ‘I don’t have to outrun the lion; I only need to outrun you!’ An AI solution may not be able to withstand every assault, but if it is a higher reach than its competitors, then it may provide a relative advantage to its users. Apple’s solution, which does not entail user behavioural information being transmitted or stored centrally, may provide this advantage in the long run. Not unlike the tortoise vs the hare, while Siri may have slower pace in achieving Turing-level responsiveness than some of its competitors, if those competitors are more readily compromised, Siri is more likely to outcompete them in the long game – a game in which Apple remain invested. While we’re on the subject of AI, regarding the worry that AI will conduct a hostile takeover of all things human, or otherwise subjugate, enslave or annihilate homo sapiens…yawn. Let’s revisit this when the ‘I’ in AI becomes even remotely sentient, that is, characterised with aspiration, ambition and desire for self-betterment, let alone dominance; in other words, a real competitor for human hegemony. I’m with Michael Shermer on this one, and as I’ve argued before, this scenario rests on many assumptions about the quality and nature of that intelligence, no sign of which is remotely evident today. To borrow Andrew Ng’s example, human overpopulation of Mars poses a greater existential threat to human welfare today than does a malevolent AI. Daniel Eran Dilger, once again, provides a cogent and comprehensive argument as to why Apple have not invested the level of attention to the Mac Pro that many have clamoured for. I disagree with the argument that if SJ were still alive, the Mac would get more attention than it has of late. That argument appears to be based upon the observation of SJ’s attention to the Mac hardware lineup dating between one and two decades ago, ie pre-iOS. It is contradicted by that other oft-cited observation of SJ, namely his ability to lose interest in projects and drop products that he felt were not moving the company or the user base forward, not to mention his utter lack of sentimentality. Apple are not a charity, but a for-profit competitive concern, and in that field, an apex predator. They are trying to drive digital solutions, not preserve legacy solutions out of a misplaced sense of nostalgia or sentimentality. That requires preferential attention to their mobile platform, which as Dilger points out, is not only their primary profit-maker but drives innovative solutions for their Mac platform. More important is the big picture, namely that 21st Century solutions are increasingly distributed across devices and software on the front end and serviced by enormous computational resources, including in the form ofAI, at the backend. Those backend resources far exceed the computational power to which the vast majority of users would ever had access to for their most frequently used tasks at any point in prior history, and poses the greatest threat to investing separate time and attention to any single niche use case that is not so served, such as machines for rendering farms. And speaking of digital resources, IBM’s atom-sized magnet is a game changer, assuming it can be scaled to a consumer device. March 12, 2017 at 6:26 EDT PM geoduck March 13, 2017 One interesting observation: Siri works fine for me normally. However if I have my VPN on it won’t connect. Neither will Dictation. A bit of a security weakness, having to turn off VPN in order to use the feature and then having to remember to turn it on again.

Why Now? –IBM See More Vendor Resources Bringing data quality to the c-suite –DataFlux Corporation Legal Toolkit for Storage Systems –Storage Magazine We're currently living in an era of data analytics scarcity, according to analysts at this week's Gartner Data and Analytics Summit, an annual meeting of IT and analytics professionals. In other words, while we have an abundance of data -- perhaps too much -- there is a scarcity of insight and value derived from that data. That means one thing: IT leaders have a lot of work to do. "Expectations are sky high," said Gartner analyst Kurt Schlegel. "Your organization is expecting you to deliver on an expanded vision of data and analytics to drive its digital business strategy." No pressure, right? Schlegel and his Gartner colleagues believe that the world of data and analytics will have an even bigger impact on our society over the next 20 years than the internet has had in the last 20. They envision a future of analytics abundance in which data insights are applied to every process and every decision in every profession. The possibilities, they say, are practically limitless (the theme of the Gartner summit). But first, IT leaders and business leaders need to work together to turn our current data analytics scarcity into abundance. During the opening keynote, Schlegel and Debra Logan, a Gartner vice president and fellow, offered advice for achieving that: initiate an organizational restructuring, change the decision-making culture and harness emerging technology. It's time for a CDO IT leadership is becoming overwhelmed by the onslaught of data streaming in from new sources, like IoT-enabled devices, said Logan. The solution lies in a reorganization of organizational leadership, starting with the establishment of new leaders -- chiefly, the chief data officer (CDO). "We need CDOs to create a vision for the abundant use of data in their organizations," Logan said. "[The CDO's] job is leading the organizational change required to create and sustain enterprise-wide data analytics capabilities." Not only did Logan and Schlegel encourage attendees to consider the role as a possible next career step, several sessions at the Gartner summit focused on how to become a CDO and how to succeed as a CDO. It's clear this role is garnering a lot of attention. So, what exactly is expected of CDOs? According to Logan, in order to succeed CDOs must: Drive business outcomes with data Foster data-related cultural change Gauge the ethical implications of data management In Gartner's recent CDO survey, 67% of participants stated that their top priority as CDO was to be a champion and change agent within their organization; 61% said they were leading the effort to ensure that data analytics are integrated in the overall data and business strategy. But, as with many IT prerogatives, how these goals are achieved -- and who among the IT chiefs ends up shaping business strategy -- is not set in stone. "The relationship between the CDO and the CIO will remain crucial," said Jamie Popkin, a Gartner vice president and fellow. "Strategy development, decision-making power and funding will be sources of contention between IT leaders and the office of the CDO, as the role of the CDO becomes more broadly established." Organizational restructuring doesn't stop with the addition of the CDO position to the executive ranks. Logan also stressed to IT leaders the importance of a distributed organizational model. "Don't create an overly centralized organizational model," she said. "Analytics are pervasive; they're everywhere, in every department. Every process needs to use data to make decisions. That means that the skills and technology must also be distributed." If we rely on people only at the top of the data hierarchy, we're never going to reach data analytics abundance, Schlegel said, sounding a familiar call: IT leaders need to implement tools and processes to democratize data analytics. They need to help their companies turn information consumers (employees) into active and data literate users who can analyze data and drive new insights from that data. Time will tell, no doubt, whether data democracy is liberating or a job security threat for data analytics experts. Now to the other two factors that Gartner believes will help end our current data scarcity: fostering a data-driven culture and taking advantage of emerging tech.   Business decisions should have a digital trail The apotheosis of a true digital organization, according to Gartner, is one in which every process and decision is driven by data insights. Companies may tell themselves selves that they are data-centric, but are they really? The short answer: no. Based on Gartner's client interactions, the vast majority of data and analytics programs don't directly impact the decisions we make; the infamous "gut feeling" still often has the final say. "We fool ourselves into thinking we're making empirical decisions because we looked at the data, but, in reality, we are falling victim to a long list of cognitive biases: anchoring, group think, confirmation bias, halo effect, loss aversion," said Schlegel. "Ironically, decision making is too often the last business process to be digitized." There is usually no digital trace of how decisions are made, Schlegel said. He advises IT leaders to promote a new decision-making culture in which decisions made at your organization, along with being fully data-driven, are logged and tracked over time. To the tech Finally, IT organization must take advantage of emerging technology, the big one being machine learning. According to Logan, 10 years from now it'll be hard to find an application that doesn't use machine learning, so bulk up. Bots are already arriving, but even before bots we'll see several new advanced analytics technologies, like natural language question and answer and natural language generation, that will allow us to tap massive amounts of insights from data that would otherwise go unnoticed, said Schlegel at the Gartner summit. Automation of the analytics workflow is coming, with Gartner predicting that by 2019, 50% of analytics queries will be generated using search, natural-language query or voice, or will be autogenerated. Infrastructures need an update too, says Logan. "Traditional infrastructures are starting to break down in the face of multi-structured data, massive volumes of data, streams of data from things and, most importantly, the need to quickly adapt to change," she said. That's where data virtualization comes in, she says. Garter forecasts that by 2018, organizations with data virtualization capabilities will spend 40% less than organizations without those capabilities. CIO news roundup for week of March 6 The Gartner summit on data and analytics wasn't the only tech game in town this week: WikiLeaks unloads alleged CIA hacking files. Wikileaks on Tuesday released thousands of pages detailing how the CIA breaks into consumer devices such as smartphones and televisions. The release includes claims that the CIA and other intelligence services have compromised both Apple and Android smartphones by bypassing encryption on services such as Signal, WhatsApp and Telegram. Both Apple and Google responded quickly to the allegations, saying the vulnerabilities are out of date: In an official statement, Apple said that "many of the issues" detailed in the leaked documents have been addressed in updated iOS versions. Heather Adkins, Google's director of information security and privacy, said in a statement to CNET that after reviewing the documents, they are "confident that security updates and protections in both Chrome and Android already shield users from many of these alleged vulnerabilities." Meanwhile, Zeynep Tufekci, an associate professor at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, argued that the claim the CIA bypassed Signal and WhatsApp is "misleading." WikiLeaks said this week's document dump is only the first installment in a larger collection of secret CIA material. IBM targets quantum computing. IBM has set its sights on its next potential business opportunity: This week the company announced a new division called IBM Q that aims to build universal, commercially available quantum computing systems. These systems are based on the laws of quantum mechanics, and IBM claims they could create breakthroughs in areas such as medicine, financial services and artificial intelligence. "We envision IBM Q systems working in concert with our portfolio of classical high-performance systems to address problems that are currently unsolvable, but hold tremendous untapped value," said Tom Rosamilia, senior vice president of IBM Systems, in a press release. In other news from Big Blue, IBM announced it would partner with Salesforce.com Inc. on artificial-intelligence technologies.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive County: Wind caused damage to closed Apple Valley library Friday Mar 10, 2017 at 5:36 PM Mar 13, 2017 at 12:49 PM Costs related to the closure and reconstruction of the Newton T. Bass Apple Valley Branch Library total more than $6 million. Reconstruction work is expected to begin by mid-April, and the library will remain closed another 12 months from that point. Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — Nearly two years after its abrupt closure, San Bernardino County officials have determined damage to the Newton T. Bass Apple Valley Branch Library was the result of wind. An initial site inspection in April 2015 revealed damage to six of the building’s supporting trusses. A second assessment on April 17 of that year found cracks in two more trusses, which prompted officials to close the library out of concern for the health and safety of workers and patrons. Six hundred and ninety-three days have passed since the library was indefinitely closed on April 18, 2015. A statement released from the office of 1st District Supervisor Robert Lovingood on Friday disclosed that “strong prevailing winds” led to to the cracking of the support trusses, causing the building’s sprinkler system to shift. “It has taken many months of inspections and studies by engineers for both the county and insurance companies to determine the extent of the problems and identify solutions,” the statement read. “At the time the library was built, it met all code requirements. But in the subsequent years, building code required truss systems to sustain higher winds, so the new roof and truss system will meet the new codes.” On Tuesday, a 4-0 vote of the county’s Board of Supervisors awarded a $4 million contract to construction firm Kitchell CEM for replacement of the library’s roof and trusses, according to county documents. The Apple Valley Library Roof Reconstruction Project’s total cost, however, stands at more than $6 million following approval of a $2.2 million increase to the budget, county documents show. Included in the total cost: $531,709 for a temporary library; $604,564 for project design; $300,327 for project management and inspection; and $183,400 for temporary shoring of the trusses to mitigate damage to the roof. Tuesday’s increase marks the second time the board approved such a matter. Initially, the project was budgeted at just under $3 million, according to county documents, but the board approved $880,000 more in June 2016 that bumped the amount to $3.8 million, county documents show. An additional $210,000 was set aside for any necessary changes or additions to the work during construction, which is expected to begin in mid-April and take a year to complete, according to Lovingood’s statement. Documents show that branch staff observed cracks in the truss system supporting the roof in November 2014 and reported the discovery to county officials, thus resulting in the initial inspection in April of the following year. On May 5, 2015, the board found that the “damage and failure of the structural supports for the roof” allowed for “the emergency design for the replacement of the roof structure and related interior repairs, temporary relocation of the facility, temporary shoring and costs associated with packing, moving and storing books, racks and furniture” housed within the library. Construction of the temporary library came 11 months later in early April of 2016, according to a previous Daily Press report. The board’s vote on Tuesday terminated the original findings. The temporary library opened April 30, 2016, contrary to Lovingood’s statement, which listed the opening date as “March 2016.” The Victor Valley Museum — also operated by the county — offered some services before the temporary library opened, though access to the Internet was not included. “As a parent with three children attending school in Apple Valley, I very much understand the importance of the library,” Lovingood said in his statement. “We are now on track to make repairs and reopening (sic) this important hub of activity for Apple Valley residents.” On Feb. 14, the Daily Press submitted a Public Records Act request for all county emails related to the closed library. On March 7, the county provided a CD containing more than 800 emails that are now under review. Additional emails are anticipated by March 31, according to a letter that accompanied the emails.

Instead, the Cupertino giant could still be sticking with flat screens for its new iPhones, especially for the rumored 10th anniversary iPhone or the iPhone 8.  On Friday, MacRumors exclusively spoke with smartphone supply chain researcher and analyst Wayne Lam of IHS Markit about Apple’s upcoming iPhones for 2017. Based on Lam’s statement, there wouldn’t be a new iPhone with curved display as claimed by earlier reports. “We anticipate Apple will adopt a flat implementation of OLED design on their special iPhone model, which is analogous to the current 2.5D glass design,” he said.  Previously, rumors were running amok saying Apple is preparing a special iPhone with a curved 5.8-inch edge-to-edge OLED display. This special model is said to be the tech giant’s handset to commemorate the 10th anniversary of its famous smartphone series. What Lam is saying obviously contradicts the assumption that the iPhone 8 would come with curved display just like what Samsung is doing with its flagship Galaxy phones.  Lam instead said that consumers can expect a device that’s much like LG’s G6 flagship phone. ”Much like the recently announced LG G6, we anticipate a touchscreen with a new longer aspect ratio design to take advantage of higher coverage area of the iPhone in its entirety. This new design language is expected to become the trend for 2017, as we all anticipate Samsung's reveal later this month,” Lam explained. It can be noted that when LG unveiled its G5 successor, it stated that curved displays give an uncomfortable grip and build up more tension in the muscles of the hands, as first reported by Tech Times. Perhaps, Apple is also seeing these as the disadvantages of using a curved panel for its 10th anniversary iPhone. Nevertheless, if the Cupertino giant is indeed taking cues from LG, then fans would be happy to see a major redesign in the iPhone series. After all, the G6 comes with a striking appearance thanks to its unique screen-to-body ratio.  Lam said that having a large screen on a small body will be very beneficial to Apple. The company could expand certain features and functions of its iPhone due to the longer aspect ratio. On a final note, the analyst shared that it’s very likely for the next-generation iPhones to have Touch ID or the fingerprint scanner embedded into their display panels.    It’s not possible for Apple to release a new iPhone with curved display this year, accoring to a supply chain analyst.

But I cannot live with a bank that prioritises cheques over modern conveniences such as mobile payments (Stock picture) Spare a thought for the customer support staff of Bank of Ireland and AIB. Last week, both sets of teams were inundated with enquiries from hundreds of frustrated customers, wanting to know when they may get to use Apple Pay. Bank of Ireland took the worst of the flak as it doesn't even have Android Pay as an alternative. Instead, its policy is to issue cheque books. But paper IOUs finally look endangered. For those who missed it, Apple finally launched its Apple Pay mobile payments system into Ireland last week. In a nutshell, this system allows you to save your contactless credit card's details into your iPhone's digital 'Wallet' so that the iPhone becomes the physical object you use when paying for things at a contactless payment machine in a shop. It's incredibly handy. It's also pretty secure considering each payment requires your fingerprint, meaning a stolen iPhone is useless to the thief. But the country's two biggest banks decided to sit the launch out. In doing so, they handed a free pass to KBC and Ulster Bank, the two banks with which Apple Pay can be used. As a result, hundreds (perhaps thousands) of customers are now considering a move away from the big two banks. I am one of those customers. My bank, Bank of Ireland, is an especially egregious case when it comes to a lack of modern options. For its own reasons, it sat out the introduction of Android Pay last December, making it the only major bank not to have either Apple Pay or Android Pay. It has no problem issuing me with a chequebook, though. So now I'm looking to open an account with KBC or Ulster Bank. Quite apart from the issue of Apple Pay, this may be no bad thing. I'm fairly sure that moving bank almost always results in some saving anyway, regardless of extra benefits such as the use of Apple Pay. I'm also fairly sure that it's not an overreaction to consider moving away from a bank because they don't have a shiny new system. We all have some issue or other with our existing bank. An item such as Apple Pay is really just the nudge many of us need to look at our finances with a bit more diligence. This is especially so as most of us have probably been with the same bank for years out of sheer inertia. So I don't feel especially nerdy that it's the lack of Apple Pay that is finally pushing me into taking a proactive stance on my own banking habits. I can live with paying more in fees. But I cannot live with a bank that prioritises cheques over modern conveniences such as mobile payments. From the tsunami of negative feedback that Bank of Ireland got this week, I'm not alone. (To be fair, AIB also took it in the neck for not having Apple Pay. But it, at least, has mobile payments in the form of Android Pay. It also says it's in discussions with Apple about Apple Pay). Why do we want these mobile payment systems? I'd say it's because we're sick of flaky pieces of plastic. And we're sick of waiting in shop queues while others take ages unzipping wallets, tapping pin codes into terminals (which then sometimes take more time to process the transaction), replacing their cards, rezipping the wallet and replacing the wallet in their bags. We also may be looking for slightly better security. Just over a week ago, I got a call from my bank telling me my credit card had been compromised and I'd need to wait over a week until a new one was issued to me. This is currently causing me administrative chaos with everything from disrupted bin payments and M50 tolls to Spotify and Netflix subscription interruptions. Whether or not the card was physically compromised or hacked from some website isn't that important because I'm pretty sure that using Apple Pay (or Android Pay) in future would be more secure. This is because paying in a shop (or online) using Apple Pay or Android Pay doesn't always require the kind of physical disclosure of sensitive data (such as the three-digit CVV security number) that physical cards require. The whole system is based on a more secure, encrypted form of transaction that uses one-time dynamic codes. For me, this means that I'm less likely to be called up by the bank and told that someone has withdrawn €200 from an ATM in Seville using what appears to be my card. It also means a slightly thinner physical wallet and less of a necessity to keep changing cards when they disintegrate or bug out from being placed next to other cards in the same wallet. While I can't completely divest my affairs from Bank of Ireland (I have a mortgage, for example), a few enquiries last week showed me that it's quite easy to switch a lot of current account stuff without too much hassle. In the case of one of the Apple Pay banks, KBC, there also appears to be a fee-less option once a balance of €2,000 is maintained. An alternative option to switching banks is Boon, a prepay system that works by downloading an app and topping up via a prepaid digital Mastercard. It works in any shop whose terminals accept the Mastercard contactless logo. But that may be too restrictive. I'm not crazy about the thought of a constant top-up system where shortfalls may take days to rebalance. So I'm going to try one of the other banks. I'm willing to do this just so I can use an iPhone as a payment tool. But in the process, I bet I'll save money on my day-to-day banking costs.

Last year he was outraged when he attended a campaign rally in San Jose and saw violent anti-Trump protesters attacking Trump supporters. Sharyl Attkisson: "Did you post these feelings online?" Torba: "Yes." Attkisson: "On what?" Torba: "On Facebook, on Twitter, I wrote a blog about it. And immediately - without getting into any of the issues or anything - I was automatically labeled a racist, a bigot, etcetera. Venture capitalists, people that I respected and had worked with on a very close level, that just wrote me off completely and blacklisted me completely." Torba is now living in self-imposed exile in Texas, fighting what he sees as growing control of information online. He’s started his own version of Twitter called Gab. Attkisson: "What was the idea behind it?" Torba: "The idea behind it is that news, information, and communication is really monopolized on the internet by a select group of people. About four or five leaders in one of the most progressive cities in the world with some of the most progressive workers in the world. And what I saw happening as a conservative in Silicon Valley was an agenda being pushed and the conservative side and conservative ideas being suppressed." It’s not only conservatives like Torba who believe there’s an epic struggle underway to control information. Liberals and nonpartisans also complain of censorship, bias and fake news. We’re steeped in the most intense propaganda wars since World War II. That’s when the Nazis and the Allies fought for their citizens’ hearts and minds, devising propaganda campaigns to demoralize the enemy. Today’s battleground in the information wars: TV and the web. Islamic extremist terrorists openly recruit online. U.S. officials say Russian President Vladimir Putin exploited state-controlled TV news to discredit Hillary Clinton. Covert warfare is also widely being waged by U.S. political and corporate actors. Attkisson: "When people get online every day and take part in social media or do searches for news, what is it you think they don't know?" Matthew Brown: "I don't think they know they're being manipulated." Brown is a data analyst who pierces the secrecy behind paid efforts to influence online. Attkisson: "What areas of the internet are used to shape and manipulate opinion?" Brown: "Everywhere social. Everywhere social means specific Facebook pages, but it also means the comment sections in every major newspaper." Brown began investigating after his health insurance costs tripled and he commented about it on the Obamacare Facebook page. He got bombarded, he says, by digital activists disguised as ordinary people. Brown: "Digital activists are paid employees; their purpose is to attack anyone who's posting something contrary to the view the page owner wants expressed." Brown decided to use analysis software to crunch the numbers. He evaluated 226,000 pro-Obamacare posts made by 40,000 Facebook profiles. What he found was remarkable. Brown: "60 percent of all the posts were made from 100 profiles, posting between the hours of 9 and 5 Pacific time." Attkisson: "Which means what?" Brown: "They were paid to post." Brown says it’s rampant on social media. One popular tool: “zombie profiles” that make automated “robo” posts. Brown: "A zombie post is a fake, purchased, or rented Facebook profile that's expressing the views of an organization as if it was his or her own. But, when in reality, the comment being expressed is done on software and written by generally one or two people. So, the zombie posts will go out on a schedule and then they are supported by zombie likes." Attkisson: "Is there any reason to believe Republicans don't do the same thing and corporations as well?" Brown: "There’s no reason to believe that everybody’s not doing it." Even the government is in the game. Leaked emails show the feds seeking “persona management” software to “allow 10 personas per user.” They talk of creating an “army” of fake social media profiles maintained by actors “gaming” to hide their true location, and using “tricks” to “add a level of realness … to all fictitious personas.” Campaign 2016 brought higher stakes and a new name to internet efforts to manipulate public opinion: fake news. Unsubstantiated rumors about both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton went viral. There was "Pizzagate," which claimed Clinton associates were running a child sex ring from a pizza parlor. Trump was accused in a case of child rape. In October, President Barack Obama unveiled a push to “curate” the news. Obama: "We are going to have to rebuild within this wild, wild West of information flow some sort of curating function that people agree to." The news media quickly joined the president’s call. After a man motivated by Pizzagate rumors fired a gun in the pizza parlor, Clinton added her voice to the cause. Clinton: "It is now clear that so-called fake news can have real-world consequences. This is not about politics or partisanship. Lives are at risk, lives of ordinary people just trying to go about their days to do their jobs, contribute to their communities. It's a danger that must be addressed and addressed quickly." Facebook announced an initiative to stop fake news. The head of the left-wing group Media Matters told donors the group played a “critical role” in forcing Facebook’s hand. But the fix involved using fact-checkers who many conservatives see as biased. Conservatives point to fake news in the mainstream media, like the false report claiming Trump had removed a bust of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. from the White House. Trump: "Zeke, from Time magazine, writes a story about, I took down - I would never do that because I have great respect for Dr. Martin Luther King. But this is how dishonest the media is." PART 2 Attkisson: What do you define as fake news? Susan Glasser: "Well, as a term, right? It's like any term and in fact now you see partisans of both parties appropriating and using this label merely to apply it to news that they don't like." Glasser was editor of the left-leaning Politico during the 2016 campaign. Glasser: "So, what started out as a panic over fake news and what role it had in undermining Hillary Clinton's candidacy and promoting Donald Trump's candidacy, by the way, is now a label that Donald Trump, master marketer, has seen is a powerful label, so he's appropriated that and slapped that label on stories that he merely doesn't like." Trump: "You are fake news … go ahead." Glasser: "It's not that it didn't exist before, but Americans used to know the difference between The National Enquirer at the checkout counter and The New York Times. Public suspicion and allegations of bias hound the most pervasive internet players: Twitter, Google and Facebook." During the presidential campaign, critics discovered when doing a Google search for "Hillary Clinton indictment" that typing in "ind" didn't suggest "indictment." When you type "Hillary Clinton ind" into Bing or Yahoo, there are plenty of indictment-based recommendations. When you type it into Google the top two recommended autocompletions are "Hillary Clinton Indiana" and "Hillary Clinton India." As it happens, Google's parent company, Alphabet, was a top Clinton donor. Its chief executive worked on the Clinton campaign. Last year, former Facebook insiders alleged they "routinely suppressed news stories of interest to conservative readers." Attkisson: "We hear from a lot of people that they don't trust Politico or Facebook or Google or whoever it might be that's trying to sort through the truth or the facts." Glasser: "We're looking at a crisis of faith in institutions, the media being one set of institutions that is under assault. More broadly, political parties, you know, no longer have the trust and the faith." Torba claims Twitter censors conservatives, but not liberals for similar behavior. On Gab anything goes, he says, as long as it's legal, not inciting violence, and not exposing information like credit cards. Torba: "What we're doing is instead of us playing Big Brother and, you know, curating content and deciding what is news and what isn't and what people should see and what they shouldn't, we are giving the power to you as a user so you can mute different words, trends, hashtags, phrases, topics and users." Because of Gab's anti-censorship policy, it's attracted plenty of detestable users. Some blogs call it "Twitter for racists" and "the alt-right's very own Twitter." Torba: "The media likes to label us as alt-right or they've said, you know, Nazi Twitter or the Twitter for racists. I find it, you know, really funny because we have one of the most diverse starting teams of all time. So, we have my co-founder who is a Turkish Kurd and he's also Muslim. We have our chief communications officer who is based in Canada, who is an Indian and a practicing Hindu." If there's ultimate truth in the debate over manipulation of information, it may be found in asking not "What can you believe?" but "Who wants you to believe it and why?" Attkisson: "Do you favor censoring information that someone has decided is untrue or may blatantly be untrue so that the public can't access it online?" Glasser: "I don't. I think that would be a terrible mistake. We have to find a way for truth to regain its value in our public discourse, I think, and that's not about stopping people from what is untrue. It's about finding ways to reinvigorate the conversation around which is true and to find out that which those who are powerful don't want us to know." Attkisson: "What would your advice be to somebody who's taking part either in social media or looking for information on the web?" Brown: "My advice would be not to believe any of it. Take it all with a grain of salt." close News In Pictures Family of missing Spruce Pine man want to know why it took so long to find him UPDATE: Authorities investigate after toddler found dead on front porch Charges filed in vicious beating posted to Facebook Transformus seeks new location after talks break down with Mills River host Trending 1   UPDATE: Authorities investigate after toddler found dead on front porch 2   Family of missing Spruce Pine man want to know why it took so long to find him 3   BI-LO ends fuelperks, begins loyalty program 4   Transformus seeks new location after talks break down with Mills River host 5   Car crashes into animal hospital in Franklin DON'T MISS OUT Stay Connected with WLOS Like Follow © 2016 Sinclair Broadcast Group TermsPrivacyFCC InfoEEO LOADING ShareTweet × Trending 1 UPDATE: Authorities investigate after toddler found dead on front porch 2 Family of missing Spruce Pine man want to know why it took so long to find him 3 BI-LO ends fuelperks, begins loyalty program 4 Transformus seeks new location after talks break down with Mills River host 5 Car crashes into animal hospital in Franklin 6 Late season winter blast comes with pros and cons 7 Henderson County water controversy may be decided by state lawmakers 8 Reality Check: How to get a checkup from the neck up in minutes 9 Bone-chilling cold takes toll on some apple varieties in WNC 10 Driver cited after colliding with salt truck on I-40

The code contains what WikiLeaks referred to as a "hacking arsenal" of malware, viruses, trojans, and weaponized "zero day" exploits for iOS devices, that could give anyone in possession of the code "the entire hacking capacity of the CIA." This "Year Zero" release is the first in the full Vault 7 series by WikiLeaks, and is said to act as an introduction to the capacity and means of the CIA's covert hacking program. The agency's abilities can take aim at a number of popular consumer products from companies like Apple, Google, Samsung, and Microsoft, turning everything from an iPhone to a smart TV into a "covert microphone." In its analysis of the released documents, WikiLeaks looked at how iPhones and iPads have been targeted by the CIA in the past, and how they can continue to be exploited in the future. Although Android remains a dominant force in the global smartphone market, WikiLeaks argued that a "disproportionate focus" has been placed on iOS devices by the CIA, most likely due to the Apple-branded phone's popularity. Because of this, the agency has a specialized unit in place within the Mobile Development Branch that creates and executes malware to infiltrate, take control of, and exfiltrate sensitive information from iOS products. The MDB's methods are said to include a collection of zero day exploits, which are vulnerabilities in a piece of software unknown by the software's creator and subsequently exploitable by hackers. Including the iOS malware, WikiLeaks claimed that the CIA has recently "lost control" of the majority of its hacking arsenal. Despite iPhone's minority share (14.5%) of the global smart phone market in 2016, a specialized unit in the CIA's Mobile Development Branch produces malware to infest, control and exfiltrate data from iPhones and other Apple products running iOS, such as iPads. CIA's arsenal includes numerous local and remote "zero days" developed by CIA or obtained from GCHQ, NSA, FBI or purchased from cyber arms contractors such as Baitshop. The disproportionate focus on iOS may be explained by the popularity of the iPhone among social, political, diplomatic and business elites. WikiLeaks noted that in the wake of Edward Snowden's NSA leaks, a group of technology companies convinced the Obama administration to disclose any zero day exploits and bugs to each company, rather than hoard the information. The Vulnerabilities Equities Process underlined this agreement in 2010, and the U.S. government said it would reveal any vulnerabilities discovered to the company in question. Documents in Year Zero paint a further negative image for the CIA, which is said to not have abided by the agreement between the technology companies and the U.S. government. An example was given by WikiLeaks centering on one malware that can control both the Android phone and iPhone software "that runs or has run presidential Twitter accounts." The government is said to not have brought the information forward to Apple or Google in the time it has had the hacking data. As long as the CIA keeps these vulnerabilities concealed from Apple and Google (who make the phones) they will not be fixed, and the phones will remain hackable. The same vulnerabilities exist for the population at large, including the U.S. Cabinet, Congress, top CEOs, system administrators, security officers and engineers. By hiding these security flaws from manufacturers like Apple and Google the CIA ensures that it can hack everyone at the expense of leaving everyone hackable. The scope of the new WikiLeaks documents includes detailed information on the iOS exploits, hacks that could potentially infest vehicle control systems, and even attacks against Samsung smart TV sets. This last point, dubbed "Weeping Angel," was said to have been developed by the CIA in conjunction with the United Kingdom's MI5 as a way to convert turned-off television sets into secret microphones. The full list of the Year Zero documents can be found on WikiLeaks, and complete analysis of the documents by independent security experts will take some time in order for the impact of the release to be determined.

The iconic MacBook Air has been put out to pasture, the new MacBook Pro distinctly underwhelmed creative types, and I can’t even remember the last time anyone said anything about the Mac Pro. In the meantime, Chromebooks are taking off, and even Microsoft has started to do interesting things again. But hardware aside, there’s still something that Apple does far better than competition: customer service. According to Laptop Mag’s Tech Support Showdown list, Apple headily beats the competition for the quickest and best customer service of any major manufacturer. Don't Miss: Leak: Can the iPhone 8 compete with a Galaxy S8 that looks like this? The rankings are produced by real-world testing, where Laptop Mag gets editors to try the phone and live chat support features of each manufacturer. They get a grade based on the speed of support and quality of information, which feeds into an overall score. Apple won the test outright, with an overall 93/100 and an average call time of just six minutes. Laptop Mag said that “Apple offers the best tech support in the business, year after year. The company’s website and mobile app are loaded with helpful, step-by-step tutorials and, whether you reach them via phone or live chat, support reps are knowledgeable and friendly. Apple also answered Twitter messages quickly and accurately.” The only real complaint was an occasional lack of knowledge about new features. That’s to be expected, especially given that Apple’s reps are responsible for supporting more than just hardware. Acer, a company that’s long had a reputation for poor support, actually moved into second place in this year’s test, with a score of 88. Lenovo and Microsoft were next, while Asus, Samsung and MSI round out the bottom. It’s not as easy as blanket-comparing specs, but knowing how good a company’s tech support is can make or break a product experience. I’ve ended up contacting support for almost every laptop I’ve ever owned, and the result can be the difference between your problem being fixed in an afternoon, or being without a laptop for weeks after sending it for service.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is working on its next generation iPhone 8, also called ‘iPhone Edition’ in some quarters. The tech space is agog with rumors and leaks on what we can expect from the next iPhone. The iPhone 8 is not likely to make its debut until September but buyers can’t seem to hold their peace as we await the device. The reason for the huge interest in the iPhone 8 is not farfetched—to start with, the iPhone 8 will be the first iPhone to sport a massive change in design since the 2014 iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S. Apple doesn’t usually make massive changes to the design of the iPhone – the firm is content to adopt a ‘don’t fix it if it is not broken’ approach. However, there has been endless chatter about how Apple’s iPhone sales volume is peaking. People think sales is slowing because newer models of the iPhone seem to only sport marginal improvements over the previous models.  Hence, Apple needs to roll out its innovative drum to unleash a radically different iPhone 8.   Meet the ‘realest’ mockup of Apple’s iPhone 8 AlHasan Husni a graphic designer on Dribble might have created the iPhone mockup designs closest to what you can expect when Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) eventually unveils the device in September.  In his words, “the future of the iPhone could be here. Virtual home bar & fingerprint, Dark mode with curved OLED Screen & featuring the New way to access Multitasking View.” Husni’s mockup features a bold design with a 5.8 inches AMOLED screen for shaper colors and a more real-life feel. The device will also sport a bezel-less/thin-bezel display that practically the phone’s full face. The device is also expected to have a curved edges that extends the screen real estate beyond the face of the device. Interestingly, some critics have hinted that the mockup looks weirdly similar to the design of Samsung’s Galaxy 8.   To see a list of high yielding CDs go here.   Husni’s mockup also suggests that Apple will discard the physical home button in the iPhone in line with previous leaks and rumors. The iPhone 8 will most likely have a virtual home bar with haptic feedback in order to provide more screen real estate. It also appears that Apple will embed the fingerprint scanner into the display of the device. Some analysts have also suggested that the fingerprint sensor might be embedded in the curved side of the screen in order to enable fingerprint access when you pick up the phone without actually putting your thumb on a dedicated fingerprint scanner. The iPhone 8 might turn out to be a bit different from Husni’s mockup; yet, there’s no denying the fact that his design closely matches earlier iPhone 8 leaks. Apple files new patent that could make iPhone 8 ‘Insanely Great’ Critics have vocally condemned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for losing its innovative edge especially with rivals such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) unleashing innovative devices such as the Surface Studio. However, Apple recently filed a patent for “enhanced face detection using depth information“, which it might embed in the iPhone 8. In simple terms, the patent could allow the iPhone 8 camera to capture depth information for enhanced facial recognition security. The patent could also provide the iPhone 8 with 3D sensing features for AR or VR. Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Digital Trends Nuheara IQbuds review Nuheara’s brilliant wireless IQbuds are clever and clear enough to cut out clutter Share DT Editors' Choice The IQbuds not only deliver on their promises, they exceed expectations The IQbuds not only deliver on their promises, they exceed expectations The IQbuds not only deliver on their promises, they exceed expectations Highs Excellent speech optimization Impressive music streaming Good battery life Fully customizable sound characteristics Easy switching between music, phone, and speech Lows Wind noise can be annoying DT Editors' Rating 9.0 DT Editors' Choice Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Headphone Reviews > Nuheara IQbuds review By Bruce Brown Posted on 03.07.17 Research Center: Nuheara IQbuds Nuheara’s IQbuds are among of the first truly wireless earbuds that promise to help you understand speech. They’re very good for listening to music and for hands-free phone calls, but their best feature is their voice augmentation. The IQbuds’ primary purpose is to simultaneously help people control ambient sound and boost speech, and they exceeded our expectations. The earbuds don’t pretend to be hearing aids — they are not medical devices and won’t restore hearing. But if you could use a little boost in others’ speech volume and in separating speech from background noise (like this reviewer), these are the wireless buds for you. Out of the Box Inside the IQbuds’ Apple-esque box you’ll find the earbuds, a portable charging case, and a 12-inch USB charging cable. The charging case has four LEDs on its front lip to indicate the relative charge status of the case itself, plus two more LEDs inside which indicate whether the earbuds’ batteries are charging or full. Accessories include four sizes of earbuds (S, M, L, XL) in both round and oval shapes, written instructions, and even a thank you card with a $20 discount code from Nuheara to share or use yourself — a nice touch. Setup Like virtually all true wireless earbuds, the first step is to fully charge the earbuds in their case. It takes 1.5 hours to charge the IQbuds, and 2.5 hours to fully charge the case, so the best idea is to plug them in for 4 hours. You can check the charging status without opening the case by pushing a small button in front — a short press shows the earbud status and a longer press shows the case charging status. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Next is choosing the ear tips that give you the best fit. The goal is to fully block the ear canal without sacrificing comfort — we found the large oval ear tips fit best. To pair the IQbuds with your phone, open the IQbuds app, put in the buds, and touch and hold the outer surfaces of both for 5 seconds. The buds verbally announce “pairing,” and then you complete the process using your smartphone’s Bluetooth settings. Features and Design The IQbuds are similar in design to Bragi’s Dash Earphones, and Doppler Labs’ Here Ones. Two small openings on each bud for integrated microphones let you listen to music or phone calls without missing sounds around you. The earbuds sport L and R indicators on their inner surfaces to make it easy to tell them apart. Music streaming and hands-free calling was impressive. Touching the side of each ‘bud controls different features: A single tap on the left earbud plays or pauses music from your phone. If a phone call comes in, music shuts off and a single tap answers the call. A long tap rejects the call or hangs up a call in progress. Single tapping the right earbud toggles voice augmentation mode on or off. A long tap switches location profiles, and double-tapping either bud activates Siri or Google Now. All other controls and configuration settings are handled by Nuheara’s proprietary smartphone app, which we’ll get into below. As for battery life, in our tests the IQbuds lasted for 3.5 hours playing continuous music or about 5.25 hours with just the sound filters on a single charge. We tested the sound augmentation both with the default settings and with our own configuration, which were quite close. In comparison, Doppler Labs’ Here One offer only 2 hours of music streaming and around 3 hours of sound augmentation. The app The IQbuds’ app is relatively straight forward, though it may take some time go get the hang of it. In the Personal Profile app setting page, you can set overall amplification, relative volume for each ear, and frequency boost settings. Similar to Doppler Labs’ Hear One earbuds, the app also allows you to set up a personal hearing profile and then configure different location settings, adjusting general location noise and speech handling based on the real-world sound characteristics of each. There are eight location-based filters available, including Home, Driving, Restaurant, Office, Workout, Street, Plane, and Music. Only four can be selected directly from the IQbuds, so those four are the ones you select in the app as favorites by tapping on a heart icon. More: Human’s Sound ear covers aimed at meeting all of your audio needs For each of the eight locations you first configure IQVolume, which controls the ambient sound using a circular slider. The default for several settings — always a good place to start — is with the slider set to around 2 or 3 o’clock. Next you set what Nuheara calls Super Intelligent Noise Cancellation, or SINC. This is the setting that helps separate voices from the ambient sound. The default setting varies by location, but a good place to start is one hour ahead of the IQ Volume. So if the overall volume setting is 3 o’clock, set the SINC level at 4 o’clock. Last you can click Live EQ and, using another circular slider, adjust noise cancellation based on frequencies. You can always reconfigure the location settings through the app and they reset in the earbuds. It took us about a week testing various locations to get the sound settings right for our hearing. Once it was set, we made very few changes. To assist those with balance issues between ears, there are also two vertical bars with slider adjustments for each ear. If you want general sound amplification, move the sliders to the center position on each side and then adjust them relative to each other so the sound is centered. In our testing we listened to music and moved the sliders up or down until the lead singer’s voice was centered. There are five equalizer settings available here, and you can adjust them separately for each ear. Nuheara’s Blend mode, which you adjust with the Music location settings, allows you to listen to music or phone calls without missing sounds around you. With that setting properly configured, we were surprised how clearly we could hear someone speaking while we still rocking out. Comfort The two measures of a good fit with earbuds are comfort and performance. Choosing the proper ear tip is often the key for both. Within about a week we started to forget we even had the earbuds in our ears, which speaks volumes about the comfort level you can achieve with the right fit. Daily Performance It takes about 1.5 hours to recharge the IQbuds from zero, but we weren’t wearing them all day and it was easy to keep them charged. When we took them out, they went into the charging case, and every second or third day we’d plug in the case overnight. Of course we’d like longer battery life, but in our real world use we never ran out of power. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Like many other true wireless earbuds in the current generation, Nuheara’s IQbuds employ NXP’s wireless Near Field Magnetic Induction (NFMI) to synchronize sound between the two earbuds. We never noticed a difference in synchronization between left and right. Special notes about daily use: Wind noise outside is notable with the slightest breeze, and when we wore the earbuds while eating we could hear our own chewing. Nuheara claims to be working to cancel or minimize those sounds. After two weeks we acclimated to both sounds, so, while they’re a bit of a bother, neither is a buzzkill. Music playback and phone calls Music playback and hands free phone calls were both very impressive with the IQbuds. Listening to a variety of musical styles via Spotify exceeded expectations. We were pleased at the depth of the bass, clear upper frequencies, and easily discernable mid-range sound – a frequency range which tends to by jumbled in far too many headphones, we’ve found. Nuheara IQbuds Compared To Erato Muse 5 Here One Jabra Sport Elite Jaybird X3 Apple AirPods Sol Republic Amps Air NuForce BE Sport 3 Jabra Sport Pulse Wireless Special… Jabra Halo Smart Plantronics BackBeat Go 3 Erato Apollo 7 Bragi Dash Jabra Sport Pace Wireless Jabra Sport Pulse Jabra Sport Wireless Plus Bluetooth Voice calls tended to be loud and crisp. When we asked people on the phone how we sounded, they did not know we were using earbuds and noticed none of the fairly common Bluetooth issues, such as voices fading into the background. Speech Enhancement While the IQbuds are great for music and phone calls, those looking for music streaming first don’t need to pay $300 for IQbuds — there are plenty of other choices at half the price. Noise cancellation and voice augmentation to better hear other people’s speech is why most people will choose hearables in this price bracket. We tested the IQbuds for speech enhancement in a wide range of settings, including restaurants, networking meetings, a crowded church, and driving on the highway, In our first few tests we were surprised how clearly we could hear other people both sitting directly across from us in a loud deli and across a meeting room with hard acoustics. The voices weren’t louder, but they very more clear. It was the first time in years we heard every speaker introduce themselves at a networking meeting. Within about a week we started to forget we even had the IQbuds in our ears. The improved ability to understand what other people were saying was dramatic, compared to this reviewer’s normal issues with speech clarity. When we ate at the loudest restaurant in town, sitting in the middle, we didn’t have to ask our lunch companion or the waiter to repeat even once. Driving on the highway in a SUV we were aware of loud tire noise. After dialing back the ambient sound setting at the next stop, the noise was much duller and no longer interfered with conversation. In the middle of a large church packed with 500-600 people, for the first time ever we heard the directionality of sound, from the choir to the speakers. Loud clapping that begins each service was dramatically reduced. More: Nuheara’s IQbuds: Our first take Probably the most dramatic improvement was in a home setting, where our incessant need to ask family members to repeat themselves was greatly reduced. All in all, Nuheara’s IQbuds ability to improve voice comprehension was superlative, and significantly better than we’d hoped for. Warranty information Nuheara has a limited one-year warranty in the U.S. Nuheara at its option will repair or replace the product or refund the purchase price. Our Take The IQbuds passed every test we threw at them. Our primary focus was measuring their ability to help those with moderate hearing loss to understand speech in various settings, and they performed beyond our expectations. They also offer impressive music playback and handsfree calling, with battery life that far exceeds their only real competition in the new “hearbles” genre, the Here One. Is there a better alternative? As frequently referenced, the IQbuds’ only real competitors are the Doppler Labs’ Here Ones, but the difference in battery life puts the IQbuds ahead for our money. In fact, we wish the IQbuds’ 3.5-hour battery was longer. Those looking for gobs of features could also check out Bragi’s Dash, but those come with their own issues, and they don’t offer ambient sound augmentation. When it comes to features and usability, the IQbuds at this point are the best of the bunch. How long will they last? The DT Accessory Pack Comply premium foam earphone tips $20 Lowepro Newport 10 case $5 TrackR Bravo key tracker $80 Flux Portable 4000 mAh charger $30 Truly wireless hearables focused on improving speech hearing such as the IQbuds are a brand new wearables category, and competition will only increase to meet what is likely to be massive demand. However, Nuheara claims the IQbuds’ software and firmware will be updated over time, helping them keep up with future generations. The earbuds and the charging case appear to be sturdy — both survived waist-high drops in various settings. Assuming the batteries last, you should expect years of use. Should you buy them? Buy them if you need help hearing what other people say but don’t think (or want to think) you need a real hearing aid. The IQbuds’ music playback is very good and they are great for hands-free phone calls, but they shine brightest in settings where ambient noise makes it tough to hear others. More: Here One wireless sound-augmenting earbuds: Our first take Don’t buy the IQbuds if you are deaf or have severe hearing loss; they are not medical hearing aids and will not restore hearing. They do not reduce or cancel tinnitus. If you need more than 3.5 hours of music playback or 5.25 hours of speech enhancement, either lower your expectations or give these a pass.

The opportunities presented by a capable and ubiquitous communications system and a global transportation network have taken some corporations from the multinational to the status of truly global mega-corporation. Good examples of these new corporations include Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. There are a handful of large-scale winners in this space and many losers. But this is not the first time we've witnessed a period of rapid technological and social change. The Gilded Age In 1873, Mark Twain in collaboration with Charles Dudley Warner wrote and published a novel titled "The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today". The book was remarkable in that its title quickly became synonymous with the concerns of the time relating to graft, materialism, and corruption in public life. The novel's title is a play on the term "Golden Age," where the Gilded Age has only a thin layer of overt prosperity, social justice, and political integrity, masking a far baser society that was struggling with poverty, inequality, and injustice. The novel's satirical treatment of political and social life in Washington are about a period of rapid societal change and the inability of society's traditional institutions to adjust and come to terms with the rapidly changing social and industrial landscape. The age to which this novel gave its name was a period of rapid change in the United States. The Civil War in the US was perhaps the first of the major industrial age wars, where the expansion of communications and transportation infrastructure, by way of the telegraph and railways, were complemented by the investment in industrial capacity to raise and support formidable land armies. Once this capacity was in place, the challenge was to divert and repurpose this production capacity at the end of the war. This was the so-called "Reconstruction Era" of 1865–1877. Among other measures at that time was the state-sponsored construction of railroads, which was thought could transform the South out of isolation and endemic poverty. The euphoric response to this injection of public capital into the national economy was, of course, a highly fragile, and the large-scale public spending program all but ensured the ensuing economic crash of 1873. 1901 US cartoon from “Puck” depicting John D. Rockefeller as a powerful monarch (Wikipedia)However, the industrial capacity of the country was undiminished by this crash, and with the assistance of millions of European immigrants, there followed in the 1880's a period of rapid economic growth, this time using speculative private investment rather than public capital. Wages for the industrial labor force grew by 48% between 1880 and 1890. However, the rewards of all this economic expansion were not well distributed across all parts of American society, so it was also a time of extreme poverty. Not only were some denied any access to this new found industrial wealth, most of this wealth accumulated in the hands of a few. This was a time when a small clique of industrialists could commandeer vast fortunes. This was a time that witnessed the ascent of Cornelius Vanderbilt (railroads and shipping), Andrew Carnegie (steel), James Pierpoint Morgan (banking), Leland Stanford (railroads), Meyer Guggenheim (mining and smelting), and John D. Rockefeller (oil). This period saw the rise of the corporate entity and as such corporate entities increased in size, so did their ability to concentrate large sums of money, large sets of resources on a single activity. This squeezed out competition from smaller enterprise competition, and lead to comprehensive, well entrenched, monopoly positions, not only for the corporate entity but even more importantly, for their founders. In many cases, it was the rapid exploitation of some novel process or technology that gave the corporate entity its early edge and then it was a more conventional process of simply squeezing out competition. For example, Andrew Carnegie used the Bessemer method to drive down the cost of steel production, and at the same time drive his competitors out of business. J.P. Morgan took this corporation and turned it into US Steel, an industrial behemoth that enlisted a large workforce to work for a single company, with a single corporate purpose. At that time, a big company was big in every dimension. It had a large scale in terms of capital, workforce, geographic points of presence, buildings and plants. Such a massive and rapid accumulation of wealth had a corrupting influence on legislators and undermined the ability of regulatory bodies to function effectively. The Bosses of the Senate. by J. Ottmann Lith. Co. after Joseph Keppler, Puck (U.S. Senate) The emerging industrial monopolies took many decades to unravel, and many of these names are still with us as large and influential corporate entities. The period could be summed up as 10 years of explosive competition and innovation, followed by 50 years of coming to terms with the resultant oligarchy! Parallels with the Internet What are the parallels with the Internet today? Could we call the current situation the Internet's Gilded Age? Within the Internet itself there are strong parallels, although it's not clear that there has been a single phase of competition followed by agglomeration, but several such phases of competition and agglomeration in various activity sectors over time. As usual, the antecedents of the Internet's trajectory extend back into the world of telephony. The initial introduction of the telephone at the World Exposition of 1876 heralded a rush of investment into this new activity, and telephone companies appeared in rapid order. Most were local in scope, and the concept of a single universal service was completely alien. One stood apart, and the Bell company, and under the direction of Howard Vail and with financing from J. P. Morgan, this company aggressively pursued a path of "One System, One Policy" that directly challenged all other operators, and soon prompted an anti-trust action against the Bell company. The arrangement worked out between Howard Vail and the government (the "Kingsbury Commitment") Bell agreed to divest itself its Western Union telegraph company, leaving the rest of the company in a prime position to further consolidate itself into a massive entrenched monopoly position. Vail saw his company, AT&T, as an enlightened private monopoly undertaking the role of a public utility. In the guise of taking on a commitment to universal service, he was essentially committing to be public interest monopoly that would do no evil, a concept that has been eerily echoed around a century later. At the cost of allowing the most lucrative monopoly in history to flourish, the Kingsbury Commitment enlisted AT&T into a commitment to the goals of a common carriage service in the country. This was an example of another form of public response to the rise of these corporate giants. The conventional position was then, as now, one that took the view that monopolies are unconditionally an intolerable imposition on the proper functioning of society. The notion of "crony capitalism" and the use of money to purchase political power to further corporate aggrandizement is both a historical and a current problem with large entrenched monopolies. The generic public interest response is to break monopolies up and create in their place a more competitive environment that is not so hostile to new entrants, as happened to Standard Oil in 1909 through the Sherman Act. This was also characterized at the time as siding with labor against capital and acting in the interest of the exploited workers. A different view and one that motivated the Kingsbury Commitment was to tolerate the monopoly, but at the same time further empower the state, and use the state's powers to hold these corporate giants to some form of public account. This could be seen as effectively encouraging the monopoly to increase its size even further, but at the same time applying active regulation of the monopoly's actions to enforce them to work for the public good, or at the very least not to erode this public good any further! In AT&T's case the model of universal common service using one system, one policy, and one company resonated strongly with a government that was willing to do a deal. The promise of a universally available telephone service for all businesses and citizens alike, all funded through private investment using a single corporate vehicle sounded like an irresistibly good idea. This is despite the observation that AT&T under Vail's direction, and with J.P. Morgan's financial support, had in fact taken a highly diverse and competitive industry and literally eradicated all competitors and replaced them with a state-sanctioned monopoly that was then literally too big and too critical to let fail. Many other countries were, understandably, not so trusting of their private sector, and the more common model in other countries was a state enterprise that functioned as a regulated monopoly by virtue of its state ownership. By the 1970's the telephone companies were enjoying a form of golden renaissance. The telephone service was largely ubiquitous in the developed world. The completion of digitisation of the underlying network, with the use of time switches and time division multiplexing of the bearer system to complement automated virtual circuit management, allowed the companies to reduce their operating costs with no pressure to reduce their retail prices Being a monopoly meant that there was no competitive market pressure to reduce prices, and being a state enterprise in most cases, the profits were being passed back into the public purse, so that there was no pressure from the state either. Their level of control was close to absolute: they controlled the technology and their suppliers of this technology, the service, the regulatory framework within which they operated. The seeds of their decline were sewn at the same time. The lucrative operating margins created strong political pressure from potential competitors, particularly in the United States, and the successful anti-trust action in 1984 (after earlier unsuccessful attempts in 1948 and 1956) had far reaching implications. The regional Bell Operating Companies were still local monopolies and still enjoyed considerable margins, yet were unable to directly compete with each other, so they looked offshore to new opportunities. In other countries, there was intense lobbying to open their domestic communications activity to competition, as well as selling the incumbent state-owned telephone company. Governments looked at the potential windfall from the sale of the incumbent telco as a means of alleviating some of the burdens of sovereign debt. Such a move would also relieve governments of the cost of further investment of public sector funds into communications infrastructure. It seemed to be a "win-win" proposition for all concerned. The push for deregulation of the sector assumed almost manic proportions in the late 1980's when the international development investment banks also took on this agenda. It reached a point of obvious insanity when Fiji, a small island nation in the middle of the Pacific with less than a million inhabitants, was forced to open its communications sector to competition as the price of further developmental funding from the World Bank. Exactly who benefits from having three competitive service providers in this small isolated island nation is somewhat unclear! The initial response to this global push for structural reform of the telecommunications sector was the rise of the competitive full-service telco, but this was a very tough issue. No-one was going to install a second network of copper wires, so the incumbent was forced to open its networking assets to its competitors by the regulator. Obviously, the newly privatized incumbent saw this as a measure that was hostile to its own revenue base, and the path down deregulation of these full-service copper-based telephone companies was at best tediously slow and dense with obstructionism, lawyers, and protracted legal argument. The second phase of the deregulation of the industry was to be highly selective as to what the competitive service provider would offer. Mobility was introduced in the 1990's, and this was immediately a subject of opportunistic competitive offerings. The scale of investment in infrastructure was remarkably small for mobile services, and the startup times short, so this sector saw the rapid entrance of new competitive providers. There was a second part to this specialization in competition, and that was the offering of these "new" data services, notably the Internet. For the dial-up ISP of the 1990's, the upfront costs were remarkably small. The service was an overlay over the telephone network, so there were no changes there. If they terminated the calls, they could even be paid call termination settlement changes from the telco! The users purchased their own computers and modems, so the investment required to set up such an ISP was slight. The Internet exposed new market opportunity in a market that was actively shedding many regulatory constraints via arbitrage of circuit offerings from the entrenched PTT operator. This encouraged the entrance agile, entrepreneurial capital willing to exploit short-term market opportunities exposed through this form of arbitrage. The incumbent volume-based PTT operators unable to redeploy capital and process to meet new demand, and were unwilling to cannibalize existing markets for their older data products. At the same time, the market for Internet services was moving faster than the incumbent telephone companies could react. As one executive from Bell Canada said in 1996, "The pace of new problems appearing is much faster than our ability to solve any of them." If this was competitive deregulation of the staid old communications industry, then it certainly enjoyed political favor. At this time, the Internet was the poster child for a new wave of service and innovation heralding new digital wealth. The unbundling of the old vertically integrated monopoly was seen to offer specialized competitive opportunities created in every aspect of service delivery, exploring different access technologies, different technical platforms for services (such as, for example, Skype), different ways of delivering content and services. The evident cost efficiencies of digitization of service delivery, as exemplified by the Internet, exposed other markets to searingly intense competition. The collection of vulnerable industries expanded to include newspapers, greeting cards, music, television, and movies, to name but a few. The new digital markets arose that complemented the basic Internet Service Provider's access role. These included digital content providers, web portals and content aggregators, indexing and search engines, sisal networks, and of course advertising. Unbundling of the original vertically integrated full-service model created entirely new sets of industry players, and the resultant waves of euphoria over the past two decades are illustrative of just how broad reaching and disruptive these changes are. But consumers kept wanting more. All these digital services require ever higher access speeds, and consumers see these digital services through a lens of the continuous improvements in price and performance that has been sustained by the computer industry rather than from the experience of the far more static (although far more lucrative) static service model that was the bedrock of the telephone industry it had displaced. This promise of continual refinement of the service, delivering more for less was sustained for a short while through process refinements and minor technology tweaks, but ultimately there came a time where the industry needed to achieve economies of scale of operation, and have sufficient scale within each operator to undertake the massive capital investments in new infrastructure. Small and even mid-sized operators were simply not big enough, as happened a little over a century ago in the Gilded Age. The mantra of the Internet enterprise is simple: "Get Big or Get Bought!" Under-capitalised operators simply were not sustainable, and we saw again the rise of large-scale aggregation and bulking in this industry. The result was much the same as before: a small number of corporate behemoths dominated the Internet and its portfolio of services and content. All others existed essentially at their pleasure and "competition" was once more an exercise in a thin veneer of compliance to outmoded and often irrelevant regulatory structures. For a while it looked like the traditional carriage sector would once more dominate this activity, and while they were no longer state-owned enterprises, the connections between the incumbent large entities and their "home" states still ran deep, and they were still highly influential in the Internet. However, once more this environment changed. For a small period, the content and carriage activities existed in largely separate business domains, tied by mutual interdependence. The task of carriage was to carry users to content, which implied that carriage was essential to content. But at the same time, a client/server Internet bereft of servers is useless, so content is essential to carriage. In a world of re-emerging corporate behemoths, such mutual interdependence is unsettling, both to the actors directly involved and to the larger public interest. The content industry is largely the more lucrative of these two and enjoys far less in the way of regulatory constraint. There is no concept of any universal service obligation or even any effective form of price control in the services they offer. They use internal cross funding that allows them to offer free services to the public, as in free email, free content hosting, free storage, and similar, and fund these services through a second, more occluded, transaction that essentially sells the user's consumer profile to the highest bidding advertiser. All this happens outside of any significant regulatory constraint and has given the content services industry both considerable wealth and considerable commercial latitude. It should be no surprise that this industry is now using its capability and capital to eliminate its former dependence on the carriage sector. We are now seeing the rapid rise of the content data network (CDN) model, where instead of an Internet carrying the user to a diverse set of content stores, the content stores are opening local content outlets right next to the user. As all forms of digital services move into CDN hostels, and as the CDN opens outlets that are positioned immediately adjacent to pools of economically valuable consumers, then where does that leave the traditional carriage role in the Internet? The outlook is not looking all that rosy, and while it may be an early call, it's likely that we've seen the last of the major infrastructure projects being financed by the transit carriers, for the moment at any rate. In many developed Internet consumer markets, there is just no call for end users to access remote services at such massive volumes anymore. Instead, the content providers are moving their mainstream content far closer to the user, and it's the content distribution systems that are taking the leading role in funding any further expansion in the Internet's long-distance infrastructure. For the user that means improved service performance and the potential for lower data costs, particularly when considering the carriage cost component. The demands for long distance transit infrastructure are still there, but now it's a case of the content providers driving the bulk of that demand, and the residual user-driven transit component is becoming an esoteric niche activity that is well outside the mainstream data service. Equally importantly, however, is the observation that these CDNs are essentially private systems, beyond the reach of conventional communications regulatory regimes. They are not based on public communications services, but increasingly use private dark fiber builds, for example. We are witnessing the waning use of a public communications service model that invests predominately in carriage, such that the user is "transported" to the door of the content bunker. Instead, we are using a model that uses private communications facilities to push content and service towards the user, bypassing most of the previous carriage function. In other words, right now it appears that content is in the ascendant and the carriage folk, particularly the area of long-haul transit carriage, are seeing a marked decline in the perceived value of their services. The mutual independence is being dismantled and the new behemoths of the Internet's Gilded Age are now content and service operators. Who are these new barons of today's Gilded Age? Any casual poll would nominate Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft. Apple is current the world's most valuable public company, with a market capitalization of $728B USD. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has a valuation of $591B USD, and Microsoft weighs in a $499B USD. Collectively, these three companies occupy the top three slots of the ordered list of the most valuable public companies. Amazon and Facebook are also listed in the top 10, while AT&T is notable by its absence on this short list. But while there are obvious comparisons between these digital barons of today and their counterparts in the late 19th century, there are also some disturbing differences. Previously these corporate giants were giants in every respect. Not only did they have large volumes of capital and resources, but they also employed large numbers or workers. AT&T peaked with some 1 million employees in the 1960's. US Steel peaked with 340,000 employees. By comparison, Google employs 60,000 people, which is a similar count to that of Apple, while Amazon employs 39,000 individuals, Facebook employ just 17,000 people. Microsoft is by far the largest with 114,000 employees. The obvious change is that these new corporate giants have a far smaller workforce and far shallower social roots. This is an obvious point of concern. These companies have been able to amass massive amounts of capital and encompass relationships with billions of consumers but have done so without reaching deeply into the social fabric of any country. They are in many ways, examples of a virtual corporate entity that exists more in the digital ether, rather than with bricks, mortar, and workers. And, in a similar manner, their taxation bill sometimes appears to also enjoy a similar degree of virtuality. In a regulatory sense, they also enjoy considerable freedom. These are not carriage enterprises and would not normally fall into the communications sector in terms of regulatory oversight. In today's Internet, what do we mean in a policy sense by concepts such as "universal service obligation" "network neutrality" "rights of access" or even "market dominance" when we are talking about diverse CDNs as being the dominant actors in the Internet ecosystem? At some point in the past few years or so the dominant position across the entire Internet has been occupied by a very small number of players who are moving far faster than the regulatory framework. These actors have such market dominance that they can set their own rules of engagement with the consumers of their services their methods of engagement with each other, third party suppliers, regulators and of course governments. By taking up an agile position with these emergent technologies, these players have been able to amass vast fortunes, with little in the way of accountability to a broader common public good. These are today's overreaching oligarchies. The oligarchies of the gilded age were highly persistent. JPMorgan Chase is still among today's top 10 corporates with a market capitalization of $308B USD, as is General Electric ($279B USD), and a by-product of Standard Oil, Exxon Mobil, is also in this exclusive club ($4347B USD). The lesson appears to be that once these corporate monoliths have been created, the effort of curbing their excessive and overbearing influence can take us many decades to dismantle. Why would we even want to do so? Surely this is a time of rapid social enrichment? Like the original Gilded Age aren't we all riding on a rising tide of affluence? It seems not. As in the past, there remains large-scale endemic poverty and massive inequities in our world. As the demands of our post-industrial workforce change, we are seeing increasing numbers of displaced workers. This economy is not based on large unskilled or even skilled workforces, and even the skill sets that are in demand are highly specialized. In the same manner that the industrial age displaced the rural cottage industries, we see another wave of change. But this new world is not for everyone, and it's not that the jobs are in different factories this time. Many of these jobs have simply disappeared, there is an increasing pool of people who are highly reliant on social welfare. But social welfare demands social funding, and we return once more to the observation that these new corporate giants have essentially tiny workforces, and are not deeply rooted in any particular national social fabric. Highly selective corporate philanthropy appears to be a rather poor substitute for conventional corporate taxation. In today's world, there is once more a massive concentration of corporate power. There are fewer public companies, and more are disappearing than appearing while this process of concentration and aggregation is underway. Now corporatism is the new thinking, and any politician that has a desire to curb corporate influence and social power is forced to work with a sparse set of thin regulatory frameworks to advance the cause of the public good. The more common mantra is to surrender the ground to so-called industry self-regulation, and hope that the resultant feeding frenzy does not generate an unpalatable level of collateral damage. There are very few times and very few industries where the private sector has been entirely capable of looking after the public interest. "Do No Evil" is a hopelessly inadequate replacement for the traditionally regulated frameworks that provide our society with essential public services. We now need robust active public regulatory frameworks that can support vibrant industry competition, fundamental innovation and maintain the enduring public value of our Internet. This is no longer just a conversation about carriage and communications. It is probably not even a conversation about carriage and communications at all. The changing face of the Internet is no longer a matter of public communications, but a matter of public services. And with this observation, we are back to a more basic theme. The essential topic of the conversation is how to strike a sustainable balance between a rapacious private sector that has amassed overarching control of the digital service and content space, and the needs of the larger society in which we all would like some equity of opportunity to thrive and benefit from the outcomes of this new digital age.

Loaded words, rapacious and overarching, thrive and benefit. And "we". The essential topic of this conversation is how to protect the liberty of the private sector from the aggressive predations of public regulators. Who is more responsive to the public? Government officials who rule by force or private companies forced to compete for the public dollar? This is a informative and insightful essay, but it operates under the assumption that regulation is necessary because without it, oligarchs can manipulate government, complete with the de rigueur robber baron images. Better to reduce the role and power of governments to address this problem, IMO. Are the Akamais of the world building steelworks to furnish shipwrights who sail ships across the oceans deploying fiber spun out Akamai's glassworks? These CDN monopolies are subject to competition as are the content generators. Do we want public regulation of content to ensure that my personal website is visible enough? The disruptive power of the Internet is a result of lack of regulation and we should recognize and embrace this, we should not look backwards to the ITU and forwards towards "public" (read governmental) regulation to solve a conjectural problem. While there may be real dangers in the accumulation of power into the hands of a few shallowly-rooted (yet publicly owned) companies, let's let the market deal with those dangers in the agile and flexible manner it has displayed over the last 30 (deregulated) years.

The National Weather Service issued the watch for New York City, Long Island, Southern Westchester, Southern New Haven, Southern Fairfield, New London, and Middlesex and New London counties, beginning late Monday through Tuesday evening. The watch means there is a potential for blowing snow and extremely poor visibility, forecasters said. “It’s a big storm coming up the coast,” said Accuweather meteorologist Rob Miller. “And they produce a lot of snow.” The exact path of the “classic Nor’easter” will determine how much snow falls in the city, Miller said. A move to the west as the storm travels up the coast could warm the air and turn some of the precipitation to rain. A shift to the east could push the worst of the snow out to sea. But the computer models used for forecasts point to the city and the surrounding suburbs taking a major wallop, Miller explained. “In the past 24 hours, computer guidance has been remarkably consistent,” he said. The corridor from Washington D.C. up to Boston is likely to take the brunt of the storm, with as much as two feet falling in New England. Storms like this are not unusual in March, Miller said, when warmer air from the south mixes with cold air coming from Canada and across the northern U.S. Snow is likely to begin falling overnight Monday, making a mess of Tuesday’s morning rush hour. Blizzard conditions are likely during the day on Tuesday, with “significant” amount of snow expected, the NWS said. The snow will taper off by evening, but a few snow showers could linger through Wednesday. Major airlines including Delta, American and United have waived fees for passengers who change their flights to avoid the storm. “Winter’s not over,” Miller said.

Donald Trump’s election has rearranged the way technology firms stack up in the capital. Some companies have criticized the president’s policies while others see opportunities to sway the new regime. This will likely play out in a series of corporate legal battles already in the courts. Barack Obama’s administration was close to America’s tech darlings, particularly with Google. Dozens of officials who worked for Democratic White Houses later joined the search engine and vice versa, including former Google Vice President Megan Smith who became the government’s chief technology officer. Facebook’s chief operating officer is a former Clinton Treasury official. Advisory council Mr. Trump called for a boycott of Apple over its encryption battle with the FBI, and initially didn’t name any Silicon Valley leaders to a new CEO advisory council. Mr. Trump later held a meeting with tech chiefs in December. But when Mr. Trump issued a temporary ban on citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, Apple and Google were among the firms that resisted. A revised version was issued on Monday. Some firms, like Oracle, are taking advantage of the new the pecking order. Safra Catz was one of the few tech CEOs to have a private meeting with Mr. Trump. He put her on his transition team. The company sued Google over use of Oracle’s Java software, which Oracle claims is a copyright violation. Oracle representatives in Washington D.C. have noted Google’s close relationship with the Obama regime, while the Podesta Group is among a few consultants no longer working for Google but still counting Oracle as a client, according to people familiar with the matter. Qualcomm is also looking to increase its political spending amid a heated battle with Apple, which is seen as vulnerable in Washington because of its criticisms of Trump policies, lobbyists say. The iPhone maker sued Qualcomm over a patent dispute and $1 billion in withheld payments. The change in administration could help Qualcomm with the Federal Trade Commission, which alleged anti-competitive behaviour just before Mr. Trump took office. Consumers have pressured some enterprises to reduce White House ties. Uber’s Travis Kalanick quit Mr. Trump’s advisory council, for instance. Companies that have less interaction with the general public, like Oracle and Qualcomm, don’t face the same demands. Washington provides them another avenue for battle outside the courtroom.

While this is useful, the menus have always looked pretty bland. A jailbreak tweak called 3DColorChanger10 by gilsharhar7 fixes this problem by offering a myriad of comprehensive customization options that dwarf any tweak in its department. When you install 3DColorChanger10, you’ll find a new preferences pane in the Settings app that arms you with an arsenal of colorization options: All of the options at your fingertips include the following: Toggle the tweak on or off on demand Automatically detect the best color to use based on the app icon itself Enable a border around the menus Choose colors for the background, labels, separators, and border Choose a custom width for the border Choose an alpha level for the menu color For those who don’t like to spend a lot of time configuring settings, the auto detect color method might be the best choice, because this lets the tweak decide the color for you. Those who like going all out with a custom look and feel, on the other hand, are going to feel right at home with all of the custom options, which will apply to every one of your menus, no matter the app. It’s worth noting that all of the settings are applied on the fly without the need to respring, which means you save time and can easily check your results. It’s also worth noting that if you don’t have to have a 3D Touch device, you can still use this tweak by installing a gesture simulator tweak like Peek-a-Boo. This will let you tap and hold on your app icons to bring up these menus, rather than using a firm press, and you’ll still get the colorization effects from 3DColorChanger10. You might also like: This tweak removes the “Share this app” button from your 3D Touch menus If you’re interested in trying 3DColorChanger10, you can download it for $0.99 from Cydia’s BigBoss repository.

Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) Mar 11, 2017 at 11:30AM Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) is trying hard to shed the tag of "Apple supplier". The Cupertino-based smartphone giant accounted for 40% of Skyworks' revenue in the first quarter, but so much reliance on a single customer is risky. That explains why Skyworks management is looking elsewhere to grow the business, and its latest product launch appears to be part of this strategy. Image source: Skyworks Solutions. China will bear fruit Skyworks recently launched the SkyOne Ultra 2.5 front-end LTE solution -- used to process the incoming signal in a connected device -- to tap the Chinese LTE market. The new solution is based on the company's SkyBlue platform, which aims to deliver a longer battery life and better performance. The company claims that this front-end LTE module can be deployed by different smartphone manufacturers according to their needs. This product launch targets China's growing LTE market, which already boasts 762 million subscribers. LTE subscriber growth in the region was 84% last year, well ahead of global growth at 64%. Quite a few Chinese companies -- Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, and Meizu -- are already on its client list, and all of them are using LTE content from Skyworks. In fact, Skyworks expanded its LTE content across all these Chinese manufacturers in the last-reported quarter. Huawei became Skyworks' second-largest customer, as it has been using the SkyBlue platform in its Mate 9 devices.  The company now needs to push more LTE content to these smartphone companies in order to increase its dollar content. This is where the development of new solutions such as the Ultra 2.5 will come into play. Customers will want to deploy better technology in their product offerings, and Skyworks can charge more for upgraded solutions. Chinese manufacturers have been able to raise the prices of their phones, indicating that they are capable of passing the increased cost of components to customers. Canalys estimates that the average selling price of a smartphone in China was $321 in the third quarter of 2016, up from $255 in 2013. The firm expects that the trend of higher average prices of smartphones in China will continue, as manufacturers tilt toward the premium market to improve brand equity. Looking ahead, China will continue driving the adoption of LTE technology. GSMA Intelligence forecasts that developing economies will account for 60% of the estimated 2.5 billion LTE connections by 2020, compared to just 30% in 2014.  Moreover, sales of smartphones from the top 10 Chinese manufacturers are expected to rise 39% in 2017. This should lead to increased near-term demand for Skyworks' components, while LTE adoption will power the company's long-term prospects in China. Image source: Skyworks Solutions. Gaining traction in automotive Skyworks is also targeting automotive and machine-to-machine applications with the Ultra 2.5 chip family. Carlos Bori, the vice president of sales and marketing for Skyworks, says: "We are pleased to broadly offer this flexible system solution in response to growing smartphone demand in China as well as the need for highly integrated solutions across adjacent automotive and machine-to-machine applications." Until last year, Skyworks only had a few contracts in the auto segment. Its deal with LG Electronics to power the infotainment system in the Volkswagen Group's vehicles was the highlight of this business in 2016. LG will use eight Skyworks chips, including front-end modules, to deliver location-based connectivity and other IoT (Internet of Things) applications such as smart-home controls. The LG deal could be a big win for Skyworks, as Volkswagen is the world's largest automaker and is moving swiftly to connect its cars to the internet. The good part is that Skyworks' automotive business seems to be gaining traction. It landed a strategic design win at a "leading U.S. electric car OEM" in the recently concluded quarter. Though Skyworks did not name this particular client, as of now, there is only one company leading the field in electric cars in the U.S. Additionally, Samsung is using Skyworks' automotive solutions to enable remote diagnostics. The Foolish takeaway Skyworks does not break out how much money it gets from the auto segment, but the design wins should eventually boost revenue in the long run. Chinese smartphones, on the other hand, will give the company another avenue to grow its top line and reduce its dependency on Apple. In all, these two markets present long-term opportunities for Skyworks Solutions that investors should not miss. Harsh Chauhan has no position in any stocks mentioned.

CJ Prober pledges to hold the line on costs, make the cameras easier to use and chase international growth. Action-camera maker GoPro has a new COO, CJ Prober, whose promotion followed a year when the company suffered production delays for one product, recalled another and abandoned efforts to turn itself into a media company.   (Randy Risling / Toronto Star) | Order this photo   By Selina WangBloomberg Sat., March 11, 2017 In January, CJ Prober took on a challenge that has become frustratingly common in techdom: turning around a publicly traded hardware company whose products are no longer hits. Prober is GoPro Inc.’s new chief operating officer, a position that had been vacant for about two years. His promotion followed a rocky 2016, during which the action-camera maker suffered production delays for one product, recalled another and abandoned efforts to turn itself into a media company. Sales tanked, GoPro cut its forecast and investors bolted. The rut continued this week when the shares slid to a record low after Goldman Sachs became the second firm in two days to recommend selling the stock. Prober, who joined GoPro in 2014 after holding various positions at Electronic Arts, brings solid accomplishments to the new gig, having already rebuilt his employer’s engineering operations and improved clunky editing software. Article Continued Below Even so, he’ll struggle to revitalize GoPro. The 15-year-old company is trying to grow beyond a niche market of action junkies keen to capture their exploits on video. Much like Fitbit trackers, many GoPro cameras are used a few times and then relegated to the junk drawer. In his first interview since becoming COO, Prober pledged to hold the line on costs, make the cameras easier to use and chase international growth.  “From a product perspective we had an amazing 2016, but from a financial perspective we had a tough 2016,” he said. “So we’re rebuilding on that. There’s a lot of positive momentum behind the changes we’re making.” Like any consumer hardware company, GoPro must regularly upgrade existing products and create new ones to keep shoppers happy. Even big players like Apple, with a deep engineering bench and billions to spend on research and development, struggle to pull that off consistently. For small companies like GoPro, it’s even harder — especially when low-cost competitors from China quickly copy their best product features and the likes of Apple and Samsung keep improving their smartphone cameras. With sales slowing in 2015, chief executive officer Nick Woodman bet on a new drone called Karma and an upgraded version of the popular Hero camera. Trying to rush the new products to market backfired. After the Karma debuted in September, a small number of consumers began complaining that the batteries were failing. Prober says vibrations from the drone’s motors were the culprit. The fix was simple enough. GroPro engineers placed springs inside the battery compartment to stabilize the power cells. But the company was forced to recall the drone, and it took months before the gadget was back in stores. Meanwhile, Chinese drone maker DJI used the time to further consolidate its domination of the market.  The new Hero5 was to be the first update to GoPro’s flagship line of cameras since 2014. It would be the easiest yet to use, feature a touchscreen and let users upload content to the cloud. The Hero5 also would be waterproof, and Prober says that’s where the trouble began. Late in the process, GoPro discovered that pulling this off was harder than anticipated. As a result, the company had a shortage of devices until November. That meant GoPro missed sales during the crucial Christmas shopping and had to pull a number of planned marketing initiatives. Prober, who early in his career worked as a management consultant at McKinsey, partly blames a siloed organization for the unforced errors. He says teams were isolated from one other and focused on a specific agenda rather than working together. Ultimately, he says, the company’s ambitious product pipeline overwhelmed a management team with too many layers and sign-offs. Prober vows to avoid future mishaps with a smaller, flatter organization. Late last year, the company shuttered its entertainment unit and eliminated 15 per cent of its employees, a third of whom were vice presidents or higher.  “A lot of times when you reduce complexity in a business, it helps you make the jobs of teams better,” Prober says. “It’s less stuff to worry about, more clarity.” His mantra for 2017: “Do more with less.” Besides launching a new version of its Hero camera this year, GoPro is expanding its lineup of accessories, including a remote control called the Remo that lets users control the camera with voice commands, and the Karma grip, a handheld camera stabilizer. The aim of the accessories strategy is to make the cameras useful in as many settings as possible and attract new consumers to the GoPro ecosystem. Another big focus is making GoPro cameras easier to use. The gadgets have long been criticized for a clunky user-interface and editing tools. GoPro has tried to make the process of shooting and sharing videos easier, with new mobile and desktop editing products and its new cloud-connected cameras. But to capture users beyond its core base of action enthusiasts, GoPro needs to make that process even simpler. “They’re going to keep on fighting the battle of improving the software,” says Brad Erickson, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities. “I don’t fault GoPro. I think the amount of people in this world willing to sit and edit videos from a purpose-built camera is very low. We all have smartphones that have decently good editing apps.” International expansion is one of the few bright spots for GoPro. Though demand in the U.S. has declined, sales in Asia doubled in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. The company plans to work with local companies to get bigger reach without spending a ton of marketing dollars. Just last month, GoPro partnered with Huawei Technologies Co. to integrate GoPro’s mobile editing app into Huawei’s new P10 smartphones. But GoPro faces stiff competition in places like China, where the market is flooded with cheaper options. Winning back Wall Street will take some doing. When Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski recommended selling the stock on Monday she warned clients that GoPro’s core market is largely saturated and that the company has failed to attract a more mainstream audience. In a note to clients she wrote: “We expect GoPro to continue to struggle fundamentally.”  Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

McIntyre March 11, 2017 9:25 am EDT Print Email Tweet Research firm Drexel Hamilton has released a research note that says Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is “one of the most underappreciated stocks in the world.” Given that it is the world’s most valuable company based on market cap, and one of the world’s two or three most famous brands, the position seems hard to defend. According to a Barron’s post, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White wrote: Last week, the smartphone lost its cachet at Mobile World Congress (MWC) as Samsung Electronics (005930KS) shifted the timing of its traditional Galaxy UNPACKED event until March 29 and overall market growth has slowed. In past years, MWC was focused on the smartphone and Samsung has historically used this venue to introduce its flagship Galaxy “S” phones; however, not this year. That said, new smartphones were unveiled by a host of other smartphone vendors; however, nothing that makes us concerned with Apple in 2017 and especially with the major upgrade we expect with the iPhone “X”. Given the plethora of media reports indicating that Apple could introduce advanced 3D sensing technology with the iPhone “X” this fall, we took another look at Lenovo’s Phab 2 Pro with Google Tango at MWC that we believe offers a taste of what is possible in the world of augmented reality (A/R). We believe the addition of advanced 3D sensing to the iPhone could peak the consumer’s curiosity and drive a strong upgrade cycle. Does that mean the upcoming iPhone is appreciated, but the stock is not? Apple’s shares actually have been very visible. They have advanced more than any other Dow component this year, up 20.1% to $139. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen 5.6% over the same period to 20,903. Apple’s current market cap is $730 billion, well ahead of number two Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) at $596 billion. The “underappreciated” stock’s advance has been driven by an extraordinary amount of market coverage about the features and sales of the new iPhone 8, the most appreciated new consumer electronics product in the world.

It might only be February, but we’ve already got leaks, renders and concepts strongly hinting that it’s going to have an all-glass front display with no buttons and very little bezel. It all sounds lovely, but it’s what’s lying underneath the hood that could make the biggest difference. Apple has long relied on graphics architecture from UK-based firm Imagination Technologies. So, when I.T. announced a brand-new chip tech aimed at improving graphical performance in smartphones, it’s safe to assume that the innovations are going to show up in the next iPhone. Don't Miss: These messaging apps are safe from all of the CIA’s known hacking tools Imagination Technologies has updated its PowerVR Furian architecture, which is likely to feature in the iPhone 8. The new chip has a much higher computational density than its predecessors, which means that the same-sized chip is significantly more powerful. The end result should be much better performance for gaming and graphics-heavy operations. But the biggest improvements could be in AR rather than gaming. Augmented reality is tipped to play a part in the iPhone 8 design, so a more powerful graphics chip capable of processing and rendering AR graphics in real time would make a whole bunch of sense. It could also help utilize the rumored dual-camera system better. The iPhone 7 Plus already uses fancy computational tricks and the dual camera system to take incredible photos, and a similar dual-camera system is rumored for the iPhone 8. With two camera lenses and all sorts of computational power — say, what you’d get from IT’s new chip — the possibilities for what Apple could do AR-wise increase. Tim Cook has made it clear in a series of interviews that Apple very much sees AR as a vital future technology. So far, Apple has not made in a play in the VR or AR industry, but there’s rumored to be a giant secretive project in the works. Apple’s going to need all the tricks it can muster to go toe-to-toe with the new Galaxy S8. Rumors and leaked pics of that phone have shown that it will have a similar no-bezel design, and it’s going to use Qualcomm’s brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor. Samsung’s phone will be in stores by the end of April, and with the iPhone 8 launch likely to happen in the fall, Apple’s going to have a lot of ground to make up.

 Apple's iPhone-destroying robots are 'operating' in California and Europe Kif Leswing Mar. 11, 2017, 9:30 AM 16,797 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple Last spring, Apple introduced a new robot at its spring event, Liam, whose job it is to take apart iPhones so more of the valuable materials inside could be recovered and reused.   Liam "production line" systems are currently operating in California and the Netherlands, Apple said in a report published on February 21. One Liam system can disassemble 1.2 million iPhone 6 units in a year, according to the report. The maximum 2.4 million phones the two systems can take apart per year are a fraction of the 211 million iPhones Apple sold in 2016.  Last spring, Apple said that its robot could take apart one iPhone 6 every 11 seconds. Apple also revealed how much more materials Liam can save over shredding, which is how electronics are commonly destroyed.  "For every 10,000 phones that Liam disassembles, we have the potential to recover 190 kg of aluminum, 80 kg of copper, 0.13 kg of gold, 0.04 kg of platinum group metals, 0.70 kg of silver, 5.5 kg of tin, and 2.4 kg of rare earth elements," Apple wrote.  The report was part of information that Apple provides on an annual basis because of "green bonds" worth $1.5 billion that Apple issued in 2016. Green bonds are intended to make it easier for investors to identify environmentally friendly projects. Apple's debt follows a set of voluntary guidelines called the Green Bond Principles.  Check out Apple's "Liam" video below:   EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

Of the countless worrisome discoveries made possible by the leaked documents, one of the most frightening was the assertion that the CIA is capable of “bypassing” encrypted messaging apps such as Signal and WhatsApp. This detail was widely reported throughout the week, but according to the New York Times, those reports are overblown. Don't Miss: Apple scrambles to patch vulnerabilities revealed in WikiLeaks CIA files The Times reports that following the dump, security researchers used automated tools to search the entire database and couldn’t find a single mention of any popular encrypted messaging apps. That means top messaging apps like WhatsApp, Signal, Wickr and Apple’s own iMessage platform are all safe from the CIA’s prying eyes. Additionally, “the hacking methods described in the documents do not, in fact, include the ability to bypass such encrypted apps.” While a member of the intelligence community might be able to access your WhatsApp by taking control of your phone, the app itself isn’t vulnerable, at least not according to the documents. As the Times surmises, reporters seem to fundamentally misunderstand what these documents actually reveal. End-to-end encryption means that no one can aside from the two participants can access the conversation, including the company that developed the app. The tools that the leaked documents describe focus on “techniques for hacking into individual phones,” which would subsequently give the CIA (or anyone else who hacked your phone) the ability to see anything they want to see. While this is also troublesome, it’s a different story than if the CIA had developed a tool to “bypass” encryption altogether. Instead, it seems to reinforce the idea that encrypted communication is working. Otherwise, why would the CIA be hacking into individual devices rather than massive network of app users? “If anything in the WikiLeaks revelations is a bombshell, it is just how strong these encrypted apps appear to be. Since it doesn’t have a means of easy mass surveillance of such apps, the C.I.A. seems to have had to turn its attention to the harder and often high-risk task of breaking into individual devices one by one.” Had WikiLeaks not willfully deceived the public with tweets about “hacking malware” that could “infest” mobile devices and “bypass” encryption of apps like Signal and Confide, this clarification might not be necessary. But once again, there appears to be a story behind the story being pushed by WikiLeaks. Trending right now: Leak: Can the iPhone 8 compete with a Galaxy S8 that looks like this?

McIntyre March 10, 2017 6:50 am EDT Print Email Tweet The short interest in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) ticked up by 3.4 million shares to 51 million for the period that ended February 28. Based on shares sold short, it ranked 11th among all companies listed on the Nasdaq. Apple’s shares have had an extraordinary run. The stock is up 20% this year to $139, which puts it atop the Dow 30 components in terms of improvement. In the past year it is up 36%. The reasons for the extraordinary run fall mostly into two categories. The first is that Apple’s iPhone sales in the final quarter of last year reached a record, as did the sales of several other Apple products. The company had $78 billion in revenue for the period. In his comments on the quarter, Apple CEO Tim Cook remarked: We’re thrilled to report that our holiday quarter results generated Apple’s highest quarterly revenue ever, and broke multiple records along the way. We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch. Revenue from Services grew strongly over last year, led by record customer activity on the App Store, and we are very excited about the products in our pipeline. Apple’s guidance also was viewed as better than most estimates. The other and perhaps more compelling reason for the increase in the stock price is the launch of the iPhone 8. Unlike recently released iPhones, analysts expect the new version will add a set of extraordinary new features and retake the leadership in cutting-edge smartphone technology. The widely regarded site MacRumors reported: Apple has a major iPhone redesign planned for 2017, with a glass body and edge-to-edge OLED display that includes an integrated Touch ID fingerprint sensor and front-facing camera. The new iPhone may be sold alongside upgraded (but standard) 4.7 and 5.5-inch iPhones. Apple short interest may have ticked up. If earnings from the next quarter rise, and rumors about the iPhone 8 stay strong, that could change. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Douglas A.

But WikiLeaks claims that the data and documents it obtained reveal a broad program to bypass security measures on everyday products. Associated Press   Craig Timberg, Ellen Nakashima and Elizabeth Dwoskin The Washington Post     The latest revelations about the U.S. government's powerful hacking tools potentially take surveillance right into the homes and hip pockets of billions of technology users worldwide, showing how a remarkable variety of everyday devices can be turned to spy on their owners. Televisions, smartphones and even anti-virus software are all vulnerable to CIA hacking, according to WikiLeaks documents released Tuesday. The capabilities described include recording the sounds, images and private text messages of users, even when they resort to encrypted apps to communicate. While many of the attack technologies had been previously discussed at cybersecurity conferences, experts were startled to see evidence that the CIA had turned so many theoretical vulnerabilities into functioning attack tools against staples of modern life. These include widely used Internet routers, smartphones, and Mac and Windows computers. In the case of a tool called "Weeping Angel" for attacking Samsung smart TVs, WikiLeaks wrote, "After infestation, Weeping Angel places the target TV in a 'Fake-Off' mode, so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on. In 'Fake-Off' mode the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server." The CIA reportedly also has studied whether it could infect vehicle control systems for cars and trucks, which WikiLeaks alleged could be used to conduct "nearly undetectable assassinations." And a specialized CIA unit called the Mobile Devices Branch produced malware to control and steal information from iPhones, which according to WikiLeaks were a particular focus because of the smartphone's popularity "among social, political, diplomatic and business elites." The agency also targeted popular phones running Google's Android, the world's leading mobile operating system. WikiLeaks said it redacted lists of CIA surveillance targets, though it said they included targets and machines in Latin America, Europe and the United States. The anti-secrecy group also said that by developing such intrusive technology - rather than helping tech companies patch flaws in their products - the CIA was undermining efforts to protect the cybersecurity of Americans. "The argument that there is some terrorist using a Samsung TV somewhere - as a reason to not disclose that vulnerability to the company, when it puts thousands of Americans at risk - I fundamentally disagree with it," said Alex Rice, chief technology officer for HackerOne, a startup that enlists hackers to report security gaps to companies and organizations in exchange for cash. The trove released Tuesday, which The Washington Post could not independently verify and the CIA has declined to confirm, included 8,761 documents - the first batch in a series of planned releases, WikiLeaks said. This first group, at least, has important differences from the 2013 revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. His trove of documents largely described mass surveillance of Internet-based communications systems, while the WikiLeaks release more often describes attacks on individual devices. By targeting devices, the CIA reportedly gains access to even well-encrypted communications on such popular apps as Signal and WhatsApp, without having to crack the encryption itself. The WikiLeaks reports acknowledged that difference by saying that the CIA had found ways to "bypass," as opposed to defeat, encryption technologies. "The idea that the CIA and NSA can hack into devices is kind of old news," said Johns Hopkins University cryptography expert Matthew Green. "Anyone who thought they couldn't was living in a fantasy world." Snowden's revelations and the resulting backlash made strong encryption a major, well-funded cause for privacy advocates and, perhaps more important, technology companies that had the engineering expertise and budgets to protect data as it flowed across the world. Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Yahoo and many other companies announced significant new initiatives, in part to protect their brands against accusations by some users that they had made it too easy for the NSA to collect information from their systems. Many websites, meanwhile, began encrypting their data flows to users to prevent snooping. Encryption tools such as Tor were strengthened. Encrypting apps for private messaging, such as Signal, Telegram and WhatsApp, exploded in popularity, especially among users around the world who were fearful of government intrusion. In the days after the U.S. presidential election last fall, Signal was among the most downloaded programs in Apple's app store, and downloads grew by more than 300 percent. Open Whisper Systems, which developed Signal, released a statement Tuesday saying, "The CIA/Wikileaks story today is about getting malware onto phones, none of the exploits are in Signal or break Signal Protocol encryption." WhatsApp declined to comment, and Telegram did not respond to requests for comment. Google declined to comment, while Samsung did not respond to requests for comment. "Apple is deeply committed to safeguarding our customers' privacy and security. The technology built into today's iPhone represents the best data security available to consumers, and we're constantly working to keep it that way," Apple spokesman Fred Sainz said Tuesday in a statement. "While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities. We always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates." U.S. government authorities had complained loudly that the post-Snowden wave of encryption was undermining their ability to investigate serious crimes, such as terrorism and child pornography. The FBI in 2016 sued Apple in hopes of forcing it to unlock an iPhone used by the San Bernadino, California, killers before announcing, amid heavy public criticism, that it had other ways to crack the device. Against that backdrop, many privacy advocates argued that devices - often called "endpoints" for their place in chains of communications that can criss-cross continents - were the best available targets in a world with widespread online encryption. The WikiLeaks documents suggest that the CIA may have reached the same conclusion. "It would certainly be consistent with the hypothesis that we've made real progress in the encryption we've been introducing," said Peter Eckersley, technology projects director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a San Francisco-based civil liberties group. "It's impossible to be 100 percent certain, but reading the tea leaves, it's plausible." The WikiLeaks revelations also serve as a reminder that, whatever the political backlash to revelations about digital spying, it is not going away and probably will continue to grow. Aside from the United States, many other advanced nations such as China, Russia, Britain and Israel have extremely sophisticated tools for digital spying. Less-advanced nations have gained access to powerful online spying technology through a robust and lightly regulated industry of surveillance contractors throughout the world. On Tuesday, resignation and frustration rippled through Silicon Valley as technologists grappled with the revelations of yet another U.S. government attempt to exploit their systems. And cybersecurity experts reacted with alarm. "This is explosive," said Jake Williams, founder of Rendition InfoSec, a cybersecurity firm. The material highlights specific anti-virus products that can be defeated, going further than a release of NSA hacking tools last year, he said. The WikiLeaks release revealed that the CIA has sophisticated "stealth" capabilities that enable hackers not only to infiltrate systems but to evade detection, as well as abilities to move inside a system freely as if they owned it. Nicholas Weaver, a computer security researcher at the University of California at Berkeley, said the dates in the WikiLeaks files suggest that the documents were taken in February or March 2016. At least two of them are marked top secret, "which suggests that somebody in early 2016 managed to compromise a top-secret CIA development system and is willing to say that they did." One internal CIA document listed a set of Apple iPhone "exploits" - tools that can be used to compromise the device by taking advantage of software flaws. Some of the tools are based on "zero days," which are software vulnerabilities that have not been shared with the manufacturer. So "some of these descriptions will allow Apple to fix the vulnerabilities," Weaver said. "But at the same time, they're out in the public, and whoever stole this data could use them against U.S. interests."

Baig 5 days ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL 9 things that crush the value of your home The Russian oligarchs buying up the world © Provided by USA Today What will it take to get you jazzed about smartphones again? The industry appears mostly stuck in neutral, as was evident at the Mobile World Congress trade show that took place in Barcelona, Spain, last week. There was a me-too-ness to most of the handsets on display, and it’s been this way for a while. Can you spell I.N.C.R.E.M.E.N.T.A.L? Popular Searches Adobe Systems Inc ADBE ▲ 122.35 +0.24 +0.20% Intel Corp INTC ▲ 35.14 +0.04 +0.11% Verizon Communications Inc VZ ▼ 50.04 -0.10 -0.20% CBS Corp CBS.A ▼ 68.63 -0.42 -0.61% It was equally telling that one of the biggest stories to come out of MWC was about the relaunch of the Nokia 3310, a cheap compact throwback phone that debuted around the turn of century. It isn’t even slated for the U.S. market. Nor did it help that the two most high profile players on the global smartphone stage, Apple and Samsung, are holding their next big devices for another day— the latter’s Galaxy S8 is slated to be unveiled this month, with the tenth anniversary iPhone most likely arriving in September. There’s another key factor in play though: the phone in your pocket is already pretty-darn capable, which is why so many of you are hanging onto devices that much longer. Of course, it’s not like there’s been zero progress of late. Numerous handsets boast superior screens, improved cameras, zippier processors, fast wireless charging and batteries that squeeze out a little extra juice. We shouldn’t minimize this. Even modestly priced devices can typically deliver more than we ask of them. While there may be an innovation hiatus, “let’s not forget this is still a 1.5 billion-unit market—it’s the most prolific consumer electronics device on the planet, it’s a multibillion business,” says Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight in the U.K. “Only a foolhardy person would write it off.” Google’s Hiroshi Lockheimer certainly isn’t writing it off. “What you can do with your phone continues to evolve, because it’s not just the hardware, it’s the software on top and the services,” Lockheimer says. You expect him to say such a thing as the Google executive in charge of Android, Chrome OS and Google Play. But Lockheimer is right on, of course. We increasingly rely on the phones to entertain us, shoot pictures and videos, pay for stuff at retail, even make the occasional call. So what might get you excited again? Here’s what to keep your eyes and ears on:© Provided by USA Today *Voice. Obviously, this rodeo has begun. The spread of voice capable AI-infused digital assistants represents one key driver to where innovation is going. Google has now unleashed the constantly improving Google Assistant across the Android ecosystem, not just on the company’s own Pixel phones. Amazon’s Alexa is just starting to make it onto handsets, the first being the Mate 9 from China’s Huawei. Google and Amazon are only pressuring Siri—a long time presence on the iPhone—to improve. And let’s not discount another veteran voice, Cortana from Microsoft. Such assistants may soon be joined by another vocal newbie: If the rumors prove to be true, Samsung’s Galaxy S8 will feature a smart, loquacious assistant named Bixby, perhaps based in part on AI technology from Viv Labs, a company Samsung bought last year from the humans behind Siri.© Provided by USA Today *Displays. We’ve seen how Samsung has pushed curved screens through recent iterations of its S-series flagship devices, not to mention on the ill-fated Note 7, and use those edge displays to surface additional information. The LG G6 flagship that was unveiled in Barcelona is almost all screen, given its extremely thin bezels. LG is also relying on an unconventional 18:9 screen ratio (as compared to the more typical 16:9) to help fit a larger display onto a smaller form factor. In any case, going bezel-less (or at least bezel-lite) may become the new normal. Rumors are we’ll see something similar on the Galaxy S8. The next iPhone may also be near edge-to-edge, perhaps with a Touch ID fingerprint sensor and home button embedded directly into what may be a flexible OLED display.© Provided by USA Today *Augmented reality: There’s also a great deal of speculation that the new iPhone will be ready for some form of augmented reality, and possibly through 3D camera technology, facial recognition. CEO Tim Cook hasn’t been shy about Apple’s interest in AR, and analyst Gene Munster of Loup Ventures recently speculated that if the next iPhone integrates a dedicated 3D mapping chip as expected, it could be the first AR hardware to gain mass adoption, which he defines as selling more than 100 million units in a year. It’s still very early days for Google’s Project Tango, though partner Lenovo introduced the Phab 2 Pro based on this AR-based technology—you look through the screen to see objects overlaid on top of the real world—last August. Tango employs computer vision to help devices understand their position relative to their physical surroundings.© Provided by USA Today Asus has showcased a second Tango phone called Zenfone AR, which is also compatible with Google’s Daydream virtual reality headset, a rival to Samsung’s Gear VR. Indeed, virtual reality is already happening, at least when you pair a compatible phone with a Daydream or Gear VR. Is a 3-D hologram phone far behind? *Going modular: LG has already backed off an area it pushed hard a year ago, notably a modular approach to phone design. At the push of a button, G5 owners were able to slide modular components onto the phone to supply a better camera or superior speaker. It was apparently a bust; the new G6 doesn’t accommodate such modules. More bad news for the modular approach? Late last summer, Google shelved its own Project Ara modular phone project, at least for now, with no such phones ever making it to market. “It’s done wonders for us because it has helped position us and the brand in particular as an innovative differentiated brand in a sea of lookalike products,” says Aymar de Lencquesaing, the mobile business group chairman & president at Motorola. “We think with Mods we’re only scratching the surface.” The company says it is selling one Mod for every two Moto Z phones sold. Motorola is committed to launching four modules per quarter on its own, but has also opened up the Mods to about 300 outside developers. At MWC, the company showed off a Mod that turns the phone into an Amazon Echo-like speaker with Alexa, as well as one that doubles as a Nintendo-like mobile gamepad. *True wireless charging: Wireless charging as we know it today involves slapping a compatible phone down on a wireless charging pad or mat that itself is connected to a power source. Yep, there’s a wire involved under this otherwise wireless scenario. Efforts are underway to charge devices in a truly untethered manner, through the air, similar to how we receive Wi-Fi signals. Disney Research scientists built a room that can charge your devices when you walk in. Companies such as Ossia and Energous, the latter rumored to be an Apple partner, have also been working on charging-at-a-distance technology. Apple itself has been a latecomer to conventional wireless charging, something I’d expect to come to the next iPhone. Whether it will involve a charging pad or something cooler and more out there is something we’ll have to wait and see. 5G: There’s a ton of hype around the lightning-fast next generation of Internet connectivity known as 5G, which in terms of smartphones will translate to speeds of at least 1-gigabit per second, with a latency of under 10ms. Though companies like China’s ZTE bragged about having the world’s first Gigabit phone during MWC, it’s merely a prototype at this stage, with no official launch date. 5G trials are already taking place, however, and zippier phones are indeed promised sooner than later. Still, the best guess is that true 5G handsets won’t achieve mainstream status until the early 2020s. Here’s hoping smartphones will become cool again, long before then.

According to a khaleejtimes.com report, citing Arabic daily Emarat Al Youm, the UAE’s Ministry of Economy stated that only specific iPhone 6s which contain defective batteries made in China during September and October 2015 will be recalled. Apple has recently expressed that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. If you have experienced this issue, the firm has urged residents to use the serial number checker (www.apple.com/ae/support/iPhone6s-unexpectedshutdown/) if your iPhone 6s is eligible for a battery replacement, free of charge.

Since then, Microsoft has added a new virtual agent to its website, which attempts to be an initial avenue of support before customers talk to a real person. Microsoft Tech Support Overall Web Score Phone Score Avg Call Time Phone Number Web Support 82/100 48/60 34/40 21:20 800-936-3500 Link Phone Hours (ET): 24/7 One characteristic that separates Microsoft from some of its competitors is its willingness to tackle both hardware and OS problems. Many original equipment manufacturers refuse to answer Windows 10 questions, but because Microsoft makes the operating system, its company reps are happy to talk about it. To test Microsoft's support prowess, I used a Surface Book and asked three different questions across three channels: phone, web and social media: how to change the Surface Pen to left-handed mode, how to change what the pen buttons do and how to stop my computer from asking for a password when it wakes from sleep. Web and Social First up was social media. There are two main places where Surface Pro and Surface Book owners can contact the company’s support team via social media: Microsoft's @SurfaceSupport Twitter account, and Microsoft's verified Surface page on Facebook. There is a more general Facebook page for Microsoft as a whole, but you can't send the company direct messages there.  The @SurfaceSupport team on Twitter was fairly responsive when answering my question about switching the Surface Pen to left-handed mode. The company replied in less than 3 hours with a succinct, two-part tweet featuring accurate and easy-to-follow instructions. While it wasn't the lighting-fast 15-minute response time we got in 2015/2016, in our eyes, the relatively quick turnaround and simple instructions were more than sufficient. On Facebook, I sent the Surface team a question over Messenger asking how to change what the Surface Pen buttons do at 3:30 p.m. ET. After waiting nearly 24 hours, I sent a second message, and a few hours later, the company sent me a link to a post on Windows Central (a site that isn't affiliated with Microsoft) with pertinent instructions on how to resolve our issue. In the end, we got our answers, but the bigger kudos should probably go to Windows Central for helping Microsoft's support do its job. Web and Chat Support If you prefer to solve tech issues by going straight to the source, you can always head over to Microsoft.com and click the big Support tab at the top of the page. This will bring you to a page where you can search for answers for Microsoft's ever-growing portfolio of products. However, using this tool, I found an answer to only one of my questions pertaining to changing the Surface Pen button actions. Moreover, Microsoft’s AI was unable to answer any of my three test questions, no matter how many times I rephrased the queries. Often, the virtual agent would respond with topics that were somewhat related but not actually helpful in resolving my issue. Thankfully, right or wrong, every response from the AI was also accompanied by a link asking if I wanted to talk to a real person, which made it quite easy to transition from automated to live support. After clicking the link to switch to live support, I was instantly connected to a tech support rep named Moumon P., located in the Philippines. Moumon then proceeded to check out my earlier query to the virtual assistant. He attempted to answer my question about turning off the password login screen after coming back from the screensaver. The first thing Moumon did was ask if he could access my computer remotely. After I declined, he paused for 5 minutes to look up an answer before providing me with a quick set of instructions, which was missing a critical step. After I described my difficulties, Moumon sent me a more detailed procedure that put me on the right track, and after a few short minutes, I was able to turn off the nagging password login without a problem. The chat took 20 minutes in total. Phone Support There are two ways to contact Microsoft support: filling out a web form to get a call back, or dialing Sales and Partner Information at 800-936-3500. After I called the 800 number, I was connected to a rep named Dayvis, also in the Philippines. I asked Dayvis how to disable the password prompt from appearing when my computer wakes up. After taking over my desktop, he almost nailed it right away by opening the Windows 10 settings menu and navigating to the Lock-Screen Options menu. Unfortunately, from there, he opened the Screen Timeout Settings instead of the Screensaver Settings, leading to a dead end. Next, Dayvis started over from the beginning, and after a couple more minutes of trying various options, he found his way back to the screensaver settings. It could have ended there, but instead, when the computer would not go to sleep (because of the remote access software he was running), he decided to perform a series of unrelated and unhelpful tasks, including turning on system-wide BitLocker encryption, disabling password sign-on for all user accounts and changing what the power button does. After 45 minutes, I suggested that the remote-access software could be the problem, and after he logged off of my Surface Book, the system did go to sleep. After that mess, my second call went much more smoothly. This time, I went through Microsoft's support page, filled out important info, and provided my phone number and a quick description about what kind of problem I was having. (This time, I was looking to set the Surface Pen to left-handed mode.) A robot dialer called me back almost immediately, though I had to wait 6 minutes for a rep, named Ivy, to pick up. Though I denied her request to log in to my machine, it took almost no time for her to talk me through the steps to find the correct settings, and within 11 minutes from the start of the call, we were done. For my third and final call, I went through Microsoft's support website during the evening. Once again, I was called back immediately, but this time, I didn't have wait to be connected to a support agent. After confirming my problem, he expertly instructed me to search for the Surface app in the search box, and helped me find where I needed to go to adjust which apps get opened when I press buttons on my Surface Pen. Then, he ran through the steps again just to make sure I knew the proper steps, and in less than 10 minutes, the call was over. Warranty For U.S. buyers, Microsoft’s products come with a standard one-year warranty that includes tech support and covers the costs for return shipping in the case of a broken or defective part. Customers can also purchase additional coverage, including 1-on-1 training and accidental damage protection, through Microsoft Complete ($149), which covers your device from things like drops or spills for two years from the date of purchase. However, because the Surface Pro and the Surface Book are not designed to be serviced by customers, you will void your warranty if you replace parts, such as the solid-state drive. Bottom Line Although my 45-minute call wasn't the best experience and raised Microsoft's average call time from 15:30 in 2016 to 21:20 in 2017, every time I reached out to Microsoft for support, the company's support representative came back with correct answers. And when I talked with support agents in real time, most even went so far as to run through the steps multiple times to make sure things were all set, even though that did end up causing issues during my first call. The new virtual assistant is a nice idea, but its inability to recognize questions and come back with relevant solutions makes it relatively useless. Overall, Microsoft's Twitter, web and phone support channels will benefit the company’s customers, as support reps there delivered accurate responses every time we tested them. And if Microsoft can continue to expand its services and improve its virtual assistant, there's a clear path for even better support in the future.   Tech Support Showdown Scorecard and Winners Acer Apple Asus Dell HP  Lenovo Microsoft MSI Razer Samsung Author Bio Sam Rutherford, Sam is a former penguin trainer and archery instructor who dabbles in esports and has lived on three different continents.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming Huawei GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: Nintendo Switch Nokia 3310 iPhone 7 Galaxy S8 LG G6 iPhone 8 Home / News / Mobile App News / Microsoft takes on Siri with major update to Cortana for iPhone Microsoft takes on Siri with major update to Cortana for iPhone by Sean Keach 11 March 2017 0 shares Read Comments Digital assistants have come a long way since Clippy the Paperclip, but there’s still plenty of room for improvement. That explains why Microsoft has just released a major overhaul of its Cortana app for iPhone, in a bid to kick Apple’s own Siri software to the curb. The update makes the app much more simple, making it more likely to woo disenfranchised Siri users. For a start, the new app loads much faster, and will begin listening for your voice immediately. So as soon as it’s open, you can start speaking, asking questions, or issuing commands. There’s also a dedicated home-screen that displays carded information. For instance, it’ll show you recommended news (with an option to search for more via Bing, obviously), as well as information about flights or deliveries, yanked from your e-mails. It’s a bit like Android’s Google Now. You can also perform a number of actions from the Cortana app, including sending e-mails, setting alarms and reminders, and checking the weather. Unfortunately, Cortana will always be hampered by Apple’s restrictive iOS software, which means you can’t activate her voice controls outside of the app. That’s in contrast to Siri, which can be activated from basically anywhere, and is has functions that are integrated into a bunch of other Apple services natively. Still, Apple’s Siri is seen as being one of the weaker smartphone-based artificial intelligence, so some iOS users will be pleased that a major alternative is now much better.

Baig 5 days ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL World's first fluorescent frog discovered Newlyweds and family all killed in horror crash on wedding day © Provided by USA Today What will it take to get you jazzed about smartphones again? The industry appears mostly stuck in neutral, as was evident at the Mobile World Congress trade show that took place in Barcelona, Spain, last week. There was a me-too-ness to most of the handsets on display, and it’s been this way for a while. Can you spell I.N.C.R.E.M.E.N.T.A.L? It was equally telling that one of the biggest stories to come out of MWC was about the relaunch of the Nokia 3310, a cheap compact throwback phone that debuted around the turn of century. It isn’t even slated for the U.S. market. Nor did it help that the two most high profile players on the global smartphone stage, Apple and Samsung, are holding their next big devices for another day— the latter’s Galaxy S8 is slated to be unveiled this month, with the tenth anniversary iPhone most likely arriving in September. There’s another key factor in play though: the phone in your pocket is already pretty-darn capable, which is why so many of you are hanging onto devices that much longer. Of course, it’s not like there’s been zero progress of late. Numerous handsets boast superior screens, improved cameras, zippier processors, fast wireless charging and batteries that squeeze out a little extra juice. We shouldn’t minimize this. Even modestly priced devices can typically deliver more than we ask of them. While there may be an innovation hiatus, “let’s not forget this is still a 1.5 billion-unit market—it’s the most prolific consumer electronics device on the planet, it’s a multibillion business,” says Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight in the U.K. “Only a foolhardy person would write it off.” Google’s Hiroshi Lockheimer certainly isn’t writing it off. “What you can do with your phone continues to evolve, because it’s not just the hardware, it’s the software on top and the services,” Lockheimer says. You expect him to say such a thing as the Google executive in charge of Android, Chrome OS and Google Play. But Lockheimer is right on, of course. We increasingly rely on the phones to entertain us, shoot pictures and videos, pay for stuff at retail, even make the occasional call. So what might get you excited again? Here’s what to keep your eyes and ears on: © Provided by USA Today *Voice. Obviously, this rodeo has begun. The spread of voice capable AI-infused digital assistants represents one key driver to where innovation is going. Google has now unleashed the constantly improving Google Assistant across the Android ecosystem, not just on the company’s own Pixel phones. Amazon’s Alexa is just starting to make it onto handsets, the first being the Mate 9 from China’s Huawei. Google and Amazon are only pressuring Siri—a long time presence on the iPhone—to improve. And let’s not discount another veteran voice, Cortana from Microsoft. Such assistants may soon be joined by another vocal newbie: If the rumors prove to be true, Samsung’s Galaxy S8 will feature a smart, loquacious assistant named Bixby, perhaps based in part on AI technology from Viv Labs, a company Samsung bought last year from the humans behind Siri. © Provided by USA Today *Displays. We’ve seen how Samsung has pushed curved screens through recent iterations of its S-series flagship devices, not to mention on the ill-fated Note 7, and use those edge displays to surface additional information. The LG G6 flagship that was unveiled in Barcelona is almost all screen, given its extremely thin bezels. LG is also relying on an unconventional 18:9 screen ratio (as compared to the more typical 16:9) to help fit a larger display onto a smaller form factor. In any case, going bezel-less (or at least bezel-lite) may become the new normal. Rumors are we’ll see something similar on the Galaxy S8. The next iPhone may also be near edge-to-edge, perhaps with a Touch ID fingerprint sensor and home button embedded directly into what may be a flexible OLED display. © Provided by USA Today *Augmented reality: There’s also a great deal of speculation that the new iPhone will be ready for some form of augmented reality, and possibly through 3D camera technology, facial recognition. CEO Tim Cook hasn’t been shy about Apple’s interest in AR, and analyst Gene Munster of Loup Ventures recently speculated that if the next iPhone integrates a dedicated 3D mapping chip as expected, it could be the first AR hardware to gain mass adoption, which he defines as selling more than 100 million units in a year. It’s still very early days for Google’s Project Tango, though partner Lenovo introduced the Phab 2 Pro based on this AR-based technology—you look through the screen to see objects overlaid on top of the real world—last August. Tango employs computer vision to help devices understand their position relative to their physical surroundings. © Provided by USA Today Asus has showcased a second Tango phone called Zenfone AR, which is also compatible with Google’s Daydream virtual reality headset, a rival to Samsung’s Gear VR. Indeed, virtual reality is already happening, at least when you pair a compatible phone with a Daydream or Gear VR. Is a 3-D hologram phone far behind? *Going modular: LG has already backed off an area it pushed hard a year ago, notably a modular approach to phone design. At the push of a button, G5 owners were able to slide modular components onto the phone to supply a better camera or superior speaker. It was apparently a bust; the new G6 doesn’t accommodate such modules. More bad news for the modular approach? Late last summer, Google shelved its own Project Ara modular phone project, at least for now, with no such phones ever making it to market. “It’s done wonders for us because it has helped position us and the brand in particular as an innovative differentiated brand in a sea of lookalike products,” says Aymar de Lencquesaing, the mobile business group chairman & president at Motorola. “We think with Mods we’re only scratching the surface.” The company says it is selling one Mod for every two Moto Z phones sold. Motorola is committed to launching four modules per quarter on its own, but has also opened up the Mods to about 300 outside developers. At MWC, the company showed off a Mod that turns the phone into an Amazon Echo-like speaker with Alexa, as well as one that doubles as a Nintendo-like mobile gamepad. *True wireless charging: Wireless charging as we know it today involves slapping a compatible phone down on a wireless charging pad or mat that itself is connected to a power source. Yep, there’s a wire involved under this otherwise wireless scenario. Efforts are underway to charge devices in a truly untethered manner, through the air, similar to how we receive Wi-Fi signals. Disney Research scientists built a room that can charge your devices when you walk in. Companies such as Ossia and Energous, the latter rumored to be an Apple partner, have also been working on charging-at-a-distance technology. Apple itself has been a latecomer to conventional wireless charging, something I’d expect to come to the next iPhone. Whether it will involve a charging pad or something cooler and more out there is something we’ll have to wait and see. 5G: There’s a ton of hype around the lightning-fast next generation of Internet connectivity known as 5G, which in terms of smartphones will translate to speeds of at least 1-gigabit per second, with a latency of under 10ms. Though companies like China’s ZTE bragged about having the world’s first Gigabit phone during MWC, it’s merely a prototype at this stage, with no official launch date. 5G trials are already taking place, however, and zippier phones are indeed promised sooner than later. Still, the best guess is that true 5G handsets won’t achieve mainstream status until the early 2020s. Here’s hoping smartphones will become cool again, long before then.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley: Water vote looms after Council's approval of special election Friday Mar 10, 2017 at 12:01 AM Mar 10, 2017 at 11:14 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — The Town Council on Thursday voted 4-0 to order a special election that will decide the future of its acquisition attempt of Liberty Utilities’ water system. Approval came after a two-hour meeting during which Councilman Larry Cusack recused himself from the vote — his company does business with Liberty — and nearly 20 residents weighed in on water rates; election costs and voter turnout; and the effect the contentious issue has had on the community. At stake in the June 6 election will be whether the town can incur a maximum amount of $150 million in debt to finance a purchase of the water system — should its right to take the system be granted in court. According to town documents, the debt must be repaid from revenues generated by the water system — not from taxes — and the town must conduct an annual independent audit. Comments from residents varied prior to the vote. Those in favor of acquisition spoke of “skyrocketing” water rates and the effect those rates have on the real estate market. Bob Benson, a commercial real estate broker, told the Council he’s generally not a fan of government taking over private businesses, but added the situation in Apple Valley is different. “We have no choice,” Benson said. “My partner and I spend every day analyzing apartments throughout the whole High Desert. There are no exceptions. When you’re analyzing the expenses of an apartment complex and Liberty … the expenses are always higher … When those expenses go up, the value of that property goes down.” Other residents in favor of acquisition told stories of removed lawns, brown grass at local parks and a decades-long “cycle” in which Liberty has urged conservation only to raise rates or issue surcharges to recoup lost revenue. Meanwhile, residents opposed to acquisition questioned the town’s motives in holding an off-year election, contending the town was banking on the measure passing as a result of low voter turnout. Last November, voters passed Measure V with 67 percent of the vote, thus forcing an election on the revenue-bond debt. Town resident Pat Hanson — one of Measure V’s proponents — viewed the special election as hastily ordered. “What a surprise when I opened the paper this morning and saw there was a meeting called to discuss Measure V,” Hanson said. “You’re prepared to issue a request for a bond issue when you don’t have the full Council present. Is this issue so urgent that Mr. Nassif cannot return before you present it to us?” Mayor Scott Nassif was in Orlando, Florida during Thursday’s meeting; however, he participated via teleconference. Other residents wondered why the Council would call for an election that might grant financing for the water system when the town does not yet have the right to take it. A right-to-take trial date in the town’s eminent domain action against Liberty remains unset. A trial-setting conference is scheduled for April 28 in San Bernardino County Superior Court. Prior to Measure V’s passage, the Town Council relied primarily on surveys and campaign promises they said got them re-elected to gauge support for acquisition. Town spokeswoman Kathie Martin previously said she could not speculate whether the town would have put acquisition to a vote had Measure V not passed; however, she added votes are not required when revenue bonds are used to finance a purchase. During Thursday’s meeting — despite fighting Measure V with an alternative measure — the Town Council expressed support for residents’ right to weigh in on the issue. Perhaps the most impassioned comments came from Councilman Curt Emick, who touted local control of a municipally run system while arguing that the California Public Utilities Commission — who sets Liberty’s rates — doesn’t understand the needs of the High Desert. “This is something that’s going to affect your life,” Emick said. “This isn’t a Super Bowl game where who cares after the game’s over who won or lost. The fact is this is you, this is your family, this is right here in Apple Valley. And what happens here — like what happens in Victorville or any other city around us — is going to affect us all.” The special election will cost the town $222,000, town documents show. Additional 4-0 Council votes set deadlines for arguments both for and against the measure and directed the town attorney to prepare an impartial analysis.

RUSSO - 3/11/17 1:09 AM NEW YORK — After years of coming up short of the conference tournament title game in New York City as a member of the Big East, Notre Dame will finally get a chance to play for a championship in the Big Apple. Steve Vasturia and Bonzie Colson each scored 18 points and No. 22 Notre Dame knocked off No. 16 Florida State 77-73 on Friday night to advance to the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament title game for the second time in three years. The third-seeded Fighting Irish (25-8) will face fifth-seeded and No. 14 Duke on Saturday night at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, trying to make it two ACC titles in four seasons as a member of the conference. In 18 years playing in the Big East, the Fighting Irish never did reach the tournament title game at Madison Square Garden. “I like this building way more because my record in Barclays is way better than the Garden,” Notre Dame coach Mike Brey said. The Fighting Irish won two NCAA Tournament games at Barclays last year and two more in November at the Legends Classic. “We were fortunate enough to play in the semis in the Garden, we never got to the Saturday night,” Brey said. “And it was electric. I thought tonight was really good. Both arenas I think are on par. We’ll probably be in that arena someday. I don’t know if I’ll still be coaching when we get there, but we’ll be in that arena someday too.” Notre Dame has eliminated Duke from the tournament each of the past two seasons, including a semifinal victory in 2015 on the way to the Irish’s first conference tournament championship. That team was led by a strong core of upperclassmen such as Jerian Grant, Pat Connaughton and Zach Auguste. Vasturia, Colson, Matt Farrell (15 points) and VJ Beachem (six points and seven rebounds) were the young guys back then. Now they are Notre Dame’s core four. “You know, it shows up in poise,” Brey said. “It shows up in outstanding leadership. It shows up in great stability in times of taking punches in a league like ours, which we did.” Dwayne Bacon led Florida State (25-8) with 18 points. The Irish and Seminoles had a tough act to follow after Duke and North Carolina had the sellout crowd of 18,109 rocking in Brooklyn. Many fans dressed in blue bailed on the nightcap. Not New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was back at Barclays for a second straight night, sitting behind the Notre Dame bench rooting on his buddy, Brey. Notre Dame eliminated most of the drama with a 23-8 run to end the first half that put the Irish up 42-26. Florida State whittled the lead down thanks to Braian Angola-Rodas, who scored 14 of the Seminoles’ 15 points in one stretch, including a 3-pointer that made it 63-55 with 8:23 left in the second half. A driving hoop by Vasturia and a hustle putback by Colson nudged the lead back to 12 a little more than a minute later. “I think we just kind of combated every run that they made,” Vasturia said. The Irish went 13 for 27 from 3. “They moved the ball around and executed their offense to perfection, and they knocked down some shots that we just couldn’t get to,” Florida State coach Leonard Hamilton said. BIG PICTURE Notre Dame: The Irish have thrived with their small lineup, featuring the 6-foot-5 Colson at center. It puts shooters everywhere on the floor and presents matchup problems for bigger teams — such as Florida State. The Irish forced 18 turnovers to help overcome getting outrebounded 41-23 by the Seminoles. “We’re bigger, but it was hard to take advantage of our size because they went so small,” Florida State’s Jonathan Isaac said. Florida State: Even though Florida State held a rebounding edge, it didn’t do enough damage on the offensive boards. After getting 18 offensive rebounds against Virginia Tech in the quarterfinals, Florida State had nine against the Irish for only eight second-chance points. FOOTBALL SCHOOLS Florida State and Notre Dame have met eight times on the football field, with the Seminoles winning six. In basketball, this was the seventh meeting, third this season. The Seminoles and Fighting Irish split the first two. UP NEXT Notre Dame: The Fighting Irish lost their only meeting with Duke this season, but Brey is 5-3 in his career against his former boss, Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, while at Notre Dame. Florida State: The Seminoles will wait for Selection Sunday to find out their next opponent. They’ll probably be a 3 seed. Follow Ralph D.

Skip to content Repeating Islands News and commentary on Caribbean culture, literature, and the arts Toggle Sidebar March 10, 2017 New York City Bodegas And The Generations Who Love Them A report by Hansi Lo Wang for NPR. Follow the link to the original report for the audio of the broadcast. In New York City, there’s a place on almost every block where you can buy a bag of chips or a lottery ticket. Elsewhere, it’s called a corner store. But in the Big Apple, it’s known as a bodega. In Spanish, bodega can mean “storeroom” or “wine cellar.” New Yorkers like Miriam Gomez, though, know bodegas as neighborhood institutions you can count on at just about any hour of the day or night. “Where supermarkets are closed, the bodegas are open,” she says after making a purchase at Stop One Gourmet Deli on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Still, bodegas are part of a shrinking breed of business in New York, where rising rent and chain stores are putting pressure on mom-and-pop shops. “A lot of them are closing. A lot of people are just giving up. You know, it’s not fair,” says Josefine Rodriguez, who manages Stop One Gourmet Deli. Rodriguez came to the U.S. from the Dominican Republic when she was three months old. She says she’s been shopping at bodegas all her life for cuts of meat and fresh fruit that connect her with her roots. “We’re Spanish people. We got to keep our culture and our things together,” she says. “You can’t just get rid of people just like that.” That bodega culture took shape in the 1940s and ’50s, when Carlos Sanabria’s family would make almost daily runs down the street for milk, eggs, beans and rice. Many different ethnic groups have taken on the business model. But Sanabria, author of The Bodega: A Cornerstone of Puerto Rican Barrios, says the New York bodega is still closely associated with that first generation of entrepreneurs from Puerto Rico. They are among the hundreds of thousands who left the Caribbean for the island of Manhattan and other parts of New York City after World War II. “There were always others — Cubans, some Dominicans, some Mexicans. But primarily if you talk about Hispanics in New York City, you were talking about Puerto Ricans,” says Sanabria, a retired professor of Caribbean history who taught at Hostos Community College of The City University of New York. New York’s Puerto Rican community grew tenfold from about 60,000 in 1940, to more than 600,000 in 1960. And along with the greater demand from new arrivals came more bodegas owned and run by Puerto Rican families who often named their businesses after places on the island. But these days, the people behind the bodega counters selling bottled drinks, cigarettes and candy bars have changed. The number of Puerto Ricans living in New York has been dropping steadily since 1990. Now, other groups are on the rise. Shoyel Abdul says he remembers stopping by a Latino-owned bodega on the Lower East Side every morning for breakfast before school. Now he works across the street from that spot at L.E.S. Mini Mart, which is owned by an immigrant from Bangladesh. Bodegas, he says, remain an important part of the neighborhood. “You know the people. When you work for a corporation, it’s just about in and out. We don’t do that. We talk to our community about what’s going on,” Abdul says. Merquis Garcia, who was born in the Dominican Republic, owns A & M Supermarket, a large bodega in the Bronx. This kind of store, he says, was known as a colmado when he was growing up in the DR. Still, he’s proud to be known as a bodega owner, whose service to his customers sometimes includes dishing out advice on personal problems. “Sometimes they have some problems in their house,” he says. “I don’t know other bodega owners, but I do counseling here too.” Garcia is also the secretary of the Bodega Association of the United States, which estimates there are about 13,000 bodegas currently in New York City. The development corporation has about 5,000 members, most of whom are of Dominican descent, according to Garcia. Now, they’re trying to do more outreach with Arab-American-owned bodegas like Brooklyn’s Yafa Newsstand & Deli, named after the home region in Yemen of Abdul Sulaimani’s family. “It was originally my grandfather’s store, and then he gave it to my dad, his son-in-law. That’s usually what the story is for most Yemeni deli owners,” Sulaimani says. The 21-year-old sometimes takes over the bodega counter from his father in the afternoons. His father took a rare day off in February to join other Yemeni bodega owners in a protest against President Trump’s first temporary travel ban against travelers from Yemen and other majority-Muslim countries. He says his father started his life in America working in bodegas. “My dad learned Spanish before he learned English well enough just because of working behind a counter,” he adds. Now, his father runs his own bodega, which stocks only halal meat and sells newspapers in English, Spanish and Chinese. The family, Sulaimani says, feels part of a quintessential New York tradition. “Corner stores play a huge part in anyone’s life living in New York,” he says. “If you’re not cool with your corner store guy, you’re not from New York.” Share this: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Like this: Like Loading...

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Residents question ‘leaked’ emails calling for support of ballot measure Friday Mar 10, 2017 at 8:53 PM Mar 10, 2017 at 8:53 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — Two emails composed by the town’s public relations firm became the subject of ridicule and legal scrutiny Thursday night during the Town Council’s special meeting. The emails were sent to 50 residents and community leaders, and asked for “attendance and support at an emergency meeting,” during which the Town Council approved a June 6 special election related to its acquisition attempt of the water system currently owned by Liberty Utilities. “It would be great if some of you could attend the meeting and express your support for the town council’s actions,” both emails read. “We are pretty certain Liberty supporters will be there and we would like to see the town represented by people who are concerned about the high costs of water.” Several recipients were in attendance during the meeting and announced their support of the ballot measure, which, if passed by voters, would allow the town to incur debt up to $150 million to fund a purchase of Liberty’s water system. 20/20 Network Partner Tim Gallagher sent the emails at 3:49 and 3:51 p.m. on March 8. It’s unclear exactly when the meeting’s agenda posted to the town’s website, but the Daily Press received notice of the meeting via email from Deputy Town Clerk Debra Thomas at 5:23 p.m. on the same day the emails were sent, a little more than 25 hours before the meeting began. The move angered some residents, who contended the nature of the 20/20 emails was a violation of election law. Former Hesperia Mayor and Citizens for Government Accountability member Diana Carloni-O’Malley said the town allowed 20/20 to “leak” information regarding the meeting before the agenda posted to the town’s website. “It was sent out to public members that are your friends only, nearly two hours before you posted the public agenda,” Carloni-O’Malley said. “And to top things off, you are using public dollars to pay 20/20 to advocate and campaign for the measure before there is an actual election called.” Carloni-O’Malley said the emails appear to be a contribution of public monies as defined in the California Elections Code. That opinion was also expressed by fellow CFGA member Kerry Henard. The section of the code referenced by O’Malley states that a contribution includes payment of public monies for a communication to the public that both “expressly advocates the election or defeat ... of a clearly identified measure, or … unambiguously urges a particular result in an election” and the “communication is made at the behest of the affected candidate or committee.” On Friday, Gallagher told the Daily Press the emails “merely asked people who had previously supported the Town Council’s efforts to acquire the water system to attend the meeting and let the Council know that they supported the idea of holding a vote on the acquisition of the water system.” “In line with prevailing law,” Gallagher concluded, “the email did not advocate a position on the measure.” In response to Carloni-O’Malley’s assertion that the emails were leaked, town spokeswoman Kathie Martin said they were not. “This wasn’t done in secret,” Martin said. “We always assume that the opposing side had people sign up on the email list on the old H2Ours site, so we assume they get anything we send.” Meanwhile, during the meeting, resident Leane Lee said the town’s contract with 20/20 expired Dec. 31, 2016. “Apparently you’ve done another contract or you’ve re-extended (it) ... as evidenced by their (20/20’s) participation in support of this ballot measure in their emails sent out,” Lee said. Martin said she was unsure about renewal dates because the contract is between 20/20 and Best Best & Krieger, the town’s legal firm. Other residents, including Christina Lopez-Burton and Pat Hanson, voiced frustration with what they described as a lack of advanced notice, and they characterized that lacking as an attempt of the town to hide the meeting from a majority of the public. “You must be afraid of what the community will do if you can’t give sufficient notification of this type of meeting,” Hanson said. For her part, Lopez-Burton offered a warning to the Town Council. “Even now, with barely 24-hours notice and a taxpayer-funded PR firm on a retainer, politicians are voting to spend hundreds of thousands on special elections where turnout is likely to be minimal,” Lopez-Burton said. “The town is doing everything possible to play politics with Apple Valley’s water future, including trying to disenfranchise voters … Apple Valley voters held government accountable last November, and they will again this June.” Lopez-Burton’s mention of “hundreds of thousands” of dollars references town documents that show the special election will cost the town $222,000.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Apple’s iPhone fight against non-Apple repair spotlighted where it counts: Teen Vogue By Ethan Baron / March 10, 2017 at 7:14 PM Apple’s battle against a Nebraska “right to repair” bill for electronics has received somewhat limited media coverage, but the firm is now in the spotlight of a demographic for whom the issue is nearly a matter of life and death: teen girls. The Cupertino tech giant has been lobbying against the bill that would enable consumers to get electronics fixed by repair shops instead of just by a manufacturer, according to state senators from Nebraska and New York. Manufacturers who now prohibit or make impossible outside repairs would have to give manuals and diagnostic resources to repair shops. The stakes are high for Apple, because it’s not just about Nebraska, according to the senator sponsoring LB 67, the state’s proposed “Fair Repair Act.” “If LB 67 passes, Nebraska will be the first state to pass this legislation, and it would have a domino effect nationwide,” Nebraska Sen. Lydia Brasch wrote on her website. “This legislation will positively impact all consumers, of all ages and income levels, by adding competition to the electronic repair market. “I did not realize how important this legislation is nationally, until Apple sent lobbyists to my office to oppose it.” New York is also considering a “right to repair” law. New York state Sen. Phil Boyle told Buzzfeed that Apple and other tech firms had lobbied him in opposition to such legislation. Boyle described the current repair regime as “monopolistic.” Opponents of “right to repair” laws argue that trade secrets could be exposed and cybersecurity issues could arise for consumers, Buzzfeed reported. Brasch told the online news outlet that an Apple lobbyist warned her that passage of the bill would make Nebraska a “Mecca for bad actors,” with hackers beating a path to the Cornhusker state. Now, Apple’s push to preserve its hold on repairs is coming before the eyeballs of a key demographic, for whom the tragedy of breaking an iPhone in a fumble-fingered moment of adolescent awkwardness is compounded by the limited funds with which to repair it. On March 10, the issue hit the digital pages of Teen Vogue. For girls wishing to whip up signs saying “Apple ate my allowance” and “My iPhone, My Self” before marching on the capitols of the eight states considering “right to repair,” the good news is there’s no real rush: Nebraska’s Judiciary Committee chair said the bill would probably not be considered this year, according to Buzzfeed.   Photo: Apple CEO Tim Cook introduces the iPhone 7 at the product launch held at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco in September 2016.

Zach Epstein BGR NewsMarch 10, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Dozens of high-profile flagship smartphones will be released in 2017 but truth be told, there are really only a handful of upcoming new devices that consumers at large actually care about. Google’s Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 will be big towards the end of the year, and some people are anxiously awaiting new models like the OnePlus 3T’s successor and a new Moto Z. There are a few more big launches people will be somewhat excited about throughout 2017, but there are really only two announcement that are at the top of everyone’s list. The first comes later this month, when Samsung takes the wraps off its new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ smartphones. Then in September, Apple will unveil the iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus and iPhone 8. We’ve seen plenty of rumors and even several solid reports focusing on all five of those hotly anticipated smartphones, and they paint fairly complete pictures of what we can expect. Of course, it’s still far too soon to expect any leaks to give us a look at the iPhone 8’s new design. In fact, Apple almost certainly hasn’t even finalized its iPhone 8 design at this point. We’ve seen plenty of the Galaxy S8 already though, and each new leak makes one thing increasingly clear: the Galaxy S8 will the sleekest smartphone the world has ever seen when it debuts on March 29th. Is there any way the iPhone 8 can compete with this stunning new design? Don't Miss: New leak shows how incredible Samsung’s Galaxy S8 design really is Three years ago, Samsung’s flagship smartphone designs were… well… awful. We’re not going to sugarcoat it. Samsung’s high-end phones have always touted great performance and class-leading displays, but the company’s plasticky phones of old always looked terrible and felt even worse in the hand. Then, with the Galaxy S6, Samsung finally ditched flimsy feeling plastics and went with an all glass and metal design, which is what we’ve seen out of South Korea ever since. The Galaxy S7 and s7 edge pushed things to the next level, and the Galaxy Note 7 was even better (until it went up in smoke). Now, Samsung has further refined its new design on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, and we’re completely blown away. We’ve seen a bunch of leaks so far, and now two new ones have emerged on Slashleaks. The first comes from a user named “Leakspinner,” and it appears to be completely fake: The phone indeed looks like the Galaxy S8 design we’ve seen several times now, but there are a few indications that this image isn’t authentic. For example, compare it to the genuine Galaxy S8 in the photos exclusively published by BGR earlier this month, and you can see that the graphic on the virtual home button in the image above doesn’t match up. That’s a bit disappointing, but don’t worry because the second leak appears to be the real deal. It comes from Twitter via a Slashleaks user named “Seanmirza23,” who has posted several legitimate leaks in the past, and it shows a Galaxy S8 with a screen protector made by an unknown manufacturer. Of course, it has a fairly unique design, so Samsung will likely be able to figure out the source of this leak shortly after the accessory pictured here is released. Read More As we can see here, Samsung has managed to create a stunning design where nearly the entire face of the Galaxy S8 is taken up by the large Super AMOLED display. The sides of the face curve down, just like other recent Samsung flagships, and the bezels above and below the screen are narrower than ever before. Can Apple’s iPhone 8 design compete with this gorgeous new phone? We won’t know for several more months, but rumors suggest Apple is cooking up something truly special for its tenth-anniversary iPhone. Trending right now: These elastomer iPhone cases are like nothing you’ve ever seen before Super Smash Bros. is coming to the Nintendo Switch Nintendo Switch sales are already soaring See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next Test your PC building skills with the new PC Building Simulator Digital Trends Bundle & Save SpectrumSponsored Samsung is reportedly making a second, more powerful Galaxy S8… but you can’t have it BGR News New navigation app has an awesome feature I’ve always wanted in Google Maps BGR News

What would he like? Is there anything he needs? Since he’s in Portugal and he’s not big on constant texting – it interferes with contemplation, and posting a running virtual commentary isn’t his style – we’re communicating by Facebook messenger (let’s not talk about mobile phones, it’s too painful). “Nah, I have everything I need,” is his response. Hmm. I can’t let his birthday pass unnoticed. No gift, no cake – always that caterpillar – no pausing to remember an arrival so lightning fast there was no time for pain relief? (Though I made up for it with several big puffs when the midwife turned away to measure him. Thank you James Young Simpson, inventor of chloroform anaesthesia, we love you. Hands off Trump, you can semi-claim Alexander Graham Bell I suppose, but Simpson’s ours.) So, what to post? A quick scan of Middle’s FB page confirms he does have everything – in existential terms anyway. His cover photo is now a bay in the Algarve, waves whipped up by an Atlantic breeze breaking onto an expanse of white sand – imagine Scotland with sunshine and heat. Further FB investigation reveals sunrises and sunsets with a band of pals, Middle on a plastic seat in a stream, grinning as clear water flows around his ankles, happy dogs with velvety pointed ears tagging along on walks, Middle and others strumming guitars, contented youths from wherever singing and smiling on a hill top, apple trees and honey bees and snow white turtle doves. Very good. I’ll send more anti-bacterial wipes and condoms. And tea bags, a T-shirt from his brother’s band, black, obviously, chocolate truffle eggs, a drawing pad and pencils, a mini caterpillar cakelet, and a Folio diary with images of spectacular inventions and outrageous contraptions, whimsical flying machines, paper clothing and the like. No matter that the year’s already well under way, so’s Middle Child. Happy Birthday Middle.

Photo: Mark Lennihan, Associated Press How a design maven helped TiVo, Kindle with names 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Karin Hibma, 65, is co-founder and principal of brand-strategy consulting firm Cronan in Berkeley, and is best known for coming up with the names for TiVo and Amazon’s Kindle. Cronan has done work for Apple, Levi Strauss, Estee Lauder and many others. Hibma and her team plumb a client’s history and values to home in on a “strategic identity” for a new product, a new company or to help focus a major change in corporate direction. An art student in the early ’70s at the school now known as Cal State Sacramento, she picked three postings on a job wall for part-time work. The one she chose — a researcher for a commercial art studio — “changed my life.” There was heavy competition for the position. She figures she was chosen because “for other people, it was just a job. For me, it was an adventure. I’ve always been enthusiastic about things. I probably communicate that enthusiasm.” She soon moved to the Bay Area, following a young man she’d met in Sacramento who was designing rock ’n’ roll posters: Michael Cronan, whom she would marry. She introduced him to the graphic design community in San Francisco, which she found “very collaborative” compared with the cutthroat business surrounding the fine arts. Hibma began her own business, Design Resource. She pulled together props, sets and research for advertisers, documentary filmmakers and others, raising eyebrows when she showed up at one shoot with a flatbed truck piled with wooden lanes taken from a bowling alley. She was working for the producer of a Del Monte Foods commercial directed at “sports moms.” He needed a bowling lane. She knew that the Berkeley Bowl bowling center was being gutted to make room for the now-famous grocery store that still bears its name. She saved the bowling lanes from the junk pile. “I made my name with that can-do approach,” she said. Design Resource’s mission was “poorly defined,” she said, “but that meant I could adjust to what anybody needed.” That can-do reputation led to a project researching and writing a Chevron-funded traveling museum exhibit to showcase the creative process of American luminaries in the arts and sciences. She found herself interviewing the likes of Jonas Salk, John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Linus Pauling and Judy Chicago. Collectively, they shared a trait she has consciously applied to her businesses ever since. “These people were so curious, so open about learning, so open to their process,” she said. When she interviewed Margaret Mead for the project, the groundbreaking anthropologist was intrigued, Hibma recalled, telling her, “‘I want to find out what you’re learning from those other people.’” Hibma gave birth to the first of two sons in 1980 and closed Design Resource, while her husband opened Cronan Design, a graphic design studio in San Francisco. Some clients weren’t paying their bills; Hibma came in to collect. She ended up running the business side of the firm. “If any guy came in to run the business, everybody would say they were partners,” she said. Instead, she was “Michael’s wife.” She didn’t think much about it, but on reflection, she said, it illustrates the sexism of the times. She made sure the company always had cash to grow. While the firm accepted a bit of equity from some startup customers, hard cash was the main form of currency. San Francisco and Silicon Valley are littered with small companies that took equity in lieu of cash and didn’t survive. Around 1985, Estee Lauder was working on plans for a retail chain for its Origin beauty products. Cronan spent two years on creative work for the project — color schemes, designs, packaging. Estee Lauder canceled the project, but the contract Hibma had written prevented Cronan from using its work anywhere else, a hard lesson. For future jobs, Hibma insisted that intellectual property stay with the firm. “I still believe contracts are a litany of the hurts each party has experienced,” she said. Sussing out what’s really at issue in defensive contract language, she said, usually results in a better deal for all parties. After her second son arrived, Hibma started a catalog company with contemporary modern apparel for larger men under the brand Walking Man. Michael Cronan, who stood 6-foot-5, had trouble finding high-quality clothing. Enough others did too, and Walking Man become a small but profitable success. Along with Banana Republic, among others, Walking Man helped start the now-prolific business of niche clothing retailing by catalog and eventually online. At Hibma’s suggestion, and with some resistance from her husband, the design firm shifted into corporate branding and identity. Eventually the word “Design” was dropped from the company name. Customers came from many sectors, from the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art to the U.S. Postal Service to technology companies and banks. Signature work for the firm included not just the names but also the brand identities for TiVo and Amazon’s Kindle. After her husband died from cancer in 2013, Hibma was left to run Cronan herself. She had learned a lot from Michael and had contributed plenty of original ideas. Still, she regrets that she hadn’t taken the lead more often in client meetings, even as her husband grew more ill. “I had been the navigator in the front seat while he drove the car,” she said. Now, she’s driver and navigator both. She maintains a rotating roster of three to five clients, serves on two boards and as an adviser to five others, and is writing a book, “Elegant Questions, Design Answers.” She remains, she said, “insatiably curious and enthusiastic.” Russ Mitchell is a Los Angeles Times writer.

Now, he's vying for a shot at a $1 million prize, but first, he'll have to survive being stranded on an island. Alex stars in the new MTV reality show "Stranded with a Million Dollars." The 24-year-old packed his bag and headed to Fiji to compete against nine other young people for the cash. The catch-- if they want food or supplies, they have to pay for them with money from the winning pot. Alex stopped by "The :30" to tell us all about the show. He said the competitors considered boiled root vegetables a delicacy. And he told us he got so sick, he ended up losing 22 pounds. Watch the video for much more from Alex on the show. Now our Keith McGilvery asked Alex whether we should bet on him for the win, but he wouldn't say. You can watch "Stranded with a Million Dollars" Tuesday nights at 10 p.m. on MTV.

Maybe Not. InvestorPlace Brad Moon 6 days ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL Most people flunked this retirement quiz: Can you pass it? Gold's dismal week has investors asking what's after March hike © Lintao Zhang/Getty Images A customer inspects the new iPhone at the Wangfujing flagship store on September 20, 2013 in Beijing, China. Lintao Zhang/Getty Images There’s a big push toward bringing manufacturing home, and Apple Inc. (AAPL) is feeling the pressure. The company has been exploring options for a possible “Made in the USA” iPhone for months, along with its key manufacturing partners. However, the biggest partner of them all, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd (HNHPF) — otherwise known as Foxconn — just threw a big glass of cold water on any hopes there might have been about building an Apple factory on U.S. soil. Made in the USA President Donald Trump made bringing jobs back to America one of his key campaign points, and it’s since become a focus of his presidency. As a result, a long list of companies has committed to moving jobs from offshore locations to U.S. soil. Some of the country’s biggest technology firms are supporting the “Made in the USA” push, including Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), which has committed to adding 100,000 full-time jobs by mid-2018. Even South Korean giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (SSNLF) is looking at opening a U.S. factory to build appliances. How to Trade Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Near All-Time Highs Apple isn’t exempt from this movement. On the contrary, as the world’s most valuable company, Apple is under considerable pressure to do something. Especially when the iPhone — its most lucrative and visible product by far — is made in China. Deflecting criticism, Apple CEO Tim Cook has gone on record as saying it’s the availability of skilled, trained workers that makes outsourcing manufacturing to China the strategy AAPL pursues, not the cheap labor. The possibility of a U.S. iPhone factory is something the company is reported to have asked Foxconn to investigate starting last June. The results weren’t very positive. The latest remarks from Foxconn make the idea of the company building a U.S. Apple factory seem even less likely. Foxconn Chairman Throws Doubt on U.S. iPhone Nikkei Asian Review was at an event marking the groundbreaking for a new industrial park … in China. There, Foxconn chairman Terry Gou commented on the possibility of building a U.S. iPhone factory. He had just returned from a trip to Washington after hinting his company might consider a large display panel factory in the U.S. (for TVs), as well as a molding factory. However, Gou did not sound enthused. In addition to echoing Apple CEO Tim Cook’s concerns about the lack of a trained, skilled workforce, and noting the entire iPhone supply chain is located in China, Gou has concerns about red tape. He told Nikkei: “I am concerned as to whether the U.S. can resolve all the investment issues in only a few months’ time. Does the U.S. offer incentive programs for foreign investors? They’ll need to pass bills first, and we’ll need to wait for American authorities to make a decision first.” In other words, the possibility of Foxconn building an Apple factory here to make iPhones is very low. Made in the USA iPhone Out of Reach … For Now What’s sometimes forgotten is that a U.S. Apple factory alreadyexists. An Austin, Texas, plant churns out the company’s Mac Pro, complete with a “Made in the USA” sticker. Although it’s not exactly churning out these computers, and that’s a problem AAPL is facing as part of the whole U.S. iPhone concept. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Is MUCH More Than Ryzen It turns out that the Texas Apple Factory has faced challenges with having to make its own customized tools and training workers. The situation has been bad enough that some of Apple’s engineers are reportedly pushing the company to move production back to China, if and when a new Mac Pro model is released. Who wouldn’t want to buy an iPhone with “Made in the USA” proudly etched on the back? Unfortunately, economic reality is a big obstacle to this goal. With Apple’s Mac Pro experience, Tim Cook’s obvious concerns and the latest comments from Foxconn, the possibility of an iPhone manufactured in a U.S. Apple factory seems more distant than ever.

Rokk3r Fuel is a new fund from Miami-based venture builder Rokk3r Labs. Rokk3r Labs i By Nancy Dahlberg ndahlberg@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Rokk3r Labs has launched an investment fund and it is already beginning to deploy capital into Miami’s startup community. The Wynwood-based venture builder announced the launch of Rokk3r Fuel this week. The fund will be led by founding partners Jeff Ransdell and Jonas Tempel in partnership with Rokk3r Labs managing founders Nabyl Charania and Germán Montoya. Ransdell said the goal is that Rokk3r Fuel will be a $150 million fund, which would make it one of the region’s largest, and fund-raising is well underway. Ransdell most recently was divisional director at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, joining Merrill Lynch in 1994, and was responsible for $138 billion in private client investments. Tempel, a serial entrepreneur, was co-founder of Beats Music, which Apple acquired in 2014 to create Apple Music, and the first CEO of Beatport, which SFX acquired in 2013. “We see Miami as a growing international destination and hub for entrepreneurs throughout the U.S., Latin America, Western Europe and Northern Africa,” said Germán Montoya, co-founder of Rokk3r Labs, in the announcement. “Jeff and Jonas bring a unique combination of experience and expertise in entrepreneurship and investing at the most established levels. We are thrilled to have them connecting investors to what we’re building at Rokk3r Labs.” Independent of Rokk3r Fuel, Ransdell and Tempel recently were investors in Miami-based Taxfyle’s $2 million fund-raising round. Taxfyle matches tax specialists with consumers and small businesses. Ransdell said he is an investor in 30 to 40 companies although Taxfyle is the first Miami startup he has backed. But that will likely change soon. Through Rokk3r Fuel, “we are going to make some deployments next month. Of those investments in April, they will all be Miami companies,” Ransdell said in an interview. Some of those will be Taxfyle as well as Rokk3r companies AdMobilize and Emerge, he said, as well as some earlier stage companies they will begin to develop. “We will be making more deployments in June.” The whole idea is to inject fuel into these companies at strategic times of their growth. I am here and purposely in Miami to support what I believe is a very, very expanding startup ecosystem. Jeff Ransdell, managing director of Rokk3r Fuel Rokk3r Fuel is aimed at bringing early-stage capital to the best-performing companies emerging from Rokk3r Labs, which partners with entrepreneurs to cobuild ventures. About half of the Fuel portfolio will be from the Rokk3r universe. But Ransdell said the other half of the fund could be from anywhere in the world, as well as other South Florida companies. “The whole idea is to inject fuel into these companies at strategic times of their growth,” Ransdell said. “I am here and purposely in Miami to support what I believe is a very, very expanding startup ecosystem.” Rokk3r Labs, founded in 2012, is currently working with about 40 companies, including Hyp3r, AlzhUp and HotSwitch. It has recently moved its headquarters from Miami Beach to Wynwood. Follow Nancy Dahlberg on Twitter @ndahlberg.

President Trump was in the White House at the time and was unharmed. A man carrying a backpack with mace and a letter for President Donald Trump was arrested Friday night after he breached security at the White House complex and was discovered by a Secret Service officer near the south entrance to the executive residence, officials said. The incident happened just before midnight while the President was at the White House. The suspect, identified in court records as Jonathan T. Tran, 26, of California, told the agency’s officers that he was there to see the President. “No, I am a friend of the President. I have an appointment,” Tran said when approached by an officer, according to a report released Saturday by the Washington Metropolitan Police Department. Asked how he got there, Tran told officers: “I jumped the fence.” The arresting officers found two cans of mace and a passport on Tran, who appeared in D.C. Superior Court shortly before 5 p.m. dressed in a dark blue hoodie and khakis. He spoke only briefly, offering a faint “yes” when told his rights. He faces a charge of unlawful entry and will be arraigned in federal court on Monday. The judge said there was probable cause to hold Tran because he could pose a flight risk and danger to the community. The police report, obtained by CNN, offers a description of the incident. White House security footage showed Tran jumping the face at the northwest courtyard of the Treasury Building, which is adjacent to the White House, the report said. He was not detected, however, until approached by a uniformed Secret Service officer. At one point, Tran hid behind a White House pillar before proceeding to the south portico entrance, according to a complaint filed in US District Court. Secret Service officer Wayne Azevedo said in the complaint that during a search after the arrest, “two cans of mace were found on Tran, including one his jacket pocket. Tran was also carrying among other things, a United States passport, an Apple laptop computer, a book written by President Trump, and a letter he had written to President Trump.” Azevedo also said “in the letter, Tran mentioned Russian hackers and said he had information of relevance. Tran alleged that he had been followed, and his ‘phone and email communications (had been) read by third parties,’ and that he had ‘been called schizophrenic.'” After the incident, the White House was placed under security condition “orange,” one of the highest levels of security for the Secret Service, an agency source said. The President was alerted about the intrusion late Friday night, an administration official said. The suspect was arrested by the Secret Service “without further incident,” the Secret Service said in its statement. Trump said Saturday that the suspect was disturbed, calling the situation “sad” and saying he appreciates the work of the Secret Service. “The service did a fantastic job,” the President said to reporters during a lunch meeting with Cabinet officials at the Trump National Golf Club in Potomac Falls, Virginia. “It was a troubled person. It was very sad.” A Secret Service source said the backpack Tran carried was x-rayed before bomb technicians removed it from the White House grounds for further evaluation. The backpack was found to be free of any hazardous materials, the Secret Service said in its statement. But that brief statement released by a spokesman Saturday morning seemed to downplay the incident and contained very few of the details in the police reports and court records, including how close the suspect came to the residence, his intention to see the President and the mace he was carrying. A special Secret Service intelligence team interviewed Tran, who was taken into custody by Washington police. The suspect has no criminal history and no previous history involving the Secret Service, that agency said. A Secret Service emergency response team searched the entire White House grounds with K-9 dogs, including the first lady’s garden, which is near the south entrance of the residence. Extensive searches were also conducted on East Executive Avenue and East Wing roadway. “Nothing of concern to security operations was found,” the Secret Service said in its statement. The suspect’s 19-year-old younger brother, Brian, from Milpitas, California, said Tran was “troubled” after being laid off from his job at an electrical engineering company. Tran had been “living in his car and eating junk food,” his brother said. Tran graduated from San Jose State University with an electrical engineering degree and had been “stressed out from the job,” his brother said. A Secret Service agent called Tran’s family’s home Friday night to inform them of the fence-jumping incident, his brother said, adding that his mother is “very troubled” about the matter. Tran has been “a very good brother to me,” said the brother, a mechanical engineering major at San Jose State University. The investigation into the security breach continued Saturday as the Secret Service tried to determine how Tran gained entrance to the highly fortified White House complex without being detected, officials said. It is the first known major security incident at the White House since Trump became president two months ago. Jonathan Wackrow, a former Secret Service agent, said Saturday on “CNN Newsroom” that the breach has the potential to be “catastrophic.” “This is really troubling,” said Wackrow, a CNN law enforcement analyst. “If someone came over the northwest fence of the Treasury complex, what that indicates is they didn’t go over just one fence, they went over multiple fences. This has the potential to be a catastrophic breach of the White House complex. This is really disturbing, just the amount of real estate that this intruder was able to gain or bypass on the complex.” “So the Secret Service has to really take a very hard look very quickly as to why weren’t other defense measures alerted,” Wackrow said. Asked Saturday if the Secret Service handled the situation correctly, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said, the “Secret Service did a phenomenal job and they continue to provide phenomenal protection to the President and the first family, and the President was very appreciative of their efforts.” Spicer added that Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly “was kept aware of the situation the entire time.” There have been numerous instances of people trespassing on the White House grounds over the last several years. In one notable instance in 2014, 42-year-old Omar Gonzales, of Copperas Cove, Texas, made it through the north portico doors with a three-and-a-half-inch folding knife in his pants pocket, according to the Secret Service. Gonzalez was apprehended just after making it inside the doors, the Secret Service said. The first family was not at the White House at the time. In another, the Secret Service apprehended Joseph Caputo, of Stamford, Connecticut, on the North Lawn after he scaled the fence wearing an American flag-like cape while the first family was inside the residence celebrating Thanksgiving in 2015. Other incidents of trespassing include: A man tossed a backpack over the north fence in April 2016 before jumping over himself, where he was arrested. In April 2015, Jerome R. Hunt, of Hayward, California, climbed the fence on the south side of the White House complex while carrying a suspicious package, later deemed harmless, and was cornered by security dogs. Dominic Adesanya, 23, of Bel Air, Maryland, barely made it onto the lawn in October 2014 before he was subdued as he fought off two police dogs, the Secret Service said. Adesanya, who suffers from mental health problems, had been arrested in a previous White House breach, his father said. In April 2014, a man wearing a hat of the Pokemon character Pikachu made it over the White House fence and onto the north lawn, where he was apprehended, the New York Daily News reported.

Unpacking the chicken box: The story behind Baltimore's carryout staple News Nation/World Trump praises arrest of 'troubled person' who jumped fence at White House White House intruder Estelle Doro / AP The U.S. Secret Service says a person is under arrest after climbing a fence and getting onto the south grounds of the White House. The U.S. Secret Service says a person is under arrest after climbing a fence and getting onto the south grounds of the White House. (Estelle Doro / AP) Darlene SupervilleAssociated Press President Donald Trump on Saturday praised the U.S. Secret Service for doing a "fantastic job" apprehending a "troubled person" who climbed a fence and was approaching a south entrance to the White House while Trump was inside the executive mansion. It was the first known security breach at the White House since Trump took office nearly two months ago. Washington, D.C., police identified the intruder as Jonathan Tran, 26, of Milpitas, California. When approached by a Secret Service officer on the south grounds about 11:38 p.m. Friday and asked whether he had a pass authorizing him to be in the restricted area, Tran replied, "No, I am a friend of the president. I have an appointment," the police report said. Asked how he got there, he said he "jumped the fence." The Secret Service said in a statement that the intruder, whom it did not identify, had climbed an outer perimeter fence near the Treasury Department and East Executive Avenue. He was arrested without further incident and no hazardous materials were found in his backpack, the agency said. Authorities found two cans of Mace on Tran, including one inside his jacket pocket, according to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court. Tran was also carrying a U.S. passport, an Apple laptop computer, a book written by Trump and a letter he had written to the president, the complaint said. "Secret Service did a fantastic job last night," Trump said Saturday from his golf club in Northern Virginia. He described the intruder as a "troubled person" and the situation as "very sad." Trump was briefed on the matter Friday night, said his spokesman, Sean Spicer. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly was also briefed on the incident, the Secret Service said. Kelly was among several Cabinet secretaries and senior White House staff members who attended a working lunch with the president at the Trump National Golf Club. In the letter found on Tran, he mentioned "Russian hackers" and said he had information of relevance, according to the criminal complaint. He alleged that he had been followed, that his phone and email communications had been read by third parties, and that he has been called schizophrenic. The Secret Service said a search of the north and south White House grounds found "nothing of concern to security operations." Standard practice is to turn intruders over to the local police department. Video surveillance footage shows Tran jumping a fence near the Treasury Department adjacent to the White House security fence, the complaint said. At one point, Tran is seen hiding behind a White House pillar before proceeding to the South Portico entrance. Friday's security breach follows a series of similar lapses that took place during the eight years that Barack Obama was president. An especially embarrassing breach came in September 2014 when an Army veteran with mental health issues scaled a fence on the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House and made it deep inside the building, to the East Room, before the Secret Service could detain him. The Obamas were not at home at the time. The incident was one of several breakdowns by the Secret Service that ultimately led to the resignation of the agency's director, Julia Pierson, the following month. Trump has to find someone new to lead the agency: Joseph Clancy, a former agent who came out of retirement to succeed Pierson and stabilize the law enforcement agency, announced his second retirement last month. Trump said he brought the Cabinet secretaries, White House staff and some of their spouses to the club for a working lunch to discuss the military, the economy, health care and other issues. Besides Kelly, joining Trump were Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, chief strategist Steve Bannon and Spicer. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was absent. "We're having some great discussions," Trump said. "The economy is doing very, very well. Generally speaking we're doing very well." He talked about inheriting "a mess" when he took office, but said everything would be "straightened out fast." Associated Press writer Matt Barakat in McLean, Virginia, contributed to this report.

Armun Asgari (TMFFuture) Mar 11, 2017 at 7:07PM This article is the first in a two-part series aimed at exploring the rapidly developing state of voice computing from the investor's perspective. In Part I, I discuss why it's now increasingly clear that the human voice will become society's next major computing interface, and why it will continue proliferating through our homes and businesses. In Part II, I'll dive deeper into the new and emerging business models. In Part II, I'll discuss the various players involved in the race to commercialize the technology -- those best-positioned to profit today, those positioning themselves to thrive tomorrow, and those dropping the ball entirely. I'll also dive deeper into the fascinating business models voice computing will soon enable, and how those models will evolve as the technology continues to improve. Image source: Getty Images. For nearly 40 years, we've seen the computer evolve into an indispensable accessory of Western society driven by three powerful technologies that defined their eras and played a monumental role for investors along the way. The personal computer gave many of us our first glimpse at the digital world, normalizing the idea that such machines have a place in our homes and everyday lives. The internet tapped us into that world, offering us endless floods of information, entertainment, and commerce around which we willingly began shaping our civilization. And then the smartphone encouraged us to take that digital world everywhere we go, leaving nothing but a few taps on a touchscreen between us, our computers, and constant immersion. Now, a fourth technology -- voice computing -- is removing that last barrier. Reimagining the roles computers play Imagine driving down the highway, coming home from work, and without taking your hands off the wheel or hitting any buttons, asking your car to turn up the heat in your house, preheat the oven for dinner, and play your favorite album, all in the same breath. Picture negotiating with a street vendor in Beijing, having your phone translate the entire conversation between Mandarin and English out loud, so you can haggle in real time. Or how about a stuffed animal that can tell your daughter interactive stories every night before bed, reshaping the adventure at every twist and turn based on her responses and reactions. These aren't hypothetical scenarios -- they're happening right now. The human voice is well on its way to becoming the next major medium we use to interact with computers, and as we'll explore in this two-part series, voice computing is the burgeoning field of technology making it possible. Already spanning multiple consumer and enterprise ventures (think call center routing, digital dictation, or the virtual assistants on smartphones), the industry's ultimate aim is enabling people to carry on hands-free, conversational-style interactions with computers. It's an ambitious prospect capable of significantly expanding the roles computers play in our everyday lives, but it's also one that appears inevitable when considering the trajectory computers have taken, without fail, since their introduction, evolving in shape and form around contemporary technology to solve unmet needs. Image Source: Getty Images. And yet voice computing's evolution is different. Unlike any form of computing to come before it, the technology bypasses the physical realm, allowing users to query the internet, manage their surroundings, and connect to third-party services without ever having to touch a physical device -- all in the time it takes to form a sentence. If that sounds unnecessary, then consider just how limitless the applications could be. From the surgeon who needs to rapidly adjust the conditions of her operating room mid-procedure, to the disabled veteran who simply hopes to access the appliances in his home. The sheer number of everyday applications for such a technology has prompted Grand View Research to project the global market for voice recognition technology will reach $128 billion annually by 2024, an estimate that may undershoot the overall economic opportunity at play considering the potential verticals include healthcare, defense, entertainment, consumer goods, and more (I'll discuss these in more detail in Part II). There is one thing we can be certain of, however. Voice computing is extremely likely to transform the way we interact with technology in society, but before that can happen, a large-scale societal shift toward adopting the interface must occur, a shift that cannot occur until several key hurdles are overcome. Understanding the challenges ahead To analyze those obstacles, let's turn to the most promising application of voice-driven technology today: virtual digital assistants. Data Sources: Socratic Technologies, Vantiv, Statista. Chart by Author. Thanks to the success of the iPhone and Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) other devices, Siri is currently the most widely used virtual assistant in the United States, but until recently, it's also perfectly exemplified what's holding voice computing back. To put it simply, speaking with Siri can often feel more like a novelty than a time-saver, a sentiment shared not just among Apple users, but most smartphone owners with access to similar voice computing technology. It's a problem we can break down into three fundamental hurdles. The first is that users must often resort to awkward combinations of hyper-specific phrasing and hurried robo-speak to have their speech accurately recognized. Andrew Ng, chief scientist at Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and one the most respected names in the field, perhaps put it best in 2015 when he noted, "Speech recognition, depending on the circumstances, is say 95 per cent accurate. So maybe it gets one word in 20 wrong. That's really annoying if it gets one in 20 wrong and you probably don't want to use it very often. That's probably where speech recognition is today." The second hurdle is that even when our speech is correctly recognized, there still remains a strong chance it will be misinterpreted while undergoing natural language understanding, a process in which the assistant attempts to comprehend what we want using the sequence of words (and eventually, the tone, pace, and inflection) we give. And even if that speech is correctly understood, an assistant may still simply be unable to solve for the request due to technical constraints. Examples of both cases can be seen in the screenshot below, along with a sense of how frustrating the encounter can be. Image Source: Author's iPhone. Encounters like these make us feel as though we're wasting our time trusting our phones to do what we could have done ourselves with only a little more effort upfront. Over time, they build up, eventually discouraging us from even trying to use our assistants for anything complex, instead relying on them only for the most trivial of tasks, like setting alarms or creating reminders. Thankfully, these first two hurdles are solvable with data, third-party partnerships, and time, each of which the major players in this space have been actively accruing for years. Returning to our example, since Siri was introduced to the world in 2011, virtual assistants have grown far more capable of correctly interpreting requests thanks to advances in deep learning, a thriving field of AI being utilized by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Baidu, and others to improve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and other components of voice computing at astounding rates. (Click here for an outstanding story by The New York Times on Google's significant role in making this happen). Equally as important, decisions by Apple and its competitors to open their platforms up to third-party services have made today's voice-based assistants feel far more capable than in years past. These decisions allow Siri, for example, to call you a ride using your Uber account, or order a pizza through your stored Domino's information -- not unlike an actual secretary would do. As the potential behind voice computing becomes increasingly obvious in the coming months and years, we should expect more and more third parties to hop on board, eventually expanding the scope of what a partnership could entail (instead of ordering an Uber, imagine ordering a plane ticket). One look at the rate of growth for third-party commands available on Amazon's voice-based assistant, Alexa, can tell us a lot. Data Source: Voicebot. Chart by Author. With time, these technical achievements and partnerships will continue compounding, eventually making for a highly practical voice computing experience. Even marginal improvements in the technology will convince users to begin using voice as an interface more frequently. In the same talk regarding the current state of the voice industry, Ng went on to say, "I think that as speech recognition accuracy goes from say 95 per cent to 98, 99 to 99.9, all of us in the room will go from barely using it today, to using it all the time." He added, "Most people underestimate the difference between 95 and 99 per cent ... 99 per cent is a game changer." Although we're not yet able to predict when the technology will reach that point, if the recent pace of progress is any indication -- since Ng's speech, Baidu has built a program capable of dictating English three times faster, and with 20% less errors, than human beings -- it won't be much longer. In the meantime, an arguably far more important hurdle stands in the way. It's a problem shared by every other major computing medium in use today, only voice is actually solving for it. An instantaneous computing experience No matter the medium, we've always interacted with computers by issuing commands. In the 1950s, we meticulously punched those commands into cards before feeding them into hulking machines. Now, technology allows us to simply type, click, and, increasingly, speak them and expect a result. Yet despite these advancements, today's mediums still subject users to a unique set of delays, a sort of friction that inherently slows down the process between thinking a command and actually being able to communicate that command to your devices. A decade ago, that friction most likely entailed tracking down a PC with internet, using the mouse to open a browser, using the keyboard to run a search, and then sorting for the result. But today, for most Americans, it simply means reaching into our pockets for our phone, scrolling with our thumb, and tapping away. It's a process so effortless, the average American now checks their phone an estimated 46 times per day. It's even become fashionable to argue there's no longer enough friction separating society from our devices; that we're too plugged in to the digital world. So when you consider that voice computing's primary advantage is eliminating friction, it becomes tempting to dismiss the technology as a solution to a trivial problem. What that argument critically fails to consider, however, is that friction is about more than simple convenience, and that any amount of friction, no matter how small, fundamentally limits the dynamic between a user and their computing medium in two ways. Let's take the smartphone for example. Image Source: Pixabay. The seemingly trivial motions we make when reaching for our phone still require us to be in immediate proximity of the device. We have to walk over to kitchen counter if we left our phone there; we have to remember it's on the counter even before we can do that. Then, once we've reached our phone, we're required to physically handle it, a process that generally requires we have one hand free and able. That may not sound like much, but these limitations force our computing experience to revolve around the location of our device, as opposed to it revolving around us. They can create roadblocks for those with disabilities affecting their vision or hands (or really, even those who just have sticky hands, wet hands, or their hands full), those far away from their device, and most importantly, those with an immediate computing need. There's a reason speech is our most instinctual form of communication. If we have a question, and if we know those around us can answer that question, we don't pull out our phone and run a search, we open our mouths and ask. We do that because it's instantaneous. Now contrast that with having to locate your phone, having to type in your password, having to navigate to an app, having to tap, type, or speak your command. These behaviors are not instinctual, but we put up with them because the people around us usually don't have the answers, and because smartphones are our best alternative. But they don't have to be. The rise of voice  It's not obvious quite yet, but today's physically bound mediums have left a large hole to fill and voice computing is starting to fill it. Over the past two years, the technology has begun manifesting itself in the form of always-on, always-listening devices able to virtually bypass the friction inherent in today's major computing mediums. Currently, these devices are best exemplified by Amazon's line of Echo smart speakers, which employ far-field voice recognition technology allowing users to command Alexa from across multiple rooms and through various background noises at any time simply by calling for it out loud. Image Source: Amazon.com. Put another way, for as little as $50, Amazon's Echo is giving consumers their first glimpse at a frictionless computing experience. Following its initial setup, there's no pressing buttons, no looking around for the device, and no navigating through screens to issue a command. When it works correctly (like Siri, Alexa is still very much in its infancy and subject to misinterpreting commands) it really does allow users to convert their thoughts to a command in the time it takes to form a sentence, capturing the essential promise of voice as a medium. And if the early estimated adoption rate for the device is any indication -- Amazon hasn't officially released sales figures, but as of January 2016, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) estimates a staggering 8.2 million Echos have already been sold in the U.S. (a number that pales in comparison to Morgan Stanley's estimates of over 11 million), suggesting the device has achieved well over 5% household penetration -- early demand for a seamless computing experience is strong, and will likely grow stronger as capable competitors race to introduce their own offerings (see Google's Home, Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Spot, or Baidu's Little Fish), and as voice recognition, natural language understanding, and third-party support continue improving at rapid pace.  Data Sources: VoiceLabs, CIRP, KPCB, InfoScout. *2017 figures are VoiceLab projections. Chart by Author. To be clear, these devices will never replace today's existing computing mediums, but will rather augment them. While screens will remain the preferred medium for our more detailed and visual computing needs, voice will begin its ascent by taking on an increasing share of our more "conversational" demands, common requests we want addressed with the immediacy we expect from dialogue ("Cancel my doctor's appointment." "Pause that music!" "What's a good non-fiction book to read on the beach? ... Great, order that one.") As the technology grows capable of handling increasingly nuanced and complex requests, and as voice-enabled devices proliferate and evolve, we can expect more users to grow comfortable engaging with the technology around the home, in the workplace, and gradually more pervasive aspects of society. And that's where the real opportunities begin. The opportunity at hand Some of the biggest tech empires in modern history have been built around the personal computer, internet, and smartphone, each of which has provided the infrastructure for technology to penetrate deeper and more reflexively into everyday life, allowing creative companies to reach consumers in entirely new ways. In just 10 years, the iPhone helped Apple grow to become the largest corporation in the world, but it also popularized smartphone technology in the U.S., helping to create the infrastructure that in turn enabled Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet, Uber, Snap, Amazon, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), and countless others to create businesses that reach deeper into our lives than any before. Image Source: Author's iPhone. And yet voice technology is going deeper. It's becoming an invisible, always-listening medium that surrounds us, weaving itself more seamlessly into the fabric of our lives than any before it. It's called on using our most instinctual, reflexive form of communication, and it's accessible in the time it takes to form words. It's a technology that provides tomorrow's innovators a far more intimate and pervasive way to help us satisfy our digital wants. It's a startling but increasingly inevitable reality for both investors and society. In Part II: The Playing Field, I'll discuss various players involved in the race to commercialize voice computing.

(March 11) Media: Associated Press President Trump praised the U.S. Secret Service on Saturday for doing a “fantastic job” apprehending a “troubled person” who climbed a fence and was approaching a south entrance to the White House while Trump was inside the executive mansion. It was the first known security breach at the White House since Trump took office nearly two months ago. Washington, D.C., police identified the intruder as Jonathan Tran, 26, of Milpitas. When approached by a Secret Service officer on the south grounds about 11:38 p.m. Friday and asked whether he had a pass authorizing him to be in the restricted area, Tran replied, “No, I am a friend of the president. I have an appointment,” the police report said. Asked how he got there, he said he “jumped the fence.” Photo: Estelle Doro, Associated Press Image 1of/57 Caption Close Image 1 of 57 FILE - In this April 17, 2016 file photo, people visit the south lawn during the annual White House Spring Garden tours in Washington.

The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a lower court in Richmond, Virginia, will instead make a ruling in the title IX case and determine how it applies to transgender students. The decision comes after President Trump reversed a federal directive enacted by former President Barack Obama that included bathroom rights for transgender students under title IX and advised schools to allow students to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with.

He was arrested without further incident, the agency said. Authorities found two cans of Mace on Tran, including one inside his jacket pocket, according to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court. Tran was also carrying a U.S. passport, an Apple laptop computer, a book written by Trump and a letter he had written to the president, the complaint said. “Secret Service did a fantastic job last night,” Trump said Saturday from his golf club in Northern Virginia. He described the intruder as a “troubled person” and the situation as “very sad.” Trump was briefed on the matter Friday night, said his spokesman, Sean Spicer. Related Stories Trump praises arrest of 'troubled person' at White House Trump's actions raise fears about access to government data Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly was also briefed on the incident, the Secret Service said. Kelly was among several Cabinet secretaries and senior White House staff members who attended a working lunch with the president at the Trump National Golf Club. In the letter found on Tran, he mentioned “Russian hackers” and said he had information of relevance, according to the criminal complaint. He alleged that he had been followed, that his phone and email communications had been read by third parties, and that he has been called schizophrenic. The Secret Service said a search of the north and south White House grounds found “nothing of concern to security operations.” Standard practice is to turn intruders over to the local Police Department. Friday’s security breach follows a series of similar lapses that took place during the eight years that Barack Obama was president. An especially embarrassing breach came in September 2014 when an Army veteran with mental health issues scaled a fence and made it to the East Room of the White House, before the Secret Service could detain him. The Obamas were not at home at the time. The incident was one of several breakdowns by the Secret Service that ultimately led to the resignation of the agency’s director, Julia Pierson, the following month. Trump has to find someone new to lead the agency: Joseph Clancy, a former agent who came out of retirement to succeed Pierson, announced his second retirement last month.

By Olga Kharif Bloomberg Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Ethan Merchant, 20, of Students 4 Seniors, uses his cell phone to search for an answer to Richard Paul's cell phone Wi-Fi issue during a Senior Empowerment Fair, Sept. 14, 2016, the Clare View Seniors Community Room in Spokane, Wash. (Dan Pelle / The Spokesman-Review) The Wi-Fi icon – a dot with radio waves radiating outward– glows on nearly every internet-connected device, from the iPhone to thermostats to TVs. But it’s starting to fade from the limelight. With every major U.S. wireless carrier now offering unlimited data plans, consumers don’t need to log on to a Wi-Fi network to avoid costly overage charges anymore. That’s a critical change that threatens to render Wi-Fi obsolete. And with new competitive technologies crowding in, the future looks even dimmer. “You could see a big switch,” said Tim Farrar, founder of Telecom Media Finance Associates Inc. “Your coffee shops may be less compelled to provide Wi-Fi for you now.” In an all-data-you-can-eat world, consumers’ use of Wi-Fi at public places like stadiums and airports will drop to a third of all mobile data traffic from about half, Farrar estimates. This means businesses not upgrading public access Wi-Fi as often. Smartphone users might not even turn on their Wi-Fi capability, according to Barry Gilbert, an analyst at researcher Strategy Analytics in Boston. “At Sprint Corp., where unlimited plans are the norm, customers aren’t waiting until they get to a Wi-Fi hot spot to watch the latest video. They are staying on cellular,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. “Customers are rational. When pricing incentives favor Wi-Fi, customers use more Wi-Fi. When pricing incentives shift, so does behavior.” At home as well. Almost a third of people don’t use a home broadband internet connection because they have an unlimited data plan on their phones, according to a survey released Thursday by ReportLinker. The erosion of Wi-Fi’s influence is likely to be slow and uneven. While unlimited data plans make the technology less necessary for phones, many home devices, from a MacBook to an Amazon Echo, still use Wi-Fi to connect to the internet. Wi-Fi also helps fill in gaps in some office buildings and homes that have spotty cellphone coverage. Some wireless carriers also still rely on Wi-Fi networks to handle a large portion of the growing volume of internet traffic. Putting all of that Netflix-binging and Spotify-listening on cellular networks could strain capacity. “Wi-Fi has consistently stayed ahead in terms of performance and its ability to move large amounts of data,” said Kevin Robinson, vice president of marketing for the Wi-Fi Alliance, a consortium of more than 700 companies, including Apple, Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, Intel Corp., Qualcomm and Comcast. “The market is going to decide which technology provides the best capabilities for the end user. To displace a technology like Wi-Fi is likely very optimistic.” Unlimited plans aren’t the only threat. Wi-Fi has survived 20 years and spurred a roughly $20 billion industry of gear, service providers and chipmakers – mainly because its technology is open to innovation and it operates freely in the nation’s unlicensed airwaves. Wi-Fi now faces competition from other technologies that also run in those same frequencies. A new system called LTE in Unlicensed Spectrum – or LTE-U, which depends on a combination of new small-cell towers and home wireless routers – risks congesting the spectrum upon which Wi-Fi relies. In decades past, the nation’s unlicensed airwaves were mostly known for their use by garage door openers, cordless phones, and the occasional baby monitor. Now they’re full of traffic from Wi-Fi networks that connect smartphones, laptops, set-top boxes, game consoles, and a whole host of smart devices to the internet. As LTE-U moves in, Wi-Fi may get drowned out. “Places where operators have traditionally looked to Wi-Fi, they’ll leverage LTE-U,” said Kyung Mun, an analyst at researcher Mobile Experts. Developed by cellular carriers and their vendors, LTE-U may act as a disincentive for companies experimenting with Wi-Fi calling, including Comcast, and those dabbling in fiber networks, like Alphabet Inc.’s Google. But LTE-U also benefits users. Consumers don’t have to type in passwords and sign in to every network like they do for public Wi-Fi hot spots. They can seamlessly move between their carriers’ cellular network and LTE-U, and not really know the difference. LTE-U – and a related cellular advancement, LTE-LAA – will also require less equipment. A 180,000-square-foot building would need 24 new access points instead of about 80 Wi-Fi hot spots, according to Amit Jain, vice president of marketing and product management at hardware maker SpiderCloud Wireless, which plans to ship LTE-U and LTE-LAA equipment in the second quarter. However, the total cost of deployment will be similar to Wi-Fi, Jain said. Annual shipments of LTE-U/LTE-LAA-capable access points will increase to about 1.1 million units globally by 2020, up from tens of thousands in 2016, according to Mobile Experts. “You could see LTE in the house, in the enterprise, and the role of Wi-Fi morphing into something different: a legacy technology,” said independent wireless analyst Chetan Sharma. Companies like Cisco Systems Inc., the No. 1 manufacturer of Wi-Fi access points, are already considering developing new gear that can accommodate both Wi-Fi and LTE-U technologies. “It’s too early to say what will win out,” said Mike Iandolo, vice president and general manager at the mobile technology group at Cisco. “LTE has an advantage, but there’ll still be a place for Wi-Fi.” The company’s goal is to ensure its Wi-Fi portfolio evolves to meet the needs of customers, he said. Another technology that risks making Wi-Fi outmoded is something called CBRS, short for Citizens Broadband Radio Service. The new system lets anyone share a huge swath of spectrum currently being used by the U.S. Navy. In February, Nokia Oyj, Alphabet and Qualcomm tested LTE technology on the airwaves to broadcast a live high-definition video of cars racing on a track in Las Vegas. More reliable than Wi-Fi, CBRS may ultimately be a better option for factories, airports and ports, according to Michael Peeters, head of innovation portfolio management at Nokia and president of CBRS Alliance, whose membership includes AT&T Inc., Charter Communications Inc. and Comcast. The first CBRS devices should be certified for use in mid-2017, he said. On top of all these threats to Wi-Fi is the coming spread of 5G, which promises to let consumers download a high-definition movie in less than a second. By using CBRS, wireless carriers can deploy 5G faster and easier, using the shared airwaves instead of trying to acquire spectrum licenses at auction or through deals. In the nearer term, Wi-Fi is already starting to disappear from people’s daily routines. “Before I would have to go and find a Wi-Fi hot spot, which was very inconvenient for me,” said Michael Kimbrough, an entrepreneur in Birmingham, Alabama, who last month signed up for an unlimited data plan from Verizon Wireless. “Now I don’t have to do that.” Updated: March 11, 2017, 4:01 p.m.  Tags: business, communication, internet, Netflix, smartphones, Technology, wi-fi Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Masthead Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

(Courtesy)SPRINGFIELD — On Saturday, March 4, at the Springfield Regional Chamber of Commerce’s 101st Annual Meeting Event, the chamber hosted an awards ceremony honoring the 2016 Citizen of the Year, Christian Craig, and the 2016 Organization of the Year, The Hartness House Inn and Tavern.  The event was held at the Hartness House with many local chamber members in attendance. Emcee Brian Hernon of HB Energy Solutions introduced Paul Kendall of Lawrence and Wheeler Insurance to announce the Citizen of the Year. As is the tradition, Kendall's speech was carefully constructed to purposely build suspense and prolong the anticipation of the big announcement. He spoke of someone who has done a lot for our community, someone who loves Springfield, who believes in the chamber of commerce, and who would do anything for the town. This person, Kendall said, has a great sense of humor, is a New England Patriots fan, as well as a fan of the Springfield Cosmos. He supports Springfield Hospital, Parks and Rec programs, and is an active member in local civic organizations. This person is a great presenter and teacher, happily married, and a role model to many. This person has been very involved with the Vermont Apple Festival, as well as the Winter Carnival. Craig helped to build the new playground at Riverside, participates in the annual Thanksgiving Day Turkey Trot, and has helped out the Community Health Team, Project Action and the Springfield Prevention Coalition. He was a devoted mentor for a student in the local Let’s Do Lunch program. He was a class participant, and is now on the steering committee for the Leadership Southeast Vermont Program. He was a Rotarian President, and Chamber President for two consecutive years. He was a soccer coach and led his Springfield Girls Varsity Team to the State Championship game. He is the Executive Director of the Edgar May Health and Recreation Center. He leads by example, brings out the best in all those he works with, is instrumental in getting young people involved in the community, goes the extra mile, and constantly puts others and our town on the top of his list. He has a strong work ethic, and the tenacity and perseverance to accomplish any task. He is personable, fun to be around, and has a kind and giving heart. He has a beautiful family, whom he adores, with his wonderful wife Lizzy and their two children Addison and Mac. Sue Hernon of HB Energy Solutions (2015 Organization of the Year) then took the stage to announce the Organization of the Year, The Hartness House Inn and Tavern. She spoke about an organization that recognizes the importance of supporting local businesses and that has successfully incorporated this ideal into its core. The business supports community events and proactively seeks out ways to brighten our community. This organization supports local civic and even religious groups, having a positive impact on our community. This business has been there for Springfield through its most prosperous times and withstood great challenges during more difficult times. The organization has invested in our community, demonstrating its determination to be a leading business in this town and region. While many businesses have cut back on quality to chase market share, this business has raised the bar for its competition, prioritizing quality and trusting in this community to recognize its value. This business is a local treasure which through investment and much hard work by its management is not just an asset, but a business the whole community is proud to call its own. This business supports the local arts and sciences across a broad spectrum. It is a valued member of the chamber and hosts well attended mixers. This business has reinvented itself by reviving its roots which brought it such success in the past. The business not only supports but also showcases our local farms and brewery. This business displays the work of a local painter. The business is a gathering place for lovers of music, through its hosting of both live bands as well as the Springfield Community Band. It was the host and a major sponsor of the Vermont Steampunk Festival. They host weekly Rotary meetings and events, the Community Raffle drawing and Theology on Tap, to name a few. This business provides space to and houses the Hartness-Porter Museum of Amateur Telescope Making, providing tours through the museum and its historic tunnels, free of charge. This business has demonstrated that investment in Springfield brings dividends for both the business and the community. This Inn and restaurant consistently serves the best tasting and incredibly diverse entrees and beverages we have all come to enjoy. Congratulations to the winners, and thank you for all that you do to help make Springfield a wonderful place to live, work and play!

Why should Libya, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria, Somalia and Yemen be the only countries in the world listed for ban? Is it American enough to do so? Why does Trump want to punish innocent citizens of these countries that are simple easy-going Muslims travelling in and out of the United States for the wrongs of a few? If Nigeria was on that list, does that mean that no Nigerian will fly into the US in those 90 days? Are there really implications and what are the lessons? I have read Prof. Wole Soyinka’s past posts on his refusal to fly to countries like Australia and South Africa at a time and also, how at the victory of Trump, he gave up the hopes of residing again in the US. For the Nobel Laureate, Trump won over a larger group of Americans with words that shows racism, promotes white supremacy and black inferiority. Before this travel ban, Soyinka had decided to peg his visits to the US, insisting that Trump rode to victory on the wings of racism. The poet left to create a final home for himself where he cannot be banned. I find it very difficult to say that Trump was wrong in banning the entries of these foreign citizens. I have four reasons for this. Firstly, the war against terrorism is a global war, not an American war; but over the years, the US seems to have been paying the highest price for it. Secondly, terrorists bomb everyone and anyone, including moderate Muslims, without remorse and the US appears like a major target for these terrorists in the last 16 years. Thirdly, no country in the world has spent and is spending as much on fighting terrorism like the United States, hence the most threatened must be the most reactive. Fourthly, America will not protect the interests of others at the detriment of itself, especially when it may involve attacks and the loss of lives of Americans too. Yet, the unanswered questions for Trump are, “Will America continue to own the top companies in the world like Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc. with this kind of ban? Why also should Libyan Christians and other moderate Muslims from these nations suffer this ban? Does Trump think Americans cannot be radicalised to commit acts of terrorism too? Is the US President sure that this will not lead to the economic fall of the American nation and, thus, the emergence of China or Vladimir Putin’s Russia? Won’t this grow anti-Americanism in climes where this never existed? Comparing the two arguments for Trump’s travel ban, I could see clearly that one is focused on the safety of lives of American residents, while the other is emphasising economic gains and protection of non-Americans. With that, the position of the ‘passionate’ American president and realist is clear. I hate to accept Trump’s scientific “stop the growth, find and kill the cancer” approach – but the truth is, you don’t speak English to cancer, you attack it; and terrorism is cancer. Some good non-carcinogenic human cells around the cancer cells may have to lose their lives for the whole human body to survive. The loss of a breast is better than the loss of a life. Recently, Trump must have complied with the court order in the US, but he has made his point, knowing fully well that China and Russia won’t wait for 16 years for full cleansing if the unfortunate 9/11 happened to any of them. From now, we won’t hold America’s security network responsible alone anymore. America will also hold its judiciary responsible. In addition, there may be more intensified efforts to think and curb racism, terrorism and anti-Americanism in the Middle East, as Trump’s travel ban will trigger caution. Attempts to attack American embassies in Libya, Iraq etc. might not generate positive executive decisions within the United States in favour of those countries. Right within the so called Islamic State terrorist group right now, there will be serious caution and realignments too. Whether Trump and the US lift the travel ban on these countries or not, we, as Nigerians, must ask ourselves straightforward questions. What has America done and achieved that makes her the choice destination for many citizens of other countries? Will an American ever live his/her country to come stay with the Tutsis in Rwanda or people in Nigeria, except on business or marital grounds? An American president revoked a valid travel ban because of the order of a judge, whereas in Africa less than three months ago, a president decided to ignore the electoral wishes of 1.8 million people and was bent on holding on to power by all means until he saw warships! In my country, Nigeria, the particular judge that ruled against Trump’s travel ban would have been ignored and probably sanctioned by the powers that be. There are several lessons for Nigeria and Africa; one of them being that that the world is happy to live in a country free of Al-Shabaab, ISIS, Al Qaeda and Boko Haram. In the far corners of the Middle East, one will continue to hear statements like, “I hate America, but I love her products.” Even the late Osama Bin Laden loved Whitney Houston. These are clear indicators that, on one hand, a country (like the US) that is run by democracy, good governance and the rule of law will continue to be the choice of all nations. On the other hand, a country that ignores education, the rule of law and good governance to tolerate illiteracy, unemployment and corruption will soon have citizens working for terrorist or militant groups.

Do West Virginians Recycle? (video) By Glynis Board & Chuck Kleine • Mar 11, 2017 TweetShareGoogle+Email Bale of plastic at Scrappy Pappy's in Wheeling, West Virginia. Credit Chuck Kleine / West Virginia Public Broadcasting In the year 2017, recycling programs exist in several communities in West Virginia, but these programs have not significantly changed the state’s habit of burying trash in the hills. West Virginians are sending about the same amount of trash to the state’s 18 landfills as they have for decades.   In 1989, West Virginia lawmakers passed a bill that’s goal was to reduce residential waste going to landfills by 50 percent by 2010. The bill was necessary to meet federal requirements. According to data collected by the state over the years - West Virginia hasn’t yet made any progress toward that goal. Scrappy Pappy’s Recycling: Pipe Dream or Inevitability? Scott Ludolph owns and operates Scrappy Pappy’s Recycling in the city he grew up in -- Wheeling, West Virginia. He accepts a long list of items at his single-stream facility. “We get rid of probably 30,000 pounds of cardboard and plastics,” Ludolph said as he separated a bag of recyclables recently dropped off. “All your other stuff is glass, metals, other materials -- but that equals about 50,000 pounds a week we do.” Wheeling residents send about 1000 tons of waste to landfills every month (and have for more than a decade). Recycling hasn’t really picked up as a social norm in the city of 28,000 people. Ludolph wants to change the status quo. “This is great to teach our children that not everything needs to be thrown away. We can recycle probably safely 80 to 85 percent of what get thrown in the landfill. So we want to challenge ourselves and make the future better, and make it brighter,” Ludolph said. He and a small crew hand separate, bail and sell the various materials to local companies interested in reusing them. But it’s hard for a small business to play the commodities game and make money because prices fluctuate based on global trends. Scott Ludolph atop bales of cardboard in Wheeling, West Virginia. Credit Chuck Kleine / West Virginia Public Broadcasting Ludolph is also competing with the 2nd largest waste management company in the U.S.: Republic Services. Republic does not offer recycling in Wheeling, and did not return any phone calls for this story. Big companies have few, if any, financial incentives to divest from the much simpler business of landfilling. Ludolph started his recycling business five years ago and says with more community buy-in, he could build a facility that employs dozens. His ultimate dream is to go a step further and manufacture products from the recycled materials he collects.                                               It might sound like a pipe dream, but communities in the Eastern Panhandle have already accomplished something similar. Berkeley County: Realizing the Recycling Dream Clint Hogbin is chairman of the Berkeley County Solid Waste Authority which has created and overseen a recycling program that started in 1995. It’s grown appreciably since then. Berkeley County recycles a wide spectrum of commodities from glass and electronics, to paper, plastic and metals, to yard and food waste. “We have almost an individual market for each one of those items,” Hogbin said. “So you can't name one company or even two or three companies that gets it all.” Berkeley County’s Solid Waste Authority also partners with a local residential waste hauler - Apple Valley Waste. That allows for curbside services for the public. “Generally, [recycling] is not an extremely profitable venture,” said John Decker, the managing partner of Apple Valley. “But there is a cost avoidance when it comes to landfills.” “Landfills will likely be an integral part of the solid waste circle for a long time,” he continued. “But what we want to try to do is move it to the back of the line. So instead of the material finding the landfill first, after being processed recycled, it finds the landfill last. That's our goal.”     And like Scott Ludolph’s dreams of taking recycling a step further - toward repurposing - folks in Berkeley County are achieving the goal by investing in a company called ENTSORGA. Decker explains that leftover waste not recycled on the curb by residents usually only can be landfilled or incinerated. Entsorga processes that waste, reducing the volume even more before it ends up in the landfill. “It's a very simple, very environmentally friendly friendly process.” Decker said. “We basically just dry the waste with just forced air -- no heat, no combustion.” He explained that the waste heats itself just like a compost pile does. Once it’s dry, it’s sorted again, pulling any remaining metals. “The remaining material is a very dry almost confetti like material that happens to be a great product to use either in concert or as a substitute for coal.” It gets used at a nearby cement kiln. “Through all of that we will again reduce the amount of material that's being landfilled down to probably 20 percent. So we will have hopefully an 80 percent diversion rate here in the panhandle in the very near future.” Jobs, Jobs, Jobs “Managing your waste stream through recycling generally create six times more jobs than if you just landfill the material,” said Berkeley County’s Solid Waste Authority chairman Clint Hogbin. “In some cases, more than six times.” Hogbin says it costs communities about the same to recycle as it does to landfill. “We're competitive in the short term, and it's the right thing to do, and we're very competitive in the long term when you look at the end of the environmental costs remediation that you don't have with when you recycle something.” Hogbin says it took a lot of local political support in the face of continuous legal battles with landfill companies to get to where the county is today. He says ultimately, it’s the will of community that makes recycling possible. Listen Listening... / 6:44 Tags:  Recycling Energy & Environment TweetShareGoogle+Email View the discussion thread.

In 2013, McGuinness announced he was stepping down from day-to-day management and sold his Dublin-based Principle Management to Live Nation, with Guy Oseary taking over representation of U2. His affection, admiration and close ties with Bono, the Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen remain just as strong as ever. However, and on Friday (March 11), McGuinness sat down with former Dire Straits manager Ed Bicknell at London’s Royal Garden Hotel for a wide-ranging discussion about his career and thoughts on the music business as part of the 29th International Live Music Conference. “Let’s say I’m lurking in the background, but I have no responsibilities,” McGuinness said about his former clients, who embark on The Joshua Tree Tour later this year in celebration of the album’s 30th anniversary. Here’s some of the highlights from McGuinness’ chat with Bicknell. What made him want to work with U2 the first time he saw them... It was Bono. He was an extraordinary performer even then. U2 came out of the punk ethos. The main influences on them at the beginning were The Ramones and The Clash, and when they got the journalist Bill Graham to go to their rehearsal he said, “Those are Ramones songs. They’re not your songs.” They weren’t expecting that he would know. How U2 came to sign with Island Records... There were two really great guys in the press office at Island called Neil Storey and Rob Partridge. They were fans and they pushed it within the company. And there were two A&R people, Annie Roseberry and Nick Stewart, and they drove it. Chris [Blackwell] wasn’t really very keen on U2 at the beginning. But [Island] were literally the only label that wished to sign us. So it wasn’t a particularly good deal, but we have been improving it ever since. How 1992/‘93s Zoo TV tour forever changed the live business... The production was ground breaking. It was also bank breaking. It was expensive and scary for me. Because we were still operating like a punk band with low ticket prices. We were at risk with every show. If one of those promoters had not paid we would have been ruined. So by the end of that tour, which didn’t make any money, I resolved I was never going to do it ever again. The ramifications of that spread throughout the industry. I said the next tour is going to be underwritten by a single global promoter and that’s when we started working with Arthur Fogel and Michael Cohl. That deal became Clear Channel and is now Live Nation. The relationship with Arthur is absolutely at the heart of U2’s business. Leading the fight against YouTube and tech companies on behalf of rights owners...   It was difficult for me at times because what I was really saying was that the Internet as the new means of delivering music is not sharing its income with performers, writers, labels and publishers. So it was easy for some people to take a shot at me and say, “He just wants more money for U2. They’ve got enough.” But in fact my argument was a comprehensive [one]. All artists were being mistreated. And getting artists together to campaign for more money for artists is hard. It’s hard enough to get a band to go a meeting with just the other band members. The new battlefront... The argument has moved along now. It’s no longer about illegal downloading. It’s about transparency. Artists have deals nowadays with their labels where, one way or another, I hope they are promised a share of the new kind of income from Spotify, Apple and other streaming services. [But] most artists, I think it’s fair to say, do not think they are getting a fair share. Where the music industry went wrong...   We rode the CD boom of the ’90s and what a wonderful thing that was. However, flushed with that success the music industry went into this period of complete lazy decline. Anyone who thought past Christmas was regarded as a strategic genius. So then when Napster arrived and peer-to-peer they were completely unprepared for it and reacted by trying to prosecute grandmothers. Brexit and losing out on tax breaks...   Copyright doesn’t depend on the EU, and copyright industries like film and television and music are huge in Britain. I don’t think Brexit is the end of the success of the British music industry. But it would be useful if, for instance, Britain were to treat its music industry with a bit more respect and love. In film, television and post-production in Britain there are extensive tax credits offered by the state. Why are those tax credits not offered to the music business?   Addressing the value gap...   What surprises me to this day is how completely selfish, greedy, neglectful and oppressive the Google/YouTube/tech environment is. These massive, massive companies, which have been built on the back of free content, are still reluctant or refusing to take proper responsibilities. It’s now very clear that the download is pretty much irrelevant. Streaming is the future. Spotify is going to be the biggest distributor. No one really cares about ownership. It’s all about access and access will be ubiquitous for film, television and music. YouTube historically have been so extraordinarily greedy. I hope that changes. They’ve hired Lyor Cohen to build bridges with the music industry and I'd really like to see some change there because it really has to be confronted. The only investment in music is coming from record companies. Scalping and the secondary ticketing market...   I know there’s a sense of unfairness in the air. People go online to buy a ticket and think they have an equal chance of getting that ticket. If two minutes later they see the same tickets being scalped, it’s a miserable feeling. It has to be acknowledged that certain promoters, certain managers and certain acts connive at this. You could say it’s unfair that members of the U2 fan club get a two day jump on the rest of the public -- knowing as they do that many members of U2.com are bot operators. I don’t really know what to do about it. There’s good scalping and bad scalping. If you sell four tickets at face value to a college student at $100 each and when the gig takes place six months later the market value for that ticket is $300. Who is going to say to that college student, “You’re not entitled to sell that ticket and make a profit?” It’s very hard to address fairly. It’s a market that defies regulation. I have never seen a comprehensive proposal to deal with this fairly and where do you stop? Will it then extend to Wimbledon and football matches? Are you going to clean up the whole of the ticket economy?   The new world order... The cycle we were used to of album and tour is no longer relevant. Artists must engage on a much more continuous basis. That’s why the live industry is thriving. If I were in the business now I would be very interested in what’s going on because you can release worldwide simultaneously in a much more meaningful way on Spotify and Apple now than was possible years ago. Copyright and safe harbor... The general paradigm is that YouTube is distributing music and paying the labels and publishers legally, but they are paying them such a tiny, tiny amount under deals that are long since outdated. YouTube is keeping the money and they are able to invoke the safe harbor legislation that protects internet distributors from copyright. That’s the case in America and in Europe. But in Europe there’s a change coming and for the first time ever the European commission is starting to address copyright.   Why no one in U2 has ever made a solo album... I don’t know if they could. I think they find it so hard to make a U2 record that to make more records without the other three musicians -- that they each know best in the world -- the idea would not appeal to them one little bit. They can all do pretty much what they want within U2.   Bono the activist... He’s an extraordinarily charismatic individual. He’s also a very committed Christian. It’s at the heart of what he does. And he would say that if the light is shining on you, you can turn that light onto other issues. I’m well aware that he annoys people by using his celebrity to promote causes of inequality and unfairness. I think what annoys people is that he does this at the same time -- and he says this himself -- as being a spoilt rotten filthy rich rock star. That gets up people noses and it will continue to because he’s not going to stop. But his political achievements and his achievements as an activist are very considerable.   FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Comments Magazine Customer Service Subscribe Buy this issue Billboard biz The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.

However, along with Google, Microsoft’s Cortana is looking to make itself a serious alternative on Apple’s platform, and the latest update brings it closer to matching iOS‘s native option. Released on Friday, the new Cortana for iPhone app has been overhauled with a new interface, and includes several new features that make it easier to use. Along with a new menu that features a heavy use of purple, the new version of Cortana has improved responsiveness and faster load times. The assistant begins listening immediately after opening, allowing commands or questions to be spoken right away. The app’s homescreen can also display information on things like news, weather, package status, traffic, and nearby locations. The calling, texting, and reminders features have all be redesigned, and when asking Cortana to perform searches, the results will now be displayed on a full page. For times when users can’t or don’t want to issue voice commands, a menu accessible from the bottom-left of the screen will display a number of “quick action” options.

Las Vegas Sun March 16, 2017 Currently: 85° — Complete forecast Las Vegas Sun The Sunday News Vegas INC Opinion Sports Politics Entertainment Las Vegas Weekly Events Sports betting UNLV sports Gaming Education Vegas Golden Knights Smith's World HS Basketball Newsletter signup Lefties, techies long at odds in SF, team up against Trump By Nicholas Riccardi, Associated Press Saturday, March 11, 2017 | 12:44 p.m. SAN FRANCISCO — Before Donald Trump's election, Laurence Berland viewed political protest as a sort of curiosity. He was in a good place to see it: San Francisco's Mission District, once an immigrant enclave in the country's heartland of radicalism that is increasingly populated by people like him — successful tech workers driving up rents while enjoying a daily commute to Silicon Valley on luxury motor coaches. Berland regarded the activism of his adopted city with a mix of empathy and bemusement, checking out Occupy Wall Street demonstrations and protests against the gentrification of his own neighborhood. But now there is less distance between him and activists on the street. On a recent day Berland stood with about 100 others — from software engineers like himself to those who work in tech company cafeterias — outside a downtown museum for a rally against President Trump. "Everyone come closer! We're going to practice some chanting, and we're going to get to know each other," called a woman wearing a union T-shirt with a bullhorn pressed to her lips. The crowd closed in around a banner reading "Workers in Tech Say No Ban No Wall." A clipboard-carrying organizer approached Berland to ask if he wanted to join a network of grassroots activists, but Berland waved him away. He had already signed up. In the place that fought against the Vietnam War and for gay rights and, more recently, has been roiled by dissent over the technology industry's impact on economic inequality, an unlikely alliance has formed in the left's resistance against Trump. Old-school, anti-capitalist activists and new-school, free-enterprise techies are pushing aside their differences to take on a common foe. For years, these two strands of liberal America have been at each other's throats. There've been protests against evictions of those who can't afford the Bay Area's ever-soaring rents. And think back, not so long ago, to the raucous rallies to block those fancy buses shuttling tech workers from city neighborhoods to the Silicon Valley campuses of Yahoo, Facebook, Apple and Google, where Berland once worked. Cat Brooks, a Black Lives Matter activist in Oakland, has seen the toll the tech industry has taken on some. Her daughter's elementary school teacher just moved to a distant suburb after her rent skyrocketed, and Brooks thinks more tech money must find its way into local communities. She nevertheless welcomes the infusion of new energy to the protest arena. "It's not about the business of we were here first," she said. "We're about the business of how can we support? Division at this time is not helpful." Such improbable partnerships scramble the historical protest model that used to pit working-class people against everyone else, said Rory McVeigh, director of the Center for the Study of Social Movements at the University of Notre Dame. "There are new cleavages that can produce alliances that weren't possible before," McVeigh said. "When you feel all of you are being threatened but in different ways ... trade-offs are minimized. You realize at times such as that that you need allies more than ever before." If all politics is personal, as the saying goes, the moment it got personal for the tech industry was when the Trump administration imposed its initial travel ban on immigrants and refugees from seven majority Muslim nations. The industry prides itself on its openness to immigrants, who comprise about one-quarter of the U.S. technology and science workforce and include the founders of iconic institutions. Nearly 100 tech companies, including Google, Facebook and Uber, filed a court brief urging suspension of the ban, while Google co-founder Sergey Brin, a Russian immigrant, joined protests at San Francisco International Airport. That was followed by an unprecedented companywide walkout at Google and now, on March 14, nationwide rallies are planned for a "Tech Stands Up" day of protest. "People in Silicon Valley, it's really hard to get them excited about things that aren't technical," said Anita Rosen, a technology project manager who has started an activist group in the Valley suburb of Mountain View. "But everything that Trump says is the opposite of what we believe. He hates technology. He hates foreigners." The morning after the election, Jesse Pickard convened the daily meeting at the technology firm he runs, Elevate. He could see the fear and heartbreak in the faces of his staff of 21, some of whom are legal immigrants. He tried to inspire them to fight for all the things that made them first fall in love with the United States. Then he set about doing that himself. Pickard wondered if the door-knocking he'd done for Hillary Clinton had been the right use of his talents. "I didn't feel I was having the impact I could have if I was meaningfully using my design skills," he said. And so Pickard launched DeBug Politics, a series of hackathons where teams of software engineers create apps to fight Trump and get more people involved in politics. Winning products include a Chrome browser extension that points viewers to news that doesn't match their ideological viewpoint, and a tool that allows people to urge followers on social media to contact elected representatives. Pickard's company is based out of a three-story converted brewery in San Francisco's trendy South of Market district. Sitting at a picnic table on the rooftop deck, where the company chef sometimes serves employees lunch and dinner, Pickard acknowledged that tech workers generally had a protected life. "Prior to the election ... you didn't have a lot to worry about if you got a six-figure job right out of school and got catered lunches every day," he said. "They had all these left-leaning and progressive opinions, but they didn't feel like they had to fight very much." He's been to a couple of demonstrations — his first in years — but Pickard thinks he can make more of an impact through technology. Kai-Ping Yee feels the same. Yee moved to the Bay Area from Canada in 1998, earned his PhD at the University of California, Berkeley, and landed a job as a software engineer in Google's philanthropic unit in 2007. Now he works at a startup to help immigrants send cash home. Though he's never been to a protest, the 40-year-old Yee sees himself as a kindred spirit with his leftist neighbors. "I do sympathize with a lot of the goals and the values behind these protests," he said, "but have focused my effort on work." Part of that work has been creating an online pledge, signed by thousands of technology workers, against building databases for any potential Muslim registries or to aid deportations of immigrants. Yee is a Canadian citizen, though he is a legal permanent resident of this country, and he's been shocked at having to think about a contingency plan should life in the U.S. become impossible. "People whose pedigree is knocking on doors and calling representatives and waving signs are getting together with people who design apps," Yee said. "People are working with people who do really, really different things because they realize it's an emergency." Veteran activists said they are heartened by the civil awakening among tech workers. Debra Cleaver runs VOTE.org, which tries to make absentee voting easier with online tools. She said the greatest help may be tech companies using their copious coffers to fund legal challenges or otherwise fight back. Google, for example, created a $4 million crisis fund to help those affected by Trump's travel ban. However, Cleaver cautioned against efforts to "engineer" a way around the effects of Trump policies. "I'm sure they're all trying" to design new apps and systems to fight Trump, she said, "and they're going to find out that tech can't solve this problem." Others aren't so sure about sharing the streets because they don't think they share the same ultimate goals. Franki Velez, an Iraq War veteran on disability, stood outside an Oakland rental office recently with other longtime activists and renters fighting eviction. There was not a technology worker in sight, and she worried that they are missing the point anyway. They want to change, but preserve, a system that's benefited them, she said, while protesters like her want to tear the system down and start from scratch. "They don't understand it's a colonial system that's never meant to be reformed," she said. Still, while their approaches can be strikingly different, Velez's causes are increasingly being adopted by people not like her. Velez's group marched to a Wells Fargo branch to hand over a demand that the bank stop investing in the Dakota Access Pipeline. Two hours later, in the comfortable Silicon Valley suburb of Campbell, biotech executive Michael Clark drew cheers after telling a gathering of anti-Trump activists that he'd closed his Wells Fargo account to protest the pipeline. Clark grew up in New Hampshire and then in Silicon Valley, when his mother took a job at Apple in the 1990s. He always considered himself a political independent, a moderate. But Trump's election horrified him and, with a friend who runs a gourmet chocolate shop, he founded a chapter of the national liberal group "Indivisible" in Campbell. "The country has moved so much to the right that puts me in the middle with people I wouldn't have previously been aligned with," Clark said. "It's interesting that someone like me is on the same side as a lot of socialists." The two worlds don't always intersect, but when they do it can verge on the surreal. At the anti-Trump protest Laurence Berland attended outside the Children's Creativity Museum, union leaders railed against the president, as did immigrant cafeteria workers in Spanish. Dana Sniezko, a veteran of local progressive causes who had worried the city was losing its radical edge amid tech-driven yuppie-ization, passed out homemade stickers reading "Resist" and said: "I think San Francisco is waking up." Passers-by stopped and stared. A handful wearing tags that showed they were in town for a cryptography conference flashed a thumbs-up. Praveen Sinha, a cryptographer who works at a Silicon Valley digital security firm, began to address the crowd. Sinha, who was born in the U.S., has long been active in liberal causes but despaired that many of his immigrant colleagues were afraid to protest for fear of encountering problems with the Trump administration in the future. "We're all in the same boat here," he told the crowd, bemoaning how Trump was playing on racism to deny people from around the world the chance to contribute to America. Afterward, Betsy Stone approached Sinha and identified herself as a member of the Socialist Workers Party who spent the previous year talking to voters. "We didn't find racism or sexism or xenophobia," she said. "We found people who say, 'We need jobs like we used to have.'" Stone, 77, was a blast from the Bay Area's radical, working-class past. She toiled as a janitor and told Sinha about once being dismissed by an airline company after it hired a contractor who could use immigrant labor for less money. "Great energy comes from all walks of life," Sinha told her. "The whole world cannot come to the U.S.," Stone countered. She and Sinha obviously disagreed about much, but then the conversation turned from their differences to their mutual disgust of Trump. Finally, Stone handed Sinha a copy of a socialist newspaper and went on her way.

LG Electronics fired the first salvo during the show with the LG G6, a high-end device that boasts a large screen and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor. The way is clear for LG at MWC because Samsung isn't scheduled to introduce its high-end handset, the Galaxy S8, until a March 29 media briefing and Apple won't showcase its latest iPhones until September. However, the LG G6 has a new design concept that could be remarkably similar to the Galaxy S8. The G6 promises to be an attractive option for many smartphone buyers this year. But the handset has some limitations that may hinder it from being a serious rival to the Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8. This slide show will cover the reasons why the LG G6 could be a top popular model in 2017 and a few reasons why it might disappoint buyers. 2 of 12 Where Did the Physical Home Button Go? In a sign of things to come, LG has eliminated the physical home button in the G6. Instead, the device has virtual buttons on the home screen and a fingerprint sensor on the back. Samsung is said to be planning the same feature in the Galaxy S8 and Apple, too, could remove the Touch ID button in the iPhone 8. 3 of 12 LG Touts the Display The removal of the home button leaves more room for the display. The G6 features a 5.7-inch screen with a 2,880-by-1,440-pixel resolution and an 18:9 aspect ratio, which LG says should deliver a better visual experience. 4 of 12 There's Dual Lenses on the Back There are two rear-facing camera lenses in the G6, both of which come with 13-megapixel sensors. The main camera is a standard lens featuring optical image stabilization and a wide-angle lens. A 5-megapixel camera is on the front. 5 of 12 It's Built to Resist Shocks, Water Immersion LG’s G6 has been “built for the unexpected,” the company says. The device has an IP68 rating, so it’s resistant to debris intrusion and can survive in up to 3 feet of water for up to 30 minutes. It’s also been built to meet military-grade standards, ensuring it survives a drop at several feet. 6 of 12 The G6 Will Support Google Assistant The G6 is one of the few handsets available now that supports Google Assistant, allowing users to search the internet, control the smart home, make calendar appointments and much more. 7 of 12 But It Runs Last Year's Snapdragon LG isn’t offering the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor in the G6. Instead, the handset will use last year’s model, the speedy Qualcomm Snapdragon 821. However, it appears Samsung, which worked with Qualcomm on the 835 chip, will be the first to offer it in it the Galaxy S8. 8 of 12 The Removable Battery Is Gone LG last year differentiated its G5 by offering a removable battery in the device. That feature, along with the ability to swap out other components, is now gone. LG is following other high-end device makers by not allowing customization to its device. 9 of 12 On-Board Storage is Unimpressive The G6 will be offered with the customer’s choice of 32GB or 64GB of onboard storage, which isn't much when smartphone users are taking more videos and photos than ever.

The apps have since been removed. Google, like rival Apple, has put considerable effort into ensuring that its official mobile application store is malware free, but that hasn't totally stopped malware-laden apps from being uploaded to its store anyway. The latest case in point is the discovery of 132 Android apps in Google Play, with a bug in them. Security firm Palo Alto Networks recently discovered the apps and reported them to Google, which has since removed them. The apps belong to seven unrelated developers and include one that has been downloaded more than 10,000 times. Many of the apps are for design ideas for everything from cheesecakes to coffee tables. The one common denominator among them is that all seven of the developers have an Indonesian connection, Palo Alto Network researchers Xiao Zhang, Wenjun Hu and Shawn Jin said in an alert this week. Further reading NetMotion Delivers Device Management Tools Uber Greyball Making Company Less 'Evil' According to the researchers, all 132 apps have tiny hidden iFrames linking static HTML pages inside the apps to malicious domains. An iFrame is an HTML element that developers use to insert content from other sources into a web page. All of the infected apps employed an Android WebView component for displaying locally stored images and text via static HTML pages. In this case, the iFrames linked the HTML pages to several well-known malicious domains. None of the malicious domains to which the apps connected were active when Palo Alto Networks last reviewed them. And interestingly enough, the malware on the apps was designed for Windows systems and posed no threat to Android users. Still the infected apps show how malware writers have begun using platforms like Android as carriers for malware targeting other platforms, the three Palo Alto Network researchers said. In this case, the developers of the infected apps themselves appear to have been oblivious to the presence of the malware in their code. It is likely that attackers targeted their own development platforms and inserted the malicious code in them, which later found its way into the apps. Palo Alto Networks' discovery of the infected apps is by no means the first time that security researchers have found malware on Google's Play Store. Just last month, researchers from Check Point Software Technologies announced they had found a variant of a prolific malware sample dubbed HummingBad installed on about 20 applications on Google Play including some that had been downloaded millions of times by Android users. Last year, security vendor PhishMe reported that it had found 11 malicious applications masquerading as legitimate payment applications on Google Play. The growing presence of malware-laden applications in official app stores like Google Play and Apple Store pose a big threat for users. Security researchers have long advised mobile app users not to download apps from unofficial third-party stores because of potential security risks. But the presence of malicious apps in official stores is making it riskier for users to download apps from these sources as well. Google has put in place multiple automated and manual checks to prevent cyber-attackers actors from uploading malware to Play. The company also has a Google Play App Security Improvement (ASI) program, through which it offers tips and guidance to developers on how to ensure their applications remains free of security issues.

Warren Hayden 09:00 Saturday 11 March 2017 0 Have your say There is no getting away from the fact that I live in a world of pink. That’s right, the colour associated with femininity, romance and sensitivity is everywhere I look. Apart from my springer spaniel Ralph, I’m the only male in the house. I live with my fiancée Serena and our two daughters Caitlin and Alyssa. But the colour that fills the bedrooms of my two daughters and beyond has been given quite a makeover. I think it all started a couple of years ago with Apple naming the colour of one of their iPhones Rose Gold. It soon became clear that this colour was, in fact, pink. Apparently, in 2017, the world’s catwalks have models striding up and down in colours including dusky rose and millennial pink. But it’s now the boys and men of the world who are being seen in the colour. Second in line to the throne Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, wasn’t afraid to embrace the really bright colour on an overseas trip with his wife Catherine where he was pictured wearing a pink T-shirt. Mega-famous Hollywood star Will Smith chose to wear a smart checked shirt with a polka dot tie, both in the colour of pink. And even footballing hero David Beckham can often be seen with a bright pink scarf around his neck at this time of year to keep himself warm. So it seems the common opinion that blue is for boys and pink for girls just isn’t true any more, and it’s even being said that there are advantages to men wearing pink. These include standing out from the crowd. Apparently, the colour makes you appear more confident, goes well with all other colours and is seen as the most versatile. But it doesn’t stop there. There are health benefits too with tests showing that staring at the colour pink can lower your heart rate. So maybe I shouldn’t long for a man shed at the end of the garden when I’m surrounded by pink. I need to embrace the bright colour brought into my world by the three females with whom I live. But this is 2017, so from now on I’ll refer to it as rose gold and of course if I’m stressed out and my heart is pumping a little too fast, I know what to do. Apparently, pink makes you appear more confident, is the most versatile and can lower your heart rate.

By David Mikkelson Mar 11th, 2017 2 Exhortations to citizens to boycott or otherwise cut off the financial funding of those who express unpopular viewpoints or engage in controversial activities have long been a part of the American political landscape. In early 2017, one prominent instance of this phenomenon has involved the controversial conservative web site Breitbart, which has been targeted by social media campaigns seeking to cut the site’s online advertising revenues, the lifeblood of many digital publishers: Conservative news website Breitbart News has gotten a lot of attention since Donald Trump was elected, in part because former Breitbart chairman Steve Bannon is now a senior strategist advising the president. But not all of the attention it has received is good. Over the past month or so, a social media campaign has gradually gathered steam that is aimed at convincing advertisers to stop doing business with Breitbart News. It appears that this campaign is now affecting how even large advertising agencies think about the site, which is known for its ties to racist groups. According to a leaked memo obtained by BuzzFeed, an Australian agency owned by the global advertising giant Omnicom — which handles advertising and marketing campaigns for all of the major Fortune 500 brands including McDonalds and Apple — has advised its staff that many of the firm’s clients are asking that their ads not appear on Breitbart. The memo mentions the crowdsourced anti-Breitbart campaign known as “Sleeping Giants,” which encourages Twitter users and those on other social networks to shame large companies into not doing business with Breitbart. The latest update says that over 1,000 advertisers have blocked the site from their media-buying programs. Of particular note in the online world in March 2017 were petitions urging retailing giant Amazon.com to stop “supporting” Breitbart through advertising: Breitbart.com is notorious for its racist, misogynistic, hateful propaganda hiding under a thin veil of a ‘news’ site. One of many examples of the misogyny was exposed in a 2011 radio interview when Stephen Bannon (a Breitbart executive and current president-elect’s chief strategist/senior counselor) made the following statement: “…That’s why there are some unintended consequences of the women’s liberation movement. That, in fact, the women that would lead this country would be pro-family, they would have husbands, they would love their children. They wouldn’t be a bunch of dykes that came from the Seven Sisters schools up in New England. That drives the left insane, and that’s why they hate these women…” Kellogg’s has pulled their advertisement from Breitbart.com because the site “does not align with their values.” It is hope that Amazon will be willing to make the same stand that Kellogg’s and other advertisers have taken, turning away from a website that incites divisiveness and hate for no other purpose than to line their own pockets. As BuzzFeed reported in early February 2017, efforts — unsuccessful so far — to sever ad ties between Amazon and Breitbart were coming not just from the public in general, but from within Amazon’s workforce itself: As Amazon positions itself as an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, inside the company, dozens of employees are voicing deep concern about another political issue: Amazon’s choice to advertise on Breitbart.com. According to internal emails and documents obtained by BuzzFeed News, employees have begun voicing concerns about the company’s advertising relationship with the provocative far-right website. Some piled on to a complaint ticket in Amazon’s internal issue escalation system urging the company to sever its relationship with Breitbart, the site that former editor and now–Senior White House Advisor Steve Bannon once called “the platform for the alt-right.” Others are taking even stronger stands. “Without naming names, I can attest that several employees have come to me in the past month questioning this exact point and I’ve stopped them from leaving the company,” one employee wrote on an email chain of worried Amazon employees. Despite this internal unrest, Amazon has given no indication that it is changing its advertising relationship with Breitbart. Responding to the complaint ticket, Amazon’s ad team said it would not block the site from its program and closed the ticket from further responses. In the online world, relationships between advertisers and publishers are not so straightforward as many people unfamiliar with the digital publishing industry might think. Rather than specifically buying ad space on particular web sites, advertisers often place ads through third-party ad exchanges, who programmatically fan those advertising buys out to their network of member sites. In Amazon’s case, that means Amazon customers may encounter Amazon advertisements on any of a number of different sites they visit (including Breitbart), while non-Amazon customers may never see any Amazon ads at all (on Breitbart or elsewhere). So, in this case the level of Amazon’s advertising on Breitbart is largely driven by how many Amazon customers choose to visit Breitbart, not by how much money Amazon chooses to allocate to placing ads on that publisher’s site. Still, Amazon could choose not to do business with ad exchanges that include Breitbart among their clients, or possibly in some cases instruct those exchanges to exclude Breitbart from their ad placements. Amazon has not yet responded to our request for comment about their advertising policies regarding Breitbart or whether they plan to alter them, but BuzzFeed noted that as of early February 2017, the online retailer was seemingly not inclined to take any action in that regard yet: Amazon’s Associates program’s rules explicitly state that publishers using its advertising API may not “promote discrimination,” a line item that a number of Amazon employees feel Breitbart violates. “As per guidance from PR/Policy/Legal, the DA team are not blocking breitbart.com,” Amazon’s ad team wrote. “As per prior guidance ‘our customers are choosing to go there. It is not our place to assume why they’re going there, or impose our own standards.’” The ad team did specify that it was looking into a “longer term solution to use a 3rd party brand safety which may block amazon ads from showing up on certain pages on sites like Breitbart in the future.” Snopes Delivered to Your Inbox: Feedback Author: David Mikkelson Featured Image: change.org Published: Mar 11th, 2017 Hot off the press, straight to your inbox View All Latest Video PacerTestBannedforChildCruelty?

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars MOBILE Guest 5 things Silicon Valley needs to know about India’s massive smartphone market Balaji Krishnan, DabKick@kijalab March 11, 2017 10:25 AM Tags: Balaji Krishnan, INdia Above: HYDERABAD, INDIA-JULY 7: Indian men taking a selfie during Ratha Yatra procession. Image Credit: reddees/Shutterstock Every time I return to India to visit colleagues and family, I’m amazed to see how quickly smartphone adoption has overtaken the country. On my visit to Bangalore last month, seemingly every person I passed on the street was focused on their smartphone — not just tech workers in India’s growing middle class, but street vendors and food hawkers, who looked more eager to accept payment from India’s version of Square than cold hard rupees. It’s one thing to know intellectually that India has replaced the U.S. as the world’s second largest smartphone market and that smartphone penetration is forecast to reach one in three of the 1.3 billion population this year, and another to see this burgeoning ecosystem first hand. Every time I return home to Cupertino, however, I’m just as amazed by how little Silicon Valley investors are focused on the Indian market. While most Sand Hill VCs frequently reference China’s WeChat or Tao Bao, they rarely mention PayTM or FlipKart (the PayPal and Amazon of India, respectively), which have nearly as many users. I suspect this is partly due to India’s startup industry being relatively small. In all candor, it’s also possible that some California investors have an unconscious blind spot to India, having pigeonholed the entire country by its outsourcing industry. This is a massive missed opportunity, especially with the arrival of mobile data plans in India with speeds rivaling even the best American carriers. To be sure, India’s smartphone market is significantly different from that of the U.S. or China and is heavily shaped by local policy and market history. Here’s a quick cheat sheet to start understanding the ecosystem. 1. Thanks to government intervention, digital payments are being widely adopted in India The growth of India’s smartphone market is partly due to the “Digital India” movement instituted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who devalued high currency notes late last year. This has posed a huge problem for India’s middle class, who typically use 500 and 1,000 rupee notes on a regular basis, but his goal was to curb money on the black market while also pushing Indians to use digital payments. PayTM, roughly the PayPal/Apple Pay of India, was not strongly succeeding until this policy shift. Now, even street vendors are rapidly adopting mobile payments. But digital payments require smartphones with data plans — which brings me to my next point: 2. Indians tend to be very price-conscious about mobile data consumption Up until very recently, mobile data usage on Indian smartphones operated on a “pay as you go” model, with carriers typically selling data as premium add-ons to their voice package. Consumers were hesitant to use their data unless absolutely necessary. People would use mobile data to check email and make quick digital payments, but not for entertainment. (Until, that is, they could access Wi-Fi from home or elsewhere.) All of this has greatly influenced adoption patterns for mobile apps. WhatsApp is much more popular in India than Facebook, in great part because WhatsApp data usage is more economical. Indians have also come to perceive online entertainment apps as something to do at home and/or connected to Wi-Fi but not while traveling or outdoors. It’s not that they don’t want to consume and share YouTube videos and other entertainment while on the road, just that the cost of doing so has been so prohibitive. For this reason, Snapchat, with its “share whatever you do, wherever you are” model, will probably not succeed in India in the short term; same goes for Periscope and other live streaming services. I wrote “short term” because something just changed in India: 3. Extremely fast broadband use is now catching on quickly Due to the cost concerns I mentioned, Indians have largely used data plans only for “useful” apps like payment services or ordering rides from Uber or the local incumbent, Ola Cabs. In fact, many would simply turn off their cellular data most of the time, enabling it only when absolutely needed. Then late last year, Reliance, one of India’s largest mobile carriers, took a different approach, launching its “Jio Mobile” service, offering free voice calls from anywhere to anywhere within the country — but also requiring that customers buy a data plan. This has created a huge adoption wave in India, with many migrating from AirTel (the local leader) to Reliance, the first carrier to start competing purely on data package. In response, AirTel and other carriers now offer competing plans. It’s important to emphasize how great these data plans can be. On my visit last month, I tested the data speed from Reliance Jio and was blown away to see it was 25 Mbps (on LTE) during non-peak time, and still around 5 Mbps during peak time. This is not only faster than in-home Wi-Fi speeds typical for India four years ago, it’s faster than my current AT&T plan in the U.S! You can probably see where I’m going with this: 4. This is the time for Western broadband-dependent apps to enter India Competition is causing rapid adoption of mobile data usage across India, which will keep driving prices down and broadband speeds up, quickly changing the Indian consumer’s attitude from “use data only when necessary” to “Kuchh masti waala dikhao!” (“Show me entertaining stuff”). Indian consumers will soon be hungry for app-based content that Western developers can easily provide — especially to the 125 million+ Indians who are already English-fluent. Apps like Netflix, Spotify, and Saavn (the Pandora of India) are likely to see much more usage on mobile. It’s still common for Indians to use DVD and thumb drives to watch videos while traveling, or play downloaded mobile games, but all that will soon change. We should also expect to see livestreaming services from journalists, reporters, and celebrities, all hugely popular on cable TV in India. “That’s interesting,” I already can imagine my Valley colleagues saying, “but how do we monetize it?” Which brings us to my final point: 5. App monetization in India: Less about IAP, more about carrier partnerships Since popular digital payment services are local, their usage probably won’t carry over soon to non-Indian, transaction-based apps such as Amazon or eBay. Similarly, in-app payments are still not very common in India, especially for companies or brands that consumers aren’t readily familiar with. Instead, it’s better not to directly charge consumers. For apps, the best strategy in India is to work with a mobile carrier and monetize through carrier billing. For instance, partner with a carrier to offer an app as part of a bundled, premium data package, and earn based on a revenue share. As I noted, data plan competition has become incredibly hot in India, so carriers are eager to add well-known apps to their plans. It’s possible I’m being too bullish about this market. But if India smartphone trends follow the U.S. and China, I doubt it. When I visit Bangalore next year, I fully expect to read about U.S.-India content partnerships coming to the country’s biggest mobile carriers. And when I’m back in California, I expect to hear from VCs angrily kicking themselves for not getting into India sooner.

Siri is the oldest of the bunch, and researchers including Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle, said Apple has squandered its lead when it comes to understanding speech and answering questions. But there is at least one thing Siri can do that the other assistants cannot: speak 21 languages localised for 36 countries, a very important capability in a smartphone market where most sales are outside the U.S. Microsoft Cortana, by contrast, has eight languages tailored for 13 countries. Google’s Assistant, which began in its Pixel phone but has moved to other Android devices, speaks four languages. Amazon’s Alexa features only English and German. Siri will even soon start to learn Shanghainese, a special dialect of Wu Chinese spoken only around Shanghai. Language hurdle The language issue shows the type of hurdle that digital assistants still need to clear if they are to become ubiquitous tools for operating smartphones and other devices. Speaking languages natively is complicated for any assistant. If someone asks for a football score in Britain, for example, even though the language is English, the assistant must know to say two-nil instead of two-nothing. At Microsoft, an editorial team of 29 people works to customize Cortana for local markets. In Mexico, for example, a published children’s book author writes Cortana’s lines to stand out from other Spanish-speaking countries. They really pride themselves on what’s truly Mexican. (Cortana) has a lot of answers that are clever and funny and have to do with what it means to be Mexican, said Jonathan Foster, who heads the team of writers at Microsoft. Google and Amazon said they plan to bring more languages to their assistants but declined to comment further. At Apple, the company starts working on a new language by bringing in humans to read passages in a range of accents and dialects, which are then transcribed by hand so the computer has an exact representation of the spoken text to learn from, said Alex Acero, head of the speech team at Apple. Apple also captures a range of sounds in a variety of voices. From there, an acoustic model is built that tries to predict word sequences. Then Apple deploys dictation mode, its text-to-speech translator, in the new language, Mr. Acero said. When customers use dictation mode, Apple captures a small percentage of the audio recordings and makes them anonymous. The recordings, complete with background noise and mumbled words, are transcribed by humans, a process that helps cut the speech recognition error rate in half. After enough data has been gathered and a voice actor has been recorded to play Siri in a new language, Siri is released with answers to what Apple estimates will be the most common questions, Mr. Acero said. Once released, Siri learns more about what real-world users ask and is updated every two weeks with more tweaks. But script-writing does not scale, said Charles Jolley, creator of an intelligent assistant named Ozlo. You can’t hire enough writers to come up with the system you’d need in every language. You have to synthesize the answers, he said. That is years off, he said. The founders of Viv, a start-up founded by Siri’s original creators that Samsung acquired last year, is working on just that.

"We are deeply a divided country," the iconic news anchor told CNNTech. "The digital divide, the divide about fear of the future, but also a general divide between the haves and the have nots. People in the technology sector are perceived to be among the haves." Rather, 85, spoke at SXSW Interactive on Friday, discussing the results of a global trust survey from Edelman. The marketing firm surveyed over 33,000 people in 28 countries and found that people are increasingly distrustful of media and government. And while people still largely trust the tech industry, they are concerned about how things like automation and globalization will affect the job market. According to the survey, 51% of people are concerned about the pace of innovation, while 22% consider themselves "fearful." The tech industry is centered in Silicon Valley -- home to Facebook, Google, Apple and Twitter, all major companies that play a role in people's daily lives. And yet they are perceived as being incredibly out of touch with much of America. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has gone on a campaign trail of sorts, visiting cities around the country to connect with people outside of the Valley. Rather says Zuckerberg reaching out to new communities and emphasizing his mission to "connect the world" is a direct response to the fears of people who perceive the tech world as elitist. In fact, he says, tech companies are increasingly promoting their feel-good missions as well as actual products, in order to regain people's trust and confidence. "It's a very steep hill to climb," Rather said. "[Many people's] minds are already made up, and unfortunately many people take the view, 'Don't bother me with the facts, my mind's made up.' It makes it more difficult to persuade them." Facebook was criticized after Zuckerberg said it was "crazy" that the company had any impact on the elections. (Thanks to filter bubbles and viral fake news, people rarely saw news they disagreed with on Facebook.) He later walked that claim back, but it was a reminder that technology isn't always ready to take responsibility for how its tools impact society. It's understandable why people might be afraid of technology -- in his farewell address, President Obama said the "relentless pace of automation" will drastically affect middle class jobs. And it's expected that at least five million jobs in the richest economies will be lost to automation by 2020. But tech can also create more opportunities. In Austin, which has banned Lyft and Uber, new ride-hailing companies have sprung up, giving drivers more flexibility -- and some even say more money. Drivers who didn't make enough money driving for Uber in Houston have even started making the two-hour trek to Austin to drive there. And yet Rather knows that this isn't enough yet. People are still afraid of the future -- and that only makes our divisions worse. "I believe this is rooted in the increasing fear that many in the general public of their being left behind. First we had the beginning of the digital divide in the late '80s or early '90s," Rather said. "Now when they look toward the future, such things like the robotization of America that's coming right down the line, their fears are exacerbated."

Kuo has made a name for himself as being one of the most reliable Apple analysts in the world, but today’s report focuses entirely on Samsung and corroborates a variety of details about what we’re expecting to see at the company’s Galaxy S8 media event on March 29th. Samsung U28E590D 28-Inch 4K Monitor Kuo, like others, predicts that there will be two size variants for the Galaxy S8, one model with a 5.8-inch display and 3000mAh battery and another with a 6.2-inch display and 3500mAh battery. Both are said to be OLED and feature WQHD+ resolutions of 2960×2400. The analyst predicts that the shipment split between the models will be 6:4. Furthermore, Kuo says that variants sold in the U.S., Japan, and China markets will be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 processor, while models sold in Europe and the rest of Asia will sport Samsung’s Exynos 8895 processor. Moving on to RAM, Kuo says that models sold in most markets will feature 4GB of RAM, while those sold in Korea and China will sport 6GB because “users in those two markets are particularly sensitive to DRAM specs. Kuo also offers up a handful of details regarding the design, which we’ve already seen numerous leaks of so far: (1) Full-screen display with no physical home button; (2) all models equipped with 3D-curved cover glass; and (3) six cutouts at the top front consist of a proximity sensor, ambient light sensor (ALS), IR-LED transmitter and receiver for iris recognition, front/ sub camera, and receiver. As for the back of the device, Kuo says the glass casing will be available in seven color options including gold, silver, bright black, matte black, blue, orchid, and pink. Kuo also notes that there will be four modules mounted next to each on the back: “a main camera (middle of the four), fingerprint scanner module (right), camera flash (top left), and heart beat measurement (bottom left).” The front camera is said to be 8MP, while the rear camera will be 12MP. Kuo pinpoints the lack of a two-camera design on cost and “immature dual-camera ISP design.” The Galaxy S8 will also reportedly feature a PC mode when placed in a dock, which is partially thanks to the support of USB-C and its higher-speed data transfer. As for availability, Kuo says the Galaxy S8 will go on sale on April 21st, contradicting earlier reports that had claimed the device will be delayed until April 28th. Kuo predicts shipments of 40 million to 45 million during 2017, which is slightly slower than the 52 million Galaxy S7 units that were shipped last year. Kuo attributes the slower sales to the fact that last year, the Galaxy S7 was essentially Samsung’s only flagship release of the year because of the Galaxy Note 7 debacle.

(QCOM) Stock and Trump the Bulls QCOM stock is gearing up for a leg lower. Profit with a well-placed spread. By Chris Tyler, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Mar 9, 2017, 10:51 am EDT     View All   Popular Posts: Sell Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Before the Rate Hike! Sorry, RBC. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is a Short Now. Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock Investors Should Bet on the Bears to Win Recent Posts: Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock: Goodbye, Not Good Buy Sorry, RBC. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is a Short Now. Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock Investors Should Bet on the Bears to Win View All Posts Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) saw a rare reprieve in Wednesday’s session. But traders may want to fade the modest cheer with a well-positioned, out-of-the-money put spread on QCOM stock. Source: Shutterstock After bearish jeers prompted by Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) litigation fired at Qualcomm several weeks back, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) offered QCOM stock investors some slight relief Wednesday. Shares of Qualcomm rallied 1.73% after it was learned that Qualcomm’s 10 nanometer Centriq 2400 processors will power certain Microsoft Azure cloud workloads as the company accelerates its cloud platform services. That’s potentially a problem for Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and the collaboration also shows Qualcomm’s commitment to an ARM-based server ecosystem. This could prove a boon in the future for QCOM stock, but there are no guarantees it will — and it certainly won’t happen overnight. Having said that, it’s our opinion there’s still a lot for QCOM stock to prove both off and on the price chart. QCOM Stock Weekly Chart Click to Enlarge When I last wrote about Qualcomm, our technical opinion was focused on the possibility for another leg higher. Shares were laterally consolidating around $66.50 and holding key support levels within an existing uptrend, while stochastics approached an oversold reading. QCOM stock did wind up rallying upward of 5% to fresh year-to-date highs, but then the trend turned aggressively bearish. An initial break of the up-channel support line was followed closely by Apple’s litigation news, which sent shares plunging lower deep into bear territory and where they remain today. The past few weeks have been spent digesting the large and technically destructive loss. Now and with the unwinding of the oversold condition in place, QCOM appears to be ready for a bearish continuation move lower. Admittedly, there is some support for higher prices. Stochastics have yet to confirm our view. Further, QCOM did hold the 62% retracement level and is now at its highest price since the January Apple-induced gap. Speaking of which, if Wall Street lore holds true, the gap is a sizable area to fill. Sometimes you just have to call a spade a spade. And for QCOM stock, this means respecting a bearish flag pattern in a stock much closer to 52-week and multi-year lows and well-positioned to challenge those lowly price levels in the coming months.

Additionally, the documents also show that the CIA has its sights set on vehicle control systems. According to a summary by Wikileaks, Apple‘s mobile platform was a massive target for the agency. “Despite iPhone’s minority share (14.5%) of the global smart phone market in 2016, a specialised unit in the CIA’s Mobile Development Branch produces malware to infest, control and exfiltrate data from iPhones and other Apple products running iOS, such as iPads. CIA’s arsenal includes numerous local and remote ‘zero days’ developed by CIA or obtained from GCHQ, NSA, FBI or purchased from cyber arms contractors such as Baitshop,” the whistleblowing group wrote. “The disproportionate focus on iOS may be explained by the popularity of the iPhone among social, political, diplomatic and business elites.” The latest Wikileaks documents shed light on the CIA’s malware, targeting Android, iOS and even smart TVs What about Android, then? Wikileaks says that a similar unit targets Google’s platform, adding that the agency had 24 “weaponised” zero-day vulnerabilities at its disposal. And yes, these hacks allowed the CIA to “bypass the encryption of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Weibo, Confide and Cloackman (sic) by hacking the ‘smart’ phones that they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied”. One of the more startling revelations was the CIA’s ability to hack into smart television sets, turning them into “covert microphones” in the process. “The attack against Samsung smart TVs was developed in cooperation with the United Kingdom’s MI5/BTSS. After infestation, Weeping Angel [the malware – ed] places the target TV in a ‘Fake-Off’ mode, so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on. In ‘Fake-Off’ mode the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the internet to a covert CIA server.” CIA hoarding zero-day security gaps? The Wikileaks summary claims that, as of October 2014, the agency was also looking at malware for vehicle control systems, ostensibly with assassinations in mind. Traditional desktop users were also a focus for the CIA, with Wikileaks claiming the agency was running a “very substantial effort” to infect Windows users. Mac, Linux and Solaris users weren’t left out of the cold either, with the agency developing “automated multi-platform malware attack and control systems”, according to the whistleblowing organisation. The organisation also noted that the CIA was “hoarding” vulnerabilities instead of disclosing them to manufacturers. This was despite the Obama administration’s assurance to the US tech industry that vulnerabilities found after 2010 would be disclosed.

Brian Feroldi (TMFTypeoh) Mar 11, 2017 at 9:06AM The recent bull market has pushed many growth stocks' valuations into the stratosphere. Thankfully, not every growth stock is priced for perfection. Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN), and Under Armour (NYSE:UA)(NYSE:UAA) all hold promising growth potential, yet are currently trading at attractive valuations. Here's why I'd happily buy any of them today. Image Source: Getty Images. The smartphone slump is over Skyworks Solutions is a leading manufacturer of radio frequency chips that help devices connect to the internet. While this company's stock has been rallying for several years now, it put investors on an unpleasant roller coaster ride in 2016. Shares were slammed over concerns that demand for smartphones was slowing. Those fears proved to be well-founded. The company went on to produced a series of earnings reports that saw its top line head in the wrong direction. That's not something growth investors wanted to see, leading many traders to hit the sell button. Thankfully, the worst of the smartphone slowdown appears to be over. When Skyworks reported fiscal first-quarter results in January, management predicted that revenue in the upcoming quarter would rise by 8%. Better yet, management credited its upbeat guidance to an "expanding product pipeline and accelerating design win momentum." That hints that its efforts to diversify its business away from Apple and Samsung -- which are two of its biggest customers -- are starting to pay off.  Looking ahead, investors have reasons to believe that the top-line growth is here to stay. Skyworks is well positioned to benefit from the "Internet of Things" trend. In addition, the rollout of 5G wireless technology also promises to be a massive tailwind. When adding in the potential for margin improvement and the company's habit of buying back stock, analysts believe that Skyworks' bottom line will grow by nearly 15% annually over the next five years. That's quite a fast growth rate for a company trading for less than 14 times forward earnings. New drugs to the rescue While long-term investors in biotech giant Regeneron Pharmaceuticals have enjoyed a phenomenal run, the company's recent performance hasn't been all that impressive. Shares are down more than 34% from their highs in 2015. What gives? You can blame the downfall on a number of factors. First, the company reported a handful of clinical setbacks in 2016 that gave investors pause. Next, the FDA rejected sarilumab -- a hopeful treatment for rheumatoid arthritis -- because of manufacturing concerns. Finally, the company is losing a legal battle with Amgen over its new cholesterol-busting drug, Praluent. When adding in slowing sales of its top-selling drug, Eylea, it's no wonder shares have headed in reverse. Despite all of the bummer news, I think there are reasons for optimism. First, Regeneron and Sanofi are slated to receive a go/no-go decision from the FDA in the coming weeks about their new eczema drug candidate, Dupixent. Many believe this drug holds blockbuster potential, so getting the green light could help to reignite investors' enthusiasm. Next, sarilumab should be resubmitted to the FDA soon now that the manufacturing issues are completed. Finally, while Eylea's state-side growth rates are stalling, the drug is still growing by double-digits overseas.  When added together, Regeneron offers reasons to believe that it is still a growth company. Market watchers appear to agree. Current estimates call for bottom-line growth of nearly 19% annually over the next five years. With shares trading for 25 times forward earnings estimates, I think this is a growth stock worthy of your capital. This growth story isn't busted The last year hasn't been kind to shareholders of Under Armour. The company's stock has shed more than half of its value after management took an ax to profit growth projections. The original forecast called for $800 million in profits by 2018, but the company has since abandoned that target. When adding in a holiday quarter that featured sales growth of just 12%, it is understandable why some investors fear that this growth story is over. Despite the pain, I refuse to give up on Under Armour. In fact, I think the huge sell-off is actually a great opportunity to get in.  Why am I still bullish? First, why sales growth was disappointing in the fourth quarter, there are a handful of factors that explain the slowdown. North American retail stores in general performed poorly during the holiday season, and 85% of Under Armour's revenue is derived stateside. That means the company isn't immune to the slowdown in retail. In addition, 2016 also featured a number of high-profile bankruptcies from retailers like Sport's Authority, Eastern Mountain Sports, Sports Chalet, and more. Those headwinds should abate in 2017, and a new partnership with Kohl's should also help to shore up the company's retail presence. Second, while overall results were weak, Under Armour did have a few pockets of strength. International sales were especially strong, rising 63% last year. That tells me that this brand has overseas appeal, which is most certainly a positive sign. Finally, the company's direct-to-consumer strategy also appears to be working. Revenue from this channel grew 23% last year and comprises 40% of total sales. Continued growth here could go a long way toward offsetting any future retail sales weakness.  While Under Armour's stock doesn't look classically cheap -- it never does -- I still think this company has enough growth potential left to more than justify an investment.  Brian Feroldi owns shares of Apple, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and Under Armour (A and C shares).

Government surveillance is in the news, again. The cycle started with President Trump alleging former President Obama “wire tapped” Trump Towers. The cycle continued when Wikileaks released a trove of documents relating to the Central Intelligence Agency’s hacking tools. Whether President Trump’s allegations have merit, or whether they are baseless should not matter. Whether the CIA spied on United States’ citizens or whether it did not should not matter. What should concern citizens is the government’s ability to spy on them. ADVERTISEMENT The government’s ability to spy on its citizens has two important potential impacts. The first impact is the government’s ability to circumvent various constitutional protections against warrantless searches and seizures. The second, and the less discussed, impact is on a citizen’s right to freedom of speech.   Consumers place confidence in the ability of a manufacturer, whether Apple, Google, or others, to secure electronic devices from prying eyes. Gone are the days when secure storage meant purchasing safes, lockboxes, or lockable file cabinets. Now, secrets are hidden within complex strings of ones and zeros. The most secure electronic systems cannot offer perfect privacy, but operate to obscure meaningful data better than the competition. Technology can help obscure meaningful information. Technology also provides government increased access to a citizen’s private life, habits, and private thoughts. Instead of serving warrants and physically searching houses, computers, and other tangible items, government officials can remotely install malware, access electronic devices and seize photographs, document files, and contact lists. The Vault 7 revelations, along with Edward Snowden’s prior leaks, demonstrate the government can remotely activate microphones and cameras embedded in electronic devices, including televisions. The government can turn all types of devices, including televisions, into spying tools. Assuming the government follows proper procedures, it has a number of options minimally to comply with Fourth Amendment warrant requirements if it invokes “national security” as an excuse for surveillance. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) provides the executive branch broad leeway when conducting surveillance for national security purposes. The first option permits the President to authorize warrantless surveillance in certain circumstances. The second options allows the Attorney General to authorize warrant applications in other circumstances. Both warrantless and warranted surveillance are classified. FISA requires the Attorney General to submit semi-annual reports to Congress. Those reports, though, do not need to contain detailed information. The reports need only list the total number of applications, the number of applications approved, and the criminal cases where information gathered is used. Technology does not just provide governments increased access to a citizen’s private information; it also provides the government the ability to conceal any unauthorized access. The government can spy on citizens without even the most savvy technology expert knowing. And if the government believes it can completely avoid detection, or make it look like a foreign government was behind a hack, why should it apply for warrants? After all, the government could attribute the information gleaned to other sources, just as it has with cell site simulators. Government surveillance relating to national security poses a unique threat compared to other criminal investigations. The president possesses significant authority to investigate foreign threats. The exercise of that authority, though, threatens U.S. citizens’ First Amendment freedom of speech rights. When conducting surveillance for national security purposes, it is likely the government will both record protected speech and will use its authority to monitor groups with politically incorrect viewpoints. Well before technology permitted widespread surveillance, Supreme Court Justice Powell wrote, “History abundantly documents the tendency of government—however benevolent and benign its motive—to view with suspicion those who most fervently dispute its policies. Fourth Amendment protections become more necessary when the targets of official surveillance may be those suspected of unorthodoxy in their political beliefs. The danger to political dissent is acute where the Government attempts to act under so vague a concept as the power to protect ‘domestic security.’” Government surveillance, of political right or political left groups, makes people think twice before speaking contrary to the political establishment. State surveillance of Black Lives Matter allegedly chilled members’ desire to engage in political discourse “about the issues of our time.” Similarly, surveillance of Trump officials was used to impeach the credibility of Lt. Gen. Flynn, attack Attorney General Sessions, and generally to delegitimize President Trump. Progressive groups, right leaning groups, and individuals in the government who threaten its power are equally subject to government surveillance and potential that surveillance will be used to silence their dissent. Government may use technological advances to operate on the edges of Constitutional permissibility. The threats government surveillance pose to First Amendment freedom of speech rights should overshadow any discussion on the propriety of the surveillance state, just as they did before the proliferation of modern technologies, such as the computer and smartphone.   The Fourth and First Amendments are inexorably linked. Ignoring one will threaten the other. In the words of Justice Powell, “The price of lawful public dissent must not be a dread of subjection to an unchecked surveillance power. Nor must the fear of unauthorized official eavesdropping deter vigorous citizen dissent and discussion of government action in private conversation. For private dissent, no less than open public discourse, is essential to our free society.” Jonathon Paul Hauenschild, J.D., is a technology policy analyst.

Luckily, people in New York won’t have to worry about missing a single minute of the college basketball tournament because plenty of bars and restaurants in the Big Apple will host viewing parties while airing the games on multiple screens. Not to mention, some establishments are expected to offer drink specials. Check out a list of New York City hot spots for watching all the March Madness games at below: Bill’s Bar & Burger If catching the games on a 190-inch projector isn’t enough to bring out the school spirit, then munching on $5 sliders and guzzling $15 pitchers should do the trick. Oh, and all the appetizers on Bill’s menu are half-price all day during the entire tournament. If that’s not ballin’ on a college budget, what is? Location: 16 West 51st St. Village Pourhouse Keg stands may be so junior year, but $120 coolers loaded with two dozen ice cold brews at Village Pourhouse may be the next best way to relive those frat house glory days during March Madness. The bar is also offering $30 domestic buckets and $14 pitchers for all beer-lovers every game day. Location: 64 3rd Ave. Sidebar: Everybody’s a winner after chugging down $14 pitchers, $30 domestic buckets and $120 coolers filled with two dozen domestic beers. If beer isn’t on the agenda, Sidebar is also offering $55 bottles of White Girl Rosé and $45 bubble buckets of prosecco to wash down that game day anxiety. Location:  118 E. 15th St. Boulton & Watt How about catching every angle of the court on seven TV screens, all while sucking down $7 drafts and $9 pickleback shots? Location: 5 Avenue A The Greyson Catch every foul before the ref even calls it while watching games on 44 TVs — that is if your eyesight is still in working order after throwing back a bucket of brew equipped with six Fireball shots for just $55. There will also be minikegs available for $45. And no need to worry about experiencing college-style hangovers the day after your favorite team wins because the Greyson is offering nacho and wing specials every day of the tournament to help soak up the booze.

Apple Pay Vs. Visa Checkout Vs. Masterpass Vs. Amazon Payments Vs. Facebook Payments Micron: The NAND Story (Seeking Alpha) The recent Wikileaks dump of classified U.S. Central Intelligence Agency documents has once again raised the debate over how the government should balance national security and Americans’ right to privacy. According to the leaks, the CIA has developed technology that can be used to hack into SAMSUNG (OTC: SSNLF) TVs, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhones and iPads, and PCs and other devices running Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)’s Windows operating system. Of course, the government says it would never use any of its capabilities to spy on American citizens. However, privacy advocates often compare the ever-increasing government surveillance capabilities to the rise of “Big Brother” from George Orwell’s book “1984.” Related Link: Here's Who's Getting A Tax Cut Under The New Healthcare Proposal (You're Probably Not Included) If the Wikileaks hack is, in fact, evidence that 2017 may be the real-life “1984,” perhaps the book can shed some light on what kinds of things Americans should be watching out for next. Here are a few plot points from the book that some argue may have already begun to come true. In "1984," the Brotherhood Party watches citizens wherever they go. This part of the plot is seemingly the closest to reality, according to the Wikileaks documents. While the government says it doesn't monitor citizens’ personal activities in their homes or on their phones, it certainly seems to have the capability to do so. In "1984," the government re-writes history and even manipulates the language in an attempt to stave off potential rebellion. While U.S. citizens still have full freedom of speech, the current administration’s use of “alternative facts” may be a red flag that the integrity of the media should be closely monitored. In "1984," the government prohibits sex and discourages individuality. Like all other elements of the story, how closely it applies to today’s situation in the United States is open to interpretation. The groundbreaking 2015 Supreme Court ruling in favor of gay marriage was certainly a step toward freedom of sexual expression and individuality. However, the recent bans on travelers from seven and then six Muslim-majority countries could be interpreted as a step in the opposite direction. The dramatic conclusion of “1984” involves government brainwashing citizens to get them to conform. In the book, the government turns the protagonist’s biggest fears against him in an attempt to get him to abandon his personal ideals. Once again, applying this element to today’s America is a matter of personal opinion. There’s no question that politicians in both parties have used fear tactics regarding terrorism, immigration, gun violence, employment, healthcare and even socioeconomic class warfare to scare voters into choosing sides. While politicians throughout the ages have always recognized that fear is a strong motivator, Americans concerned about governmental power may have taken note of just how much of the 2016 campaign season was devoted to stirring up fears. Is “1984” coming true in real life? Obviously there’s no way to answer that question definitively. But following the latest Wikileaks document dump, it seems reasonable for Americans to be concerned.

Microsoft updates Cortana iPhone app in bid to take on Apple's Siri - Irish Sun Issue 076/15 Irish Sun        http://www.irishsun.com   Ireland News Breaking International News Breaking Business News Breaking Sports News Dublin News Economics News Belfast News Breaking Internet News Web Site Development News Healthcare News Ireland News Utilities News Microsoft updates Cortana iPhone app in bid to take on Apple's Siri PanArmenian.Net Sunday 12th March, 2017 PanARMENIAN.Net - Microsoft on Friday, March 10 released a promised overhaul of its Cortana iPhone app, simplifying the way the AI assistant works on iOS and making it more practical as an alternative - or complement - to Apple's native Siri, AppleInsider says. The refreshed app loads faster, and defaults into listening for voice commands and questions. The homescreen can also display Google Now-style information cards on items like news, weather, traffic, package deliveries, and nearby restaurants. From most places in the app, tapping an icon in the lower-left will bring up "quick action" buttons for info and commands without speaking. In addition to news and weather, users can set and view alarms and reminders, check and organize meetings, and get help with the app. Microsoft has in fact redesigned how reminders work, along with the app's calling and texting functions. When asking search questions, the app will now provide full-page answers. Cortana is likely of less use to most iPhone owners than Siri, since Apple restrictions mean it Cortana can't be triggered outside of the app, and it doesn't hook into many native iOS services. It can however be handy for people who also use a computer with Windows 10, which has Cortana integrated. Microsoft first promised the update in December, saying it would rollout to iPhone owners in coming weeks. A recent report noted that Cortana is second to Siri in language support, offering 8 languages in 13 countries versus Siri's 21 in 36. Apple is believed to be preparing enhancements to Siri in time for this year's iPhones, but it's not clear what those might be.

March 17 is traditionally seen as the start of the Irish tourism season. Further, number of travelers from Boston and New York have increased this year along with significant increase from others like Orlando and Chicago, the airline’s Director of Communications, Declan Kearney said,  Kearney added, “Celebrating St Patrick’s Day in Ireland, particularly Dublin, is on the bucket list for many people all over the globe.” According to research conducted on behalf of Fáilte Ireland in 2016, over 105,000 out-of-state visitors attended the St Patrick's Festival in Dublin.

Big deal, you say? It cost $1.2 million and the company only plans to make 6 of them. Hardly news that will impact the world of the typical driver, right? It turns out, the EP9 is just the preface to what NIO has in mind. This week at the annual South By Southwest extravaganza, it offered a glimpse at what’s next — the NIO Eve, a sultry and seductive SUV style vehicle that is definitely not your father’s minivan. Details are few, although the company is talking about up to 600 miles of range (Take THAT, Elon!). What the Eve offers more than anything else is total connectedness for a seamless driving experience. Assuming anyone can actually afford one, the Eve is supposed to do for automobiles what the iPhone did for telephones. “Motorola and Nokia were the leaders in the market and had been building phones at that point for 75 or 80 years. Everybody thought ‘what does a Silicon Valley company no about building phones?,” says Padmasree Warrior, NIO’s U.S. CEO. “So Apple, when it made the iPhone didn’t just build a better phone, it created a smartphone that allowed you to connect to the internet. They changed the ‘chassis.'” Warrior is a superstar of the first order in the tech world. The former chief technology officer at Cisco Systems, in addition to running things for NIO in America she also sits on the board of directors of Microsoft. NIO expects to sell its first connected, autonomous driving car (which may or may not look like the Eve concept) in 2020. “Autonomous” is a relative term. According to Warrior, the NIO will have Level 4 self driving capability. “The car will be completely capable of driving itself in constrained environments. Initially we’re targeting solving the problem of commute that all of us face around the world,” she says. The Eve concept seats five and has a sliding door that moves forward to reveal a spacious, inviting interior. There is a work station that folds away when not needed. The steering wheel and pedals also fold away when not in use. There is an onboard digital assistant named NOMI waiting to satisfy the passengers’ every request. NIO is not planning to build its own factory, at least not right away. It says it will contract with others to manufacture cars to its specifications with the possibility of its own manufacturing facility some time in the future. The price? Warrior says “Directionally, we’re targeting the premium market for this vehicle.” In other words, it will cost about what a Tesla Model X costs. By the time 2020 gets here, the NIO Eve will have plenty of competition. Targeting the SUV segment is a smart idea, although one has to wonder precisely how large the market for premium vehicles that cost an average of $120,000 and up will be. Also, there is little doubt that Level 4 autonomy will be barely adequate in 2020. Elon Musk plans to have Level 5 fully autonomous cars on the road 2 years before then. Will the NIO Eve be a success? That’s impossible to say. The company does not seem to be on shaky financial ground the way Faraday Future is. It is being backed by investors such as Chinese internet service provider Tencent, Singapore based Temasek Holdings, Menlo Park based venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, and computer maker Lenovo. It gives the impression that it is being run by adults who know what they are doing compared to the juvenile bombast of Jia Yueting, the PT Barnum-like person behind Faraday Future, LeEco, and, to a lesser extent, Lucid Motors. Elon Musk is always asking other companies to build compelling electric cars. With NIO, he may get his wish.

Vergrößern Teilen und Details dpa Bild 2/2 - Dieser Rettungshubschrauber transportierte die verletzte Schauspielerin Gerit Kling ab 2 Samstag, 11.03.2017, 18:44 Schauspielerin Gerit Kling ist bei einem Schlittenhunderennen von Prominenten auf der Ostsee-Insel Usedom verunglückt. Es habe einen Unfall mit einem Security-Fahrzeug am Rand der Strecke gegeben, sagte Organisator und Schauspieler Till Demtrøder am Samstag der Deutschen Presse-Agentur. "Die Hunde haben leider einen falschen Weg gesucht." Gerit Kling habe noch abspringen wollen und sei dann unglücklich gelandet. Die 51-Jährige sei aber sofort wieder aufgestanden und dann als Vorsichtsmaßnahme mit einem Rettungshubschrauber in eine Klinik geflogen worden. Später kam von dort laut Veranstalter die Entwarnung: Gerit Kling habe ihrer Schwester Anja telefonisch berichtet, sie habe eine leichte Gehirnerschütterung, aber keine Brüche oder schwerwiegenden Verletzungen. "Es war eine sehr, sehr unglückliche Verkettung, die dazu geführt hat. Es tut mir sehr, sehr leid für Gerit", sagte Demtrøder. Rennen wie geplant fortgesetzt Nach dem Sturz sei die Schauspielerin bei Bewusstsein und ansprechbar gewesen. «Und ich habe sie auch gefragt, ob wir das Rennen fortsetzen sollen und dann hat sie gesagt: 'Ja, bitte fortsetzen und auf jeden Fall weitermachen'." Die 51-Jährige und ihre Schwester waren der Einladung ihres Kollegen Demtrøder zur zweiten Auflage der "Baltic Lights"-Veranstaltung gefolgt - ebenso wie etwa Didi Hallervorden, Jutta Speidel und Michael Mendl. Demtrøder betonte: "Wir haben hier ein hohes Maß an Sicherheitsmaßnahmen getroffen." Es fahre aber immer ein Restrisiko mit. Zuvor hatte die "Bild" über den Unfall berichtet. Nach dem Rennen der Prominenten wurde die Veranstaltung wie geplant mit dem Rennen der rund 40 Hundeschlittenführer – sogenannte Musher – und mehr als 300 Huskys fortgesetzt. Wegen des fehlenden Schnees zogen die Hunde Wagen mit Ballonreifen über die insgesamt sechs Kilometer lange Rennstrecke zwischen den Seebrücken Heringsdorf und Ahlbeck. Rund 35 000 Zuschauern säumten nach Schätzungen der Veranstalter bei Frühlingswetter die Strecke. beb/wen/dpa Vielen Dank! Ihr Kommentar wurde abgeschickt.

VW says your autonomous electric future car looks friendlier VW's design director says self-driving technology and car-sharing will drive more approachable-looking vehicles. Future Cars by Chris Paukert March 7, 2017 7:29 AM PST @cpautoscribe As Volkswagen stares down the same autonomous, pure-electric future mobility universe that most other companies are predicting, the German automaker sees a friendly face looking back at them. According to Volkswagen Design Director Klaus Bischoff, concept cars like the company's new Sederic pod and ID Buzz retro bus aren't friendly looking and inherently approachable by accident. They're part of a determined strategy to disarm motorists and pedestrians alike, to charm them with kindness. "We want to come out with a complete new design language for our electric mobility. We want to give the cars a more friendly, sympathetic appearance," Bischoff says. "They shouldn't be aggressive." In countless surveys, consumers have expressed more than just skepticism about self-driving cars. In some cases, the concept of autonomy has been met with outright fear. Putting a literal friendly face on future automobiles could help ease minds -- consciously or otherwise -- in much the same way that Apple made desktop PCs feel friendlier with iconography, rounded forms and bright colors back with the original iMac G3 of the late '90s. "We don't want to come up with grilles that you fear that the car eats you up. No man-eaters," Bischoff cautioned at a media roundtable at Tuesday's Geneva Motor Show. 39 Looking at the Volkswagen ID Buzz concept never gets old Bischoff sees design as being particularly important for electric cars, especially in the interim while they are generally costlier than conventional internal-combustion-powered models. "They have to be attractive, [consumers] have to spend a certain amount of money more on these electric vehicles, so there should be a good reason to purchase them. Design could help to attract customers." By virtue of their different packaging requirements, EVs present a new opportunity for designers to remake the faces of cars, in part because they don't require traditional grilles to offer cooling for radiators or other related hardware. But even if losing the hard points associated with engines, transmissions and cooling systems has given designers something of a blank slate, new autonomous sensors -- radar sensors, Lidar pucks and so on -- have conspired to create new baked-in hard points, or design borderlines. Vehicles designed with carsharing in mind will also demand different design solutions, in part because drivers "don't have an ownership relationship to the brand," notes Bischoff. That could suggest a blander, lowest-common-denominator aesthetic could take over. Indeed, despite some illuminated facial features for communicating with pedestrians, VW's box-like Sedric concept would appear to point to exactly this sort of appliance-pod-as-transport future. Bischoff points to the Sedric's spare, functional appearance as being a reflection of VW's German Bauhaus-inspired design aesthetic, but upon its presentation at the auto show, it struck me and a number of fellow auto journalists I spoke with as being cold and derivative. VW's autonomous Sedric uses illuminated, face-like gestures to communicate its actions. Volkswagen Of course, there are practical design considerations in this new age of autonomous EV design, too. The hidden door handles that automakers are becoming increasingly enamored with for the rear doors of today's four-door cars, for instance, will likely be a non-starter because carshare-service members may not intuitively know where to look for them. The same logic -- perhaps even more so -- applies to vehicle interiors, where simplifying the number of controls and streamlining interfaces will be key to not overwhelming unfamiliar passengers with complex control schemes. Ease of use and proper ergonomics will be of paramount importance, even more than today. Industry-watchers have long contended that automotive design mirrors national sentiment: The chrome-laden, pastel-painted befinned cars of the 1950s reflected the optimism of the atomic age and the space race. The cars of 2000s have been characterized by aggressive scowling front ends and high waistlines with gun-slit windows, perfect for the inward-turning, protectionist mindset fostered by our post-9/11 society. By that logic, the promise of emissions-free mobility for all would certainly seem to support the idea of shiny, happier-faced automobiles, but motorists and pedestrians alike are going to have to get comfortable with the idea of self-driven cars first. This time, car design may have to help drive cultural sentiment, not just reflect it.

TrendsViral, WikiLeaks CIA files The malware, or ‘rootkit’, is designed to allow access to parts of a computer where it typically wouldn’t be allowed and can hide the existence of other activities. In response to Tuesday’s #WikiLeaks dump we have released a detection tool for EFI rootkits: https://t.co/mYmEtZieKB via @pcworld— McAfee (@McAfee) March 10, 2017 Read more WikiLeaks will give tech companies exclusive access to CIA #Vault7 hacking tools - Assange (VIDEO) According to the leaked data, the CIA created Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) rootkits to hack into Apple Macbooks. The malicious software can allegedly embed itself in a computer’s low-level firmware and runs as the system is booting up. It is also coded to survive system updates, reinstallations, and can restore malware that gets removed. In response to the WikiLeaks release, Intel Security’s Advanced Threat Research team has created a new module for its existing CHIPSEC open-source framework that can detect the rogue EFI. The module can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Speaking to RT this week, John McAfee, the creator of McAfee, which is now Intel Security, said that the CIA is failing in its mandate to protect the American people, likening its practices to withholding penicillin from someone who is sick.

Early signs are promising, the Switch has already smashed Nintendo’s first week sales records in the US and Europe, while The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the most successful Nintendo launch title ever, beating even Super Mario 64. Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy-Con Nintendo Switch with Neon Blue and Neon Red Joy-Con SKU Details Buy Now At Amazon $496.21 So should you buy a Switch right now, or should you wait? One thing you absolutely should do is enter our competition to win one for yourself, so read on to find out how. A Portable Home Console Hybrid You get a lot of things in the box when you buy a Nintendo Switch, starting with the console itself, two Joy-Con controllers, and a dock. You’ll also find a USB type-C power adapter How to Buy a USB-C Cable That Won't Destroy Your Devices How to Buy a USB-C Cable That Won't Destroy Your Devices A few months ago, Amazon banned USB-C cables that did not meet the standards set forth by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF), and for good reason: such cables are prone to failure, can damage connected... Read More , two rails for attaching the Joy-Con to your wrist, a grip that turns the Joy-Con into a more traditional controller, and a rather short HDMI cable. The tablet is the brains of the operation, with all the important hardware hidden behind a shiny 6.2 inch IPS panel with a native resolution of 720p (1280 x 720). Even with the Joy-Con connected it’s lighter than the Wii U Gamepad How to Use a Wii U Gamepad With a PC How to Use a Wii U Gamepad With a PC The classic Wii U gamepad can be used to play games on Windows . . . and it's a lot easier than it sounds. Read More , though much slimmer and more pleasant to use. It’s a smart design, with solid metal rails for the Joy-Con to slide into, finished with the same matte plastic found on the controllers. On the top edge of the device is a recessed power button, volume rocker, a fan vent through which you can see a heatsink, a standard 3.5mm stereo jack, and the game card slot. Nintendo has embraced the game cartridge this time round, opting for small SD card-like bits of plastic. Unfortunately pulling open the game card flap doesn’t feel great, and I thought I was breaking it the first time I did it. On the back of the device you’ll find some Nintendo branding, two air vents, and a flimsy kickstand. The kickstand might be the worst part of the whole console, and never seems to close properly once opened. To its credit Nintendo designed it to be replaceable, and it cleverly hides the microSD card slot on the underside too. The bottom edge of the device is where you’ll find the USB type-C connection, for charging and connecting to a TV via the dock. The included controllers, or Joy-Con as Nintendo has called them, offer several ways to play. In handheld mode they slide into the rails either side of the main tablet, which is a painless ordeal. Getting them off using the small buttons on the rear can be a little tricky the first time you try it, but you get used to it. Once detached you can use the Joy-Con in either hand like a “Wiimote and Nunchuk” combination, or slide them into the grip which more closely resembles a regular game controller. Certain games allow you to use one Joy-Con each, providing an analogue stick and six buttons (four face, two shoulder), which is cramped but works just fine. The controllers are perhaps a touch on the small side, but that’s the way Nintendo had to go to keep things portable. There’s quite a jump to get from the ABXY buttons to the right analogue stick, and hitting both triggers while resting on the right-analogue stick can take some getting used to. Despite this the buttons are satisfyingly clicky and the analogue sticks are a joy to use, though there’s no proper d-pad this time round. Another feature that Nintendo has hyped is the addition of HD Rumble, haptic-based feedback like you’ll find on the latest smartphones iPhone 7 Plus Review & Giveaway iPhone 7 Plus Review & Giveaway This year's iPhone 7 models break with convention. For the first time ever Apple has opted for the same general design three years in a row, while introducing some divisive, but long-overdue features. Read More . It’s the sensible evolution of force feedback, but not as revolutionary as Nintendo led us to believe. I’ve played the “balls in a box” 1-2-Switch tech demo mini game, and yeah it feels good, but beyond that I’ve not encountered anything particularly revolutionary. Finally the dock is a big hunk of black plastic which sits somewhere near your TV, allowing you to charge your console and play on the big screen. It’s a cheap and hollow-feeling stand made from rough plastic, which connects to the system via USB type-C at the bottom. The dock houses no real hardware, instead it tells the system to harness the additional power and increase clock speeds to achieve higher resolutions on the big screen. Switch in Use When you first turn the system on you’ll be invited to create a user account, but without the online push you’d expect from Sony or Microsoft Xbox Live Versus PlayStation Plus: What Do You Get With Each? Xbox Live Versus PlayStation Plus: What Do You Get With Each? Let’s see which provides the best bang for your buck. Read More . You only need to create or link a Nintendo account when you finally launch the eShop, probably because the Switch’s online service is still six months away from completion. Overall the system feels speedy, like a new piece of hardware should. There’s no Wii-like grid layout, and only two themes to choose from: light and dark. They’re dull, sure, but the addition of a night-friendly UI is great for playing in bed without blinding yourself. You’ll need to patch your Switch to use online features and fix a few bugs, but the jump to system version 2.0.0 took mere seconds to download and install. If you’re playing retail games, all of the data is stored on the cartridge and there’s no need to install anything to the internal storage. It’s a breath of fresh air in an age where buying, installing, and updating a new game seems to take an age. You’ll still need to download patches however, which are installed to microSD if you have one. Games look great on the native 720p tablet display. With no upscaling, the pixel density of 237 ppi results in a crisp image, and during my time playing Breath of the Wild I only encountered a brief moment of slowdown while undocked. Handheld mode really does deliver a home console experience in a small package, and image quality is unchanged beyond the resolution bump. Playing the same game in docked mode results in the console rendering a 900p image, which is then upscaled to 1080p Upscaling: How Does It Work and Is It Worth It? Upscaling: How Does It Work and Is It Worth It? Read More . Things aren’t as sharp as a result, and I encountered more slowdown in some areas while docked to the TV. These frame-rate problems are hard reproduce, which makes me wonder whether the problem is down to the CPU rather than GPU — possibly a result of porting Wii U software to a different architecture? One thing that struck me while thinking about upcoming releases is how nice it is for Nintendo to finally deliver a unified control scheme for the first time in years. There’s no need to repurpose your old Wiimotes, buy Nunchuks, charge the Gamepad, or buy a Pro controller unless you really want to. Split Joy-Cons might be the best way to play any game on the system, while in Handheld mode things feel good if a little cramped. Your portable mileage is going to vary depending on hand size and the game you’re playing. I have big hands, I’ve been playing lots of Zelda, and I’ve still spent 75% of my time with the console in handheld mode. Battery life might hold you back though. The best I’ve managed is around three hours of Zelda on a single charge before plugging in, but you can use standard USB power banks Best Pokemon Go Power Bank Best Pokemon Go Power Bank Pokemon Go beats the heck out of a phone's battery. Squeezing a bit more Pokemon-catching juice out of your phone requires a power bank. But what's the best battery out there? Read More to charge your console. Just make sure it can handle 5 volts at 2.6 amps (13w) if you intend to charge and play simultaneously. Lower power banks will work, but you’ll still deplete your battery (albeit slowly) if you can’t meet the 13 watt requirement. Fun But Flawed Nintendo has a habit of improving hardware iteratively, and they’ve got some issues to fix with the Switch. Some of these problems are purely software-based, while others suggest that the company is already working on a revised model for release in future. Let’s not kid ourselves here: Nintendo shipped the Switch with unfinished software, missing several key features. The premium online service might be the most visible problem here, but the biggest single issue is that there is presently no way to transfer or backup save data. It’s all stored on the internal memory, without any option of backing up to the cloud or microSD card. This needs to be fixed. Better data management in general would allow you to transfer game data (updates, DLC) from the paltry 32GB internal memory to a microSD card of your choice, without having to delete it first. Even if backing up to the cloud is coming as part of the upcoming premium online service, six months is a long time to wait for such basic functionality as this. There’s no support for Bluetooth headphones or headsets either, which is odd considering the Switch uses Bluetooth to communicate with its controllers. With the technology already in place, it’s nice to imagine a software update could add support for this, but there are no guarantees. Other issues come down to the hardware itself, with the potentially most damaging being a design flaw with the dock. Users are reporting that the rough plastic against which the tablet rests is actually scratching the screen, so a screen protector (ideally a tempered glass one) is a must if you’re concerned. The screen itself is plastic, which is another baffling design choice made presumably to save money, which results in an easily-scratchable display. I’ve not got a single scratch on the screen of my Switch yet, but I’ve been extra careful when docking it. Be wary of “fixes” that involve putting fabric on the dock — it’ll trap more dirt, which means more scratches, and may cause the console to overheat. The other handful of issues might not bother you. Sound quality isn’t great via the built-in speakers, it’s comparable to an iPhone 7 in terms of volume but not clarity. Battery doesn’t last as long as you’d probably like, but the same can be said for most lithium-ion powered devices. Lastly the Switch itself can feel a bit like a money pit: it begs to be put in a case, you’ll need a microSD card, there’s an optional Pro controller to buy, you’ll probably want a spare charger or USB cable, maybe a portable battery if you’re really hammering it. Then there are the games, which cost as much as any other platform. Your reasonably priced console can quickly become very pricey indeed. Win a Nintendo Switch and Zelda! Before we deliver our verdict, enter below for your chance to win a Nintendo Switch and copy of Zelda. Nintendo Switch Giveaway Should You Buy One? Despite there being room for improvement, the problems shouldn’t overshadow what Nintendo has achieved here. With the best launch game of any recent generation, and an innovative hybrid approach, there’s a lot to love about the Nintendo Switch even at this early stage in the game. Fortunately many fixes and features can be added with software updates, while others will have to wait for a hardware revision. It’s up to developers to address some of the other concerns: a lack of games, those first party system sellers, and finding innovative uses for the tech on-offer. The important thing is that the Switch shows promise, even in its unfinished state. Neither home or portable use feels like a gimmick: it’s not a glorified portable as per the Super Game Boy, but it’s not a home console with a low-fat portable option either. It actually excels at both tasks, even if it is underpowered compared to the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. It’s what the Wii U should have been all along. Our verdict of the Nintendo Switch: If you can live with unfinished software and a few bad design choices, the Switch and a copy of Breath of the Wild is a compelling purchase. A revision will ultimately fix some of the design complaints, but you could be waiting a while.710 Previous PostLiberate Bolivia in Ghost Recon Wildlands With These 7 Beginner TipsNext Post5 of the Best Skateboarding Games Ever Made 15 comments Write a Comment Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The refreshed app loads faster, and defaults into listening for voice commands and questions. The homescreen can also display Google Now-style information cards on items like news, weather, traffic, package deliveries, and nearby restaurants. From most places in the app, tapping an icon in the lower-left will bring up "quick action" buttons for info and commands without speaking. In addition to news and weather, users can set and view alarms and reminders, check and organize meetings, and get help with the app. Microsoft has in fact redesigned how reminders work, along with the app's calling and texting functions. When asking search questions, the app will now provide full-page answers. Cortana is likely of less use to most iPhone owners than Siri, since Apple restrictions mean it Cortana can't be triggered outside of the app, and it doesn't hook into many native iOS services. It can however be handy for people who also use a computer with Windows 10, which has Cortana integrated. Microsoft first promised the update in December, saying it would rollout to iPhone owners in coming weeks. A recent report noted that Cortana is second to Siri in language support, offering 8 languages in 13 countries versus Siri's 21 in 36. Apple is believed to be preparing enhancements to Siri in time for this year's iPhones, but it's not clear what those might be. Related links: AppleInsider.

New Waymo/Otto lawsuit covers alleged lidar infringement in details - and drops this bombshell pic.twitter.com/yXGiYQWxod — Mark Harris (@meharris) March 11, 2017   The fight is also shaping up as a rematch of legal titans from another case that riveted Silicon Valley — the smartphone patent battle between Apple and Samsung. Morrison Foerster, which represents Apple in that case, on Friday said it would represent Uber in the suit by Alphabet. Alphabet is represented by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, which also represents Samsung. Waymo sued Uber last month over allegations that a former employee downloaded and stole more than 14,000 confidential files, including details on light-detection and ranging sensor technology known as LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). Uber has denied the claims. It did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. LIDAR systems are similar to radar and shoot light beams to map out a street or environment. They are a crucial element of most self-driving car systems. Waymo, which originally said that two LIDAR patents were infringed, on Friday in an amended complaint added a third patent. It also said that Uber infringed unpatented trade secrets, such as parameters and measurements for the light beam used in LIDAR. It also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on the LIDAR technology in question.

Even though it has preferred to buy comparatively smaller start ups; or develop technology on its own, this acquisition comes off as one of its biggest moves. Harman is an auto and audio company; which is known for its audio division; namely Harman Kardon. The initial announcement of this deal was done at Samsung Electronics’ South Korea office in Seoul; during a news conference on 21 November, 2016. Samsung confirmed tonight that the deal is done. Samsung Acquires Harman for $8 Billion Image - Samsung Headquarters at Seoul, South Korea The acquisition of this auto giant is the biggest in the history of Samsung. Typically the Seoul company develops its technology in-house; which is why this move comes as an unusual one. However, the acquisition of Harman by Samsung will make the tech giant a bigger player; in the autonomous industry. Currently, this industry is dominated by tech companies like Apple and Google; and automaker companies like GM (General Motors), Tesla and Volvo. Dinesh Paliwal, the President of Harman said that; Samsung will provide Harman a platform, various technologies and a scale to accelerate their growth. This way, both the companies will also be able to extend their global market leadership; in the automotive and smart audio technologies. Additionally, Dinesh mentioned that; both the companies together, will define and drive the future of automotive industry. A Growth Booster Acquisition by Samsung Interestingly, a point worth noticing is that Harman is the parent company of Infinity, JBL, Mark Levinson and Lexicon; along with its Harman Kardon brand. At a time in the market, when Google is working on its Android Auto and Waymo; and Apple is working on CarPlay, this joint effort may prove to be beneficial for both the giants. This move will also boost the technologies and market of Samsung’s smart home devices and other connected devices. Additionally, as per the terms of this agreement; the stockholders of Harman will receive $112.00 per share, in cash. Young Sohn, the President and CSO (Chief Strategy Officer) of Samsung Electronics said that; the close of this deal opens a new door to create growth opportunities; along with the potential to deliver major benefits for their customers worldwide. Harman Continues to Operate as Samsung’s Subsidiary Furthermore, after this deal; the common stock of Harman will cease trading before the market opens on 13 March. In connection to the acquisition, it will also be delisted from the NYSE (New York Stock Exchange). Harman will continue operation as a standalone subsidiary of Samsung; whose Board of Directors panel will be led by Young Sohn. Continuing as the CEO of Harman, Paliwal will lead this company along with his management team; and he will also keep serving as a member of its Board. Samsung will retain Harman’s staff; its headquarters and all of its consumer and professional audio brands also.

Shari Puterman , sputerman@theadvertiser.com Share This Story 6,255 Tweet Share Share Pin Email Comment “Sutton is her mom, right down to the hair on her head. Her personality … she’s sassy, sweet, lovable and thankful … and she’s not scared of anything. A daredevil, just like her mama. And I will be right by her side, like I was with Megan. We will go however big we have to go.” Amy Alvarez, 45, speaks of her daughter, Megan, and granddaughter, Sutton, with great pride, as most mothers do. Megan will wear her Gatsby-inspired dress for eternity. She was going to wear it for her vow renewal last month. (Photo: COURTESY OF TEAMMEG) She reflects on their beauty, enthusiasm and incredible resemblance to one another, in every sense of the word. And millions of people agree. On Nov. 29, 2016, Megan Zipperer lost her life after battling cervical cancer that spread to her stomach and lungs. In the months leading to her death, the 25-year-old mother of three opened up to the world, sharing intimate moments of her journey through Facebook videos and inspiring millions with her unwavering faith. MEGAN'S FULL STORY: Mom's deadly cancer battle ignites world of hope People from all walks of life have been touched by Megan’s remarkable family, which includes her husband River, 27, and their three children, Sawyer, Kellan and Sutton. Her supporters, dubbed TeamMeg, are committed to changing the world by keeping her memory alive, and this past Sunday, something very special happened. Megan’s daughter Sutton, almost 3, lit up the world in a way that’s sure to keep her mother’s legacy shining bright for years to come. Mommy's 'mini-me' Megan always stood out from the crowd. As a baby, she entered and won the Sunburst beauty pageant in Lake City, Florida, and as a teenager, loved being in front of — and behind — the camera. Megan was scouted by Hollister as a teenager but too young to sign a contract. (Photo: COURTESY AMY ALVAREZ) “At 15, she got serious,” her mother recalls. “She wanted to go to New York City and become a model.” Although Megan never hit the Big Apple, she pursued her dream, and by the time she turned 16, a golden opportunity landed in her lap. “I was shopping,” Amy says, “and Megan called me. She said, ‘I’m at a Hollister casting call in Gainesville, and they really want me, but they need to call corporate for approval because I’m not 18.’ She told me I might need to write something giving my permission, and I said, ‘If that’s what you want to do, I will do whatever it takes.’ They called corporate, and the casting director and photographer both wanted her … they said she was so natural.” Unfortunately, age restrictions prevented Megan from signing with the brand, but they told her to come back when she turned 18. Ultimately, though, bigger goals took precedence. A model mother Megan always dreamed of becoming a mother, and once she started having children, that was her life. When her firstborn child,  Sawyer, was 1, Megan had her last modeling shoot. Sutton Zipperer, aka "the standing baby." (Photo: COURTESY AMY ALVAREZ) “She and River decided that being a mama was the priority,” Amy recalls. Megan, a “girly girl” to the fullest, soaked up motherhood with every moment. She always dreamed of having a daughter to pamper, and ironically, doctors thought her son, Sawyer, was going to be a girl. Megan was so excited, she painted the entire room with pink glitter, and kept it that way for much of the pregnancy, even after doctors corrected their mistaken prediction. Life was amazing for the young family. Megan went on to have a second son before giving birth to her daughter, Sutton, on Feb. 11, 2014.  Although Megan loved her boys more than life itself, she was thrilled to have a daughter. “Megan had a closet jam-packed with clothes and shoes,” Amy says. “Right away, she got Sutton into modeling.” At the time, River, who worked as a certified welder, was located in Slidell and while there, Megan started networking. “She would dress Sutton in all these clothes, stand her up and take pictures,” Amy recalls. “People started noticing.” Beautiful bonding Sweet Honey Clothing, an online boutique, dubbed Sutton “the standing baby,” and began featuring her on their website. Sutton has a knack for "doing her own thing" in front of the camera. (Photo: COURTESY AMY ALVAREZ) Much like in her mother’s case, the world quickly fell in love. Before long, Sutton was modeling for several brands, including Pip Squeak's Boutique, The Happy Unicorn, Sparkle Bowtique, Deeley Anne Designs, Pink Piccadilly, Sweet Southern Sass Boutique and B405 Boutique. While all this was happening, Megan started her own online business called Button’s and Bling, where she specialized in Swarovski crystal-encrusted tennis shoes. Both she and Sutton worked regularly with boutiques around the country, and Megan loved bonding with her baby girl over their shared love for beauty. WATCH: Megan talks to her fans on Facebook “That was a little special thing that her and Sutton had together,” Amy says. Unfortunately, when Megan got the news in October that her cancer was terminal, she could no longer dedicate the energy to Sutton’s modeling, so everything was put on hold. But now, Amy’s found the strength to pick up where her daughter left off: Sutton has officially returned to the "catwalk." (See the full photo gallery below) “I want to carry that on,” she says. “I am in no way like her mother, but if I can do a little something to carry that on for Megan and Sutton … that’s what Megan wanted.” Always a guardian angel To get started, Amy reached out to Megan’s Facebook family, which now numbers in the millions. Sutton returned to modeling last Sunday. (Photo: C'Mone Kenyana Photography) “After River and I decided to go for it, I wrote a post that I had a special project in mind, and so many people reached out,” she says. Sutton embodies her mother in every way. (Photo: C'Mone Kenyana Photography) This past Sunday, Sutton happily made her return to modeling with a photo shoot by C'Mone Kenyana Photography. Wardrobe and accessories were provided by Pip Squeak’s Boutique, Deeley Anne Designs and a TeamMeg supporter in the UK. Sutton was over the moon. She even sent her dad this video while getting ready. “She wanted her nails done, her hair done,” Amy says. “She was saying, ‘Yayyy!’ That’s her thing when she gets excited. I was scared, though. I didn’t know what Megan did with her, or how Sutton was gonna act. It was really a test run, but she got out there, got in it and did her own thing.” SEE THE PHOTOS: See 18 amazing photos of Sutton and Megan There’s no doubt that Megan was watching over her baby girl during her first photo shoot alone. “It was raining, and I prayed for a break in the weather,” Amy says. “All of a sudden, it stopped, and we got it all done before the rain started up.” With Sutton’s sassy smile, Megan’s presence is never far away, and Amy is committed to keeping that smile bright for as long as she can. “I’m gonna keep going as long as Sutton wants to,” she says. “And I will be right by her side, like I was with Megan. We will go however big we have to go.” For this family, the possibilities are endless, and the world is rooting for them every step of the way. Megan was determined to change the world with her story — and Amy recalls a little-known memory that signaled big things on the horizon for her girl. “When Megan was 13 she went to Europe for several weeks, on a study-abroad trip,” she explains. “Most people don’t know this. She went to Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Paris. She stayed for a week with a family from Austria. I was terrified — I cried. But not Megan … she wasn’t scared at all. Sutton is a daredevil just like her mama. She’s not scared of anything.” Sutton "did her own thing" during her first shoot back in the modeling world.  (Photo: C'Mone Kenyana Photography) Fullscreen Sutton embodies her mother in every way.  (Photo: C'Mone Kenyana Photography) Fullscreen A typical Sutton "sassy" face.  (Photo: C'Mone Kenyana Photography) Fullscreen Sutton returned to modeling last Sunday.  (Photo: C'Mone Kenyana Photography) Fullscreen Megan was scouted by Hollister as a teenager but too young to sign a contract.  (Photo: COURTESY AMY ALVAREZ) Fullscreen Sutton poses for a shoot before her mother passed away.  (Photo: COURTESY AMY ALVAREZ) Fullscreen Sutton Zipperer, aka "the standing baby."  (Photo: COURTESY AMY ALVAREZ) Fullscreen Sutton's return to modeling was very meaningful.  (Photo: C'Mone Kenyana Photography) Fullscreen Sutton was known as "the standing baby."  (Photo: COURTESY AMY ALVAREZ) Fullscreen Sutton models with one of her favorite props, Minnie Mouse.  (Photo: COURTESY AMY ALVAREZ) Fullscreen Sutton embraces her sassy side.  (Photo: COURTESY AMY ALVAREZ) Fullscreen Sutton always loved the camera.  (Photo: COURTESY AMY ALVAREZ) Fullscreen Sutton has her mother's sassy and sweet sides.  (Photo: COURTESY AMY ALVAREZ) Fullscreen Megan gives her daughter a kiss for the camera.  (Photo: COURTESY AMY ALVAREZ) Fullscreen Sutton has a knack for "doing her own thing" in front of the camera.  (Photo: COURTESY AMY ALVAREZ) Fullscreen Megan and her daughter, Sutton, had a special bond over beauty.  (Photo: COURTESY AMY ALVAREZ) Fullscreen Sutton has modeled since she was a baby.  (Photo: COURTESY AMY ALVAREZ) Fullscreen One of Sutton's shoots before her mother passed away.  (Photo: COURTESY AMY ALVAREZ) Fullscreen Like this topic?

This move follows the lawsuit Waymo filed back in February against Otto, a self-driving truck startup, and Uber, the startup's parent company. The case argues that the defending party has stolen more than 14,000 confidential documents, including info for LiDAR or Light Detection and Ranging. However, Uber rebuffed the accusations at the time, calling them "baseless," according to Business Insider. Waymo's Request To The Court In court, Waymo security engineer Gary Brown testified, and he pointed out that based on Google network logs, Otto cofounder Anthony Levandowski, who was formerly a Google software engineer, downloaded secret files related to Waymo's self-driving car project, including but not limited to schematics and blueprints. The stolen data reportedly amounts to a total of 9.7 GB. More than that, Brown embroiled Radu Raduta and Sameer Kshirsagar, who are also accused of downloading confidential data from Google. They are said to have left the company and followed Levandowski at Otto and Uber soon after doing so. Reuters says the legal battle between Waymo and Uber is starting to become similar to the courtroom showdowns of Apple and Samsung. On an interesting note, it reports that Morrison & Foerster, Apple's representative back then, will represent Uber; while Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, the firm that represents Samsung, will represent Waymo's parent company Alphabet. "Competition should be fueled by innovation in the labs and on the roads, not through unlawful actions. Given the strong evidence we have, we are asking the court step in to protect intellectual property developed by our engineers over thousands of hours and to prevent any use of that stolen IP," Waymo says (via TechCrunch). As for Uber's response to the allegations, The Verge says that a representative of the ride-hailing service confirmed that the company is reviewing the recent motions and they called the lawsuit "baseless" yet again. LiDAR is considered to be an essential factor for the early future of self-driving technology. It's a sensor that uses lasers to detect surrounding objects and measure distance to produce a 3-D map. Quick Timeline Of Related Events As a recap, Levandowski departed from Google back in January 2016 and cofounded Otto. Soon after, the startup was acquired by Uber for $680 in August 2016. In September 2016, Uber began testing its self-driving car project in Pittsburg. The Bottom Line Lately, things haven't been looking good for Uber. Namely speaking, there are the issue with the tool used to bypass regulators called Greyball, the heated argument between CEO Travis Kalanick and an Uber driver, and the resignation of Vice President of Product and Growth Ed Baker and Senior Vice President of Engineering Amit Singhal. With the legal bout with Waymo, Uber won't be stepping out of the woods in the foreseeable future just yet. If you have an opinion regarding the matter, feel free to leave a comment below.

New regulations on mobile phone for drivers have been introduced that will see offenders given six penalty points and a £200 fine. The new rules also mean that any motorist caught using their phone within the first two years of driving could have their licence revoked as a result. But what about a trip to the drive-thru? It's all to do with how you pay for your food. Do you use Apple Pay? If you do, you may have to stop using it. MORE: McDonald's home delivery service could be coming to Somerset bringing a Big Mac to your doorstep Are you breaking the law? The point was raised by Jay Chase on Twitter, who asked Greater Manchester Police (GMP) Traffic if he could use Apple Pay while at a drive-thru. GMP Traffic replied: "If your engine is off and your handbrake applied and you're parked yes. "If your engine is on NO." It is illegal to use a hand-held phone or similar device while driving and the rules are the same if you are stopped at traffic lights or queuing in traffic. UK law states that you can only use your phone in a vehicle if you need to call 999 in an emergency and it is unsafe or impractical to stop. If caught using your phone behind the wheel, you could end up with six penalty points on your licence and a £200 fine.

Diners in Upland restaurant on Park Avenue took pictures of the former US president and his wife as they sat down with the Irish rock band singer and his 27-year-old tech entrepreneur daughter, Jordan Hewson.   Watch | Obamas receive standing ovation when visiting a restaurant in New York 00:38 One of the California-inspired restaurant’s patrons was caught on video shouting “We love you Obama!”, and the whole restaurant stood up and applauded the couple as they left, according to People magazine. Mr Obama received a similar reaction on an outing in the Big Apple last month, attracting a crowd of hundreds as he entered an office building in Manhattan. Barack and Michelle’s eldest daughter is currently living in New York while interning at The Weinstein Company. The 18-year-old is due to start at Harvard University this autumn. This was not the first time that Barack Obama and the activist musician had met - official White House photographer Pete Souza recently shared a snapshot of Bono serenading Mr Obama on a visit there in 2011. Mrs Obama and her daughters also had lunch with Bono in 2013 during the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland. It seems that Mr Obama has been enjoying his time out of the political limelight. Billionaire Virgin businessman Richard Branson shared a video of Mr Obama kitesurfing on holiday in the British Virgin Islands. Watch | Barack Obama makes an appearance in New York 00:35 Michelle Obama has also been busy this week: aside from the trip to New York, she also surprised a group of schoolgirls at Washington DC’s Cardozo High School for International Women’s Day.

(Reuters/Larry Downing) Share Written by Dave Gershgorn Obsession Messaging March 11, 2017 On March 7, the US awoke to a fresh cache of internal CIA documents posted on WikiLeaks. They detail the spy organization’s playbook for cracking digital communications. WikiLeaks claims to have large portions of the CIA’s hacking arsenal in a series called Vault 7 (though the first information dump didn’t contain any of the code used to actually crack modern smartphones and internet-connected devices). These documents, if legitimate, show exactly how a spy agency uses a technologically-saturated culture to its own ends. As such they’re a neat foil to the National Security Agency (NSA) secrets unveiled by Edward Snowden in 2013. As NPR writes, “other leaks featured program overviews; these are developer notes.” Many of the CIA documents outlined “zero-day exploits”—undetected security loopholes—in software made by companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung. Ironically, though, the Vault 7 dump also shows just how strong modern encryption and privacy measures are. While Snowden revealed that telcos handed over data about their customers to the NSA in bulk, there is no sign in the Vault 7 documents that the CIA can hack into encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp or Signal and use that to carry out mass surveillance. To see what’s on your phone, the agency must get access to the phone itself. Zeynep Tufekci, writing in the New York Times, said security researchers she interviewed saw “no big surprises or unexpected wizardry.” There’s also one other big difference between now and 2013. Snowden’s NSA revelations sent shockwaves around the world. Despite WikiLeaks’ best efforts at theatrics—distributing an encrypted folder and tweeting the password “SplinterItIntoAThousandPiecesAndScatterItIntoTheWinds”—the Vault 7 leak has elicited little more than a shrug from the media and the public, even if the spooks are seriously worried. Maybe it’s because we already assume the government can listen to everything. This was published as part of the weekend edition of the Quartz Daily Brief.

The two Silicon Valley companies are fighting over technology that is seen as part of the foundation of the future of transportation, self-driving vehicles. The fight is also shaping up as a rematch of legal titans from another case that riveted Silicon Valley: the smartphone patent battle between Apple Inc (AAPL.O: Quote) and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS: Quote). Morrison Foerster, which represents Apple in that case, on Friday said it would represent Uber in the suit by Alphabet. Alphabet is represented by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, which represents Samsung. Waymo sued Uber last month over allegations that a former employee downloaded and stole more than 14,000 confidential files, including details on light detection and ranging sensor technology known as Lidar. Uber has denied the claims. It did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Lidar systems are similar to radar and shoot light beams to map out a street or environment. They are a crucial element of most self-driving car systems. Waymo, which originally said that two Lidar patents were infringed, on Friday in an amended complaint added a third patent. It also said that Uber infringed unpatented trade secrets, such as parameters and measurements for the light beam used in Lidar. It also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on the Lidar technology in question.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Security Well-known iPhone hacker says nothing in CIA dump threatens up-to-date iPhones Image Source: Oliur Rahman Mike Wehner @MikeWehner March 8th, 2017 at 12:38 PM Share Tweet Of all the mobile devices featured in the alleged CIA documentation dump released by Wikileaks earlier this week, the iPhone is mentioned the most. Pages upon pages of research and exploits related to Apple’s smartphone are now in the hands of anyone with an internet connection. It might seem like a reason to panic, and plenty of people are already doing just that, but according to one of the most well-respected iPhone hackers on the planet, nothing in the collection of information should pose any threat to an up-to-date iPhone. Don't Miss: Google’s Pixel copied the iPhone 6, and it looks like the Pixel 2 will copy the iPhone 7 Will Strafach is the CEO of Verify.ly, a software security firm specializing in mobile devices. He also used to be one of the most famous iOS jailbreakers around, and his opinion on mobile security exploits is one of the very few that you should actually care about. He’s taken a look at the CIA documents related to the iPhone, and doesn’t see anything to worry about — assuming you’re running the latest firmware. I have found nothing in the dump which an attacker could use to hack an iOS device on latest firmware (and older firmwares have public JBs) https://t.co/gnWDRX8tOz — Will Strafach (@chronic) March 8, 2017 “The one thing I was at least able to definitively clear up is this: the leak contains nothing which an attacker could download and use to hack an up-to-date mobile phone (iOS),” Strafach told us. “Android experts have said the same regarding android devices on the latest firmware as well, which is interesting as it demonstrates that Android (again, on latest firmware) can be decently secure just like iOS.” So what about the people claiming the information included in the leak is of dire security concern to everyone with an iOS device? “The best you can do is to ask anyone who claims danger within this leak to go ahead and prove it,” Strafach says. “I guarantee you that if you ask someone to download this leak and try to use the information in it to hack your phone, they would fail.” The seasoned security expert also wants to clear up some misconceptions about the government potentially keeping vulnerabilities secret rather than reporting them. “Some imply keeping a vulnerability private will make users unsafe,” Strafach explains. “This is an ethical debate rather than a technical one and is up to opinion, but what I can at least say is that the practice is also prevalent among experienced security researchers who need to maintain access to future revisions of an OS in order to continued their research to find new vulnerabilities, which they may either disclose or submit to a bug bounty, or create a jailbreak tool for, etc.” “While I agree that it can be healthy sometimes to question government and call out actual abuse, in this situation, it is more about having a level playing field and I do not believe there is an ethical issue here,” Strafach says.

Meet Joy who loves to  explore places and meet people  to give her an opportunity to learn from other cultures and characters.  What’s inside your bag? My bag contains [my] make up kit, hand lotion and hand sanitizer aside from my other personal belongings like wallet and phone. Nothing beats clean hands! I guess a bag must basically contain things that are useful for our daily activities.  What electronic gadgets are you currently using? For my laptop I am using a Macbook and an iPhone for my phone. It’s a fact that Apple products have always have the good quality and more advanced.  What’s inside your closet? Mostly my dresses from different collections are the major stuff inside my closet. I like glamour office attires, which I can also wear for evening events. I am also into shoes and handbags which occupy the most space in my closet. What is your style of clothing? Talking about my style cannot be defined in one corner. We have to be flexible. For me, it depends on the weather and occasion. Living in Dubai you can see me with fit clothes during summer and you can see me with fur during winter and sportswear every morning as I hit the gym or if I am just at home spending my time painting and  when I am with my music,  I  just merely wear my rugged clothes. What clothing brands do you think closely fit your sense of fashion?  I don’t really have a clothing brand in particular, when I shop, I visit every store and find something that fits my body type. My principle is this: If it looks good on you, buy it! No matter what brand it is, as I shop depending on what makes me look good not just the hype.  That would help you boost confidence.  What is your favorite perfume?  Chloé Eu du Parfum, it has a fresh powdery floral scent which makes me feel happy and boost my self-esteem and femininity. What is your favorite brand of shoes?  I both like Louboutin and Valentino.  I invest in a pair of good quality shoes as those brands produce comfortable shoes, more durable and they last longer especially [since] I always love to wear heels so I need to have a good quality pair of shoes. Are you a shopaholic?  Yes, I was before to be honest, but when I started earning from my own sweat, I intended not to, but I treat myself once in a while. We all have to admit that buying something new (new car, new dress, new shoes, new bags) makes us feel great but it’s only passive. For as long as you are not spending beyond your budget, then that’s totally fine!  What inspires or influences you to buy an item? I normally buy stuff for my basic needs or replacing old items but if I see great deals on the stores, I don’t want to miss the opportunity!              What brands do you trust for your skin care? I use SK-II and Shiseido for my face. I am very careful when buying products for my skin especially since I have acne prone skin. That’s why these two brands stand out for me. I also use Nivea shower gel and Nivea Lotion ever since. What is a Branded Pinoy for you? Branded Pinoy for me is someone who has a positive outlook in life. Our brains are wired to find things we are looking for. If you are always cynical or waiting for things to go wrong, then your life will reflect that. On the other hand, having a positive outlook in life will bring you joy and provide you with inspiration when you least expect it.  Facebook Comments Website Comments free pron March 6th, 2017 Reply HL5bYg Pretty!

Unpacking the chicken box: The story behind Baltimore's carryout staple News Opinion Op-Eds Cal Thomas: Wiki-flood 10 years of WikiLeaks A glimpse at the history of WikiLeaks, which has been publishing news leaks and secret information for 10 years. A glimpse at the history of WikiLeaks, which has been publishing news leaks and secret information for 10 years. Cal Thomas Congress has an obligation to look into CIA hacking tactics revealed by WikiLeaks, says Cal Thomas. Most Americans, I suspect, have the attitude that if the government is spying on someone there is probably a good reason. In the latest document dump by WikiLeaks, Julian Assange's outfit may cause some to rethink that premise. Mr. Assange, who is viewed by some as a patriot and by others as a traitor for exposing American secrets and putting the country in jeopardy, has, reports The Washington Post, "obtained a vast portion of the CIA's computer hacking arsenal" and has begun "posting the files online in a breach that may expose some of the U.S. intelligence community's most closely guarded cyber weapons." The trove, reportedly, exceeds "...in scale and significance the massive collection of National Security Agency documents exposed by former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden." Mr. Assange claims that the 8,761 CIA documents account for "the entire hacking capacity of the CIA." He promises there are more documents to come. Certain malware allow the CIA access to familiar U.S. and European commercial products, including Apple's iPhone, Google's Android, Macintosh Windows and even Smart TVs, which, once enabled, could pick up your living room chatter. Attorney John Whitehead, who heads The Rutherford Institute, which self-describes as "A nonprofit conservative legal organization dedicated to the defense of civil, especially religious, liberties and human rights," says he is not surprised at the extent of government spying. In a statement, Mr. Whitehead writes: "...government agencies such as the CIA and the NSA have been spying on the citizenry through our smart TVs, listening in on our phone calls, hacking into our computerized devices (including our cars) and compromising our security systems through the use of spyware and malware." Mr. Whitehead calls the latest WikiLeaks revelations a confirmation of what he and his organization have warned about for years, namely, that "the government remains the greatest threat to our freedoms" and "these government programs are illegal, unconstitutional, unwarranted and illegitimate. The only way things will change is if we force the government to start playing by the rules of the Constitution." I used to regard such statements as extreme and coming mainly from the left, but now I'm not so sure. There is no doubt that terrorists and American enemies, such as China and Russia, can and have used our U.S. Constitution, the freedoms it guarantees and the protection against government intrusion on our privacy and liberties against us, but does that mean that in order to protect those liberties the government must undermine them? Doesn't that seem self-defeating? In its oversight capacity, Congress needs to explore what these documents have revealed about the CIA and its tactics. If limited government means anything, surely it means limiting government from the power to invade the privacy of its citizens without warrants and due process. As John Whitehead puts it: "That means putting an end to this shadow government -- with its secret agencies, secret military operations, secret surveillance, secret budgets, secret court rulings and secret interpretations of the law -- all of which exist beyond our reach, operate outside our knowledge, and do not answer to 'we the people.'" This ought not be a partisan issue, though some can be counted on to turn it into one. Freedom is a precious commodity, which can never be taken for granted. It is always in danger of being reduced by the powerful without proper safeguards and watchdogs. There may be damage done to some of these government agencies and their ability to pursue real enemies, but the damage caused to the Constitution and our freedoms could be worse. Congress has an obligation to look into this flood of documents and what they reveal. Readers may email Cal Thomas at tcaeditors@tribpub.com.

People around the globe waited in long lines to be among the first to purchase both the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. The phones offer longer battery life, faster browsing, a better camera and do not have a traditional headphone jack. (Photo : Spencer Platt/Getty Images) When a phone's software is ready for updating, users tend not to think twice about getting the latest version of its operating system. However, Apple's upcoming iOS 10.3 update is going to make important changes that might put a user's data at risk. As such, users are advised to backup all vital details before downloading the update. As noted by Mashable, the Cupertino-based tech giant will be unveiling a new file system with iOS 10.3. This is why users should be backing up their files now while they can. The update is expected to begin rolling out by the end of the month. Business Insider called it the new Apple File System. This will replace the company's 30-year-old file system, HFS+. This is the file system that is currently found on all iOS devices. All devices will automatically convert to AFS once they are upgraded to iOS 10.3 However, if there are glitches that occur within the upgrade, then files are at the risk of being lost. But even then, there is the risk that the files will not be read correctly anymore. In other words, files will not be readily transferable between operating system updates, simply because iOS 10.3 will not be able to read it. So if some details are lost within applications, it is not guaranteed that the items will be retrieved, or can be used again. Developers have been playing around and learning about iOS 10.3 for about a month now and the general notion seems to be a positive one. The publication has reported that the new file system is quite popular, particularly because it will allow these third-party developers to do various other things with their pages, which HFS+ did not. This includes a stronger encryption, better management of large date, smaller space requirements, protection of files from crashes and improved times stamps.

New Econet Home Wallet gives diasporans control of their remittances to Zimbabwe – Nehanda Radio Home News Politics Business Opinion Bizarre Courts Local Diaspora World Showbiz Sports Search 15 C Harare Friday, March 17, 2017 About Us Contact Us Advertising Listen to Radio Privacy Policy Who is Who News Alerts Nehanda Radio Home News Politics Business Opinion Bizarre Courts Local Diaspora World Showbiz Sports Home Business New Econet Home Wallet gives diasporans control of their remittances to Zimbabwe Business Diaspora News Popular New Econet Home Wallet gives diasporans control of their remittances to Zimbabwe Mar 10, 2017 14 8382 By Staff Reporter UK diaspora customers will now have access to the Ecocash wallet as if they were in Zimbabwe and enjoy the ability to remit funds and pay for goods and services using the newly launched Ecocash Home Wallet app. The team launching the new product. From left to right Louis Charema (CMG), Owen Takadiyi (GM Marketing – EcoCash Zimbabwe) Natalie Jabangwe-Morris (EcoCach CEO), George Chirwa (Econet Group Executive), Haxton Rose (Managing Director of Cassava Remit UK), Conrad Mwanza (CMG Group) Econet Group’s fintech subsidiary, Cassava Connect (formerly Chitoro), unveiled the product in London on Thursday, calling it ‘a first in the world of remittances between the UK and Zimbabwe’. Cassava is the company through which all EcoCash mobile money services are managed across Africa. For the first time ever, Zimbabweans in the diaspora are now able to take direct control of how the money they remit to Zimbabwe is used. They can sign up for the EcoCash mobile money service via the Ecocash Home Wallet app, and link it to their UK mobile number. The app is available for download on the Google Play Store and Apple store. Once registered, a user in the UK will be able to top up their Home Wallet through a debit or credit card or bank transfer, which will allow them to send money home and perform all other transactions available on EcoCash in Zimbabwe such as pay bills, pay merchants, or buy airtime. Natalie Jabangwe-Morris (EcoCach CEO) Haxton Rose, Managing Director of Cassava Remit UK, described the new service as “a response to long standing calls by the diaspora community for a transaction offering that provides speed, comfort, control, and security of funds remitted back home.” He said the launch comes with a three month zero fees offer for top-ups to the wallet, while all in-wallet transactions remain free after topping the wallet. Natalie Jabangwe-Morris, General Manager for EcoCash Zimbabwe, said: “Gone are the days of having to queue at a high street shop to send money home, wait for several days for the money transfer to go through, and then having to rely on someone to handle other transactions in Zimbabwe on your behalf such as paying for school fees or any other projects back home. “Regrettably, in such scenarios, we have heard of many instances where the money ends up being misappropriated. This is where the EcoCash Home Wallet comes in handy as the customer not only gets access to a remittance capability, but also gets direct control over how the funds will be used downstream.” Cassava has so far excelled in developing and introducing such innovations across the markets in which it operates, which has in turn enhanced the equity of the EcoCash brand as seen at the just ended Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, where EcoCash was recognised as the Best Mobile Money Solution in the World for 2017.

LIKE   TWEET   SHARE   PIN   SHARE   POST MAIL MORE Posted March 11, 2017 at 7:18am by iClarified · 6786 views · Translate The iPhone 8 will reportedly have a flat display, not a curved one like some reports are predicting, according to IHS Markit analyst Wayne Lam. "We anticipate Apple will adopt a flat implementation of OLED design on their special iPhone model, which is analogous to the current 2.5D glass design," Lam told MacRumors. "Much like the recently announced LG G6, we anticipate a touchscreen with a new longer aspect ratio design to take advantage of higher coverage area of the iPhone in its entirety. This new design language is expected to become the trend for 2017, as we all anticipate Samsung's reveal later this month." Notably, this lines up with recent predictions from TrendForce and the well respected Ming-Chi Kuo. It's possible that some of the curved display rumors we're hearing are actually referring to the slightly curve on the edges that the current generation iPhones already have. We'll know more once production gets underway and parts start leaking online. Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

The most annoying feature on the phone is the curved screen, because if you hold your phone using two hands and your thumb just touches the edge your screen either does things you don't want or it doesn't respond to the actions you do with the other hand. Reply · Like · Mark as Spam Jack - March 12, 2017 at 4:06pm The iPhone had a similar issue with a flat screen. They fixed it a few years back with an iOS update. But I go agree with you it is annoying as I too have a EDGE G7 and an iPhone 7P. I hope they fixed this flaw on the new Galaxy S8.
